M Rodman was bred a merchant and is generally admitted to be an excellent accountant and man of business. Various circumstances afterwards led him to the study and profession of the law in which he acquired a respectable standing and held for some time the lucrative and honourable place of District Attorney for the city of New York. Some important business (in the result of which however he was unfortunately disappointed) induced him to resign this office and go to Europe. Being now a widower, having not yet recovered his professional business, and believing that a southern climate would be favorable to his general health he is now induced to try his fortunes in Florida. He has paid great attention to modern languages and the civil and continental law. He writes and speaks French with much accuracy and fluency and is generally acquainted with the modes of transacting both public and commercial business on the continent of Europe. He is besides a man of fair character and of indefatigable industry. Should the collectorships, for which I understand that he applies, be otherwise bestowed, M. R. is well qualified for several others of the offices which will be probably erected under the territorial government. I am with great respect Your obedient Servant GULIAN C.

"LC: Jackson Papers, Vol. 59: LS*",Correspondence,THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO COMMISSIONER AND GOVERNOR JACKSON,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,COMMISSIONER AND GOVERNOR JACKSON,"MAJOR GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON. SIR, By direction of the President of the United States, I have the honor of transmitting to you three Commissions, 1.-As Commissioner to receive possession of the Provinces of East and West Florida, conformably to the Treaty between the United States and Spain, concluded on the 22"" of February 1819.â€ 2. As Governor of the whole Territories of which possession is to be thus taken.â€ 3. As Commissionerâ€ vested with Special and extraordinary powers,â€ conformably to the stipulations of the Treaty and to the Act of Congress for carrying the same into execution; copies of both which are also among the enclosures with this letter. Together with the Spanish Ratification of the Treaty, there was transmitted to the Spanish Minister at this place a Royal Order, to the Captain General and Governor of the Island of Cuba,â€ for delivering possession of the Provinces of East and West Florida, according to the Stipulations of the second article of the Treaty. Colonel James G. Forbes has been appointed by the President Agent & Commissary to deliver this Royal Order to the Governor of Cuba,â€ to concert and arrange with him the execution of it, and to receive any documents or archives which may be at the Havanna, and which are stipulated to be delivered by this article. A copy of his Instructions is herewith enclosed; "" by which you will perceive, that he is to deliver over to you all such documents or archives as he may receive at the Havanna. It is desirable that those relating to each of the two Provinces should be kept distinct from each other, and that this Government should be informed generally of their character and quantity. Colonel Forbes is to take passage at New York, in the United States Sloop of War Hornet, Captain Read;"" and, on arriving at Pensacola, is to give you immediate notice, that you may repair thither to receive possession of that place. The Hornet is to remain there to escort the transports, in which the Spanish officers and troops, and their baggage, are to be conveyed to the Havanna. The Spanish Minister has expressed a strong wish, that no troops of the United States may be introduced into Pensacola or St. Augustine, until after the evacuation by those of Spain. The object of this request being to avoid any possible unpleasant altercations between the soldiers of the two nations, the President thinks it reasonable to comply with it, unless you should be of opinion that it will be attended with inconvenience. In that event, he relies that you will take every measure of precaution which may be necessary to guard against any such collisions between the soldiers; and he trusts with confidence that in every arrangement for the evacuation, the utmost delicacy will be observed to avoid every thing which might tend to wound the feelings of any of the Spanish officers, soldiers, or subjects, who are to remove. It is the President's desire, that you should appoint General Gaines,â€ or such other Officer as you may deem expedient, to receive possession of St. Augustine; and that the same Instructions should be applied to the execution of that Service. The United States' Brig Enterprize, or Sch. Porpoise, will be ordered to proceed to that place, to escort the transports which are to convey the Spanish officers and troops thence to the Havanna. The care of providing the transports at both places is referred to you. The number of troops at either place is not known, but supposed to amount to about 500 men at each. The stipulation is understood to include civil as well as military officers, and provisions as well as passage: Instructions will be given by the Secretary of War to the Quarter-Masters * and Commissaries to furnish to your orders provisions and transports for the conveyance of the Spanish officers and troops. It is expected they will be supplied at New Orleans and Mobile, for those to embark within the Gulph, and at Savannah and Charleston for those going from St. Augustine. A copy and translation of the Royal Order to the Governor of Cuba, for delivering the possession of the Provinces, are among the enclosures herewith. You will observe, that it includes expressly the islands appertinent to them. It will be proper that attention should be paid to taking possession of all these islands; but it may not be necessary that a formal delivery of them in every case should be made. On receiving from the Governors of West and East Florida possession of those respective Provinces, it will be proper to exchange certificates of the time and mode of the transaction: orders for the delivery of any military posts within the Provinces will be expected, and they will be occupied by detachments of our troops as you may deem expedient. As soon as the possession shall be transferred, you will, in pursuance of your authority over the ceded territories, issue proclamations announcing the fact. A form,â€ adopted from that which was issued on the first occupation of Louisiana,"" is herewith enclosed, to be modified as the circumstances in your opinion may require. The powers, vested in you by the enclosed Commissions, are also conformable to those which were entrusted to the Governor of Louisiana,"" under an Act of Congress of similar import."" The President is satisfied that they will be exercised by you with a due regard as well to the privileges and usages of the inhabitants under the Government to which they have been subject, as to the personal and social rights to which they will be entitled by the stipulations of the Treaty, and as associates to the Union of these States. The money paid into the Spanish treasury before the delivery of possession, and whatever may be due thereto at that date, is to be considered as the property of Spain. Payments and debts subsequent to that date, will belong of course to the United States. The laws of the United States relating to the revenue and its collection, and those relating to the introduction of persons of color, being extended, by the Act of Congress, to the Territory,"" the execution of them will be superintended by officers to be appointed for the several collection districts to be established by the President conformably to the law. Your compensation as Governor will be at the rate of five thousand dollars a year. As Commissioner for receiving possession of the Provinces,â€ such reasonable expenses as may be incurred will be allowed. Whenever your military command ceases, your salary as Governor will commence. In the taking of possession of St. Augustine and East-Florida, similar proceedings to those relative to the occupation of West-Florida will be proper. Both Provinces being placed under your direction, the Proclamation to be issued there will be in your name; and General Gaines, or such other officer as you may appoint, will be instructed to consider himself, for all the purposes of the Government, subject to your orders. At the ensuing session of Congress, it is to be presumed one of the earliest objects of attention to that body will be, to make further provision for the Government of these territories.â€ The President wishes you, in the interval, to collect and communicate to this Department any information, relating to the country and its inhabitants, which may be useful to the exercise of the legislative authority of the Union concerning them. For the expenses incident to the services herewith required, you will draw upon this Department. Strict economy is to be observed in incurring them; and I have urgently to request the transmission, as early as possible, of all the accounts resulting from them with the vouchers necessary for their settlement at the Treasury.""

Nashville. SIR, By the second article of the Florida Treaty, it is stipulated that with the Territories of East and West Florida, the fortifications within the same, are ceded and to be delivered to the United States; but no express mention is made of the Cannon, belonging to them. By the seventh Article of the same Treaty, it is provided that the United States shall furnish the transports and escort necessary to convey the Spanish Officers and troops, and their baggage to the Havannaâ€”But no mention is made of the transportation of Cannon; nor is there any express engagement on the part of the United States, to furnish provisions to the Spanish Officers and Troops on the passage. It is the opinion of the President, that by a fair and just construction of the Treaty, the Cannon belonging to the fortifications are to be considered as appendages to them, included in the Cession, and are therefore to be left with them. On the same principle he is of opinion, that with the transports and escort to convey the Spanish Officers and troops and their baggage, the provisions necessary for the passage, are also to be furnished at the expence of the United States, although not specially mentioned in the Treaty; and orders have accordingly been given for the supply of provisions. It is however possible that the Spanish Governors of East and West Florida, may upon a different construction of the Treaty, claim to carry away the Cannon from the fortifications, because they are not expressly named in the Article. You will in that case claim that they should be left with the fortifications, and insist that upon the principle of the other Construction the United States are not bound to furnish provisions for the passage of the Officers and troopsâ€”You will state that the supply has been ordered in the Confidence, that the benefit of the same liberal Construction of the Treaty will operate in favour of the United States; and that if it be not extended to them, they will have a just claim to be reimbursed for the expence of supplying the provisons. You will add that as there is no engagement on their part express or implied, to furnish the means of transporting the Cannon, they have made and can make no provision for that purpose. Should the Spanish Governors alledge that their orders are express, for having the Cannon carried away, you will leave it to them to make provision for their transportation, and report forthwith the facts to this Department.â€ I am, with great Respect, Sir, your very humble and Obed"" Serv"" JOHN QUINCY ADAMS [Endorsed] 23 March Letter of Instructions from the Sec of State to Gen' Jackson in the relation to the ordinance in Florida NÂ° 2",1821,March,23,1821-03-23,Department of State WASHINGTON,469,1821.0323

Penieres has been appointed by the President sub-agent to the Indians in Florida and placed under your superintendence as Governor of Florida. I enclose for your information a copy of the instructions to him.â€ He is a gentleman eminent for his various acquirements, who being forced from France for political reasons has selected this country for his residence, and who, in order to become intimately acquainted with the Indian character has resided several years among the Indians in the Arkansas Territory.â€ The knowledge which Mr Penieres has thus acquired of their Character, his familiar acquaintance with the Spanish language, and his talents and acquirements will, it is believed, make him very useful. The fact of his being a Frenchman will, it is thought, in no degree disqualify him for the duties assigned to him; on the contrary, the Indians have ever shown to the French a strong attachment, and it may be considered as favorable to the successful discharge of his duties. You will give M* Penieres such additional instructions as you may deem proper. In the selection of an Interpreter, which is of considerable importance, you will probably be able to give him such information as may be very useful. We have not yet made formal peace with the Seminoles. Should you deem it necessary for that purpose, or to impress them more solemnly with the new relation in which they stand to us, you are authorized to appoint a special Commissioner, to whom you may allow a suitable compensation, for the purpose, thro' whom you may make such communication as you may judge the state of the Case to require. In the first pressure of emigration and the uncertain extent of the portion of Florida which may be claimed by the Indians, it is to be feared that some collision may take place between them and our citizens; to avoid which it would seem to be advisable to ascertain from the Spanish authority, as well as the Indians themselves, the extent and limits of the country to which they have a just claim, and to give such information for the guidance of persons who may wish to emigrate or explore the country as you may think proper- The President reposing every confidence in your discretion and judgement, does not think it necessary to give more minute or full instructions, as he doubts not that, in the discharge of your duty, the measures the best calculated to promote the public interest will be adopted by you.â€ I have the honor to be, Your Obed"" Serv"" J.

Your compensation will be at the rate of $500 per year; but as your duties previous to your permanent location will involve you in very considerable expense, your extra expense provided it does not with your pay as Agent exceed $1200 per year will be allowed. You will be allowed an interpreter whose compensation will be at the rate of $400 but as no person suitable to discharge the duties of this office is known to the Department the appointment will be postponed till a proper selection can be made. In the mean time you are authorized with the assent of the Superintendent to employ a person to act as interpretor at the rate above stated till one can be appointed by the Department. The person whom you may so appoint you will through the Superintendent report to this Dept and also state whether he possesses the necessary qualifications for the permanent discharge of the duties of an interpretor. Your salary with personal expenses in the discharge of your duty, the salary of the Interpretor and such contingent expenses as may be attendant on your intercourse with the Tribes, such as small presents, provisions &c, will be remitted to you quarterly on your estimates transmitted to this Dep"" through the superintendent and approved by him. Your general duty will be indicated by the act of Congress regu- lating intercourse with the Indian Tribesâ€ of which a copy is enclosed; but the recent acquisition of Florida and the new relation which has in consequence been created between the United States and the Indians residing within its limits, will impose on you new and peculiar duties. It is important that the Government should know as early as practicable the number of Indians residing in Florida, their various Tribes, the country occupied by them and their disposition towards the U. States. To obtain this knowledge you will visit the various portions of the Country inhabited by Indians; and take the necessary measures to obtain the information required, as accurately as may be practicable which you will without delay report through the Superintendent to this Department. You will ascertain not only the portion of the country which they may actually inhabit but also the extent claimed by them; and the extent of cessions which at various times may have been made by them to the Spanish or the English Governments. In the performance of this duty you will visit the greater portion of the Territory and you will avail yourself of the opportunity which it will afford to become acquainted with the character of the country including its Geography, Geology, climate, soil, & face of the country & its productions animal, vegitable & Mineral, all of which you will accarately notice and report as above directed, accompanied by such observations and reflections as you may think proper. You will make the Indians acquainted with their new relations to the U. States and impress on them an assurance of being protected provided they demean themselves peaceably. Situated as they are and surrounded as they must in a short time be with the white population, it will probably become desirable both to them and us to make hereafter a new Disposition of them either by concentrating them at some one point in Florida, or by giving them a new home in some other part of the U. States. You will sound them on this point when your residence among them has been sufficiently long to enable you to do it with prudence. Gen' Jackson has been authorized should he deem it adviseable, to appoint a special commissioner to accompany you to the Seminole Indians in order to make such representation and immediate arrangements with them as he may judge necessary. The duties which are assigned to you are important and the Pres' confides in your industry, zeal and ability for their faithful discharge.

During that campaign I ordered the conquered Indians above the Florida line, and directed them to settle down within their own limits (the Creek Nation) I have lately however understood that MÂ° Queen and his adherrents have made a settlement at Mickasuckey and also on the Suwaney river.â€”Are these Indians to be ordered up to the Creek Country, there to settle themselves, or are they to be protected in their new settlement? I have only to remark that the Country set apart for the Creek Nation is sufficient for the support of all, & that by removing those within Florida greater security will be given to our frontier, and the Government would more certainly be enabled to prevent smuggleing, which no doubt will be attempted to a considerable extent thro the various inlets in the Country now inhabited by them.

"LC: Jackson Papers, Vol. 59: LS",Correspondence,THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO COMMISSIONER AND GOVERNOR JACKSON,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,COMMISSIONER AND GOVERNOR JACKSON,"SIR, On the receipt of your letter of the 10"" of last month, I submitted the point in your account, which you presented, for the decision of the Attorney General,â€ as the highest law authority; and I now enclose you, for your information, his decision in the case. The 24 Auditor informs me that your account of disbursements under the Choctaw treaty,â€ will be closed, as soon as the receipt of the contractor for the $2000, paid to him by the allowance of this Department, and evidence of the payment, or deposit of the balance are transmitted to him. The Auditor will write you today giving you a statement of what the balance is after giving you a credit for the $2000 with instruction to pay it over to pay master Randall or Burch, if you have not made other disposition of it. The President has referred so much of your letter to the State Department of the 2"" April,â€ as relates to the Indians in Florida, to this Department. He is of the opinion, that no immediate measure ought to be taken, as to the Creek Indians in Florida; but that some step ought to be taken to ascertain their views, numbers &c., in order to adopt proper measures hereafter in relation both to them and the Seminoles It is certainly desireable on many accounts to remove them from Florida; but it is highly probable, that the people of Georgia would object strongly to the arrangement of ordering them to the Creek Country; as it might prolong the time of the extinguishment of the Indian title within its limits. In fact during the last session, the idea was suggested, and it was very apparent, that it would not be relished I hope, however, that some opportunity may present itself, of making an arrangement which may be satisfactory. As soon as it can be done, it will be the policy of the government to remove them. Its view on this point, was communicated to you in the copy of the instructions to the Sub-agent for the Indians in Florida, and the letter, under cover of which, it was transmitted to you.â€ I fear from the great infirmity of Gen' Porter, who was charged with the arranging and ordering the detachment of the light artillery from Boston to Amelia Island, to garrison St Augustine, that some delay may take place in their arrival. He mistook a part of the orders, which made it necessary to correct his error, and it is probable that the detachment did not sail till the 28* of last month.

He prepared a similar report in 1818 upon the defenses of Spanish West Florida. He was promoted to a captaincy in 1818 and on Oct. 1, 1820 became a colonel and Inspector General of the Southern Division under Jackson. A friend of Secretary of War Calhoun, and strongly recommended by Jackson, he was appointed, Aug. 13, 1821, Adjutant General of the Army by the President (Bassett, ed., Corr. Jackson, III, 47, 59). He served in that position only until Mar. 22, 1822, however, for the Senate refused to confirm the appointment on the ground that officers senior to him in rank had been passed over in violation of the act for the reduction of the Army approved Mar. 2, 1821 (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 266, 280, 282,292, 298; A. S. P., Mil. Affairs, II, 397). This action terminated his Army career, and he moved from Washington to Charleston. His appointment as a commissioner to negotiate a treaty with the Seminoles in Florida (post, p. 659) in 1823, through the influence of the Sec. of War (Bassett, ed., op.cit., III, 194), led to his settlement in the Territory where he was to take an important part in public affairs and in the development of the area.

This letter, with such further communications from the Secretaries of State & War, as the arrangments in Florida may re- 7"" Enclosed in a letter of July 30, 1821, from Jackson to the Secretary of State (post, p. 137). quire, will be forwarded to Milledgeville by mail, and thence by a special messenger to you at Pensacola, or elsewhere, to whatever place you may be at. The arrangments under the treaty being committed to me, by a concise law,â€ expressd in general terms, I have bestowed on the subject, all the consideration which its high importance requird, & used my best exertions, to give effect to every object contemplated by it, in a manner to satisfy the just claims of my country. Several duties distinct in their nature, were injoind on me by the Law. The territory ceded, was to be taken possession of, & the Spanish officers & soldiers were to be transferred to Cuba: a temporary gov"" was to be organizd over the Floridas, for the protection of the inhabitants, in the free enjoyment, of their liberty, property, and religion, for which purposes, the military, civil & judicial powers heretofore exercised by the authorities of Spain, should be vested in proper officers of the U States, & exercised in such manner as should be designated. The laws of the U States relating to revenue, & the slave trade, were declard to be in force in the said territories, & it was injoind on me to establish such districts, for the collection of the revenue, & to appoint such officers, whose commissions should expire at the end of the next Session of Congress, to enforce the said laws, as might be deemed expedient. The establishment of the boundary, between the U States & Spain, westward, of the Mississippi, was another object, & the institution of a board of commissioners, to consist of three persons, for the settlement of the claims of such of our citizens, as had been plunderd at sea, & elsewhere, was a third. As incident to the last, was the distribution of 5 millions of do"", should the claims amount to that sum, among such of our citizens as should be entitled thereto, on fair examination, & on just principles; and should the claims exceed that sum, by a proportionate reduction of cash, so as to render to every one justice, giving him his due, and no more, & in so doing, sustain the character of the government & nation, for integrity, and impartiality. Although those duties were distinct, and to be perform'd at places very distant from each other, yet in providing for their execution, it was necessary for me to take a combined view of the whole, and in the appointment of officers, especially, to look to the nation; distributing them among the states, so far as it might be practicable, without neglecting other objects equally important. In executing that portion of the trust relating to the Floridas, I have gratified in a high degree my feelings, in committing the chief power to you, who have render'd such important services, & have such just claims to the gratitude of your country. It must be agreeable to you, from many considerations which will occur, to take possession of the Floridas, & cause the Spanish authorities & troops to be removâ€™d to Cuba. It must be equally so, to establish the government of the U States, & to administer it, in their behalf, in those territories. I have every reason to believe that the nation generally, have beheld with profound interest and satisfaction, your appointment,â€ considering it a just tribute of respect, to your extraordinary services & merit, & having the fullest confidence that its duties will be discharged, with the utmost ability & integrity. As the territory had been divided into two provinces, under Spain, & still retained that form, notwithstanding all that part of W. Florida, west of the Perdido, had been taken from it,â€ and more especially, as Pensacola & S*Augustine were separated at such a distance, and by a wilderness, it was thought adviseable, for the present, to adopt the arrangement, in some of its parts, to that circumstance. In regard to your office, both provinces will form but one territory. Your powers will be the same over the whole; but as your residence will be fixd at one only, and as I presume at Pensacola, I have thought it proper to appoint two Secretaries, one for Pensacola, & the other for S*Augustine, both equally under your controul. I have divided the territory, with a view to revenue, into three districts, that portion which lies between the S. Marys & Cape Florida into one, S*Augustine being its port of entry & delivery; that, between the Cape & the Apalachicola, into another, S' Marks being its port; and that lying between the Apalachicola & the Perdido into a third, Pensacola, being its port. I have established two judicial districts, one Judge in each, Pensacola to be the residence of one, & S*Augustine of the other. I have appointed M."" Fromentin, judge at the former, & Mr Duvall, at the latter.â€ Both those gentlemen I presume you are acquainted with, the one having servd in the Senate from Louisiana, & the other in the house of Rep"" from Kentucky.

It is, I believe, customary, for the revenue officers to be thus provided, wherever it is practicable, and in no instances, can such provision be more important or indispensible to the parties than the present.

Smugglers & slave traders will hide their heads; pirates will disappear, & the Seminoles, cease to give us trouble. So effectual will the impression be, that I think, the recollection of your past worries, will smoothe your way as to the future. Past experience shews, that neither of us are without enemies. If you still have any, as may be presumed, they will watch your mov'ments, hoping to find some inadvertent circumstance, to turn against you. Be therefore on your guard.

Other correspondence in these files, of a more routine character, relates to the sureties of attorneys and marshals and their returns of court actions and executions. altho' you have pointed out to me that it was believed on your part, that a more summary mode than that I have proposed was the persuasion in which your government was would be observed, I must remark that attending to what the treaty Royal schedule of delivery, orders of my Captain Gen' and the importance of the same affair merits I have thought the proposal the most analogical and worthy to fill the objects, altho I am disposed to rectify it in any of the parts that do not agree or are unnecessary in the insinuated requisites. Coinciding with the ideas that you have manifested me it is my desire that our respective Commissions be complied with as soon as possible; but having, received at the same time the order for the delivery of this Province, with those that ought to have been communicated ere this, to prepare and facilitate said delivery, is therefore the cause that it cannot be executed in all its parts with that despatch we desire: On that account I request your attention in respect to the advices and intelligence my government has given me, regulated to the treaty to make known to all the inhabitants of the country, in as much as that part stipulated in respect to them, as also the particular steps they have determined, shall be taken for those who wish to emigrate to various parts of the Spanish Dominions: The Artillery, military stores, and ammunition, that are to be transported is another of the important points, the operation of which demands some order and time; in this particular as well as others, altho' they are not of as much consequence, it is requisite to execute them. I therefore consider it necessary we should establish a private conference, a medium by which we can conciliate our respective opinions, and accellerate its brevity, for which case I reserve manifesting you my observations, that united with those you may uniformly make, can be formalized in a species of Convention that will point out with exactitude the method of the operation and will deliver us from some difficulties that generally occur in such cases. In answer to the first particular of your note of the 8* ins** enclosing you a circumstantial account of the Military force of this Garrison, including the families belonging thereto; likewise another, of those employed in this place under the immediate dependancy of the National Finance, both one and the other, with their respective remarks for the ends that may be thought necessary.â€ Before leaving off this subject, rendering your government the honor and justice it merits, I pay them the tribute of my sincere thanks for the liberal sense given to the 7*Article of the treaty, generously supplying the necessary provisions during the voyage of the officers, troops and those persons employed in the finance, and to you sir, for the frankness you have manifested, and which no doubt will shorten our future communications. As I have heretofore expressed, I think it proper there should be a personal interview for arranging the embarkation of said Artillery, military Stores, and ammunition, and other particulars which I wish to communicate. We will then determine positively the day on which the delivery of the province under my charge can be effected, as all other calculations would be useless without such an antecedent agreement. In respect to the Lotts, Squares, public edifices, fortifications, Barracks and other public property, with the documents and archives that appertain directly to the right and sovreignty of this province, you can immediately designate the person or persons that are to receive the inventories plans &c, to prepare and advise the needful (for the purpose of advancing this operation) to the Commandant of engineers of this City, for the delivery of each of the respective departments, and also the documents appertaining to individual property, and those alluding to the sovreignty of the province, for which I will give the competent order, when I am advised by you of those chosen for the purpose. To give you as I wish an exact account of the adjacent Islands to this province, is almost beyond my power, for the want of a general map that deleniates their positions, extension and circumstances, but with the exception of Amelia, which is in the posession of the United States, and that, forming the harbor of this port, known by the name of St Anastacia, on which is situated the look out house, all the rest are nearly without population, as likewise the public lands: you will therefore have a knowledge of those to be taken posession of as Gov"" property, under the impression there may be of their not being granted. I beleive want of exactitude will Suffer no difficulties to arise, seeing the good faith and long posession the Spanish Government has had of them since the treaty concluded between her and great Brittain in Versailles the 19* Sept 1783, in which no particular specification is made of said islands, nor is there any document relative to the affair. The plain and ingenuous manifestation with which I have tried to satisfy the particulars contained in your note of the 8"" must convince you of the friendly disposition to fill the Commission confided to me, with that harmony and friendship which has untill now guided us, and which I am certain will not be interrupted, as I have the greatest opinion of the amiable qualities which adorn you.

Your communication therefore with him will be proper. If this plan is not adopted, we must order Gen' Jackson not to move. I think however the true course is as stated in my communication. Avoiding collision with the Spanish troops there is no danger, and it puts the delay, if imputable to the Spanish officers; & the perfidy, if imputable to the govt, in a more odious light, & forces with more certainty the effect. To stand where we are, or move back, would |be expose us eminently, the territory being ours. Perhaps it might be best simply to state to the Spanish minister, that we our troops could not remain where they are on account of sickness. and had movd forward, in expectation that the Spanish troops would soon evacuate.

There are two points in your note, which claim on my part explanation. The 1* relates to the following Sentence, as given by you in quotation from my note of the 10"" Viz â€œFortifications with their dependancies or appertaining defencesâ€ as this is calculated to give impressions different from what was expressed, I beg to be excused for giving the annexed quotation from the Copy in my possession bearing date the 8"" and not the 10"" ins"" and which is in the following words Viz â€œFortifications with their appendant defences.â€ The second point relates to the expression in your Excellencys note just received, and of which the following is a quotation â€œThat your Government considered the Artillery Ammunition and ordnance stores that are in the fortifications appertaining to them by right and that such effects are comprehended in the meaning of the cession. Opposed to which I insert the following quotation, from my note of the 13"" ins"" and to which you allude Wiz â€œthat my government considered the Artillery in the fortifications appendant and of right belonging to them and embraced in the meaning and intention of the cession and therefore to be left with them!â€ From this expression your Excellency will certainly perceive that the United States laid no claim to the ammunition and ordnance stores. Could I think myself at liberty to enter into discussion on the merits of the construction which my government has given to the treaty in relation to the Artillery, I flatter myself that I could convince you satisfactorily that the meaning and intention of the contracting parties were, that the Artillery in the fortifications was appendant to and should remain with them. Such would also appear to have been the impression of the Cap"". Gen' of Cuba from his order to you of the 5"" Ultimo, (a copy of which I have received from the United States Commissioner from Cuba) in which he does not require the removal of the Artillery, added to which, the total silence of the 7"" Article of the treaty on the subject of furnishing transportation for the Artillery, ammunition, and ordnance Stores, or even provisions for the subsistence of the Troops on their passage. As I feel myself authorized to infer from your note of the 14"" ins"" that you are determined to remove the Artillery; it becomes my duty to enter my protest against the measure. But before appending it to this communication, I would suggest that should you feel authorized to form a different conclusion with regard to the Artillery, and determine to leave it, I will engage to furnish a reasonable proportion of transportation for the Ammunition and ordnance stores; but on the other hand should you still determine to remove the Artillery I do hereby respectfully protest against the measure, and declare that I do not consider the U. States bound, to furnish either transportation or escort for the Artillery, ammunition and ordnance stores, and that they have and will exercise a claim on the Spanish government, as well for the Artillery, so removed, as the provisions which they have procured for the subsistence, of the Spanish troops from this to the Havana, should the same be made use of. As this point now remains for decision exclusively with you, and should that decision correspond with the sentiments contained in your last note, I consider it placed out of the pale of my duties, and subject to future discussion between our two respective Governments alone. I have to request that the public property at Amelia Island will also embraced in the plans preparing by the Com"" of Engineers.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, v1:C",Correspondence,GOVERNOR CALLAVA TO COMMISSIONER AND GOVERNOR JACKSON,GOVERNOR CALLAVA,COMMISSIONER AND GOVERNOR JACKSON,"(Copy) Translation Don Jose Callava to General Jackson. MOST EXCELLENT SIR, I received yesterday your Excellency's communication of the 12"" instant,â€ dated at Montpelier, and am advised of your having received mine of the 10** as also of the answer you were pleased to make to it. ------------e ... viie Forulucations, are to be considered as annexed to them, and included in the cession; you then go on to suggest some reflections of your own, and conclude by stating that you are directed as Commissary to insist that by the stipulations of the 2"" article of the Treaty, the Cannon found in the Fortifications and constituting their batteries are dependencies on them, and included in the Cession, and that they should be delivered with the armament generally belonging to that work. That Your Excellency may not have room to doubt in the least the firmness of the argument to which I must reduce my reply, the object of which is, by avoiding all digressions relative to the particulars of your letter, to spare that time which is so necessary to us both for the fulfilment of our respective duties, as regards the receipt and delivery of West Florida, I must be somewhat diffuse, though diffinitive and conclusive. . I must then begin by assuring Your Excellency that I respect in every sense the opinion of the President, not only from the dignity of his person, but chiefly from my want of authority to combat that opinion. I must also represent to you that I am not authorized to give any kind of interpretation to the articles of the Treaty: that I must confine myself to the literal context of them, and to that of the orders received by my Superior for their fulfilment; and lastly that neither is it my province to judge or to investigate the interpretation given or wished to be given by the President to the 7"" article (of which you call my attention to the liberal constructions allowed of it by him.) nor to determine what the articles are, that are to be transported, or whether the above mentioned constructions ought to be put into the balance with those which you wish me to admit in the 2"" article, as all these questions are directly foreign to the powers in my trust. I must therefore beg leave to state as follows. On the 9"" instant, I received orders from the Captain General of Cuba, commissioning me to make the necessary preparations for the evacuation of this Province by the Troops of His Catholic Majesty, in the space intervening between the day of receipt of his orders and the 22"" August next or sooner if possible, and commissioning me also to arrange the Transportation of the Troops, Artillery, Munitions, &c 60 For the observance and accomplishment of this injunction, His Excellency transmits to me therewith a copy of the Treaty, and another of the Royal Letters Patent for the execution of the same,"" according to its tenor and the stipulations it contains. In the second article of said Treaty, (amongst other things which I omit as not relating to the present case.) is the following clause: â€œHis Catholic Majesty, cedes to the United States, in all property and Sovereignty, the public Edifices, Fortifications and barracks. Now a public edifice is one devoted exclusively to National uses, such as Quarters, Hospitals, Magazines, &""â€”It is evident that the building thus appropriated constitutes the edifice, and that the moveable furniture, which may be placed within it at the owners option, forms no part. He may remove them tomorrow, substitute different ones of equal, greater, or less number, or value; suiting the destination of the building, or with a totally distinct object. Consequently the effects within or without the Edifices are not comprehended under the conclusive and genuine term Edifices, as used in the 2"" article. It is likewise manifest that in this article and with relation to the words specified, it is not said: I cede with them or with the Fortifications the moveables, Artillery, and Munitions, which may or ought to be destined to the same use that the buildings are, amounting to such a number, or in general, or such as they stand at this day, or at the day of their delivery. It may also be said that it is an axiom admitted in society, that previous to the formation of contracts of all kinds having for their object a sale, a cession, or a transfer, a clear and specific mention is necessarily made of all that is sold ceded or transferred to another. A Fortification is nothing but an Edifice to which that name is given, and consequently follows strictly the rule above mentioned; the Artillery, Munitions, provisions, iron-work, arms, and other contents, being the moveables contained in the Edifice, which does not cease, when they are removed to be a Fortification. The number of pieces of Ordnance at present in West Florida, and the proportion which they bear to its size shew, that they never could all have belonged nor have been necessary to its trifling and feeble Fortificationsâ€”another circumstance demonstrative in my opinion that Spain had no intention of ceding them to the United States in the 2"" article, since the indispensable mention would otherwise have been made of them. The inference from the above indisputable points is further confirmed by the concluding clause of the Royal cedula referred to, sent by His Catholic Majesty to the Captain General of the Havana; for (amongst other things which I omit as foreign to the present question) it runs thus, * Dated Oct. 24, 1820, printed ibid., p. 742.  â€œyou will prepare for the delivery of the public Edifices, Fortifications, and barracks, and of all the other effects which may belong to the Nation, and are not found comprehended and mentioned in the expressed clauses of the cession you will cause them to be transported to another point of the Spanish possessions, more convenient to the public Service. The preliminaries being now settled and this reply being reduced to the conclusion to which they lead, if Your Excellency will do me the honour, for the sake of the amity and harmony which reigns between us to put yourself into the place I occupy and the duties I have to discharge, you cannot do less than acknowledge that I ought not, and consequently cannot make you a delivery with the Fortifications of the whole or a part of the Artillery, Munitions, and other articles in this department, to pass with them into the property and under the Sovereignty of the United States. My warmest wishes have for their single object the good harmony and amity which exist between our respective Governments, and which I desire may reign between us; and I therefore incline to the determination that Your Excellency, (considering the opinion entertained by the President) should represent this difficulty to him, as soon as you have time, as I consider that with His Catholic Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington, he may so arrange the matter as to extricate us both from our embarrassing Situation: in the meantime it appears to me a necessary as well as a warrantable step to place the Artillery of the Forts with all the effects appertaining to them under the safeguard of Your Excellency and the Officers and Troops of the United States after having the proper inventories taken. A Severe and sudden indisposition prevents my entering for the present moment into farther particulars, of which I will treat with Your Excellency with the first relief that I experience.â€ God preserve Your Excellency many Years.

SIR, Your communication of this date"" was not received until after I had made arrangements for leaving Pensacola early tomorrow morning to rejoin General Jackson pursuant to a previous understanding with him. It is possible from an imperfect interpretation of our conversation this evening"" we may not distinctly have understood each other; and it may be prudent to commit it to writing what was said as intended and understood by me. I made you under authority from Gen' Jackson but one proposition, which was for an immediate delivery on your part of the Province of West Florida to General Jackson, retiring with your Military force to any convenient point which might be agreed upon, until the necessary preparatory arrangements &"" could be consumated for the embarkation of the Spanish Troops. This was suggested under a belief that such a measure might be a relief to Your Excellency; and prove mutually agreeable to both parties. Of your supposed rejection of this proposition I shall, as you request make no official communication to Gen' Jackson, but leave it to be noticed by you at any convenient or subsequent period. The substance of my conversation otherwise was not by way of propositions for your assent-General Jackson in his communication to you presented through me, had expressed a wish that a period, and place might be concluded upon for a personal interview, when you might exhibit credentials, officially recognize each other, and be prepared to discharge the complicated duties of your respective commissions. The period and place for this purpose, you was willing, if I distinctly understood you, to be designated by General Jackson-His repairing therefore as early as convenient to Pensacola, with a small guard and encamping the American Troops in its vicinity was considered by me as one of those preliminary measures necessarily connected with the preparations to be made for receiving the Province of West Florida, as well as for occupying the Military Post as soon as evacuated; and not exposed to any objection on your partâ€”General Jackson's intention therefore was only accidentally mentioned as it was both proper and decorous to advise you of it. The American Troops are dependant upon the supply of Provisions now in Pensacola and their encamping nearer that City than at present, is with a view to their convenience and with no disposition to permit them to come into collision with the Spanish Troopsâ€”Such an event is not anticipated and shall be prohibited.

After duly examining the documents you were pleased to have me furnished with, in relation to the Stores, Artillery &c.; and after a careful examination of my instructions touching those points, I find that I cannot meet your proposition. While I sincerely regret the difficulties, which we are from our respective instructions placed in, I feel extremely desirous, to place the subject happily at rest between us. And therefore respectfully propose the following arrangement, in addition to that given in my note of the 15"" which is, that you will consent to leave all the Artillery, with their implements, and a proportion of ammunition &c, for which I will give a corresponding receipt, placing the proper construction of the treaty, in the hands of our respective governments. And to facilitate as much as possible the contemplated exchange, I will engage to furnish transportation for the ammunition and stores, save that of the Cannon balls, bombs, and grape shot, which you can have transported. And in like manner, the transportation furnished on my part, as well as the provisions consumed on the voyage, and the amunition which may be left with me, shall be subject to a similar adjustment, on the part of our respective governments. Should your instruction, in conjunction with your sound judgment authorize you to adopt this proposition, I shall be more than pleased, as I am constrained from a sense of duty to say, that it is the only arrangement on this subject which I feel at liberty to enter into. But should your views not correspond with mine, whilst I regret the circumstance, I must refer you to the sentiments of my former note, in which is embodied my protest, for your final decision thereon. It is now proper that I should inform your Excellency that the United States is prepared with escort, transport, provisions and water, to accomodate the Spanish officers and Troops to the Havana, and that I am prepared to enter immediately into the general arrangement for the reception of the province which you have been selected by your Government to deliver.

I need not urge upon your Excellency how desirable it is that the contemplated exchange, should be speedily effected, as well on account of the situation of the troops laying off this City, as the accumulating expence daily arising from our state of preparation under the treaty.

The points mentioned in your letter of today are, I am now fully persuaded, the same which my interpreter wished to make me comprehend; but I remained so much in doubt as to what was the positive object to which they related, and whether the true sense had been given to my replies, that as a proof of confidence and friendship I requested for our better understanding that you would set them down in writing and suspend your judgement. The particular mode of correspondence never was nor could be, nor is, considered by me as an essential point in our official communication on the above particulars, relatively to the said points, consistently with His Excellency Genl Jackson's intimation in his communication giving you authority; this subject therefore although discussed on paper is susceptible of no other understanding than that which might be given it by word of mouth. I am particularly sorry that my note did not come to hand as soon as I wished; but I can assure you that not eight minutes had elapsed after you left my house, until I despatched my Secretary with it, and the delay in its receipt on your part proceeded from my Secretary not meeting with you in the places where he first directed his search.

Forbes. Call replied that the Captain of the Hornet had assured him that a United States Schooner had sailed from the Havana for East Florida, to which he had given in charge the Commission of conveying the Packet containing the Captain General's orders for its delivery; and although I insisted that Alva's going thither would not be superfluous, as some unforeseen accident might befal that despatch. The vessels set sail several days after, and neither Alva nor Forbes have taken any measure on the subject, that I could learn. I required Alva, yesterday, to give me an account of his proceedings with Forbes in relation to the aid which it was proposed at the Havana, * Enclosed in Jackson to the Secretary of State, post, p. 137.  the latter should give him, what arrangements Forbes had made, and how it was, he was remaining wholly inactive here.

It is incomprehensible what a medley the absurdities and visionary projects of Alva and Forbes form; they live together and can alone understand each other; but this much is certain, that the Package is here, and I am at this moment perplexed by the uncertainty of its being or not being in default at St Augustine, and apprehensive of the prejudice which both Nations may sustain, if by mishap the former should be the case. I entreat Your Excellency, therefore, to have the goodness, in consideration of the foregoing, to let me know, if you have any intelligence of the Orders being actually or probably in St Augustine, and in the contrary case, if Your Excellency thinks the transmission of this Package necessary, what means are at your command for carrying it into effect, or to what other mode of proceeding recourse is to be had.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, v:C*",Correspondence,ROBERT BUTLER TO GOVERNOR COPPINGER,ROBERT BUTLER,GOVERNOR COPPINGER,"SIR. Before answering the particulars of your note of yesterday,â€ I beg leave to inform you that I have given to Major Cross and Lieut Baird the necessary orders as contemplated in your letter of the 19* and they will wait on your Excellency accordingly. In answering that part of your note aforesaid which relates to the Archives or records of individual property, I take for granted that we understood each other in that respect, fully in our conference yesterday, and will remark accordingly, that as there appears some doubts on your part, you are desirous to await the decision of the Cap' Gen' of Cuba on the subject, at the same time you are disposed to give me an official assurance that they shall not be removed from the province until such decision is received. Your motives cannot be otherwise than approved on my part, and as the Adeline Schooner will return to this port from the Havana, a favorable opportunity offers for the conveyance of the Cap' Gen' answer. You will permit me to hope that you will embody my sentiments as expressed to you on that subject in your letter to the Cap"" Gen' as I deem it of the utmost importance for the security of the titles to the property owned by the inhabitants of this province, that the only evidence (which is the records) that will be recognized by my government should remain a permanent basis of security to them in their posession. I will now take up the subject of your Excellencys note of yesterdayâ€”and will inform you that the Sloop Endeavor of 40 tons has been procured for the purpose of affording additional accomodations to the families of the officers, and also to transport the ammunition and stores contemplated by our mutual understanding, and which I have deemed sufficient from the official estimate furnished me by your aid de Camp, and which I had the honor at your request, to send you yesterday for examination. The Cap' of this vessel will be instructed to report to you early on tomorrow and take your orders. Enclosed your Excâ€ will find an estimate of the provisions to be furnished on my part embracing also their kinds and component parts, which will afford you the information desired. You will also receive a memoranda of the accomodations afforded by the transports,"" and I am persuaded that you will discover the propiety of placing the military officers who have families on board the Meteor, as the accomodations are entirely private, each stateroom having a Venitian door, and unconnected with each other. The Cabin accomodations of the Sloop also afford much convenience, as you will readily perceive. As you were pleased to express yourself satisfied with these accomodations in our conversation yesterday I shall be gratified to know that you continue so. It may be of some importance to the officer commanding the U.S. convoy to have completed at an early day the arrangements necessary for the government of the fleet. I hope you will afford the information on that head as soon as possible. After expressing my thanks for the exertions you are daily making to facilitate my wishes, I conclude with a hope that you will make a request of the Cap"" Gen' that the transports shall enter Havana, and disembark free of duties.

The President has been disposed to make every allowance for the dilatory character of all transactions habitual to the officers of the Spanish Government. On receiving your Letter of the 19. May; he had thought it would be necessary to take measures on a presumption that the unwaritable delays of the Governor of Cuba would be still continued; which under other circumstances it would be very desirable to avoidâ€”While these measures however were under consideration, intillegence was received from Col.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, v1:LS *",Correspondence,GOVERNOR JACKSON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,GOVERNOR JACKSON,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR I seize the first moment of leisure I have been able to obtain for more than a month, to lay before you an account of the commission confided to me in relation to the Floridas, and also the measures adopted for their Government until the will of the President be known. In my letters from Blakeley of the 1** and 7"" of May,â€ duplicates of which with accompanying documents have been forwarded, I informed you of my arrival at that place, of my disappointment in not hearing from the Hornet of my despatching Mess"" Brackenridge and Bronaugh with a letter to Governor Callava, and of my communication with Montpelier. I had with confidence calculated on the arrival of the Hornet by the first of May, and from a knowledge of the habitual apathy of Spanish functionaries, I thought it advisable even before the arrival of the Hornet, to announce my commission to the Spanish Governor of West Florida, and after offering to exhibit the royal order and my commission for receiving the country, to ask information upon certain points, which would tend to expedite and facilitate subsequent arrangements. From his letter which has also been forwarded it will be seen that he declined to comply with my request; but I am well satisfied that this early step had a favorable operation upon our subsequent transactions. It drew from him, a promise that the surrender of the Country should not be delayed by him, in case he should be the person commissioned for the purpose, and I think it not improbable, that this measure had also some effect with the Captain General of Cuba. I had rec"" intimations both at New Orleans, and at Blakeley, that speculations were in contemplation, to accomplish which, great pains would be taken by the parties concerned to delay the surrender of the ceded Country, and since that period I have heard it frequently expressed as a matter of surprise that no attempt of the kind had been made, at least in this quarter. On the return of Mess"" Bronaugh and Brackenridge I proceeded to Montpelier having been previously joined by my Aid de Camp Cap' Call. On the 11"" I again addressed a letter to the Governor of West Florida"" which I despatched by Capt. Call who was instructed to remain at Pensacola until the arrival of the Hornet, for I still confidently hoped this could not be delayed many days, and also authorised Cap"" Call to make any preliminary arrangements with the Governor, which he would be willing to enter into. In my letter to him of the 11"" after expressing my regret at his not considering himself authorised to give the information I had asked, I informed him that orders had been given to provide transportation for six hundred men with supplies for their voyage, that the same was then ready, and would sail for Pensacola on the first notification of the receipt of the Royal Order at that place. In doing this my intention was to deprive him of all excuse on the score of his not having had sufficient time to make his preparations for quitting the Country. I had previously informed him of the assurances of the Spanish Minister at Washington, that no delay should be experienced in the surrender of the Floridas, and which I now took occasion to repeat. After stating the unpleasant situation in which the American Troops were placed in the interior, I proceeded to inform him that two public vessels the Shields and the Amelia were then at anchor in Mobile Bay with supplies for Pensacola and St. Marks, and proposed to make a deposit of the supplies intended for our Troops at the former place, and also requested to be informed whether it would meet his wishes to have the Troops of Spain brought from St. Marks to Pensacola, as a preparatory measure to the surrender of the Country, so that all the Spanish officers and Soldiers might sail together under the same convoy. This was intended to render the evacuation more convenient and agreeable to them. I had began to entertain serious doubts of the speedy arrival of the Hornet, and thought that if a preliminary arrangement of this kind could be made, time might be saved. The Governor in his reply of the 16** consented to the proposal of making a deposit of the provisions for the American Troops, approved of the proposal respecting the transportation of the Troops from St. Marks, but denied that he had any power to make any preliminary arrangement or do any act connected with the surrender of the Country until he should have received orders from his superior. The vessels accordingly sailed for Pensacola, and the provisions were placed in deposit at that place. It may be well here to observe, that at a subsequent period, the Governor thought proper to claim the benefit of the proposal to bring the Spanish Troops to this place from St. Marks, although not assented to when made, and was acceded to by me from a wish to deal with him in the most liberal and generous manner, at the same time that I was determined to permit no idle and useless delay. Nearly two weeks elapsed after the departure of Cap"" Call, without hearing a word of the Hornet. The anxiety which I experienced can be more readily imagined than expressed. Without speaking of my own situation, and that of my family which was extremely uncomfortable, I began to entertain serious apprehensions that there was no intention to surrender the country before the 22"" of August. During this painful state of suspence, many rumors were afloat and how far, well or ill founded, it was impossible for me to say. I was utterly unable to conjecture the cause of the delay of Col: Forbes, it appeared to me that a few days would have sufficed for the transmission of the Royal Order to the Floridas, and I took it for granted that if any considerable delay was likely to be experienced in procuring the archives, a person could be left to receive them, in order to accomplish the more important object of obtaining immediate possession of the ceded territories. On an attentive examination of the stipulations of the Treaty, I was satisfied in my own mind that the seventh Article relating to the transportation of the Spanish officers and Troops, and the evacuation of the places occupied by them, was a different matter from the surrender of the sovereignty of the Country, as stipulated under the Second Article of the Treaty, and for which no specific time was appointed, and therefore to date from the exchange of ratifications. This construction was confirmed by the stipulations on the subject of duties, by which the twelve years privilege granted to Spain was to commence three months after the ratification; and the provision which under a construction different from that I had given would have been entirely unnecessary, that the duties collected by the Spanish Custom-house Officers from the time of the exchange of ratifications until the surrender, might be retained. The circumstances attending the Treaty, although not appearing on the face of it, I was satisfied ought in good conscience and in truth, to place the date of its ratification on the part of Spain as far back as October last. These wise considerations which I kept in reserve to be acted on only in case of the most urgent necessity, having set out with a determination to carry the Treaty into effect if possible in harmony and good will. I was also determined on the arrival of the Royal Order, to permit no useless delay, as I conceived that after this, the termination of the business was left to Governor Callava and myself, our respective Governments having confided it to us, and I was determined that on such event, nothing should be wanting on my part. On the 20""Cap"" Callâ€ returned to Montpelier in company with M Thompson * who brought me the first certain information of the Hornet. M Thompson was the bearer of a letter from Col: Forbesâ€ to which I refer you, which, although far from being satisfactory, together with the assurances of M Thompson that the Hornet would probably have sailed in a few days after his departure from Havanna, served in some measure to remove the uneasiness I had experienced. I began to entertain a hope that the long expected vessel might at last arrive. In anticipation of this event I addressed a letter to Col: Gadsden who had shortly before reached Pensacola, and appointed him a confidential agent to reside at that place, and for the purposes expressed in my letter to him of the 21"" of May to which I refer you.â€ Having occason for the services of Col: Gadsden near me, I transfered his powers to Capt. Call, and was joined by the former at Montpelier. On the 22"" I addressed a letter to Major Fanning the officer commanding at Fort Gadsden,â€ giving the necessary orders for the taking possession and occupation of St. Marks, to which I must also refer you as more fully explanatory of the arrangements made with a view to that operation. From this period until I addressed you my letter of the 30"" of May * I remained at Montpelier in the same uncertainty and with increasing solicitude. Reports reached me that Cap"" Reed of the Hornet had fallen a victim to the climate of Havanna, and that the greater part of the crew was unfit for duty. My letter of the ninth of June * will shew the painful anxiety which I felt during this period, not a little heightened by the bad state of my health. I prepared in the mean time, an express to be despatched to St. Augustine with instructions to Col: Butler, and wrote him the letter under date of the 2"" of June "" to give him the earliest information of events in this quarterâ€”I was apprehensive that the vessels employed to transport the Troops from East Florida would have arrived, and occasion a heavy demurrage, as the same precautions could not well be taken there, as in this quarter, where we were more convenient to the place at which the transports were to be procured. I had almost given up all hope of the arrival of the Hornet, when at last I was informed by express that she had arrived at Pensacola on the evening of the 9"" of June after having been detained six weeks in Havanna for reasons which to me still remain unaccounted for. A letter from Col: Forbes "" was brought by the same express informing me of his arrival at Pensacola in company with Don Alba as commissioner on the part of Spain. I refer you to this letter and to my reply dated the eleventh.â€ I could not but remark with some surprise that the Order of the Cap"" General was for the delivery of West Florida to Col: Forbes as commissioner on the part of the United States, this was owing to a mistake Col: Forbes informs me,â€ which, although discovered before the sailing of the Hornet, could not be corrected for want of time. The length of time which elapsed from the date of the Order and the sailing of the Hornet, is a circumstance which I must confess I do not clearly understand. It is by no means accounted for, by the delay in procuring the archives; all that could be procured, was a few extracts from the Treaty of '83 between Spain and Great Britain, and which I presume is to be had in any common library. The important papers relating to the grants of Land in this Country, as well as other documents directly relating to the Floridas must still be the subject of negotiation between the respective Governments. I forbear to make any further remark on this head but will refer you to my letter of the 11** sent by Express after my former letter had gone,"" and also to the communications of Col: Forbes himself. Without loss of time I addressed the letter of the 12â€ to Governor Callava,"" having previously received his communication of the 10** brought to me by Cap"" Call. I expressed my gratification at the promptitude with which he had imparted to me the information he had promised on the arrival of the Hornet, and was pleased with his frankness in waving any advantage of the Order being for the surrender of the Country to M. Forbes. To meet what appeared liberal, with equal liberality, I assented to his request that the Spanish Troops should be brought from St. Marks to be embarked with those at this place. Cap"" Call who had been authorised to make the arrangement for the evacuation of Sâ€™ Marks had been met by the difficulty antici- pated by you in relation to the construction of the Treaty. The Spanish Governor required a receipt for the cannon and munitions of War left at St. Marks, contending that the former was not included under the term fortification. To his proposal I acceded according to the terms expressed in my letter of the 12* in which I urged all the arguments which then suggested themselves to me to prove the right of the United States under the Second Article of the Treaty. I also brought into view the manner in which the 7"" Article was expressed and the liberal construction placed upon it by the President under a belief that a construction equally liberal would be placed by Spain on the one before mentioned; and finally refered him to Captain Call to whom I had given in my letter of the same date * authority to make a provisional arrangement in case the Governor after the reasons I had given should persist in his construction of the Treaty; this was to receipt for the Cannon on the Forts on condition that receipts should also be given for the transportation furnished for Civil Officers, Servants &c. and provisions, not provided for by the express letter of the 7*Article. Giving it, at the same time to be distinctly understood that the United States should by no act of mine be considered as abandoning their right to the Cannon as part of the appendages of the Forts. An inventory of the munitions of War, embraced in their claim was to be taken, and the receipt to specify that they had been received with the Forts, but claimed by the Spanish commissioner as not included in the cession, and to be held by the American agents, subject to any future disposition which might be made by the respective Governments; The Spanish Commissioner to receipt for provisions, transportation of families of Officers, Civil Officers &c. in the same form and the Governor distinctly informed that in case the Spanish Government insisted upon the delivery of the one the U. States would insist upon payment for the other. Capt. Call was also instructed in case this proposed arrangement, should not prove satisfactory, to refuse transportion for every thing not literally included in the 7* Article of the Treaty, and at the same time to protest against the dismantling the Forts, as an act on the Governors own responsibility, and as a violation of the Second Article of the Treaty. As an evidence of my desire to settle the business in the most satisfactory and amicable manner, Cap"" Call was instructed to comply with the Governors request for transportation of two Field-pieces from St. Marks and some ordinance Stores. In the same letter I informed the Governor of my intention to move in a few days into the vicinity of Pensacola. I also gave him to understand that the Transports deemed necessary had been provided and might shortly be expected in Pensacola. On the 16"" of June after an unpleasant journey on account of the unusual rains which had prevailed for a considerable time, I arrived at the House of Manuel Gonzales distant fifteen miles from Pensacola, where I intended to await the arrival of the Troops and to remain until I had officially announced to the Governor my entrance into the Floridas for the purpose of receiving possession, as Commissioner on the part of the United States. On the day of my arrival at Manuels I wrote to the Governor * by Col: Gadsden informing him of my arrival at that place, prepared to accomplish the object of my commission. I expressed a wish that a period as early as possible might be concluded on to our mutual convenience when we might meet, exhibit our credentials, officially recognize each other and enter on the duties of our respective Commissions. I stated that Col: Gadsden was authorised by me to take charge of any communications from him and to concert the arrangements connected with the proposition made. On the same evening I received a long letter dated of that day, from the Governor,â€ in answer to mine, on the subject of the construction of the Treaty, with a few lines on the envelope, informing me, that but for his ill state of health he would have done himself the pleasure of waiting on me in person. My reply dated the 17** contains a brief refutation of his reasoning, and an expression of my unwilliness to induce him to depart from the positive instructions which he informed me he had received. I concluded by observing that when I should have the pleasure of seeing him personally, I should hope to make an arrangement agreeably to the instructions given to Cap"" Call, and which he had communicated to him, and which will refer the subjects of difference to be adjusted by our respective Governments. The situation of the Troops now encamped near Manuals was inconvenient on account of the distance from their supplies. There were many reasons strongly requiring that the American Flag should be hoisted in Pensacola without delay; American vessels were arriving and were expected to arrive which had sailed from Ports of the U. States under the faith of the expected surrender, and which would be exposed to the payment of heavy duties through the means of an arbitrary valuation; there had been a great increase of American population and which was augmenting every day, and the state of things incident to a country so nearly on the point of being transferred forever to the dominion of a nother Nation may be readily conceived: added to all this, the neglect of the police which I was informed existed in Pensacola, and attention to which is so important to a place that must be indebted to this circumstance perhaps more than to any other, for its future growth. Under all these circumstances I authorised Col: Gadsden to make the proposition mentioned in his letter of the 18** in the hope that it might possibly meet the approbation of Governor Callava, but without intending to insist upon it. From the other part of Col: Gadsdens letter it will be seen that it was my wish, a time and place might be designated at which we might meet, recognize each other and enter on the business of our respective Commissions. A misapprehension occured on this subject which was not explained until the close of our correspondence. Not receiving such an invitation as I thought I had a right to expect, and not being visited by the Governor or any of his Officers, I concluded to remain with my family where I was, and as the Governor had officially recognized me as commissioner, I resolved to carry on the preparatory negotiation by means of my Staff. I received another letter from the Governor on the 19* * together with his letter to Col: Gadsden.â€ I refer you to my reply of the day following * in which I enter into a full and explicit statement of what I conceived to have been misunderstood. In the course of that communication after enumerating some of the more urgent reasons on my part for obtaining a speedy delivery of West Florida, I requested him to state in how many days after the arrival of the Troops from St. Marks he would be prepared to evacuate the Floridas. Imentioned the circumstance of one of the Transports the Anna Maria having arrived some time before, the Cora having unfortunately been cast away near the Balize, but that prompt measures had been taken to remedy the misfortune. In the same communication I informed the Governor of the appointment of Major Stanton to discharge the duties attendant on the transportation of the Spanish Troops and to concert the necessary measures for their comfort. In the concluding observations of my letter I regretted the existing difference respecting the construction of any Articles of the Treaty, the stipulations of which we were in part commissioned to execute. I received on the 22nd the Governors letter of that date * together with the one of the 20"" "" enclosing several propositions relating to preliminary arrangements for the surrender of the Country and the Fortifications of Barrancas. In the letter of the 22"" he informed me that Don Alba was merely the bearer of despatches from the Captain General, and clothed with no official character, in relation to the Floridas, and declared himself to be the Commissioner. He waved the exhibition of my commission for the present, but requested an attested copy, which was accordingly sent. In reply to my request of appointing a day after the arrival of the Troops from St. Marks for the delivery of West Florida, he stated that as soon as the Garrison of Appalache should reach Pensacola, and the transports should be ready, he considered four or six days at the utmost as sufficient for the delivery of it, the embarkation of the equipage, Troops and other individuals; whence he declared that I might now consider the time solicited by me to be fixed. The subject of the Artillery was again touched upon in his letter, when I had flattered myself with a hope that it had been well understood and settled. The Artillery and its appendages he informed me could not be submitted to any kind of compromise, such at least was the meaning given to the Spanish expressions, no puedo yo sugetarlo Ã  ningun clase de compromiso. Not a little surprised at what appeared to me little short of equivocation; on the receipt of it, I experienced no small degree of mortification. I called upon Cap' Call for his report, whether he had not communicated to Governor Callava, my Instructions given him in relation to this subject, and immediately upon receiving his report, to which I beg leave to refer you,â€ I addressed Governor Callava my communication of the 23* * in which I deemed it necessary to recapitulate what I had said on the subject of the construction of the second and Seventh Articles of the Treaty, and in order to prevent any future misunderstanding I reduced the subject to thisâ€”two distinct propositions. 1st. That an Inventory of the Cannon, munitions of War &c. &c. belonging to the Fortifications ceded should be taken and signed by the proper Officers authorised to do so, with a remark that said Cannon, ordinance &c. were claimed by him but left in my possession, subject to any future disposition which might be made of them by our respective Governments. 2nd. That an Inventory of the transportation of families of Officers and Servants, and provisions placed on board of the Transports for the supply of the Troops on their voyage should be made out and certified by you as furnished by me. I observed that these were the propositions to which I had supposed he had assented, and that they corresponded with the instructions given to Cap"" Call. I had now hoped the subject was understood and at rest. In the Governors reply of the 25*"" he acknowledges himself to be well acquainted with the tenor of the particulars which it embraces, and particularly with that part which relates to the Artillery, he declares that no mistake could have occurred in the account given by him to the Minister of his Catholick Majesty at Washington, and in the concluding part of his letter he observes that no objection, or remark, offers itself to giving me a certificate setting forth the number of persons transported, and of the provisions supplied them for their voyage. A Short correspondence to which I refer you, had at the same time taken place respecting the transmission to St. Augustine of the necessary Orders for the delivery of that place. I refer you also to my letter to Col: Forbes"" and his reply.â€ The length to which this communication has already been unavoidably drawn out precludes me from making any remarks at present on this business. The circumstance however added to the necessity of despatching Col: Gadsden to St. Augustine, and preparatory to this I prepared the letter to Col: Butler,â€ the Commission to Mr Worthington * and letter to that Gentleman,"" with other documents referred to, and of which I gave an account in my letter to you of the 29"" of June * In that letter you will perceive my understanding respecting the provisional arrangement on the subject of the disputed Articles of the Treaty clearly and fully expressed. I refer you to the correspondence between the Governor and myself previous to that date and after the 25* This tedious length of correspondence in settling so many matters of detail, as well as of greater importance, was what I had not expected, and in the then state of my health, was extremely fatiguing. In my letter of the 26"" "" I expressed my satisfaction that we had not misunderstood each other on the subject of the Artillery &c. &c. By good fortune, when much at a loss for a mode of conveyance for Col: Gadsden, the extraordinary rains having rendered the passage across the Country almost impracticable, the U. States Schooner Revenge entered this Port and was instantly put in requisition for the service above mentioned. M. Forbes, and Don Alba, or rather the Governor in his behalf solicited a passage, but on being informed that the vessel was extremely small, having, but one birth, which the Commander had given up to Col: Gadsden I could not consent: Col: Forbes however, embarked without my consent, knowledge or approbation. I refer you to my letters of the 1"" of July * for several preliminary arrangements proposed and acceded to respecting the preparation of the Process Verbal, the ceremony to be observed in changing the Flag,"" and the appointment of Mess"" Call Bronaugh and Brackenridge to unite with the like number of persons to be appointed by the Governor to examine and compare the Inventories of Archives, and Public buildings & Property."" Major Stanton had been appointed for the same service in relation to the artillery and the taking of the Inventory and receipt for the provisions and transportation of Civil Officers &c. &c. By letter of the 3"" of July ""I communicated to the Governor the arrival of Ship â€œLucy ann,â€ chartered in the room of the â€œCora.â€ I intimated that I hoped no delay would occur on the arrival of the Vessels from St. Marks, or the embarkation of the Spanish Troops &c. on board the transports then ready and the surrender of the Country, that the vessels were under a heavy demurrage, and that I relied on his pledge that no unnecessary delay would be permitted on the arrival of the Transports. The accident of the loss of the Cora, and the unusual detention of the vessels from St. Marks, by contrary winds, had already given the Governor much longer time than he could possibly have calculated on, when he gave me the pledge already mentioned. Every day which now passed was so much gained on the other side, and a heavy expence to the United States. Instead of three or four days the usual voyage from St. Marks to this place, the vessels were detained by adverse winds thirteen days, and at length arrived at Pensacola on the morning of the 9"" of July. This event I communicated without loss of time to the Governor by my letter of the 9* * and requested him to appoint a day for the delivery of West Florida with the Fortress of St. Marks according to the agreement previously entered into between us. I had been unremitted in my endeavors, as I think will fully appear by the correspondence, to leave nothing unsettled on the arrival of the vessels from St. Marks so as to permit no possible excuse for delay, as the Hornet had been here a month already owing to the unlooked for loss of the Cora and the extraordinary prevalence of Westerly Winds, which prevented the arrival of the vessels just mentioned. For my correspondence with Major Fanning "" I also refer to the accompanying documents. I also send you a copy of the orders issued by me to Col: Brooke ""preparatory to the march of the Troops to Galvez Spring. My intention of moving to some convenient spot near Pensacola immediately before taking possession of West Florida had already been intimated to the Governor and assented to. In answer to my request the Governor in his letter of the tenth ""informed me that on the day following he would name a day in conformity with his pledge. But on the day following, to my astonishment he informed me by his letter of the 11"" "" that on Saturday the 14"" he would inform me whether the surrender should be made on the Monday or Tuesday following: both of these days beyond the latest period fixed upon for the delivery. I confess I could not but feel considerable irritation, for it seemed to me that if I permitted him to disregard his pledge at will in one particular, there was no knowing what was next to follow. I was disappointed in what I had confidently expected, and under these feelings addressed him my letter of the 12* of July.â€ The Troops had marched the day before to Galvez Spring, and were on that day joined by me at that place. To the Governors letter of the 13"" "" and my reply of the same date ""I must beg leave to refer you. I sincerely regretted the unpleasant feeling occasioned by the circumstance I have detailed, but I acted under a sense of duty and a firm conviction of the necessity of the course pursued. The Governor fixed upon the 17* as the day for the delivery, unequivocally and without reserve, and in my letter of that date I advised you"" of my having obtained possession of West Florida. I had reposed in the utmost confidence after the friendly and satisfactory manner in which the delivery was made on the 17* that the business was finally closed in the way I could have desired. But in this, I regret to say; I have been disappointed. On the day just mentioned, all papers, Inventories &c. were duly prepared for signature on either side, excepting the Inventory & receipt for provisions &c. not expressly stipulated for under the 7"" Article of the Treaty. On the morning of the 17* Major Stanton informed me that he had been waited on by M. Cruzat the Governors Secretary, who on the part of the Governor, stated, that from ill health, and press of business, he was not able to attend to the Inventory at that time, and requesting that it might be deferred, pledging himself that it should be made out in conformity with the agreement, and satisfactory to me. When this request was reported to me, I confess I was not a little surprised, and in spite of the high opinion which my Officers entertained of Governor Callava, and my own sincere wish to cherish the same opin- ion, the recollection of the conduct we have on so many occasions experienced from Spanish functionaries, and particularly the conduct of Governor Folk"" towards Mess"" Ellicotâ€ and Hawkins; * rendered it impossible for me entirely to divest my mind of distrust. I had constantly cautioned those under my orders to be on their guard, and on this occasion I observed to M Stanton, who it will be seen by the accompanying documents had been fully instructed on the subject, that if he could place confidence in the promises of the Governor and his Secretary I had no objection to the indulgence. After the Governor was restored to better health and walking about the Town, I urged Major Stanton to obtain the Inventory and receipt, in order that I might close my communication to the Government. After a delay of some days a receipt was presented to me, which on being translated, I found with indignation, to be a simple acknowledgement that the transportation and provisions had been furnished by the U. States in compliance with the stipulations of the 7"" Article of the Treaty. I immediately informed Major Stanton that such a thing could not be received, and ordered him to call on Mr. Cruzat and procure the kind of receipt agreed upon in our correspondence, and which he had pledged himself should be given. After a lapse of ten days, the note to Major Stanton from M'Cruzat was presented to me,â€ in which I am informed that no other receipt than the one which the Governor choose to offer would be given. I immediately appointed Doctor Bronaugh to wait on Governor Callava in company with Major Stanton and demand a receipt in strict & literal conformity with my letter of the 23"" of June * and assented to in his letter of the 25** I refer you to the report of those Gentlemen, by which it will be seen that he utterly refused. I then addressed him my letter of the 3"" of August * declaring in the most explicit manner that in consequence of his faithless conduct the receipt given by me for the Artillery is null and void, and that I should so report it to my Government, the execution of the one, being the consideration of the other. The conduct of Governor Callava has mortified me exceedingly, especially as I had wished to think well of him, and as he had been u",,,,,,,

Barracks: A building situated to the east of the Government House; and a short distance from the same: One hundred fifty six and a half feet long, by forty six and a half feet wideâ€”three stories in highthâ€”the basement story of Brick with floors of the sameâ€”the others of woodâ€”the whole much dilapidated. The doors and windows have been destroyed. The Galleries which formerly surrounded the edifice have entirely disappeared. The roofs in several places is decayed and fallen inâ€”The projection of the roof deprived of the support of the timbers of the galleries is on one side hanging in broken fragments. The roof and floor timbers much decayed. The weather boards in some places together with the plastering of the interior have been torn off; and the whole of the appartments exposed to the injuries of the weather; and in a most filthy condition- It is extremely difficult, if not impossible to ascertain the sum that would be required to put this building in a state of complete repair; but from what I can learn of the price of materials and labour, it cannot be done; in my opinion for less than eight thousand dollars, unless the public Artificers and labourers from the troops were employed in procuring the necessary materials; and in effecting the work: In which case the expense would be comparitively smallâ€” The Government House. Twenty nine feet by eighteen of three stories. The Basement story of brick, the others of wood slightly built (surrounded by broad Piazzas) but in decent repair; and affords convenient quarters for most of the officers of the Garrison. The Mess House and Kitchen situated near the Government House, is also in decent repair The Stables out of repair The buildings which constitute the Hospital are four in number, situated on the corner of [blank] Street adjoining the lot occupied by JosÃ© Rockâ€”one forty eight feet by thirty six, another forty feet by twenty two, both of wood, indifferently constructedâ€”Two small buildings used as Kitchens also of wood. The labour of a few Artificers for a short time, will be able to effect the necessary repairs on those Buildings Four Block Houses situated on the public place, Thirty feet and a half square, constructed of logs, on brick foundations are, with the exception of one situated near the church, much decayed. Artificers are now employed in effecting such repairs as will render them convenient quarters for the four companies of Infantry composing the Garrison of Pensacola. The expense of doing which, will not be very considerable. The four buildings denominated in the Inventory. Guard Houses contiguous to the Block Houses require considerable repairs. They are to be occupied as Kitchens and company storehousesâ€” * A wooden Building situated on the Bay, and to the east of Tivoli seventy four feet by twenty seven, formerly used as Dragoons quarters, in a decayed state; and not worth repairing.

Worthington, to whom by Co Gadsden on the first instant, I had transmitted a commission clothing him with all the powers heretofore exercised by the Spanish Governor, and fearful that M Worthington might not have arrived, I also sent a blank commission provisionally to be filled in the absence of M' W, in the name of the commanding officer of St Augustine."" I find that this was a wise precaution, as from a letter received from Mr Worthington on yesterday the 26"" July, dated Baltimore 30"" of June,"" it appears that he thinks there cannot be any urgent necessity for his presence in a short time.

Manuscript copies of 1 to 5, transmitted by Jackson to the Sec. of State, July 30, 1821 (ante, p. 137), are in NA (SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, V and VI). A printed copy of 6, transmitted by Jackson on Aug. 26 is loc. cit., VII, and a printed copy of 7, transmittal letter not determined, is ibid. Broadside printed copies of 1 to 4 (in English and Spanish), were transmitted by Worthington to the Sec. of State on Aug. 28 (post, p. 192). Copies of 1 to 5 are in LC (Jackson Papers, Lets. and Orders, Bk. M). In the Pensacola Floridian, Aug. 18, 1821, are printed 1, 2, and 4 in English, and 7 appears in the issue of Sept. 8. A receipt of Oct. 8, 1821, signed by Cary Nicholas and George Tunstall, the publishers of the Floridian, lists the Aug. 25 issue of that newspaper as having contained printings of the ordinances in addition to the above (LC, Jackson Papers, Mil. Papers, XIII, 14). That particular issue is no longer extant. Nos. 1 to 5 of the ordinances were printed in Annals of Congress, 17 Cong., 1 sess., cols. 2547â€”2555, and subsequently reprinted in A. S. P., Misc., II, 904â€“908. The copies transmitted to the House by the Dept. of State are in NA (HF, Orig. Repts., SD and PO, 17 Cong., 1 and 2 sess.). A facsimile reproduction of the broadsides in NA (SD, Fla. Terr. Papers) of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, edited by Douglas C. McMurtrie, was published in Chicago in 1941 by the John Calhoun Club with the title: Ordinances of the Provinces of the Floridas But Relating Specifically to West Florida, as Proclaimed by Major General Andrew Jackson and Printed in Broadside Form at Pensacola in 1821. For discussion of ordinances, See ante, p. 137. presence of the Secretaries of the Floridas at this time, when the Government is first in organization, when all commissions are to be made out and attested, surely their services afterwards can be dispensed withâ€”Let me assure you that the absence of the officers appointed,â€ has given rise to great labour to me, and considerable expense to the Government, for clerks have been employed to do that which should have been done by the Officers duly appointed by you. The information of M Worthington's being in Baltimore, and my uncertainty as to the safe arrival of Co Gadsden at St Augustine, made it therefore necessary to communicate with St Augustine over land, as in the absence of the one (M' W) and should any absenee accident have detained the Co', there is no person there to administer the Government, until the arrival of my express. I this day enclose to M' Adams, Secretary of State, a full report of all my proceedings in taking possession of the Floridas,"" and also as Governor of the same after possession was had, with copies of the ordinances established by me for the Government of the same, which are forwarded for your approval and further instructions. You will find from the report of Judge Brackenridge,"" exercising the office of Alcalde for the city of Pensacola, that I have in the organization kept as close to the letter of my instructions as the situation of the country would permit. The taxes to be laid on tavern licenses, Billiard tables, Retailers of spirits &"" &"", by the city corporation and county Courts, are such as have been laid under the Spanish Government, they being the only source through which the necessary funds can be obtained, to keep the springs, streets and canals of the Town in good repair, by which the health of the city can be preserved. I have endeavoured in my letter to the Secretary of State to explain through him to you, the reasons for introducing every ordinance for the Government of the Floridas, to which I beg leave te refer to you. I should have closed these arduous duties fifteen days since, had it not been for the treacherous and dishonorable conduct of Governor Callava, in whom some of myofficers had incautiously trusted and viewing him as a high minded-military man, in whose pledge of honor they could place implicit reliance, did not for a moment suspect the deception and baseness which they have since experienced. I had entrusted to Major Staunton, Quarter Master, the procurement of the trans- portation and provisions; and of course when Governor Callava claimed the right of taking from the fortifications their means of defence, I claimed an exemption from the cost of provisions & transportation, of civil officers, including the families and servants of both the civil and military officers. The Governor proposed that the Ordnances &"" &""â€”should be inventoried and receipted for, to which I assented, having the Provisions, transportation &"" &"" &"" inventoried and receipted for in the same manner, which was, and well understood, to be agreed to and to be referred to our Governments, as you will see by referring to our correspondence duly reported to M' Adams and to which I refer you. The duty of taking the Inventory and receipt, was enjoined upon Major Staunton, as you will see by my letter of instructions of the 6* July,"" and he had been verbally instructed and urged by me to be particular on this subject, for although my officers had great confidence in Governor Callava, I was too well acquainted with the Spanish character and with the intrigue and duplicity exercised by Govt Foulk with Ellicott and Co Hawkins, to have any: I therefore was particular in urging all concerned to beware, and do their duty carefully. At length the 17"" was fixed upon for delivery of the country, and, as I supposed, all inventories and receipts ready for execution on the morning of that day. Whilst on my march to Pensacola, Maj. Staunton reported to meâ€ that M. Crusat ""secretary of Govâ€ Callava, had reported to him, that the ill health of the Governor, and great press of business had prevented him from having the inventory of the provisions, transportation for civil officers, their families and servants &"" &"", ready; but hoped that it would make no difference, as the Gov' was to remain, and as soon as his health would permit, the inventory and receipt should be made in comformity to the agreement contained in our correspondence, and satisfactory to me. I replied to the Major,"" that he was responsible for this Inventory and receiptâ€” if he had full confidence that the pledge would be complied with, I had no objection to this indulgence, as the Governor was illâ€”the Major replying"" that he had full confidence, the indulgence was granted. A few days after, wishing to close my communicationsâ€”the Governor being apparently well and walking the Townâ€”I directed Maj. Staunton to call upon him for a fulfilment of his engagement, and to my surprise after ten days he refused, I could not believe it possible, I ordered Doctor Bronough and Maj. Staunton to wait upon him with an Inven- tory"" precisely in the words of my letter of the 23"" of June 17 to which he had assentedâ€”He has refused however after this previous obligation, as stated in the report of Bronough and Staunton, to which I refer you."" I then wrote him my letter of the 3â€,â€ and have left him to the reflections of his own conscience, and have a hope that my Government will stamp his perfidy with such marks of displeasure as will convince Spanish Officers hereafter to comply with their engagements of honor. Having finished the arduous and unpleasant duty of establishing and putting in motion the Government in the Floridas I have a moment to spare to reply to your letter of the 23"" of May last.â€ I have to remark that the Judicial districts established by you in the Floridas are well arranged, and I have adopted them nearly in the division of the two counties I have established for Judicial purposes. As to the Gentlemen you have selected to fill the appointments in the Floridas, not knowing any of them but Judge Duval and Frommentin and those very slightly, I have no remark to make, believing that you would appoint none to office, that you did not believe competent and of good character. It is unfortunate that sometimes you may be, as we all are, imposed upon-As to myself I have only to say that I had a right to expect from the manner and inducements under which I agreed to accept the office, that at least the Secretary of West Florida would have been a man of my personal acquaintance, and in whom I had confidenceâ€”had I not confidently expected this, I should never have accepted the office; I feel however happy that the objects which induced my acceptance are nearly completed; the country has been received, the Government is organized and when in complete operation I shall eagerly embrace the condition which qualified my acceptance, which was, the liberty of retiring to private life, and it may be, that in the selection of your officers you had stieh an eye to this contingency. There are none of the officers appointed, yet arrived; except Judge Frommentin, who reached me on the 27"" ultÂ°, but not having his commission cannot enter upon the duties of his office. I would not be acting towards you with the faithfulness and candor of a friend, did I not bring to your view the opinions expressed here of the characters you have appointed as Judgesâ€”It is understood here that Mâ€ Duval is a good private character, but of very moderate capacity as a Lawyerâ€”as to M* Frommentin, his character is spoken of with great freedom; it is said and that too by men of high standing here, and 16 Aug. 3, 1821, NA (loc. cit.); not printed. 17 Ibid., printed, Bassett (ed), op. cit., pp. 76â€“78. 18 NA (loc. cit.), not printed. 19 Ibid., printed, Bassett (ed.), op. cit., pp. 108-111. those who have been here from New Orleans, that all are astonished at his being appointed as a Judge, and it is publickly stated, that he was brought up a Priest in France, at the downfall of the Bourbons he fled from the republican reignâ€”came to Americaâ€”settled in Maryland and married into a respectable familyâ€”removed to Orleans and was there appointed a senator in Congress, and whilst in that capacity on the restoration of the Bourbons, left his wife, took up with a base woman, travelled publickly with her to Orleans, and took her with him to Orleans France where he repaired, as is alledged and believed, to regain his Priesthood, disannul his marriage and continue his intercourse secret with this base woman: But disappointed in obtaining his Priesthood, he returned to America, conceded to his wife, and returned again to Orleans with hisâ€”wife her, where he resided until clothed with an agency under our Government appertaining to the treaty with Spain, he came here, borrowed money, which he failed duly to pay before he left here, for which suit was brought against him, and in the Spanish form proceedings of a kind of Outlawry were entered against him, all of which appear on record and were posted on the corners of the houses when I arrived. First impressions are always the most lasting, and it was of vital importance to the future welfare and greatness of this country, that in the first instance the Judiciary should have been filled, not only by men of unspotted and unimpeached moral character, but men of first standing in point of Legal Knowledge, securing them universal confidence both in their talents and integrity, and freedom from the suspicion of Bribery ahd or the capability of corruptionâ€”But what confidence can these people have in a Judiciary, protecting their moral and civil rights, in which the only Judge who presides, in his private walks respects neither? I must confess since I have heard this story (and it is freely spoken of and said to be publickly known) I should not like to continue in the administration of the Government with such an associate. The first duty of all Executives to the countries over which they preside, is to give to the people competent and fit persons to execute the laws provided for the security of their lives, their liberties, their reputations and their property; And I can assure you this confidence does not exist either in the Spanish or American population here, in the case of Judge Frommentin. Knowing this, I have viewed it as my duty to youâ€”as a friend to make it known, with the assurance that I have no unfriendly feeling towards Mr Frommentin. He is a polite, Gentlemanly man, but from the character given of him both here and in Orleans, both as to his capacity as a Judge and his moral character, I cannot confide in himâ€”As to the rest of the Gentlemen I have a good report; my only regret is, that they were not here to aid me in the labours of organizing the Government. However, with 301867-56-12 the aid of my old and faithful companions Doctor Bronough Cap' Call, with the assistance of Judge Brackenridge, whom I have found intelligent and very useful from his general acquaintance with the law, the Spanish language, usage and customs; I trust you will find the Government organised with the sole view to the protection of the citizen in all his rights secured under the Treaty and the constitution of the United Statesâ€” You will find from the report of the Quartermaster, Maj. Staunton,â€ accompanying the report to the Secretary of State. that the public buildings are in such a state of dilapidation, that it will not be in my power to accommodate M. Smith.â€ and others as you have requested. The Government House is the only one except the Block Houses and the Hospital, that is inhabitable, and the Government House was so unsafe that I gave it to the Quarter Master for as the Quarters of the Officers, and accepted in lieu thereof, the upper story of a House for my self, family and suit, by which there is a saving to the Government of upwards of one hundred dollars per month. The fine building called the barracks is in a state of ruin; a proposition has been made by a M. Edwards to repair it, for a lease of six years; the proposition I think a beneficial one and ought to be acceded to on the part of the Government; but having no power to accept it on the part of the Government, his proposition and my letter to him, have been referred to the Secretary of State,â€ to which I beg leave to draw your attention and request your early replyâ€”It will take from twelve to fifteen thousand dollars to make the repairs offered to be made by M"" Edwards, and if not made by some one in four months, it will be in such a state of ruin as will compel the corporation to pull it down, to preserve the lives of the citizens, who are in constant danger when passing under it. I should here close this letter; but that justice to the military character, which I hold dear, requires that I should brifly notice the recommendation redueing the Army accompanying the Register reducing the Army and recently made public. It is with extreme regret, that I have met the initiation produced by this unmilitary recommendation made by the board of Gen' Officers and promulgated to the world, where six meritorious officers are to be removed from place to place, reduced from grade to grade, and one driven out of office, to give one favorite officer an election of offices; however meritorious that officer might be, his merits cannot be superior to some of those six officers whose military feelings have been excoriated by this unusual, unmilitary procedure which has not its equal in military Annals. Gen' Atkinson is a favorite of mine, but still general justice is due to all, and we have no record of that superior display of Gen.' Atkinson's military prowess, of battles won, and countries saved, to justify such an election of offices, at the expense of others who were distinguished in the late war, and who had the honor in their country's cause to be engaged in more conflicts with the enemy, than any of those who composed the Board of Gen.' Officersâ€”I admit that it was due to Gen' Atkinson, that he should be provided for; but just in the way that other meritorious officers were; that one office should have been selected by the Board for him, which he might have accepted or not, at his pleasure. Can it have been supposed by this Board of high minded-military men, that those six officers of equal high minds and military merit, could ever brook the insult, and condescend to be drove from place to place, from grade to grade and some out of office, to make way for one individual not more meritorious than themselves? This could not have been thought by those who formed the Board, and why this recommendation has been published with the register, all military men are at a loss to discover, unless it was still more to excoriate the feelings of those six officers by holding forth Gen' Atkinson, their superior, and that those ef six were retained out of mere special favour, and placed at the disposal of the General. These military men must either be devoid of military feeling themselves, or calculate badly on the feelings of others. Can they expect others of equal military merit to succumb to things, that they themselves as military men would spurn? And let me ask, what will be the sensations of the Public, when it is understood that this election of offices has been given to one who has never fought one battle for his country, at the expense of others who have fought many, and always obtained the approbation of those who commanded them? To Gen' Gaines the officers of this Division looked for protection, and how he will be able to explain this, to the satisfaction of those Gentlemen, I cannot sayâ€”Co"" Taylor if I judge of him rightly, will resign and in short none of those who were thus placed in the Register, can consistently remain in the service; As for my own part before I would be thus degraded I would grub for a subsistence. I can assure you it has produced a general feeling of disapprobation, which I sensibly feel,  knowing the personal merits of several of those Gentlemen who deserved to be better treated by their country in a more delicate manner to say the least of it, for Gen' Atkinson could have been amply provided for without placing this unmilitary thing upon the register, or making any officers subordinate to his will and or election. I have thought it my duty thus far to remark, that you might consider the subject and extend justice to those men whose feelings are much wounded by this unexampled procedure, and such as never should have taken place without my public protest had I been one of the Board. Altho I have retired from the command of those brave and meritorious officers to the Prowess of many of whom I have borne testimony in the hour of battle and of danger, I still feel for them. With a tender of M"" Jackson's and my best wishes for M"" Munroe and your amiable family, and with my great regard for your individual happiness, I remain Sir with great respect. Y' Mo Obt Servant.

I presume it was intended merely for the purpose of plundering; but I hope, that, if they should repeat their visit, the measures you propose to take will put a stop to their proceedings. The French gentleman to whom you refer, I think it probable is M"". Penieres, who was recommended to this Department as a gentleman eminent for his various acquirements, who, being forced from France for political reasons, had selected this country for his residence, and who, in order to become intimately acquainted with the Indian Character, had resided several years among the Indians in the Arkansas Territory, and upon whom the President thought proper to confer the appointment of Sub-agent for Indian affairs in Florida: Under the authority of which appointment, I presume he is now acting, conformably to the instructions which he has received from this Department, and will therefore be respected accordingly. Gen.' Jackson was duly informed of his appointment, and authorized to give him such further instructions as he might think necessary. You will assure the Indians that may visit S*Augustine, that the views of the Government towards them are perfectly friendly, and that so long as they conduct themselves peaceably, they will be protected.

When I took possession here, I found nothing but an Alcalde, which was filled by a Spanish Military Officer, who could not therefore hold it under our Government. I appointed an Alcalde, Judge Brakenridge, in whose custody all archives received were placedâ€”finding that a Cabildo had once existed here, I ordained the reestablishmant of it, in that of a Mayor and Alderman of the city, adding a Board of Health to it, and there being no Judge, I created a County Court, with the powers that this Court would have held under the Constitution of Spain and that of the United States.â€ Col Butler reached me upon the 8* instant and reports, that he found at St Augustine an Alcalde, a Cabildo and a Judge, all in operation.

The time which was to intervene betwixt the moment when I received your letter of the 27"" June last "" & the moment when I was informed my answer should be deposited in the post office, was so short that I could not then touch upon the topic which is to be the subject of my present communication. When I first was informed of my appointment as Judge of the United States for West Florida &c. I understood it to be an appointment to the office of territorial judge with the additional jurisdiction vested in the judges of such territories where no district court of the United States has been established by the act entitled An act to extend jurisdiction in certain cases to the territorial courts passed march 3"" 1805.72 Upon receiving my commission & your letter of the 27""june last I was rather confirmed in that opinion by the concluding paragraph in your letter in the following words: â€œand towards the organisation of the temporary government under his (Gen. Jackson's) direction, it may be important that the judiciary department should be put into operation immediately. I may be mistaken; but it seems to me that if the court to which I am appointed is to be confined, as Gen. Jackson contends, to the revenue laws of the United States, and to the act respecting people of color, it could hardly be denominated the judiciary department with reference to the organisation of the temporary government under the direction of Gen. Jackson. However I deemed it my duty to communicate my commission & your letter to Gen. Jackson, who communicated to me in return such parts of his several commissions as he conceives admit of a construction entirely at variance with that which I put upon both my commission & your letter. It was then already too late for me to urge any objections, the territorial court consisting of five judges created by Gen. Jackson the presiding judge of which by the by is not of age according to the Spanish law which he administers, being only twenty two years, & the law requiring for that office that he should be at least twenty five years, having been already in session one week before my commission reached me. I told the General that I would write to you on the subject. He told me that he either had written to you already, or would write to you likewise.â€ In the meantime things must of course go on as I found them established on my arrival here, until I learn from you the precise intentions of the President respecting the extent of the powers vested in me. This representation, I beg you to believe, is not prompted on my part by the remotest desire of assuming a jurisdiction not intended to be given, but by a solemn obligation which I deem to be imposed upon me, to inform you of the difficulties in which I am placed, and to desire you to transmit to me as early as possible the necessary information. I have heard nothing of or from the marshal or any deputy appointed or to be appointed by him Since the date of my last. I feel very uneasy on the subject, as the public service must necessarily suffer from the absence of that indispensible officer, there being no authority here by which the deficiency may be supplied. 722 STAT. 338â€“339. The 27"" section of the act of september 24"" 1789 * prescribes the amount & the mode of the Security to be given by the marshal & his deputies; & the form of the oath to be taken by them. And unless Judge Duval should now be in S*Augustine to have those necessary forms complied with, I know not when I am to expect here a deputy marshal duly qualified. I say a deputy, because I understand that the marshal himself contemplates making S*Augustine the place of his habitual residence. I took the oath of office before Gen. Jackson. The attorney of the United States has not yet arrived.â€ Together with the present you will receive a packet delivered by me for you two years ago to Captain Ramage of the navy, by whom it was given to general Ripley with a request that he would forward it by mail."" The Gen. neglected it, & delivered it back to me a few days before I left New Orleans. I do not now recollect the contents, but still deem it proper, late as it is, now to forward it.

The Undersigned, the Members of the Bar of Pensacola, unanimously, and in the most respectful manner, represent, that they have seen, with extreme regret and mortification, the appointment, to a Judicial Office of high importance in this Province, by the Supreme Executive of the Federal Government, of a man, whose legal acquirements, and whose moral character, are equally unfitted to inspire those sentiments of respect, and that feeling of confidence, which are due to his elevated station, but which rank, however dignified, cannot alone confer. The dispensation of justice depends, not only on the wisdom and rectitude of the Bench, but on the integrity and consideration of the Bar. In a Court, in which it is deemed degrading to practice, honorable men will be reluctant to appear. Your Memorialists cannot stoop to rehearse the reports, which are in general circulation, of the unworthiness of Judge Fromentin, it is sufficient to say, that they are of a nature to arrest the attention of those, on whom rests the responsibility of selecting the public functionaries, and who have clothed him with authorityâ€”and of a currency, which if it be not conclusive evidence of their truth, is an imperative reason for their investigation. His incapacity, which might well have been argued from the defect of his education, has been rendered glaringly apparent from his first attempt to assume the exercise of power. Under these circumstances, Your Memorialists feel themselves called upon, most respectfully, but most urgently, to remonstrate against the nomination of Eligius Fromentin to the Senate of the United States, at their next session, as a candidate for the office of District Judge of the United States, for this District, and to protest against his appointment.

By degrees the crowd retired, & it was not till about eleven O clock that Mess Larua, Innerariti, D"" Brosnaham & father Coleman returned to my house. The three first applied to me for a writ of habeas corpus. I knew that it was in vain, having no marshal to execute my orders, to send an individual who could have no authority to demand it, for a copy of the warrant in virtue of which Col. Callava was detained; & that as that copy could & perhaps ought to have been refused by an officer of the army to that individual who could have no legal character to demand it, I could not from an affidavit of a refusal to deliver the copy of the warrant under those circumstances, find myself more authorised after than before such a refusal to issue the writ. And indeed could a legal demand have been made with success in the absence of a marshal from an officer of the army? Could any body have obtained from either Gen. Jackson or the officer in whose immediate custody Col. Callava was a copy of the warrant? Is it enough to have a right to trample under foot every law to place the officers charged with their execution in the impossibility of complying with the requisites of the law? Would not the same uncontrolable temper which manifested itself at the issuing of the writ, have manifested itself at the application for a copy of the warrant, which would have prevented the issuing of the writ, because nobody then could have been found to serve it? I felt anxious, Sir, after the application was made to me that the only judicial officer of the United States in West Florida, although with the consciousness of not being able to accomplish it, should do everything in his power to liberate Col. Callava from confinement. Is it fair to apply to me under the most extraordinary circumstances of difficulty the severity of the forms intended to be complied with in a state of undisturbed tranquillity? Besides there are no indispensibly necessary formalities absolutely required previous to the granting of that writ. The form of it may The sequel of the Vidal story is of some interest. When Innerarity failed to render an accounting, the heirs brought suit. Executions were levied against him in Jan. 1822 by the Superior Court of W. Fla., and upon his refusal to pay, the sheriff levied on and took away his negroes and furniture. See John C. Connor to Jackson, Feb. 3, 1822, and George Walton to id., Feb. 4, 1822 (LC, Jackson Papers, Vol. 61). vary a little according to the laws of the several states. Some may require security for costs, if the writ should be improperly applied for. Others may require security that the party in the act of bringing him before the judge shall not escape. Others may require other things. But there is not that I know of any particular prerequisite commanded by the laws or adopted by the courts of the United States, who, I believe, follow in that respect the particular forms prescribed by the laws of the state in which an application is made for the writ. I was then in that respect bound by no precedent; & I was forced to adopt the only mode which I had it in my power to pursue. The common law by allowing that particular writ to be served by any body and upon any body seemed to have anticipated the peculiar difficulties in which I was placed. The only question then for me to examine after a formal though verbal application was made to me, was whether I had a right to issue the writ. With that view I consulted my commission. I find myself there styled a judge of the United States authorised & empowered to execute & fulfill the duties of that office according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I need not say that I consulted the Constitution. But I consulted the acts of Congress, and in the 14"" connected with the 13"" section of the act of Sept. 24. 1789 I find that all the above mentioned courts of the United States have a right to issue the writ of Habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdiction, and agreable to the principles and usages of law. But again, says Gen. Jackson, the writ of Habeas corpus is not extended by law to this territory; & I must confine myself to the jurisdiction given by the act of Congress in the only two cases mentioned in the act, to wit: the revenue laws, & the importation of people of color. And could not I in return ask Gen. Jackson by what act of Congress Grand juries, & in criminal matters petty juries have been established in this territory. The general has established them. He has done rightâ€”I thank him for it. But is it more necessary for the protection of the liberties of the people that they should be tried in criminal matters by a jury than it is that they should have a remedy against the wild ravings of ungovernable tyranny? Let the events of the 22"" & I might add of the 23"" & 24"" days of this month answer the question. God grant that before long a still more eloquent answer be not furnished to the question! Yet, Sir, Determined as I was, as far as laid in my power, to endeavour to have justice done to Col. Callava, I was not less determined to have justice done to the country. I feel as deeply as any American, any attempt on the part of the agents of a foreign government, to disregard the rights of the United States. I once had an oportunity of expressing my opinion to you in writing on that very subject. & I may safely appeal to what I wrote then for a correct expression of what I must feel in every similar case. & although I do not believe a word of what is attempted to be laid to the charge of Col. Callava, yet in consequence of the state of agitation in which the whole country was thrown, I deemed it a duty, under the discretionary power vested in all the judges who have a right to grant the writ of Habeas corpus to require security; & I informed the friends of Col. Callava who applied to me for the writ, that I would, before setting Colonel Callava at liberty, require security for the production before me, of the papers said to be in his possession. Security was offered to any amount. I mentioned forty thousand dollars: Col. Callava himself in twenty thousand, & the two securities in ten thousand dollars each. M. Larua & M"" Innerarity agreed to become securities. I then issued the writ marked NÂ° 1.â€ & delivered it to be served on the officer who had the guard of the prison where Col. Callava was confined to D. Brosnaham another of the friends of Col. Callava who had joined in applying for the writ. In the meantime I prepared a rough draft of the recognisance a copy of which is sent marked NÂ° 2."" The rough draft of that recognizance was on my table when Col. Walton came to bring me the order from Gen. Jackson to be hereafter mentioned, & I gave it to him to read. I was engaged in making some necessary alterations in the draft of that recognisance when I received from the officer of the day the letter marked NÂ° 3."" in answer to the writ I had issued. I dropped the unnecessary labour of putting the recognizance in a better shape. The soldier who brought me the letter of the officer of the day had scarcely left my house, when Col. Walton entered it with the written order above alluded to from Gen. Jackson to me marked NÂ° 4.â€ After some conversation with Col. Walton, in the course of which I mentioned to him what I had done & intended to do in this business, I gave him to read as before stated the rough draft of the recognizance. I then desired him to furnish me with a certified copy of the written order which he had given me to read, & he agreed to call on me at five Oclock for my answer. He returned in about half an hour, & gave me the written copy I had applied for. In the meantime, Having reflected on the strange message of Gen. Jackson, I determined upon writing to him the letter a copy of which accompanies this marked NÂ° 5."" About five Oclock Col. Walton returned according to promise; & I gave him to read the letter which I had prepared in answer to the written communication of Gen. Jackson. After reading it several times He advised me not to send it, & observed that as he himself knew that I was then suffering from a severe rheumatism which prevented me from walking, he would state the fact in his return, & that I could thus further advise what I thought best to do. This letter was not of course sent to Gen. Jackson. We had some further conversation, & at parting I told the Col. that in the situation in which I was, nothing but force would compel me to leave my house. The Colonel made his return. I did not see him again that day; & when night came, I anticipated a renewal of the scene of the day before, & prepared myself for the consequences. However nobody came to disturb me. The next day about noon the Col returned, & observed that both the general & myself must be desirous of making a report of this affair to the government by the next mail; that there was no time to be lost, & that it was the general's wish that I should call at his office the next day in the morning. After the Col. had withdrawn I reflected that the state of things was now somewhat different from what it was the day before. A reason was assigned for my having an interview with the General, the force of which I felt. and ultimately a longer resistance would only end in affording Gen. Jackson the scandalous triumph of once more trampling upon the laws of his country. I determined to go there that very afternoon; & accordingly at about 4 O clock P. M. I went to the office of Gen. Jackson The conversation, as you may suppose, was nearly all on one side, not unmixed with threats of what he said he had a right to do for my having dared to interfere with his authority. He asked me whether I would dare to issue a writ to be served upon the Captain General of the island of Cuba. I told him No. but that if the case should require it, and I had the necessary jurisdiction, I would issue one to be served on the President of the United States. Ultimately he wished to know the name of the persons who had applied for the writ of Habeas corpus. I unhesitatingly told them to him. Then he wished to know whether they had made the usual affidavit stating that they had been refused a copy of the warrant upon which Col. Callava was confined. I told him No. that the application to me was a verbal one. Gen Jackson then required me to sign what I had just declared. I told him I was ready to do it; & I did it accordingly, D"" Bronough who was present at the conversation having reduced that part of it to writing. Much more was said by the General respecting the extent of his powers, the happy selection made of him by the President; the hope that no living man should ever in future be clothed with such extraordinary authority. How fortunate it was for the poor that a man of his feelings had been placed at the head of the government! &c. &c. &c. &c. &c. The whole intermixed with or rather consisting alto- gether of the most extravagant praises of himself, & the most savage & unmerited abuse of Col. Callava & of myself for doing my duty in attempting to set him at liberty. The first time the authority of Gen. Jackson is contested I should not be surprised, if to all the pompous titles by him enumerated in his order to me marked NÂ°. 4."" he should superadd that of grand inquisitor, & if finding in my library many books formerly prohibited in Spain, and among others the Constitution of the United States he should send me to the stake. I had taken the liberty in the course of my conversation with him to contest some of the powers he assumes as governor & intendant, &c, of which legal powers both previous to and since the adoption of the Spanish constitution he appears to me not to have the remotest knowledge. As to the Spanish constitution he will not hear of it, although it was solemnly sworn to here about sixteen months ago. Nothing will do for him but the laws which were in force in Spain on the 19* february 1819. So that the first initiation of the inhabitants of Florida in the enjoyment of liberty must be by a retrograde step from a state of comparative liberty to a state of absolute Slavery. I attempted to represent, but he would not let me go on. Ultimately I was permitted to depart without having suffered but in my feelings as an American. The American flag, it is true, The flag of liberty waves on our forts. A treacherous sign in Florida, Sir. The bohon-upas tree of slavery overshadows our town. Sirit is reluctantly that I speak thus of a man whom once I delighted to honor. But I owe you the truth, & painful as the task may be, I must discharge my duty.â€ I have the honor to be with great respect Sir your most Ob.h. Servt. ELIG.

AUGUSTINE,"Mr MAYOR & GENTLEMEN, It will be necessary, since the organization of the civil Government of East Florida, that suitable buildings, rooms and offices be procured and designated for the accomodation of its various Departments. It can scarcely be requisite to mention that those Buildings which were heretofore appropriated to the military, or which may now be necessary for the small peace establishment which is stationed here, will not come within the scope of this communicationâ€”But as the surrender of this Province to Col. Butler rendered it fit that for the time being he should occupy for the safekeeping the public edificesâ€”It may be well to make a general statement of everything as it has since the transfer and does at this moment exist. I would suggest your procuring information on the following heads- 1* The National property transferred to the United States, discribing it specificallyâ€”the uses to which it was designed under the Spanish Governmentâ€”the uses to which it has been assigned since and at this timeâ€”Its probable cost to the Spanish Governmentâ€” Its value now if sold on a credit of one, two, or three yearsâ€”How much it would bring if rentedâ€”which are tenantable as they now areâ€” How much would repair themâ€”what would be the best course for the United States to pursue with them. 2"" The property belonging to the city of Sâ€™ Augustine, with the same enquiries as above, and what would be the best course for the City council to take on it. It will occur to you that the Civil Officers of the United States must have fixed places to transact the public businessâ€”The Secretary and acting Governor of this Territory has addressed a short note to the Secretary at War by last mail to know if the Government House is to remain with the civil or the military authority""â€”He did this because, he has been and is still under much inconvenience for a suitable place to receive the Citizens and inhabitants of this province for the transactions of their official concerns. Altho' the Secretary of the Province can very well put up with an inconvenience of this kind, as he is not certain that he has an absolute right to demand a House either for himself and family or as an officerâ€”Yet it is hoped that ere long the Governor of the Floridas, acting as Captain General &â€ may pay this important and interesting portion of his Territories a visit and may even prefer it as his permanent residenceâ€”He would therefore submit whether it will comport in such a probable event with the respect which is due to the chief Magistrate of these Provinces, and whether it will not unavoidably embarras the transactions of the public affairs, that no suitable place should be in readiness to receive him. The Judge of the District Court of the United States, the Marshal, Attorney, Clerk, &"", it would seem ought to have a place to hold their Court and keep their offices. The officers of the Revenue have I believe already a place to transact the affairs of the Customsâ€”The City council, The territorial Court of the County of S*Johns, The high Sheriff as well as other territorial officers which will occur to you, ought in some manner to be accomodated for the benefit and convenience of the people at large with the transaction of whose business [they]"" are charged. It gives me pleasure to state that Captain Bell offered me everything which he deemed within his controul to accomodate me temporarily, but as that accomodation might terminate on the arrival of Col. Eustis here, which was daily expected, I declined placing either him or myself in a predicament which might turn out to be peculiarly delicateâ€”Should there be any appropriate places for public worship under our system of free tolleration you will of course make particular mention of them. A full and speedy report on this subject with a view of submitting it to the highest authority is required.

A passport had been issued to Chazotte by the Secretary of State on May 1, 1821 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., xix), to visit E.

Worthingtonâ€” [Enclosure: Dup.] Acting Governor Worthington (East Florida) to Governor Jackson (Copy.) â€œBâ€ S*AUGUSTINE, 28* August, 1821. SIR, Neither wishing it, nor deeming it politic, when Captain Bell transferred his civil powers to me on the 20"" inst, as I have already written to you that the Mayor & Council who had acted since the cession should become also instanter functus officio, I that day requested them to continue still in the Gov"" and meet me at 10. A.M. in the Council chamber on the 22"" the ensuing wednesday, when I would lay before them your ordinances or such of them as could in the interim be printed, I found that not more than one or two of them could be printed in that time, so I ordered NÂ° 3. respecting Naturalization, to be first struck off and brought to me at the council chamber by the hour of meeting, it was so. The Mayor and Council assembled, I took my Seat as President of the Board, made a short address growing out of the Ordinances, complimented the Mayor and the other members on the late discharge of their functions, and as it was necessary to reorganize their body according to your Ordinances, hoped that they would still consent to officiateâ€”The Mayor and everyone of the Council, with the exception of S D"" Francisco J. Fatio, declined, because they said they could not at this time abjure their allegiance to the King of Spain. They were all Spanish Subjects, I did not say whether that was absolutely necessary as a preliminary to an office in this territory, they took the ground themselves, and having taken it, I did not think it essential for me to say it was not a necessary prerequisite, so I accepted of all their resignations, except Mr Fatio, who when I came to him rose up and boldly said, â€œSir, I will take the oath of allegiance to the United-States with pleasure.â€ I then dissolved the meeting, and stuck up notices that the civil officers under the new organization would meet at the same place on saturday the 25* and in the most public manner take their respective oaths of office. In the interim altho' the late Mayor and council had withdrawn from being considered candidates, I determined to offer some of the most honourable and important appointments to the native and old inhabitants of the province, and to endeavour to get a due number of Spaniards, Minorcans, French, Irish, Americans, &"" into the new government if they would accept of places. I wrote a circular, of which the enclosed marked A. is a copy,â€ to some of the most wealthy and respectable of them to be Judges, Aldermen, & they declined it by letter on the ground that they were not prepared to abjure their subjection to the King of Spain and take the oath of allegiance to the United States, altho' you will see in my circular that it is not expressed as a prerequisite, but even if I had not thought it a prerequisite, after they had come out and said they could not take the oath of allegiance to the U. S. I could not then have thought it proper to appoint anyone of them, I then filled up the commissions in the best way I could, as you will see by the list marked B.â€â€”Accordingly under the waving flag of the Union, on the 25"" the civil officers assembled with a large concourse of people, some officers of the Army and Navy were present and forty odd Indians who had just come in. I opened the ceremony by a short address confined to the occasion, then administered the oath to Judge Fitch, who successively swore in Col. Forbes the new Mayor and the other officers,â€ and the registry for naturalization was opened at the same time; the meeting was then closed, the City Council to meet on the 27* I then opened the talk with the Indians, which turned out to be not of sufficient consequence to detail to you, I requested Captain Bell to be present and to take note of it, which he did, and if anything shall grow out of it worth communicating, it will be done. On the 27â€ the city council met, and I sent them the enclosed Executive communication marked C*- There is from various unofficial accounts some disturbance and distractions amongst the Indians, I shall in a few days have a Chief in, and shall endeavour to procure all necessary information, which shall be transmitted forthwith. I believe things are exaggerated by some of our countrymen who may be mischievously and illegally intermeddling amongst them, this is necessary to be known, and I will as soon as possible procure and transmit the informationâ€”I have thus briefly endeavoured to detail our acts and views consecutively as they have transpired, I will now cast an eye retrospectively by way of recapitulating the secondary and minor incidents. With the determination agreeably to your wish of giving the appointments of prosecuting Attâ€ and clerk of the Court of the county of S*Johns, to Major Willis, and M. Patterson. I waited a weekâ€”there are neither of them hereâ€”Judge Fitch and Captain Bell both know Mr Patterson and Major Murray, and I have thought under all circumstances, it would meet your approbation to appoint M. Murray, and have done so, but Mâ€ Gibbs is appointed with the express understanding, when Major Willis arrives to relinquish it to himâ€”M. Gibbs is an old and respectable man, the court could not go on without these two officers, it was very requisite at this time, I hope this proceeding will meet your approbation. Neither Judge Duval, M. Bird, M* Hackley, Col. Eustis, &"" have yet arrived-I feel a perfect confidence that as the orb of our civil vernment rises and sheds its benign influence in this province, all its functions will be performed with the utmost harmony.â€”The civil and military spheres do not without violence interfere with each other, and I am resolved to do everything in my power which can be fairly expected from me to maintain and preserve their mutual peace and concord, I know this friendship and good will between the Citizen Soldier, and the soldier citizen in our Republic is what the President and yourself and every good and reflecting man in our Country rejoices to see. I am led to these remarks from having understood that before I arrived here there was considerable feeling excited in this city. As on occasions of this sort, generally both parties are more or less in the wrong. I did not allude to it in my last letter wishing that oblivion might weave over it, her impervious web; and to tell you the truth it is an unpleasant subject to enquire into, and I know of no good which could arise from stirring up the matter, I have declined knowing anything of the particulars, but have left them to sleep in the tomb of the Capulets.â€”I know that you and the General Government must dislike being uselessly troubled with such little party bickerings. I don't know that I have any right to claim a house to keep my office in, I have therefore not made a demand, althoâ€™ I think the old government house might have been assigned for that purpose, and as a Lieutenant and Surgeon of the troops were in it, and I understand could not give it up without an order from the Secretary of War, I wrote him the short note on the subject marked D.â€ Whether not only that house but the house occupied formerly by the Collector of the Customs, and some others for aught I know, are to be held by one or two persons placed in each, â€™till Col. Eustis, or anyone else comes on to make his choice, and a half dozen other public buildings are to be kept 'till the troops shall want themâ€”and all this military establishment, to accomodate only 120. men, with a requisite number of officers, is the best disposition of those public buildings, I should suppose does not even afford a question; my own opinion is, that the Fort and its appendages, for such a place as this ought to be the only exclusive Military establishment. In time of peace the officers, if they prefer it, can find the same accomodation which they do in many other of our cities which have no exclusive quarters appropriated for themâ€”If at any time it be necessary to remove the men from the Fort, they would be better placed on the edge, than in the heart of a city, as also hospital establishments. I have thought it my duty to invite your attention to this subject, as you know our citizens are so very watchful and sensible to anything which should have even the slightest squinting towards a military or any other than a civil constitutional government. I know that you would not wish any of the U. S. subordinate civil or military officers, under you; imprudently to be betrayed into any acts which might give even the captious and evil disposed anything, like a semblance, of imputation that they would wish to see the civil subordinate to the military authority, in even the most remote and recent part of our territories. This I consider would be in repugnance to the most sacred interest of the very vital genious of our countryâ€”I know in this sentiment I must have the honour to accord with you, who I understand have from your early life been bred up to expound the Laws and Constitution of our country; who in mature life, after your habits and opinion must have been all formed, laid aside the civil citizen and took upon you the Republican soldier, and now exchange the character of a victorious general for that of one of our principal civil magistratesâ€”It is painful to me to write on this subject, because it is one which may be perverted to look more like a matter of selfishness than principle. As to myself, so far as I may be concerned, I shall with great cheerfulness acquiesce in any decision which you may think proper to make in the premisesâ€”or which may be made by the Secretary of Warâ€”I have no doubt the present state of things first grew out of the peculiar state of affairs, and is now only continued, â€™till the proper authority can new model it. When the City council shall report on my communication of yesterday marked C. I will enclose it without delay.â€ I transmit you the Ordinances which have been printed NÂ° 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.28 With very great respect, &"" (Signed) W. G. D.

Lewis on the necessity & propriety of employing two Inspectors of the Customs here at this time, it was determined that in the course of a very short time it would be indispensable to the security of the Revenue, that an Inspector should be stationed at the Barancas (in the immediate vicinity of the entrance to the Bay on which this Town is situated) whose duty would be to board all Vessels coming in the harbour, and by his presence become a check upon the accomplishment of the illicit intentions of the ill disposed, as well as to be so situated that by opportunely employing any leisure time with a Boat at his command, a watchful eye might be kept upon the numerous inlets upon this Coast, situated in an Easterly direction, within the limits of this district. Mr Brownjohn has accordingly been retained, his vigilance, intelligence and activity have already been of essential service, and I have to request your approval of his appointment as Inspector of the Customs at this port. From the information I have been able to collect from persons acquainted with the navigation of the coast of West Florida, there arises a strong presumption that the employment of a Revenue Cutter on this station,"" will be perhaps indispensable, and one of a force superior to either of those now empleyed engaged either on the Mobile or Mississippi district; a row boat is already much wanted, for the Custom house hitherto the Inspectors have been able to hire one for the occasion as requisite, but the practice if continued, will be found bad economy. I would request your approval of the disbursement requisite for the purchase of a boat adapted to the use for which she will be required.

"LC: Jackson Papers, Vol. 60: C",Report,REPORT OF ST. AUGUSTINE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC PROPERTY,,,"Reportâ€”The undersigned Members of the Committee appointed by a resolution of the Honorable City Council to prepare a report in compliance with the requests contained in an official communication to the Council from W. D. G. Worthington Esqâ€ Secretary and acting Gov' of East-Florida dated August 27** having been duly qualified proceeded to obtain information on the following heads as recommended in his letter of that date: â€œ1â€ The national property transferred to the United States describing it specifically: the uses to which it was designed under the Spanish Government: the uses to which it has been assigned since, and at this time: its probable Cost to the Spanish Government: its value now if sold on a credit of One two and three years; how much it would bring if rented: what are tenantable as they now are: how much would repair them: what would be the best Course for the United States to pursue with them. 2"" The property belonging to the City of St. Augustine with the same Enquiries as above; and what would be the best course for the City Council to take on it.â€ In the first place your Committee beg leave to observe that their Statement as contained in the Report while answering as far as practicable to the enquiries on the general state of Public property does not distinguish the Class or denomination it may fall under whether National or Municipal: It has been impracticable for the Committee to act otherwise from the peculiar form of, and measures adopted by the former Government; the Governor or person in chief command assuming as a general maxim that whatever did not appertain to an Individual necessarily fell to the King, and regardless of the Rights of the City as a Corporate Body, crowded every public building with idle Soldiery till crumbling in ruins over thier heads they were forced to abandon them: In like manner we find transferred as National property Public Squares, which were always intended for the Ornament Salubrity and Utility of the City: the Catholic Church, a building raised by individual Subscription and belonging to the Catholic Congregation, the Burying Ground of the same which was the Donation of a charitable person, and other similar inconsistencies. In this investigation the Committee have taken for their guide the Iventory of Public property delivered over by the Spanish Engineer,"" and marked NÂ° 3 in the list of documents accompanying the communication from the Executive, but their labours have been much impeded from the want of the several plans delivered up with that document, particularly the General plan of the Town, to which continual reference is made in the Inventory, and upon which it appears all the public property was distinctly marked: these plans it seems were taken away from St. Augustine by the United States Commissioner who received the * [Public property from the Spanish Authorities, and unfortunately no copies whatever were made, and nothing has been left to supply their place: It is more peculiarly unfortunate that no plan remains of any description to serve as a guide in the decisions upon the various conflicting interests, which necessarily will come in contact in explaining NÂ° 21. of the Inventory before mentioned, in which it is specifically stated that within the limits of the City there are many pieces of ground occupied by individuals who have no good Title thereto and that all such are to be considered as Public property and forming part of the formal delivery: in the same manner there is stated to be a piece of ground between the Powder Magazine and Fort Maria Sanchez as Public Property without defining its limits.â€” The Committee respectfully submit the following abstractresult of their enquiries classed under the different heads as requested, accompanied by their observations thereon: The Numeration of the Public property in this abstract is the same as in the Engineers Inventory aforesaid NÂ° 3; in which the said property will be found to be Specifically described.""â€” NÂ° 1. The Fort. As no doubt can exist as to this, & as it is intirely within the Controul of the military the Committee have nothing to observe hereupon NÂ° 2. The Lines. At present the Lines are considered as being occupied by the military: whether it be elligible or not to keep them in repair is not the object of the Committee to enquire, but as the Guard at the Gate of the Town is no longer continued and as the Guard House is placed in the middle of the Street obstructing the way and becoming a nuisance, the Committee would recommend the removal thereof immediately NÂ° 3. The Powder Magazine & Guard House. As only a small quantity of damaged powder is deposited in this building and as much inconvenience is felt for want of a Public Prison, the Committee strongly recommend its temporary appropriation for that purpose The Guard House might well serve as a kitchen for the Jailor and the Magazine is well adapted as a place of Security.â€” NÂ° 4. The Burnt Barrack Lot.â€”The old chimnies remaining on the Ground were sold some years back to M' Gay: The Lot is recommended by the Committee for Sale.â€” NÂ° 5. The Old Convent.â€”The Committee have directed considerable attention to this Building from a conviction of the great general uses to which it might be appropriated if put in good repair: The walls appear generally to be good with a few exceptions which might be easily and substantially remedied.â€” There are] Eight large Saloons on the upper Story: the four on the Wings 50 ft. by 24: the four central ones 36. feet by 24; and a similar distribution on the Ground floor: a thorough repair of the Roof, new laying the floors, new doors and Windows and other repairs to make the Building serviceable would probably occasion an expence of $6,000; which would be amply repaid by the accommodations it would afford for every branch of National, Territorial and Civic Business; but about one half of the above sum would place it for immediate purposes in tolerable good order: The Spacious Court Yard in the rear and its Eligible situation would probably make it even more adapted for a College than any, other purpose, at all events its immediate repair is an object of the first importance. Contiguous to this old Convent is a large range of old Stone Offices totally in ruins: The Committee beg leave to recommend that an immediate Sale of the materials be made, to be of course removed, as in their present state they are a nuisance, and the sum of 600$ at least would be obtained therefrom. NÂ° 6. The Government House. This Building was alway occupied as the residence of the Governors of this Province until falling into decay it was considered only fit to have the habitable Rooms appropriated for Soldiers quarters: but the late Governor had not long since, began to make considerable repairs to it, and had entertained the intention of moving into it had not the Evacuation of the Province taken place: The Committee have estimated the Sum of $2000 as necessary to complete the repairs and make this Building suitable for a Town-Hall and City Offices; or as a State-House for Territorial purposes, or for the accomodation of Public Officers: at present it affords quarters to five Officers of the United States Troops. The lot being very spacious other Buildings might be Erected there as required. NÂ°7 The Custom House. &c. This Building consists of two Wings: The Southern wing in its upper part furnishes Offices for the United States revenue; the lower part is a Guard-House which will evidently be required for the City Patrol: the northern wing is occupied as quarters by the Commanding Officer of the Garrison above, and as the United-States Stores below. Whether this Building is necessary or not for the small peace Establishment now stationed here the Committee are unable to say, but all the other public buildings are so completely ruinous that in the event of the arrival of the Chief Magistrate, this would be found to be the only one immediately tenantable. NÂ° 8. The National School. The Committee recommend that this Building continue as a temporary accommodation for the City Council above; and that the lower part be appropriated for the present for holding the Territorial Court: And the Committee cannot point out for Divine worship on the Sabbath any Rooms more appropriate than these. NÂ° 9. The Black-Smiths Shop or Smithy. The Committee recommend the Sale of this lot; it is however their duty to observe that the Smith placed there by the Spanish Government was induced (from hopes held out to him of having an absolute grant of the whole for Services) to make considerable additions to the lot and buildings, the value of which the Committee estimate at $200; which improvements the Committee recommend to be retained and not taken away, and that the Smith be reimbursed the above sum out of the proceeds of the sale of the lot and Building NÂ° 10. The Burnt Hospital lot. The Committee recommend this lot and the ruins thereon to be sold. NÂ° 11. Hospital and Shop. The Committee beg permission most strongly to recommend the removal of this Hospital from the Centre of the Town to a place where it might be established with propriety: (see NÂ° 20.) Its situation in so public a place is evidently improper and even indecent. The lot is recommended for sale, the present ruinous state of the Building not justifying the expence of repairs. Should any interval occur between the removal of the Hospital and the Sale, the Rooms are well adapted for temporary public Offices. NÂ° 12. Dragoon Barracks. Recomended to be sold. NÂ° 13. Old Powder-House. This old building is situated in the Centre of a Lot containing about 10 acres of land whose value is esti- mated at $100. p"" acre: the remote situation, the absolute ruin of the House, and the lowness of the Ground do not Justify a higher value: The Committee recommend that it be sold. NÂ° 14 The Look-out Tower. Not conceived within the scope of NÂ° 15 Matanzas Tower. J this report. No 16. The old Church lot. Recommended to be sold. NÂ°17. The Market Place. The small wooden buildings & Sheds erected on this public square are strongly recommended by the Committee to be removed as a public nuisance. They were always considered as temporary and liable to be taken away at a moments notice: they produce little or no revenue and spoil the appearance of the Square. The Stone market may remain till a more suitable place can be provided. No 18. The Catholic * These are considered private prop- No 19. Cemetery. erty. No. 20. Flour Magazine. This Building is occupied by the families of two or three Soldiers of the United States Troops. It is extremely well calculated for an Hospital: at all events the Committee strongly recommend the immediate removal to this building for the present of the Sick from their present situation in the centre of the town. NÂ° 21. Squares and Public places. &c. As no specific definition of most of these places is given, as as no plan is here to assist the Committee, they can only mention the Square in front of the Government House and the one between the Burnt Barracks lot and old Convent, both of which have always been public Squares they recommend to be kept as such for the salubrity and Ornament of the City: With respect to the large portion of Land situated to the North of the Lines and within the precincts of the City, the Committee are of opinion that for the present it be considered as the Town Common. From the foregoing exposition it is Evident that few if any Buildings are suitable for the well accomodation of the various departments: consisting generally of large lots and ruinous Edifices, they are in their present state almost useless although they swell the Inventory and appear of importance: The Committee respectfully recommend the Sale of many of them, and the appropriation of the proceeds to the thorough repair of the Buildings retained. By this a noble range of Public Halls for every purpose would be obtained without expence, thereby conferring there an honor on the Corporation and becoming an Ornament to the Town and an Enhancement of the Province. The old Convent (NÂ° 5) or even the one half thereof would form an elegant and Spacious College, and situated on the most airy spot of this Montpelier of North-America would draw Students from all parts of the Southern Sections of the Union. The Committee refrain from detailing the advantages that would arise from the redemption of the Marsh in the rear of the Town, as they have for the causes before stated no means of ascertaining whether it is public or private property. The Committee cannot close this report without respectfully and earnestly recommending that measures be adopted for the return of the Plans originally delivered by the Spanish Government to the United States Commissioners and also of Stating that among the Archives not given up by the Ex-Governor, there is a large mass of Documents exclusively appertaining to the Office of the City Engineer which are of the utmost importance both to the Corporation and to the Territorial Government: but of which no public mention or intention of delivery has been made * Signed P.

"NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., J42:LS *",Correspondence,GOVERNOR JACKSON TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,GOVERNOR JACKSON,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,"HON. J. CALHOUN Sec. at War. SIR, By last mail I received enclosed to me by Capt"" Bell,"" commanding, and executing the civil government at S* Augustin, the unauthorised talk held by Horatio Dexter and M. Wanton, with what they are pleased to call the king of the Siminoles and fifty four of the principal indians present. It appears that this talk with the Seminoles, has been forwarded to some of the departments, whether to you is not mentioned, and were it not for its novelty, and the object which appears obvious, I should not have troubled you with the transmission of such a paper, or with any comments upon it. The object of this unauthorised proceeding appears to me, evidently to be, first, on the part of Dexter & Wanton to obtrude themselves on the notice of the Government, and secondly, to impress on the minds of the Indians, their absolute right to the country. I have written to Mr Worthington to seize these self made Indian agents,â€ and detain them until the instructions of the Government can be had. And this talk proves the necessity of Congress taking the subject up, and by law prescribing bounds to the Seminoles. The exposed situation of the Floridas, imperiously demands, that its frontier upon the coast, if it may be so expressed, should be immediately inhabited by our white citizens. The Indians, at present, are scattered from Florida Point to the Chactahatchy. If you attempt to concentrate or consolidate them, at the Micksucky Pond, or Old Towns, you offend those that are situated on the Suwaney, on the Latchua Plains, or on the Peninsula. As they have been continually at war with the United States, until conquered in the Spring of 1818, when they were ordered up above the Florida line where the nation to which they originally belonged, was willing to receive them, such a measure would reconcile all. This is what they expected, and what good policy and the safety of the Georgia frontier required. But this is what these unauthorised Indian agents, who offer their services to both parties, as I conceive, wish to prevent, and on which the Government ought seriously to reflect. The Government cannot turn the torrent of emigration to the Floridas without great expence; good policy and the safety of the frontier, in my opinion, require that the govenmet should promote emigration to this country, and hasten its admission as a State into the Union. If the Indians be removed within the limits of the country assigned to the Creek nation, (of which the Seminoles are a part,) this object, on which the security of the Southern border so much depends, will be speedily attained. With what pretence of justice can those who fled from the Creek nation, and kept up an exterminating war on our frontier until crushed by the arm of our government in 1818, set up such claims? And is the safety of our frontier to be jeopardised by the complaints of a few indians excited by would be indian agents, and indian treaty makers, who compose flowry talks for them and put words into their mouths they never conceived, and make indian chiefs to suit their own views, and who were never heard of as such before? The greater part of the indians now in the Floridas consist of those who fled in the manner already mentioned, and why should we hesitate to order them up at once, when the Executive goverment with the aid of Congress, can do ample justice, by law if necessary, justiee to those who deserve it, by giving such equivalent as will enable them to settle their families [indecipherable word crossed out] in the upper country, and to cultivate their farms. Unless the Indians be consolidated at one point, where is the country that can be brought into market, from which the five millions are to be raised, to meet the claims of our citizens under the late treaty with Spain? I received by last mail a letter from M. Peniers of the 14"" of May last,â€ and another of the tenth of July.â€ By the latter, he informs me he is about to proceed to the Havanna to enquire whether any treaties have been made with the Indians by Spain. Whether this be in pursuance of instructions from you, I am not advised; but surely the Government of the United States, is competent to regulate the concerns of these indians and mete to them every justice to which they are entitled, and to make such regulations as the safety of the frontier may require, without referrence to any treaty with Spain, and particularly when it is notorious, that the greater part of those Indians, as already observed, fled from the creek nation in 1813 and 1814, adhered to our enemies, continued their warefare under the excitement of British agents and Spanish incendiaries, until the United States from self defence were compelled to chastice and conquer them. I have made enquiries for a proper character duly qualified to act as interpreter for M'Peniers. It requires, as M. Peniers does not speak english, that that interpreter should speak, the English, Indian, and French languages. Such a one is difficult to be found, in short I can hear of none but M'Hambly, and for him I have sent, but am informed that he is with the Creek agent. I advised you in my last that the indisposition of M""J. would compel me to travel with her as soon as her health would permet, out of this Southern climate; and this would prevent me from holding a treaty with the indians, although to speak candidly I am determined never to be concerned in another. I do think it not only useless but absurd. When Congress has the power to regulate all Indian concerns, by act of Congress, and the arm of the government is sufficiently strong to carry such regulations into effect. More general justice can be done to the Indians, in this way than by treaty. When the policy of treating with the indians was first adopted it was at a time when we found them thrown upon our hands by the treaty of 1783, without any provision being made for them, and at that time they were numerous and hostile, while the arm of the government was too weak to enforce such regulations as justice and good policy required, hence the necessity of managing them by treaties. But this has passed away, the arm of government is sufficient to protect them and to carry into execution any measures called for by justice to them, or by the Safety of our frontier borders. Hence the absurdity of holding treaties with indian tribes within our territorial limits, subject to our sovregnty and municipal regulations, and to whom, by legislation, every justice can be done, and the safety of our Southern frontier perfectly secured. These were some of the reasons that weighed upon my mind for addressing the government on this subject last Spring, in hopes that I would be authorised by the Executive to have carried into full effect the orders I had given them in 1818, and which had been given after consulting the chiefs of the Creek nation and finding it to be their wish and that they were willing to receive them. At that time many of them went up and I am informed are now living happily there. I pray you to look at the map of the Floridas and you will at one glance see that to locate them in the Floridas, they will greatly weaken your frontier, when by removing them you clear the Southern borders of all Indians.â€ Since writing the foregoing, I have made enquiry respecting Dexter, and Wanton, and am informed by a gentleman on whom, from his character and standing in Society every reliance can be placed, that those persons are profligate characters, and are and have been engaged in forming a settlement a settlement in the Alatchua plains under the grant of the duke de Alagon, and it is said have obtained a grant from the indians by deed duly executed before witnesses, relinquishing to them all indian claim to a large tract of country. From the bare reading of Dexters letter, and the Indian talk, I was impressed with the belief that Messâ€ Dexter, and Wanton were just such characters as above described, and in whom no confidence ought to be placed, and who ought, as I have directed, to be sent beyond the Floridas. Nothing more clearly proves the imperious necessity of ordering those deluded Indians to the upper country, where they can be kept clear of such improper and mischievous influence, where they can be protected and made happy by the bounty and humanity of of our Governmtâ€ I am, Sir, Respectfully Your Most Obed"" Ser' ANDREW JACKSON Gov"" of the Floridas &c &c &c THE HONBLE J.

I have been authorized to appoint an Agent to hold a conference with the Indians within the Floridasâ€”But until M Penniers the Sub Agent of Indian Affairs arrives or until I hear from the Government to whom I have written for instructions on this subject I shall neither appoint an Agent or attempt to convene the Indiansâ€”indeed they are so scattered over the Floridas that it would be impossible at this season to collect them.

"NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., J. 43:LS",Correspondence,GOVERNOR JACKSON TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,GOVERNOR JACKSON,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,"SIR, Since I closed my letter of the 17* inst.â€ to you, Neamothla, one of the chiefs of the Florida Indians, accompanied by the Mulatto chief and John Blount with an Interpreter, Stephen Richards, have visitted me. From the enclosed talk held with them marked, A,â€ you will discover the object of their visit, their disposition and wishes. They have left me, well pleased, and happy to hear that a country will be given them some where by the President of the U States, in which they will be collected and settled, and receive the protection of the U States. They acknowledge that it is just, that those who rejected peace when it was offered to them, and fled from their own country, continuing the war, ought to return to their own nation, that they believe all those are willing to return, but are afraid, that they will not be protected. I have written to Gen"" M*Intosh "" on this and other subjects, a copy of which I also enclose you; I have no doubt, it being made known to them through the Agent of the Creek nation, that they must return and that on their return they will be protected, the whole would immediately move up, and as these Indians can have no claim to lands in the Floridas, humanity and justice is sufficiently extended to them by such permission to return, and live in peace with their own nation, and their nation cannot complain or object to this. There is but one point at which the natives of Florida can be concentrated, without weakening the borders of Florida too much, and that is, on the banks of the Appalachicola adjoining the southern boundary of Alabama and Georgia, and running down the river on both sides so as to include a sufficient area for the real natives of that country. This might infringe a little upon the large grant to Forbes and Co."" but it would be better thus, than leave St. Augustine and Pensacola exposedâ€”There a white settlement would be interposed between them and the sea shore, and the Georgia and Alabama settlements in their rear, would insure peace with them. I have thought proper to make this suggestion for the consideration of the President, and I am sure it will give general satisfaction to the Indians, if Congress will lay off a boundary for them where I have suggested; but still, I am of opinion, from the smalness of their numbers, and the shape of the Floridas that it would be much better policy to move them all up, and amply provide for them by an annuity. I have directed the chiefs to send the talk required to this place, it will follow me and I can send it on to the President through you, and as soon as it is received, the President can take such an order upon it as he may deem most proper. I have assured them that he will either send an agent to give them a talk, or invite the chiefs to Washington; they are content either way, but expressed a wish that they might be invited to proceed to the City of Washingtonâ€”on the latter course being adopted, it would be well that they should be there when Congress is in Session, and that Congress should pass the law whilst they are there. Neamothla requested, that Isaae Stephen Richards might be his Interpreter, to hold the talks with the other tribes, that he had hired him to come here, and hoped I would request his father the President that he would pay him for it: I answered, that I would make it known to his father the President, and I had but little doubt he would order Mr Richards to be paid for coming here with him; that I approved his selecting M Richards as Interpreter, and would make it known to his Father. I hope this request may be granted; I have furnished them with provisions, paid their tavern bill, and gave them one dollar to pay their passage across the Bayâ€”they have left me in a good humour and well satisfied. Referring to my last letter with which this is enclosed, â€I gave you some information of the attempt of Dexter and Wonton to establish themselves on the Alatchua plains under a Spanish grant; to give you further information on this subject I enelese send you an extract of a letter to me from a gentleman of high standing and character who has visitted that country,â€ and in whose veracity every confidence may be placed. When Congress meets, every care ought to be taken by law to put down all such fraudulent Spanish Grants, of which there will be found hundreds, and in the meantime to protect the title when possession is had agreeably to the Spanish Law, and in no other case whatever ought titles to be made valid. Mr George I. Brown of Baltimore son of Doctor Brown of that place, has lately explored the country on the St Johns River; he returns to Baltimore, is intelligent and can give a very satisfactory account of things as they are there, is of a good character, is about to move to the Floridas, and if the Government has any use for an Agent, in him, from letters to me it will find a faithful and capable agent. From the information of Capt Bell, I am fearful that Mr Penneers will not answer the expectations of the Government. Extract, before alluded to, â€œIn compliance with your wish I herewith place before you such information of the Alatchua country as I became acquainted with during my residence in East Florida. In the month of April last, I proceeded to the S"" Johns accompanied by Horatio Dexter to his residence six miles south of Lake Georgeâ€” On our arrival we found the gentleman who took charge of the establishment during M* Dexters absence extremely unwell, and at the urgent solicitation of M. Dexter I agreed to remain a short time as it was necessary for him to accompany the chiefs of the Seminoles to St Augustine, whose object was to ascertain from Govâ€ Coppinger what provisions were made for them by the Spanish Government, and to be informed ef by what title the whites had taken possession and were forming settlements in the Alatchua country. The chiefs Pond Governor, Coosa, Taskchee and two others whose names I do not recollect visitted the Governor who informed them that the title to the Alatchua was granted by the Cap"" Gen"" of Cuba to a M* Aredondo a resident of St Augustine. Alatchua is represented as a very fertile district, and as an inducement to settlers the proprietors M* Wonton, Dexter, Aredondo and Mitchell * have offered fifty acres of land to those who may agree to reside there. M* Wonton who is well known among the Seminoles and who has great influence among them has established a store for the supply of the Indians. In May last, the chiefs met M* Wonton and Dexter, and held a talk with them, and at the same time recognised the right of the proprietors to the grant, stipulating also that a store properly supplied with essentials should be Kept in the Alatchuaâ€.â€” I shall leave this early in October to carry my family home; but should information make it necessary for my return I will do so, not otherwise.

BELL,ACTING GOVERNOR WORTHINGTON (EAST FLORIDA),"SIR, Lieut Colonel Eustis has placed in my hands two communications from you of this date,â€ addressed to him as commanding United States Troops in S Augustine; one covering a letter from the City. Council of Sâ€™ Augustine, stating that â€œunless another place be procured, if the present Council-Chamber is to be taken possession of by the United States Troops, they must relinquish their commissionsâ€. The other enclosed â€œa Resolution of the Board of health of this City of this date requesting the removal of the Hospital from the Centre of this City. My letter of this date addressed to his Honor the Mayor is signed officially as Capt commanding; â€ which the Committee appointed by the Council, submitted to you with theirs, I am at a loss to divine the reason of your addressing Col'Eustis as commanding, unless you would believe me capable of imposing a communication on the Mayor under an official Signature, unauthorised or assumed.â€”The Colonel's reply to your communications above alluded to * will satisfy you, that I have yet the honor to Command â€œthe detachment stationed at Fort St Marksâ€. On your arrival in this City, you found me provisionally acting as Secretary of the Province, vested with all the powers of the late Governor Coppinger, by a commission from Gen' Jackson Governor of the Provinces; from me you received all the instruments, documents, ordinances and instructions for your information and Government, which had come into my possession from the American commissioner, and Governor Jacksonâ€”In none of them do you find any authority given you, or the City-Council to take possession of, or in any way to occupy the public property and edifices, on the contrary you find by the American Commissioner's letter dated 11* July addressed to meâ€ where he says â€œThe establishment of the Pilots will necessarily meet your attention, and you will make such disposition of the Public-property until you receive formal instructions as will best secure it from injury having regard to the circumstances in which some of it is placed by Settlers Occupying it, under the permission of the Spanish Authoritiesâ€.â€”When the City Council was about to be organized under your Jurisdiction, the Key of the door of the Council Chamber (as it is styled) was delivered to his Honor the Mayor with a perfect understanding that it could be occupied for the use of the Corporation until it became necessary to remove the troops from the Fort, which I anticipated must take place in consequence of the dampness of the Casemates occupied by them and a want of a circulation of air and I am confident of having named my apprehensions to you on that subject as well as to most of the members composing the Councilâ€”This same building was occupied by the Spanish Troops on our taking possession; and was afterwards occupied by the Same Company now ordered to it from the fort. Now by what right you or the City Council you have to Occupy that Edifice to the exclusion of the Military I leave to you to shew, for I do assure you so long as I have the honor to Command â€œthe System which has been adopted hereâ€ will be â€œstill persisted in respecting the public propertyâ€ until otherwise directed by the proper Authority.â€”An appeal to the President of the United States if founded in fact, cannot Shew a want of respect on our part to the â€œCivil powersâ€.â€”And I assure you, althoâ€™ I have been Styled a â€œyoung officerâ€ that Such a threat does not alarm one, who has served his Country from the Burning sands of Louisina to the frozen Banks of the St Lawrence within the last twelve years. The Board of health, it will be recollected is composed of the City Council with the addition of a Doctor Stone who is resident Physician of this Cityâ€”This resolution after the letter addressed to you, of the same date on the subject of the Council Chamber being about to be Occupied by the Troops exhibits a feeling and disposition on the part of that honorable body, which I am truly sorry to seeâ€”â€œtaking into connectionâ€ the two Documents produced by the same body and both growing out of the letter addressed by me to the Mayor informing him of the necessity of our Occupying the building Known as the â€œNational Schoolâ€ certainly evinces a disposition hostile to the Military on this Station, and that evidently countenanced in your communications now before me. For you not only fully sanction the measures proposed by this seemingly irritated Council, but you use threats which we are not accustomed to hear from officers in your responsible situationâ€”That the present situation of the hospital â€œis Contrary to the salubrity thereof and injurious to the health and Conforts of the inhabitantsâ€ or that a malignant fever exists there, requires more proof in my opinion than the mere opinion of the board of healthâ€” Some facts should be stated of the existence of malignant disease among the Soldiers in hospital before it can be removed, as also that it is injurious to the health and comfort of the inhabitants, have they Complained? I apprehend notâ€”One Soldier only has died in the hospital since this place has been occupied by the United States Troops, and that death Occurred shortly after our landingâ€”does this look like malignant disease? the disease I fear as far as it respects the hospital, was only imaginary with the Honble the Council.â€” I call on you as the patron and protector of the Charity Society of this City to provide some Suitable place for reception of the persons, objects, who from misfortune or otherwise are obliged to ask Assistance from that Society, and have been received into the Army hospital; the illiberal to say the least of it report of the Board of health makes it necessary for us to prohibit any other patients in the hospital than those of the Army * Under a firm conviction that â€œthe Systemâ€ I have pursued will meet the approbation of my Superiors I have the Honor to Subscribe myself Yours very respectfully Signed JN"" R.

"NA:OIA, SW Lets. Sent, Bk. E",Correspondence,THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO JOHN R. BELL,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,JOHN R. BELL,"CAPTAIN JNÂ° R BELL St Augustine SIR, I have received your letters of the 3"" Sept** & 28 August ' with their enclosures, in relation to the Indians in Florida. It would seem from your Statement as well as from other Sources of information that the Seminole Indians have been most shamefully imposed on and barbarously treated both by the Creek Indians and unprincipled individuals. As little as their past conduct has entitled them to the kindness of the U States, now they have been brought under their protection the government will extend towards them the same justice and generosity which it always has towards the other Indian tribes within our limits. It is unfortunate that the sickness of M. Penieres has prevented him from reporting personally to General Jackson so as to have had the advantage of his orders in discharge of his duties as Sub Agent. It will be now impracticable for him to report personally to him as he will leave Pensacola for Nashville about the begining of next month; and it will be necessary that some one should be appointed under whose instruction his duties may be performed. Having every confidence in your good Sense you have been Selected for that purpose, and I have enclosed to you a temporary appointment as Agent; and M. Penieres has been directed to report to you for orders and directed to submit his accounts and disbursements to you for approval.â€ You will with as little delay as practicable repair to the Seminole Indians to be accompanied by the Sub agent and ascertain their actual condition and disposition towards the U States. For this purpose you are authorized to convene the chiefs, and if you should deem it advisable, the Warriors and explain to them fully their present relation to the U States and their intention towards them. The U States consider them under their protection & will extend towards them, if they demean themselves peaceably, the same justice and liberality, that they have done to other tribes within their limits; and have viewed with great disapprobation the injustice and imposition, which has been practised on them by unprincipled individuals. They particularly regret the conduct of the party of Creeks, who lately made a plundering excursion into their Country and of which the Creek Agent has been informed. Should they attempt to repeat their excursion they will be held responsible for the consequence. The government expects that the Slaves who have run away or been plundered from our Citizens or from Indian tribes within our limits will be given up peaceably by the Seminole Indians when demanded through the Agent and satisfactory proof made of the fact. You will ascertain their opinion of the extent of Country held by them, and on what condition they hold it, and without stating the ultimate determination of the Government urge on them the propriety on their own account, either to join the Creeks who I understand will receive them, or to concentrate their people in one place and become peaceable and industrious farmers. The former would be more for their interest, and it is hoped they may make Some arrangements with the Creeks, for that purpose, which, if they do, the Government will agree to make them such indemnity for the lands and improvements which they own in Florida as may be just. I will refer you to the instructions of M* Penieresâ€ and Gen' Jackson * of which I enclose you Copies, as an additional illustration of the views of the government in relation to these Indians. It is, I find indespensible to their quiet that unprincipled traders and other individuals be removed from among them. None have a right to remain without your license or that of the Governor; and you will notify such individuals whom you may find living among them of the necessity of obtaining license and will remove such as do not obtain them within a reasonable period to be prescribed by you, taking care to grant them only to those in whose character you may confide. The notoriously bad you will cause to be removed without delay. I perceive by the letter of Dexter that he appears to act by a power delegated to him by the Seminole Indians."" Neither he or any other can exercise such delegated authority with out the sanction of the Government. Correct information is desired from any source, but the Indians must be made to understand that no one has a right to exercise authority for them but such as the government may appoint. Such opposition of authority is one of the means by which unprincipled individuals are enabled to fleece these poor ignorant creatures; and it is proper to observe without forming any opinion as to his Character, that it has been stated that Dexter is one of those individuals who has been speculating on the Indians both in the purchase of Negroes and pretended purchases in land. You will give the Sub agent such special instructions as you may judge proper, reporting the same to this Department. You will find him intelligent and not wholly destitute of a knowledge of the Indian Character among whom he has resided for several years and if properly supported by your authority and orders will be very useful. The place of his residence will be of some importance, and you will report to this Department at what point it ought to be fixed with your reasons for the same. I furnish you with a list,"" (one from Col: Arbuckle"" & the other from the Creek Agent"") of Negroes taken from the Seminole Indians by a party of Creeks; by which it would seem that many of them belong to the Inhabitants of Florida. I have referred the subject to the President and have directed the Agent to hold them in his possession till further orders which when received will be communicated to you. You will be reimbursed your necessary expenses in performing the duties which have been assigned to you as agent, and will be allowed at the rate of three dollars a day while actually engaged. You will render your Accounts properly certified and supported by the necessary vouchers to this Department for settlement and when absent from your post on the duties of your Agency, will duly report the same to the proper Officer. I have transmitted One thousand Dollars in account to meet the disbursements which may be necessary. It is confidently expected that your energy and good sense, will speedily afford to the Seminole Indians that protection and sense of security which they appear to stand in so much need of and that your report will furnish full and satisfactory information in relation to their situation and disposition I have &"" J C.

I herewith enclose you a Commission * investing you with all the Civil, judicial and military powers heretofore exercised by the Governor of W. Florida under the Spanish authority, at the date of the late Treaty with Spainâ€”referring you also, to the case decided as to Jurisdiction in the case Vidal's Heirs vs John Innerarity.â€ In administering the Govt. of West Florida, you will be governed by my instructions from the President of the U. States which you will gather from my Commission as Gov' of the Floridas &"" &"" &"", bearing date the 10"" day of March, my third Commission: of date 20"" March 1821. and from the instructions given by the Secretary of State to me under them, all of which you have recorded in the Book containing the Executive proceedings, and which is in your possession as Secretary of West Florida, & such other instructions as you may receive from me on this subject. Your are well apprized of the cause that gave rise to my Proclamation * ordering certain Spanish Officers to withdraw themselves from the Territories of the Floridas, agreeably to what they were required under the 7"" Article of the Treaty, by which they were bound to have withdrawn themselves within six months after the Exchange of the Ratification thereof. This order has been limited to those who have been guilty of the Contemptâ€”should others who are not included, behave indecorously, and contemptuously to the existing authorities, you will forthwith order them from the Floridas. It must not be permitted, that foreign Officers remain here disturbing the harmony of society, alienating the quiet citizens of this Country from their allegiance to the Government, and treating that Government with contempt, which now exists in the Floridas. Should those Officers included in my Proclamation attempt to return without permission, you will forthwith confine them until they can be sent away; and should Col Callava return to this place in my absence, you will order him immediately to withdraw himself, as he was bound to do under the Treaty, but which he has failed to doâ€”his conduct here in exciting disquietude amongst the peaceful citizens and Creolesâ€” the false oath he has taken, and his contemptuous conduct to the Administrators of the Government, make it necessary and proper that if he does return, he should be forthwith ordered to depart, and should he refuse, that he be imprisoned for the contempt, until he peaceably agrees to withdraw himself, as he was bound to do under the 7* Article of the Treaty. I have the fullest confidence, that you will administer the Government with that energy, which the peace, harmony and the protection of the Citizens and Creoles of the Country require & which is necessary to secure to the people ceded with the Country, all the rights and privileges secured to them under the late Treaty with Spain. Should it come to your knowledge that any documents or papers relating to the private property of the people in the Floridas, are about to be carried off, you will cause them to be delivered to the Office of the Alcalde for safe keeping. This being one of the important rights secured to them under the Treaty, must be carried into effect, regardless of the standing of the individual who may attempt to deprive them of this security of the right of property, guaranteed by the Treaty, and which may be attempted to be violated. As I have directed the Secretary of East Florida, to transmit here, all his reports, you will please open, read and forward to me such as you may deem necessary and important, to such places as my memorandum directs, calculating on my speedy return to this place, on being informed of any emergency that may make my presence necessary, and all Official letters from the Heads of Departments, you will please open, read, copy, and forward me the Originals, and all private letters you will forward to Nashville unopened.â€â€” I am Sir, with great respect Yr Obd Humble Servt.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, VIII:LS*",Correspondence,GOVERNOR JACKSON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,GOVERNOR JACKSON,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR, I have received your letter of the 20"" of August last * in answer to my several letters of the 16** 17th * & 18th of July * which you are pleased to inform me you have transmitted to the President of the U. States at Shonnondale Springs. You request me to communicate to you as early as possible, and as fully as may be in my power, such information as may serve to enlighten the enquiries of Congress on the different subjects which will require the attention of that body in relation to the Floridas, at their next session. After giving this important subject the attention which it merits, and refering to the various laws which you have been pleased to notice in your letter, I proceed to lay before you such information as I have been able to collect and as I conceive to be within the scope of your enquiries, together with such reflections as suggest themselves to my mind. As a subject of the first importance at the present juncture, I must refer you to my letter to the Secretary of War of the 17th Instant.â€ You will find from that communication that the Indians are spread over the whole of East, and part of West Florida. From the talk I have had with some of their chiefs who visited me some time ago, and forwarded with the letter just mentioned, the places at present occupied by them, has been ascertained with tolerable accuracy; that is as far as the wandering habits of these people will permit them to be considered as occupying any place. For the greater part, these Indians consist of those who fled from the Upper Creeks in 1814, and adhering to our enemies continued at war with us until subdued in 1818, since which time they have remained in the Floridas. I am clearly of opinion that they ought to be ordered up to their old places of abode within the Creek nation, as they can have no rightful claim to lands or country within the Floridas. As to those who have been born and raised within the Floridas, it is absolutely necessary that they should be collected at one point, and secured in their settlements by act of Congress, in case they cannot be prevailed upon to unite with the Creek nation, to which they originally belonged; this latter course is very desirable for their own safety, as well as dictated to us by sound policy. They might be there completely protected by our Government, they may be provided for by an annuity, or by such other mode, as Congress in its wisdom may devise, adequate to their wants, and to induce them to embrace an agricultural life. Sould the Indians prefer continuing within the Floridas it will be expedient for the safety of our frontier on the seacost, to concentrate them on the Appalachecola river immediately adjoining the Southern boundary of Georgia and Alabama, on both sides of the river and downward so as to include a sufficient area for them. By this means a sufficient white population may be interposed between them and the seaboard, and afford a settlement strong enough to cover and protect St. Augustine and Pensacola, as well as the Peninsula of Florida. By referring to the talk already mentioned, you will see that the difficulty of collecting the native Indians of the Floridas, to the point on the Appelachecola, will not be great. They are rejoiced to hear that a country will be allowed them to live in at all, such has been their apprehensions of their future fate since the transfer of their country to the United States, excited no doubt by mischievous advisers; and they will be still more so, to find that they will be fostered and protected by the American Government. I have been long impressed with the absurdity of entering into Treaties with the Indian tribes residing within our territorial limits, subject to our jurisdiction and to such laws as Congress may pass for their security, happiness, and safety. I therefore respectfully recommend to the consideration of the President whether it will not be proper to suggest to Congress the propriety of laying off a tract of country for them, and fixing a boundary between them and the settlement of the Whites. It is well known to me from experience and observation that more general justice can be done the Indians by the legislative provisions of Congress than by treaties: the poor can be better taken care of and more equal justice done the whole. I have constantly observed that in Indian treaties the Chiefs are fattened and the common Indian left to starve. Another and a very important reason for adopting the policy I have recommended, is the great obstacle which will otherwise exist to the surveying and bringing the public lands into market, which I presume is intended to be done as speedily as possible. The next subject which presents itself is the form of territorial Government proper to be adopted for the Floridas This must be in a great measure adopted to the geographical form and the character of the soils. The principal body of land capable of supporting a considerable population lies nearly east and west, from the Choctahatchy to the Alatchua and St. Johns, being about thirty miles in width by about three hundred in length, and partly in East, and partly in West Florida. The Peninsula has been very little explored, but from the best information I can obtain I am inclined to think, that excepting immediately on the margin of the river St. Johns there is no extensive body of good land in any part of it, although it is possible that some good soil may be found in small quanties, in particular places. With these exceptions, the Floridas consist of Pine Woods and swamps. If the lower part of the Peninsula, were not as I believe it to be, capable of supporting only a very small population, the geographical shape of the Floridas would be extremely inconvenient. But as it is there will only be a disproportion between the length and breadth, but not such as to render it unfit for our territorial Government. Pensacola is at one of these extremes and St. Augustine at the other. The center of the future population of the Floridas will be some where about the Suwaney, which is a fine river and flows through a country of good land. The Okafanoke swamp represented on the maps as near the heads of this river and of the Wachulla & St. Marks, has no real existance as was ascertained by me in 1818, when I marched through the country and found the swamp as represented to be the Mickasukey pond or Lake, in the midst of a very healthy fertile country, and which has been settleing very rapidly. It may be well to observe that the present maps only tend to deceive and mislead. Before Congress can enter upon the subject of a separation of the Floridas into two territories, the question of the location of the Indians must first be settled. If they be concentrated at the point proposed I would recommend that the Floridas be made but one territory, and I feel perfectly satisfied with such an arrangement, two or three years would give a sufficient population to the Floridas to form a State Government. Should a separation take place this object will be long deferred if not entirely defeated, and may produce the necessity of uniting West Florida to Alabama, which if done will of course occasion the annexation of East Florida to Georgia. The whole, if no subdivision takes place, will in a few years constitute one of the most respectable States in this part of the Union, will exceed Louisiana in population and rival it in wealth, but if seperated into two territories the population of neither will suffice. As far as I have been able to ascertain the wishes of the people of West Florida, they appear to be against the annexation to Alabama, and from what I can learn, the same sentiment prevails in East Florida with respect to Georgia. The best interests of the Floridas in my opinion require that they should be united under one territorial Government, with an eye to a speedy admission into the union as a state, by this means a great saving will be made to the U. States in maintaining two distinct territorial Governments for an uncertain period of time. The vicinity of the Suwany river possesses many advantages for the location of the seat of Government: it is equally central to the country East of the St. Johnsâ€”the Escambia and Florida point; over and above the advantages of being situated in the center of a beautiful lime stone country. I am of opinion, taking into view the mixed population likely to exist here for some time, that the form of the territorial Government ought to be simple and energetic. The territorial organization, in the first grade of Government, adopted for the Louisiana territory, with some alterations to suit local circumstances, may answer the purpose. The Spanish population forming but a small proportion, it is of very little importance to preserve any of their ancient laws and customs; the sooner they become American the better. The lands and the land titles of the Floridas require the most serious attention of Congress. It is a subject of the greatest importance to the Government and ought to receive the earliest consideration. Whilst the honest grantee may be protected in his rights, the greatest pains should be taken to exclude the numerous fraudulent and antidated claims, founded on no possession, at the time of issuing the grant or concession, and without any original record or survey in West Florida that has yet been discovered. Nearly all these grants commence in 1817, by petition to the Governor for an order of survey or location, and in every instance the other parts of the title are completed from 1818 to 1821. For some years past, from all I can learn this has been a trading business with the Officers of the Spanish Government both here and at St. Augustine. The stranger was accosted in the streets and offered a grant for a Doubloon or some trifle. The petition only has the appearance of being original, but in most instances in all probability antedated, the other documents attached to it, are only certified copies from the archives in the keeping of Pintado the Surveyor General at Havanna, and who is even now making out official certificates of those papers to be evidence here, a kind of impudence and imposture at which congress will no doubt be indignant. Before the year 1817 there was scarcely any such thing as a grant of land excepting in the immediate vicinity of this place, and I presume that in East Florida, the number was also very inconsiderable. They were made I believe, merely with a view to the change of governments, and with no intention of settling. A provision similar to that contained in the 14"" Sect of the act of the 20"" December 1803, * declaring all incomplete grants not commenced before 1816, and not accompanied by settlement as null and void, would at once put an end to the whole of the fraudulent grants. As to the enormous grants in different parts of the Floridas it is not necessary for me to speak, but I am pretty certain that if all are sanctioned it will take a country twice as large as the Floridas to gratify them. The extract of a letter from M Brown a gentleman of respectability from Baltimore herewith enclosed, "" will shew that a grant has been made since the 24* January 1818, by the Captain General of Cuba to Arredondo for a large tract in the Alachua plains, and which I have evry reason to believe is fraudulent. I would therefore recommend that Congress should declare void all grants for land, not founded on actual possession before the 22"" February 1816, * Jackson was in error. There was no Congressional act of any description enacted on the date mentioned. Undoubtedly the allusion was to an act approved Mar. 26, 1804 (Terr. Papers, Orleans, Ix, 202â€“213; 2 STAT. 283â€“289), the fourteenth article of which provided for a time limit for the reception of claims based on Spanish titles. and in like manner declaring void all grants not bottomed on a concession regularly made agreeably to the Spanish law, and possession taken and continued, and improvements made thereon in strict conformity to the Spanish regulations making such exceptions as will secure his settlement &c, to the individual who shall have had five years continued possession, prior to the 24"" day of January 1818. In referring to the numerous acts of Congress for the adjustment of the land titles in the different territories, I find very little that is applicable at present to the Floridas, excepting the act of the 21"" April 1806,â€ the first section of which defines that no grant shall be valid, unless founded on possession, commencing with and continued under the concession by the proper officer of Spain. The greatest difficulty appears to be in the establishment of a board of Commissioners. A great variety of plans have been fallen upon. The first consisting of three Commissioners, Secretary, Register, recorder, was found too expensive and dilatory, the last adopted for the Country East of the Mississippi was too simple and too cheap; two districts were formed and a single Commissioner appointed to each with a Clerk who was expected to discharge all the functions of recorder and translator.â€ This may have answered a very good purpose in Mississippi and Alabama, but much more difficult and important legal questions will arise here; and I do not hesitate to say that the Commissioners for the settlement of the land titles ought to be men of the first legal talents, of strict integrity, and I would add as an essential requisite, possessing no landed interest in the Floridas. Persons will be recommended from this place who ought not to be appointed. There are but few titles which are clear of dispute, and when a man has bought a title under disputed circumstances, it is very natural that self interest, and the interest of his friends, will have great weight in his mind, and precedents will be established to ensure their validity. I do not go too far when I say that no person should be appointed who has bought a land claim in the Floridas. It cannot be too strongly impressed on the mind of the President, that men of talents and strict integrity, who have no interest in landed property in the Floridas, should be selected as commissioners to settle the land titles. It is of great importance that the Judiciary should be filled by men of first rate legal talents and unimpeached integrity, as much will depend upon those who are employed to lay the foundation of any system. Respectability will be given to the government by appointing men possessing weight of character, they ought to be well acquainted with the civil law, and the maritime law, as well as the common law. 412 STAT. 391-395. The same court might have chancery powers given to it, on the plan of the circuit courts of the U. States, and I think ought to be required to hold its terms more frequently, than has been usual, or to hold adjourned courts from time to time as business may require. I consider the Judiciary as by far the most important branch of the territorial Government; persons should be selected whose unexceptionable character will be a pledge that they will stear clear of the influence of corruption of any kind or partiality. To the high character of the distributers of justice from the bench, will be attached that confidence, indespensable in all well regulated governments. It is the purity of this branch of the administration, which secures to the citizen, the peaceful enjoyment of his constitutional rights and privileges, and awards a speedy punishment to those who violate the law and trample upon the rights of others. I forward you printed copies of the ordinances * as they may perhaps contain something, deserving of being permanently incorporated in the act of Congress organizing the territorial government.""

M. Gouverneur"" who left us yesterday with our daughter for New York, will inform you, of our state, which is favorable. The discussions in Florida, will require some direction, or at least notice, from the Executive, & on the questions, of law, growing out of the conduct of the parties, an opinion from you.â€ Presuming this to be the case, it will be useful for you to have the whole subject before you, that you may, when called on, be ready to act. The enclosed papers contain, I believe, all that has passed between them.â€ Return them to me, after giving them a thorough examination. According to my recollection, of our construction of the law, when we had it under consideration, and took the measures which placed the parties in their present stations, as to use a military phrase, on the present battle-ground, it was considerd, that the Spanish laws, civil, judicial, & military, heretofore exercised by the officers of Spain, should remain in force, & be exercised, by the Governor & those acting under him in regard to the internal governm"" of the provinces in such manner, as the Executive should direct, untill a temporary gov"", should be regularly organized over those territories: that the laws relating to revenue & the slave trade, were those only, of the U States, which even for the present, extended to those territories, and for the execution of which, a district judge, was appointed, at Pensacola, & another at S*Augustine. If this view is correct, it follows, that the district judges have nothing to do, with the internal gov"" of the provinces, or with any concern, other than, simply, the revenue & slave trade. Under the laws of Spain, I believe, there is no such writ, as that of H. Corpus, so that, if the power of a D. Judge, was not limited, as above stated, M. Fromentin would have had no right to grant it. The inquisition & military despotism, are completely at variance, with the principles, on which that writ is founded. On no view therefore that I have yet taken of the subject, had he any right, to interfere. That the Govâ€™ may have displayed some degree of zeal & warmth, & have executed the Spanish powers, too much in the Spanish way, makeing no nice distinction, according to the principles of our system, between the appropriate duties of the several departments of the gov"", * Samuel L. Gouverneur, the President's secretary and son-in-law. Executive, Judiciary, &cc, considering them all blended in himself, & taken that character, which best suited the occasion, of Judge, for example, to call Col: Calava before him, & make him disgorge the papers, which he unjustly withheld, & of combining all together, in overruling the H. corpus, & summoning the D. J."" before him, is in accord in point of energy, with what we have known of him in other occurrences. But it is for us to enquire, whether the law justifies, what he did, & whether the power thus exercised, was exerted, in a good cause, & produced good If there was no right, in the judge to issue the writ, the expression of that sentiment by the Executive, settles that question, which is all that is depending, between the Gov"" and the judge. Whether it will be proper to with hold the nomination of Mr Fr: * is another question. This new bar, is divided on that point. They constitute themselves [by the bye]"" a bar, before there is any court, and remonstrate, against the appointment of a judge, who alone, could form a court.

Col EUSTIS, Comm"" at S*Augustine, SIR, Since our arrival in town, we have not ascertained in whom is vested the charge of Indian affairs for the United States but under the impression that this is a subject embraced within your duties we take the liberty of addressing ourselves directly to you. The late treaty between Spain and the United States found the Seminole Indians disposed to forget former causes of enmity to the United States a change of feeling which we had greatly contributed to produce. This favourable disposition we laboured to improve so successfully that nothing is now more desired by them than an understanding with the United States. To the greatest distrust has succeeded no small confidence in the justice and generosity of the United States. Capt. Bell with whom we have constantly communicated, * has probably informed you of the means taken to tranquilize their fears and their wishes to enter as speedily as possible into an arrangement finally settling their future relations with the United States, And our principal object is to state that the Chiefs have vested in us the power to make for them a Treaty, this duty we will discharge alone or in concert. If you are prepared to take advantage of a disposition now eminently favourable to this object we are ready to enter immediately on the business, if not we respectfully suggest that the appointment of an agent without delay is of the utmost consequence and if it be consistent with the views of the President we would recommend Capt. Bell who has acquired the confidence of the indians an object of no small consideration in treating with a race of men so diffident of their own skill in diplomacy and so little used to civilized modes of conducting national affairs.â€”In forming a decision on this subject it ought not to be forgotten that the present is the moment and this the mode of securing to the United States upon principles just both to themselves and others of very important interests having but little apparent connexion with the Indians.

LC:Monroe Papers:ALS,Correspondence,THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE PRESIDENT,THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,THE PRESIDENT,"MY DEAR SIR. I have read with great attention the papers you sent me on Sunday,â€ touching the controversy between Gov. Jackson & Judge Fromentin, and according to your instruction, now return them. You will find with them a number of The Enquirer, in which there is a report of the case extracted from The Floridian, as tried before the Governor, on a plea to his jurisdiction. I do not think that in this report the case is placed on it's true ground. The objection of the new constitution of the Cortes is repelled, by the decision, on the ground that after the original signing of the treaty, or at least after it's ratification by the King of Spain, the provinces are to be considered as territories of the U.S. which could not be affected by any political revolution ef in Spain, or any extension of the principles of that revolution to her colonies. Admit this to be true, and that Spain could not, after those periods; legislate for the Floridas, the Congress of the U. S. could: and congress did legislate for them by the act of the 3"" March 1821,â€ â€œto carry into effect the treaty between the U.S. and Spain,â€ by the 2"" section of which it is enacted â€œthat until &"" &"" all the military, civil and judicial powers exercised by the officers of the existing government of the same territories, shall be vested in such person and persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the President of the U.S. shall direct, for the maintaining the inhabitants of sâ€ territories in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion; and the laws of the U.S. relating to the revenue and it's collection (subject to the modification of the 15"" article of the treaty) and the laws relating to the importation of persons of colour, shall be extended to the said territories.â€ The government then which congress adopted for the Floridas, is the spanish form of government as it existed in actual operation on the 3 March 1821. The policy of the provision was, manifestly, to render the disrupture of those provinces, from the Spanish authority, as little violent, painful and inconvenient to the inhabitants as possible, by causing the government, as it stood, to slide, as it were, off the shoulders of the Spanish officers on those of our officers. So that the reason as well as the letter of the act of Congress point to that form of Spanish government which was in actual operation on the 3 march 1821, as the government intended to be adopted and continued. If then Judge Fromentin is correct in the assertion that the people of Florida had sworne to the constitution of the Cortes 16 months before he wrote, still unless the new constitution was that which the Spanish officers were actually administering at the date of our act, it is not the government adopted by congress. Now we learn from the statement of facts detailed in the opinion of the court in this report that it is questionable whether the constitution of the Cortes had even been proclaimed in the Floridas at the date of our act. I understand it as unquestionable that this new constitution of government had not been actually organized at this date. The powers then, as distributed by it, were not those powers military, civil and judicial â€œexercised by the officers of the existing governmentâ€ were het the pewers which congress directed to be transferred to officers appointed under the authority of the President: and hence the constitution of the Cortes had nothing to do with the question of Governor Jackson's judicial powers. These were to be decided solely by the character and extent of the powers actually exercised by the Spanish Governor of Florida on the 3 March 1821. I understand it to be conceded, that the Spanish Governor did, at that time, possess and exercise the judicial powers claimed and exercised by Governor Jackson in the case of Vidal; and hence I think it very clear that Governor Jackson, whose commission put him precisely in the shoes of the Spanish Governor, rightfully claimed and exercised those powers. With regard to Judge Fromentin his appointment and commission would have been unnecessary and improper if congress had stopped at the adoption of the Spanish system: because such a judge would have been an anomaly in that system and could have found no functions apposite to his commission. But congress having added to the Spanish System, our revenue and Slave laws, the appointment of a judge became indispensible for the performance of the judicial functions expressly designated and required by those laws. The purpose of his appointment marks out the extent of his powers; they are limited to the enforcement of the revenue & slave laws; and he cannot go beyond these limits without invading the province of those who, under the authority of congress, were administering the Spanish system which as to Judge Fromentin was a foreign system and as to him as completely extra: territorial as the system then administered in Cuba or old Spain. Judge Fromentin defends his authority to issue a writ of habias corpus, in this case, under the 14"" section of the Judiciary act of 1789.â€ This section enacts â€œthat all the before mentioned courts of the U.S. shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions and agreable to the principles and usages of law.â€ So far, the section has been construed by the Supreme court as confining the power to issue these writs to cases in which they may be necessary for the exercise of some branch of the jurisdiction given by other sections of this law to the federal courts; not as an original, seperate and independent authority to issue these writs; but to issue them only in cases in which they may be necessary as the auxiliaries to give effect to some other branch of their jurisdiction. Judge Fromentin for example had a jurisdiction limited to two subjects: the revenue & slave laws: if in any trial before Judge Fromentin's court, the testimony of either of the persons committed by Gov"" Jackson had been necessary, Judge Fromentin would have had a right to issue a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, because such writ would have been necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction: but in the case which has occurred, it is not alledged and indeed cannot be, that any such necessity existed for the writ. The section, however, goes on to provideâ€”â€œthat either of the Judges of the Supreme Court as well as judges of the District courts shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of the commitment. Provided that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol, unless where they are in custody under or by color of the authority of the U.S. or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.â€â€”Now if Congress had declared the laws of the U. S. generally, or this act, specially, to be in force in Florida, at the same time that they declared the Spanish System in force, (if such a chaos may be supposed for argument's sake) Judge Fromentin, on the naked representation that these persons were illegally confined under colour of the authority of the U. S. (the representation being made according to legal usage) would have had the power to issue his writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of the commitment; but as soon as upon this enquiry he had ascertained that they had been committed for a contempt by the seperate and at least co-ordinate tribunal which was administering the Spanish system of laws, he could not have taken another step in that direction but would have been constrained to quash his writ & remand the prisoners. If instead of ascertaining this state of things, on the return of the habeas corpus, it had been made known to him in the first instance and had been relied on as the ground of application for the writ, he would not have been authorised to issue it: for this writ is never issued upon a statement which if true would not authorise a discharge. Now this as I take it is the case which really occurred. Judge Fromentin was informed that another, a seperate & independent tribunal over which he had no control and with which he had no more connexion than he had with the courts of Cuba or of Spain, had committed these persons for a contempt of it's authority; Suppose on the return of the habeas corpus these facts had appeared to be true, could he have discharged these persons? He certainly could not unless he possessed a Supervising and controlling power over the acts of the other tribunal which can scarcely be pretended; and since he could not discharge, the habeas corpus ought not to have been awarded. This, even if this general authority as to habeas corpus had been extended to Florida: as it was not, the writ was wholly improper. Judge Fromentin proceeded I have no doubt very honestly but on a mistake both of Governor Jackson's powers & his own: he thought that Judge Gov. Jackson had no judicial power, and that he had all the judicial power which is conferred by the constitution and laws of the U. S. on a district judge. This mistake proceeded from not attending accurately to the provisions of the act of Congress of 3 March 21. He did not advert to the fact that by the force of this law and your commission under it Gov. Jackson had succeeded to all the powers military, civil & judicial of the Spanish Gov';â€”nor to the fact that he, as a Judge of the U. S. possessed the power only to execute such laws of the U. S. as had been extended by congress to these U. S. territories: that he was, consequently, a judge only to the purpose of executing the revenue & slave laws, possessing all the judicial powers necessary to the enforcement of these laws; but no more: & that consequently he had no right to interfere with Gov. J.'s discharge of the seperate mass of judicial powers, which belonged to him, and for the exercise of which he was responsible to the President, not to Judge Fromentin. This is my view of the case which I believe co: incides essentially with your own. I have thrown it out for your consideration of the ground on which I rest it, not meaning to offer it as an official opinion, nor meaning this as an official letter. With respect to Judge Fromentin, I have seen no evidence of his unfitness, which ought to induce you to with. hold his nomination from the Senate. The objection to his morals is mere report and may be slander: and I do not think this mistake with regard to the habeas corpus such a proof of incapacity as to justify your with. holding his nomination from the Senate. Judging from the papers it will be very strenously contended by a large body of editors and citizens, perhaps judges & lawyers that it was no mistake; and even if it shall be admitted to be a mistake, it will still be a very popular one. It was an error on the side of liberty; and it evinces no ordinary share of judicial courage to have followed the direction of his conscience when it brought him directly and inevitably into collision with a man of Gov. Jackson's energy. It will have an air of rather undignified fickleness to have commissioned a man as judge, whom you will not even nominate to the senate, on no better reason for the change of opinion than a tale of scandal, unsupported by proof, the remonstrance of a parcel of strangers, calling themselves the bar, whose opportunities of personal knowledge with regard to Judge Fromentin are wholly unknown and with regard to whom he says that they are utter strangers to him except one (M. Breckenridge) who accuse him in general terms of immorality & incapacity, with"" specifying the testimony on which they rest their charges or the sources from which they derive their information; or the complaints of a Gov' of Gen.' Jackson's temperament, whose irascibility is in a blaze at the slightest and most conscientious resistance to his authority. I am much surprized that Fromentin so circumstanced, with the Gov. & bar sh"" wish to hold the office; but I am by no means satisfied that a commission bestowed on full consideration, can with dignity or propriety be re.called by a President of the U. S. for no better reasons than these. There can be no doubt that there would be printers enough who would be proud of the opportunity to repeat their cry of the fear of Jackson, against the administration, and to exhibit Fromentin as a victim sacraficed, through this fear, to the fiery Moloch; and tho' I never would be deterred from taking a right step by the dread of such a construction of my motives, yet I think the real grounds ought at least to be so strong and prominent before the public as to rescue the step, with all candid men, from such injurious misconstruction; and I doubt whether this would be the case with regard to with. holding the nomination of Judge Fromentin. Besides; is it perfectly clear that you can revoke a commission which has been accepted and acted on? The Arkansaw Judge,â€ at the last session, had never entered on the duties of his commission; but, on the contrary, had continued to discharge the duties of a previous commission, in the state of his residence, long after accepting his commission for Arkansaw; these acts on his part were justly considered as a virtual resignation of this latter commission and you nominated another gentleman. But Judge Fromentin has not only accepted his commission, but gone to his appointment, organized his court & entered on the discharge of his duties: The constitution declares that commissions thus conferred shall eehtinue expire at the end of the next session of the Senate. Is it the meaning of this clause that commissions thus conferred shall abide the pleasure of the Senate only, or, was it intended to reserve to the President the opportunity of making another choice? I am not informed of the practise; but, abstractedly considered; I should regard a commission conferred by the President in the recess of the Senate as amounting, in general, to a promise that if the appointee sh"" continue as deserving, as he was at the time of his appointment, he would be nominated to the Senate. I say in general: because where the President had made an appointment under a gross deception, either as to the capacity or integrity of the appointee, the paramount duty which he owes to the public would absolve him from this implied promise to the appointee; and I sh"" consider him bound by his oath of office to name another person. But the case, I think, should be a strong one which sh"" call for this course; something better than scandalous mista tales of gallantry, personal dislikes either of Gov' or bar, or such a mistake of law as that which Judge Fromentin has committed. This is the view which I have at present, of this part of the case. Gov. Jacksons proceedings with regard to the ex:governor Callava, and Judge Fromentin may have been according to his Spanish authority of which I cannot pretend to judge. It may have been, as you say, merely an exercise of Spanish power too, much in the Spanish way. Our friend the General certainly takes to this same Spanish power as kindly as if it was natural to him: but you may rely upon it, it will require all his popularity to gild this pill. With regard to Callava (from what I suppose of Gov. Jackson's Spanish power), if he, Callava, had been merely a private individual of Spain who was about to elope with papers which, by the treaty, belonged to the Province, I should readily believe Gov. Jackson altogether right. But was Callava merely a private individual? Was he not the commissioner charged by Spain with the fulfilment of the treaty on her part; was it not in this character that he was in possession of the papers contained in those boxes which really belonged to the King of Spain:â€”As the Commissioner of Spain was he not entitled to the courtesy & respect due to the sovereign whom he represented: and if in transferring the archives & documents, he retained any which the commissioner of the other nation thought he ought to have delivered, was the question to be settled by force? Was it according to the comity of nations in such a case that the commissioner of one nation should lay violent hands on the other, and compel him to yield to his sense of his duty? That Callava did wrong, that he acted basely, if not corruptly, I have very little doubt: but still this act was done in the sacred character of of the representative of the King of Spain: it was an unfaithful execution of the treaty on the part of Spain, for which the nation was liable; it was a just ground of remonstrance to Spain: we had a right to call for these papers from her, and to exact them at as great a hazard as we chose to encounter for them: but to offer violence to the person of her representative, to seize & imprison him; and to break open the boxes containing the papers which belonged to the King his master, is, I apprehend, an act which we shall find it difficult to justify to the civilized nations of the earth. I am, it is true, not very conversant with questions of this sort;â€”but had the tables been turned on us, well I know that we should have made the welkin ring: as Shakespeare says, it would have been with as but a word & a blow and the blow would probably have come first. Now â€˜do unto others as you would they should do unto you' is just as sound a rule of action between nations as individuals. What would have satisfied us?â€”The answer to this question may afford some light as to what it is our duty to do. The proceeding against Judge Fromentin is equally indefensible. It was enough for Gov. Jackson to have refused obedience to the writ of Habeas Corpus. Fromentin had no power to enforce it. He could not practically have thwarted the Governor's course. And after refusing obedience to the writ, both the Governor and the Judge ought to have referred the question to you, & have, decorously, have abided your decision. But for the Governor of a Territory, to summon a judge of the U.S. to his tribunal to answer for the discharge of a conscientious duty, will not be tolerated by the people of this country. I verily beleive Jackson to be an honest man & a man of strong natural senseâ€”and a patriotic man tooâ€”as jealous of his country's honor as any other man living, but he knows no law except the law of force; and his want of information, combined with his violence, is perpetually plunging him & his friends into difficulties, from which it is not easy to escape without some loss of lustre. On the present occasion, if even his great popularity saves him from general execration, it will be because one of the sufferers is a Spanish tool & the other a French priest. M. Calhoun * & myself think that it will be advisable for you to come down and give this subject the direction you wish before the people, while yet the public opinion is green enough to take any bent you please. It is manifest from the public prints that the question as to the habeas corpus is not understood: but it is equally manifest from them that a storm is brewing both for Jackson & the administration unless some step shall be promptly taken to avert it. I beg you to excuse this long and rambling letter; which I have written rather for your consideration than as expression of the opinion to which I may, myself, be carried on a joint consultation. I thought it desirable that your own attention and judgment should be called to these views, and it is for this reason that I have thought it my duty to make them. I am myself perfectly persuaded that Governor Jackson's intentions have been perfeetly correct throughout the whole of this affair. His judgment too has been essentially right; for both Callava & Fromentin had done wrong; and the Governor's error, I think, consists in his having taken their punishment into his own hands. Even this error may find an apology in the undefined and unknown powers with which the act of Congress authorized him to be invested. There were, as I understand, no books to inform him of the extent and limits of the powers exercised by the Spanish Governor of the Floridas. The common impression was that they were of an arbitrary cast, and that for the enforcement of an object, intrinsically just & right, their power was almost unlimited. It was most probably in this view of the subject that he acted: & therefore I do not think that the case demands more than the disapprobation of these measures: so far as the violence offered to the person & property of the Spanish commissioner, & the warrant or citation to Judge Fromentin go. Whether a prompt and voluntary disclaimer should be tendered to the Spanish Government is a point on which I have not yet had time to think."" I thank you for your kind enquiries for my health. I have not yet recovered my strength or capacity for long continued exertionâ€”but I am in my office and working when I can. One of the properties that marks the sickness of this fall is the very slow recovery of the sufferers.â€”We called to see M* and M.â€ Gouvernier & were much gratified to learn that you were all well & to find the two young people in such health & comparative spirits. I think you might safely venture down yourself for a few days but you must not think of bringing your family nor of coming yourself permanently as yet. I beg my respects to M** Monroe in which Mâ€ W. joins meâ€”and I pray you to be assured of my friendship & devotion & Wm. WIRT [Addressed] The President of the U. States [Endorsed] Oct 11. 1821 Mr. Wirt. case of Judge Fromentinâ€” the Gov. Spanish powers, can we censure him for exercising them, in the Spanish way, especially in the furtherance of justice? If we hesitate, we may invite complaint, from the Spanish government, which ought to checked & not invited. Why has this man run to Washington? Does he expect to be presented & make complaint, specially if his minister has withdrawn, after knowing of the occurrence, without making any? Mr Jefferson referrd me to an occurrence, which he thought similar, in his adm"", the arrest of the Spanish agent who ran, with Ellicot the boundary line, at Baton rouge, & the seizure of the papers which he with held, the details of which he says may be found in Ellicots correspondence in the dep"" of State. Mr Jeffersons name, you will not mention, but the documents should be examind. I believe that Laussat the French agent was also laid hold, at N. orleans, after the surrender of Louisiana. In the instance first mentiond, M* Jefferson observ'd, that according to his recollection, the Spanish govt never complaind, knowing that its agent was in the wrong. Should I come down immediately, might I not invite complaint, & if it was supposed to be connected with the occurrence, give in consequence to it, to our disadvantage? When any movâ€™ment, is an affair of delicacy, & measures are substantially in the right train, tho' of a nature, to make even their sanction by the gov"", the ground of complaint, as in the arrest of Mr Calava, it may be with Spain, & so far as it indicates a departure from our usages, with many among ourselves, untill the affair is better understood, the longer the government holds back & declines acting the better the effect may be. I suggest these ideas for your consideration. If the laws of Spain are establishd by our law for the internal govt of the provinces, it follows, even if the district judge's jurisdiction extended the whole length, that he could not issue a writ of H. C., for such writ was never heard of, in a country where the inquisition & military despotism prevail. In every view therefore Mr Fromentin mistook his duty. I am persuaded, that so long & to such extent, has been the reign, & practice of corruption, in that country, that it will require, much energy, & decision, to root it out. A relaxd course may tend to sanction, every unprincipled claim under the preceeding governments. Its opposite, will make a stand against, & check, and as I hope suppress them.â€",1821,October,11,1821-10-11,WASHINGTON CITY,4289,1821.1011

I have had the honour of receiving your Letters of 30. July.â€ 26. August,"" and 1.

I now inclose copy of a Letter which I have by his direction written to Judge Fromentin,â€ informing him that it was understood and intended that his jurisdiction should be confined to the execution of the only Laws of the United States which by act of Congress had been extended to the Territories of Florida, namely the Laws relating to the Revenue and its collection, and the Slave trade. In the execution of these laws, which are of a nature, entirely distinct from those of Spain, operating in the Provinces, the President is of opinion that he should be amenable only to the Government of the United States. I enclose also translations of a Letter from M' Salmon Charge d'Affaires of Spain,"" and of a Statement by Colonel Callava,"" relative to the arrest and detention of his person, and the forcible seizure, and abduction, under your authority, of certain papers which were in his possession, with a Copy of the answer given to the Letter of M* Salmon""â€”Before an ultimate answer shall be given to the Spanish Minister,â€ upon this complaint, the President has thought it proper to transmit these Documents to you, with the purpose of receiving any remarks, either in relation to the facts alledged, or to the principles asserted in them, which you may think the occasion requires. Appreciating, as the President does, the sense of duty under which you felt yourself compelled to resort to to these measures, and the objects of high impartial justice to which they were in your estimation rendered indispensable; I am directed to invite your attention to the following circumstances represented in these papers. 1. That Colonel Callava, claimed as of right the immunities, with reference to his person, to his dwelling house, and to his papers, which by the customary Laws of nations belong to public Commissioners appointed to negotiate or to execute Treaty stipulations between nation and nation. 2. That you had transacted business with him in the Capacity of a public Commissioner as late as third of August, three weeks after the day on which the surrender had been made of the Territory. 3. That the papers finally seized by your orders, had never been officially demanded, and that he had offered to deliver them or give adequate security that they should be delivered, if they should prove to be of the description of papers stipulated by the Treaty to be left in the Territory. 4. That at the time when he was forcibly brought before you, and required to submit to examination upon interrogatories, neither the questions asked of him, nor his answers were correctly interpretted. It is proper to apprize you that in the opinion of the President, so far as Colonel Callava, could justly claim the Rights of a Commissioner for the surrender of the Territory, he was entitled to all the immunities which might be necessary for the execution of his trust, and which the Laws of Nations recognize as belonging to public Ministersâ€”As authority for this opinion, I refer you to Wattal,â€ Book 4. chap. 6 & S 75â€”and Chap. 9 & S 125 A different sentiment appearing from your Letter of the 26 August to have been entertained by you, it would be satisfactory to learn upon what grounds it had been taken up, or if the privileges incident to this immunity, had in your view ceased, it is desirable to know the considerations upon which you had so deemed of them; the view taken of them in the answer to the note of M"" Salmon, admitting the right only in general terms, and inferring that they had ceased by the act of surrender, and of reasonable time for departure, as well as by the limitation of the time for the surrender stipulated in the Treaty.""

Power of the President to order the discharge of an Officer of U.S. arrested at the Suit of a citizen.â€”Capt: Bell's case. Acting Governor of Florida. SIR, The letter of Abr"" Eustis, from S*Augustine, of date 2 Oct. last,â€ which you have done me the honor to refer to me, statesâ€” â€œCapt. Bell is arrested at the suit of one Fairbanks whom he ordered to be confined in the Fort (for being concerned in negro-stealing) before the civil government was organized and while he was acting as provisional Governor.â€â€”In your endorsement on this letter you inform me that â€œCapt Bell acted under the authority of Gen Jackson, in the place of M"" Worthington until his arrival. It was for an act performed in that trust that he has been arrestedâ€. Your question is whether the President can order his discharge?â€” Had the case occurred in any state or any other territory of the United States, there would be no difficulty in answering the question in the Negative: nothing being clearer as a general position under the Constitution and laws of the U. States, than that the President has no right to interfere in a civil suit between two citizens. The Governors of all the territories and states, are answerable for torts done by them, under color of their office: they may plead, in their defence, that the act was lawfully done under the authority of their office, and if the defence be true in fact, it will avail them before the Court which tries the cause: but it is not in the power of the President to interfere, in any manner, with the progress and termination of the suit. It would be monstrous if it were otherwise in a republican government since under the English monarchy the governor of a distant province, armed both with civil and military power, was held subject to the action of an individual in England, and amerced in very heavy damages for a tresspass and false imprisonment: I allude particularly to the case of Martyn vs. Fabrigas. Cowper's Reports 161. Such is the answer which I should give to the question had the case occurred anywhere else within our limits, than in the Floridas: but as the matter stands the question refers itself to a system of foreign Laws with which I am not acquainted. The Constitution (article 4* Section 3 clause 2) declares that â€œCongress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United Statesâ€.â€”In the exercise of this power Congress at the last session by the act for carrying into execution the treaty between the U. S. and Spain provided â€œthat untill the end of the first session of the next Congress unless provision for the temporary government of said territories (the Floridas) be sooner made by congress, all the military, civil and judicial powers exercised by the officers of the existing government of the same territories shall be vested in such person or persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the President of the U.S. shall direct &"" In pursuance of this act Gen Jackson received a commission which clothed him with all the powers of the Governor and Captain General of Cuba over these provinces; and it was while acting as his substitute that Capt Bell did the act which subjected him to the suit of Fairbanks. If the Governor and Captain General of Cuba was, at the time, of the enactment of this law, was in the exercise of a power which authorized him to discharge an ex Governor of Florida from civil suits; for acts done in his capacity of Governor, Governor Jackson having succeeded to the same power, may discharge, in like manner, the ex governor Capt Bell from the suit of Fairbanks, and if possessing the power he declines exercising it, spontaneously, then, as he is to act under your instructions, you may instruct him to do it. The questionâ€”therefore as to your power, depends on the Constititution and laws of the Spanish Monarchy, with regard to the government of its provinces, with which I am not sufficiently acquainted to answer the question proposed to me. The extent of these powers as they were actually exercised in the Floridas (the criterion assumed by the act of Congress) can be more easily and safely ascertained on the theatre of their exercise, and by those who can have access to the records and archives of the provinces while under the Government of Spain, than by us at this distance and the disadvantages under which we labor. Governor Jackson, or his representative might, if you think proper be instructed to examine both the merits of the particular case of M* Bell and the extent of the power, and to examine it or not as the justice of the case might seem to require or to report to you for your farther consideration. I shall only observe in closing, that even if the power should be found to exist, it is so entirely at war with our political institutions and modes of thinking, that nothing can render its exercise palatable or even endurable, but the averting of some extreme injustice which cannot be otherwise avoided & if M Eustis statement may be relied on such injustice seems to be threatened in the case of Capt Bell.â€ I have the honor to remain, Sir, Very respectfully Your Obed Servt Win WIRT",1821,November,5,1821-11-05,OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE U.

I am not yet aware how far, the consent of the Indians has been obtained relative to this grant, my impression however is that not a single condition named in the grant has been legally complyed with, as far as it respects the consent of the Indiansâ€” I shall be able to assertain fully at the talk appointed to be held at Alachua on the 20"" instant I have said in reply to Arredondos application for permission to survey the track imbraced in the grant alluded to, that I am not authorized to give permission to any person or persons to make a settlement on lands belonging to the Indians, or to survey or attempt to survey or designate any boundaries by marking trees or otherwise within the limits of the Indian country of Florida, which limits or boundaries was settled by the English and Indians at a talk held at Picolata on the 18 Nov 1765 * which also appears to have been admitted and acknowledged by the Spanish authorities at a talk held at Pensacola in May 1784 * and in all treaties and talks since whenever boundaries or lands has been spoken of, without particular instructions from the department of warâ€” If I am incorrect in not allowing surveying parties to traverse the Indian country without the authority of the Gov"" of the United States, it is desirable that I receive more particular instructions on the subject, as soon as practicable, for until I do, not a settler or an attempt at suvey will be permitted by me in the Indian countryâ€” I have not the least doubt but that the Spanish authorities have uniformily admitted the right of the Indians to the country within certain limits expressed in the treaty of 1765 made by the English and Indians renewed again and confirmed by the Spaniards in 1784, altho' the treaties or copies of them are not to be found here; the treaty of 84 was here in 1813, for we find that Don Onis * was at that time furnished with a copy of itâ€”However on examining the Archives taken from the late Spanish officers at this place enough has been found and retained in my opinion to satisfy the Gov"" that the grants made by the late Spanish government here, of lands in the Indian territory without providing for the extinguishing of the Indian tittle, will be null and voidâ€” The grants by the Capt General of Cuba as well as I understand, conditions, that the consent of the Indians must be had in all cases before a suvey can take placeâ€”I have lately discovered a considerable stir among the Spanish inhabitants who hold grants, and who have been forbid going into the Indian country to trade as license can only be granted to an American citizen or those who have taken the oath of allegiance to the United States.

"NA:WD, OIA, SW Lets. Sent, Bk. E *",Correspondence,THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR JACKSON,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,GOVERNOR JACKSON,"GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON Nashville Tenn: SIR, I have received your letters of the 17* & 20* Septâ€™,â€ the first, containing a Copy of an unauthorized talk held with the Indians in Florida by a Mr Dexter and M. Wanton, the latter, a copy of a talk held with them by yourself and a letter written by you to Gen.' McIntosh. The view which you have taken in relation to the Indians generally and particularly of those in Florida, appear very correct. I entirely concur with you that it is perfectly absurd to hold treaties with those within our limits as they neither are or can be independent of our government. This opinion has been frequently communicated to Congress, and although they have not yet adopted it, I still hope they will ultimately. By its adoption, both ours and their interest would be advanced and all of the objections which may be urged against almost every Indian Treaty which has been made be then avoided. As it regards the Indians in Florida, I can entertain no doubt, but that it would be expedient to remove them entirely out of limits of Florida, for the reasons you have assigned, and such also is the opinion of the President; but he is of opinion that it would be improper for that purpose without the sanction of Congress & a special appropriation to resort to force or to incur any considerable expenditure. Should there appear to be any prospect at the next session to effect so desirable an object it will be brought before Congress. If, however, nothing better can be done than to concentrate them in Florida, the part which you propose, appears to me to be the most eligible. I have by the direction of the President appointed Cap"" Bell agent during your absence from Florida and Cap"" Pelham sub agent to fill the vacancy which has been occasioned by the death of M"" Pennieres. I enclose you a copy of my instructions to the former. When I drew them up I had not your last communication, and was not apprized of the extent to which Dexter & Wanton had carried their assumption of power to act with the Indians, having at that time only received some communications from them to Cap"" Bell giving information in relation to the Indians; but even on those, I did not doubt but they were unprincipled individuals, who ought to be removed from the Indian Country. Your letter with its enclosures leaves no doubt as to the correctness of this impression. M. Pennieres had no instructions from this Department to proceed to the Havana to obtain any information connected with the discharge of his duty; and I presume, he had come to that determination under an erroneous view of his general instructions which directed him to report such information as he might obtain on the cessions which had been made by the Indians to the Spanish & English governments. I have directed Cap"" Bell to give Richards the appointment of Interpreter which you recommend and the sum which you have paid to him will be allowed. Since I received your last, M. Brown to whom you refer has called on me; and as I do not doubt from the high manner in which you speak of him that he is well qualified for any place connected with the Indian Department in Florida, I would readily have conferred on him the appointment of Sub Agent if the place had not been previously filled by Cap' Pelham.

"LC: Jackson Papers, Bk. 61: ALS",Correspondence,DAVID SHANNON TO GOVERNOR JACKSON,DAVID SHANNON,GOVERNOR JACKSON,"DEAR GENERAL, Nothing of interest has transpired at this place since the date of my lastâ€â€”We are getting along quite smoothelyâ€” The system of Jurisprudence established by your excellency appears to have an admirable effect. The defaulting debtor is compelled to render to his creditor his dueâ€”the wrongdoer is brought to speedy justice, and the felon and disturber of the peace and good order of the community are adequately punished. Our court is resorted to both by Spaniards and Americans, in which they all appear to have the most implicit confidence. In short, all parties seem willingly to submit to the silent but efficient operation of the law. I can say for myself that since the date of that commission with which your Excellency has been pleased to honor me, no exertions on my part have been wanting to justify that confidence which your Excellency appeared to repose in me, and I have the vanity to believe that those exertions have not been entirely fruitless, and that I have the good fortune to possess the confidence of the citizens generallyâ€”to maintain and support which I have now two motivesâ€”for tho my own pride of character would at all times form a strong inducement to act with propriety, whenever the the reputation of your excellency becomes at all identified with that of mine, I can say that so far as the frailties of human nature will permit, your excellency shall be shielded from censure on my account. I believe however that the only objection ever made to my appointment as presiding justice, was grounded on my want of age; an objection, which I hope I have shown, in the discharge of my judicial functions, is in some measure removed, by my long experience in the forum of Judicial proceedings. We have a complete record of all all our proceedings which we will be able to transfer to any court which may be substituted in our stead under any new organization. The mode of our proceedings are very summaryâ€”one debt of $1200 has been collected under execution in one month from the commencement of suit, and several smaller sums with equal dispatch. Before I conclude there is one subject to which I would beg leave to call the attention of your Excellencyâ€”I mean my compensation as presiding Justice of Escambia county. It is true the ordinance of your Excellency allows me some fees; but these are found to be entirely inadequate to compensate me for the labour and responsibility attending my situation. The duties of my office require almost the whole of my time, and I do not candidly believe I will be able to realize more than $150. or $200. from the fees allowed. If, under these circumstances, your Excellency could do something towards procuring from the government an adequate and liberal compensation it, would be adding to the many obligations under which you have already laid me. I am the more solicitous on this subject as I find it will be impossible, if the Gov't does not make mesome allowance, (altho' my whole time is devoted to the service of the public) for me to pay my expences out of the proceeds of my industry, - which is the only means I have of support. I would also suggest the propriety of making my associates some allowance, who have served the public faithfully, to the exclusion of their private business.â€”Do be so good as to write me en this subjeet, and let me know, your disposition one this subject. Give my compliments to Mrs. Jackson and Miss Haysâ€”I suppose Andrew * has almost forgotten meâ€”I hope, however, he attends to his booksâ€”I see your enemies make some noise in the papers relative to the Callava business; but the great body of the American people cannot but approve of your conduct.â€”Accept, dear sir, my warmest wishes for your health and happiness.

"NA:TD, Lets. to and from Collectors:C",Correspondence,THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS (PENSACOLA) TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS (PENSACOLA),THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY,"HONBÂ° SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY SIR, An impression is generally prevalent here, that a Revenue Cutter will be employed on the part of the Florida Coast comprized within this district, and that the Government will perhaps think proper to make this port, the station for such vessel, and extending her cruizing ground so as to embrace the district of Sâ€™ Augustine, or East Florida, thereby including the Cape of Florida, and that part of the coast which is at present the rendezvous of a number of individuals emphatically called wreckers: there are at present, as I am informed by the Master of an American Wessel lately entered here from that Coast, about forty sail employed in prosecuting that business as a profession, the commanders of which openly own their intention to continue on that ground untill they shall be ordered off by the authorities of the U. S. of which they expressed themselves the belief they should shortly have efficient notice: They will not probably be allowed much longer to continue to find facilities in prosecuting that business within the jurisdiction of the U.S. The property of the vessels in that employ is for the most part said to belong to British merchants. At the request of an individual by the name of David Hall, I enclose to you sundry letters in support of his desire to be appointed to the command of the Revenue Cutter in case it should be deemed expedient to employ a Wessel as such, upon this Coast. Mr Hall I am informed has much experience in the navigation of the Gulph of Mexico, and is well acquainted with the Coast of both the Floridas. Some uneasiness exists here on the part of individuals holding property, merchandise and Slaves, which was in this place at the time of the cession; from the circumstance of the injunction that prevent its removal hence to any other part of the U. States. Mr Lewis informed me before leaving this, that he had represented in his communications to your department, that the actual amount of property commercially considered, remaining here, at that period, was very inconsiderable and hardly of any importance. My own observation, since arriving, fully confirms his remarkâ€”indeed the general impression in the minds of the commercial community in our Eastern Cities, that was so predominant in May and June last, that this place would be overstocked with supplies of every description, has resulted in producing a contrary state, for the consignments here as yet been very limited, and there is nothing like a general assortment of any description of goods in the place, though most probably the present absence of merchandise, will be followed in February or March next, by an excess of abundance, which will doubtless prove injurious to many individuals though eventually of advantage to the place. The Surveyor M' Ch."" Jenkins arrived here on Wednesday the 14. instant, he called on me and in conversation stated he had been induced to visit this place from information he had received, in reply to the enquiry addressed by him to the Secretary of the Territory, whether his presence here was indispensable; being informed that it was, he had with much inconvenience to himself, undertaken the journey. I entered, as minutely as was in my power into a statement of the transactions at this office since the commencement of business, laying before him the Books, and copies of the accounts as transmitted to the Comptroller of the Treasury department to the 30"" of September. M Jenkins expressed himself satisfied that the journey might have been very well deferred till such time as the decision of Congress upon the amount of salary to be allowed the officers of the Customs at this Port had been made known, and that as he could not decide without that information whether he should permanently reside here, it did not appear necessary that he should qualify, by taking the requisite oaths and executing his Bond, he would therefore defer so doing for the present, and should return to his residence in Georgia; he left town on the afternoon of the 16"" of M"" Scotts movement I am altogether unadvised. My belief with regard to the performance of the duties appertaining to the officers of the Customs at this port, is that they can be fully discharged by one person, and that the commerce of the place will not, under its present prospects, for some time to come afford employment for more, and barely a subsistance for one, provided the salary at present allowed is continued. In considering the appropriations of money that Congress have from time to time, made, for the improvement of the Ports and harbours of our Country, a belief naturally arises, that our new acquisition will receive attention on that score, in proportion to the advantages to be obtained in improving the local situations by the expenditure of requisite funds in the attainment of those ends which may at once subserve the public interest and the local prosperity of the place. I venture therefore, Sir, to suggest for consideration the building and erecting a Wharf at this Port; at present there is nothing of the kind, every thing being landed on the open beach: the expense of such a work must be considerable, the distance not being less than 180 or 200 yards; the proper materials are found in abundance within the district though not in the immediate vicinity, as the piles or supporters of the plat form, must be a wood which the worms do not destroy.

I have learned that a decision has been made by the President in relation to the Public buildings at St Augustine, in which, from being similarly situated, the Civil Officers here are also interestedâ€” Gen' Jackson had previously given a similar opinion, & would have taken possession of the Government House here but that he was unwilling to remove his family from the house which they had occupied previously to the surrender of the Provinces. By this decision, while I am administering the Gov' of West Florida, I am entitled to occupy the Government House which was intended for and always has been the residence of the Governors of the Province. But it being at present occupied by Eight Officers to whom it was given up by Gen' Jackson and being in the immediate vicinity of the Block houses where the Troops are quartered, and fronting on the only ground near the City which is suitable for a parade; for these reasons, as well as to save a considerable sum to the Government which would otherwise be expended in procuring Quarters for the Officers, while at the same time they would be dispersed through the Town, I have thought proper not to break thro' the arrangements made by Gen' Jackson on this subject, but to follow the course which he had adopted in this respect and which I hope and believe will be approved by the President; I have therefore rented a house for my family at Fifty dollars per month which (considering the high rents of this City) will not I presume be deemed extravagantâ€”and if any difficulty should arise in the adjustment of the account with the War Department, I presume it may be obviated by the Secretary of the Department in his instructions to the Quarter Master.

They present to this Hon: Court the inconvenience to which this Province is subjected, in the establishment and Continuation of the Spanish laws. When it is taken into Consideration that those laws, are inconsistent with the principles and genius of a republican Government, that they are unknown, having never been officially promulgated or published within this territory And when it is also further thdersteed Considered that the Spanish population within this territory does not exceed the number of two thousand souls (Slaves encluded) and that number daily decreasing by their removal to the Island of Cuba, It must be admitted that every rational hope which may be entertained of the early prosperity of this territory must be founded upon the population wealth and enterprise & industry of the American States: That population then whose earliest impressions and most cherish"" Ideas of Civil liberty & Government have grown and been matured under the influence of American institutions, is the population whose good will is to be conciliated in the formation of any system of laws for the future Government of this Territory under these impressions the Grand Jury beg leave to represent that the adoption of the principles of the common law as they exist in the several states will be more congenial to their feelings and habits and best calculated, to preserve the blessings of liberty to themselves and their decendents. They further represent as a greivance and as a Serious injury to the Commerce of the United States the Situation of the Florida Keys that Harbours Contiguous thereto have become the resort of wreckers and pirates and would respectfully suggest to the General Government the propriety and utility of stationing a naval and military force in that neighbourhood, for the purpose of suppressing those disorders. They also represent the absolute necessity of establishing a light house near the entrance of this port, they are impressed with the belief that it may be the means of saving much property jeopardised for want of such an establishment. They also further represent as a grievance That there are no funds in the province and no means whereby the expences of the territory can be defrayed That as all charges of Government; were paid from the Royal treasury of Spain there existed previous to the Cession no necessity for taxes and Consequently none were laid This grand Jury therefore trusting in the liberality and wisdom of Congress hope that a fund may be placed at the disposal of the proper officers sufficient to defray all the expences of the territory.

And your Petitioners, being unable to discover any difference in the merits of the claims of actual settlers east of Perdido river, and those west thereof which have been respected by Congress from the year 1798 to April 1813, have a right to expect that similar acts of relief will be extended to them in like cases; not only because they have obtained under the Spanish Jurisdiction similar inchoate titles to their places; but because they believe, that Congress will, on account of the thin and sparse population of the Floridas at present find it sound policy to hold out liberal encouragement to actual settlers, to induce them to remain upon the soil they occupy in order to strengthen the physical force of the country. Your Petitioners, having full confidence in the justice of their respective claims, and of the reasonableness of their solicitations most respectfully pray that Congress will make such provisions by a general law, or special acts of relief, as will embrace thier cases, by placing their settlement claims upon the same footing as have been accorded to all actual settlers in similar circumstances in the above named States and Territories; And as in duty bound your Petitioners will ever pray.

The regret which I feel at the heartburning which has arisen between you and the civil authority, does not lessen my approbation of your conduct in securing the troops under you command in cumfortable quarters and in using every means to free them from disease. All the Public buildings of course belong to the U States, and next to the Actg. Governor, who for the time being is entitled to occupy one of them, the officers and Troops should have been quartered in those Public buildingsâ€”After this (if to be spared) a house belonging to the Public should have been appropriated as a Court House.: But the Marshal is neither, nor was he ever more entitled to a Public building than any other individual in the City. The Corporation of the city ought to be indulged in a Public house if to be spared from other public uses. In Pensacola I yielded the Gov' House to the military, and quartered the soldiers in the Block houses. The Judiciary and Corporation rented a house for their Public purposes, and I rented a house for myself. I therefore see nothing in your conduct in this particular nor in any other, which I can condemn, nor do I believe that you can be injured by the persecution against you.

Your friends here are highly pleased that yourself and family have reached the â€œHermitageâ€ in safety and they all feel highly delighted at the handsome and brilliant reception given to you by the Citizens of Nashville and its vicinity. Enclosed I forward to you by this mail, one private letter, and a communication from M Worthington, in all seven pieces. I rejoice that we have the promise of M Worthington that the misunderstanding which has heretofore existed at St Augustine is at an end. Yesterday evening two Indians arrived at this place bringing the enclosed communications"" consisting of three pieces, from Doyle,"" Ne-a-moth-la, and Tus-ta-muck-e, and one from the Mulatto King and two other chiefs. From indisposition I have been unable to attend to this subject to day, but will endeavour to despatch it tomorrow. After having a consultation with Judge Brackenridge, I have resolved to send a Talk * to the Chiefs in reply to their letters. which will be delivered to the runners tomorrow, and a copy transmitted to you by the next mail. The purport of this talk will be, to fix their confidence in what you have told them, and to disregard the mischievous interference of meddling people; and at the same time admonishing them to be careful not to mistake the meaning of your words, which they have in writing. I have considered this hint in some measure necessary, from my suspecting that they are disposed to construe the question put by you as to the place where they would like to be concentrated, as a promise that any place would be given to them they should think proper to choose. I shall inform them that in your absence, the Government of this Province is entrusted to me and that of E. Florida, to M' Worthington, and that we are both instructed to repeat your words to the Red people. I am at a loss to understand the meaning of the proposed Talks of Mr Worthington and do not know the exact authority under which he acts, unless it be by immediate instructions from the President, which could hardly be the case, as such instructions would only come thro, you. For myself I do not believe that I possess any powers similar to those M. Worthington is about to exercise as ex officio Indian Agent. If he act under your instructions, it does not appear to me there is any thing like authority for holding â€œsplendid Indian Talksâ€â€”According to my understanding of your instructions he is merely to make known to the Indians the Talk which you gave to the Chiefs who visited you at this place, leaving it to themselves to assemble in Council, and send to you the result of their deliberations. The Indians appear to be a good deal agitated and embarrassed. I will advise them however to attend only to your orders. It appears that M*Intosh has been stirring up mischief and I fear is the principal cause of the uneasiness that prevails amongst those people. Col. Fenwick informs me that Capt"" Bell is under arrest & will not be tried before the 25"" of this month. 10 Not present. 11 Edmund Doyle, a former employee of the British Indian trading firm of John Forbes and Co. at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River. 12 Filed with this letter. 301867-57â€“21 Capt"" Call left here for New Orleans ten or twelve days since- Enquire, of my good friend Capt"" Easter ""the cause of the Captain's visiting New Orleans.â€ I am dear General, Your most devoted & Grateful friend and Servant- GEO WALTON My respects to the Ladies & Capt Easterâ€”No news of Callavaâ€”or the Spanish officersâ€”I feel satisfied, that Callava will not return to Pensacolaâ€”If however he should return, rest assured, that your instructions will be promptly executedâ€”Fromentin is rarely seen out of his houseâ€”He is a poor miserable creatureâ€”Yrs GW- [Endorsed] From George Walton to General Jackson December 17t 1821",1821,December,17,1821-12-17,PENSACOLA,676,1821.1217

MICHELET Secretario JOSE NORIEGA [Enclosure:DS ""] Memorial to Congress by Spanish Citizens of West Florida [December 29, 1821] To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, the unanimous Memorial of the Ancient Spanish Citizens of West Florida, respectfully represents: That a Petition as your Memorialists are advised, was presented to your Honorable Body at some period of its last session, from certain Persons within the State of Alabama,â€ praying that an Act might pass to annex this Territory of West Florida to that State; a subject the expediency of which is likely to be agitated in your Honorable Body during the present session; and your Memorialists are moreover apprized by an editorial article in one of the public Journals of that State, that a Petition having the same object in view has already gone forth also, from this territory signed by about Two hundred of its inhabitants; a disclosure which has not failed to fill them with surprise, because the publicity which is usual and proper on such occasions was never given to the petition aforesaid; because it has never received the approbation or concurrence of your Memorialists; and because there is even reason to believe that some, and probably not a few, of the Petitioners aforesaid, are not, nor ever were, as they therein profess to be, inhabitants of this Territory. Your memorialists farther represent unto your Honorable Body that notwithstanding the natural and honest partiality which binds a colonial settlement to the Parent State; and the mild and fostering rule which the Mother Country even amid its greatest intestine embarrassments, has ever exercised at least over this province; and the seasonable return of constitutional liberty which had so recently dawned on all the wide-spread dominions of the Spanish Monarchy, re-opening to their view a long futurity of promise; they yet acquiesce with cheerful resignation in the motives of public policy and of State, which sundering forever their ancient connexions, have united their destinies with those of the north American Confederacy; and if they repine not at those events, it is because their confidence is implicit in the liberal, and enlightened, and moderate, and paternal principles of its institutionsâ€” Among these your Memorialists are advised that the right of Petition is distinctly recognised and guaranteed, and they are therefore induced to introduce themselves on this occasion, to the notice of your Honorable Body; that the right of self-government is funda- mentally respected, and they therefore venture to declare themselves to your Honorable Body on the subject of the proposed union with Alabamaâ€” Your Memorialists humbly conceive, that by the annexation of the Floridas to the territory of the Union, and the establishment therein of the constitution and Laws of the United States, the necessities which prompted the acquisition from Spain, through the medium of the treaty, are substantially appeased; that no such necessity can be urged to exist for the proposed subjugation of West Florida to Alabama; that it is a measure essentially deficient, both in its nature and consequences, in an equitable reciprocity of right and interest; and as such wholly unwelcome to your Memorialistsâ€” Your Memoralists humbly represent to your Honorable Body that their country is peculiar in almost every of its features; in its climate, its soil, its population, its resources, and its occupations; that they are deeply convinced of the value and force of that principle or Spirit of Laws, so eloquently inculcated by the distinguished writer on the subject, that all legislative provisions, whether municipal or political must have relation to national circumstances and local peculiarities; that this relation is found in the civil and municipal regulations now existing, and which have so long existed within this territory; and that if any sudden and abrupt revolution in the laws and arrangements of a society whose concerns and institutions are already complicated and extensive, can be productive of other than mischief and disorder, your Memorialists are not satisfied that the requisite remedy and relief is to be found, in the present constitution and code, or is likely to be supplied, by the legislature, of Alabama; in which the voice of your Memorialists must be necessarily too feeble to be heardâ€” Your Memorialists farther represent to your Honorable Body, that the proposed union with Alabama, is a measure of permanent duration; that it is one in which all their future prospects and dearest interests are involved; one for the precipitation of which as they humbly conceive, no good or sufficient reason can be assigned; and that it is therefore one which it is clearly desirable and expedient in the estimation of your memorialists to suspend for farther and more mature deliberation and in order that it may hereafter be accomplished, if it shall prove eventually eligible, upon such terms and in such manner as may best suit the great interests which are involved, and attain the great objects which are proposed. For these among other reasons, your Memorialists humbly pray that an Act to attach the territory of West Florida to the State of Alabama may not be passed by your Honorable Body; but that your Honorable Body will proceed with such dispatch as the exigencies of the subject and of the occasion require, and such as may comport with your wisdom and convenience, to appoint for them a separate government upon the principles heretofore received and pursued by your Honorable Body on similar occasions; allowing them as usual a territorial legislature; and providing for them a Governor of established Justice and moderationâ€”And your Memorialists as in duty bound will ever pray &c.

The acquisition of the Floridas has added to the United States an extent of Sea Coast of near Twelve [MS. torn] within which is embraced one of the finest Harbours [MS. torn] Country; and numerous others of less importance: These [MS. torn] not surrounded in the immediate vicinity with a rich and fertile [MS. torn] connected with the outlets of important Rivers, which water a rich and flourishing Country;â€” Your Memorialists look forward to a period when Pensacola from its natural advantages, will not only be the place of deposit for the wealth of a Country, destined by nature to be tributary thereto; but by the assistance of art, in opening internal communications, may yet be a Store House for the riches of the South and Westâ€” Your Memorialists entertaining these sentiments as to the importance of Pensacola naturally inquire to what Section of Country are their interests nearest allied? Is it to East Florida? or is it to the Country in their rear, to wit, the State of Alabama, to which they must look for support? The Geographical position of West Florida is as inviting, in favor of an annexation to the State of Alabama [MS. torn] repug- nant or forbiding that East and West Florida should be incorporated into the Union as one State. Between the Floridas theire never can be a comm [MS. torn] of interest; nor can these Territories, with convenience, be controuled or managed under one Government. East Florida is as large or larger than either of five States now forming a part of the Union: and will the State of Alabama be too large with West Florida annexed thereto? Your Memorialists unhesitatingly declare that it is their solemn belief, that it is for the Political, Civil and Commercial interest and prosperity of West Florida to be annexed to the State of Alabama; and to make known more fully this sentiment, we have caused these presents to be forwarded to your Honourable body; requesting that Congress will seriously reflect, consult and deliberate and find that it will be in their wisdom to grant to your memorialists their request. But should the unfortunate course be adopted, that of incorporating the Floridas into the Union as one State, it is the devout wish of your memorialists, that untill the time, this may happen, the Floridas may [MS. torn] as two distinct and seperate Territoriesâ€”All which is respectfully submited and for which your Memorialists will ever pray J.

"NA:HF, 17 Cong., 1 sess.:C",Memorial,MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF PENSACOLA,,,"At an adjourned meeting of the City Council of Pensacola on Saturday the 29, day of December 1821, The following memorial was presented to the board, and unanimously adopted, to wit: To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, The memorial of the city council of the city of Pensacola, respectfully representsâ€”That they are encouraged to solicit from the justice and liberality of your Honorable body, the same benefits which have been freely extended under similar circumstances, to cities within the acquired territories of the United States. Few cities possessing the important commercial advantages of Pensacola, and with such prospects of future consequence, are so totally destitute of permanent funds, for the support of their city government, or for the erection of publick edifices of the most necessary kinds. The real property once owned by this city, together with a considerable portion even of the publick square, during the troubles of the Spanish monarchy, were disposed of, and the moneys appropriated to defray the expences of the Spanish Colonial government, leaving the city, without even a market house, prison, hospital, or a single edifice of any kind, or a spot of ground whereon to build, excepting a part of the publick square. That under the Spanish dominion the provincial and city governments were inseparably connected, and the publick buildings and property, served the purposes of boath; but the separation which has taken place has necessarily produced a state of things entirely different: That this property, if sold by the United States, will not produce any great amount; but if granted to the uses of the city, will contribute greatly to its prosperity. Your memorialists further represent, that doubts may exist whither the ground in front of the city, covered by water in ordinary tides, extending from low water mark to the depth of ten feet, although not the subject of grant to any individuals, properly lies within the controul and jurisdiction of the City, or whether the right of property therein belongs to the United States: That it would greatly tend to the health and prosperity of this city, that the ground before described, should be declared exclusively under the controul of the said city, in order that such improvements may be made thereon, as may be required by its commerce, without injury to the health, or occasioning publick invenience, as would be the case, if the water privileges were monopolized by a few individualsâ€” Your memorialists therefore respectfully pray that the publick property within the limits of the city of Pensacola, as is disignated by the ordinance of Gen Jackson, incorporating the same, and a narrow strip of land adjoining thereto, bounded by Col. Kings survey; including the sites of Forts St. Phillips and St. Michaels,â€ well calculated from their high and healthy situation for a college, and not exceeding one hundred acres together with the ground in front of the city, from low water mark to the depth of ten feet, be granted to the city council for the use and benefit of said city of Pensacolaâ€”and your memorialists will ever pray &c Whereupon the following resolution was adopted to wit: Resolved that the foregoing memorial be transmitted without delay to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States of America.

I had also the honor to receive a copy of your communication, dated 2* of November, to the Minister of Spain,â€ 1? Answered post p. 368. 13 Printed also in A. S. P., For.

P., op. cit., pp. 787-788. together with the translations of two letters from said minister, addressed to the Secretary of State, and transmitted to me by direction of the President of the United States."" You inform me, that the definitive answer to these letters will be deferred, until you shall have the opportunity of obtaining my reply, with any remarks I may be disposed to make on the communications of the Minister of Spain. I sincerely regret, that Don Joaquin de Anduaga's letter of the 22"" of November, had not been transmitted at an earlier period, as it will be necessary in my reply, to refer you to the two communications of Cap"" Bell, of the 31* of Julyâ€ and 4"" of August last,â€ and to M* Worthington's letters on the subject of the archives at St Augustine; "" the first of which, are on file in the Executive Office at Pensacola, and the last I had forwarded to you when I was informed by Doct. Bronough, that my resignation was accepted on the first ult; not expecting to have any further use for them. Immediately on the receipt of your letter, however, I wrote M* Worthington, requesting him to forward you certified copies of his communications, as promptly as practicable, and have adopted the same measure in relation to those of Capt. Bell, altho' I had been advised that he had transmitted duplicates to you from St Augustine. To these documents I must refer you, relying upon my answers thereto, and my own recollection for their contents, and accompanying my reply with such vouchers as are within my reach; believing that there will be ample testimony in your possession, to enable you to rebut the slanderous statement, and expose the unblushing falsehoods of this insolent and indecorous Minister of the Spanish Government. Upon the subject of seizing the papers at St Augustine, you observe, that the Spanish Minister dwells with much earnestness on the agreement which had been made between Colo. Butler and the late Governor Coppinger, concerning these papers; and request to be informed, whether this agreement was known to me, at the time the order was issued for demanding and securing them; and if so, to state the particular grounds on which I judged it necessary to resort to compulsory measures for obtaining possession of them. In answer to this enquiry, I have the honor respectfully to state, that Co"" Butler, the commissioner appointed to receive the transfer of East Florida from the Spanish Government, reached me on the 8"" of August last, at Pensacola, and made his report.â€ As soon as it was submitted to my examination, I was entirely satisfied, that neither Coppinger on the one hand, nor Butler on the other, had any authority, either under the treaty or their instructions, to enter into such an agreement relative to the Archives, which were, by a positive stipulation between the two Governments, to have been delivered over with the country, to the constituted authorities of the United States. The Treaty was imperative, and vested the parties with no discretion upon the subject. Believing, however, that the course adopted by Co! Butler, was perhaps, the only one that could have been pursued, without the employment of force, to preserve the documents; and notwithstanding I was perfectly satisfied, that Coppinger had, on his part, violated both the Treaty and the order of the Captain General of Cuba, yet I felt disposed to leave the Archives precisely in the same situation in which Co.' Butler placed them under his agreement with Coppinger. I was induced to take this course from a wish to create no unnecessary difficulties, and from a hope, that the Spanish Officers would comply with their arrangement, and permit the papers to remain unmolested, until the arrival of the President's instructions in regard to their final disposition. From the treachery and duplicity which I had discovered to be practised by the Officers of Spain, I frankly confess, that my hopes on this occasion, were not very strong and flattering. This insolent minister states, that the commissioners, Butler and Coppinger, stipulated, that the Artillery and Archives were to remain, the first in deposit in possession of the Anglo-American commissary, and the last where they were; and without the possibility of their being taken away to the Havanna. He does not say what was their situation; but it will be recollected, that the Alcalde was their keeper. Nor does he tell you, that Don Jose Coppinger, permitted them to be picked and culled, and taken away, in violation of his solemn pledge and agreement, as you will see, by a referrence being had to Capt. Bell's letters to me, of the 31* of July, and 4â€ of August 1821, duplicates of which, I am advised, are in your possession. When I received these letters from Capt. Bell, who exercised provisionally the powers and authorities of Secretary of East Florida, before the arrival of M Worthington, I acknowledge, that my indignation at Spanish treachery and perfidy was very much aroused. I felt that it was my imperative duty to protect the people of Florida in the enjoyment of the rights secured to them expressly, under the Treaty. I was bound to act on the occasion. The agreement respecting the Archives, although void ab initio, for the want of power, had been outrageously violated by Coppinger, or with his connivance, and the evidence of individual rights secured to the citizens, about to be fraudulently conveyed away, after he had pledged himself to Co.' Butler, that they should â€œnot be removed from that place, and should remain precisely as they were.â€ The verbal report of Co"" Butler, as communicated in my letter of the 4â€ of August last,â€ affords us a clue to the motives of Co'Coppinger in attempting to practice this base deception. For the last six months previous to the transfer of the country, it is believed, he had been engaged in issuing surreptitious grants for large quantities of land in East Florida. It became necessary, that they should be taken to the Island of Cuba, for the purpose of consummating the titles. These were no doubt the documents which were picked and culled from the ballance, to be transported to the Havanna; as Coppinger was convinced that the fraud would be inevitably detected, if they should be surrendered to the American Authorities. This explains thereason why and wherefore they were not delivered over to our Commissioner in the first instance, and forms the basis of the confidential communication made to Co"" Butler on the 3Â° of July last advising him that a large portion of those Archives, relating to private property, were packed up for removal to Cuba, and which gave rise to his letter to Co'Coppinger of that date as will appear by the enclosed extract marked E.â€ Speaking of the correspondence between Co."" Butler and Coppinger, Don Joaquin de Anduaga remarks; that â€œBy the before mentioned correspondence it appears, that doubts had arisen whether the Artillery and certain Archives ought, or ought not to be delivered over to the United States.â€ With due deference, I would ask, could any doubts exist as to the Archives under the 2* Article of the Treaty? No. Could any doubts be entertained relative to the Archives embraced in the instructions of his Catholic Majesty, or the instructions given by the Captain General of Cuba, to Don Jose Coppinger,â€ Colonel, and commanding the Spanish forces at St Augustine, and who was charged with the delivery of the country and all documents relating to the property and sovereignty of the country ceded? It is presumed not. In his letter to Co.' Forbes, of the 18"" of May 1821, the Captain General of Cuba says:â€”â€œRespecting East Florida, where there ought to be found all her Archives, Governor Mahy would direct that Governor, as entrusted by him with the important commission, to make a formal delivery to M. Forbes of that province, as well as of the documents belonging to it. A similar dispatch would be addressed to the commandant of West Florida.â€ * Here is a positive declaration, that such instructions were, or should be given to Governor Coppinger, for the delivery of all the Archives included in the stipulations of the Treaty. Contrast this statement of the Captain General of Cuba, with the answer of Governor Coppinger to Co.' Butler's letter to him, dated July 3* 1821.â€ â€œConfining myselfâ€ he says â€œto a compliance with the Treaty, and the orders of my Government, (which he informed Co! Butler verbally, prevented him from delivering the Archives) their literal sense is the only guide to my endeavour in the execution, and when any doubts arise, I consult them with that frankness necessary to ascertain my course, and warrant my responsibility.â€ From this exposition, no one can fail to discover a striking contradiction between the Captain General Mahy and Governor Coppinger; the former assuring Co.' Forbes, that he would direct Governor Coppinger to deliver over the documents to the American authorities, and the latter asserting, â€œthat as an individual, he believed they should be given overâ€ See E E * but that the orders of his Government prevented him from performing that duty. One or the other has stated a positive falsehood; for which, the Spanish Government, it is conceived, should be required to inflict signal punishment on the aggressor, both as a violator of his orders, and of the provisions of the Treaty, solemly entered into and ratified by the two nations. We can find no excuse, either for the Captain General, Governor Coppinger, or Co'Callava, for not complying with the orders of their superiors, and with good faith carrying into effect the 2* Article of the Treaty, by delivering, and being prepared to deliver over all the Archives and documents appertaining to the property and sovereignty of the Floridas. Instead of this; the Captain General does not deliver them at Cuba; Coppinger, contrary to his orders, was preparing to convey them away, in a clandestine manner, in violation of his agreement and solemn pledges, until arrested in his faithless conduct by Co"" Butler; and Callava, whilst professing to surrender all the Archives, &"" was wickedly and treacherously attempting to carry away the testamentary papers of the heirs of Vidal, and other documents, which were the evidences of claims to private property in the country ceded to the United States. The unjustifiable delays and evasions of the Officers of Spain, in witholding the Archives and documents, of which the delivery had been expressly stipulated by Treaty; vouchers indispensable to the United States for the dispensation of private justice, and the establishment of private right, but entirely useless to Spain, could not but impress upon me the belief, that they were intended to subserve the purposes of injustice, fraud and oppression. The attempt to carry away a number of those documents, from St Augustine and Pensacola in a clandestine manner, was considered as a flagrant violation of the Treaty, and I began to entertain the opinion, that a systematic combination had been formed amongst the Officers of Spain to deprive the honest citizens of the country of all the evidences of their right to property, secured to them by the provisions of the cession. Under these impressions, and believing myself vested with legal authority to protect the rights of the citizen, I was urged by the most imperative duty to exercise it in their behalf. Upon the receipt of Capt. Bell's letters, before referred to, advising me that the Archives at St Augustine were picked and culled, to be conveyed away, I forthwith wrote him on the 1* of September, 1821,â€ the letter herewith enclosed, marked C, of which the following is an extract:â€” â€œI have this moment received your several letters of the 31* of July and the 4â€ of August, with their enclosures, and regret that the shortness of time will not permit me to answer in detail. On the subject of the Archives, I will barely draw your attention to the second Article of the Treaty with Spain, according to which, all Archives or documents, directly relating to the property or sovereignty of the country, are to be delivered by her. You will, therefore, forthwith on the receipt of this, if not already in possession of them, take them into your possession, and place them in the hands of the Alcalde for sake keeping; and who ought to be like every other, a sworn officer under the Government, and not a Spanish Officer, owing no allegiance to the United States. All papers and documents in the possession of the Cabildo, and of course in the possession of American and not Spanish functionaries, are to be retained, and none of them permitted to be culled and taken away. â€œI am gratified with the friendly expressions of the Cabildo of St Augustine, but am sorry to find they have so entirely mistaken the sense of the Proclamation. Nothing could be more absurd, than that Spanish Officers as such, should administer the Government. The true meaning is, that whenever the Incumbent will take the oath to support the constitution of the United States and adjure that of Spain, and take the oath of Office, he shall be continued therein; the part of the Proclamation which enjoins fidelity to the Government of the United States, would otherwise be nonsense, and the Governor has at all times the power to remove or dismiss him, and supply his place. But this will not be done, unless it be found that he is incompetent to his trust, or unfaithful; and whenever either is the case, this power for the benefit of the People, ought to be exercised.â€ Having previously addressed Capt. Bell a letter on the 13"" of August 1821,â€ a copy of which is enclosed, marked D, and forwarded it to him by M Bird, Attorney for the United States in East Florida, I was gratified to find from his answer, that before the receipt of either of my communications, himself and M Worthington had taken the steps necessary to preserve the Archives, and extend to the People of East Florida that protection, which was secured and guaranteed to them under the Treaty. This will fully appear by referrence to the communications of M. Worthington, all of which I have heretofore transmitted to you- When it is recollected that the Archives and documents relating to the property and sovereignty of the Floridas were to be transferred with the country, agreeably to the stipulations of the Treaty, and that Governor Coppinger had been ordered to deliver those in East Florida; what indignation must fill every honest and honorable breast, when we learn from the letter of the keeper of these papers at St Augustine, that he claims them as private property, which he had acquired by purchase! From whom could this purchase have been made? From the King? No; because he had stipulated to surrender them with the country to the American authorities. If bought at all, it must have been effected with the Executive Magistrate of the Province. In either event, it must have originated in the grossest corruption, and was rendered null and void by the Treaty between Spain and the United States. Such, however, is the reason assigned, why this subaltern Spanish officer disobeys his King, and his superiors, with an insolent Spanish Minister to justify him in his villany, and at the same time charging your Agent, who has in every particular, executed the Treaty in good faith, with atrocious crimes committed against the honor of his King and nation. Although Don Joaquin de Anduaga has taken occasion to heap upon me the most illiberal and indecorous epithets, he is challenged to substantiate a single instance, in which myself or those acting under me, have not scrupulously executed every Article of the Treaty with Spain. There is no foundation, then, upon which to rest the criminal charges of this rude and insolent Minister, save in his own brain; in the falsehood stated by Co"" Jose Coppinger, in his ridiculous appeal to the American People, and in his Protest, to which, it seems he testified with his oath. It appears, that the Minister of Spain considers his sovereign as having been insulted in the most scandalous manner, in the person of his Commissary, Co'Coppinger. At the time the seizure of the papers was effected, he insists that Co'Coppinger was entitled to all the privileges and immunities of a public Officer of Spain, in consequence of his being recognised as such, in doing and transacting business with Capt Bell. The fact was, that Capt. Bell was not vested with any diplomatic or commissarial powers, and any such recognition on his part, was as ineffectual as it was without authority. This position is so truly ridiculous, as scarcely to deserve a comment: By turning to the act of cession executed by Co' Butler and Jose Coppinger, it will be distinctly seen, that neither of those persons retained any powers as commissioners, after the date of that instrument: If this was the case, it must be equally evident that neither Capt. Bell nor Mr Worthington could have possessed such powers at the period to which the Spanish Minister has alluded. Co' Jose Coppinger being the Commander in chief and Governor ex officio over East Florida, he was charged under the Treaty, with the delivery of the Country, and the withdrawal of the Spanish Troops. The moment these duties were performed, both his and Co' Butler's powers as Commissioners ceased. This event took place on the 10"" of July 1821,â€ when the Spanish Authorities ceased the exercise of their functions, as is demonstrated by the following extract from the act of cession:â€” â€œThere has been verified, at four Oâ€™clock of the evening of this day, the complete and personal delivery of the fortifications, and all else of this aforesaid province, to the Commissioner, Officers and Troops of the United States, and, in consequence thereof, having embarked for the Havanna, the Military and Civil Officers and Spanish Troops in the American transports provided for this purpose; the Spanish Authorities having this moment ceased the exercise of their functions, and those appointed by the American Government having begun theirs,â€ &c. The Surrender of the Provinces had been completed, and the occasion which created Commissioners ceased to exist. The authority and Troops of Spain were withdrawn, and the United States in entire and rightful possession of the country. The six months had also transpired, within which the Treaty provided the transfer of sovereignty should be made, as well as the evacuation of all the Spanish Officers within the Floridas. Co. Coppinger remaining after the occurrence of these events, could no longer be considered as entitled to the privileges and immunities of a public Agent. He could only be viewed as a stranger permitted to reside in the Floridas-, â€œamenable to the common judicial tribunals, but who, conformable to the Spanish laws, existing before the cession of the Province, would have been liable to removal from it, or to imprisonment at the discretion of the Governor, for the mere act of being there.â€ These disclosures, I hope, will exempt me from the criminal charge, which Don Joaquin de Anduaga has preferred against me of having trampled upon the laws of Nations, and the law of every civilized country. If the detection of treachery and prevention of fraud; the security of the rights of the citizen, and a scrupulous adherence to the articles of the Treaty, which both Governments were sacredly bound to fulfil, are to be considered atrocities, I have to observe, that I glory in the charge, and give this further assurance, that is the course which I shall always pursue. I would enquire of this Minister, whether the law of nations protects the agents of Spain in the open violation of the Treaty, the rights of individuals, and the orders of their Government? Does this law sanction the noncompliance with the most solemn engagements, by which the rights of individuals were to be sacrificed, by depriving them of those evidences of property, stipulated to be delivered over with the country ceded? If so, then is every treaty a perfect mockery, and the law of nations becomes the authority for every species of fraud and corruption. Coppinger and Callava might not only have furtively carried away all the Archives of the country, but also the negroes or moveable property, and their agency would have secured them from merited punishment! Doctrines leading to such absurd and dangerous results, deserve the contempt and indignation of every honest and intelligent individual in the country. - To the remark of the Spanish Minister, â€œthat the more my conduct is considered, the more evident it is that by it my sole object has been to insult Spain;â€ I have to observe in reply, that it is as insolent as it is unjust. I again challenge Don Joaquin de Anduaga to establish the fact necessary to authorise such a conclusion. If I know myself, I can declare with the utmost confidence, that I have never entertained any thing like national antipathies, and that my conduct, on no occasion, has ever been influenced by such base and unmanly considerations. All the measures of my administration, whilst Governor of the Floridas, were founded upon the principles of justice; the object of which was to secure to the United States and the people who were citizens of the ceded provinces, those rights which were guaranteed to them under the cession, and which the faithless officers of Spain had wantonly violated in contravention of the Treaty, the positive orders of their superiors, and their own solemn pledges and engagements! Such corrupt agents as these, who wore the insignia of Office, as well as the badge of dignity and honor, excited my disgust and abhorrence; and the Minister of Spain would do well to purge the Officers of his own Government, before he is permitted to allege criminal charges against those of the United States. The virtuous and honorable Spaniard claims the same share of my respect and confidence, as the citizens belonging to any other nation. I rejoice in the regeneration of Old Spain, and in the independence of the American colonies, and hope that both may free themselves from that misrule and oppression with which they have been cursed for centuries past, under former Governments. The indecorous language used throughout the letters of the Minister of Spain, and the foul charges therein contained in relation to myself, cannot but be viewed as the grossest insult to my Government, to the American People, and to the Officer whom he has endeavored to cover with odium and disgrace. It is derogatory to that comity and decorum which should always characterise diplomatic communications, and which are essential to the harmony and friendly intercourse of Nations. In reply, I confidently trust, that the President of the United States will take such a stand, as shall secure the respect, due from foreign Ministers to his exalted station, to the Officers of the Government, and to the nation over which he presides. It is a subject of remark, that I have been the object of Spanish calumny and virulent animadversion ever since the transactions of the Seminole War. This spirit of hostility is to be discovered in the observation of Governor Mahy to Co.' Forbes, in the letter of the latter to the Secretary of State, of the 28th of May 1821;â€ in the protests of Colonels Coppinger and Callava, and has pervaded all the diplomatic communications of Spanish Ministers subsequent to the period to which I have alluded. Although such a course is insulting to myself, to the Executive and to the American People, I have never deemed it of sufficient importance to induce me to complain. Feeling a confidence in having always discharged my duty, whilst in the service of my country, I disregarded the abuse and vituperation of Spanish Agents, from a belief that my Government would vindicate its honor and dignity. This I flatter myself will yet be accomplished in due time. The considerable portion of my life has been devoted to the happiness, honor and glory of my country, and where my conduct has met the approbation of the Government, I have a right to expect that it will resist any attempt to slander my reputation. Notwithstanding I solicit the most free and unrestrained investigation into all the measures of my public life, by those to whom I am responsible, it is conceived, that the same latitude should not be granted to the ministers of foreign powers. Such an interference is rude and indecorous, and should be resented on all proper occasions. This, it is believed, is not due to me alone, but to the President and the Nation.â€ I am Sir, with Sentiments of great respect, y M Obt & Huble Sert.

Altho' the papers have been seized, a sufficient examination has not been had to determine if all are there which were expected to be foundâ€”I frequently heard the persons appointed to examine them say that they did not find in the governors office those papers which are usually kept in his officeâ€”Whether any were removed after the 23â€ June which were embraced in the correspondence, I am not able to say, I have no reason to believe there were, altho' the inhabitants interested were constantly complaining of the situation in which they were left, and were paying great fees to the officer, to obtain evidences of their papers being in the officeâ€”I must further state that the Notary Don Juan de Entralgo had declined to take the oath of allegeaince to our governmentâ€”that Govr Coppinger was respectfully applied to by me to deliver up the papers peaceably, before any resort was had to force, and when the papers were put into the hands of certain persons appointed to examine them with diretions to separate private papers from documents relating to the province Gov' Coppinger was given to understand that he or any agent on his behalf might attend the examinationâ€”As far as the examination has proceeded, many papers have been separated from the public documents, put into boxes, and reported to M' Worthington for the purpose of being returnedâ€”By the citizens having property and residing within the Province, the conduct of the American officers in taking the papers was generally approved of.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, x:LS",Correspondence,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON (WEST FLORIDA) TO ANDREW JACKSON,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON (WEST FLORIDA),ANDREW JACKSON,"MY DEAR GENERAL. I do myself the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12* of December,â€ and I assure you it was not without great mortification I found that from the unaccountable irregularity of the mail, so few of my letters had reached you, for I have not suffered but one mail to pass without writing. Within the last two or three weeks the arrival and departure of the mail has been several times changed at this place, so that there is no calculating with any certainty upon it. Nothing of any consequence has occurred since my last. The enclosed copy of a letter addressed by me to Col: Crowell,â€ will shew that the uneasiness of the Indians still continues. I have not yet heard from Nea-moth-la and the Chiefs to whom I addressed a talk some time ago, and begin to be somewhat apprehensive that an accident may have happened to the runners by whom it was sent. The Spanish Officers * are still in confinement, and I am sorry to say that this circumstance has had a tendency to keep up the disatisfaction of the Spanish inhabitants, when I thought the leniency of the course adopted would have disarmed them, but it does not appear practicable to satisfy them, and I therefore look upon their displeasure with indifference. Fromentin has been veering and turning about, of late, like a weathercock. Instead of going to New Orleans, he had determined to go on to Washington in the Hornet, it is now said that he is going to stay, after having given up his house, and shipped off his furniture to New Orleans.â€ It is said he is about to organize his Court at last, * Enclosed in a letter of Mar. 8, 1822, from Jackson to the Secretary of State. and in imitation of Judge Duval, deliver a charge to a Grand Jury. He is too contemptible to deserve any notice. In my last I informed you that an attempt was made to go into a re-hearing of the case of Innerarity: a â€œBill of Review,â€ as it was called was presented to me, and was received in the manner you will discover from the enclosed copy of my decree.â€ It was to be expected that he would die hard, but die he must, and it only remains for the Sheriff to do his duty, perhaps the task would more properly belong to the hangman. Gen' Gaines arrived here a few days ago, and is about to sail for St Marksâ€”The Officers of the Engineer Corps have not yet left this place. A very splendid entertainment was given by Capt"" Henley on board the Hornet, and the Citizens are about to give him one in return this evening at Austin's.

But they regret that ever since the 10"" of last July when this Province was ceded to the United States * their condition has been from the Treasury (NA, SD, Misc. Lets.).

Very unenviableâ€”They have borne with this State of things because they were confident it would be of a very temporary and short durationâ€” In this remark it is not intended to reflect either on the wisdom of our Government at Washington or on the Officers who have been appointed to this Countryâ€”It is taken for granted that every thing was intended for the best.â€”They only wish to be disenthralled from the anomalous and uncongenial situation, to which they have been consigned. They think they may in a great measure be releived, by Congress advancing them to the second grade of our Territorial Governments in the same manner as such Governments are accustomed to be advanced and organized under the Laws of the United States. They confidently trust that Congress will see the justice and necessity of the Florida's being organized under one Territorial Government with the power of having Executive, Legislative and Judiciary Officers of that Territory. Your memorialists are aware that neither St. Augustine, nor Pensacola are so situated as to afford ease and convenience to the Inhabitants of the Floridas to assemble at, in their Legislative Capacity. But there can be no impropriety in confiding to the Governor or to special Commissioners the power, forthwith, to select some more central point. It is well known if we judge from American Enterprize, it is no objection that there be not at this moment a City built in the heart of the Floridasâ€”When the permanent or temporary Metropolis shall be once designated, then, before thier labor & industry the Desert will blossom as the Rose and the still and houseless plain, as by the Genius of Magic, become the Crowded City of business and Learningâ€” Your Memorialists do most seriously recommend the consolidation of the Two Provinces, as of vital importance not only to themselves but to the Union.â€” Reposing in the Wisdom and Integrity of Congress, they submit this most important Petition to their serious consideration, trusting they will afford not only the relief specifically prayed, but extend them, such further aid and asisstance as in their virtue and foresight they may deem liberal and just.â€” Signedâ€” W.

To be freed from the toil and labour of a Public Office, is what I have long desired, and what indeed, the state of my health and other causes rendered necessary: But as it appears that there is none of my public life but what must be traversed by Congress, and having long since requested M*Adams to lay before you the correspondence with Judge Fromentin, from a wish that it might have been submitted to Congress if thought necessary; I did confidently hope, that before the acceptance of my resignation, this correspondence would have been produced, and that with the investigation of all and every part of my conduct, my enemies might have had no grounds to charge me with resigning through fear of impeachment, as M* Whitman and some other members have illiberally and untruly insinuated on the floor of Congress on the 2"" Inst.,"" when supporting his resolution for a call for those papers: I therefore sincerely regret that those papers were not laid before Congress agreeably to my request, and before the call made by Mr Whitman. The moment I saw the Intelligencer of the 2"" Instant, I wrote you to suspend the acceptance of my resignation,"" until this investigation was completeâ€”Not having at that time any intimation of either its receipt or acceptance, from you or the Secretary of State, and fully believing, that if you found Congress had a wish to investigate my conduct, you would have witheld its acceptance under circumstances which were disagreeable to me, and at least, until there was opportunity of meeting the attempts which are made, to stamp my conduct with unworthiness and dishonor. I addressed a note also to the Speaker of the House of Representatives,â€ stating these facts to him, and requesting him to communicate them to that Body, with assurance on my part, that I was ready and willing to meet and plead generally to any charges that might be brought against me. My wishes and hopes not having been realised, but the acceptance of my resignation having been forwarded by you, seven days after M"" Whitman's resolution calling for the papers had been passed, leaves but one course for me to pursue, and that is, such course as I may deem, justice, to myself, and the American nation, may require under all circumstances. I have to repeat the request made to the Secretary of State, that my accounts be closed by the Department, information given to what time my Postage and Stationary accounts ought to be made up to, and to whom the ballance of the funds in my hands are to be turned over, and what directions hereafter are to be given to the Public letters addressed to me from the Floridas I make you a tender of my thanks, for the very flattering manner of approbation, which you have been pleased to express of all my Public acts, and services; and the friendly expressions of solicitude for my individual health and happiness, I sincerely reciprocate I am, Dr Sir y Mo Obt Servant ANDREW JACKSON JAMES MONROE President of the U Statesâ€” [Endorsed] Janâ€™ 29, 1822 Gen' Jackson to J Monroe complainingâ€” affair with Mr Fromentinâ€”acceptance of resignation &c was unsuccessful in his efforts to get Congress to take up the question of Jackson's conduct in Florida (Annals of Congress, 17 Cong., 1 sess., cols. 534, 558â€“559, 610â€“619, 620, 826â€“828, 1155â€“1164).

PERRY,THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY,"SIR In obedience to your order of the 7"" of Februy,â€ I proceeded to this Island for the purpose of carrying into execution your instructions, and in consequence of boisterous weather on our outward passage by which we lost two of our Spars, I was compell'd to Stop a few Hours at Havanna for the object of replaceing them, this course was however by no means out of our route, and it fortunately afforded me an opportunity of takeing under convoy five American vessels, a list of which is herewith enclosed.â€” In reguard to the Island in question I have the honour to report, that after carefully examining its whole extent, Sounding the Harbour, and otherwise makeing such observations as your instructions directed, I have come to the conclusion that it possesses many advantages, as a Naval Rendezvous, and in consequence, have in the name of the U. States taken formal possession of it, giveing it the name of Thompsons Islandâ€ * and have left Mids"" Joseph Morehead and one man to retain possession until further assistance can be furnished themâ€”at present their situation is tolerably comfortable. In selecting this name, I have not only gratified my own wishes, but have complied with the request of the proprietors of the Soil present on the Occasion of planting the Standardâ€”and whose names are John Warner Esq. U. S. Commercial Agent at Havanna, and Messâ€ Fleming"" & Whitehead * all American Citizens.â€” The western end of the Island is the only part that can be approached by anything larger than a Boat At this extreme the Harbour is formed by a part of Thompsons Island and several mangrove & sand Keys many of which are covered at High waterâ€” The Harbour to which I have given the name of Port Rodgersâ€ "" is capacious and sheltered from the prevailing Northerly and Easterly Winds, it is however open from the South to West which is a matter of but little importance as the winds in this part of the world but Seldom blow from the Southwestern quarter, The Depth of water in the Harbour is from 3 to 5% Fathm"" but Wessels may find Safe anchorage without going into less than 4 fathomsâ€”The Tides are rapid and thier rise and fall about 6 Feet, wood and water is abundant, the latter not of the best quality Fish and Game are to be taken in the greatest profusion, and in the course of a Year or two the Proprietors of the Island, will be able to Supply Ships with Fruit and Vegetables.â€” The watering place is two miles from the anchorage ground, situated on the South Side of the Island, The well about 100 Yards from the Beach, the Landing is at present inconvenient but will become less so, Should the Island be resorted to by our Cruisers, as the Officers will naturally for their own accommodation, add to the facilities of Shipping the Waterâ€” I have already enlarged the Wells, and enclosed one with a Fence, clear'd a large Garden Spot, planted Stakes on a Mud Bank, that partly obstructs the channel into the Harbour and otherwise employed the period of my stay at the Island in makeing such improvements as will benefit those who may hereafter visit the portâ€” It may well be supposed that on a coast so peculiarly dangerous as the Florida Keys. the difficulties of Navigation must be very numerousâ€”requireing on the part of the Navigator the utmost caution to avoid the innumerable Shoals, Rocks, and Sand Banks that surround him in every direction, and altho' these dangers, are laid down with admirable accuracy by the English Surveyors, yet the Tides and currents are so rapid and irregular, that untill proper and 44 John W. C. Fleming, a merchant of Mobile, Ala. Skillful Pilots are establish'd, it would be imprudent for our large Vessels to cross the Reefâ€”In time of War however these very dangers will prove of Service to our Cruisers as a Knowledge of the Navigation will enable them to pass and Re-pass the Reef without danger, and the want of Such Knowledge will prevent the Enemy from reaping the same benefit In regard to the advantages of Thompsons Island, as a place of Trade I feel at a loss in forming an opinion its location is most certainly in its Favour, being Situated about midway between florida, and Cuba, The Southern States and Louisianna which circumstance has induced many to believe that in the course of time, The Island must become a place of considerable commerceâ€”Heretofore the Florida Keys have been the resort of smuglers New providence wreckers, and in fact of a Set of desperadoes who have paid but little regard to either Law or Honesty, the present establishment tho' on a Small Scale will I conjecture, (with the assistance of the Settlers) be enabled to keep these lawless people from this Islandâ€” but I would suggest the necessity of an early augmentationâ€”of forceâ€”if it be only for the purpose of enforceing the Revenue Lawsâ€” A Gun Boat would be a force sufficient to answer all the purposes required.â€” In enumerating the advantages possessed by this Island and its contiguous waters, and in reccommending it as a situation well calculated for a Naval Rendezvous, I have looked to a period when our country shall be engaged in a war with Some great Maritime Stateâ€”and when the undisputed possession of the Florida Keys will be a matter of great importance, as it will insure the undisturbed Navigation of the North West side of the Florida Stream (or Gulf of Florida) to our Merchant Wessels, and will prove a check, on the vast resources of the Island of Cubaâ€”vast indeed, if possessed by the enterpriseing Government of Great Britain.â€” I may be excused in takeing this opportunity of Suggesting through you Sir, to the Hon"" Scy of the Treasury the great want of Light- Houses on the Florida Keysâ€”The happy transfer of so fair a portion of Territory to the U. States has led to the belief that under the enlightened and liberal policy of our Government, the Navigation of the Shores of Florida will be rehÃ© rendered more safe and convenient, Numberless are the Wessels, and lives, that have been lost on this treacherous Coast, so common are Ship wrecks in in this neighbourhood, that many Vessels are employed Solely for the purpose of rescueing property from destruction, of which they receive a very large Share as Salvage""â€” That rapid current denominated the Gulf Stream Sweeps the Florida Reef, with incredible velocity, changing its course at every variation of the wind thereby baffling the Skill of the most experienced Navigator, and as they are deprived of the common Beacons, so necessary in the Navigation of an intricate coast so are they at all times exposed to the most eminint dangerâ€” â€” The great number of vessels that daily pass through the Gulf of Florida, to & from the Ports of New Orleans, Pensacola Mobile, the Ports of Cuba, Jamaica and the Spanish Maine renders the erection of Light Houses, not only as an act of justice on the part of our Government, But humanity and a regard to the Safety of the lives and fortunes of our citizens Seriously demand so desierable a measureâ€” I should feel diffident in thus intruding my opinions upon you Sir were I not fully impress'd with the belief that the Subject requires the prompt and serious consideration of Government.â€” At present Vessels bound into the Gulf of Mexico & Mexican Sea, are compell'd to make the Island of Cuba for the purpose of Shapeing a correct course to clear the dry Tortugasâ€”(The Southern extreme of the Florida Reef) by approaching Cuba they expose themselves to the depredations of the numerous Picaroons, that infest the neighbourhood of that Islandâ€”But if Light Houses were erected on the Florida Keysâ€”Wessels in passing and Re-passing through the Gulf might Keep on Soundings, the whole distance and indeed might find safe Navigation inside the Reef- As to the number and location of the Light Houses I should presume there ought to be four, one on each extreme of the Florida Reef, the other two at intermediate spacesâ€”Say one on Cape Florida, another on Key Largo and the third on Sand Key (if Sufficiently Stable) and the fourth on the South west Tortugasâ€”A Light House is also very much wanted on cape Canaveralâ€” I have the Honour To be Respectfully Yr Oâ€ Ser' M, C, PERRY THE HON"" SMITH THOMPSON Secy of the Navy [Endorsed] U.S. Sch: Shark Port Rodgers Thompsons Island March 26. 1822 Lt: Comdt: M.

It is beleived that the time first fixed was extended by subsequent proclamations. It is also beleived, that many of the British subjects having failed to comply, with the requisitions of the Treaty and proclamations, applied to their government for indemnity, for the loss of their lands & that commissioners were appointed, in consequence of those applications, who awarded to the claimants what was considered a compensation for the lands supposed to be forfeited, for a failure to comply with the terms prescribed, in the proclamations of the King of Spain. Not only a very large portion of American citizens deriving their claims to land from Spain & the U.

"NA:HF, Orig. Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess.:C*",Correspondence,THE PRESIDENT TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,THE PRESIDENT,THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,"To the House of Representatives of the U. States: I communicate herewith to the House, a Report from the Secretary of War"" containing the information requested by their Resolution of the 5th Ulto 10 It may be proper further to add that the Secretaries of both the territories have occasionally required and received the aid of the military force of the U. States stationed within them, respectively, to carry into effect the acts of their authority. ' The government of East and West Florida was, under the Spanish dominion, almost exclusively military, the governors of both were military officers, and united in their own persons the chief authority both civil and military. The principle upon which the act of Congress of the last session providing for the temporary government of the newly ceded provinces, was carred into execution, has been communicated to Congress in my message at the opening of the session."" It was to leave the authorities of the country, as they were found existing at the time of the cession to be exercised until the meeting of Congress, when it was known that the introduction of a system, more congenial to our own institutions, would be one of the earliest and most important subjects of their deliberations. From this, among other obvious considerations, military officers were appointed to take possession of both provinces; But as the military command of General Jackson was to cease on the 1* of June; General Gaines the officer next in command then here who was first designated to take possession of East Florida, received from me a verbal direction to give such effect to any requisition from the Governor for military aid to enforce his authority, as the circumstances might require. It was not forseen that the command in both the provinces would before further legislation by Congress on that subject devolve upon the Secretaries of the territories, but, had it been foreseen, the same direction would have been given as applicable to them. No authority has been given to either of the Secretaries to issue commands to that portion of the Army which is in Florida; and whenever the aid of the military has been required by them it has been by written requisitions to the officers commanding the troops who have yielded compliance thereto, doubtless under the directions received from General Gaines, as understood by him to be authorized. Shortly before the meeting of Congress, a letter was received at the War Department from Colâ€ Brooke, the officer commanding at Pensacola, requesting instructions how far he was to consider these requisitions as authoritative; but the assurance that a new organization of the Government was immediately to be authorized by Congress was a motive for superseding any specific decision upon the inquiry.

On the letter of Mr Worthington Secy of East Florida dated 9* March 1822* & the documents to which they refer, I would respectfully remark, that the license granted to M Levy * to purchase 60 horses & 100 head of cattle will greatly distress those Indians, because if the government concentrate the Florida Indians they must turn their attention to agricultural pursuits, and in that case, horses & cattle are absolutely necessaryâ€”It should be the objects of the Agents of Government in Florida to protect the Indians in the little property they now possess, and I had directed that no sale of negroes, horses or cattle should be made by the Indians to the inhabitants or traders of the country before a treaty should be concluded between them & the United States, when they would be informed of the situation in which they stood with government & what was there true interests. The amount of Anthony Pastor's account against the United States has been settled & paid by me in full for as much as he is entitled to receive; he is not worthy of confidence, his character may be found among the Spanish documents, & transactions which have come to my knowledge, his services as Interpreter should be discontinuedâ€” Richards now holds the appointment of Interpreter for Seminole Indians and is no doubt worthy of the confidence reposed in him. I am of opinion that the Indians East of the Suwana should be required to move to that section of country between the Suwana & Appalachacola rivers & that the Agency be established at Fort Gadsden, S' Marks or within the country assigned to the Indians which I believe would be preferable, and I would respectfully propose, that a government Agent be directed to proceed from S*Augustin through the Indian country to Pensacola with a view to examining into the situation & disposition of the Indians, the most practicable routs for carrying the mails and the most elligible cite for the Agency in Florida. My accounts for disbursements in the Indian department in Florida will be submitted to the Auditor for settlement and if practicable I will be prepared to set out for S."" Augustin on Thursday next, or at furtherest on the thursday following, the delay to that day, Would be to take with me papers & documents from government to its agents or individuals in that Province.

The utility of erecting light houses at all or some of the points designated cannot be doubted. At present the department is not in possession of any other evidence, than what is contained in these papers. An appropriation for two light houses to be erected during the present year, at such points, upon the Florida reef, or upon cape Florida as the President shall designate, will perhaps, be as much as ought to be provided for at the present session. Further information may be obtained, before the next meeting of Congress, which will enable that body to decide whether a greater number ought to be erected. It is impossible to form a correct estimate of the expense of building two light houses at this time. It is probable that the materials will have to be obtained from a distance; and the provisions necessary to subsist the workmen, as well as the workmen themselves, will have to be obtained in the same manner. An appropriation for two light houses ought probably to be not less than twenty thousand dollars. I remain with respect your most obt Serv"" Wm. H CRAWFORD HONBÂ° THO"".

Simonton * [December 7, 1821] Key West is a small Island immediately on the edge of the Florida Stream, situated in Lat. [blank] Seventy five miles north by west from Havanna & about 85 miles from Matanzas, and quite contiguous to the most of the out ports on the north side of Cubaâ€”sayâ€”Bay of Honda, Cabannas, Mariel, St. John de los Remedions, Arraco &c &c which are all places of considerable trade and depend almost entirely upon Havanna for their suppliesâ€”It has an uncommon large and safe harbour, where men of war with any draft of water may enter and lay with safety. It has two never failing Springs of water, one of which is quite convenient to the harbour, and wood in great abundanceâ€” An establishment at this Island would be of great importance to the Government, as well as to the Merchants of the United States. As a harbour and rendezvous for our vessels of war it being one of the most commanding places on the whole coast of Florida. The revenue that would arise from the importations of Sugar, Coffee &c. the productions of the Island of Cuba, as well as from other places in the Bay of Mexico, the distance being so short that an immense deal of property would be sent there as well as Specie in Vessels which seldom go now from the Coast of Cuba and receive in payment there of the productions of the United States, which trade would be of great advantage to the american commerce. It would be an excellent Harbour for our Merchants vessels to touch at bound to and from the Bay of Mexico to the Atlantic States in cases of distress which too frequently happen when they have no other place to touch at except a port in the Iland of Cuba where they are subjected to heavy expensesâ€” It is the only eligible situation for a depot for wrecked property on the whole coast of Florida, it being about midway between the dry Tortugas and Cape Florida. We are at this time wholly dependant on the wreckers of New Providence for the protection of our property in case of Shipwreck, and when that occurs it is carried to New Providence, which affords a living to more than 500 persons, and employs 50 or 60 vessels and produces a large revenue to the Government and a great pecuniary benefit to the merchants of that place, because a salvage is generally allowed of from 50 c 75 pr. Cent. If this place was made a Port of Entry it would in all probability become a place of depot for the productions of other Countries particularly that of Great Britain and France, as it may be termed a key for the whole of the Bay of Mexico and the north side of the Island of Cuba.â€” Arrangements are now making and in the event of this place being made a Port of Entry ware houses will immediately be erected under the directions of merchants regularly established there (signed) J.

[Enclosures:ALS] John Rodman to Acting Governor Worthington ST. AUGUSTINE 20th May 1822 SIR, I have had the honour to receive your letter of the 18th Inst addressed to M* Drysdale and myself. In answer to which, as far as relates to myself, I beg leave to make the following observations: After the delivery of your opinion in the case of McHardy against Saavedra, Judge Law most assuredly did express doubts in regard to the existance of the County Court, and hesitated to grant orders in his character of Judge of that Court. He said that he considered the late act of Congress, providing for the Government of Florida, as virtually abolishing the County Court. Upon observing to him that you had not gone so far in the opinion you had pronounced in the above mentioned cause, he expressed a desire to see that opinion. It was in consequence of this desire that M. Drysdale and myself took the liberty to call on you and request a copy of it. When it was shown to Judge Law, as I am informed by M. Drysdale, he seemed to acquiesce in its correctness, in regard to the County Courts, and the existance of his powers still as a Judgeâ€”in consequence of which he signed a writ of injunction in a cause then just instituted in that Court. The next day, however, he again expressed doubts of his powers as a Judge, and finally declined signing any more orders, or in any other matter acting in that capacity. He therefore returned me a paper containing an order to examine a witness in a cause pending in the County Court, and who was about to leave this place for the Havana, declaring that he did not consider himself authorised to sign the order. It was on this occasion in M* Gibbsâ€™s office that he mentioned his intention of resigning, and said that he should send his resignation to Governor Duval at Pensacola. Upon my suggesting to him the propriety of sending it to you, in order that you might make another appointment in his place, he observed that he viewed the late act of Congress as abrogating your powers, as acting Governor, and that the most proper course would be to send his resignation to Governor Duval. There being then no Judge here to act, and having some cases of an urgent nature, in which orders to hold to bail and to examine witnesses were necessary, I took the liberty to call on you and represent the embarassing situation in which we were placed, and the serious evils which must flow from an opinion in the community that the functions of the Judges had ceased, and that there was neither law nor Justice in the Countryâ€”and could be none until the late Act of Congress should go into operation. You did not hesitate to declare that you considered your powers as acting Governor, under your commissions and the official instructions from the President, through Mâ€ Adams, as still subsisting; and in consequence you appointed D"" Gibson to the office of Judge of the County Court. This gentleman, at first, accepted, but without doing any one Act as a Judge, the next day thought proper to resign. Thus, we are left without any Judge, in this place, to discharge the most important duties connected with the public peace and the administration of Justice. I have now, I believe stated all the facts, within my knowledge, to which you allude in your letter. With regard to the opinion you have expressed respecting your powers, as acting Governor, still subsisting, and that they must necessarily subsist until you receive a supersedeas, or some other official Notice of their termination; and also in relation to the continued existance of the County Court, I have no hesitation in saying that I agree with you. I must confess that we are in an anomalous state of things. The late Act of Congress providing for the government of Florida, though said to be drawn up by men of abilities, is vague and ambiguous on many important points, and woefully deficient in the most essential oneâ€”the Judiciary. But the provision in the last section but one, for the continuance of the existing laws, until altered or annulled by the Legislative Council, I conceive gives complete Sanction to the ordinances of Gov. Jackson, and consequently the Continuance of the County Courtâ€”Justices of the peace, and City Council of St. Augustine, established by those ordinances. I know, indeed, that a contrary opinion is entertained by some respectable persons in this place; but this appears to me necessarily to lead to anarchy and confusion. In that case, we should, until the Legislative Council meet and provide otherwise, be without law either civil or criminal. Crimes of the deepest dye would go unpunished. Every specious of violence and disorder might be committed before our eyes with impunity. Some persons, indeed, are willing to admit that the County Court, Justices of the peace and City Council are still in lawful existance, but that your powers as acting Governor, have ceased, and that should all the Judges and Justices die or resign, their places could not be filled up by you. This reasoning appears to me but little less absurd than the other. Would it not lead to the same dreadful consequences? Suppose all the Justices of the peace in this City, entertaining the scruples which opinions of this nature are calculated to engender, should immediately give up their commissions, what authority would remain, I would ask, to arrest any criminal however heinous the offense charged against him? None indeed, but the Militaryâ€”and I forbear to dwell on the consequences which would result to the Country at large from such a state of things.

John Drysdale to Acting Governor Worthington S*AUGUSTINE 20 May 1822 SIR I have had the honor to receive your Letter of the 18 Ins"", addressed to M Rodman and myself jointly, on the subject of some recent transactions growing out of the present state of the Judiciary in this Territory, and of the exercise of your powers as Governor of it; in which you are pleased to desire that we should say, whither you are correct in the matters of fact contained in it, and what the full and correct state of things on which we have acted, in the transactions referred to, isâ€” As some of the circumstances adverted to in your Letter took place with, and in the presence of, us separately, in the course of our profes- sional avocations; and as the conduct of Gentlemen holding official stations is the subject of our present intercourse; it is deemed proper, both by M Rodman & myself, that we should severally and separately reply to your enquiries- The statement contained in your Letter of what transpired between you M Rodman and myself in the interview we had the honor to have with you at the Government House on the 13 Inst is according to my recollection perfectly correctâ€”That interview was one sought by me and participated in by M Rodman at my request; and my desire of it arose out of a previous refusal by Judge Law to grant on my application an order for Bail. This refusal of the Judge was founded on the impression that the recent act of Congress making provision for the Government of this Territory, in connection with that of the last year making temporary provision for its Government, had wholly superseded the powers of the Judicial officers appointed by Governor Jackson The fact of Judge Laws refusal to act officially and the above cause of it, were in the interview referred to, stated to you by M Rodman & myselfâ€”We farther, in accordance with a desire expressed by Judge Law, requested and obtained from you, in writing, the substance of your opinion, as to the particular point of the present powers of the Judges of the County Courts and the Justices of the peace, delivered by you in your recent decision of the Appellate cause of M*Hardy against Saavedraâ€”This statement was delivered to Judge Law on the following morning; and judging from his conduct, I did suppose, -either, that the opinion which it contained, on the subject of his doubts, had removed them; or that allowing it the weight which the decision of an Appellate Tribunal on a doubtful point is entitled to, he acquiesced in itâ€”The conduct to which I refer and which justified these conclusions wasâ€”the granting a Writ of Injunction applied for by me, and an expression of his willingness to grant the order for Bail previously refusedâ€”In the course of one or two days however Judge Law's mind on the question of his powers again changed, and returned to the opinion that his Judicial authority was at end; and the the Declaration on which the Judge was to have given the order for Bail before referred to was returned to me without itâ€” Although I did not personally recommend D. Gibson to the seat on the Bench recently vacated by Judge Murrays resignation, I approved of it highlyâ€”I had been consulted by M. Rodman previously to his recommendation of that Gentleman to this place, and I concurred with him entirely in opinion that he was the fittest person in this City whose situation would admit of the acceptance of it, to fill this office- Not imagining for a moment that my name could have had any influence on your mind in the appointment of D. Gibson, I yet beg to state that so far as M. Rodman may have used it in his recommendation of that Gentleman, he was fully authorised so to doâ€”The circum- stances of Judge Laws intended resignation, or the manner in which he contemplated making it, have not, I think been at any time adverted to by me to you or by any other person in my presenceâ€” These I think are all the facts within my own immediate knowledge connected with your enquiries; and they form the basis of any agency or concern which I may have had in relation to the subjects of your Letter Aware as I am of the entire inefficacy to any useful purpose of the expression of my approbation or disapprobation of the conduct pursued by you upon the present singularly embarrassed state of the Government of this Territory and of your own situation particularly, I may yet, I would hope, without incurring the imputation of presumption, be permitted to state, that it has met my unqualified approbationâ€”If the administration of justice shall now be denied, and thence in many cases be forever lost,-if crime shall stalk abroad in open day and go unpunished, of the population of this country, of a mixed and unsettled character generally, and partially passing from a state of comparative despotism, shall learn by the absence of all law that its power consists mainly in the habitual reverence which is yielded to it, and hereafter continue its renewed application,-you will be enabled conscientiously to hold yourself clear of these evilsâ€” of the continuing power of the Judicial officers appointed previously to the passage of the late act of Congress, so far as the validity of such appointments depends on the nonexistence of that act, I am firmly, though perhaps erroneously persuadedâ€”of the continuance of your powers as the Gov' of this Territory so far as concerns the appointment of judicial officers, admitting these powers to have been lawfully exercised before the passage of the late act of Congress, I am bound by a regard to candor to say, that I have serious doubts Yet convinced as I am that every exercise of power since your executive authority has been questioned, has been assumed by you for the manifest good of the public, -the error, if in truth any have been committed, is entitled in my opinion not merely to forbearance but to respect and applauseâ€”because committed in such a manner as to violate no rights, and on one of those occassions on which a due sense of public duty demanded the hazard of private responsibilityâ€”I have the honor to be respectfully Sir Your ob"" Serv"" JNO DRYSDALE HIS EXCELLENCY W G D.

There will be within your superintendency one Indian Agent and one sub agent. ColÂ°. Humphreys, late of the Army, has been appointed the Agent & Cap' Pelham, also of the Army, the Sub Agent. ColÂ°. Humphreys will be directed to report himself to you,â€ and you will give him such instructions as you may deem necessary to insure a just and faithfull execution of the several provisions of the enclosed Acts, and of such other duties as must necessarily arise out of his intercourse with the Indians. He will report to you, from time to time, his proceedings, and keep you informed of every thing which may be interesting to be known in relation to the Indians; which you will communicate to this Department as often as you may judge necessary. The sub Agent will be under the control of the Agent, as well as yourself, and will make his reports and communications throâ€™ him, except when that course will be attended with inconvenience or delayâ€”in which case he will communicate directly to you. You will require the Indian Agent to furnish you regularly with quarterly estimates of the expenses of his Agency including the pay of the sub agent, from which you will make out a general estimate of the expenses of the Indian Department within your superintendency, as much in detail as possible, for each quarter; which you will transmit to this Department, one quarter in advance, and upon which funds will be remitted to you from the Treasury. Your draft of the 30th of April, last, in favor of Levi Tyler, for $600, has been presented and paid, and will be considered a part of the sum allotted to your superintendency; but in future no drafts will be made on this Departmentâ€” funds will be remitted to you from the Treasury upon your quarterly estimates only, unless this Department, under particular circumstances should direct otherwise. You will pay the agent his salary and place in his hands quarterly, out of the funds that may be allotted to your Superintendency for presents to Indians and Contingencies, such sums to be applied to those objects, as may appear to you from his estimates and your own observation, to be necessary and required by the public interest. The sub Agent will be paid, throâ€™ the Agent, quarterly, or if more convenient he may be paid by you. The following sums have been allotted, out of the appropriations for this year, for the expenses of the Indian Department within your superintendency, to wit: For pay of Sub Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500 For presents to Indians . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1000 For Contingenciesâ€”to witâ€”pay of 1000 Interpreters, rations to Indians & ' ' ' ' ' ' ' $2,500 In the above allotment of funds nothing is included for the pay of the Indian Agent, as it is uncertain at what time he will be ready to commence his duties: Whenever he reports to you and commences them, you will include in your quarterly estimates the sum that will be necessary to pay his Salary, which is fixed by law at the rate of $1500â€“ per annum. The sums allowed for the pay of a Sub Agent, presents and Contingencies, must, in no event, without the authority of this Department, be exceeded. The Act making it the duty of the Territorial governors to act as Superintendents of Indian affairs affixes no Compensation for duty,â€ it nevertheless has been usual to allow the expense which they may incur in performing their duty, and extra compensation for extra duty, (that is, such as is not attached to them as Superintendents,) where it has been performed. On an Account rendered, your actual expenses resulting from your intercourse with the Indians will be allowed; and should you be called on to perform any duty which does not belong to you as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, on a Certified statement of the facts, suitable Compensation will be made. Mâ€™ Worthington the late Secretary and acting Governor of Florida drew on this Department some time ago for $1000, on account of Indian expenses, and he has been directed to pay over the balance remaining in his hands to Cap"" Pelham, the Sub Agentâ€”If Cap' Pelham has received this balance you will ascertain of him the amount of it, and, if the whole or any part of it has been expended by him, direct him to render you an account thereofâ€”Should any balance remain, he will hold it subject to your orders. The Act passed at the late session of Congress contains several new and important provisions to which your attention is particularly called. You will require the Indian Agent to make to you regular returns of the licenses issued by him in virtue of the authority vested in him by the 1* Section of this act, and you will make out, in the manner and form therein prescribed, an abstract of all licenses issued by the Agent or by yourself, to the 1* September in each year, which you will transmit to this Department annually on that day, or as soon thereafter as practicable, to be laid before Congress. A punctual compliance with the 3""Section, relative to the settlement of Accounts, will be rigidly exacted. The law is imperative and a failure, on the part of those concerned, to comply with its requisitions in this respect, will render it necessary to report them as delinquents, and to withhold from them any further advance of funds, until these accounts shall have been settled. The accounts of the Agent should be rendered to you quarterly, to be transmitted to this Department with your own for the same period, as soon after the close of each quarter as practicableâ€”At all events, the agents accounts as well as your own, for the whole year, must be transmitted within one month after the 1st of September in each year, so as to be settled to that period, annually, as required by the Act. The accounts of the Agent as well as your own must be accompanied by a general abstract of all disbursements, within each quarterâ€”for the present year to the 1st September next, and regularly thereafter for every year ending on that dayâ€”detailing under distinct heads the various objects of disbursement, to wit: pay of Agent, sub Agent, & Interpreters, presents, rations &c. &c. so as to leave as few as possible to be embraced under the general head of â€œContingenciesâ€. To this abstract a statement must be annexed, shewing the names of all persons who have been employed, in the Indian Department, by the Agent or yourself, within each quarter, as Interpreters or any other capacity whatever, with the amount of wages paid them respectively. These abstracts and statements are indispensibly necessary, to enable the Department to lay before Congress the annual statement required by the 3* Section of the Act, and should be carefully prepared and punctually rendered. The accounts with the abstracts and statements will be examined by you and transmitted to this Department, with such explanations and remarks thereon as you may think proper to make, for revision, previous to their being passed to the 2nd Auditor for settlement. It is deemed unnecessary to enlarge upon all the points to which your attention will be directed by the Act of 1802 and the amendatory acts herewith, not doubting but your judgment will suggest to you every thing which may be necessary to a due execution of all of their provisions Orders have been given, throâ€™ the proper Officer, to Officers commanding military posts in relation to the execution of the duty required of them by the 2nd Section of the act passed at the late Session of Congress.""

"NA:SD, Misc.

He feels a deep interest in the welfare and prosperity of this Territory. He is persuaded that several highly improper appointments have been made to the civil offices in this Country;-and he feels it now his duty to warn the government against an appointment, reported to be about to be made of very considerable importance. It is that of a Collector of the Customs at Key West. - It is understood here that George Murray Esqr., commonly called Major Murray, and sometimes Judge Murray, from his having, for a short time been one of the Judges of the County Court in this Territory, appointed by Mr Worthington, while acting as Governor here. Major Murray left this place about three weeks ago for Washingtonâ€”nobody, but his confidential friends, could divine his object, after the adjournment of congressâ€”but it has since leaked out, indeed, avowed by one of his friends, that he went for the purpose of getting the office of Collector at Key-Westâ€”and that he meant to avail himself of a Strong recommendation in his favour for a very different office, which had imprudently been signed by many respectable inhabitants in this place, who at the time were very far from imagining the use to which that recommendation either was originally intended to be put, or might be turned. He was recommended to fill the place of M* Segui a Spanish gentleman here, who had been appointed by the President, one of the Legislative Council to meet at Pensacola the 10"" of this month. M. Segui, at first agreed to go, but Mr Hernandez having declined going,-M* Segui also declinedâ€”and as the inhabitants of this place were extremely desirous that East Florida, should have its full proportion of representatives in the Council, they immediately, on M* Segui's declining looked about for a person to fill his place, who would go to Pensacola with the other Counsellers, who were then about to sail from this place, and there wait for his Commission from Washington; presuming that the President would, in order to fill up the vacancyâ€” appoint any person who should be well recommended by the inhabitants here. Major Murray then offered himselfâ€”said that he was going to Pensacola, at all events, and was very desirous of being appointed a Counsellor-There was no other person could be found willing to go at the hazard of being appointedâ€”and although many objections were mentioned to Major M.â€”as it was an office of no pecuniary responsibility, and nothing required of him but merely to give his vote for the removal of the Seat of Government to this place, which he solemnly pledged his honour to do. A Memorial was drawn up with a pretty strong recommendation, to which a number of names were obtained, every body being anxious that we should have a full representation in the Councilâ€”This memorial was sent on to the President-But, behold, the next day when the vessel was under way for Pensacola, Major Murray instead of going on board of her went on board a vessel for Baltimore, and his friends said he was gone to Washington. The people here, as may naturally be supposed were highly displeased with this conduct. There was, however, no remedyâ€”it was too late to apply for a commission for another personâ€”and thus, by the appointment of M. Gibson who is somewhere in Georgia or S"" Carolina, and who will not go to Pensacola and the appointment of two Spanish gentlemen here who have both declined. East Florida will not have its just number of Counsellorsâ€” and Pensacola will preponderate and give us the law, and keep the Seat of government there. From the conduct of Major Murray some idea may be formed of his sense of propriety in public affairs. Every body was astonished when Gov"" Worthington appointed him a Judgeâ€”he had never distinguished himself in any manner at the bar, nay, it was well known that he was very little accustomed to the practice of the law he had been in the Navy and in the Army *â€”There being, however, no other lawyer on the Bench he became Chief Justiceâ€”but never charged either the grand or petty Juryâ€”and on All occasions showed the most profound ignorance of the business of the Court. In fact he was absolutely incompetent for the discharge of the duties of the office. He resigned a short time before he projected the Jouney to Pensacola. While on the Bench, there were Several suits pending against one John B Strongâ€”a man here of notorious bad characterâ€”Strong fearing that Judgments would be rendered ag"" him, in order to cover his property from execution, made a Conveyance to Major Murray of the Island of Key West which he pretended then to own, and also of a very large tract of land at Cape Florida, and took Major Murray's note for what he pretended was the consideration moneyâ€”Murray at this time knew of the suits pending against Strong, as they were before his eyes every day in the Calendar of the Courtâ€”and Strong told him the reason he wished to make the conveyance to himâ€” namely, to defeat the just claims of his Auditorsâ€”Murray while chief Judge of the Court became a party to this fraudulent transaction, so far as to become the nominal purchaser of these tracts of lands for Strong has told several persons since his reasons for making the sale to Murray. The causes, however, ag"" Strong were dismissed from the docket, on the ground that under Gen' Jackson's ordinances, the cause of action originating out of the County, the Court had no Jurisdiction of the matter.â€”Strong then went to Charleston and sold the island of Key West to Gen' Geddes and the other tract of land to a M. Delespine, without mentioning to them, at the time, a word of the conveys to Major Murrayâ€”they however, afterwards found it out, and demanded an explanationâ€”he then confessed to them the circumstance of the transaction and admitted that the conveyance to Murray was only a cover to prevent his Creditors from seizing the land, and promised to obtain a re-conveyance from Murray. This, however, has not yet been doneâ€”and it is understood that Murray means to insist on his title to Key West, if not to the other tract conveyed to him by Strongâ€”and it is now reported that he is actually applying to be made Collector of that port of Entry and has great expectations of obtaining the office. Of this gentleman's private character, the writer of this letter knows very little; except what these transactions indicateâ€”That he is utterly incompetent to fill such an office as that of Collector, must be allowed by all who know him. He is a man of very idle habits, knows nothing of businessâ€” and has no inclination for itâ€”With regard to Key West it may be well to mention that there is another claimant, whose title appears to stand upon much better ground than either Strong'sâ€”Murray's, or Genl Geddesâ€”this is a M. Simonton now at the Havanaâ€”he purchased the island from Salas the grantee under the Spanish governmentâ€”took possession of it and made improvements thereon, long before the Sale either to Murray or Geddesâ€”and he has now actually many people working on the islandâ€“Genl Geddes has also some people there, and is going there himselfâ€”There is now a suit pending between Geddes & Simonton respecting the title to the islandâ€”but it is said that Major Murray intends to put in his claim to itâ€” The writer of this letter has no sort of ill will or animosity towards Major Murrayâ€”but he thinks it a duty he owes to his Country to state the facts mentioned herein, that the President may be on his gaurd against the imposing recommendation already sent in favour of that Gentleman for a very different situation from that which it is understood he now solicitsâ€”All the facts in relation to these fraudulent conveyances of Strong, have transpired Since the recommendation was signed here.

Your memorialists further represent, that all the judicial power of the Province, excepting in small cases before justices of the Peace, and in cases of appeal to the Governor, centered in the County Court;â€”that this Court, which sat monthly, was generally engaged from one to two weeks in hearing civil and criminal causes which arose in the County, and in superintending all matters of police out of the city; that the Presiding Justice was daily called upon to make orders according to the Spanish practice in the commencement and the progress of suits;â€”that there being no power in the Province to levy a tax to support the necessary expences of the local government, Your memorialists were allowed certain fees to be taxed in the causes brought before them, but which have been found very inadequate to compensate them for their services: the whole amount received by the Presiding Judge being little more than one hundred Dollars, and by each of the other memorialists not more than half that sum:â€” that the discharge of these duties of primary importance in the Province by the Memorialists has greatly interfered with their private concerns, and caused them much personal inconvenience and loss of time.

When it is considered that my situation of Acting Governor was materially different from that of Secretary, I flatter myself that my claim will not be considered as unreasonable. As Acting Governor I was unavoidably compelled to see many strangers, and it was but decent, and proper, that some civilities should be shewn them. My actual expenses were at least treble what they would have been, had I continued to exercise only the Office of Secretary. The expense of living is even greater here than at New Orleans; and besides, the example of General Jackson, who was remarkable for hospitality, rendered it almost impossible for me to pursue a course entirely different, without giving offence, and even without lessening the respect for the Station, at a period when many circumstances combined to render it necessary that it should be maintained. I have observed the strictest economy in every thing which might become a charge on the Government; instead of renting an Office distinct from the House in which I live, I have made one of the rooms in it serve the purpose, not a little to the inconvenience of my family.â€ In addition to what I have just mentioned, I trust the President will take into consideration the various and troublesome duties which were devolved upon me, (according to the existing Spanish Laws and usages) while in the exercise of the Governmentâ€”Upon the whole I feel confident the President will be of opinion that an allowance for extra services, while exercising the Government, is but reasonable.â€ I have the honor to be Very Respectfully, Sir Your most Obdt Serv't GEO.

For many documents which would have shed, it is presumed, much light upon the claims submitted for adjudication, we feel ourselves greatly at a loss. It is doubtful whether we shall be enabled to procure an authentic copy of the treaty between Spain and Great Britain in '83, unless it should be exhibited by the claimants themselves. There are no other means within our reach of obtaining the English statutes making compensation to her citizens for lands, upon their removal from this country, in consequence of a change of government. Even a copy of the land laws, published by the authority of Congress, have not yet been transmitted to us, nor have we received any assurances that such will be the fact. In a territory so remote, and where libraries are very limitted, we shall be necessarily subjected to great difficulty in procuring those means of information, and in some cases, it is to be feared, we shall not succeed at all. Under such circumstances, we respectfully suggest to you the propriety of having forwarded to the Commissioners all documents filed in the different departments, touching the adjudication of land claims in this territory, and which would afford any facilities in enabling us to distinguish private property from that which rightfully belongs to the United States.

I had the honor of receiving by the last mail your letter of instructions on Indian Affairs, dated the 11* day of June last,â€ together with the several Acts of Congress for the regulation of trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes. I shall be careful in not exceeding in manner the expenses set apart by you for the Florida Indians, and in all cases, shall submit to your directions, without pretending to judge of the effects they may produce. The Indian Agent has not yet reported himself. It is desirable he should be among the Indians with as little delay as possibleâ€”The Indians in Florida are in a wretched state, not Knowing what part of the Country will be claimed by the United States, or what section they will ultimately be allowed to occupy. The Indians raised little er Hething during the last year and I fear they will raise for their subsistence still less the present Season. Such is their distress that they have dug up miles of the Country in order to procure the brier root to subsist on. If the Government intend to give them any support in their present distressed situation, the amount allowed to be distributed in rations, will amount to very little. It is important to locate the Indians speedily, whether we regard their comfort and happinessâ€”or the interests of the United Statesâ€” The various claims of individuals to grants of Land in almost every part of Florida, Keeps the Indians in continual alarmâ€”The settlers are crowding in their claims to the lands promiscuously, and fixing their habitations where they choose; I Know the people may be removed by Military force but until some tract of Country is allotted to the Indians, to remove them they must be driven out of the Territory.

My answer to your communication of the 3"" "" has been delayed by absence from the city, to which I have just returned. Doctor England states the law correctly. There can be no doubt of the power of the King of Spain to grant lands in Florida while the Province was his; nor of the capacity of the Roman Catholic Church to take by grant. Our treaty with Spain recognizes and ratifies all such grants made prior to a certain day. The only question in this case is a question of fact. Did the King of Spain grant these lands to the Roman Catholic Church prior to the time stipulated? on this, which is the only question in the case, there is no evidence before me. If it is intended that I am to take Doctor England's statement of facts as correct, I am of the opinion that he is right in his conclusions of law: if otherwise, it will be necessary that I shall be furnished with a report of the facts, which, I presume, the attorney for the U. S. for the territory of Florida can readily furnish; or the whole subject can be remitted to that officer"" for his opinion, which, I would respectfully submit, is the better course, because the evidence is more easily accessible to him, and because the archives of that province will give him a better understanding of the characters of spanish grants and the laws by which they were regulated than we can possess here.

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Secretary of Stateâ€” SIR, Some time since a memorial was forwarded to the President by myself as Presiding Justice of Escambia County, and John Garnier and E. B. Foster associate Justices, praying for some compensation for our Judicial labours""â€”Since which time I have understood from Mr. Murry,"" who has just arrived here from Washington, that five dollars per day have been allowed him as Presiding Justice of St. John's county. For the purpose of enabling the President to fix my compensation, I take the liberty of stating that I received my commission from Governor Jackson on the 24th day of July 1821, and have Continued in the exercise of the duties of my office ever since.â€ TNA (WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 4), instructing that rent should not exceed $12 per month per room, and that it would be proper to take a whole building in which quarters could be allotted to officers according to rank and allowances. On the arrival of Governor Duval I waited upon him and tendered my resignation, but at his earnest solicitation, and to prevent the confusion which might have been produced by the want of a judicial tribunal in the country, I agreed to continue until the legislature should act upon the subject, or until the arrival of the United States Judge. The legislature have not yet met, but will do so in a few days when a reorganization of the County Court will take place. The duties enjoined by the ordinance of Governor Jackson * have required my constant and undivided attention. The mode of proceeding by concilliation which took place before me as presiding justice out of court was preserved.â€ It was also my duty at all times, to make all orders which might be required at the commencement and in the progress of any suit. Hence I was always liable, and was almost daily called on, to hear parties and make such orders as might be required in the progress of causes. The duies of the associate Justices were confined to the time when the Court was actually in session, which upon reference to the record I find to be fifty seven days. When the President takes into consideration the critical period at which I entered upon the duties of my office, and the great labour and responsibility attending the discharge of those duties, the sacrifices which I have made and the privations which I have endured, in indeavouring to sustain the character of the Judiciary, I feel the utmost confidence that in fixing my compensation, he will do me ample justice. I have the vanity to believe that my exertions to maintain the character of the Court, and to preserve good order in the Province, have not been altogether fruitless, and that the part which I have acted has not been less useful to the Territory, or creditable to myself, than that pursued by Judge Fromentin; and yet he has been in the receipt of a respectable salary, while I have received little or nothing. The President need not be alarmed at my claim, as I know of none other in this Territory which can come against the government, excepting a small one of the county attorney. Our county expenses have been small, and defrayed by fines and forfeituresâ€”a tax on original process, and on licenses to retail spiritous liquors, which was usual under the Spanish Government.

Pelham. Sub-agent of Indian affairs, & of my reply to it.â€”In consenting to charge myself with the temporary direction of the affairs of the Indians in this neighbourhood, I have been influenced solely by a desire to relieve Capt. Pelham from the anxiety of a vexatious business, to which his infirm health is wholly incompetent. He informs me that he has never received one line of instructions for his guidance either from your Department, or from Mâ€™ Worthington the late acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs.â€” Capt. Bell, whom I have consulted, & who not long since was charged with the direction of the Florida-Indians, is also unable to give me any positive information of the views & wishes of the government respecting these concerns. At present considerable anxiety exists among the white people, who are desirous either to trade with the Indians, or to establish plantations on the Spanish Grants in the interior part of the Country. Some little fermentation has also been excited among the Indians. Several white persons have already applied to me to grant them passports to proceed to the Indian settlements on different pretexts. I have however declined any interference on these points, until I receive instructions on the subjectâ€”From the best information I can obtain there is not at this time a single licensed trader in East Florida, & in consequence, many of the Indians are compelled to bring their skins, & other articles of trade to this place; & here they are abundantly supplied with spirituous liquor. For there is no municipal regulation to prohibit it, &, even if there were, the civil authorities of this City lack the power to enforce it. The magistrates have already twice, within few weeks, required the aid of the military force to enable their Constables to arrest single individuals. I have been informed that an unlicensed trader, by the name of Craig, has established himself on M""Hardy's ""... plantation at Tomoca,"" (Where he has collected a considerable number of Indians) & that his whole stock in trade consists of Tobacco & Rum. Under these circumstances I have considered it my duty to solicit of you, as early as possible, definite answers to the subjoined queries. Perhaps I ought rather to have submitted these questions to Governor DuVal, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, But we have not been informed of his arrival at Pensacola, & the circuitous route of the mail would prevent a reply being received from him, even if he be there, in less than two months. In order therefore to relieve the extreme impatience of those, who are interested in the decision on these questions, I seek their solution at the source of information. 1* Qu. Do the laws of the U. S. regulating trade & intercourse with the Indians apply with full force to the territory of Florida? If yea, what portion of the territory is to be considered â€œIndian Countryâ€ within the purview of the laws? 2* Is any person, save the Superintendent, & the Agent of Indian affairs, duly appointed, authorized to grant licences to trade, or passports to go to the Indian settlements? 3"" Are the Spanish & other foreign inhabitants of this territory to be considered, as â€œcitizens of the U.S.â€ de facto by merely taking the oath of allegiance; or must they undergo the probation prescribed by the naturalization law? 4* Are settlers to be permitted to establish themselves under colour of Spanish Grants, within the Indian Boundary, as said to have been recognized by the British & Spanish Authorities in Florida? If so, how far may they be permitted to buy & sell with the Indians without license? The settlements at Alachua,â€ Volusia,â€ Hope-Hillâ€ &c &c are within this boundary. 5* In the event of white people committing offences, or becoming mischievous & troublesome in the Indian-country, can they be removed, & by what process? 6* Can the Florida Indians be permitted to sell their Horses Cattle & Negroes? If yea, under what restrictions?â€” 7* Contracts are said to have been made with the Indians, before the cession of the territory, for the purchase of negroes, which have not yet been paid for, or deliveredâ€”Can these alledged contracts now be completed? 8* If an Indian Boundary be recognized in Florida, may the Indians be restrained from passing it, & in case of violation by an Indian, how is he to be punished? 77 East of St. Johns River, in Volusia County. 9* In case it should be necessary to hold intercourse with the Indians or to send a messenger to their habitations, how is the expense of the interpreter, or messenger to be defrayed? 10* Under what circumstances, & to what amount are rations to be issued to the Indians?

"NA:WD, Sec. War Lets. Recd., D 29:LS",Correspondence,GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,GOVERNOR DUVAL,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,"SIR. I have the honor to transmit to you, a talk which I lately held with two Chiefs of Florida, Blunt"" and Tus-Ki-har-gi. You will see from the enclosed that the Indians are becoming restless, and they complain that General Jackson's promises to them have not been executed. The death of the two men who have been murdered by the Indians, will (among the remote settlers,) occasion some apprehensionâ€”I therefore demanded their surrender; which the two Chiefs promised speedily to attend to, and effect. Stephen Richards the interpreter is a man of good character and well qualified for his situation, he was employed by General Jackson during the time he held the government here, and visited Pensacola several times with the Chiefs who came to see and talk with the general. he states that no compensation was ever made to him for his services, although he was assured by General Jackson that he should be paid.â€”M Richards has presented his account, which is enclosed to youâ€”I have on full consideration appointed a meeting with the Indians at the Post of St Marks on the 20th day of next November; this I was convinced was necessary in order to Keep them quiet until you should have time to direct such measures as you may deem proper, and to prepare for the meeting. I cannot too strongly press on you the importance of speedily acting definitively with the Indians. They are represented to me as being in a famishing condition, scattered over Florida, unwilling to make any improvements least they should be compelled to surrender them. I cannot avoid, consistent with my duty, urging that a more liberal allowance for rations and presents ought to be made than that specified in your instructions to me on this subject. If the Chiefs and their warriors should assemble in November at St Marks, the amount allowed for rations, in this Southern Country where every article sells at a double price, would not feed them three days. The Indian Chief Blunt, with whose character you are no doubt acquainted, acted as a guide to Gen' Jackson during the Seminole War, and states that the General promised he should have a pension for his services. I have spoken with Capt"" Call, one of the General's aids, on this subject, and he confirms Blunt's statement. This Chief has requested me to write to you on this subject and learn whether General Jackson ever urged his claim on the Government, and if so whether any compensation or pension will be granted to him for his servicesâ€”Blunt is a candid, and honest man. The funds intended for the Indians in Florida should be forwarded as early as convenient, as the articles intended as presents will have to be purchased in New Orleansâ€”they cannot be procured here. Blunt has made a proposalâ€”which he requested I would communicate to the Presidentâ€”it is to mark out a road from Pensacola to St Augustine. the nearest and best route, and he is of opinion that a good road may be made between the two Cities not exceeding 400 milesâ€” I have understood from the members of the Council from East Florida that Col: Eustis is willing to be ordered to open a road, and Col: Clinch who commands at this Post is equally anxious to assist in the undertaking. A Military road connecting the two extremes of Florida would be highly important in any future war, and would greatly add to the value of the public lands through which it must pass.â€ I have the honor to be Yr Obdt Servt.

I know the talk which Gen' Jackson delivered to you last September, that was a plain & Strait talk, and I hope your Great Father the President; has harkened to Gen' Jackson's words and will soon send me his orders what to do for you.

A copy of the order is enclosed."" The Department has never had but one view in relation to the Indians of Florida, that is, that they should join the Creek Indians in Georgia, which will appear by the papers enclosed to you with my letter of the 23"" Ultimo,â€ but it was found that the people of Georgia had insuperable objections to this arrangement, and in consequence of which it was not deemed desirable to take any Steps for effecting it, without an express act of Congress authorising the measure. The next view was to concentrate them in Florida, and measures were accordingly taken last fall by Captain Bell who then acted as temporary agent for Indian Affairs to concentrate them at the point designated by Genl Jackson, in his letter of the 20"" September 1821 * (of which an extract is enclosed) but these measures were defeated by the refusal of the Indians to meet Capt"" Bell at the time appointed. The Subject would have been resumed this Spring, but the appropria- tion was not made until too late in the Season to hold a treaty in a climate so warm and sickly and where too the Indians were supposed to be engaged in making their crops. The season of the year now approaches when these objections will not exist, and as soon as the Indian Agent arrives, you will cause the Indians to be assembled without delay, and final arrangements made with them for their concentration at the point proposed. The means for conciliating the Indians and facilitating the accomplishment of the object of the meeting are already in the Indian Country (as you will observe by the enclosed extract of a letter from Capt Bell) and orders have been given to Capt"" Bell to place these means at your disposal, and also to deliver over to your order the sum of $298,34/100 which remains in his hands, to be applied to the same object, if it should be necessary. Any further funds that may be necessary to meet the expenses of your superintendency, will be remitted to you from the Treasury, as you have heretofore been apprized, upon your quarterly estimates, as soon as they are received at this Department. It is not in my power to transmit to you, agreeably to your request, the documents laid before Congress containing the accounts of the several superintendents and agents of Indian Affairs, as there is no spare copy in the Department, and they are too voluminous to be transcribed entire. If you will point out any particular part of them which you want, it shall be extracted and transmitted to you. I have no doubt of the important advantages of a road from Pensacola to S*Augustine, and that the military force in Florida might be usefully employed on such a work, but as it would be attended with a considerable expense, it cannot be done without the authority of Congress.""

The law regulating trade and intercourse is considered to apply with full force to the territory of Florida; and the boundaries established between the Indians and English and Spaniards, or which existed at the time the Floridas passed into the possession of the United States, must be taken as designating the portion of the Territory to be considered â€œIndian Countryâ€â€”until some definitive arrangement on the subject is made. 2. The Superintendents and Agents of Indian Affairs only are authorised to issue licenses to trade with the Indians. Passports to go into the Indian Country may in certain cases, be granted by military Officers (see 3"" sec: law of intercourse).â€ 3. The Spanish or other foreign inhabitants of the Territory of Florida, are to be considered de facto, citizens of the United States, after they have taken the oath of Allegiance, without passing thro' the formalities of the naturalization law. 4. Persons claiming title to lands, under Spanish grants, which are situated within the existing Indian boundary, will not be allowed to occupy the lands, without special permission from the government. 5. White people committing offences, or becoming mischievous or troublesome, in the Indian Country, may be removed and punished (See 4.5.6 & 16 Sections law of intercourse.)â€ 6"" In relation to the sale of horses, cattle, and negroes by the Indians see 10th section of the law of intercourse.â€ 7. As it is probable that impositions and oppressions may be attempted to be practised on the Indians under color of contracts made with them, before the session of the Territory, the persons pretending to hold such contracts will not be permitted to go into the Indian Country for the purpose of obtaining their fulfillment, except under the authority of a license from the Superintendent or Agent of Indian Affairs, to whom application must be made for that purpose. FL OR I D A TE R R I TOR Y 513 8. An Indian is not punishable for merely crossing the boundary line into the white settlements, unless he commits offence while there (see 14 sectionâ€”Law of intercourse).â€ 9. Any moderate expense incurred in the necessary intercourse with the Indians will be paid by the Governor of the Territory; but as the appropriation is very limited, great care will be taken to incur as little as possible. 10"" Respectable Indians visiting the post on business or otherwise, may be furnished with rations to a moderate amountâ€”none, however ought to be issued except when they are indispensably necessaryâ€” nor should frequent or unnecessary visits be encouraged. I enclose herewith copies of the law of intercourse and the supplementary law passed at the late session of congress, for your information and government. While you continue to attend to Indian Affairs, you will correspond with Gov"" Duval, and keep him informed of your proceedings. The Indian Agent has been ordered to Florida, and it is expected he will relieve you from this duty in a short time.â€ J. C. C.",1822,August,21,1822-08-21,DEPARTMENT OF WAR,575,1822.0821

Preston, one of the Commissioners appointed to ascertain claims and titles to land, has not yet arrived, and we have been unable, from any information which has reached us, to make any confident calculations in the subject.â€ It has been stated upon the credit of a letter written from Norfolk, that he will be here in the fall, and that it is expected he will be appointed the Surveyor General of Florida. Colo. Preston, no doubt, merits any office which could be conferred upon him; but we should lament being deprived of his cooperation as a Commissioner. We also regret it, as it may produce some delay in filling his vacancy, which will have subjected two Commissioners to the performance of all the duties assigned to a full board. In order to avoid any further uncertainty and delay, and secure the cooperation of a full board, we have taken the liberty, in the event of Colo. Preston's receiving the appointment of Surveyor General, respectfully to recommend Joseph M. White of this plaice, as his successor. Mâ€ White received an appointment as a member of the Legislative Council of Florida, and has since been elected as Secretary to the Board of Commissioners. He is well acquainted with the Spanish language, and for science and legal acquirements, possesses a highly respectable reputation. Since his arrival in Florida, he has devoted a portion of his attention to the jurisprudence of the country, and if so fortunate as to receive the appointment, would be enabled to afford to the board the most efficient assistance. From his acquaintance with the laws and ordinances of the Spanish government, we have no hesitation in saying, that he is well qualified for the station, and that his appointment would meet with the public approbation. The utmost confidence may be reposed in his integrity, as well as in his talents, and competency to do ample justice to the United States and the claimants.â€” A sincere desire that the duties which have devolved upon us should be discharged with fidelity, and the objects of our commission accomplished as speedily and successfully as possible, are the considerations which have induced us to address you upon this subject. We therefore hope, that it may not be considered as obtrusive, but as an act resulting from our best wishes to subserve the interests of the government.â€” With sentiments of the highest respect, We are y. mo. obt.

"NA:OIA, SW Lets. Sent, Bk. E",Correspondence,THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR DUVAL,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,GOVERNOR DUVAL,"GOV* WILLIAM P. DUVALL, Florida. Pensacola SIR, Your letter of the 3"" instant has been received.â€ I approve of the measures which you have adopted upon the subject of Indian Affairs. My letter to you of the 19th instantâ€ will apprize you of the causes which have delayed to this period any definitive arrangement in relation to the Indians in Florida, and of the measures now proposed to be taken to effect that object. The time which you have appointed for a meeting with the Indians is a very proper one, as it will afford time for the Indian Agent to reach his post and make any preparatory arrangements which may be necessary previous to the assembling of the Indians. If it should suit you to attend the meeting as the Commissioner on the part of the United States to treat with the Indians, you are authorised to do so, and you will be allowed at the rate of $8 a day for the time you may be actually engaged on that duty, which will be paid on your certificate of honor as to the time actually engaged. If it should not be convenient for you to act, you will, as soon as practicable, name some suitable person to this Department to be appointed for that purpose, and I would suggest whether the services of Captain Bell, who from his temporary employment in the Indian Department in Florida has acquired some knowledge of the Indians could not be advantageously employed in this way. It appears by the extract of General Jacksons letter enclosed to you with my letter of the 19* inst: that the point designated by him as the most proper for the concentration of the Indians might in some degree interfere with the grant to Forbes & Co.: If the Indian title to FL OR I D A TERRITOR Y 519 the Country claimed by this grant has been extinguished, care must be taken in making the arrangements for the location of the Indians, not to embarrass the government by an interference with it; but if the Indian title has not been extinguished, there will be no difficulty on that score. The Commissioners appointed to settle claims to land in Florida will perhaps be able to give you satisfactory information on this subject. I am aware that the funds assigned to your superintendency are scant, and will require the most rigid economy to render them available, even for the ordinary expenses of the Indian Departmentâ€”the allowance is however as liberal for that purpose as the appropriation would admit of. An additional allowance will be made for the extra expense which it may be necessary to incur in consequence of the proposed treaty, and I have to request you will transmit to me as early as practicable an estimate of the probable amount of such expense, and if deemed reasonable funds will be forwarded to enable you to meet it. In relation to M'. Richards the Interpreter, I enclose herewith an extract of a letter from this Department to Captain Bell, authorizing him to give M*. Richards the appointment of Interpreter with an annual compensation of $365."" You will therefore settle the account of M'. Richards at this rate, and if he has not been regularly appointed an Indian Interpreter in the service of the government, you are authorized to appoint him, as one will be absolutely necessary, and he appears to be a man of good character. He will perform his duties under your directions. To enable you to pay him for past services I have directed the sum of $500 to be remitted to you, which will leave a surplus to be applied to other purposes. In July 1818, not long after the termination of the Semenole War, the Indian Chief Blunt, to whom you refer, visited the seat of Government in company with M'. Hambly, and upon a representation of his services by General Jackson, he was allowed and paid therefor the sum of $1000, which was deemed an adequate compensation, consequently he can have no just claim now on the government for the same services. Since my answer to you of the 19* inst in relation to your proposition for opening a road between Pensacola and S*Augustine, I have thought it probable that the expense of merely opening the road, would not be great, and if you will transmit to me an estimate of the probable amount of the cost, including the extra pay of the soldiers (an estimate of which you may obtain from the Quarter Master) I will decide upon the subject, and apprize you of the decision.""

"NA:SF, 17 Cong., 2 sess.: C*",Memorial,MEMORIAL TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL,,,"To His Excellency James Munroe President of the United States.â€” Your Memorialists, constituting the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, beg leave to submit to the President of the United States, a statement of the prominent subjects of general interest to the inhabitants of this Territory for which they have been appointed to Legislate, and in the destinies of which they feel a deep public and individual interest. The Legislative Council will approach the topics, to which they would most respectfully solicit your attention with that frankness and sincerity which Citizens have the pride and satisfaction to assume in addressing the chief magistrate of our grand confederacy; and through him the Congress of the United States. After a long and protracted negotiation the United States acquired the Floridas, an acquisition which it was then supposed would form one of the brightest epochs in the history of the distinguished administration that negotiated and the Congress that sanctioned the treaty of Cession, and enable the ceded inhabitants with the influx of population and wealth, to fulfil the high destiny to which the God of nature seemed to have assigned this highly favoured Country. Candour however obliges us to say that the act of Congress, for the Organazation of the Government of this Territory, although calculated to remedy many of the defects of the provincial establishment from which it was lately emancipated, was nevertheless not so favorable as we had a right to expect, when we contemplate the value of the acquisition, the commercial and agricultural advantages of the Country, its soils, bays, rivers and harbours, its important resources and energies when developed and called into action and above all its exposed situation possessing a coast of twelve hundred miles, constituting the natural boundary of the most important part of the Union and liable to the incursions of any foreign invader or lawless domestic enemy, whose cupidity and enterprizing avarice might lead them to desolate our towns and plunder our spare population. Your Memorialists do not in the remotest degree, charge the neglect to a want of that careful and provident attention to the interests of the native and adopted Citizens of the United States which has always characterized the policy of those who are intrusted with the Guardianship of our rights, but a want of the requisite information in regard to the necessities and wants of our Territory, deprived as it has been of representation to Congress. The first subject to which we would particularly invite your attention and that of the Congress of the United States, is one of as much national concern, as solicitude in reference to the immediate prosperity of this Territoryâ€”It will be recollected that the late government of Spain over these provinces considered East and West Florida, as two distinct dependancies, from a Connexion of which they could discover no immediate benefit to Spain and consequently the settlements were confined to the vicinity of Sâ€™ Augustine and Pensacola more particularly in West Florida where the settlement of the Country was circumscribed by an apprehension of Indian hostility the effect has been to prevent the establishment of a road, from the Capitals of the above provinces to each other, or to the interior; and as we are at present situated the nearest practicable road from one to the other by land, is seven hundred and fifty Miles, through Alabama and Georgia, and the water communication round the Cape is as difficult as a trip to Liverpool or Bourdeauxâ€”a conclusion however unfavorable to the conjunction of the two provinces in a Territory or State, Cannot be drawn from this fact, the distance not being more than three hundred and fifty or four hundred miles, through a healthy fine Country, a large proportion of which your Memorialists are induced to believe for fertility is not surpassed by any land in the Southern Country, a slight view of the geographical situation of the Country, its local and political connexion with the United States, will demonstrate the policy and necessity of preserving the connexion of the Floridas, and also dictate the propriety of laying out a road from Pensacola to S' Augustine from which our government in addition to the lasting improvement of her Territory for the labour and expence, will derive more than an equivalent from the sale of public lands, which will be much inhanced in value by such an improvement. Your memorialists would therefore request that your excellency would direct some intelligent Officers of the Engineer Corps, to explore the country and mark out a road from Pensacola to S* Augustine"" and adopt such measures as to your Excellency may seem fit, to have the same opened in Conformity with their report and also that they be directed to solicit some suitable place, in the Mickasuky Country or on the Suwanny River or the adjacent Country for the permanent seat of Government of Florida"" and make report thereof to the Governor of this Territory to be laid before the next Legislative Council. Whilst we are on the subject of the Establishment of public roads, so nearly Connected with the growth, wealth and prosperity of this Territory, we would also take the liberty to recommend to the General Government the necessisty and practibility of opening the road from S*Augustine into Georgia known by the appellation of the Kings road,â€ which was open'd at great expence by the British Government, and could at this time be reopened with very little labour and will afford a communication to facilitate the entercourse between that part of the Territory and the Southern Statesâ€” the establishment of this road was deemed an object of the utmost importance to the province of East Florida by the British Government, Your Memorialists are induced to believe that the policy and necessity of such measure will be more strongly felt by the Government of the United States. Your Memorialists would beg leave particularly to direct the attention of the Congress of the United States to the necessity of erecting light Houses at Pensacola and S* Augustine"" and also to provide some law upon the subject of wrecking at the penensula of Florida,â€ which is now in the hands of foreigners, and subject to the absolute controul of the colonies of Great Britain and Spain, and is frequently made the pretext for Piracy and smuggling. Another subject to which the Legislative Council will call the attention of Congress is the organization of the judiciary in this Territory, by reference to the Act of Congressâ€ it will be found that two District Courts are established, one in East and the other in West Florida, those courts are vested with jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases without an appeal from their decisions to any other tribunal, only when they entertain jurisdiction in their Federal Capacity, it follows therefore that the act of Congress have vested in one Judge power over the lives, liberties and properties of the Citizens of this Territory without providing for an appeal or writ of error to Correct a Judgment rendered by misconception of the law, partiality, or judicial impetuosity, whatever confidence we may repose in the virtues of our Judges, or the upright integrity of the American Bench, * See act approved May 24, 1824, 4 STAT. 30. Your memorialists conceive that it is a novel and dangerous power, inconsistent with the policy of our government, and contrary to the usual course in relation to all other Territories, in all of which if they are not mistaken three judges have been appointed who were required to hold Courts in different parts of the Territories, and once or twice a year hold a court of Errors and appeals, in all cases arising under the Territorial laws. Two Judges are incompetent to form such a connective tribunal. to supply the deficiencies in the judiciary system as regulated by the act of Congress the Legislative Council considered it incumbent upon them to establish inferior Courtsâ€ as a temporary expedient making it the duty of the Judges of the Inferior Courts to hold pleas in the Several Counties with an appeal from their decision to the District Court of the United States: we believe this course to be indispensible to the convenience of large settlements remote from S"" Augustine and Pensacola, a contrary policy would have subjected them to great inconvenience and in many instances would have been tantamount to a denial of justice, We considered it necessary to prevent Crime by its speedy punishment, to restrain the refractory, to protect the weak from the oppression of the strong, and thus to insure virtue and humanity among our Citizens, and accomplish the great end of society, the happiness of the peopleâ€” The salaries of the Judges of the Inferior Courts amount to two thousand four hundred Dollars, and as we are in the first grade of Territorial government, we have reason to expect that Congress will make an appropriation of that sumâ€”and also provide for the appointment of another Judge to reside at the seat of Government, which will do away the necessity of a longer Continuance of the Inferior Courts.â€ There is another topic of considerable interest and magnitude to this Territory and the United States upon which your memorialists would respectfully express their opinions on the present occasion. In consequence of the great extent of sea Coast by which Florida is bounded, and the consequent exposure to which she is subjected, the speedy settlement of the Country will readily present itself to your excellency as an object of the most important consideration. In order to give that strength and security to Territories thus peculiarly situated, emigration should be invited to them by every advisable means, within the controul of the General Government. To accomplish this desirable purpose it may be considered of the first moment, that the claims to land of every description should be promptly ascertained and adjusted.â€”Upon this subject your Memorialists would with all the respect and Confidence due to the Constituted Authorities of the Union, recommend that the powers of the Commissioners should be inlarged, relative to claims upon which they are authorized to pronounce a final decision.â€ Your Memorialists would also suggest the propriety of referring the larger grants to the investigation and determination of the Judicial Tribunals.â€ Were the existence of this power thus vested in our courts, and transferred from our national Councils it is confidently believed, that much expence would be avoided as well as more ample and speedy Justice administered to all parties concerned. The members of the judiciary residing in the Territory and having obtained an acquaintance with the laws and ordinances of the government from which the claims emenated, they must necessarily be much better qualified to pronounce an opinion than any tribunal differently constituted; from the decissions of the courts here an appeal might be given to the Supreme Court, and thus the validity of titles decided by the constitutional arbiter the judiciary which would eminently Contribute to secure the rights of the United States and the claimants. Untill these difficulties are obviated it cannot be expected that emigration should be successfully directed to the Territory of Florida, large tracts of land are in some places covered by private claims, before the proprietors can make any permanent disposition of them to settlers, by which a dense and efficient population can be obtained it is indispensably necessary that they should be free from all incumbrance and litigation. This end can be most speedily, cheaply and certainly accomplished by the judicial Tribunals of our Country.â€”Next to bringing the public lands into market at an earl]y period, your Memorialists consider the prompt and fi[na]l decision of land claims as an object of the highest Consideration, upon it, not only depends the growth and prosperity of this Territory, but the effectation of these valuable purposes for which the United States obtained their Cession by the late Treaty with Spain. In conclusion your Memorialists would beg leave to represent to your Excellency the superior advantages of the Harbour of Pensacola over any other in the Gulph of Mexico south of New Orleans and suggest the policy of selecting it as a Naval Depot by the government of the United States,"" although engineers have been appointed to make a survey of the harbour who are amply competent to form a correct estimate of its importance; yet it is to be hoped, that the suggestions of your Memorialists may not be considered obtrusive but received with complacency as the offspring of a lively interest in the welfare of this Territory and of the United States. From a survey that has been made of the Harbour of Pensacola under the orders of the general Government, it is understood by your Memorialists that at the lowest water vessels drawing not more than twenty one and a half feet may cross the Bar and enter the harbour with perfect safety, the medium depth of water between the highest and lowest tide may be confidently estimated at two additional feet making in the aggregate twenty three and a half feet.â€”It is believed from the best advice which has been obtained upon the subject, that this depth of water on the Bar is sufficient for the entrance of vessels of any description, save those of the largest class; the locality of the bay is likewise such as to secure every facility to the entrance and departure of vessels. The opposite extremes of its oblong form extends in a Northeastwardly and southwesterly direction, which happily corresponds with the general range of winds so as to subject vessels to very little delay in their arrival and departure. After Wessels have entered the bay they have every assurance of the most perfect security even in the most violent gales, it is completely land locked by main land and the Island of S"" Rosa, it uncommonly capacious and its bottom affording a stiff tenacious clay constituting a safe and excellent anchorage. From S' Carlos De Barrancas to the opposite point of S' Rosa's Island is computed to be about three fourths of a Mile, with suitable fortifications at those two opposite positions, it is confidently believed by military Gentlemen of science who have visited them and expressed an opinion that no vessel could pass into the Bay without receiving a fatal injury, the guns of both fortifications could be brought to bear upon it with so much Certainty and effect as to insure destruction. Every examination which has been made of these commanding stations has resulted in the decided opinion that it can be much more easily defended than any other on the Gulph, if not on the whole of the Atlantic Coast. A faithful Topography of Pensacola and the adjacent Country will demonstrate that it may be very effectually protected from the inroads of the enemy by land. In the rear of the Town at [a] distance of about half a mile the high lands are present[ed] upon which Military works may be constructed to advantage so as completely to command the whole space intervening between them and the bay. A Single fortification strongly and Judiciously built would successfully bear upon the entrance into the Town in every direction, there is probably no other station on the Southern Coast, which could be defended by land with so small a number of Troops or at less expence. Independently of the facility with which Pensacola may be defended, if reliance is exclusively reposed in regular troops. There are other prominent considerations which powerfully recommend to the attention of the General Government this results from its immediate connexion with New Orleans, and its contiguity with most of the States on the Mississippi River, in cases of emergency and invasion should it become necessary to call the aid of the Militia for the protection of this place they can be readily obtained from Louisiana Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama owing to an advantage from a water Communication, they may be conveyed to Pensacola in a short time, and comparatively with small expence to the General Government; Your Memorialists are induced to believe that half of the expenditures of the late war were included in the item of transportation much would be saved on this score were Pensacola selected as a Naval station not only in the transportation of Soldiery but also in provisions and Munitions of War. This desirable object would be more completely accomplished should ever a Communication be opened between the Bay of Pensacola and the Mississippi and Mobille rivers; Another prominent advantage in favor of Pensacola which gives it elevated claims on the patronage of the Government is that it is distinguished for the salubrity of atmosphere and mildness of climate it is a situation where the troops may always calculate on enjoying good health, and where it is represented that breadstuffs and other provisions continue almost as long in a perfect state of preservation as in most of the northern ports of the United States. In addition to this your memorialists will take the present occasion to remark that a military force stationed at Pensacola, would in time of war give efficient aid in the defence of New Orleans as well as additional security to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama by presenting a formidable barrier by which inroads through West Florida would be checked and prevented. This assistance could not with any certainty be obtained from Tampa Bay, and no other position it is believed can be selected south of Pensacola which promises the other important advantages, we have described in Consequence of it remaining a great distance from a dense population and the difficulties of transportation, it cannot be so Conveniently connected with the adjoining States and must rely for defence almost entirely upon regular troops a much larger number of which will be necessarily required. The occupation of Pensacola with the necessary fortifications is calculated to afford a more complete command over the commerce of the Gulph of Mexico than any other position which could be selected on the southern Coast; with this peculiar advantage, the united states would exclude the shipping of an enemy probably from the only port in Florida in which they could anchor with safety owing to the violence of the West India Gales, Your Memorialists are of the opinion that there is no other Harbour save that of the Havanna in which they could ride with security during a storm. But the benefits arising from the selection of [Pen]sacola as a Naval Statioln] are not entirely of a negative] character, we should not only be enabled to exclude the hostile Armaments of Foreign Nations but our own Vessels could be protected from capture and disaster; the Harbour of Pensacola will always be a place of secure retreat, a station from which expeditions may be fitted out without interruption and from which the West India commerce of an enemy might receive the most successfull annoyance. Were New Orleans assailed, Pensacola would be competent to afford Cooperation for its defence both by land and water which could not fail to excite in the enemy the most fearful apprehensions; by our vigorous and well directed efforts her commerce would be cut off, her detatchments Captured and in the end her surrender and retreat accomplished, the security of this place then is believed by Your Memorialists to be inseperably connected with the prosperity and defence of New Orleans and the Contiguous States. We therefore pray the attention of your Excellency to the subjects upon which we have taken the liberty to remark and be assured that those who give a different Account of our Territory are ignorant of its resources or wantonly misrepresent it.

C. Bronough President of the Council and the chief clerk John Coppinger Connor have fallen victims to this diseaseâ€”almost all the American population of Pensacola have died. It being impossible to publish the Laws of this Territory according to the act of Congress and distribute the same without the funds for this purposeâ€”I shall be under the necessity of drawing upon you to meet these objects for the printer here has not funds to carry on the work unless I become responsible to those on whom he must depend for credit for the necessary materials. The necessary expences of the Legislative Council including the rent of a room, stationary, Clerk hire, tables &c must be paid forthwith as they are claims that will not admit of delayâ€”I do not believe that the printing and distribution of the Laws together with every other incidental expense occasioned by the Council, will exceed three thousand three hundred dollarsâ€”I make this estimate from the several amounts fixed by the Legislative Council for clerk hire, printing &c which I know to be unusually moderateâ€”It will be a saving to the Government to permit the accounts to be settled by the governor or secretary, as they know what each individual is entitled toâ€”I do not hesitate to assure you that whenever the individuals send on their accounts to you, from this Territory, they never fail to make them more than equal to their servicesâ€”this I believe to be the fact, except in the case of the Secretary Co' Walton, who, in my humble opinion ought to be allowed at least six hundred dollars more than his account rendered to youâ€”There are many small claims for services due to various individuals in East Floridaâ€” and there are still existing claims here, for confining and maintaining prisoners in jail, for which no compensation has ever been made to the jailerâ€”a similar claim also exists in East Floridaâ€”and both at Pensacola and S*Augustine rooms have been rented for the purpose of holding Courts, and as offices for the Clerksâ€”I would submit it therefore, sir to you, whether it is not the interest of the Government to place funds in the hands of the Governor of this Territory to discharge these claims as I am sure it will be done for much less when the Governor himself looks into the accounts and examines the claims, than if the claimants were paid at the seat of Governmentâ€” should you think with me on this subject and authorize me to draw on you for this purpose, I will take care that no exorbitant or improper claim shall be paid and that proper vouchers shall be taken and returned to you, shewing specifically how the funds have been applied. I have the pleasure to inform you that the Spanish inhabitants are daily becoming more and more satisfied with our Government, and that throughout the Territory the utmost order and harmony prevail among the old and new inhabitants. The code of Laws enacted by the Legislative Council, I believe well calculated for the situation of the Territory. I have made it my business to conciliate as far as my duty would permit the Spanish inhabitants, and I believe have succeeded. In the distribution of the various little offices of the Territory, I have given to the ancient inhabitants wherever I found them qualified their due proportionâ€”I trust that this course will meet the approbation of the President and yourself. The Civil Government of the Territory is now pretty well organized, and I am now endeavouring under our late law to place the Militia on a respectable footing, which I expect to finish in a few days. An absence from Kentucky, where my family resides, for a year past, with the exception of ten days last spring on my way to Pensacola has occasioned me some serious pecuniary losses, it therefore becomes indispensible that I should return to Kentucky to arrange my private affairs, before I go on to S*Augustine where the Legislative Council is to meet in the spring, this I would not do, if my presence was likely to be necessary before my return ""â€“You will be pleased therefore in my absence to address your communications to Co.'

From the information which I have obtained from that part of the Country lying between the Suwanny and the Alochua, now inhabited by the Indians, I have little doubt it is the richest and most valuable part of all Floridaâ€”in fact there are no bodies of good land in either East or West Florida but in that region of countryâ€”It will be a serious misfortune to this Territory if the Indians are permitted to occupy this tract of countryâ€”It will sustain a larger population than all Florida beside, and from the sale of the lands in that quarter only can the United States hope to realize the money which they paid for Floridaâ€”If that country is ceded to the Indians, Florida can be of no importance except only for its few sea ports.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:AL",Correspondence,A RESIDENT INHABITANT OF EAST FLORIDA TO THESECRETARY OF STATE,A RESIDENT INHABITANT OF EAST FLORIDA,THESECRETARY OF STATE,"Believing that the Government of the United States are very illy informed of the real situation of public affairs in this Territory, the writer of this letter takes the liberty to mention a few facts from which the Government will draw such inferences as seem naturally to result from them. 1. It is an undeniable fact that Governor Duval has become extremely unpopular throughout all Florida. The Spanish inhabitants, to a man, are dissatisfied with his conductâ€”his name is now never mentioned here without censure. His conduct in regard to the election of Bronaugh was shameful in the highest degreeâ€”his conduct was equally so in regard to the election of the Mayor of Pensacola, endeavouring, by the influence of his office, to force upon the inhabitants as mayor, a Stranger from New Orleans of no sort of considerationâ€”his scheme was defeated by the united opposition of all the Spanish inhabitants and almost every upright American in the place. 2. Two of the members of the Legislative Council, M. Law and Major Murray, have just arrived here from Pensacola, which place they left about the 21"" of Septr. The Governor was in a few days to set out for Kentucky, without meeting the Indians at St. Marks, as he had publickly announced was his intention. He is not to come again into Florida until May, and has declared his intention not to move his family into Florida at all. Thus, he will receive $4000 a year, his salary as Governor and Indian Agent together, reside in Kentucky and only come into Florida a couple of months in a year to attend the Legislative Council. It is the general opinion here, and very freely expressed by all classes, that by obtaining the office of Governor he only meant to make a Job of it. Very great dissatisfaction is universally felt and loudly expressed on this occasion. They people here expect the Governor to reside with his family in the Territoryâ€”to consider it his home. This Country never can flourish under the system which has hitherto been pursued in regard to itâ€” 3. Judge Smith arrived here about a fortnight ago, but he can do nothing as a Judge never having been sworn into officeâ€”and that stupid act of congress made for the government of Florida, requires that he should take his oath of office only before the Governorâ€” He is not disposed to run after the Governor into Kentucky, consequently there can be no Court here until next springâ€”unless Congress will graciously please to rectify their blunders, and authorise the Judge to take his oath before any Magistrate competent to administer one. If this be done immediately on the meeting of congressâ€” the Territorial Court may yet be opened in January next. 4. There is no Marshal yet here to serve the process of the Court. 5. The Sheriff of this County is unable to give the bonds required by the act of the Legislative Council, consequently cannot enter upon the duties of his officeâ€”and it will take at least 70 or 80 days, even if the Sheriff were to resign, which he will not do although he cannot act, before another could be appointed by M. Walton the Secretary, acting for Governor Duval. The Coroner appointed has not yet been able to give the bonds requiredâ€”So that we are absolutely without the means of administering Justice either Civil or Criminal in this Section of the Territory. 4. There is no Jail here nor any public or private building suitable for one, except the Fort, which indeed is fit for nothing else, and would make a very good Jail. But the Military keep possession of it, although they have not the least use for itâ€”all the officers and soldiers are quartered at the Barracks, which have been repaired at great expense to the U. S. Half a dozen soldiers are marched up to the fort every morning and relieved the next morningâ€”and this is all that the Military do with the fort. Surely it would be more useful as a prison for debtors and criminalsâ€” There are many other matters intimately connected with the welfare and prosperity of this Country, to which the attention of the Government ought to be directed. The fundamental error in the Act of Congress for the government of the Floridas, was the uniting of them under one Government. If congress were unwilling to go to the expense of two territorial governments, they ought to have annexed West Florida to Alabama. Nature and every consideration of interest and public good demand it. The two Floridas never can flourish under one government. There is no unity of feeling or interest between them. They are too distant from each otherâ€”that is, the two Capitalsâ€”and neither will be settled half so fast if kept under the present system of Gov"" that each would, if Pensacola was attached to Alabama. Public roads and bridges are indispensably necessary for the settlement of East Floridaâ€”and as Congress have forbidden the Local Legislature to tax the public lands, these roads and bridges never can be made from the revenue arising from taxes on private property. East Florida is capable of sustaining a very dense populationâ€”but alas! What encouragement is there for settlers to come among usâ€”a Country without law or Justiceâ€”where scarcely an acre of land is not liable to litigation, and no Courts to determine the titles. The land commissioners, it is said, have done nothing at Pensacola and although they were to come here next January, either cannot or will not come till next May. Having chosen this Country as my future abode, through life, I hope the deep interest I feel in its welfare and prosperity will excuse the freedom of these remarksâ€” A resident Inhabitant of East Florida TO THE HON.

Recd 5th Nov. 1822. [Enclosure] An Article from the East Florida Herald [October 1822) THE ELECTION. The polls being now finally closed, we must wait for the return from West Florida, to ascertain the result of the election. Meanwhile, it may not be improper to take a brief view of some extraordinary circumstances, which have attended this election; and to call the attention of the public to certain facts closely connected with it. It is not the least of the blessings of a free Government, that the press is open to all fair and candid animadversion on the conduct of public officers, however eminent their station or their talents. Not only the conduct of public officers, but the acts of private individuals, in matters of public concern, are just and legitimate subjects of investigation and comment. This is the great advantage of a free press, to the rights and interests of the community. Errors and abuses, which otherwise would be repeated are, by this means, corrected and repressed; and the wrong-doers made to know, that if they do not alter the course of their conduct, punishment and the indignation of an injured people await them. Impressed with these principles we shall proceed to notice: 1. The conduct of his excellency the Governor, in regard to the election. 2. The conduct of certain individuals recently appointed to office by his Excellency. First, then, with regard to the Governor. It is an undeniable fact, that previously to the appointment of the Governor, at Washington, Dr. Bronaugh then being there, openly declared his intention to become a candidate for delegate to congress from this Territory; and avowed that he should avail himself of the votes of the common soldiers to effect his object. It is another fact, not less susceptible of positive proof, that Governor Duval, previously and subsequently to his appointment, did pledge himself to support the election of Dr. Bronaugh. What were the motives or inducements to make this pledge, whether a high opinion entertained of the virtues and abilities, or the peculiar fitness of that gentleman for the office, or a belief that he was popular in Floridaâ€”or something else, we shall not, at present, inquire: we only state the fact. On the return of Dr. Bronaugh to Pensacola, his name with high commendations, was announced, as a candidate in the news paper printed there. Col. Barnett was subsequently mentioned, as another candidate; but it was notorious that the Governor gave his sole and decided support to the former. The Legislative Council, owing to delay in the arrival of many of the members, did not assemble until the 22d day of July. Congress are to meet on the first Monday of December, consequently no time ought to have been lost in passing an act by the council to provide for, and fix the period of the election of the delegate. It is well known that it takes the mail at least thirty days, to pass between Pensacola and St. Augustine. The election, therefore could not, with propriety have been delayed longer than the first day of October, to admit of the returns in time for the delegate to arrive at Washington, on the meeting of Congress. One would, therefore, naturally have supposed that this subject would have been the first to which the Governor, in his speech, would have called the attention of the Council. Instead of which we find him perfectly silent on this matter. The Legislative Council entered upon other businessâ€”passed many other laws, which might just as well have been delayed until after the passing of the election law;â€”and finally did not pass that law, until the 12th. day of August: too late to allow the inhabitants of East Florida, to have notice of it and make the necessary arrangements for the election. It may perhaps, be said, that this was the fault of the Council, and not of the Governor. We answer: that it was the fault of both. the Governor is surely to blame for not recommending in his speech, the early attention of the Council to this subject. We shall now notice some extraordinary features in this act, for which we hold the Governor not less censurable than the majority of the council; for he was bound, by the duties of his office, to refuse his assent to the law if defective or improper in any part of it.â€”The first objection to the act is, that the 10th section is so worded that the common soldiers in the Territory are intended to be allowed to Vote: that was the avowed object of the majority. The next, and assuredly a very strong objection is, that the votes are to be given viva voce. We shall not dwell upon the gross impropriety of these provisions in the act, as the subject has already received the pointed and severe reprobation of the public. But it is evident to every dispassionate mind that the tendency of these provisions was to secure the election of Bronaugh, with the aid of the soldiers. The giving of the votes viva voce would necessarily take away all freedom in many of the electors. Hence, the officers of the army devoted to Dr. Bronaugh, might, by that means, compel the troops to vote for him; and certain persons appointed to civil offices by the Governor, might also control the votes of many of the citizens. But this is not the worst that was done, apparently with a view to promote the election of the Governor's favourite candidate. We find it devolving on his Excellency himself to make the selection of places where the election was to be held. He named in his proclamation six places in West Florida, and only three in East Florida, although the latter is at least four times greater in extent than the former. By this arrangement a great proportion of the voters, in East Florida, would be obliged to travel from thirty to fifty miles, and a considerable number, upwards of a hundred, to come to any poll.â€”This consequence has ensued; that not one fourth part of the population of this section of the Territory have been able to vote at all. Again, at the Cowford, where it was natural to suppose that a great many votes would be taken if the people had attended, instead of appointing the judges of the election, at that poll, from the neighborhood, where many respectable planters resided, only one Judge was appointed in that quarter, another 25 miles off, and a third at the distance of 50 miles. The consequence of which was, that one of the Judges, being sick, could not attend and the other came some hours after the poll was opened; and, to the astonishment of every body refused to act.â€”but of this more hereafter. On this occasion we cannot forbear to contrast the conduct of Mr. Dawson with that of Judge Reynolds. The former was obliged to act alone, as a Judge of the election, and conducted himself with strict impartiality and the greatest propriety thro'out. In vain may the defenders of the Governor attempt to excuse this part of his conduct, by pretending that he was ignorant of the situation and extent of the country, and the names of suitable persons to be appointed Judges. A list of six places in East Florida, with the names of five or six persons, at each place, qualified in every respect, for the office of Judges was sent to him by respectable men in this City, long before the election law was passed. Besides, he had Capt. Hanham with him, who well knew the whole country and the inhabitants, and who could have given him all the necessary information on this subject.â€”We impute no impure motives to his Excellency in making this extraordinary distinction between East and West Florida; but with the before mentioned facts in view, it seems impossible, for any candid and reflecting person, not to draw inferences unfavourable to his impartial conduct, in regard to the election. We would fain believe, and we indulge the hope of seeing it manifested by his future conduct, that he is the Governor of Florida, and not the supporter of any particular party or faction. We shall now make a few remarks on the conduct of some of the public officers, recently appointed by his Excellency. The first gentleman whom we find figuring in this election, is the Sheriff of St. Johns County. He leaves his seat in the Legislative Council comes express here, travelling throâ€™ the country between the St. Marys and the St. Johns, distributing Dr. Bronaugh's circular addresses in every direction, and using his utmost influence and endeavors to induce the people to vote for that candidate, giving them to understand that he was the Governor's candidate; and that it would be highly displeasing to his Excellency if they should not support Dr. Bronaugh. He did moreâ€”he attended the poll, at the Cowford, and there zealously and actively electioneered for Bronaugh, until the news of his death reached that place, when he immediately returned home. The sheriff of the new County called Duval, a Mr. Dill or Dell, as he writes his name, took a similar active part in the election, in favour of Bronough. He brought up with him to the Cowford a number of his neighbours, who had never before heard of the name of Dr. Bronaugh; and if the reports of respectable persons, who were present, may be believed this Mr. Dell and his associate all behaved in the most riotous and disorderly manner. So determined was Mr. Dell, in the support of Bronough, that after the news of his death reached the poll, and no one doubted of it, he swore his friends should vote for him, dead or alive, and some of them actually did, the next day, give in their votes for him although they admitted he was dead. We do not pretend to question the right of a Governor or a sheriff to vote for whom he may please, and to express an opinion in favour of any one candidate, in prefernce to another, but we do say, that we think it highly improper in a Governor or a Sheriff to take a warm and active part in any election. The Sheriff's business at a poll, when he attends one, is to keep the peace and promote good orderâ€”not to be instrumental in disturbing the peace, much less to put himself at the 301867â€“67â€“36 head of a riotous gang, and encourage and protect them in their disorderly conduct. The next person whose conduct at the election we feel obliged to notice, though it gives us much pain to do so, because we had previously entertained a high opinion of his character and respectabilty is Mr. Reynolds, late one of the Judges of the County Court, and recently appointed a Justice of the Peace by his Excellency the Governor. This gentleman was appointed one of the Judges of the election at the Cowford; but instead of being there at the opening of the poll, he did not arrive till the afternoon of the first day, and then refused to act, giving as a reason, that one of the Judges had opened the poll without waiting for him. By this conduct, Mr. Reynolds has undoubtedly incurred the penalty of 200 dollars, imposed by the law; and any one may prosecute him for the same and receive one half. He however, remained at the poll, and in conjunction with Mr. Dell, as we are informed, electioneered for Bronough, until the news came of his death. He then discouraged the people from voting at all, pretending that the election would be void, because only one Judge held the pollâ€”so that a great number who came there actually went away without giving in their votes. Now, we would make the same observations in regard to the conduct of Judge Reynolds, which have been made in respect to that of the Sheriffs. No one denies his right to express his opinion in favour of this or that candidate; but we do consider it highly indecorous, in his situation, as one of the Judges of the election, to have been active and busy in the support of any particular candidate. We however repeat, that we impute no corrupt motives to any of the above named gentlemen, but attribute their acts to a highly improper and blameable zeal, to effect their objectâ€”the election of their favuorite candidate. We shall now close these remarks, with this observation; that we sincerely declare that we feel not the least animosity or personal illwill towards any of the persons whose conduct we have deemed it fit to notice. For his Excellency the Goveror, we entertain a very high respect and regard; but we consider it a duty incumbent upon every honest and upright member of the community, who feels an interest in the honour and welfare of this Country, to enter his solemn protest against the measures and conduct which have been pursued by the persons before mentioned, in the hope and expectation that similar abuses will not be again practised.

OVERTON,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR; In consequence of the prevailance of the yellow fever at Pensacola, our duties, as Commissioners, have been suspended for more than two months. Such has been the fury and fatality with which it raged, that very few Americans who were attacked, have survived. Out of a population of about 1,500 or 2,000, between 2 or 300 have fallen victims. There was no safety but in flight, and we were so fortunate as to retire at a period sufficiently early, to avoid its ravages. We sincerely regret the necessity which imperatively urged the adoption of this measure, and the consequent postponement in the prosecution of our duties, but it was altogether unavoidable. Had we remained in Pensacola, we should, probably have shared the fate of those who failed to remove, without any prospect of accomplishing any valuable purpose. The population was flying in every direction where they could obtain accommodation, and those who remained in the city, were, in numerous instances, either assailed themselves, or engaged in discharging towards those who were, the ordinary offices of duty and humanity. Such was the general alarm and distress, that business of almost every description was suspended. Under such circumstances, it would have been impossible to make any progress in the adjudication of land claims. The disease has nearly altogether subsided; but we are apprehensive, it proceeds more from the want of subjects, than from any other cause. About a week since, the last cases which proved fatal, have been represented to be as virulent as any that have occurred. The weather yet continues warm at Pensacola, and we are advised, that it will not be safe to return until frost, which may be expected about the middle of next month. The population may be then expected to return to the city, and we may calculate upon being enabled to proceed in the accomplishment of our commission. Since our retirement to the country, all that we have been enabled to perform, has received our attention. The papers submitted, have been mostly recorded.â€” We have considered it our duty to communicate these facts, in order that Congress may adopt such measures as may be necessary to meet them. Owing to the lamentable calamity which has visited the city of Pensacola, our duties will have been interrupted for so great a length of time, that it will be impossible for us to close the business in West Florida, within the time prescribed in the law organizing this Board of Commissioners. It will be absolutely necessary that the sessions should be extended. We would, therefore respectfully suggest, that the subject be submitted to Congress as soon as they shall be convened, so that provision be made to this end as early as possible. It will probably be practicable to pass a supplemental act for this purpose, sufficiently early to reach us before the termination of our session at Pensacola, which is very disirable""â€” We are, with every sentiment of respect, Y' Mo.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS",Correspondence,JUDGE SMITH TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,JUDGE SMITH,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR, In my letter of the first instant "" I had the honour to report my arrival, at this place, on the 29"" of September. Sensible of the feelings which are excited in a Territorial population by the absence of their Civil Officers, I considered it due to the people of East Florida, to repair to my station at this time, & to evince at once, my intention of becoming a permanent resident among themâ€”though aware previously to my departure from Connecticut in August, that it would not be in my power to hold a Court in October, or to do any official act, because Governor Duval, from whom alone, by the Act of Congress,"" I could receive the Oath of Office, was at Pensacola, distant from Augustine by water, in the usual track, about two thousand miles & by land, in the only practised route, through Georgia, seven hundred & fifty. I could not expect therefore, to open my Court till the term of January, before which time it was confidently expected that the Governor, in the exercise of his official duties, would visit Augustine. After my Arrival, & after becoming acquainted with the State of the District, I became satisfied with this result; because sure, that a term of the court at an earlier period, before the promulgation of the code of the Legislative Councilâ€”& while yet not only the forms of Law process, but the laws themselves were uncertain & unknown in East Floridaâ€”could in no respect, advance the essential interests of justice or of the Territoryâ€”That some suits indeed might be commenced, fees charged & court expenses incurred, without the possibility of progressing beneficially one step towards final judgmentâ€”& that in the interval, the laws might be received, forms of practice & rules of Court determined on, and digested views entertained, which would enable the Court to proceed with system, dispatch & usefulness at the January Term. But it has now become my duty Sir, to inform you, that the absence of Governor Duval from the Territory,â€ and the expectation entertained that he will not return to it again till about the first of May, will render it impracticable for me to be sworn into office, either in season for the January or April term of the Court. I take the liberty therefore, to suggest to your consideration, in behalf of the interests of the Territory, the propriety & necessity of legislative provision, at the earliest practicable day of the next session of Congress, empowering some person at this place, or any person, competent to administer oaths generallyâ€”to administer the Oath of Office to me. Such provision Sir, would obviate the difficulty, which may repeatedly occur, from the restriction of this power, as the law at present stands, personally to the Governor.â€ I consider it proper Sir, that the whole Subject may be before you at one view, & that there may be no supposition of neglect on my part, to repeat that my appointment of Judge was not made, till after Govenor Duval left Washingtonâ€”That immediately upon my acceptance, I addressed him in duplicate at Pensacola,"" requesting to know the earliest time at which I might expect to find him in East Florida, where in conversation, previous to my appointment, he had informed me he should be in the course of the then ensuing summer, & where in my letter, I assured him, I would not fail to be at the earliest day which he should name. The Governor in reply, which reached me in August, gave me the information that his intentions were changed, & that he should probably not visit Augustine till subsequent to an Indian treaty, which would occupy some time after the session of the Legislative Council. After this information, if it could have been considered my duty to have travelled in pursuit of the Governor at the expense of a years salary several thousand miles, I still could not have found him in the Territory, as he would have left Pensacola before I could have reached it. I have to offer in apology Sir, for the repetition of former letters contained in this, the doubt arising from distance & the uncertainty of the Mails whether those have yet been receivedâ€”& the certainty of this reaching you safely by Col.

"NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., W 129:ALS",Correspondence,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,"SIR; In consequence of the letter of the Secretary of State, of the 20"" of August,"" in relation to the public buildings, I have requested Col: Clinch to give orders to the Quarter Master, to turn them over to the Executive of this Territory. I presume the Colonel has written to you,"" and enclosed copies of the communications which have passed between us upon the subject. The buildings have not yet been turned over to me; but it is to be expected, that they will be, in a short time, agreeably to the orders of the War Department.â€” It seems, that some little doubt exists, as to what buildings, if any, should be considered of a military character. All the public buildings, except the prison and Hospital, were included within the old British Fort. Under the Spanish Government, the plan of that 15 See post, p. 592. part of the town has been changed; The block houses now stand on the street, or on the public square, and excepting their form, they have nothing of a military character. Some of them it is true, were occupied, as quarters, by the Spanish soldiery, which was also the case with the buildings contiguous to the Government House; but the troops stationed here, were properly appendages to the civil authority of the Governor, who was the military and political chief of the Province. Since the troops of the united states have been removed from Pensacola, no use, I believe, is made of any of these buildings; but left entirely unoccupied. Two of the block houses, which stand in the street, ought to be torn down, or removed; but in the present poverty of the city and county, may be used, for a time, as public offices. Excepting the jail, which is a miserable building, all these edifices are of wood, and very old.â€” Your letters of the 28"" August,â€ and of the 18"""" and 20** of September, with their several enclosures, addressed to Governor Duval, were received by me, on the 1* of this month. Upon the subject of Indian affairs, and particularly the treaty contemplated with those Tribes which reside in Florida, and to which your last communications relate, I have felt great solicitude, and exceedingly regret the absence of the Governor, of which, I presume, e'er this, you have been advised. I confess, that I do not see, in a manner satisfactory to my own mind, the relation in which the Secretary of the Territory stands to the Governor, as ex officio Superintendant of Indian affairs; neither do I understand clearly, the extent of my powers on this head, as acting Governor under the law of Congress. Notwithstanding this doubt, I should consider it my duty to act, if there were any thing which the public service required to be done, and which might be in my power to accomplish; but upon this subject, I am entirely without means or instructions.â€ It is unnecessary to state to you the situation of things in this section of Florida, in consequence of the dreadful pestilence which has prevailed in Pensacola. The sickness of my family, and of an esteemed friend (D"" Bronaugh) who was confined at my house, detained me a considerable time, in the city, after the Legislative Council adjourned to Emanuel's. As soon as it was in my power to leave Pensacola, I was compelled to provide a shelter for my family in the woods, to which their safety urged me to retire; and therefore, saw but little of Governor Duval, previous to his departure for the state of Kentucky. Having made no communications to me on the subject of the Indians, all the information I possess in relation to it, has been gathered from the documents and papers left in my charge by the Governor, upon his leaving the territory, and the communications from your Department by the last mail, the receipt of which has already been acknowledged.â€” From the Talk sent by the Governor, to the Indians of Florida, and communicated to your Department, it appears, that the 20"" of this month was appointed as the time of meeting at St Marks; and I understand from a letter, lately received from Richards the Interpreter, and addressed to Governor Duval, that the Chiefs and all their warriors will assemble on that day. I was, myself, under the impression, that it was intended the Chiefs alone should be invited; and such would also seem to have been the understanding of Col: Eustis, as expressed in his letter to the Governor, of the 15"" of September.â€ Upon referring, however, to the letter of Governor Duval to you, of the 22"" of September,â€ I understand that he has recommended, in the strongest terms, not to enter into any Treaty with the Indians this winter. This letter, connected with his departure for the state of Kentucky, without leaving me any instructions upon the contemplated negociation, induced me to believe, that the project, would, in all probability be abandoned, and in any event, that I should not be authorised to act, untill further advices were forwarded from the War Department.â€” It would appear, from your letter of the 28* of August,â€ received with your communications on the 1* Instant,â€ that it was desirable the Governor should meet the Indians at the time and place appointed, and negociate a treaty with them, if it suited his convenience to accept of this special appointment; and if not, intimating that Capt. Bell would probably be deputed on that duty. I am now at a loss to know, whether, in pursuance of the suggestion of Governor Duval, the Government has determined on holding no treaty, and if otherwise, whether Capt. Bell, or some other person has received instructions to proceed to St Marks, and accomplish the objects of the negociation. Unless a commissioner has been appointed, there will be no person authorized to meet the Indians in Council, and their assembling, must consequently, be productive of no valuable purpose. It was too late, even at the time of the Governor's departure from the Territory, to send word to the Indians, requesting them not to assemble, and giving the necessary explanations; and besides, I felt myself restrained from the adoption of this measure, by the letter of Governor Duval, of the 22* of September, in which he says:â€”â€œI shall, however, direct the Indians to be assembled according to your desire; but hope that no treaty will be held with them, until this subject is further investigated.â€ Even were it necessary for me to act on this occasion, and admitting it to be practicable from the situation of the country, I should be at a loss in making the preparations for supplying the Indians, or to know the nature and amount to be furnished at St Marks, as no funds have been placed at my disposal, and no instructions given me as a guide upon the subject Your letter of the 18"" of September,â€ states that all these preliminary arrangements had been entrusted to Col: Humphreys, under the direction of Governor Duval, and that you hoped he would arrive in due time.â€ I have to inform you, that he has not yet reached Pensacola, nor have I heard what progress he has made on his journey.â€” Another consideration which forbid my interference on this occasion, is, that on your receipt of the Governor's letter, informing your Department of his visit to Kentucky,â€ measures may have been concerted with Col: Humphreys and some other individual as Commissioner, on this subject, and perhaps any steps which might be taken by me would conflict with those adopted by the agents of the Government. By the next mail, I am in hopes to be advised of the determination of your Department, touching the suggestions of Governor Duval in his last communication.â€” Should I receive no further advices from the War Department upon this subject, and an agent should not be appointed to meet the Indians in Council, there does not appear to be any thing in my power, except despatching a messenger to St Marks, with letters to the Commandant of the place, informing him of the state of things which has unfortunately grown out of the circumstances already detailed. Without any authority to act as a Commissioner in holding a treaty with the Indians, myself, it would be useless for me to go to St Marks. In the absence of the Governor, my public duties forbid it. My want of funds, also renders it impossible for me to make any preparations for supplying the Indians, who will probably, assemble at St Marks in great numbers. They will, no doubt, be greatly disappointed, and it is to be feared, much dissatisfied. How far it may have an effect in exciting a spirit of hostility, or interfer with any future effort at negociation, I cannot certainly anticipate. Upon an explanation to the Chiefs and Warriors, it is to be hoped that any difficulty will be obviated.â€â€” Accept Sir, the assurance of my high Consideration &câ€” GEO.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, x:ALS*",Correspondence,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR; The dreadful calamity which visited Pensacola, this season, of which you have, no doubt, long since been advised, it will be readily imagined, has thrown great difficulties in the way of public business of every description. Every one who could leave the city, fled from the deadly pestilence; and in consequence of the small number of settlements in the country contiguous, many were obliged to live in huts and tents through the woods, as the only means of safety. The sickness of my own family detained me for a considerable time in Town; and I was one of the last of the Americans to make my escape. Under such circumstances of distress and derangement, it has not been in my power to devote that strict attention, which I could have desired, in discharging those duties in relation to the Government of the Territory, that have devolved on me, in consequence of the departure of the Governor for the state of Kentucky. With regard to the publication of the laws, I regret to state, that it has been delayed very much against my wish; but from the situation of this section of the country, it was not possible to have the printing executed at Pensacola, and from the prevalence of Yellow fever at New Orleans, very little better prospect was presented in that quarter. The desease having greatly subsided at this place, I am at this time, under the expectation, that a contract will be entered into with the printer of Pensacola, so as to have the work completed by the 10"" of January. The duty of contracting for, and superintending the printing of the laws, was imposed by an act of the Legislative Council, upon two of its own members, who it is understood, are engaged in making the necessary arrangements. Should they not be enabled to make a contract, so as to have the work completed at the time proposed, I shall take upon myself the responsibility of despatching a messenger to New Orleans, on this special commission, in order to be enabled, in time, to present to Congress a printed copy of the acts of the Legislative Council of this Territory. Owing to the great variety of subjects, on which it became necessary to legislate, the volume will consist of 3 or 400 octavo pages, and it is expected that the expence of printing will be considerable. In the event of failure to have the laws printed, as was contemplated, I shall proceed, without delay to have them copied, and confidently calculate upon being enabled to have them transmited to you by 1"" of February. I am now engaged in examining the copy made out by the directions of the Governor, and shall be prepared to deliver it to the printer, as soon as arrangements are made to progress with the work. In the performance of my labours, it will be indispensibly necessary that I should have the assistance of a clerk. The additional duties imposed upon me, by the absence of the Governor, renders it almost impracticable for me to get on without such aid; but how he is to be compensated for his services, I am at a loss to determine, as it appears there is no provision made to meet the case in the act of Congress, organizing the Government of Florida. As soon as your convenience will permit, you will confer a favor by advising me upon this subject, as it is one upon which I feel considerable solicitude. Amongst the papers and documents left in my charge by Governor Duval, was a bill, drawn by him on your Department, for the sum of 301867â€“57â€“37 3300 dollars, which, by his letter of advice, is to be appropriated in defraying the expences incured by the Legislative Council, and those incident to the publication of the Laws. This draft I have negociated with the House of F. H. Nisbet & Co *â€”and am, from time to time, applying the proceeds to the purposes for which it was intended.â€” The public buildings have not yet been turned over to me by Col: Clinch. A correspondence has taken place between us,â€ which I presume has been communicated by the Colonel to the Secretary at War, to whom I have written fully on the subject.â€ There was some difficulty in deciding what buildings were to be surrendered to the Executive of the Territory, and which retained, as being of a description purely military. I believe however, they will all be delivered over, agreeably to the request in my last letter to Col: Clinch, subject to the decision of the Secretary of War. For my own part, I do not think there ought to be any difficulty on this occasion; the block houses standing on the public square, are the only buildings which possess any thing of a military character, and that alone, on account of their structure and original use. Several letters have been received from the Secretary at War, in relation to our intercourse, and a contemplated treaty with the Indians of Florida. These I have answered, to which I beg leave to refer you. It will be seen, that some embarrassment and confusion have arisen upon the subject, which, to me, has been a source of no ordinary share of anxiety. I was extremely solicitous to do any thing within the compass of my power; but under the circumstances, I was altogether at a loss to determine what duties had devolved on me by the absence of the Governor, as superintendant of Indian affairs, or from the papers in my possession, to ascertain what measures could be adopted. This, I have more fully and explicitly explained in my communication to the Secretary at War. I regret extremely, that Governor Duval should have found it absolutely necessary to be absent from the Territory at this particular juncture. During the prevalence of the fever, domestic duties of the most imperative and irresistable character, precluded me an opportunity of having scarcely any conversation with him, relative to Indian affairs; and almost all the information which I possess upon the subject, is derived from the correspondence between the Governor and the War Department, entrusted to my charge, upon his departure for the State of Kentucky; and from communications received from Mr Calhoun by the last mail.â€â€” I have the honor to be with sentiments of the highest respect yr obt Servant GEO WALTON Sec'y & Act Gov: of the Terry of Florida THE HON: JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Secretary of State.

BARBOUR,"THE HONâ€ THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES of U. States: SIR: The act of Congress, passed at the last session, for organizing a Board of Commissioners to ascertain claims and titles to land within the Territories of Florida,â€ requires, that our session should terminate at Pensacola, and commence at St. Augustine, by the first of January next. We have the honor to inform you, and through you, the honorable body over which you preside, that it will be altogether imprac- ticable to bring our duties to a close in West Florida, within the time prescribed. In consequence of the fatality with which the yellow fever prevailed at Pensacola, the prosecution of our commission has been unavoidably suspended for more than three months. Such was its malignancy, that scarcely an American escaped who remained within the reach of contagion. Every description of business was, at length, almost entirely abandoned, and all who possessed the means, betook themselves to flight, as the only measure of safety. Under such circumstances, had we disregarded our own safety, such was the distress of the inhabitants, that the claimants could not have attended to the presentment of their titles. There are yet reported to be a few cases of yellow fever in Pensacola, which combined with the fact, that the weather continues warm and without frost, renders it doubtful whether we could return with impunity. As soon as we can obtain assurances to this effect, which are daily expected, our duties will be promptly resumed. We feel evry anxiety to progress, and to accomplish as soon as possible, the objects of our appointment.â€” Under these circumstances, we would respectfully recommend, an extension of the sessions, both at Pensacola and St. Augustine. It will certainly require more time to complete the investigation of land claims in Florida, than at first anticipated. We would suggest an additional term of six months, for West Florida, with the power of adjourning should the business be sooner completed; as also such prolongation in that at St. Augustine, as the Delegate may deem necessary. He is no doubt, well informed upon the subject, and can give to Congress evry information which is desirable.â€” Feeling the necessity of such a prolongation, and trusting that your honorable body will not hesitate to pass an act * authorizing the same, we shall continue to prosecute our duties at this place, until we hear what disposition Congress has made upon the subject. We would add, that the difficulty of transportation from this to St. Augustine, renders it desirable that the business should be completed here in one session. This was, no doubt, the intention of the law, by which this board was organized. Againâ€”the Commissioners, to prevent fraud, have resolved, that claims must be presented in the Province where the grant was made.

"NA;HF, 17 Cong, 2 sess.:DS""",Memorial,MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF EAST FLORIDA,,,"To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled The Memorial of the Subscribers, inhabitants of East Florida, respectfully represents: That from the great extent of this Territory, and the distance and difficulty of communication between its Western and Eastern extremity, much inconvenience has been experienced by the union of the two Sections of the Territory under one local government. Great delays and impediments have been experienced in the meeting of the Territorial Legislature, the promulgation of the laws, regulations for elections and returns, and other important communications, connected with the Public welfare. The Spanish Government, aware of the inconvenience which would result from the two Floridas being placed under one Government found it necessary to constitute two seperate and distinct administrations in the Country. Your memorialists, therefore, pray, that in East Florida a Government may be formed Seperate from and independent of West Florida, until the population of both Sections united, may be adequate to the formation of a State. Your memorialists are persuaded that such a measure would be highly beneficial to the welfare and prosperity of the whole Territory Your Memorialists further beg leave to represent, that although the cultivation of the sugar cane and other valuable productions of this country, afford a great and unprecedented inducement to the Settlement of planters in this Territory; yet the Situation of public affairs in the Territory has hitherto greatly discouraged settlers from coming in and forming establishments. One great obstacle to the settlement and improvement of the Country is the uncertainty which exists in regard to the titles to land, particularly on account of the claims of the United States. The delay which has taken place in adjusting and determining these Claims has been one of the most serious evils which this Country has experienced since the change of Government. By this means the population of the Country has been greatly retarded, persons desirous of forming settlements here, have been unwilling to make purchases of lands, under the embarrassed and uncertain claims of individuals and of the Government: and consequently, the property of individuals as well as that of the Government of the United States is experiencing a depreciation in value. Your Memorialists therefore pray that an Act be passed authorizing the immediate appointment of distinct and seperate land commissioners for this Section of the Territory, to adjust and determine the claims of the Government of the United States, and to continue their sittings until all the Claims be disposed of.â€ And Your Memorialists respectfully Submit, whether the expense attending the exhibition and proof of titles before such Commissioners ought not to be borne by the Government of the United States, rather than by the individuals, who are called upon to produce the same, in as much as the exhibition of documents, in these cases, are made at the call of the United States, and for their benefit Your memorialists further pray, that as it will take some time before the Land Commissioners will be able to adjust and determine all the claims to land in this Territory, that an Act of Congress be passed authorizing Citizens of the United States to settle upon the public lands, known as such, and where no individual claims are in opposition, giving public notice of the location, where the settlement is intended to be made, with permission to remain on the Same, paying to the United States the value which may hereafter be determined upon, in regulating the prices of the public lands in this Territory; and whatever improvements shall be made shall be for the benefit of the United States, should payment not be made accordingly * Your memorialists further respectfully represent, that another cause of the Slow population of this Territory, and of which the inhabitants have much reason to complain, is the condition of the public roads. It is a fact, that between this Territory and the State of Georgia, there is no land communication required by the ordinary intercourse between one State and Another. Your Memorialists therefore, submit this fact to the Consideration of Congress, in the confident hope that Some provision will be made for the opening and construction of roads and bridges Your memorialists further beg leave to Suggest, as a means of promoting the welfare and prosperity of this Territory and of the United States, that a Light-house be erected at the entrance of the harbour of S*Augustine, at S*John's River, Mosquito, and Key West,â€ and a beacon at the South end of Lake George Your memorialists farther represent, that another and a very serious cause, impeding the population of this Territory, is the situation of affairs in regard to the Seminole Indiansâ€”a race of people whose habits and occupations are at variance with those of the other inhabitants of this Territory and with whom the mutual relations are not known or understoodâ€”Your Memorialists therefore pray that such convention, treaty, or arrangements may be made with these Indians, as may be deemed fit and expedient, to ensure the tranquillity and security of this country Your memorialists further beg leave to State, that among the obstacles to the settlement of this Territory, may be reckoned the opinion entertained by many British Emigrants of the validity of their claims, under grants from the British Government, although those claims were proscribed by a Royal order of the Spanish Government soon after the cession of this Country to Spain by the British Government; and those claims became absolutely extinct on the 2"" day of October 1790 58 Your memorialists beg leave further to represent, that in their opinion the public welfare would be promoted by a general election of the members of the Legislative Council. Your memorialists further respectfully represent, that they consider the Act of the Legislative Council of this Territory, passed at the late session in Pensacola providing for the levying of Taxes, as very objectionable, in as much as the taxes contemplated to be raised by that act, would, according to the best calculations, exceed the amount of the whole exports of the domestic produce of the Territory. A great proportion of these taxes are intended to be levied on lands, which are unimproved and unproductive, for the causes before mentioned, and these taxes necessarily have a tendency to discourage settlers. Your Memorialists therefore pray that an Act of Congress may be passed, Suspending the Collection of these taxes, until the next meeting of the Legislative Council of this Territory. Another Act of the Legislative Council passed at their late session, entitled â€œAn Act providing for the election of a Delegate to Congressâ€ Your memorialists also consider as liable to very serious objection, because, by one of the provisions of that Act, the common Soldiers who may be in the Territory, without possessing the usual qualifications of voters, may exercise the right of suffrage, and by that means, forming a body which would in all probability be under the complete control of the officers, might, in defiance of the will of the other inhabitants of the Territory, at all times, decide the election. Your memorialists therefore pray that this evil may be remedied by an Act of Congress.â€ Your memorialists beg leave to represent that the establishment of Inferior Courts of Justice in this Territory, except those of Justices of the Peace, is attended with much expense; and, until the population of the Country considerably increase, might be rendered unnecessary, so far as regards the trial of civil and criminal causes, if Congress would extend the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to all cases where the Sum or value in controversy Should amount to fifty Dollars, giving that Court also appellate jurisdiction, by appeal, certiorari, and writ of error, from the decisions of the Justices of the Peace in all cases:â€” and it would be greatly conducive to the ends of public justice, if an appeal could be granted from the judgment of the Superior Court, in all cases where the Sum or value, in controversy should amount to $2,000 as in cases from the circuit courts of the United States under the Judiciary Act of 24"" September 1789 ""â€“ By Order & on behalf of a Public Meeting of the Inhabitants of East Florida held in the City of St Augustine the 29"" day of November 1822 WATERS SMITH Chairman Attest F: J: FATIO.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS",Correspondence,JOHN RODMAN TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,JOHN RODMAN,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR. I take the liberty to inform you, that there are, under my charge, in the public store attached to the Custom House, eight large boxes of papers, which were taken, by direction of Mr Worthington, while acting here as Governor, from the house of the late Spanish Governor Coppinger. Many of these papers, it is believed, are of great importance in regard to the titles to land in this Territory. The royal orders, upon which many grants of land were made, are said to be in some of the boxes: but were not found, on a very cursorary examination, which was made by the Commissioners appointed by Mr Worthington to look over the papers. Mr Reynolds, who has lately been appointed by Governor Duval to be keeper of the public archives * in this place, and who arrived here a few days ago, informs me, that he does not consider his Commission as extending to the charge of these documents. Under these circumstances and believing that a minute examination of these papers will throw much light on the subject of many of the grants of land in this Territory, I take the liberty, with great respect, of suggesting the propriety of authorizing Mr Reynolds (who from his knowledge of the Spanish language is well qualified for the business), to take charge of, examine, and make out an Inventory of all these documents, that persons whose interests may be involved in their authenticity may at any time have recourse to them. I think it would be very useful to join with Mr Reynolds, or any other person who may be appointed to examine these papers, Mr Antonio Alvarez, who was for some time the Secretary of Governor Coppinger, and who is a gentleman of much respectability resident here, being now the President of the Board of Alderman of this City.â€ With great respect I have the honour, to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant JOHN RODMAN Collector of St. Augustine THE HON.

SIR: I have the honor to advise you of my return to this city, from St. Marks, last evening, after an absence of fifteen days. I was prepared to sail on the 18"" Nov with the provisions, &c. for the Indians, ordered by Gov"" Duval to assemble at St. Marks on the 20"" of that month. A severe storm, however, prevented the vessel from leaving the port before the 21"" On the 27"" we reached St. Marks; where I learned, three of the chiefs had promptly obeyed the order of the Gov"" by attending at the time appointed. Not finding the Gov' or agent, they returned to their towns on the 23* I could then only assemble some of the neghboring chiefs, (among them Eneamathla,"" the principal of his nation) and deliver to them the talk with which you entrusted me; together with such other explanations, as were necessary to convince them, that there was no disposition on the part of the Government, or of Gov"" Duval, to neglect, disappoint, or trifle with them. Blount, Yellow Hair, and Turke-hayo, the chiefs who were at St. Marks on the 20"" appeared, (as I was advised by the officers of the garrison) somewhat disposed to distrust the sincerity of the Government, on not finding the Gov"" or agent, at the time and place appointed to hold the talk. Capt. Morris, commandant of the Fort, dispatched an Indian runner to Eneamathla and other chiefs, on the day of my arrival, with instructions to meet me the next day, (28 Nov.) which were promptly attended to. In the course of the day, Eneamathla, Olochtamica, Chificknico Hadjo, chief of Ocilleys,â€ Forhachtimico, Leghlaficksico, and Hopoi Tuskamicksy arrived; to whom I explained the causes of the Gov' or agent failing to meet at St. Marks, on the day appointed; and delivered to them your talk, through the Interpreter Hardridge,â€ with which they were well satisfied, notwithstanding the great anxiety expressed to know the exact situation in which they stand with the Government of the United States. The principal chief, Eneamathla, assured me, that he, his chiefs and warriors, would remain peaceable and contented, until an authorized agent should arrive, for the purpose of establishing a definite and durable understanding between them and the government. The provisions intended for the Indians (expected to assemble at St. Marks,) I turned over to Lt. Hutter, acting asst. Comâ€ of Subsistence, for the use of the troops or Indians, as the case might be; (they were then in want of them). the receipt of Lieut. Hutter, I send you herewith. Although these provisions were not made use of as intended, I am convinced they served to satisfy the chiefs whom I met, and through them the whole nation, that the Gov"" was well disposed towards them; and would take such measures, as would ultimately secure to them their rights. And again,-the circumstance of their knowing the fact, that provisions were depositted at St. Marks, originally intended for their use, and now subject to their wants, under the particular directions and limits of the Secr'y of War, will have a strong tendency to make them remain peaceable and well disposed; particularly as their crops were extremely scant the last summer, and many of them they say, will suffer with hunger without aid from the Government.â€” I feel fully authorized in assuring you, that no apprehension should be entertained of the friendly disposition of these Indians. They have no inclination to commence hostilities with the whites, or among themselves, as has been intimated to you. There is some considerable anxiety felt and expressed by the Whites, who have settled on lands 79 Presumably the Seminoles from Ocilla, a town on the east bank of the river of the same name in Taylor County. 30 James Hardridge. comprehended in what is termed Forbes' grant, as to the probable result of the contemplated treaty with the Seminole Indians. The understanding from the officers of the Fort and some citizens resident on the Apalatchicola, that a M. Richards, an Indian Interpreter, appointed by Gov"" Duval, had, for some time past, been intriguing with Eneamathla and other chiefs, and exciting them to assert and maintain their right to the lands they now occupy, in order that he may obtain from them a tract of six miles square, which he says, they have promised him. I deemed it proper, under these circumstances, to say nothing to the chiefs on the subject; more particularly, as I had recd no instructions from you to do so.â€” It is not necessary for me to go into a detail of the malconduct of this Richards; as Capt. Morris and M. Doyle, the latter a prisoner at the instance of Richards, both now in the city, will give you a full and candid statement. I would, however recommend, that he should not only be deprived of his present appointment, but be driven from the country; as I am fully convinced of his villainy, and disposition to excite jealousy and hatred in the Indians towards the honest white population, as well as the government of the United States.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS",Correspondence,ALEXANDER HAMILTON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,ALEXANDER HAMILTON,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR. I have found upon an examination of the correspondence from the Commissioners appointed under â€œAn act for ascertaining claims and Titles to Lands within the Territory of Floridaâ€ that they consider it impossible, to transact the business entrusted to them, within the time prescribed, and invite the attention of Congress, to the necessity of passing a supplemental act, to extend their session.â€ The malignant fever, which unhappily desolated Pensacola, is represented as the principal cause of interruption to the progress of their examinations. If in the slightest degree, the Grants in West Florida, partake of the exceptionable character of those in the East, it would be peculiarly injudicious to precipitate the Commissioners in the termination of their labours. When Congress legislated upon this subject they were possibly not aware of the numerous and extensive concessions made by the Governors of Florida and especially since the year 1815 and immediately anticedent to January 1818â€“ It is understood, that in East Florida, there are no less than twelve hundred Spanish and it is believed the British will not fall short of five hundredâ€” The peculiar munificence of the Grants said to be made by Governor White,â€ will require the most scrupulous investigation; the general reputation of that Gentleman being in direct hostility to any semblance of prodigality. The Royal order of 1815, confirmatory or perhaps more correctly, prospectively approbatory of the remunerative donations of Governor Kindeland,â€ to those who had shown their loyalty in the revolution of 1812 has been the foundation of the most preposterous extravagance by Governor Coppinger. Many individuals are the subjects of repeated Royal Bounty and in several instances, upon a remuneration of services, the pretexts of anticedent donations. With these circumstances, certain to involve a mature investigation in difficulty and embarrassment, added to the alleged necessity of prolonging the Board of Commissioners in West Florida, it would be adviseable to create a new Board for similar purposes in East Florida. The inducements for such an arrangement must appear evident, whether the immediate interests of individuals or the public be consideredâ€”on the score of economy the advantage to the nation although inconsiderate nevertheless preponderates. To private claim- ants it will be but justice and absolutely important, for embarrassed as their property now is, every moment of procrastination, is to them a source of positive sacrifice. Those whose claims will most probably be confirmed cannot sell and dare not cultivate; while on the contrary those concessions, the magnitude of which, have naturally excited the jealousy of Congress, are constantly gaining consequence, as they become every day more the subjects of speculation to men of wealth, reputation and influence and whativer may be the result of their expectations, they will introduce settlers, hereafter to become pertinacious petititioners to the liberality and munificence of Government. The capability of this Country to produce the most valuable subjects of Culture, the sugar cane, the best sea Island Cotton, the Cuba Tobacco and all the tropical fruits, including the olive, with Oranges Limes and Lemons in great abundance and of superior quality calls for the most efficient and fostering attention. The salubrity of the climate is unquestionable, notwithstanding the extraordinary malady in Pensacola this year and in S*Augustine the last, in each of which places, the first appearance of the Fiver was preceded by a peculiarity of circumstances, at all times to be guarded againstâ€” If, as it appears probable, from the statement of the Commissioners Mess. Ware and Overton, that their session will be extended, until the coming winter, and, as a period, equal to that, which will be necessary in West Florida, will be requisite in East Florida, two years will be the time to which the continuance of the present Board must be extended, provided the whole business be confided to them, at an expense of twelve thousand dollars; consequently if an additional Board be established and the same business can be done in half the time which will be consumed by the one, the charge upon the Government will be the same, while the public lands will be more speedily ascertained. - - - The requisites of the present law operate with unexpected hardship upon the heirs and representatives of such persons who have held their lands by descent for centuries, particularly in the Cities where the public property has been designated with scrupulous accuracy in the official shedules and while the public can anticipate no advantage, individuals are to be put to great expense and exposed in the â€œderaignmentâ€ of their titles, to much subsequent vexatious litigationâ€” In most instances lands granted for Head Rights in conformity to the Royal order of 1791 exceed the number of acres to which the confirmatory powers of the Commissioners extend and as these grants are esteemed, as having been made in good faith it would be an equitable indulgence to individuals to have the powers of the Commissioners enlargedâ€” The Church of St Augustine built by, private and public contributions, has been transferred to the United States as public property,  there never having been any grant or concession of it to the inhabitants, by the King or his authorized Agentsâ€”I have understood, that all the correspondence in relation to this subject between Governor Qusada"" and the Court of Spain is to be found in the twelve Boxes of papers claimed to be public and as belonging to the King of Spain by Governor Coppingerâ€”The building of the Church was certainly commenced by private contributions and finally completed by donations from the Kingâ€”with the facts, the interference of Congress will be necessary, to confirm the right of the Church, to the Roman Catholic inhabitants of St Augustine.â€ If Congress exempt antient grantees from the necessity of exhibiting, their titles, they can authorise the Commissioners in all suspicious circumstances to call for an exhibition *â€” I have the honor to be with great respect your Obt H Sert ALEXANDER HAMILTON TO JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Esq Sec of State.

I have the honor, herewith, to enclose you a correspondence, between Lieut Col. Eustis commanding at this Post, and Waters Smith Esqr Mayor, of the City, relative to some property belonging to the United States. I am also directed by Lieut. Col. Eustis to give you a statement of facts concerning this property. In the distribution of the public property in this city, between the civil & military authorities, after specifying some particular lots that should belong to the civil, and some, to the military departments, the President of the United States, directed that â€œall other public property should be in charge of the military department.â€”The civil authorities have, long since, been formally put in possession of those lots & buildings which were assigned to them;-but, not content with this, and regardless of the orders of the President, the municipal authorities, have wrested from the hands of the military, a portion of the property committed to their charge;â€”during the absence of Col Eustis and entirely without my knowledge, they possessed themselves of the house and lot, known by the name of the â€œDragoon Barracks,â€ rased the building to the ground, and disposed of the materials for the benefit of the city. They have, also, publickly offered to rent a tenement known as the â€œSmithyâ€ which is now, and always has been in the actual occupancy of the military. These two buildings were both turned over by the Spanish authorities to the U.S. and by what title or upon what plea, the city claims them I am unable to say. The Mayor in his letter (B) states that these two buildings are entirely detached from the fort or barracks;â€“the former is so, but the latter almost immediately adjoins the fort, their being only a small smithy between them, erected and claimed by the late Spanish Royal Armourer,-I know not by what right or tittle. There are three small tenements on the eastern extremity of the public square, that have always paid, to the Spanish Government a ground rent;â€”since they have been in possession of the United States, I have exacted & received, a similar rent.â€”I am unofficially informed that the corporation has forbidden the occupants, to make any further payment to the U. S. and that they intend to prosecute me for the rent, which I have already received. It is entirely impossible, that the corporation was not aware that the above property was in charge of the military authorities, as, I, myself, informed the mayor of it. The claims of the city authorities are so undefined, that I do not know, where they will cease, but, they appear disposed to extend them to all the property within the bounds of the city, for they already talk, of having the Fort for a penitentiary, the magazine for a Gaol, and the S* Francis Barracks for a college.â€ I have the honor to be Sir Your Most.

I have been unofficially advised, that the Corporation of the City of St. Augustine, has taken possession of a portion of the publick property of the U.S. committed to my charge by the President;-has caused the building known by name of the â€œdragoon Barracksâ€ to be pulled down, & the materials to be disposed of, & has offered to rent the building known as the â€œSmithyâ€ now in the actual occupation of the military. Entertaining a full respect for the authorities of the city, I take the liberty to solicit of you official information on this subject, and to enquire on what ground the corporation of the City claims the right, of disposing of property of the U.S. which has been positively placed, by the order of the President in charge of the military. I have the honor to enclose a copy of my instructions in relation to this property and am With high respect &"" &"" AB"" EUSTIS WATERS SMITH Esqr. Mayor of St. Augustine Waters Smith to Abraham Eustis (Copy) CITY OF STAUGUSTINE 26th December 1822 DEAR SIR, In reply to your letter of the 11* instant. I have the honor to State, that the property to which your enquiries have reference, is Considered in the legal possession of the Corporation of this City and subject to its Controul and disposition on the ground of ownership. A special detail of title will not now be deemed necessary; It is sufficient to remark, that by the laws of Spain applicable to this Country, in relation to the laying out and establishment of Towns; upon principles which apply to the City in its Corporate Character, and from the public Archives, facts and usages which relate to it, the Corporation views its title as most satisfactory and valid. It is due Sir, to the authorities of the City, that I should observe, that in the Course taken in respect to this property, they have not been actuated by the most distant intention of infringing on Military right; Their interest and feelings would lead them, equally to avoid collisions, and to cultivate the most harmonious understanding with the military functionaries stationed at St Augustine. It was not to be supposed that an unoccupied and uninclosed lot near the Centre of the Town and the building upon it termed in your letter the â€œDragoon Barrack,â€ in a state of such dilapidation as to Cause it to be deemed a nuisance; or that the dwelling house, â€œknown as the Smithyâ€ tenanted by a single family, situated in a populous part of the City, and like the Dragoon intirely seperate and distinct from the fort and the Barracks occupied by the Troops under your Command, should have been Considered by the Corporation of S*Augustine as Committed to â€œMilitary charge by the President of the United Statesâ€ As little did it seem from facts known, that the Corporate authorities, even on principles of Courtesy, were called upon to communicate with the military Commandant, before the Steps mentioned in your letter where taken by them. Their way appeared clear; the property belonged to the City, and they were not aware of any existing Military claim. In addition to these considerations, if any thing more were necessary, they acted under the authority of the Governor of the Territory. It cannot Sir, be admitted by me as Mayor of this City, nor will the Constituded authorities thereof be induced to believe, that on the exchange of Goverments because the property in question, like the public square the Cathedral and City market house, fell under military Controul, that the City is thereby divested of its title or, that such property legally Continued subject to martial rule, after the establishment here of distinct Civil powers: I must add also, in relation to the order from the War Department, (a copy of which you have been good enough to furnish me) that while I express the utmost deference and respect for the official station of the Secretary of War: I cannot for a moment subscribe to the assumption, that he is authorized to dispose of the rights of this city; to distribute or Controul its property. or to direct it to remain in Charge of the military or of any other Authority. Our Government Sir, is a Government of Laws, not of persons. By your letter however, and by the above order I am informed, that by direction from the President of the United States Communicated through the Secretary of War you stand charged with this property. In our personal Interviews Prior and subject to the letter I understood you to say, that you were willing and desirous to be released by the War department from this charge and that the possession of the Property was not necessary to the accomodation of your troops. In this view of the Subject and after what I have written in reply to your enquiries; asserting the rights of the City, I cannot but consider it proper and adviseable for me as Mayor thereof, in order that hereafter there may be no misapprehension or Collision on this Subject between the Military and City authorities to request of you; which I do respectfully and formally, to make application to the Department of War, for further instructions in relation to this property, and for authority hence forward to Consider yourself discharged from the possession and Controul of all Buildings, lots and property belonging to this City. I have the honor to be Sir, with great respect and most sincere personal regard Your Obdt Servt (Signed) WATERS SMITH Mayor of the City of St Augustine. LIEUT COLABR"" EUSTIS Coms U. S.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday in reply to mine of the 11"" inst. I had hoped to receive a more categorical answer, to the question I had proposed.â€”I neither expected, nor wished so elaborate a replication to a note which I addressed to you in all possible frankness, and which remained fifteen days unanswered,â€”I must not, & will not be drawn into a discussion of claims to property.â€”I profess a full respect for the constituted authorities of the City, and flatter myself, that I have as much at heart its permanent interests and future prosperity, as any one residing within its limits;-But I am here officially charged by the government of the U.S. with the care of certain buildings lots &Â° turned over to them, by the late Spanish authorities, as belonging to the sovereignty; and it is not for me to decide whether or not this was done with propriety. The Corporation of the City has thought proper to wrest a portion of this property from my possession;â€”I have not offered, nor do I intend to offer, the slightest resistance to this procedure; All that I have now to do, is to submit this correspondence, with the facts in relation to it, to the Department of war, and I entertain no doubt that I shall, in consequence, receive further instructions, in relation to this property. I beg you to accept both personally & officially, the assurance of my esteem & respect. ABm EUSTIS Lt. COll WATERs SMITH Esq. Mayor &""",1822,December,30,1822-12-30,ST. AUGUSTINE,1750,1822.1230

Of this sum I have not recieved any advices, and have presumed it never was forwarded. Richards being a poor man in want of money, and having advanced the funds necessary to defray the expences of himself and the Indians in coming to Pensacola, I felt myself authorized under the authority of your letter, to pay him three hundred dollars, in part satisfaction for his services, and to appropriate the ballance to the liquidation of Capt Morris's accounts and the expences of the Indians and Interpreter whilst at this place and returning home. Alltogether, these payments have not exceeded the five hundred dollars which it is to be supposed, were intended to be applied to these objectsâ€” Being entirely without money belonging to the Indian department, at the time these accounts were presented, they were met by arrangements which I hope will meet your approbation. The accounts of Capt Morris were paid out of other public funds in my hands, and for the purpose of replacing this amount, and covering the sums paid Richards for his services, and the expences incident to the visit of the Indians and their return home, I was under the necessity of drawing a draft on your Department, in favor of F.

"NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., W 229:LS",Correspondence,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON TO GAD HUMPHREYS,ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON,GAD HUMPHREYS,"COL. GAD. HUMPHREYS, Indian Agent. SIR. In a letter from the War Department, dated on the 19"" of August last, the Governor of this Territory was, advised that you had been directed to repair to Florida, and report yourself to him for such instructions as he might deem necessary to insure a just and faithful discharge of the various duties which will arise in your intercourse with the Indians.â€ In the absence of the Governor, who is, ex officio. Superintendent of Indian Affairs, the performance of this duty has devolved upon me, which I shall now proceed to discharge as far as I am enabled from the information in my possession. I regret, on this occasion, the absence of the Governor, whose opportunities, for private conference with the Secretary of War upon the subject, and whose experience in Indian Affairs whilst here, would have enabled him to supply any deficiencies which may well be supposed to arise, in consequence of my information having been gleaned from correspondence which remains in my office, and, one or two conversations with Indian Chiefs.â€”I have every confidence, however, that these deficiencies will be supplied by a sound discretion on your part, and that you will, in all cases, exercise it to the intire satisfaction of the superintendent, and of the Government.â€” Until Congress, by treaty or otherwise, shall have settled the future location of the Florida Indians, it is impracticable to designate any place for your permanent residence.â€ For the present, considering the mutual convenience of the Indians and Agent, it is believed that St. Marks combines the most advantages. You will, therefore, as soon as convenient, repair to that post; and when you shall have become settled, and Sufficiently acquainted with the Indians, their views and wishes, you will, from time to time, report to the superintendent every thing you may conceive interesting in regard to those tribes. In discharging this branch of your duty, you are desired to communicate your opinions as to the best means of introducing amongst the Indians, the habits and employments of civilized life and of instructing them in the improved processes of Agriculture, which have been adopted by our own countrymen. You are also required to use your best exertions, within the pale of your authority, to prevent animosity and dissention amongst themselves, and to suppress apprehensions of severity or injustice from our Government, and of violence from the Creek Indians. By these means you may be very instrumental in preserving peace, and a spirit of conciliation between them and the United States, and afford to the Government suggestions important to the welfare of those tribes, and to the cause of humanity. It will be necessary, in your intercource with the Indians, to employ one or more Interpreters, who will reside at such place, or places as you shall designate, and recieve such compensation as you may contract to give, not exceeding one dollar per day. In making a selection, it is particularly recommended, that the individual who is to perform this duty, shall be of good moral character, and otherwise entitled to the most implicit confidence. Until this is satisfactorily ascertained, it would not, it is concieved, be advisable to make the appointment for any definite time. As some dificulties have arisen between M* Richards, the present Interpreter, and E. P. Doyle, it will be your duty to make yourself acquainted with the facts in relation to it; and if, at any time, you shall be satisfied that M. Richards is not qualified for his station, upon application, to the Superintendant another will be appointed. With regard to M.â€ Doyle, should you discover that his deportment is such as will authorize you to remove from the nation in which he resides, you will do so as promptly as possibleâ€” Capt. Pelham, late of the army of the United States, has been appointed Sub-Agent,â€ and is subject to your controul. He is required to make his reports and communications thro' you to the Superintendant, unless when attended with inconvenience or delay; and will be paid by you quarterly or by the Superintendant if more convenient. Capt. Pelham is understood to be absent, at present, by permission of the Secretary of War, in consequence of bad health.â€â€” When remittances are recieved, funds will be placed in your hands, to be appropriated in paying the Sub Agent, for presents to the Indians, and for contingencies, At the close of each quarter, it is made your duty to render to the Superintendant your account with vouchers for all disbursements, which must be accompanied by a general abstract of disbursements within the quarter; detailing under distinct heads the various objects of disbursements, as pay of subAgent, Interpreters, presents, rations, &c, &c, so as to leave as few as possible to be embraced under the head of contingencies. You will also add a statement shewing the names of all persons employed by you as Interpreters, and in every other capacity, together with the amount of wages paid them respectively.â€” You will have observed from the tenor of the Act of Congress, and the Instructions to the Superintendant submitted to your inspection, that the most rigid economy is required in all disbursements, and the strictest exactitude in rendering accounts. It is necessary that the accounts of the Agent should be forwarded to the Superintendant at an early period; particularly that of the quarter ending on the 30"" September to enable the latter to make out a statement of his accounts. which are to be deposited in the post office on that day.â€”As Agent you have authority to grant temporary licences to trade with the Indians, which should be exercised with the greatest caution, in strict conformity with the act of Congress, and with every possible care to prevent fraud, or the introduction of ardent Spirits amongst them. You will keep copies of all the licences, and regularly return them with the Securities, to the Superintendant.â€” In calling your attention to these particulars, with a refference to the acts of Congress, which more minutely explain your several duties, accompanied by the enclosed forms of an abstract of expenditures, and a Quarterly Estimate, I believe I have furnished you with every necessary instruction, at present in my power; but if any thing material has been omitted any future application for further information connected with this subject will be attended to promptly and with pleasure.""â€” I have the honor to be, Yr.

Capt Burch appears to have a personal knowledge of the Country only from Pensacola to the Suwanee and estimates the whole distance to St. Augustine at 462 miles. From information in my possession there is very little doubt but that this calculation may be reduced by crossing the bay immediately at Pensacola and pursuing a direct course so as to intersect the old Spanish road not far from the Mikasuky towns. The only object in taking the circuitous direction of Fort Crawford * is to avoid the Bay and the swamp of its tributary streams; and this difficulty may be obviated by adopting the measure above suggested. Should the government however determine to open the road I would respectfully recommend that before it is commenced one or more suitable persons who are well acquainted with the Country & its localities be selected to make such an examination as may be necessary to obtain a correct report relative to the most advisable route. It is very desirable that the road should be opened and it ought to be done with a care & economy calculated to render it a permanent establishment. The union harmony and intercourse of East & West Florida would be sensibly promoted by the accomplishment of such an important undertaking; it would greatly contribute to the wealth & population of the intervening territory and by the enhanced value of the publick lands save to the government more than it will have expended. The calculation of the cost as represented by Capt Burch is a liberal one and if opened in a direct route and upon the most suitable ground I have no doubt that such a road as is contemplated by the Quarter Master when finished will fall short of the expense as stated in his estimateâ€” Col. Humphreys the Indian Agent embarked from Pensacola on the 27"" instant for St. Marks, Upon his reporting himself at this place for instructions they were made out & presented to him as directed by your several communications to the Governor of Florida. In framing them I availed myself of the best information in my reach & hope every thing was communicated to Col. Humphreys upon the subject of his duties which was necessary as a guide in their execution. A copy of them is enclosed *â€” You will also receive herewith an account and receipt of Maj. Thomas Wright of the army of the United States for services therein specified.â€ Although I had no publick funds in my hands, I had no hesitation in liquidating the account as the services had been faithfully rendered and the charge a moderate one.

It is about 290 miles from the Choctawhatchie to St. Augustine, making the whole Route 462 Miles, in which distance there would be about 240 miles of new road to open, provided this Route is approved; & I will here take occasion to remark that it is the nearest practicable Route;â€” From this place to the Suwannee I have a personal knowledge of it. In making this estimate I have calculated that the Road will be opened only wide enough for a waggon to pass with ease, & experience proves that such Roads, being shady, are most proper for a Southern climate.â€”The provisions for the troops ought to be transported by Water & placed in deposit at Fort Crawford, at the crossings of the Yellow Water, Pea River, Choctawhatchie, and Appalachicola, at Fort St. Marks & at the crossings of the Suwannee & the St. Johns.â€” DAN' E.

Having understood, & with much regret, that a Bill which is now before the House of Representatives, entitled â€œA Bill amending, and supplementory to, the Act for ascertaining claims and titles to lands in Florida, and to provide for the Survey and disposal of public lands in Florida,â€ is likely to be rejected by the Senate. And knowing, Sir, how important it is both to the interest of the United States & to the Territory which I have the Honor to represent, that it should be adopted. I beg leave respectfully, to annex hereto, Copy of part of a Letter which I have received from Mr. Nathaniel A Ware, one of the Commissioners appointed to settle land claims in that territory, with a request, that you will lay it before the Senate, and which, together with a Memorial from the Inhabitants of East Florida addressed to the Senate & House of Rep"" ""praying, Among other things, for the Appointment of An additional Board of Commissioners to settle their land Claims. I hope & trust, will prove sufficient to convince the Senate of the propriety of allowing the appointment of an additional Board of Commissioners, and to allow also the other salutary provisions contained in that Bill, â€“the title of which is herein quotedâ€” Copy.â€” PENZACOLA 27th December 1822. SIR: I take the liberty to address you, as the Delegate from Floridaâ€”relative to the Board of Commissioners for deciding on Titles to lands in Florida.â€”The Commissioners have done nothing as yet, first on account of the sickness at this placeâ€”and since because we cannot agree, at all, upon the principals that are to guide us in our decisions: (there being but two of us, the third not having come on yet) I feel bound to give the Treaty and act of Congress a liberal constructionâ€”But, the other commissioner Strickly, for the fulfilment of all the conditions and for great regularity in the grants, neither of which have been much attended to by the Spanish Government.â€” I will take us most of this year to close our business at Penzacolaâ€”I think therefore that you aught to get an other Board appointed for East Floridaâ€”It will cost no more than if the same board done it allâ€” and there will be no confusion in the Recordsâ€”for two sets of Books will have any how to be kept, one for each Floridaâ€”It is very important both to the United States and Florida, that those titles should be settled with all speedâ€”The recording can be easily done when the Boards meetâ€”so that wont delay themâ€”I think it my duty to urge you to have a new board appointed, knowing how slow and tedious we get on, altho' it will shorten the period of my office.â€â€”(Signed) Nathaniel A Ware.â€”The underscoreing has been done by myself.â€” I have also received an other Letter from Mr Joseph M. White, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, dated at Penzacola the 29"" of Dec ulto.â€ in which, he invites my attention to the necessity of appointing a Recorder & translater of Spanish Claims, at S"" Augustine at the present Session of Congress. He also adds, that the Commissioners after the session at Penzacola, will proceed immediately to S""Augustine, where, he says it will take at least six months to collect records & translate a sufficient number for to proceed to their adjudication.â€”Sir, it is now to late, to call the attention of Congress, as suggested by M. White. The establishment of a new Board is, in my estimation, the Course which aught to be adopted: Whose Secretary, shall understand the Spanish language.â€”I may not be rong in allowing my self further elusidations on this important subject; & should I have over steped the bounds of proper limits, I trust will easily be perceived & constitute an ample apology; for, they alone, lead me to appear before the Honorable Body over which you preside.â€” The Spanish Government, kept East & West Florida under two separate & distinct governments, in which much difference have arisen from the system pursued by their respective Governors, as well as in the fortuitous occurrences, which from time to time, were experenced in both Provinces.â€”In the Judiciary they were govern"" alike, when the Laws of the Kingdome, prescribe the Course of the Tribunals for the administration of justice.â€”But very different as regards the jurisdiction of the rights of their respective governors.â€” The power & priviledges which those Governors enjoyed, were also distinct & often very different, emanating either from their Sovereign, the Cap"" General & Intendant of the Island of Cuba, or from the great discretionary powers which the Government of Spain always yielded to the governors of her ultra marine possessions.â€”So much have those causes had their influence, that but few cases of either Province would be a just criterion for the other.â€” Spain like every other nation had its own peculiar system of government, extending to one portion of her dominions priviledges which she refused to others; & some times, even contrary to the general policy of her government: She gave to Floridas; & I believe Louisiana, the priviledge of enjoying the Protestant Religion & allowed foregners, who would settle in those Provinces, the rights of her own subjects, from the moment the took the oath of fidelity, and this was only to defend the Province when invaded & to be subject to the Laws of the Realm.â€” The Inhabitants were exempt from all system of taxationâ€”not even for the support of the Churchâ€”They were allowed a free school for the education of their children, without distinction of person except in sex. They paid a Duty of Six p""Cent on foregn importations & exported the produce of the country free of duty. All vacant Lands in the Spanish Colonys, were called the Kings patrimony, and as the great Lord of the National Domain, previous to the Adoption of the present Constitution of the Spanis Monarchy, he disposed of them at his will & as he judged most beneficial to the settlement of his Colonys, very often in reward of individual merit, but, I know of no instance in which he disposed of them, of his own accord, for a pecuniary consideration. His Vice Roys, Commanding & Cap"" Generals as well as his Governors, personated his Sovereignty, in their respective territorial jurisdictions; and some of them have had the confidence, in many instances, to make them selves His Magesty in person. endeed the people understood, that the acts of their Governors were guaranteed to them & that they alone were responsable to the King.â€” In East Florida about the Year 1792 a Royal proclamation was published,â€ inviting forigners to settle in that Province, making it obligatory in the Governors to grant them lands free, even from the expence of their survey. One Hundred acres were granted to the Heads of the family & fifty to every other person belonging to it. this quota was afterwards reduced by Governor White, about the year 1802â€ to fifty acres to the Heads of the family & twenty five acres to every other person thereof above the age of Sixteen. He also imposed, as conditions, that possession should be taken within six months after the grant was made, the right of which was forfited after two years abandonment, in the intermediate term of ten years possession, when any other person had the right to locate the same & retain it under the same conditions. In the year 1815 an other Royal Order was issued requiring of the Governors 7s Dated Nov. 29, 1789, proclaimed Nov. 20, 1790 (White, ed., New Colls. Laws, II, 276-277; A. S. P. Pub. Lands, v, 749). 74 Dated Oct. 12, 1803 (White, op.cit., pp. 277â€“278; A. S. P., op.cit., pp. 749â€“750). to grant, as a special act of grace, to all those persons, who had defended that Province in the revolution of 1812, a quota of land, in fee simple, agreeably to their head rights""â€”The governors of that Province, also made grants of lands agreeably to the provisions of the Laws of Indias & for the incouragement of Saw Mills, tan yards, & cattle ranges. But with the exception of those grants made in complyance of the Royal order of 1815, the titles to most of the others depended on the performance of sertan conditions respectively stated in those grants.â€”It may happen that the Governors of West Florida may have had to adopt quite a different policy from that of the Governors of East Florida.â€”I have also to state that the Act of Congress, passed last session, to ascertain titles to lands in Florida, if allowed to remain in its present shape will jeopardise the rights of the United States to lands in that territory & expose the Inhabitants to great expence; in as much as it seems to allow the existance of British emigrant right to lands there. A Right not in existance under the Spanish government. The deraingment of titles required by that Act, when the Claimant is not the original owner, may put the Commissioners & the parties to great inconvenience & in many instances, may be utterly unattainableâ€”the fees to the surveyors is to great, particularly as most of the proprietors have already paid for the survey of their landsâ€”the fees allowed to the Secretary of the Board of Commissions for recording titles aught to be repeald: nor aught the Inhabitants to be put to any expence in the exhibition of their titles or proofs of property, where the title is a bonafide oneâ€”the quantity of land on which the Commissioners are authorized to decid by that Act, would not imbrace the Planters of that Territory; many of whom, have from 20 to upwards of One Hundred workers personsâ€” Shoud not an additional Board of Commissioners be appointed this Session of Congress. I can only add, that the settlement of East Florida will be retarded at least three years longer; & whether it would be right to deprive the Inhabitants of the use of their property,â€™till after the session of Congress for the year 1825, is an injury which I hope the Senate will take into consideration I have the Honor to be With much respect Your Most Ob Serv"" JOSEPH M HERNANDEZ Delegate from Florida To the Honorable The President of the Senate.

"NA:HF, 17 Cong., 2 sess.; DS *",Memorial,MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF WEST FLORIDA DISTRICT,,,"To the Hon. the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled. The Memorial of the Citizens of West Florida respectfully sheweth: That at the last Session of the Legislative Council a Law was passed for raising a revenue in this Territory, the provisions of which subjected Lands to a Tax of twentyfive cents per hundred acres, town property to twelve and a half cents for every hundred Dollars, every free male person above twenty one years to One Dollar, and every slave above ten years to fifty cents, besides very heavy taxes on billiard tables, auctioneers, tavern licences, &c."" Since the passage of the Law, however, the Contingent expences of the Council, and printing of its Acts, have been paid by the General Government with a munificence honorable in the highest degree to its magnanimous and liberal policy. Your Memorialists are so much the more penetrated with gratitude at this liberality, as the General Government, in the midst of its multifarious and important duties, could not be supposed to have an intimate knowledge of their truly deplorable situation. They therefore respectfully represent, that a resort to territorial taxation is totally unnecessary, and in the present wretched condition of this Territory, an infant and helpless member of the Union, without population, without roads to encourage that population, and bowed still lower to the dust from the fatal effects of a most malignant epidemy, is peculiarly burthensome and oppressive. Your Memorialists would also respectfully submit that the claims to Lands and town property have not yet been, and are not likely soon to be, decided upon, so that the Claimants cannot find purchasers for almost the only means they have to look to for their support, and many of them so far from being able to pay this tax, have hardly a bare subsistence. In some cases the tax is greater than the Lands could be sold for, and in one or two it amounts to several thousand Dollars for pine barren lands. Slaves also so far from being a source of revenue to their owners, are in the present prostrate state of the Country, a mere incumbrance. Your Memorialists therefore pray that the several provisions of the aforementioned Law be for the present dispensed with: They solicit this with the more confidence, as it is a fundamental principle of the Constitution of this free Country that there can be no taxation without representation. Your Memorialists hope this favor from your known justice and liberality And they will, as in duty bound, ever pray &c.

The engagements of your Department, which are no doubt, very pressing during the Session of Congress, have, I imagine, prevented you from complying heretofore with this request.â€” In my former communication, an opinion was intimated, that the law by which the Government of Florida was organized, did not contemplate my performing the duties of Clerk to the Governor as ex officio superintendent of Indian Affairs. Further inquiry and reflection have contributed to strengthen and sustain the correctness of this position. By referring to the letter of the Secretary of War, bearing date 11""April, 1822.â€ addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and transmitting sundry statements in relation to the Indian Department, I find that the Governors of Territories are by law, ex officio superintendents of Indian Affairs,â€ and are allowed $1,500, as a compensation for Clerk hire, office rent, fuil, &c.â€” From this statement of the War Department, it would clearly appear, that the functions of Governor were seperate and distinct from those which attached to him as Superintendent of Indian Affairs.â€”In the first case, a Secretary is provided, receiving his appointment from the President with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States; in the second, the Governor is authorized to employ Clerks for a special purpose. As Governor, a salary, fixed by law, is allowed for his services; as Superintendent, no Salary is provided, but a particular sum appropriated to cover the expences incident to hiring a Clerk, office rent, fuel, &câ€”Had the agency of the Secretary been required to perform these services, he would have been so designated; his salary, it is conceived, would have been rendered amply sufficient to meet them, and this provision for Clerk hire &c be entirely superfluous. Agreeably to my understanding of the law, its intention must, therefore have been, that as superintendent of Indian Affairs, the governor is authorized to employ a seperate Clerk, for which an adequate compensation is allowed, as also a sum sufficient to cover the disbursements for office rent, fuil &c.â€” In the absence of the Governor from the Territory, when the duties of Superintendent devolves on the Secretary, it is with due deference submitted to your consideration, whether he should not be allowed the same compensation for his Services, and for the purpose of meeting similar expenditures. Thus situated, not only the ordinary services of Secretary were required to be rendered, but those in addition which belong to the Governor and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs. With this trible labor and responsibility imposed upon me, it would have been altogether impracticable for me to have discharged my duty with fidelity, without the employment of a Clerk. To this burden I have been necessarily subjected ever since the Governor's departure from Florida for the State of Kentucky.""â€” As I am averse to prefering any account against the Government which is not perfectly just and equitable, I should be sincerely thankful to you for any suggestions which would assist in forming a definitive opinion upon this subject; Of this I am satisfiedâ€”that the services have been rendered; if I am entitled to any remuneration, I am equally convinced, that the Government, in the distribution of equal justice, will be disposed to make the proper allowance.""â€” With the highest considerations of respect and esteem, I am yr. mo.

I also enclose a copy of a letter which I adressed to Colonel Williams of the Senate,â€ relative to the roads mentioned in that Bill, In hopes that you may have it in your power to adopt some plan by which they may be opened during the recess of Congress, as the late hour in which that Bill was sent to the Senate prevented that Honorable Body from Acting upon it.â€” There are now a Considerable number of troops in that territory, which, in the State of peace which we happily enjoy, Could probably not be better employed than in the opening of those Roads, which in the event of a war, cannot otherwise than prove very useful to the Nation.â€”The advantages which the territory will enjoy from them must be obvious to the Government, particularly, when it is considered, that its population is divided between S"" Augustine and Penzacola; and that the nearest practicable route, by which they can at present communicate with each other, is, by land, upwards of seven Hundred Miles.â€” The Course which I have pointed out for the road from S""Augustine to Penzacola, is the same which the acting Governor suggests in his communication to you of the 31* Janâ€™ last.â€ & which reduces the distance considerably from that on which the estimate of expense was founded, & will effect the same object.â€” If the Government were to make a Donation of a Suitable tract of land, at Such place as Should be deemed the most eligible for the Seat of the territorial Government; Say, about the Suwanee, where the lands are represented as being fertile, high & healthy, the two Provinces, as under the Spanish Government, might be continued united, And soon become a respectable State in the union,-Whereby, it would be enabled to support the expences of its own Government. Under the existing Circumstances of the two divisions of that territory, it is with great difficulty, that one portion of the Members of the Legislative Council can attend at their place of Meeting, which, must either be held at S"" Augustine or Penzacola.â€”Were it not, Sir, for the high respect which the Inhabitants of that territory have for the President and the imperative dictates of public duty, I am confident that no person, competent to discharge the duties of that station would accept of such an appointment: The alternative being presented to them of performing a long and dangerous voyage of near 2000 Miles, or of travling by land, on horse back, upwards of 700 Miles, through an unsettled; And during the seson of rains, an almost impassable Country. The Compensation allowed to the Members of that Legislative Council, for travling, is only three Doll"" for every twenty Miles, which is scarcely adequate to defray their expences. These disadvantages will be obviated as soon as a Communication is opened through the territory; as the distance then will probably not exceed 380 Miles between the two Cities.â€”The Seat of Government Aught to be fixed as Near the Center as possible, in order that the population of the two Sections of the territory may be brought near each other, and mutual relations of interest and union be thereby established and strengthened.â€” **. I will further beg leave to Call your attention to the condition of the Indians of that territory.â€” Measures Should be adopted to Consentrate those Indians, as they are now dispersed throughout the whole territory. If Suita- and judicious Gentlemen, Known to enjoy their Confidence, were Selected to Assemble their Chiefs & other influencial Men of their tribes, to acquant them with the favourable disposition of the Government towards them, & to Make them Sensible of the indispensable necessity of their abandoning the Chase, & the propriety of resorting to to Agricultural pursuits; and who should be empowerd to allot them a Suitable place where they could plant to advantage and attend to the increase of Stock. I Make No doubt that this great object would be accomplished Much to their own interest and that of the Government. Those Indians, for Many years, were the principal persons, who supplied S"" Augustine with Cattle & Horses, untill the year 1812 when they were forced from their Settlements; And being thus broken up, have continued ever Since, without the least Kind of Spirit of industry or enterprize,â€”they could at one time have been Considerd, as having arrived at the first Stage Civilization, & with judicious Management, they can be restored to their former Condition &, become, as before, useful people.â€”But, I Nevertheless, entertain some fears that from the Notions which have lately been impressed on their minds, in regard to their being the ligitimate proprietors of Most of the lands West of the river S"" Johns, May oppose an obsticle to bringing about this desired arrangement. However, Should the troops be employed in the opening of the Road from S"" Augustine to Penzacola, they will come very much in aid of the endeavours of the Government to effect this object.â€”As the appointment of persons to treat with them is of vast importance, I would Suggest the propriety of Making the selection from those persons who are Known to possess their confidence. The Indian agent, being a Stranger to them, would not possess this advantage; And Acting alone, might find it difficult to make them believe, that he was not exclusively devoted to the interest of the United States.â€” I would further beg leave to Solicit your attention to the subject of the Public property in the Cities of Penzacola & S""Augustine,â€”The Committee of the House of Rep"" to whome was referred a Memorial from the City Council of S"" Augustine, praying for a Donation of Certain public lots & Houses, for the Use of that City,â€ & a Resolution of Mine relative to similar property in the City of Penzacola,â€ from the Multiplicity of business before them, added to the shortness of the late Session of Congress, were prevented from making any report thereon. I have therefore, respectfully, to request you will com- municate this circumstance to the President of the United States, in hopes that he may be pleased to direct, that such of said property as is not required for Revenue or Military purposes, may be retained in the possession of the Corporations of said Cities, till Congress make a disposition of it, â€”And to give directions to the Military Commandent to permit the use of dry and Wholesome appartments in Fort S"" Marks in S*Augustine, for the Confinement of criminals & debtors, untill the resources of the territory will enable it to build a Jail. I Am the more induced to call your particular attention, And of the President, to the Subject of Public property, from having learned, that an unfortunate misunderstanding, has Subsisted between the Civil & Military Authorities of that place, which is at all times much to be deprecated.â€” I cannot conclude this Letter without assuring you that the former Subjects of Spain, residents of Florida, fully appretiate all the advantages, to be derived from their territory becoming an integral part of the United States; And a Knowledge of the Marked attention which Congress, during the present Session, And also the Exicutive, have been pleased to show to every Suggestion which which had for its object the promotion of their interest will further Unite them with their fellow Citizens in the bonds of Amity And Confraternity.â€â€” I have the Honor to be with Much respect Your Most Ob Serv"" JOSEPH M HERNANDEZ HONORABLE J C CALHOUN Sect of War.

Last autum during the fatal pestilence which prevailed here I received a letter from M Sullivan of the department of State accompanying the volumes of the laws of the U.

Subsequent to that time I have received the 7"" Vol. of Wheatons report, and a supplement to the census. There is a subject of great importance to the Goverment on which I intended to address a particular communication. The quantity and quality of the live oak and cedar, in the vicinity of the Sea from this place to Appalachicola I am well convinced is very greatly underrated. Among the papers of a M. Saltenstall upon whose estate I administered I found an answer to a letter addressed by him to an eminent ship builder accompanyed with drawings of the different pieces used in the construction of ships, from which it would appear that a scheme had been formed to cut this valuable timber on speculation. The information enabled me to form a more correct estimate of the value of the timber, which is very great. Persons are now engaged in cutting cedar, and it is not unlikely that unless measures are taken they will commence upon the live oak. The proximity of the cedar to ship navigation is a most important consideration.

The great consideration in fixing on the scite is the visibility of the Light House, which will depend on its projection toward the sea and elevation above the surface of the Water, but the firmness of the ground and freedom from Quick sands are also matters of consequence. Great care must therefore be used in making the examination and reporting evey particular of the nature of the elevation, accessability of the place, and generally the local advantages and dissadvantages of the situation, if the ground is private property measures must be taken for ascertaining the price, unless the proprietor from a desire to promote such important improvements, should be induced to give it gratis.

A number of proposals for constructing the lighthouse dated early in 1824 are to be found in NA(TD, Bids, Contracts and Proposals). The successful bidder was Winslow Lewis, of Boston, Mass., with whom a contract was made on Apr. 13, 1824, which is recorded in NA(TD, Lighthouse Deeds and Contracts, Bk. D). Steps were taken during 1823 to reconstruct an old Spanish lookout house on St. Anastasia Island at St. Augustine for use as a lighthouse.

Applications for the appointment as keeper were received from John Andreu, a pilot and resident of St. Augustine, to the President, Feb. 23, 1824; William Brown, of the same place, who had served as keeper of the Spanish signal tower there, to the President, Apr. 13, June 17, 1824 (postmarked); and Henry Ayers, a sergeant in the 4th Artillery, Feb. 22, 1824, who was recommended in a letter from R. Weightman to John Rodman, June 23, 1823, and an unaddressed letter from Edgar Macon, Feb. 23, 1824 (NA, TD, Lighthouse Keepers' Applications). Pleasonton informed Rodman, Mar. 16, 1824 of the appointment of Andreu, (NA, TD, Lighthouse Letters, Bk. 6). Pursuant to an act of Congress approved May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 61), preparations were initiated during the first half of 1824 for the construction of lighthouses at Sambo keys, Careysfort Reef, Dry Tortugas, and Cape Florida.

In relation to compensation for your Services as acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs, in the absence of the Governor, I have to State that the law affixes no compensation for the services required of the territorial Governors as Superintendents of Indian Affairs of which you appear to be aware; but it has been usual to allow the expenses which they may incur in the performance of such duty, for clerk hire, office Rent &"" upon an account rendered for the same, certified by the Governor, in cases where no specific allowance for that purpose has been made. This rule is considered equally applicable to the Secretaries of the Territories, while acting as Superintendents of Indian Affairs in the absence of the Governors; and if you will render an account for your expenses, for Clerk, Office rent &"" certified by yourself, it will, if deemed reasonable, be allowed. I have examined the estimate which you forwarded, and it would gratify me to admit it for the whole amount, as I have no doubt a due regard has been had to economy in making it out; but the very limited appropriation for the Indian Department renders it necessary to confine the expenses to as small an amount as possible, without absolute injury to the public interest; and I am therefore constrained to restrict the expenses of the Indian Department in Florida, for the present year, to the Sum of $3,500â€”to witâ€” Pay of Indian Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1500,00 Pay of Sub Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500,00 Presents to Indians . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500,00 Contingences, which includes all other Expenses . . 1000,00 $3,500,00 A remittance of half this sum is now made to you for the expenses of the two first quarters of the year; and I have no doubt every care will be taken to make it adequate to the object.

Your efforts will therefore be directed to the attainment of this object. Should there not be a sufficiency of good lands for the accommodation of the Indians in that part of the Peninsular designated, you are authorised to fix the boundary north of Charlotte Harbor and River, so as to take in as much of the Country between them and Tampa Bay, as in your judgment may be necessary to give the Indians enough of good lands, and sufficient space considering their habits of life, leaving the conditions to your sound discretion. As it is desirable that the Treaty should be held as soon as practicable, you will as early as convenient make your arrangements for that purpose. Confiding in your prudence that the treaty will be held with the least possible expense, it is deemed unnecessary to give you any particular instructions on that point. The principal article of expense will probably be the issue of provisions to the Indians while treating with them. To avoid the delay which a correspondence between the Commissioners for the purpose would occasion M"" Segui, being most convenient to the Indians will fix on the time and place of holding the treaty after consulting M"" Hernandez the Delegate from the Territory, and notify Col: Gadsden the other Commissioner, thereof. Mr Segui will also ascertain the quantity of provisions that will probably be required, and issue his requisitions for the Same on the Commissary of Subsistence at S* Marks if the treaty should be held at that place or Contiguous to it, or on the Commissary at S*Augustine if it should be held there or near it who will be ordered to obey such requisitions, and charge the amount to the Indian Department. The enclosed circular will be complied with in issuing the provisions, to which, as there has in some instances been great irregularity, I particularly call your attention. The Indian Agent Col: Gad Humphries who is stationed for the present, at S*Marks is instructed to obey your orders on all points connected with the proposed treaty, and to prepare the Indians to meet the Commissioners at the time & place which may be fixed upon for holding it.â€ For the funds which you may find necessary to defray the expenses attending the negociation, you will draw on this Department. Your compensation will be at the rate of $8 and that of the Secretary to the Commission, (whom you are authorised to appoint) at the rate of $5â€”per diem, for the time actually engaged. The payment will be made on your Certificate of honor, specifying the time that you and the Secretary have been actually engaged.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters: ALS",Correspondence,SECRETARY WALTON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,SECRETARY WALTON,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR, Herewith enclosed you will receive a statement of my account with the United States.â€ You will observe that I am debited with the receipt of $5000. and have credited myself with the several items of expenditure in numerical order. There are several of these last which require some explanation to be clearly and distinctly understoodâ€” The accounts of Messrs Mitchell & Brownejohn for copying the acts of the Legislative Council are cases of this description. These two gentlemen were employed in the first instance to perform this labour in order that the printer might be furnished with a copy in pursuance of an Act of the Legislative Council. When completed it was considered expedient by the Governor that it should be forwarded as speedily as practicable to St. Augustine. The adoption of this step created the necessity of having an additional copy executed to secure the object for which it was originally intended. This will satisfactorily explain to you the second account of M. Brownejohn, who performed the task in conformity to the directions of Governor Duval. The sum of $300 paid Col. de la Rua, for the rent of a building appropriated to the purposes of a Court house, was in my estimation sanctioned by justice & propriety. It had been rented by the Clerk of the County Court during the administration of Gen' Jackson, and devoted to the use of the public for twelve months; under such circumstances I had no hesitation in believing the account a just one and liquidated it accordinglyâ€”Upon submitting it to the Governor it appeared to meet his decided approbation as I hope it will that of your Departmentâ€” Relative to the expenditure for printing the acts of the Legislative Council you will observe that there has been paid the sum of $1238.12%. This account has been settled in conformity with estimates prepared by the printers of Mobile & New Orleans which was to be adopted as the rule of settlement in the original contract. These estimates were not presented in a shape to be satisfactory and the printer insists that they are 33% per cent below the regular prices charged in the offices at the Eastward and greatly below those which have heretofore been established in Mobile & New Orleans. He proposes obtaining estimates more in detail than those received & if it can be satisfactorily ascertained that the latter were too low I have given assurances that the balance shall be promptly discharged. I felt myself authorised to give this pledge from a confident belief, that it was not desirable to any department of the government to obtain individual services without making adequate compensation The bill of $91, for printing the ordinances &c of Gov"" Jackson, although presented at this late period I have no doubt is perfectly just and should have been paid. I am myself conusant of the printing having been done by Nicholas & Tunstall in obedience to an order of Gov. Jackson and I have the positive declaration of Maj. Nicholas that the account has been inadvertently overlooked in former settlements. In this statement I have no hesitation in reposing the utmost confidence, and flatter myself that the appropriation to meet this account will meet your approbationâ€” Upon the item embracing the rent for an office, I have to remark, that it has always been kept in the house occupied by my family. During the months of July, August & September rents continued very high, and all the publick buildings were in the occupation of the officers and soldiers of the U. States Army, In consequence of the prevalence of disease in Pensacola my office was removed to & remained in the Country during the months of October & November. For this latter period no expense was incurred; from the first of December until this time I have been under the necessity of renting the same house for the above purpose but upon much more moderate terms. Upon my return to this place I found that the Government house which had been delivered over to the civil authority was in such a state of dilapidation as to be unfit either for an office or residence for my family; and there was unfortunately no other building surrendered that could be appropriated to those purposes. In this condition of affairs I had no discretion. The Government house was turned over to the different courts of Justice where they have since held their sessions and this was the only useful manner in which it could possibly be employed â€ With sentiments of the highest consideration I have the honor to be Yr.

I had intended to travil in company with Governor Duval, who left this about two weeks since for East Florida; but have been unavoidably detained by my own illness and that of my family. At present, we are all upon the recovery; and I am in hopes to be enabled to take my departure from Pensacola on Saturday next *â€” The serious inconvenience and expence to which I am exposed, in consequence of the seat of Government for this Territory not being permanently located, will be readily suggested upon the least reflection. I am compelled to be some time seperated, at a considerable distance from my family, and to meet disbursements which will almost absorb the whole of my salary. It is very desirable that these difficulties should be obviated as speedily as practicable, and relieve me, as well as others from the embarrassments which they have created. Were the seat of Government permanently fixed, either in East or West Florida, or at a central position, equally convenient to both sections of Territory, it would be perfectly immaterial, so far as my individual interests are involved; but until this is accomplished, I cannot remove my family from Pensacola, with any confident assurances that they will remain for more than one year in a different portion of Florida.â€” The 3"" section of the â€œAct for the establishment of a Territorial Government in Florida,â€ makes it the duty of the secretary to transmit authentic copies of the proceedings of the Governor in his Executive capacity, every six months, to the President of the United States.â€ Except in those cases where civil and military appointments have been made within the Territory, all the acts of the Governor in his Executive character, have consisted of communications forwarded by himself to the Department of State.

It was not until sometime in the month of Oct or Nov 1822 that we made our joint account against the United States for these services; this was transmitted with a power of Att to John Law Esq at Washington to present for payment & to receive the amount from the Government on our account. Soon after, we were informed of the lamented death of John Law. His brother proceeded to Washington, by him Colonel F. & myself entrusted our accounts with a power of Atty, as before to John Law. Since then I have not heard from M. Edmund Law, or, the fate of my charge against the Government for these services so faithfully rendered. I have understood, that the Colonel was at Washington last winter and that he probably received for himself the amount charged for his services on the occasion in question.

Humphreys, Indian Agent, which he addressed to me just upon my departure for St. Augustine, accompanying a talk he delivered to the Headmen and warriors of the Seminole Indians, and the reply of Eneamathla, their principal chief; copies of which are also forwarded.- You will find from the talk of Eneamathla, that the Indians feel much solicitude about their future location. He is, however, believed to be incorrect in stating, that General Jackson told them in a talk, they should keep the lands they now live on at Tallahassee and other places, excepting that near the seaboard. In the talk delivered at Pensacola, no such pledge is to be found; but a declaration substantially to this effect; that they should remain on the lands they occupied, or be removed or concentrated at some convenient point within the interior. It is also evident from this reply, that although the Indians are disposed to cultivate the habits of white men; yet they are not willing that they should settle near them, or be crowded upon their towns and villages. They are desirous of continuing a separate and distinct people; and to effect this, they ought to be removed, so that they may be embodied upon the same tract of country. This should certainly be far removed from the seaboard, and sufficiently high up in the interior, so as not to break the continuity of white settlements which are to connect and consolidate East and West Florida.â€” From Colo. Humphrey's communication to me, it appears, that it has become necessary he should remain here, to attend to the prosecution of Maturin Simon, for a violation of the â€œact to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers.â€ After this business is disposed of, he is direeted instrueted required to repair to St. Marks, where he was directed to reside in my former instructions.â€” In relation to the Interpreter, Stephen Richards, against whom Colo. Humphreys has been partially engaged in investigating charges, I have to remark, that from the information which I have been enabled to collect, his conduct has been much misrepresented. I have, however, instructed Colo. Humphreys to prosecute the enquiry until he arrives at a satisfactory result, and if he finds him unworthy of the appointment to dismiss him.""â€” A draft on the Branch Bank of the United States, at New Orleans, for one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars, has just been transmitted to me by the Treasury Department, which I have been compelled to forward to that place to be negociated.

[Enclosure:ALS] Gad Humphreys to Secretary Walton PENSACOLA, 19"" April 1823.â€” SIR; I have the honor to give you the following statement of my proceedings in a visit to the Seminole Indians, in the neighbourhood of St Marks. I regret that a want of time previous to your departure, for St. Augustine, does not allow me to be as full and explicit in my narative as I could wish; A more minute detail shall be reserved for a future communication. The enclosed is the substance of a talk given at a meeting of the Indians at St. Marks on the 20"" Ultimo; and the accompanying replication, by Enehe Mothla, the head Chief, who speaks the sentiments of his Nation,â€â€”as far as I can understand, will afford you the most correct view of my opperations, and and at the same time exhibit the feelings of the people with whom I have had to communicate. I must not omit at this time, to state as a fact of apparent interist which may have influence on the measures hereafter to be adopted in relation to these people, that keeping in mind your Instructions of the 21* January, I made it a consideration of primary importance to ascertain the disposition and views of the Indians in relation to the cultivation of the Soil, and the adoption of the habits of civilized life, and I am happy to be enabled to say, that my inquiries have resulted in a seemingly well founded belief, that very little more is necessary to bring them into the measure, than to furnish them with the proper Implements of Husbandry, and locate them upon a tract of Land sufficiently fertile to reward and encourage their labours. Although the settled practice of hunting for a living appears appears almost inseparable from their nature, yet the sensible and reflecting among them begin, even at this period, to look upon it as a precarious and uncertain means of subsistence, and urge with reasonable but unyielding pertinacity, the necessity of providing ef previding other and more stable sources of support. They declared themselves satisfied with what they heard at the Talk, and said that notwithstanding they felt great solicitue to know their destiny, yet they were resolved to wait patiently the the determination and orders of the Government on the subject, in the belief that strict justice would be done them. They appear in general well disposed, and not inclined to be troublesome; yet there is a manifest impatience felt to be informed of the Intentions of the United States towards them, which they cannot disguise if they would; they assert with much plausibility, that the incertitude of their condition, precludes the possibility of their making those permanent arrangements so essential to their comfort and well being. How long their present docility of temper may continue it is impossible to say, and I beg leave to take the present occasion to suggest that the sooner they are attended to, and provided for the better.â€” On the subject of the complaints against inst Yellow Hair, second Chief of the Chockenickla Town, mentioned in your letter of the 28* February,â€ I have to report, that the charges do not, on inquiry appear to be true to the extent at first represented. He is not, however, I apprehend, altogether free from impropriety of conduct; The other Chiefs have promised to investigate the matter, and deal with him according to their own laws, as they may think he deserves.â€” The white Inhabitants of the Country, speake well of the deportment of the Indians generally, as being peacible and innoffensive.â€” In relation to the allegations against the Interpreter, Mr Richards, which your last communication required me to investigate, I must remark, that the examination I have been able to make. (not altogether a satisfactory one) induces the conclusion, that although he is not so far culpable as was supposed, yet a portion of his conduct, since his appointment is in a high degree reprehensible. Notwithstanding this however, I have deemed it inexpedient for the present to remove him, as I find it utterly impossible to supply his place by any efficient or competent substitute; I shall therefore continue him until further instructions on the subject are received. I have been under the necessity of seizing, on the Apalachicola River, a vessel and cargo of Maturin Simon, of this City, for a violation of the act of Congress of the 6* May 1822, in anmendment to an act entitled â€œAn Act to regulate trade & intercourse with the Indian Tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers,â€ passed 30"" March, 1802â€”also for breach of his Licence, he having contrary to the terms of said Licence, and in direct violation of the Law aforesaid, not only carried Spirituous Liquors into the Indian Country but sold and issued the same to the Indians, at Blunt's Town, and other places, to the very great Detriment of the Public Good. Information has been lodged, the property Libelled, and the matter put into the hands of the District Attorney, Major Steele from whom, I under- stand the cause will be tried in all probability, at the next May Term of the Superior Court of this District.â€”The District Attorney has notified me, that my presence at the trial will be essentially requisite; if an arrangement for that purpose will not be seriously incompatible with my other official duties. He thinks it desirable for the success of the prosecution.â€” My accounts for expenditures on the tour will be ready in a day or two and shall be forwarded either to yourself or Gov"" Duval.â€â€” I have the honor to remain With the highest respect Your Obed"" Serv't G.

"NA:SD, Applications:ALS",Correspondence,SAMUEL R. OVERTON TO THE PRESIDENT,SAMUEL R. OVERTON,THE PRESIDENT,"Dr SIR; The Act â€œAmending and supplementary to the act, for ascertaining claims and titles to land in the Territory of Florida and to provide for the survey and disposal of the public lands in Florida,â€ was not long since, transmitted to this place by M. Hernandez. Being the only Commissioner in West Florida, I without hesitation, assumed the responsibility of announcing, through the medium of the newspaper published at Pensacola, that our session had been pro- longed until the second Monday of February, and that our office was open for the reception of claims, which must be filed before the first day of December next. I did not consider this measure entirely regular; but as it grew out of the necessity of the case and was calculated to accomplish the object in view, it was promptly adopted.â€” Maj' Ware, had, some time previously, taken his departure from this place for the state of Mississippi, and had not returned. This step was urged, as I understood, by a regard to his own health, and that of his children, with the intention to return as soon as the third Commissioner and the law extending our term arrived, unless prevented by a continuance of the causes which produced his absence. I have not yet heard from him and cannot state any thing positively as to his determination. It is rumored here, but with what correctness I cannot say, that he is upon a trip throâ€™ the Western country, and that he will not return to Pensacola. The continued ill health of his children has, no doubt, compelled him to adopt this alternative, and he will, it is presumed, resign his appointment as Commissioner. Anticipating such an event, I have again considered it my duty to address you upon the subject. It is by no means my wish to be obtrusive; but feeling the solicitude I do for the public interest, it is to hoped the freedom in which I shall indulge will be pardoned. The performance of our duties has, heretofore, been so long suspended by disease, and other events, over which we had no controul, that it is very desirable we should now be enabled to make some progress. The claimants are becoming impatient, and begin to express their dissatisfaction. Under such circumstances, I would respectfully recommend, that no time be lost in filling any vacances which might occur in the Board. I would again press upon your attention, the necessity of appointing Jos. M. White Esq of this place, to supply the first which may be presented.â€ He is better qualified than any other individual, either in or out of the Territory; and with myself, would be enabled to complete the business of the commission in the smallest practicable period. Were any other person selected, it would require a devotion of 3 or 4 months to the study of the claims, before he would be prepared to decide them. I do therefore, most sincerely hope, that Mr White may be appointed, should there be a vacancy, occasoned either by the resignations of Maj' Ware or Colo. Preston. If there are two vacancies, I would recommend Judge] G. A. Gaither, who has been sometime a practicing attorney at St. Augustine, and a member of the first] Legislative Council. He is well qualified, as to capacity, and an acquaintance with the laws and ordinances of Spain, and does not, I am advised, own a foot of land in the Territory, which is an important consideration. Judge Gaither will be at Bardstown, Kentucky, where a notification of his appointment could be directed, and in a week afterwards, he could be transported by water to this place.â€” With the most profound respect and esteem, I am y' mo. obt.

By placing the Revenue Cutter, under the Command of the inspector, he would be able to prevent the British Wreckers from taking those Goods out of the United Statesâ€”before the duties were Securâ€™dâ€”. This Trade has been injoyâ€™d by the Inhabitants of the Bahama Islands, Since the first Settlement of those Keysâ€”they appear to Consider it as their right, and are determinâ€™d to persevere in it, untill our Goverment, by the adoption of Some energetick Measures, Shall Compell them to withdrawâ€”The extent of this Trade & the very Serious injury done to the Revenue of the U"" States by the English Wreckers, may be estimated, by the number of Vessels employ'd in itâ€”and also by the amount of Duties paid by them to the Custom House in Nassau-. I mention'd to you, in my Letter of the 10 In"" * that I had boarded the British Brig, Gen' Phipps' of 300 Tons, on the Reef, near to Key Tavanier The Captain & owner appeard to be a Man of an improvâ€™d Mind, and possessing very general Commercial information, on the subject of this Letter we Convers'd very fullyâ€”He observed that there were a Number of British West Indiamen lost on the Reefe every year, that the property generally fell into the hands of the Wreckers, & that Such was their Conduct & general charactersâ€”he had reasons to believe, that the underwriters receiv'd but little Benefit from their assistance, That in all Cases, where a British Wessel was Wreckâ€™d; it would afford much Satisfaction, to their Commander, to meet with some publick officer to whom they might commit, that part of their Cargo sav'd from the Wreck; & that the want of some Establishment of this Kind, was sensibly felt by all those Mariners, who were so unfortunate as to fall into, the hands of the Wreckers, It is therefore solely with the view, to save those Goods from falling into the hands of the Providence Wreckers, and the duties, on them totally lost to the U"" States, that I would advise the immediate appointment of an Inspector, and the establishment of a Store House, near a Central part of the Reefe; The Island of old Mattacombe is situated near the most dangerous part of it, and has also the advantages of a good Harbour & good Water, another consideration is, that it is in sight of Key Tavaniere, the principal resort of all the Wreckers, from these reasons, & from a personal inspection of its Situation, & advantages I have been led to Select it, as the most desireable place; either for the Establishment of a Store House, or the Location of the Inspectorâ€”From this port, to Cape Florida, a distance of 250 Miles, there is no Settlement on the Coast & from the Cape to Key West a distance of 180 Miles, there is only one Settlement; thus in a distance of 430 Miles on our Coast, in the immediate Vicinity of the British Portsâ€”there is no Custom House officer, or Revenue Cutter;â€” When our Goverment take into their Consideration, the extent to which the Wrecking (and as intimate'ly connected with it, the Smugling) business is Carried on in this part of our Coast, and the great advantages which might accrue to our Revenue by this establishment; It is to be suppos'd, they will furnish the means, necessary to suppress this Evil-.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:LS",Correspondence,GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,GOVERNOR DUVAL,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"HON. JOHN QUINCEY ADAMS Secry of State for the U States SIR I have the honor to inform you that on saturday last the Legislative Council have commenced their Session. Nine members have appeared & more are not expected to attend. I have been compelled to rent an office for the Secretary, as none of the public buildings here which are tenantable are under my control, the Council occupy the only habitable room in the Governors old mansion, & it has been rendered so by Judge Smith, for the purpose of holding his Courts. I am obliged to get some cheap furniture for the Office but all of it will cost but little, as I shall have it made of Pine, & will only take as much as is absolutely necessary. I enclose you the Printers account for publishing the laws of the Territory, at this place Amo"" $472.75, which I think too much. it would perhaps be best to allow no more than the price paid by Governm"" for publishing the laws of the United States, this being once understood, the subject will give little trouble in future. Last July, when the members of the Council arrived at Pensacola, several of them informed me, that the Archives & public records which had been delivered over to M* Edmund Law by Mr Worthington while acting Goveror, were very negligently kept, & that M Law had been in the habit of permitting persons to take out of his office as Alcalde original papers, & that on leaving S*Augustin to attend the Council at Pensacola he turned the papers over to some private individual, beleiving it my duty immediately to have the papers collected and placed in safe keeping, & to guard against any improper conduct either in withdrawing from, or adding any papers to, the record. & as many of them were in loose sheets filed I directed M"" Gibbs & James S. Tingle Clerks of the superior & inferior courts of this City to take into their possession the papers, & make out an inventory of all the important ones so that if hereafter any fraud should be attempted it can be easily detected. this was done promptly & these Gentlemen have preferred a Claim, for this service. I wrote to them that they would have to depend on the Gover"" for such compensation as might be deemed reasonable. I trust Sir you will not consider my having directed this measure as an improper interference on my part. I was induced to do so from a conviction that serious injury would arise to the interest of the United States if I postponed acting until after I could communicate with you at Washington. I wish to enquire if Congress at their late session made any appropriation for the payment of the expenses incurred in this City, in the Maintenance & prosecution of Criminals, the fees due to Cap"" Hanham the Sheriff are considerable, he has advanced the money himself & is now in serious distress for the want of it. I is highly necessary in my opinion that the Secretâ€ Col. Walton should return to Pensacola after the Council adjourns, the difficulty of communication between that City & this, retards in a great measure the operations of the local Government, & the sectional feeling that prevails in this territory makes it requisite that while I am in one section of the Country the Secretâ€ should be in the other. I shall therefore direct his return to Pensacola, the want of his services & advice will be sensibly felt by me. I must however under the present state of affairs submit to this inconvenience, I request of you or the President that some reasonable allowance from the contingent fund, may be paid to a Clerk, whom I shall be compelled otherwise to pay out of my salary, a very moderate allowance will be sufficient.

"NA:OIA, SW Lets. Sent, Bk. E",Correspondence,THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR DUVAL,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,GOVERNOR DUVAL,"HIS EXCELL"" Win P DUVAL S*Augustine Florida SIR, Your letter of the 1* inst: enclosing your account as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, has been received.â€ All the items in your account will be allowed, with the exception of that for clerk hire, office rent &"" which cannot be allowed at the rate which you have charged. It is true, that the specific sum ($1500) charged, has been allowed to Governors Clark,"" Cass"" & Miller,â€ but the allowance was made to them under peculiar circumstances which are not considered at all applicable to your Superintendency. For some time previous to the appointment of Gen Clark as Governor of the Missouri Territory, he acted under the authority of the President as Agent for Indian Affairs at S Louis with a salary of $1500 per annum,"" and during which time no allowance was made to the gentleman, who preceded him as Governor of the Territory, on account of the duties performed by him as superintendent of Indian Affairs. But at the assumption of the duties of Governor, in 1813, by Gen'l Clark, the Office of Agent for Indian Affairs was abolished and the duties and authorities which were vested in him, were thereafter placed in the Governor, who, for the performance of the same as well as for clerk hire, office rent &"" &Â° for the Indian Department was allowed the Salary previously given to the Agent.* The Governor of the Missouri Territory, by this arrangement, not only had to perform the duties of Indian Agent at S* Louis, where the intercourse with the Indians has always been great, but had also the control of all the Jndian Agencies on the Mississippi and Missouri, which rendered his duties in the Indian Department highly responsible and laborious; and in consequence of which the specific allowance of $1500 a year was made to him as before stated; the whole of which was for incidental expenses necessarily incurred, or for extra compensation for extra services. The same may be said as to the compensation of the Governor of the Michigan Territory who has under his control as Superintendent of Indian Affairs several Indian Agencies, some of which are located without the limits of the Territory and the duties of which he is not bound by law to perform. Besides superintending the Agencies, he is charged with the immediate performance of the duties of Agent for the Indians residing within the Peninsula of Michigan; with paying the annuities which are to be paid by treaty at Detroit, amounting to a large sum & involving a heavy pecuniary responsibility; with the expense of attending to the numerous Indians that resort to that place, and with preventing the intercourse of the Indians within our limits with the British provinces: For which extra duties, as well as for clerk hire, office rent &"" the specific allowance of $1500 was deemed not more than an adequate compensation, and is believed to be not much more than sufficient to cover his actual expenses.â€ When General Miller entered on the duties of Governor of the Arkansas Territory, there was no agent to attend to the Osages and Quapaws, and he had a difficult negociation to effect between the Cherokees and Osages, who were at war, which required great personal exertions and expense in making long journies to meet these tribes for that purpose. Under these circumstances, the same allowance was at first made to him; but since a treaty of peace has been concluded between the Cherokees and Osages, and the trouble and expense has in consequence become less, the allowance has been reduced one half; and is intended to cover all incidental expenses as well as for extra duty performed as Agent to the Osages and Quapaws, who have no agent, in paying their annuities &c."" It does not appear that any specific annual allowance was ever made to any governor of a territory for the performance of the duties of Superintendent of Indian Affairs as such. In the three cases mentioned, it was intended to secure the Governors against loss by the performance of such duties; and as extra compensation for the performance of extra duties. Under all these circumstances, I have no doubt you will see the impossibility of extending to your Superintendency the rule adopted in the three cases referred to. I am perfectly willing, however, to place you on a footing with respect to compensation, with the Governors of every other Territory who have acted as Superintendents of Indian Affairsâ€”that is, to allow you, (if it should be necessary in the discharge of your duties as Superintendent of Indian Affairs to keep an office and employ a clerk,) a reasonable sum for that purpose; and also the expenses which you may necessarily incur in your intercourse with the Indians. As it would perhaps be difficult to keep an exact account of your expenses when travelling on business with the Indians, or otherwise engaged in attending to their concerns, the allowance will be made on your certificate of honor as to the actual amount of such expenses. But as the Florida tribe is very small and their intercourse with S*Augustine limited; and as there is a subagent for the post who might be charged with the duties of attending to such Indians as may visit it, my impression is that you will not find a clerk necessary, at least while he is present, and that if an Office be indispensable, an arrangement might be made by which you could be accommodated in one of the public buildings. If, however, you should find it necessary to employ a clerk and rent an Office, you will immediately report the name of your clerk with the rate of compensation allowed him, as well as that for the Office, for the determination of this Department.â€ I have &c.

SIR, Your letters of the 22"" * & 26"" ultiÂ° * have been received. You appear to understand perfectly the ground on which the allowances were made to the Superintendents of Indian affairs in Missouri, Michigan and Arkansas. The number of Indian Tribes & Agencies under the control of each of the two former; and the peculiar State of Indian Affairs in the Arkansas Territory at the time the latter entered on his duties, rendered a special allowance necessary to cover their actual expenses and secure them against loss on account of the duties performed by them respectively in the Indian Department. In no other cases has a special annual allowance been made. Had the practice been uniform, there would have been no difficulty in your case, but as it has not I cannot admit your account. From the very candid view you have taken of the subject, I feel convinced you will see the propriety of this decision and cheerfully acquiesce in it. If you had actually incurred expenses in the performance of duties in the Indian Department they would have been allowed without hesitation. The additional instructions which you have given to the Indian Agent are very proper, and it is hoped will be strictly attended. The draft of the Agent for his first quarter's Salary has been presented here and paid.

that there is not the most friendly disposition prevailing between the different Tribes, and that there is quite a division of opinion among them as to their concentration and locationâ€”The Indians occupying the Peninsula, it is believed, are pleased with the Selection, South, made by the Executive; while those West of the Sewaney river, and particularly within the Appalachecola district are most attached to their own Country and would prefer it is said even an emigration West of the Mississippi to a concentration South of Tampa Bay as contemplatedâ€”At the head of the discontented is Eneomatla, an enterprising daring Savage, and if not the only, among the principal instigators of the Seminole Warâ€”These conflicting interests, and opinions will be the chief difficulties the Commissioners will have to encounter in effecting a treaty; and although there is no doubt as to the ability in the national Government of dictating & enforcing the terms desired; a resort to that Alternative, as a matter of policy, may be questionable, where the views of the Executive may be effected otherwise amicablyâ€” Magnanimity would dictate the latter course; however necessary an exercise of power may be in extreme casesâ€”It has been thought proper to present these facts to your consideration, suggesting the policy of additional instructions to the Commissioners conditionally authorising them to provide for those Tribes that may be disposed to emigrate Westâ€”It is possible that all the Florida Indians might be induced to remove, and if so an object as vitally important in a national as a territorial point of view would be gainedâ€”Florida as a maritime district of the American union is peculiarly exposed; possessing more than 900 miles of sea coast with Capacious bays or Estuaries easy of access; and her good to her inferior lands bearing but a small proportion and the territory consequently unsusceptible of a dense population, she must ever be as internally weak as she is externally assailable â€”An Indian population under these circumstances, connected with another class of population which will inevitably predominate in Florida, must necessarily add to natural weaknesses, and endanger the security of one of the most exposed, but important frontiers of the Unionâ€”It is useless therefore to enlarge on the policy of removing a class of Savages from where they may prove dangerous, to where they would be comparatively harmlessâ€”Should the Executive approve of the views taken on this Subject, it will be necessary for the guidance of the Commissioners, minutely to designate the district of country West which may be offered in exchange for the Country abandonedâ€” In connection with the concentration of the Indians South of Tampa Bay, there are many subjects to which your attention may with propriety be invitedâ€”The Indians hitherto have been formidable in Florida, and the change of flags has not removed from the Citisens all apprehensions, or all recollections of former impressionsâ€”The location, South, is by some thought injudicious, and though a large majority concur with the Executive in the views taken on the Subject, all agree that a Military Post within or near the limits of the nation will be indispensableâ€”The Indians have long been in the habit of keeping up an intercourse, and active trade with the Cuba Fishermen, and to this cause principally has been ascribed the encouragement hitherto given to absconding negroes & savage depredations committed on cattle Estates &c.â€”There is no difficulty in correcting the evil hereafter; but the presence of a military force will be necessary to the result and the sooner the position is selected & occupied the sooner will the excitements to illict trafic be removedâ€”The first impressions are with the Savage most permanent, & a judicious location of an adequate force simultaneous with the concentration of the Indians cannot but have the happy effect of obtaining such a controul as to render them perfectly Subservient to the views of Governmentâ€”From conversations held with many who have explored partially the western Coast of Florida, I am inclined to think that the Bay of Tampa presents the most eligible site for a Military Post & offers many favourable & healthful positionsâ€”More ample information however on the subject shall be collected, previous to the accomplishment of the object of our mission; in time to be acted on should the occupation of the position suggested be approvedâ€” Will you be good enough to issue orders to the Coms Officer at Sâ€ Augustine to furnish the Commissioners with a Military Guard;

S. in such perfection as here. It has been Sir, my endeavor to punish the defaulters directly in person, or indirectly by the seizure of the timber, but the timidity of some of the executive Officers has defeated the intention and the offenders profit largely by the impunity thus secured. The U. S. Marshal of this District declines acting at all in the matter until regular processes are placed in his hands so as to entitle him to mileage &c. for the arrest.

I feel myself somewhat at a loss how to act in this business, which appears to be one of peculiar delicacy. I thought that the first proper step was to remove all cause of suspicion and complaint from the authorities of Cuba, reserving to myself the right of acting as circumstances might hereafter make necessary. I beg your early instructions on this subject both as regards the disposal of the property and the course I ought to pursue toward the cruiser, (which claims the character of a Government vessel,) if she should be detected, and the individuals (aiders and abettors) residents at Key Wicas. The goods from that place are, invariably, I am informed, sent to Norfolk, where, it is likely, a strict scrutiny might detect a more extensive concern. 1107â€“1108; NA, ND, SN Captainsâ€™ Lets., 1823, Bk. 6).

Additional letters concerning the West Indian squadron can be found in the correspondence files of the Board of Navy Commissioners.

Masterson (Washington, 1945). At the end of 1824 Commodore Porter was recalled to Washington for an investigation of his transactions at Foxardo, Puerto Rico connected with the suppression of piracy. Several compilations of documents that resulted from the court of inquiry and the court martial that were held in the following year contain numerous references to Key West where the West Indian squadron was based. See the following works: Robert Beale, A Report of the Trial of Commodore David Porter . . . before a General Court Martial (Washington, 1825); David Porter, An Exposition of the Facts and Circumstances Which Justified the Expedition to Foxardo and the Consequences Thereof.

Other manuscript documents are to be found in the correspondence files of the Secretary of the Navy in NA. As wrecking, on this coast, is a business of great importance, and extensively carried on, I should be glad to be informed whether there are any laws to regulate it. Previous to my coming here, the neighboring Keys were much frequented by English wreckers who took the property to New Providence, but the detention of two of them by Lieut. Com"" Watson"" occasioned an alarm which has since kept them from the coast. A correspondence took place between the Governor of Bahama and myself on the subject which I have the honor to enclose you. It is my opinion that much smuggling, if not already practised will be attempted. It is out of the power of any Custom House officer here to prevent it; and, having had some experience in these matters while at New Orleans, I know that, without being clothed with some authority from the Treasury Department, I can not lawfully make a seizure. Whatever powers are given to me I will exercise whenever the public interest may require it, and I solicit from you early instructions how I am to proceed.""

I have not allowed vessels coming from foreign ports to land their cargoes, but have sent them elsewhere, persuaded, as I am, that there can be no motive in their doing so, but the interest which they hope to derive from illicit practices. To vessels going coast-wise I give a certificate stating the cargo, if any, and the fact that there are no revenue officers there. There are no Custom House fees collected however, and this is the only inconvenience felt from the want of a Collector, a consideration not worth taking into account as the number of vessels which arrive and depart is so limited. 75 William H.

The Government is, however, willing to encourage the removal of the Florida Indians as far as it can, and if all, or any part of them should be disposed to emigrate, and join the Cherokees or Choctaws or any other tribe farther west, that may be willing to receive them, you are authorized to include a stipulation in the proposed treaty on the subject, allowing them in the event of their emigration what may be deemed by the Commissioners a fair consideration for the lands relinquished by them in Florida, and agreeing on the part of the United States to pay the expenses attending their removal. Your suggestion relative to the establishment of a military post will receive due attention. Orders will be given agreeably to your request throâ€™ the Adjutant General to the Commanding Officer at St Augustine to furnish the Commissioners with a military guard. - The Rifles required for the presents at the treaty will be furnished throâ€™ the Ordnance Department.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS",Correspondence,JUDGE SMITH TO THE PRESIDENT,JUDGE SMITH,THE PRESIDENT,"TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. STATES SIR, Before I left Augustine, I learnt that a statement respecting Colonel Hamilton, had been secretly circulated obtained various signatures of Minorcans and Spaniards resident in Augustine and been forwarded to you.â€ The statement it was understood, consisted of allegations or declarations, claimed to have been made by Col Hamilton, pending the late Election in Florida, as to the course he would pursue as Commissioner of Land Claims, in regard to those Electors who might vote for or against him on that occasion, and ended with a request to the President of the United States for his removal. The Election was attended with great warmth & personal excitement. M Hamilton was one of the Candidatesâ€”And from this fact, & the strong attachment of the Spaniards and Minorcans to M.â€ Hernandez the other Candidate, have been produced all the false impressions and misapprehensions, which have led to the statement against Col Hamilton. But I do not believe Sir, that there is a person of intelligence & integrity in Augustine who doubts the official honour & integrity of Col Hamiltonâ€”or who unexcited by passionate feelings, produced as I have stated, would have made an allegation against him. His appointment as Commissioner was acceptable and popular in East Floridaâ€”It still may be viewed substantially soâ€”the excitement must soon pass off, which grew out of the Electionâ€”M* Gomez to whom M Hamilton was said to have made the objectionable remarks has but a very limited knowledge of English, and is most liable to misapprehend what he hears in that Language-On his own application I excused him from serving as a Juror, because as he said his knowledge of the English language was too deficient. I know nothing against the integrity of M* Gomezâ€”he is called an honest manâ€”but I believe with those here, who best know M* Hamilton, that the utmost reliance may be placed on his integrityâ€”& that his official duties will be discharged faithfully. I have taken the liberty Sir, to write this letter, from a regard to justice, & in the hope that it may prevent any undeserved impression being made on your mind, from the communication, which it is supposed you have received.

I understand that he caught the yellow fever at Havana, and died shortly after his return. Your presence is therefore indispensable; the more so as the revenue Cutter is now ready for service. Until you arrive, or until another Deputy can be appointed, all business at the Custom House must be suspended. I have had several intimations that a plan was in contemplation to enter coffee and other West India articles there for re-shipment to other ports of the Union. As it is difficult to conceive any fair or honest motive for such a course, the suspicion naturally arises that illicit practices will be resorted to by those who engage in it. It will therefore be an imperious duty to exercise the strictest inspection, and the utmost vigilance as to the solvency of those who offer themselves to bond duties at the Custom House.

"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS",Correspondence,SAMUEL R. OVERTON TO THE PRESIDENT,SAMUEL R. OVERTON,THE PRESIDENT,"SIR; I have patiently remained here until this time, under the expectation, either that Colo. Preston would arrive, or the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Maj' Ware be filled,"" so that a Board might be formed, and enabled to proceed in the execution of their Commission. In this calculation, I have been much disappointed. I have not yet been advised who will succeed Maj' Ware, or when the arrival of Colo. Preston may be expected. This state of things is to be regretted the more, inasmuch as the claimants are extremely solicitous to have their titles ascertained and adjusted, and as we have been already exposed to unusual delay in the accomplishment of this object. Besides, the United States are greatly interested in expediting the business of the Commissioners, so as to bring it to an early close, and enable them speedily to expose their lands to sale.â€” I have already recommended several persons to fill the vacancy of Maj. Ware, as well as that of Colo. Preston, should it occur. I feel myself again urged to call your attention to this subject, and should it be considered too inportunate, I am in hopes you will excuse it, and attribute it to a sincere desire to progress with the performance of my duties. To continue here during the Summer and Fall, exposed to the diseases incident to those seasons in this climate, without any prospect of forming a Board, is a delay which is extremley discouraging and painful, and from which I should be much pleased to be relieved.â€” M. Joseph M. White of this place, has been repeatedly pressed upon your attention, as better qualified to fill either of those vacancies, than any individual who could be selected. He is a gentleman in whom the people here repose every confidence, and his appointment, I am assured, would meet with universal approbation. He was recommended because he was known to you, and from a consciousness of his qualifications. A regard to the intraests of the claimants and the United States, again constrain me to urge the appointment of Mâ€ White to fill the first vacancy that is presented. It is particularly desirable as it respects the speedy and faithful execution of our duties. If two new members of the Board join me, who are unacquainted with the laws and ordinances of Spain &c. in the distribution of lands, almost the whole burthen, at this stage of the business, will be thrown upon me.â€ This is more than my present state of health would bear, impaired as it has been by the irregularities and inclemency of the past seasons. With the aid of M"" White, who is well acquainted with the duties to be performed, we could proceed with but little difficulty.

"NA:WD, SW Lets.

I believe without vanity I may say, that I am well acquainted with the Indian character, and I have no hesitation in saying that that the Government will experience some difficulty in concentrating the Florida Indians at the proposed point in the Peninsula, they being only the Renegado Creeks who have wandered there. A movement of the Troops to Tampas bay, previous to the Talks being held with them, would have a powerful influence upon their minds, and give great effect to the Talks of the commissioners: Will you therefore permit me to suggest to te you the propriety of sending to Tampas bay, one half of the 4"" Reg' of Infantry now at Pensacola? It would have a very beneficial effect. I have fully communicated to Co' Gadsden my ideas on the subject of the approaching negotiation, and would further suggest the propriety of giving to the commissioners discretionary powers to locate the Indians, either, within the Peninsula, or, on both sides of the Apelachicola extending,-West ten miles,â€” East to Oclockney River, and South within five miles of the Ochesee Bluffsâ€”Here they can be concentrated, and will leave a free communication from East to West Florida crossing the Apelachicola at the Ochesee Bluffs; and all the good lands on the Choctaw Hatche, and East of the Oclockney to the Alatchua plains, and on the margin of the Gulph, preserved for a dense White population,-sufficient to overawe the Indians, and keep down the insurrection of the Blacks, of which there must be a large number in the Floridas at some future day. If it be the particular desire of the Executive to make this concentration within the Peninsula, permit me again to repeat, that the appearance of a Garrison of Regulars at Tampas bay will be necessary to effect it at the desired point. Nothing short of this, as I believe, will procure it,-as by it, the talk of the Commissioners will have force, â€”without it, will be ineffectual, and calculated to inflame the Indians. My real desire that my friend Gadsden should be successful in his first essay as commissioner, and also that the best interest of Florida should be promoted, has induced me thus to obtrude these ref [MS. torn] suggestions upon your mind, trusting that they will be read with that spirit of friendship with which they are written.""

There is no statute of the United States regulating the disposition of property wrecked on our territory; but the common law contemplates all wrecks as the property of the Sovereign.

The reason of this last objection of ours will be perfectly understood by the following explanationâ€”The Spanish mode of keeping their Archives is as follows An official Letter from the Governor to the Captain Gen.

"NA:OIA, SW Lets. Recd. 1823:LS",Correspondence,GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,GOVERNOR DUVAL,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,"SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27"" May, referring to my account, as Superintendent of Indian affairs in this Territory, rendered in to your Department."" The item which I find objected to, is a specific sum of $1500, debited by me for office rent, Clerk hire, and other expenses attending the discharge of the duties of that situation, I have no desire to receive from the Government, any money but what I am justly entitled to, and I am bold to hope, that when the circumstances under which I have been placed are considered, my demand will not be deemed unreasonable. Altho' my situation materially differs from that of either Governors Clark, Cass, or Miller, yet I can with great confidence assure you that it is, and has been, attended with many peculiar inconveniences from which they were exempt. Until the arrival of the Agent, last winter, the duty of attending to the Indians devolved on me, the total inability of Cap"" Pelham, from his ill health, to do the duty of his office,â€ and the acting Agent Col. Eustis having been stationed at S* Augustin, precluded the possibility of my receiving any assistance from either of these Gentlemen, in the Western part of the Territory. The fever which prevailed at Pensacola last season, obliged me to leave that place, and owing to the illness of the Secretary Col. Walton's and his family, I found it necessary to employ Alfred W Hines, as a Clerk, to whom I paid several sums of money for his services, as well as his board. I perceive you are misinformed as regards the number of the Florida Indians, and their intercourse with this City, they are scattered over the greatest part of the Territory, and since my arrival here not a day has passed in which several have not been in town, they are constantly coming and going, and almost always call on me. the Spanish Governors invariably treated them with great respect and ceremony, as they dreaded giving them the slightest offence, and I deem it prudent not to make any change in this intercourse until after the treaty. Many of these Indians possess considerable property, and as licences to trade had before my arrival been given to every person who applied and offered Security, various disputes have arisen between the Indians and those traders, which occupy my attention daily, and as I feel it my duty, to have the strictest justice done in these cases, much of my time and attention is occupied in their investigation. In order to hear the talks of the Indians, and transact the business connected with them, I have been obliged to rent an office with a large Room, but after October next, I do not believe I shall be under an absolute necessity of renting a house for this purpose. Under the impression (however erroneous) that the sum of 1500 Dollars would be allowed me to cover the expenses of Office Rent, fuel, stationary, Clerk hire, &cc I never kept an Account of my actual expenditure, except that of the sums received from your department, and cannot consequently certify the exact amount on my honour. You are now informed that Thomas Murphy has acted as my clerk from the 1* May to 1* Sept'. I employed him without agreeing to pay any certain sum, but his compensation was to be submitted to your discretion, he has performed much service, and as yet has received nothing, the expense of living is high, and a Clerk cannot obtain decent boarding in this City, for less than from 7 to 10 Dollars per week. I will only remark that after October, I shall endeavor to do all the writing myself, and will save (as far as I can do so without neglecting my other duties) your department from every expense that can be avoided, consistent with the public interest. 20 Cf. ante, p. 697, n. Governor Harrison * of the former territory of Indiana, and Governor Edwardsâ€ of Illinois, must I presume have been somewhat similarly circumstanced with myself. I am ignorant of what they received as Superentend"" of Indian affairs, but I conceive myself justly entitled, to the same compensation, which can be ascertained by reference to the allowance made them. Were I disposed to look for any thing more than what I am fairly entitled to, I am satisfied the order, regularity, and Economy of your department, would prevent such an expectation from being realized, for the same reason I look with confidence to such an allowance as has been usually made in similar cases, and at once submit my claim to your judgment and decision. I also beg leave to request that you will fix upon a specific sum for my future allowance, in order that I may make arrangements suitable to it.â€ With the highest respect I have the honor to be Sir Your most ob"" Serv"" Wm P.

Q Master Pensacola SIR, So soon as the season shall permit, you will commence the survey of a road, on the most direct practicable route, from Pensacola in West Florida, to St. Augustine in East Florida. Previous to commencing the survey, you will examine, or cause to be examined, the country between yellow Water"" & St. Rosa'sâ€ bay, and if it be sufficiently high & dry, to admit of a good road, that route would be preferable to that which you recommend by Beeler's ferryâ€” the convenience for crossing the Bay at the town of Pensacola, it is believed, will be greater, and the ferriage in consequence, more certain than at Beelers: besides, some distance will be saved, and Cold water bay and Yellow water river, as well as Beeler's ferry, will be avoided. Should this route be found practicable, it might intersect that proposed by you at, or near, the ferry on Choctaw Hatchie.â€ It is believed that the route proposed by you thence to Ochessee, on the Appalachicola, is preferable to any other. From the Appalachicola to St. Augustine, you must endeavour to make the road as short and direct as the nature of the country will permit.â€”The route must be marked by cutting, or, as it is called in the Western Country, blazing trees at convenient distances, so that the Troops ordered to open the road, may trace the route without the aid of a guide. The commanding officer at Pensacola will be instructed, by an order from the Adjutant General's Office, to place under your command, a subaltern officer & such number of non com"" officers & soldiers as may be found necessary. You will employ guides, & provide the number of horses, mules, tools & instruments, which the service may require. Having completed the survey, you will make to this office, a detailed report of your proceedings, as soon as you possibly can, taking care to note particulary the nature of the country, the quality of the lands, the number & condition of the Indians, in the vicinity of the proposed road, the nature of the ferries or fords over the several rivers, or other waters on the route; and every other circumstance which you may consider of sufficient interest to be known. You will also report, whether in your opinion, it may not be necessary to station small detachments of troops, at convenient distances on the road, until the country be settled, to afford protection to travellers, as well as to the mail; and to facilitate the communication between the two territories.â€” You will also, make a detailed estimate of the probable sum required to open the road, & forward it to this office. I return to you the map which you sent to me on which I have marked â€” â€” â€” â€” the route proposed between Yellow Water & St. Rosa's bay.â€ When you shall have completed the survey of, the road to St. Augustine,â€ and have forwarded your report and estimate, you will then survey the mail route which you proposed between Pensacola and Fort Mitchell, and make a similar report & estimate.â€ I am, Sir. &,",1823,September,11,1823-09-11,,531,1823.0911
"NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS",Correspondence,JOSEPH M. WHITE TO FONTAINE MAURY,JOSEPH M. WHITE,FONTAINE MAURY,"SIR, I received your letter by the last Mail requesting me to forward my account for services as District Atto of West Florida to you for adjustment.â€ I have already forwarded them several months since to the other department, upon the subject of which they have not favoured me with any answer. I am gratified to learn that they are to be adjusted at the Department of State. I was appointed by the Judge of the Superior Court to attend to the interests of the United States at a period when the Court was crowded with important business of the Government, and at a time when no Attorney had been appointed to fill the vacancy of the late incumbent. I was offered a much larger sum to appear for the Defendants than that charged to the United States. In the first account I forwarded to the other Department, I charged the sum of ten Dollars for each prisoner or Defendant tried in Court. We have no fee fixed by law for the prosecution of offenders in this Territory, and upon reference to the Act of Congress fixing the compensation of Attorneys, I find they are allowed as in the Courts of the State in which the prosecution is carried on, and if there is none allowed by the laws of that State, then those of the nearest District. I have now made out my account charging fifteen dollars, being the fee in criminal cases in Alabama, and I am informed by the District Attorney there that that sum has always been paid to him, and in cases of Piracy an additional compensation allowed: all that I demand is what the law allows me. Shortly after my appointment some of the most valuable public buildings were taken possession of by British Granteesâ€”I prosecuted writs of Forcible Entry & Detainer against them in the County and Circuit Court of the Territory, at great trouble and labor, until they were evicted, and the houses redelivered, by the Sheriff, to the Quarter Master and are now in the possession of the United States. I consider the account, herewith enclosed, a just and legal statement of what I am entitled to, which I will thank you to submit, as early as possible, to the Hon. Secretary, and the amount, or whatever portion thereof, may be allowed, I will thank you to remit in a Check upon the Branch Bank of New-Orleans, or give me authority to draw upon you, on the Bank at Washington, whichever may be most convenient to you.â€ I am, with high considerations Of Respect Your Ob"" Serv"" JOS: M.

Florida requesting him to institute suit against James Forsyth Master of the Schooner Thomas Shields of & from New Orleans for having landed Slaves at this port contrary to the provisions of the 9* Section of the Act of Congress passed March 2"" 1807. for the Suppression of the Slave trade.â€ It appears from M* Steeles reply (a copy of which is also enclosed) that such offences cannot be prosecuted in the name of the U. States, an opinion in which I imagine few Legal men will concur, The Security of the Revenue in its collection as also the preventing the illegal introduction of Slaves (in relation to which the most benevolent means have been adopted by the Section alluded to in imposing a penalty of $10.000. on the master of the Wessels who violates it) depending entirely upon a Salutary & rigid enforcement of the Laws, when they are enfringed wilfully & with intent to defraud & as such cases may daily occur, I consder it a duty imperatively incumbent upon me as the Deputy Collector of this port to insist that an Attorney be appointed pro tem by the court to prosecute all suits arising from infractions of the Revenue Laws & those relating to the Slave trade. If the doctrine of M* Steele is admitted the Laws may be violated with impunity, & the refusal on the part of the District Attorney to act I consider equally as great a disqualification, as death, disability or absence, in all of which cases the Court exercizes the prerogative of appointing a successor. An additional evidence of the District Attorneys having totally mistaken the nature of the duties imposed upon him, will be found in a letter addressed by him to me on the 25"" ultâ€ (of which tho containing other matters, a copy will be furnished if necessary) demanding of me $20 for appearing as counsel in the case of M.

By a reference to the bill filed in the case it will be found that this suit originated in consequence of the seizure of a certain number of casks teneriffe wine by the Collector through his Deputy; being the original casks of importation and were not accompanied by the necessary Certificates of legal importation prescribed by the 23"" & 26* Sections of the Act of Congress passed March 3â€ 1799.â€ it is to be inferred from his making the demand, that as in the other Case, he views this as a qui tam action.

I have received information, that a considerable number of these Slaves have established themselves on Pine Island at the mouth of Charlotte river, & are well armed with Spanish Muskets &cc, & that they refuse to permit any American to visit the Island. The Indians state that some Spaniards are with them who have several small vessels carrying from one to three Guns each & that these Negroes are employed in cutting timber on the Island, and in fishing for the Havanna market. The owners of these Slaves continually solicit me to send a force to take them, but I am unable to comply with their wishes, as I cannot call out the Militia without an order to that effect, nor have I the means of arming or obtaining rations for those who might be employed. If the President would permit me to call out fifty or sixty of the mounted Militia, to be placed under the command of the Indian Agent, Col. Humphreys, who should also be empowered to take with him such Indian force as may be deemed necessary, these slaves can be apprehended; there must be several hundred of them in Florida. I hope the President and yourself will at once perceive the importance of authorizing me to act speedily in arresting the refugee Slaves at Pine Island, and elsewhere in this Territory. As the Agent Col' Humphreys will hand you this letter, I refer you to him for such other information on this Subject as you may desire to obtain; & all the arrangements which the Government may deem proper in order to carry into effect the objects of this communication may be made with him. I have the utmost confidence in Col Humphreys & assure you that he is an active, and energetic Agent, possesses a great command over the Indians, & has rendered his Country during the late Treaty the most valuable services.

On the 21"" instant you were advised by mail of our having concluded a Treaty with the Florida Tribes of Indians *â€”The 2"" No reply found. See post, p. 752. Article of the Treaty, accompanying this will inform you of the Boundaries assigned them, which with the other articles agreed on will be found in our opinion to correspond with the spirit of our instructions, as well as the humane policy of our governmentâ€”The want of a knowledge of the Country South of Charlotts' Harbor, and the impossibility of inducing competent individuals to explore, or of obtaining any satisfactory information relative to that region, necessarily prohibited the Commissioners from confining the Indians to that quarter agreeably to the views of the Executive as first expressed n our instructions-A Northern Location, though desired by a Majority of the Indians, was violently opposed within the limits recommended by Gen' Jackson; to have extended beyond those limits would have been injurious to the best interests of Florida-A Southern location was objected to by the Indians on the ground that the Country South of Tampa did not contain a sufficient quantity of good land to furnish the subsistence of lifeâ€”That force only could drive them into whole Territory of Florida except a large reservation, to which the Indians were to be removed, and a half dozen small tracts reserved to six of the principal chiefs who were to be allowed to remain thereon with their connections. For the boundaries of the reservation lying in the heart of the peninsula east of Tampa Bay, and the chiefsâ€™ reserves, see Charles C. Royce, Indian Land Cessions in U. S. (Bureau Amer. Ethnology, 18 Annual Rept., pt. 2), plate 14, cession desig. 118, 119, 176, 184, 185. The journal of the proceedings, which embodies also a number of relevant documents for the period Apr. 7-Sept. 26, 1823, is in NA (OIA, Treaties, Talks, and Councils), and is printed, A.S.P., Indian Affairs, II, 431â€“441. The documents in question anent the treaty, not otherwise printed or cited in the present volume, are as follows: the Secretary of War to Gadsden, July 31, 1823 (ibid., p. 436), that if the Indians are unwilling to concentrate south of Tampa Bay, the alternative would be the Appalachicola, as suggested by Jackson; DuVal to George Murray, July 29, 1823 (ibid., p. 435), that Murray has been appointed secretary to the Indian commissioners, and that he was expected to mark out the spot for the treaty meeting and to attend to other necessary arrangements; id. to Lt. Brown, assistant commissary, July 31 and Aug. 28, 1823 (ibid., pp. 435â€“436,437), relative to rations for the Indians; id. to Capt J. Erwing, Aug. 26 and Aug. 27, 1823 (ibid., pp. 436, 436â€“437), concerning a military guard for the conference; Gadsden to the Secretary of War, July 29, 1823 (ibid., p. 435), that Agent Humphreys had reached St. Marks and would assemble the Indians to the treaty grounds; id. to Richards (interpreter), June 7 and June 9, 1823 (ibid., p. 433), that the commissioners expect him and Humphreys to assemble the Indians from west of the Suwanee; id. to Humphreys, June 6, 1823 (ibid., p. 432), that Sept. 5 had been agreed upon with the Seminole chiefs for the conference and Humphreys is requested to make all arrangements for the attendance of the Indians; Humphreys to Gadsden, July 3, 1823 (ibid., p. 435), that the chiefs of the Seminoles west of the Suwanee would be informed of the Sept. 5 meeting; Capt. J. Erving to DuVal, Aug. 27, 1823 (2 letters, ibid., pp. 436, 437), that a guard would be provided for the treaty conference; talks at the conference, Sept. 6, Sept. 10, and Sept. 11, 1823 (ibid., pp. 437-439). In addition, see DuVal to the Secretary of War, Sept. 1, 1823 (NA, OIA, SW Lets. Recd.), that Humphreys had arrived at St. Augustine Aug. 20 with 850 chiefs and warriors. those limits, and that they were well convinced that the Americans possessed the power, and they not the ability to resistâ€”The Indians therefore threw themselves on the protection of the U States; and appealed feelingly to the humanity of the Commissioners not to locate them in a country in which they must inevitably starveâ€”We knew nothing of the Country but from vague, and contradictory representations; the appeal therefore was listened to so far as to embrace within the limits assigned the Indians a small tract of Country about 30 miles north of Tampa Bay, containing within its boundaries many of the Settlements of the Southern Chiefsâ€”Even this extension North was not considered as removing the objections urged; to satisfy therefore all parties and convince even the Indians of the humane disposition of the American government towards them, an article was incerted that if on examination by the Commissioners &c appointed to run the line it should appear that there was not a sufficient quantity of good land within the limits allotted them, then the North line should be extended so as to give satisfaction on this pointâ€” The reservations made in the Appalachicola district were in favor of six influential Chiefs, whose assent to the Treaty could not have been obtained without this equitable provision for them & their connectionsâ€”They are all represented to be men of industrious habits, and who have made some advances in civilizationâ€”Blunt & Tuske-Hajo have been long friendly to the Americans, and rendered essential services to Gen' Jackson during the operations in Florida, on the termination of which they were permitted to reside where they now do under the protection of the United States, with a promise that when the Indians in Florida were disposed of, the provisions now made for them should be taken into considerationâ€”We view these reservations as among the most favourable terms of the Treaty; The lands allotted each Chief & their connections are so limited, as to force the occupants into the civil habits and pursuits; while so large a subtraction is made from the Indian population to be concentrated, as to render that population more easily manageable The Treaty however was the best we could effect and we are inclined to the opinion that the boundaries to which the Indians have been limited will be found, on reflection, to be the most judicious in a National, as well as Territorial point of viewâ€”Justice has been done to the Indians by assigning to them a sufficient quantity of tillable land, with the addition of an extent of Territory alike favourable as hunting grounds, and for the grazing of Cattle; while the position is so central as to admit of being encircled by a white population capable of overawing and controlling their uncivilized propensitiesâ€” We deem it our duty before closing our mission to invite your attention to some important subjects as intimately connected with the accomplishment of the views which have dictated the policy pursued by the U States towards the Indiansâ€”It was a misfortune to Florida as a frontier Territory and with her maritime exposure to have any Tribes of Indians within her boundariesâ€”It would have been a National benefit to have removed them to a more interior position; but as this seems to have been impracticable; the only course left was that which has been adoptedâ€”The Confining the Indians within certain limits, and in that part of the Territory least objectionableâ€”This being accomplished it is indispensable for the benefit of the Indians; as well as the future security of Florida that all intercourse with foreign Countries or Individuals exercising an influence over them be cut off, and that an exclusive control be obtained and maintained by the American Governmentâ€”This is only to be effected by the immediate establishment of Military posts at the Bay of Tampa, Charlotts Harbor, and at some other point near Cape Florida on the Eastern Coast, with such other salutary laws regulating the Trade with them as your own sound judgement may dictate-It is scarcely necessary to state to you that a Majority of the Indians now inhabiting the Territory of Florida and included as parties to the treaty just effected, are wanderers, if not Refugees from the Southern Indiansâ€”Many of them are of the old Red Stick party whose feelings of hostility have only been suppressed not eradicated, and even the Native Seminoles have ever been of a most erratic dispositionâ€”These Indians are now scattered over the whole face of Florida, but a small portion of them having any settled residence; a majority wandering about for such a precarious subsistence as the esculent roots of the woods, or the misfortunes of our Navigators on the Florida Keys may afford- To bring together these discordant and fermenting materials; to embody such a population within prescribed limits, afnd] to conquer their erratic habits will require in some degree the exercise of authority, with the presence of a military establishment adequate to enforce itâ€” These Posts therefore, in our opinion, should be established before the boundary line is run and markedâ€”Such a military disposition of an adequate force would produce an impression upon the Indians most favourable to an immediate concentration within the limits allottedâ€” The Military establishments recommended from the protection they would afford, will further induce an early settlement of the country now open to the enterprise of emigrants; the presence of which population will assist materially in forcing the Indians within the limits allotted them & in obtaining that control so much desired- As an act of justice to Lt Ripley who commanded the detachment of Troops on the Treaty ground; & of Lt H Brown the Asst Commissary of Subsistence we most cheerfully testify to the Zealous, active faithful discharge of the various duties assigned them - Col Humphreys Indian Agent, & Mr Richards the Interpreter likewise rendered us essential services during the complicated difficulties we had to encounter-In assembling and marching the Western Indians through a Wilderness of 250 miles in extent to the Treaty ground, they have been exposed to privations & expenses giving them strong claims on the Department of War for extra compensation;

At the request of the keeper of publick Archieves of East Florida, I have examined his office and feel no hesitation in saying that a surrender of the papers in his possession will be attended with much inconvenience and detriment to the inhabitants and persons holding or claiming property in this territory. Those accustomed to the regularity of American offices, can form no conception of the manner in which Spanish offices are kept; their proceedings and records are huddled together without any regard to order or system, for a bill of sale, mortgage and power of Attorney, though totally unconnected, are sometimes recorded upon the same sheet of paper; and at the end of the year all papers relating to that year, no matter of what nature, are bound up into a volume, though it has not unfrequently happened that in many instances the publick documents have not received this attention Should the keeper of the publick Archieves place them in the hands of any person, I cannot conceive how many suits can progress, especially where they relate to personal property, or where powers of Attorney are called in question; in as much as the person into whose hands they may come, cannot give certified copies of them, and that such copies if given, would not be received as evidence in a court. Every person who will take the trouble to inspect the archives of East Florida, must say that a seperation of the papers relating to land from the papers connected with personal property, without a destruction of all written evidence of right of property in East Florida is totally impracticable.

"NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., C248:DS",Petition,PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT BY INHABITANTS OF THE TERRITORY,,,"TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES The petitioners whoes names are underwritten, beg leave to represent, that the Territory of Florida, whilst it was a possession of foreign nations, was a refuge, for fugitive slaves from, the United States, and particularly from the States of South Carolina and Georgia. That property of this description, has at various times and to great amounts been allured from the possession of its rightful owners; or escaping voluntarily, has been protected & defended not only by the Indians,  but by the Constituted authorities of the province; so that from the date of the Revolution up to the Change of Flags, it has been utterly impossible for your petitioners, and other Sufferers, to reclaim their property.â€”We beg leave also to represent, that since the latter event, notwithstanding the difficulty of exploreing the Country, many of the Claimants have succeeded in ascertaining, where their Negroes are to be found; that some of them are claimed to be the property of Indians; some are still in a state of freedom in the Indian Territory, and are protected, by the regulations, made to restrain the intercourse of the Whites with that People, â€“Some have escaped to an Island or Cluster of Islands off the Western Coast of Florida, & are protected by an armed Banditti: Others have been carried, by Wrecking Wessels from the Cape & keys to the Bahamia Isles. Your petitioners know not the number of all, or either of these detachments, but have much reason to believe, they amount to more than One Thousandâ€”Your petitioners (some of whom have been deprived of the use of their property, ever Since the War of the Revolution) in Common with the numerous Class of Sufferers in the States before alluded to, looked, with Great anxiety to the acquisition of this Territory, as a period to their privations, but were bitterly disappointed, when their hopes were postponed to a time, infuturo & uncertain when a treaty should be held with the Indians.â€” That period has arrived and elapsed, without bringing with it any redress for our long Continued wrongs, the Commissioners not having any authority, to make or execute any arrangement on the Subject: so that, whilst the Law furnishes to the Indians ample means of redress for the aggressions of Whitemen, we are Constrained to look on with patience, whilst they possess and enjoy the property, justly and rightfully Ours;â€”And still it is held obnoxious to law, and improper, to take from their Territory, even those negroes, that are unclaimed and unpossed by the Indians; and this too at a time, when there is much reason for believeing that they are gradually escapeing from the Continent; or, alarmed at the Change of Government, are putting themselves under the protection of individual Indians, who claim them as their private property merely to protect them from their rightful owners. To arrest these inconveniences, Your petitioners appeal directly, to the Chief Executive of the United States, with a confident belief that he will exert his ample power, to restore them to their long defered rights. To this end they beg leave to suggest to Your Excellency, the investiture of ample discretionary power, in the Governor of this Territory, in whom your petitioners have the most unlimited Confidence: together with the erection of such a tribunal as will be able to test the right of property in Contest between Indians and Citizens of the United States. - - - - But these suggestions are made, with the Greatest defference, and with the utmost Confidence, that the facts being now before Your Excellency, Whatever is right, will be done: "" With These Sentiments and wishes we are your Prayerful petitioners A.

"NA:WD, QMG Letters Recd.:ALS",Correspondence,DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,DANIEL E. BURCH,THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,"GENERAL, Conformably to your order of the 15"" May last,â€ I have the honor to report such facts relating to the proposed roads to be cut, as I have been able to procure from information & by personal observation, with Estimates of the probable expense attending each.â€” From this place to Blakely there are three Routes now travelled. The first by carriages, crossing the Perdido River at a Ferry 21 miles from here, and thence until it intersects the Road from Blakely to Claiborne, 14 miles above Blakely. The Second is a trail crossing the Perdido at a ferry a few miles lower down & thence directly to Blakely. The third, also a trail, to a ferry over the Perdido where it expands into a Bay three miles wide. The first of these Routes is estimated to be 70 miles, the second 53 & the last 65 miles. Each passes over level pine barren. The first & last cross no streams except the Perdido. The Second, besides the Perdido, crosses the Rocheblave & Styxâ€”inconsiderable Streams easily bridged. The Middle Route is to be preferred because it connects the two places in the shortest line & will be but little more expensive than those which are circuitous. I recommend however that it should cross the Perdido at the upper ferry, because where the trail crosses it, the river Swamp is nearly a mile wide and so low as to render a raised causeway or kind of bridge necessary for most part of that distance, whereas there is no Swamp at the upper ferry; it will not increase the distance more than 5 miles to cross here & besides a Bridge can be thrown across the River at this point without difficulty & at a small expense. I estimate the entire expense of this Road at $4200.â€”There is a trail from this place towards Mobile point, crossing the Perdido at the lower ferry, but it terminates at the head of Bon Secour Bay, an Arm of Mobile Bay, about 15 miles from the Point. This last 15 miles however can be travelled on horseback by crossing the narrow neck of land, about three miles wide, over to the Sea Beach & then on it to the Point. This neck of land is for its whole extent a succession of sand ridges running for the most part prallell to the coast, & through them it would be difficult to find a good route; but it is quite possible that one may be obtained by digging away the intervening cross Ridges & thus connecting the low intervals with each other. At all events the Sea Beach will itself afford a firm though exposed road. Instead however of crossing the Perdido at that ferry, I would recommend establishing a new one still lower down crossing it where it is only half a mile in width & by this ferry the route would be more direct perhaps than that the trail now is upon. There is another route might be adopted for the road to the point;â€”to continue on the proposed Road to Blakely until it crosses the Perdido & then file off to the left for the head of Bon Secour Bay & thus avoid the wide ferry altogether; but this would be circuitous, -70 miles at least, whereas the direct route will not exceed 50 miles.â€”I estimate the expense of opening this Road on either route at $6000. I beg leave also to suggest the propriety, as well as importance in a military point of view, of connecting Blakely with Mobile Point, by a road to intersect that from Pensacola at the head of Bon Secour Bay; the distance from Blakely to the point of intersection will be about 35 miles.â€”I estimate the expense of this road at $3000.â€”Blakely is connected with Mobile by a Steam Boat, Ferry Boat; the distance between the two Towns is nine miles.â€” From this place there is a good Wagon Road to Frazier's, (marked Taitsville on the map) near which place it forks, the left via Sizemore's ferry on the Alabama River to Jackson & St. Stephens, & the right to Claiborne; there is also a Road direct to Burnt Corn from Frazier's.â€”St. Stephens and Claiborne are connected with each other by good roads for a newly settled country, also with all the important points & Towns of Alabama. There is a very good road from St. Stephens, East of the Tombeckbee River, via Tuscaloosa and Huntsville, A. to Nashville in Tennessee. A Road, I understand, has been laid out from Tuscaloosa to Claiborne & which Is in part already opened. A Road North from Pensacola into Alabama would strike the River at Cahawba. This Road was laid out last Spring by the inhabitants of Alabama & of Florida. Running South from Cahawba it strikes the Escambia River at Beauman's ferry near the Territorial line. I am informed that the people of Alabama contemplate opening their end of this Road shortly, & the Floridians are endeavoring to raise a Sum by subscription sufficient to open their part.â€”The Settled parts of the State of Alabama are very generally connected with each other by tolerable Roads, & only require some to be cut for general purposes in doing which the aid of the Government will be at all necessary. The Road to Frazier's requires to be straitened & improved & the Road to Beauman's ferry also ought in my opinion to be opened. I estimate the expense of doing both at $4000,â€”that is, $2000 for each.â€” Pensacola, though possessing no importance at present in a commercial point of view, will gradually become a place of considerable export. There is a vast tract of fertile Country rapidly populating of which she is the natural place of deposit. The roads proposed to be opened are important in promoting the Settlement of the Territory, as well as highly important for military purposes. In a future maritime War, the advantages resulting from having a secure harbor for Wessels in the Gulf of Mexico, easy of ingress & egress, where they can not only be supported by a military force from the rear, but be abundantly supplied with provisions & water, will give to this City & Port their true character & Rank. All the Roads contemplated can be conveniently opened by the Troops on this station in a very few years with advantage to themselves and to the Government. Want of occupation is the bane of the military profession & the monotony of a Garrison life seldom fails to enervate the officer and destroy the efficiency of the Soldier.â€” I enclose for your inspection a map of Alabama"" published in August last & received a few days since from Philadelphia. I have sketched on it the Roads & trails spoken of in this letter. You will perceive that the trail is marked on it from Deer point towards St. Augustine;"" and also that which I recommended for the Mail Route from Fort Mitchell. Should the mail hereafter be established on this Route, I have to observe that it would also be more direct to Mobile than the Route the mail now travels to that city.â€” If I should happily succeed in laying out the Roads already ordered in such manner as to give satisfaction to the Department, I should be exceedingly gratified to be ordered to survey & lay out the Roads to Blakely & Mobile Point.â€â€” I have the honor to be Sir, with the most perfect respect, Y"" Mo.

I am extremely anxious to make a final settlement with the Department, in relation to the monies in my hands, and for that purpose enclose my accounts with the necessary vouchers. I also forward you an order for one quarter's salary which you will be so good as to apply to the discharge of any balance which may appear against me. The charge in favor of M"" M*Neil, who acted as Clerk, whilst the duties of Governor as well as those of Secretary of the Territory were performed by me during the absence of Governor Duval, I think perfectly correct, as it has heretofore been allowed in similar cases in this Territory.â€” The item charged for the disbursement of the public money, I view as reasonable and just. I do not believe, that it was contemplated by the Government, that I should incur the risk and responsibility of holding a large sum of public money in my hands, and making the disbursements with out some compensationâ€” Whatever balance may remain in my favor after settlement, you will oblige, by transmitting it to me, in the shape of a check on the Branch Bank at New Orleans.

Jacksons Council: The President of the United States, as communicated to me by the Hon' the Secretary of State has been pleased to direct that these Debts (and which principally arose during the prevelance of the fever of 1821) should be paid, and I can only state, that the accounts and certificates forwarded in April last, are all the vouchers which can be furnished at this time: I have no doubt but they will by the Secritary of State be deemed satisfactoryâ€”when the money is paid to the individual creditors, their receipts will be taken and forwarded to your Office, to shew that the money has been justly and truly disbursedâ€”The individuals who had claims on the former City Council, presented their accounts to them, and as there was no funds in the Treasury, their accounts were examined, the sums due stated, and a certificate given for the amount, to be paid when in funds; and an entry made on the Corporation booksâ€” Many of these certificates have been assigned, and passed into different handsâ€” I state these facts to shew, that it is not possible for the present corporation to furnish vouchers until they pay the moneyâ€ With much respect I remain Your obed"" Serv"" WATERS SMITH Mayor of the City of S*Augustine [Endorsed] Smith Waters S*Augustine 14 Oct 1823 R* 2 Nov",1823,October,14,1823-10-14,Mayors Office City of ST.

I shall probably be absent until about the middle of January and in the mean time shall not be able to furnish monthly summary statements &c as heretofore. So soon as I return I shall render my accounts for the 4"" Quarter in this year.â€â€” I have made such arrangements as I believe will ensure the regular supply of fuel, forage, Stationary &c, to the troops, during my absence.â€” Since the receipt of your letter on that subject I have endeavored to engage a competent clerk to leave my office in care of, but without success.â€”I have therefore retained Capt. Crupper in public employ while I am employed in the Survey of these Roads, trusting that when all circumstances are considered the amount thus disbursed will be allowed to my credit either on his receipt for the money or on a charge in my own name for the amount actually paid for clerk hire.â€” If your order directing me to make these surveys had also authorized me to suspend my duties here I should not have required a clerk for the time being, and after my return I could have made out for a while with any person who could write a good hand and was somewhat versed in accounts. But I was not relieved & moreover it would have been very difficult to have got any officer of the line now here to relieve me, so much reluctance exists among the officers to embarrassing themselves with public accounts in a staff appointment only temporary.â€”I am now accountable for all supplies that are purchased and delivered during my absence on contracts made by myself; and my own security, & the safety of those who signed my Bond, rendered it necessary for me to leave in charge of my office, a person who knew precisely what was allowed by Regulations, & who, out of personal friendship for me, would attend to getting the proper Returns & receipts & keep my papers in order; these considerations may be trifling to those who are not responsible but to me they all are importantâ€”accidents may happen to me in the Wilderness of Florida & my securities must not be troubled about any final settlement of my accounts.â€”This is the only instance in which I have ever departed from the strict letter of my orders, (and I viewed your letter as an order to discharge Capt. Crupper) but I have done what I thought was not only necessary for my own safety, but for the public interest. I know too well the difficulty of keeping property accounts square especially of forage & of fuel; and even if I should lose the amount thus paid for clerk hire, I shall at least have the satisfaction of being able to render my accounts on a final settlement without soliciting allowances for losses or deficiencies.â€” So far as it regards the legality of employing Captain Crupper it appears evident to me that when a Citizen, whose services cannot be coerced, as in the case of an Officer of the Government, is employed by a public agent that the fact of the Citizen's being indebted to the Government can be no bar to his receiving pay, provided the Agent was authorized to engage the person at all in such employment;-it would be optional with the Citizen to render those services or not, & no one would without a prospect of being paid.â€”In this particular instance I know Capt. Crupper to be wholly dependent upon his personal labor for support, and could not have engaged to remain here, even if he had wished to do so, without an assurance that he should be paid.â€”It may perhaps be asked why he does not seek employment elsewhere;â€”In reply to this I have only to say that he preferred remaining with me, (until the receipt of your order to discharge him,) to other employment although I paid him for his services less than the Commonest Store-clerk in the Country gets. Ease & leisure could have been no reason for his remaining here for I require more writing in the office by one half than is done by any Clerk at Washington, & living is much more expensive here than there.*â€” I am Sir with perfect respect Yr Mo.

The case appears to be a plain one, and he is generally considered as a very unworthy member of the military establishment. I also enclose the Treaty with the Florida Indians, with the Journal of the Commissioners and the letters of Gov"" DuVal, and Col. Gadsden.â€ The object of transmitting the papers at present is to obtain your decision on the proposition of the Governor to commence running the lines forthwith, and to take a military position on Tampe-Bay for the reasons which he has assigned. It certainly seems desirable on every account, that another year should not pass away without concentrating the Indians on the place proposed for their permanent home; and it is believed, that unless the lines should be run without delay it will be impossible to effect this desirable object. There is another reason for acceding to the request of the Governor. So little is known of the Country which has been fixed on for the Indians, that the Commissioners have been compelled to have the Northern limits of the tract, Subject to be altered hereafter, if it should appear, that there is not a sufficiency of good land in that which has been reserved. It seems to me desirable that the line Should be definitively fixed before the Treaty is ratified by the Senate, which may be done by running the line, and giving our Commissioners discretionary power for that purpose. The general information which will be acquired of the tract by runing the line, will not doubt be very Satisfactory to the Senate, when it comes to act on the Treaty. For these reasons, and as the expense will be Small, it seems to me that it would be proper to accede to the request of the Governor. I have no doubt, but that Col Gadsden, and Lieu"" Ripley* are well qualified for the duty of running the line. - I received your letter enclosing one from Gov"" Robertson' on the Subject of removing the troops from Baton Rouge. I can find no trace of the resolution of the Legislature of Louisiana, to which the Governor refers; nor have I any recollection of ever having Seen it.

I do not consider that measure, as interfering in the slightest manner, with the right, of the Senate, as to advice &cc, but as acquiring the necessary information to enable them to decide, with satisfaction to themselves, on the treaty.

You are accordingly authorized to make your arrangements to commence the survey as soon as practicable, associating Lieut: Ripley with you as your assistant.

The reservations if confirmed by the Senate, can be surveyed at any time there after. If, in making the survey of the tract assigned to the Indians, you should find that the northern line, as defined in the treaty, does not embrace a sufficiency of good land for the accommodation of the Indians, you are authorized to exercise a sound disretion and remove it farther north so as to include the necessary quantity.

Diligent enquiry has been made, and it does not appear, that there is a road between these places, on the route designated, on which the mail can be conveyâ€™d. There are Indian paths, which pass through different Indian Settlements, but none it is understood, that extend for any considerable distance on the proper direction. The want of a road, is not the only obstacle on this route. Almost the whole distance, is an unhabited Wilderness, except a few Indian Villages, and it is represented, that very large and impassable Swamps and lakes, will render the passage of the mail, in some places, impracticable. The lowest responsible bid that has been made for the conveyance of the mail on this route is four thousand dollars, & it is confidently believ'd, that the route will not add, two hundred dollars to the receipts of the department.

At the late Term of the District Court two Offenders were sentenced to two years imprisonment each, who could scarcely have been detained at all but for the courtesy of Col. George M.

[Enclosure 28] Presentment of the Grand Jury of the United States District Court in the Territory of West Florida NOVEMBER TERM, 1823. GRAND JURY ROOM The Grand Jury for the District of West Florida, for November term, 1823, holden at the City of Pensacola in said District, in conformity with their duty, make the following presentments. 1. The Grand Inquest for the District of West Florida would respectfully present as a great grievance, the present state of the public buildings in this District, the edifice in which the Court is held being ruinous and inadequate to its proper accommodation, and there being no departments for the public offices; but more especially the state of the public prisons, in this district, or rather the total want of them. Refused permission by Congress at their last session to levy taxes for this and other purposes, and unable (even if taxed) at this time, to produce any sufficient amount to effect essential objects; entirely without public prisons of any description, with a population too thinly distributed to enable the Marshal promptly to summon citizen's guards for the security of prisoners; situated thus, and lo- cated on the extremity of the continent, our District thus, most liable to be made the harbour of fugitives from justice, who here resort to commit crimes with impunity, it has become most peculiarly essential to the safety, prosperity and character of this district, that it should possess the means which safe public prisons afford, to restrain offenders and insure public justice and happiness. The Grand Inquest for this District would therefore respectfully, but most earnestly represent to the government of the United States through the Delegate from this territory, the necessity and importance of an early appropriation for the above objects. 2. The Grand Jury for the said District would also respectfully present as a grievance, the state of things in this District in relation to the payment of dues from the government, to the officers of Court and others in this District. In other districts in the United States, it is believed that the U. S. Marshal is always furnished in advance with competent funds to pay promptly all the expenditures incurred during the terms of the U. S. District Courts at the close of each sitting thereof; while in the District of West Florida, which, from its recent settlement by citizens of the United States, from the general character of its present country population, viz: an industrious class of small farmers, depending upon their own exertions for support; and lastly, from the extreme pressure of the times, and scarcity of a circulating medium in the District, PECULIARLY demands the course pursued in other districts; it has nevertheless been here, as yet WHOLLY neglected. It needs only to state, that actual disbursements by Jurors, Witnesses, Deputy Marshals, &c. while attending public business, upon the sittings of the U. S. District Courts at divers times for the last ten months, are still due and unpaid by the government, causing an extreme hardship to citizens who are compelled thus to leave their homes and employments, to attend to public business at their individual expense, a hardship and oppression which the government could never willingly inflict. The Grand Inquest would therefore in this mode respectfully represent this matter to the government through the delegate from the territory 3. The Grand Inquest would present as a matter of great public interest to the District, the subject of an internal navigation between the waters of the Apalachicola River, and the bays of St. Andrews and Pensacola. This line of inland navigation it is believed, from a partial examination already made, can be effected at an expence comparatively trivial, and would in its completion, ensure to the citizens of the respective portions of the District, very important advantages; the Grand Inquest would therefore recommend to their fellow citizens a continued attention to this object until it be accomplished. 4. The Grand Inquest presents the importance of such a modification of the existing laws of the U. S. relative to the adjustment of â€œclaims and titles to landâ€ in Florida, as may enable the Board of Commissioners in West Florida to effect a more speedy decision of the claims, and thus induce an earlier emigration to Florida; or in failure of obtaining such modification, to endeavor to effect a chauge of the said law, so far as to permit the immediate survey and sale of such public lands in West Florida, as are unembarrassed by claims, and the subject is recommended to the attention of the Delegate to Congress. 5. The Grand Inquest present the importance of a strict attention on the part of Justices of the Peace and other Magistrates to that part of the law enacted at the last session of the Legislative Council of Florida, respecting justices of the peace, which requires such officers duly to recognize, in order to their appearance at the court ensuing, all material witnesses in criminal cases, occurring before them, a duty hitherto much neglected by them, as, without a strict attention to this requirement of the said law, the Grand Inquest are unavoidably impeded in the transaction of their business. The Grand Inquest would request that a certified copy of the four first ensuing of these their public presentments may be forwarded by the United States Attorney for West Florida, to the Delegate from this Territory, to whose attention they are recommended, with the request, that he adopt all proper measures to effect speedily the object of the first and second of these presentments. The Grand Inquest further requests that a copy of these their public presentments, after being placed upon the records of the court, be ordered to be published in the next number of the public gazette of West Florida.

During my residence here for the last eight months not a fortnight has scarcely elapsed without the departure from this port of Wessels loaded with Cedar & Live-Oak timber believed by every ehe te be ett by every one to be cut upon the publick lands, nay in many instances known to be, but as the most respectable mercantile houses here engage in such shipmentsâ€”no one is willing to become Informerâ€”and the actual Trespassers always avoid coming in person to this Port.

As legal proofs upon which the U.S. Attorney would be authorized to libel the Wessel and Cargo, are Scarcely ever attainable in the first instance from the adroitness with which the matter is managed & the Shipments made, the only feasible method is to have them overhauled by a publick Wessel after clearance who would be authorized to detain them upon probable cause of suspicion, which it may be Safely asserted exists in regard to every one of 8 or 10 Wessels which have cleared from this Port with Timber during the last year and will continue to exist.â€”An Article upon this Subject which appeared lately in the Mobile paper and has I observe been copied into our Gazette hereâ€”which as it takes a very correct view (as is here thought) of the matter, and a view more at large than I am willing to adopt in this Communicationâ€”I have taken leave to transmit the Gazette alluded to.

S. District & Circuit Courts for West Florida has since been had in this District and the utmost exertion was made on the part of the U.S. to effect the conviction of three individuals who were charged with the â€œcutting & selling for transportation &c.â€â€”Several cargoes of Publick timber, red Cedar & live Oak, & who I have no doubt were justly chargedâ€”These persons were readily acquitted, owing to their precautionary measures & to the entire indifference in the Publick mind here on the Subject of this depredation. Like acquittals must be the result "" of like offences & trials here, until the Government shall adopt some more vigilant preventive measures under the Acts in relation to this Species of Publick property. While I have the honor to hold the office of U. S. Attorney no effort shall be wanting on the part of that officer to prevent or furnish offences of the kind in questionâ€”but there is little hope of Success (important as is the matter) under present circumstances. Applications are frequently made to be by actual Settlers upon the publick landsâ€”upon which there are heavy growths of fine ship timber, viz. of the Live-oak, red cedar, locust & Cypress. and who wish to Settle those lands, to clear and improve them,-in doing which the Trees are either girdled & left to decay or cut down and removed.â€” They ask of me information, whether the Government, would consent to purchase this Timber or enter into contracts to receive at Pensacola good Ship Timber necessarily destroyed or cut for the above reasons. Not being advised as to the course pursued hitherto by the Government, or the Naval Department in this matter, I have been unable to answer the proposed qweries. Should the power to make purchases of Timber under such circumstances be vested in the Naval department, & its exercise be deemed not to be impolitick I will venture to Suggest that if the location of a Naval Agent at this port be determined, his being vested with Such power, would conduce greatly to the preservation of the Publick Timber, not only by preventing its demolition but by Securing to the Government for the use of the Navy (at a cheap rate) large quantities of the most valuable Publick Timber, now entirely lost to it, and what is indeed worse, often exported to British ports. It is hoped by the Attorney that in these Suggestions he may not be thought to have overstepped the modesty of his dutyâ€”but if So, he trusts his mistake will be ascribed to an honest official zeal rather than to any intentional persecution.â€ I have the honor to be Sir Very respectfully Your obedient servant WILLIAM F STEELE Attorney of the U.S. &c. &c HON.

Such were my flattering anticipations and intentions but the unmerited persecution to which I have been subjected by the malevolence of the District Attorney Mr. Wm F. Steele has induced me to make an exposÃ© of the circumstances to the Governm"" of the U. States, and should they tolerate such proceedings and outrages the ancient inhabitants must seek security by an abandonment of their homes, and a refuge under their old Government. Sometime last Spring a rencounter took place between a Spanish Cadet, and an American Shopkeeper, in which I interposed and parted the Combatants. They were taken up, and I among the rest, and brought before a Justice of the Peace as rioters, and upon a full examination before [MS. torn] Justices I was discharged. M Steele arrived a few days afterwards, had another warrant taken out, and brought me before the Mayor and another Justice, and upon examination I was again discharged. At the next term of the Superior Court he moved to have a Bench Warrant issued against me, which was refused. At the term of the Court he sent up six Indictments successively against me which were all returned, â€œNot found.â€ Insatia.[ble] in his persecution he endeavoured again to have me bound over to answer at the next term of the Court which the Hon.â€ Judge refused, and at the late term of the Superior Court he had me again arrested, and sent before another Grand Jury four indictments for riot, assault, affray, trespass, &ca in a matter in which I only interposed as a peace-makerâ€”The Grand Jury however, at the first term indignantly returned some of those bills saying â€œthey had acted on the same subject,â€ and that this repetition was not calculated â€œto promote public Justice but to engender animosities in the community;â€ and the four last indictments were again returnedâ€”â€œNot found.â€ The two young gentlemen who were engaged in the fight have had as many as eighteen indictments sent up against them, and have been induced to believe that the Inquisition is a merciful Tribunal compared with an American Court in which such a man as W"" F. Steele officiates as Minister. I inclose a certificate of the clerk of the Court in support of these facts, and a Copy of the presentments against the Attorney himself at the last Court for drunkenness and other immoralities. I am aware, Sir, that it is not the Govern"", but its unworthy representative to whom blame can be imputed but such outrages have already driven many, and will soon drive many more from the Country unless he is removed. I have, therefore, humbly to request that you will be pleased to lay this letter with the accompanying documents before His Excellency the President of the United States, and receive the homage of respect with which I have the honour to subscribe myselfâ€” Your Excellencyâ€™s Obedient & humble Serv"" traducion HENRY DE GRAND-PRE THE HONOURABLE JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Secretary of State &c, &c.

We therefore beg leave to suggest the propriety of having some convenient and Safe Port in Florida, where all vessels that have wrecked goods on board shall deliver their cargoes; the owners, underwriters & wreckers can have their agents to attend to their interist; it will secure to the United States a considerable revenue, and to the underwriters their proportion of the property savedâ€”at present if a vessel is wrecked and the Cargo is saved by different wrecking Wessels each vessel takes in a cargo and proceeds to a port most convenient for the master, and every vessel might go to a different port, how then is the Captain who is a general agent for the underwriters able to attend to their interist; and perhaps it is not known to Him to what port the wrecking vessels are boundâ€”If some particular ports is disignated in which all wreck goods shall be deposited, the Captain can then remain, at the wreck until the last of His Cargo is shipped, and sure to find the property in the hands of the agent for the underwritersâ€”We therefore pray that your honourable body will disignate the Port of Fernandina (Amelia Island) as the Port of deposit for all wrecked goods that may be saved to the East of Cape Florida; and all vessels going on a wrecking voyage shall give bonds before they depart, to deliver all the wreck goods they may find on the coast of Florida in the said Port of Fernandina, and there to be sold agreeable to Lawâ€”The advantage that would arrise to this Territory and the United States will be greater; at present many of the wrecking vessels carry their wreck goods to Nassaw New Providence, by which the United States are deprived of the benefit that should arise from the wrecked property saved.â€” Your Memorialists submit with great respect to the consideration of your Honourable body the facts here in stated.

It is impossible to give specific instructions here for the execution of the treaty; and the Agent is therefore directed to consult with the Governor & yourself in the measures to be taken for that purpose.

Your request â€œthat some of the smaller armed vessels on the West India station may be directed to enter occasionally the Bay of Tampa & Charlotte Harborâ€ has been submitted to the Secretary of the Navy, who has replied that he would order commanders to comply with your wish.

The President has no power under the existing laws relating to the Indians, to authorize the erection of such a tribunal as you suggest, to try the right of property, to the negroes in question, between the Indians and our Citizens.

SIR It is with much pleasure I reply to your note of this morning, in the hope that a full explanation of our respective views of the course most adviseable for the Commission to pursue, may lead to the adoption of such regulations as will tend to facilitate the discharge of the important and delicate responsibilities, with which we are entrustedâ€” It is for this purpose I submit the following propositions and regulations Firstâ€”That the Secretary be directed to translate and record, the Royal Orders, the official correspondence, the regulations of the Governors and the Instructions and calculations controling the Surveyorsâ€” Secondâ€”That the Commission ascertain whether the Governors of East Florida possessed any authority to dispose of the Public lands independent of the Royal Orders and whether their regulations are to be considered the acts of the Spanish Government and as such to be respected in our adjudicationsâ€” Thirdâ€”That the Commission determine whether the Royal Order of 29* March 1815 authorizing Grants for Military Services be not controlled by that of the 29* October 1790 and what are the conditions refered to in the latter order Fourthâ€”That the Commission ascertain whether the Surveyors were authorised to change the location of Concessions at discretion and in the same manner to divide grants and locate the Several parts and whether they were not subject to certain regulations and the table of Percel explanatory of the Sameâ€” Fifthâ€”That the Commission determine whether they can enquire into the validity of the circumstances of a Grant, anticident to the issuing of the Royal Titles, where the concessions have been made within the authority of the Royal Ordersâ€” Sixthâ€”That the commission decide whether the abandonment of the Province by the British Subjects after its cession to Spain in 1783 did not by operation of the Treaty of Cession, re-attach their lands to the Royal Domainâ€” Seventhâ€”That the Commission enquire whether Grants containing the customary clause, â€œwithout injury to third persons,â€ were valid against the Spanish Government, if it should appear, that the lands petitioned for had been previously granted, without a Subsequent Decree and order to change the Locationâ€” Eighthâ€”That the Commission ascertain whether Decrees for pasturage and Mill Seats conveyed more than a permission to use the pasture and timber and whether the Government did not reserve the right to concede to others, all the plantable lands contained therinâ€” Ninthâ€”That the Commission determine whether lands abandoned for more than two years in Succession were not considered vacant lands reverting to the Royal Domain, the Grantee continuing to reside in the province, and whether if so, the effect of such an abandonment can accrue to the benefit of the United States, when the absence of the claimant was an incidental consequence of the rebellion of 1812â€“ The propriety of establishing these preliminary principles will, I am confident, appear to you necessary upon mature reflectionâ€”Without Settling some general law, it will be impossible for the Commission to do justice to the claimants and perform their duty to the United Statesâ€”The Means of diciding are in the possession of the Commissioners for which the United States are principally indebted to the detention of the Public Documents from Governor Coppinger by the order of General Andrew Jacksonâ€” I again offer for the consideration of the Commission, regulations, the utility of which if candidly examined, cannot fail to meet its concurrence, the more especially as the embarrassment of our present proceedings, practically teach the necessity of resorting to some change 1* Regulation That the Secretary be directed to prepare a discriptive list of the Claims, according to the form presented by me and adopted by the Commissionâ€” 2 Regulation That the Secretary be directed to Class the claims under the respective Royal Orders on which they are predicated and that the Commission proceed to the examination and adjudication of the claims in classesâ€” -

That the Commission will retain through the whole course of the examination of witnesses a Supervisory control, that immiterial and illegal evidence be not recordedâ€” 8"" Regulation That it will no longer be the duty of the Secretary to make out Memorials or prepare commissions for the examinations of witnessesâ€” 7Â° Regulation 6 is not included. 9* Regulations That the Secretary will hereafter confine his written translations to material parts of Spanish Documents and in all cases, within the final jurisdiction of the Commission, having Royal titles, the attendance of the Secretary will only be required to give parol translationsâ€” 10"" Regulation That in all cases where there are Royal Titles, the fees for recording will only be charged on the Memorial and Royal Title, but in all cases on condition, Seeking confirmation fees will be charged on Such records as the commission shall determine essential to the establishment of the claim, when directed to be recordedâ€” I have been thus particular to avoid the usual misunderstandings incident to the irregular manner in which our proceedings have been minuted and more illegally kept in loose Sheets and I anticipate that you will no longer indulge in so disingenuous an interpretation of my motives, as to imagine that I would attempt to expose the regulations of the commission by the introduction in a disguised form of a practical illustration of their injurious inexpediencyâ€”It is impossible that the Commission can investigate the claims with advantage, if they are to be taken into consideration, without any other System than the order in which they have been enterredâ€”I am confident when you have deliberated upon these propositions and regulations you will be convinced of the propriety of their adoption, the more especially if you reflect upon the embarrassments that now procrastinate our examination and that for all useful purposes the business of the commission is now essentially Suspendedâ€”I appeal to your candour to acknowledge, whether I have not repeatedly anticipated our present difficulties, as the necessary consequences of the decisions of the Commission and whether your recent anxiety to have perfected the discriptive list submitted by me, might not be considered as conclusive evidenceâ€” I am aware, in some instances arising from the unfortunate indulgence of the Commission in permitting claims to be filed not corresponding with our regulations of the 1* August last, that the memorials present but an imperfect statement of the claim, which, may however be Supplied by a little extra attention on the part of the commissioners in collating from the testimony a brief analysis, or by directing the claimants to file supplementary memorialsâ€” It is with much pleasure I avail myself of your admission that â€œthe time when we must make report to Congress will shortly elapseâ€ to renew the proposition, to report immediately to the Secretary of the Treasury the acts and proceedings of the commissioners and in as much as we have done little more than to order the claims to be filed (none of which have been recorded) that we suggest the propriety of an indefinite extension of our Session, if our Secretary is to translate and record all the testimony and that further time be allowed for the admission of the numerous claims that remain to be presented I am perfectly willing â€œto take all the claims now in readiness into consideration,â€ which state of preparation, according to the decisions of the majority of the Commission will place under our consideration only, thirty seven claims, of which eleven are not within our final jurisdiction notwithstanding we have a Secretary authorized by law, and by two assistants appointed by the Commissionâ€” The following decisions I have uniformly opposed and in my estimation they ought to be reported to Congress The majority of the Commission have decided that all documents presented shall be recorded in extenso and those in Spanish be translated by the Secretaryâ€”Thus giving an employment to the Secretary of an indefinite termination and in as much as the mesne conveyances are of indifference to the United States and as Congress has reserved no right to revise our proceedings, within our final powers, there can be no necessity to record the evidence in cases of confirmation as

without Schedule or discriptive list and that the letter from Governor Kindelan, the foundation of the Royal Order of 1815 has been essentially altered and that transcripts of different import have been funishedâ€”The advertisement of the keeper of the Public Archives also make known to the Commission, that a small Grant has been withdrawn from the office and one of 16,000 acres Substitutedâ€”

The enclosed letter of Sam"" Myers Esqr"" (formerly of Norfolk) that during the time that he acted as Deputy Collector, the fees and emoluments averaged about fifteen dollars a month, barely sufficient as he very correctly states to defray the expences of printing stationary and fuel, which the collector has himself to furnish.

I can further remark that there are few places which present greater facilities for the violation of the revenue laws, and where active and vigilant officers are more required. Under these circumstances I feel convinced that you will consider it just to allow the collector a reasonable compensation, and that the salary should commence at the time the compensation allowed by the President under the â€œact for taking possession of the Floridasâ€ ceased.

I have received orders from the President of the United States, of the most decisive character, to arrest all persons who may attempt to cut timber on the lands claimed by the Government. In order that I may promptly execute this mandate of the Government I am specially empowered to call on, any commanding officer either of the military or naval department stationed in or on the Coast of Florida for such aid and assistance as I may deem necessary for this object. I therefore request, Sir, that on your arrival at Tampa Bay you will send a detachment to Charlotte Harbor and arrest all persons, that may be engaged in cutting timber at that place, or any other on that coast, and by the first conveyance have them sent to Pensacola. The Government does not admit or recognize any claims to land in that part of Florida as belonging to individuals, and if any such are pretended legally to exist the persons claiming the same must obtain first a confirmation of their grants before they will be permitted to Cut the Timber. If any individual who may set up a claim to land (not admitted by the United States) was at liberty to dispose of the Timber, it is obvious that a pretext would never be wanting on his part to despoil the lands belonging to the United States of the valuable Timber.â€ With sentiments of high regard and esteem, I am Your ob"" Servant.

A flat was built by the order of Colonel Brooke & transported thither in pieces, requiring but a few hours after their arrival to put it together & land the public propertyâ€”two large & good Boats were also taken by the command. Three months supply of provisions was also shipped on board the vessels. The vessels were fully laden & in addition to her cargo of Stores, the mules were carried on the deck of the Shields.

She might last for a year or two yet in the Lake navigation, where in Stormy weather a harbor could be made at all times; but between this and Tampa there is no harbor East of the Appalachicola & that is north of the direct course; besides she is too small, her cargo is less than 200 Barrels & she is sailed at the same expense of one carrying 450 Barrels. I can purchase a Schooner, built last Summer expressly for the coasting trade in the Gulf & now at Mobile, for $.4000, carrying about 450 Barrels. She is copper fastened & it would cost about $.500 to have her coppered, a measure essential to her preservation from the worms in this Bay.â€”If she had been owned by the United States it would have cost the Government about $.350 to have transported the Company of Artillery from St. Marks to this place, & a load of Stores to Tampa Bay whereas I shall now pay $.1400 to the owner of the Shields for the same service.â€” If the vessel alluded to had been in this port when I last chartered the Shields, I should have purchased her for the public service & trusted to you for an approval of the purchase.â€” It is probable however that hereafter I shall be able to charter vessels on terms somewhat more reasonable than I have engaged the Shields for this voyage, but even that depends much upon the convenience of getting up the Bay & the facility of landing their Cargoes.â€ I have the honor to be Sir, With perfect respect Yr Mo.

Should it be determined to resume the works, at Dauphin Island, it would be advisable to complete the Quarters without delay, whereby the work already done to them, which might otherwise be lost, would be saved and a respectable temporary defence would be securedâ€” the Quarters by there peculiar construction, being calculated to serve as a Citadel or Reduit to the main Work. In this state the work would remain without injury should the means applicable to the fortifications on the Gulf of Mexico be limitted and their application to the works intended to guard the avenues to New Orleans be deemed of paramount importanceâ€”In that case it would be advisable, in addition to the Quarters or Citadel to finish the Salient Place of Arms, opposite the channel, which would be attended with but inconsiderable additional expense, and would admit of being established as a Battery for the temporary defence of the Channel, while it would itself be commanded and protected by the Citadel. â€œThe Plan now pursued in the prosecution of the works at Mobile Pointâ€ viz an officer of Engineers having them committed to his direction, and being held responsible for their faithfull execution, is that pursued at all the other works under construction, with the exception of those at Rigolets and Chef Menteur, and is believed to be the most oeconomical and efficient.

Hunter, our present Secretary, as a suitable person to fill the vacancy in this Board of Commissioners. Upon conversing with M. Hunter upon the subject, he appears to be entirely satisfied with his present situation, and prefers withdrawing his pretentions to the appointment proposed. Feeling the necessity of having the vacancy filled, we have, under these circumstances, taken the liberty of recommending Colo. John Miller of this place, to the attention of the President. We can testify to his honesty and intelligence, and have evry assurance, that he would harmonize with the present members of the Board, as well as inspire general confidence.â€” The necessity of filling the existing vacancy in the Board, is suggested by the consideration, that it is now rendered probable, that we shall not be enabled to complete the duties of the Commission at as early a period as was some time since anticipated. Additional claims have been submitted for adjudication, and others will, no doubt, be filed as soon as it is known that our term is prolonged. Besides, it is possible that cases might be presented, upon which the present members of the Board should differ in opinion; in which event, we could only report the claims for the decision of Congress. Upon a consideration of all the circumstances connected with the subject, we are satisfied ourselves, of the necessity of making the proposed appointment. It would, alternately, give some relief to the present members of the Board, provide a remedy for any division of opinion, and inspire additional confidence in our decisions, all which, however, is respectfully submitted.â€” With evry sentiment of respect and esteem, we have the honor to be Y mo obt.

Hackley, who pretends to claim a part of the Duke of Alagon's Grant, is the person who has sent hands from the North to Tampa Bay for the purpose of cutting Timber.â€ Much of the valuable timber on the Chocktawhache River has already been pillaged. I lately descended this River 50 or 60 miles, and observed that every Cedar tree near the river side had been cut and carried away within a year or two past. In passing through the interior of Florida I had an opportunity of examining particularly the Country. The interior is, in my opinion, the most valuable Southern Country I have ever seen. Between the Suwannee and Apalachicola Rivers I estimate the good land at 1200000 acres. This region produces Sugar Cane and Sea Island Cotton in greater perfection than any other part of the Southern Country. The lands are uncommonly rich, and finely watered. The face of the Country is generally rolling, and in some parts mountainous. I have no doubt that this tract of Country alone will sell for more than the Florida Debt. There are no private Grants in this quarter, except the grant to Forbes & Co.; nine tenths of which is as poor as any lands in Florida. From the view which I have had of Florida I state, without the fear of contradiction, that there is more good land in Florida than is to be found in Louisiana.

"NA:WD, QMG, Letters Recd.: ALS",Correspondence,DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,DANIEL E. BURCH,THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,"GENERAL, Believing that too long a time will elapse before my returns for the current Quarter can be completed and forwarded, for me afterwards to survey and mark out the road to Fort Mitchell, as directed in your order of 11* September last,â€ for you to receive my report in time to obtain an appropriation for opening it, if that is intended, I have deemed it most proper for me to state at Once such facts respecting it as I know, and shall postpone the survey until I again hear from you on the subject. I am fully aware of the necessity of implicit obedience to the orders of a Superior in rank; and in this case should not have ventured thus long to delay this duty, but since my return from St. Augustine I could not possibly have performed it without wholly neglecting my other duties. Having travelled over more than half of this route directly along the trail, and crossed it at various other points, I am perfectly acquainted with the Country through which it must pass, and, moreover, believe myself to be as well qualified to make a correct estimate of the expense, and also to open it, if required, as if I had previously surveyed and marked it out.â€”Two Routes present themselves from Pensacola, first, via Fort Crawford up the west side of the Conecuh River, crossing it at â€œSchurlock's ferry,â€ (12 miles from the Fort,) and Second, to cross the Head of the Escambia Bay at Florida, (Beeler's ferry,) and thence up the Pensacola Path. Both these routes would unite, East of the Conecuh, about five miles from Schurlock's ferry. The first mentioned route is perhaps from 5 to 10 miles farther than the second; but nevertheless, is, I think, decidedly to be preferred, because of the difficulty of the wide Ferry at the head of the Bay:â€” If the road to St. Augustine had crossed at the Head of the Bay, the junction of the two roads at this point would have caused a good ferry to be kept up, which cannot now be expected Both of these routes are now tolerably good waggon Roads, (as good, if not better, than the mail road from this to Claiborne,) for the distance of one hundred miles. There is a waggon Road also from Fort Mitchell along this route for 25 or 30 miles, when it turns off to the right into the Settlements lying between the Conecuh and the â€œFederal Roadâ€, leaving only about 50 miles which is not already travelled by wagons. There are settlements along the road or trail for 100 miles from Pensacola, after which there are no more immediately upon the trail until within five miles of Fort Mitchell, at the Uchee Bridge, where it ought to intersect the Federal Road. The distance from Pensacola, via Claiborne, to Fort Mitchell is about 290 miles, & by the proposed direct route will not exceed 180 miles. There will be a Bridge over each to build at the Burnt corn creek, & murder Creek, (near Fort Crawford,) and also three Small Bridges over the head Branches of Pea River. The whole of this route is uninterrupted by Swamps, or any Streams of size excepting the Conecuh River; and is from Schurlock's Ferry a high pine ridgeway, being the dividing ridge between the waters of Yellow water & Pea River on the East and the Conecuh on the West. A good Road can be completed on this route in almost the same time that it would take to survey and mark it out; and I am of opinion that if a detail of one Lieutenant, one Sergeant, two Corporals & 24 men from the 4* Inf: was placed under my orders for the purpose I could open it in the early part of the Summer, without any detriment to their health, as the whole route is a dry pine barren; and also without adding any material burden to the general expenses of the Quarter Master's department at this Station. I have on hand 3 Yoke of oxen which are not now necessary for the public service here, as I can more than supply Teams in their Stead by the mules purchased last fall for the Survey; and I calculate upon retaining both oxen & mules in service in any event,- unless otherwise ordered,â€”as they will be indispensably necessary in working upon the road to St. Augustine, and it is difficult to purchase well-broke oxen & mules. I estimate the expense of opening this Road at $.2130,â€”for Extra pay to Soldiers, and the transportation of provisions & forage; and $.300 for the purchase of two waggons. The cost of the forage could hardly be considered as an extra expense, as it must be provided for the public cattle if unemployed; and I should use them for the principal part of the transportation and other work on the Road.""â€” I have the honor to be Sir, with, perfect respect Yr Mo.

These indictments were again quashed for informality by the County Court. I now enclose Your Excellency several Affidavits going to support the charges heretofore forwarded, and a number of others. It may be proper to remark, that however gross or improper may be the conduct of an Officer, the Community unless outraged in the extreme feel reluctant in preferring charges or giving affidavits.

It is calculated to produce a very unfavorable impression against me in the minds of those who are unacquainted with the facts.

Feeling conscious of my innocence, I should not have troubled you with the matter, as I am satisfied you must have been already much importuned by the petty dissentions which have unfortunately prevailed here, but that M Steel, has, I, understand, circulated a report that the presentments thus said to have been withheld by me, form the groundwork of charges against him on account of his official conduct. Under these circumstances I consider it my duty to give an explanation. From the moment M Steel commenced his official carreer at this place, he unfortunately gave much dissatisfaction to almost every one in any way connected with him. It is impossible for me to give an account of his strange, and unaccountable deportment. I possess neither inclination, nor skill to trace the picture; suffice it say, that in spight of every disposition to be indulgent to him, first on the score of his being a stranger, and next as holding a respectable commission, it became my duty to reprimand him at almost every moment, and at length with some severty in the case of Reily. In this case, after urging his motions in a most unbecoming manner, when I decided against him verbally, he insisted upon my reducing my decision to writing; and in complying with this request, I took occasion to express my disapprobation of his conduct, in the hope that it would produce a salutary effect; and on this occasion, having said that he meant no disrespect to the court or to the Grand Jury, I observed, that if that were the case, I should not give my opinion to the Clerk to be filed with the papers in the cause; but he declined observing that he wished to address something in writing. His refusal to accept of this offer to consign the matter to oblivion, by striking out of my opinion the part of it which censured him, satisfied me that his temper was perverse and obstinate. I of course declined receiving anything from him writing; and greatly to my astonishment, I afterwards saw in the newspaper, a paper which purported to be one that had been communicated to me, containing a most unfair account of the preceeding transaction, at the same time reflecting upon the conduct of the Grand Jury, and of a Mr Williams a member of the bar,"" to all of whom, as well as to myself, he was an entire stranger. From that time, until the last September court, publications frequently appeared, in which the conduct of many of the most respectable persons was implicated. These were well known to be the productions of M. Steel. With the exception of a very small number of persons, the community was much displeased, and when the Grand Jury, at the last mentioned term came into court and were asked whether they had any further business, and answering in the negative, were about to be discharged, they observed that they had still something before them of a general nature. After having retired about an hour, they returned, and the forman presented me sealed paper with my address, and opening it I found it consisted of something like an address to me, of a complimentary character, and a vindication of the former Grand Jury and myself from the newspaper publications before mentioned. M Steel ensisted, in a very rude and indecorous manner, upon seing the paperâ€”I stated to him that it had nothing to do with his official duties, and when he ensisted again, in the afternoon upon my delivering the paper to him, I stated to him what it contained, and told him that in the score of delicacy, if for no other reason, it did not become me to give publicity to such a document he still ensisted, when the explanation ought to have satisfied any one, and nothing was left to me but to punish him for his improper conduct, or to order him peremptorily to be silent. I chose the latter, particularly as he was then in a situation, in which unfortunately, he has been too often seen, and which did not allow him that calm exercise of discretion which he might possess on other occasions. I most unfair account of the transaction is contained in the pretended report, to which I have alluded in the commencement of this letter, which has only appeared six months after it took place, and when it might have been supposed that the presentment, was thrown away by me or lost. But it remained in my possession, and very reluctantly I have been compelled in my own defense to publish it. At the time,â€”I spoke to the forman and some of the Grand Jury individually, and told them I disapproved of it, and desired that it might not be published, as it would do more harm than good. Besides it might very naturally be said that I had been instrumetal in procuring such a paper, to sustain myself against those who were displeased by my conduct. Indeed when the document shall be exhited, the reasons for the course I pursued will suggest themselves most obviously. I have no intention to add any weight to the complaints made against M. Steel by individuals. I have nothing to do with them. What I have done has been to enclose the letters, or representations of M. Scott, to me as the Judge of the Superior Court;"" and to add 77 John Lee Williams. my opinion respecting the official conduct of M. Steel, and his want of capacity. This opinion has been confirmed by every thing which has come under my observation since. With the motives of M. Scott at the time I had nothing to do. M. Scott had been his client, and very shortly before this they had quarrelled about the compensation demanded by M. Steel for his services; and a suit was instututed before me, but dismissed. I viewed M. Scott merely as the agent of the government, as the deputy collector, and the fact which he stated in his communication alone induced me to notice it. I consider it due to truth to say, and I hope the observation may not be deemed improper, the conduct of neither of these persons has been such as to receive the esteem of the community in which they live; and in my own opinion the Attorney is not the worst man of the two, for, very often I am unable to find a motive even in the most mischeveus and vexatious of his acts, but rather some strange calenture of the intellect. I am informed that M. Steel has ascribed his misfortunes here, in part to some supposed enmity entertained by me against him. Such a feeling I disclaim, the imputation has even induced me to err by extending to him on many occasions, an indulgence which under other circumstances, would be scarcely warranted. A county court was lately held by Judge Bowie, in which according to the territorial law, M. Steel is also prosecutor, and his conduct was much more severely censured by that judge, than it ever had been by me. This was a common remark. The existence of unfriendly feelings on my part towards him, is certainly, in itself highly improbable unless excited by something offensive in his own conduct. But this will not account for his variance with so many individuals upon so many occasions, and I am informed that in Georgia where he formerly resided, his situation was no less unfortunate than it has been here. I could feel for him, if I could but see him feel for himself; and I really feel on account of his family and connections who are highly respectable, and who I fear are unhappily doomed to see a most lamentable termination to the carreer of this young man.â€ I am, Sir, with sentiments of respect Your most obed S' H: M: BRACKENRIDGE HON: J.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, XI:ALS",Correspondence,WILLIAM F. STEELE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,WILLIAM F. STEELE,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR By the mail of the preceding week * I had the honor to inform you that I had received a communication from Gen Call the Delegate to Congress from this Territory which apprised me of the fact of several charges having been preferred at the Department of State, against me for my official conduct,â€ & I then stated that I would endeavor to forward a proper despatch on the subject by the succeeding mail.â€ I proceed Sir to perform that duty with the hope that its result may prove to the Government not only that I am undeserving such an attack upon me as that which has been essayed, but that my destruction has been wantonly attempted by a combination of persons, some of whom, (if the suppositions of the publick here as to the individuals be correct) should have been by their stations, if not feelings far, far aloof from such a proceeding.â€”That the attempt has begun & progressed in the most extreme malice is here well known by my most respectable fellow citizens & that the wish for my removal exists only in the bosoms of a few illiberal designing interested or unprincipled men (within the limits of this city) I may with perfect safety declare to be the truth of the matter.â€”The single fact that until the charges were heard of from Washington, no respectable, impartial or independent citizen here knew of the charges or the application for my removal, that the publick were totally ignorant of the attempt must alone stamp the application with a most suspicious aspect, I trust Sir that the time has not yet arrived or ever will come when the secret machinations of a few invidious, illiberal or unjust men, (whether citizens or officers) can in the United States effected the removal of an officer who has sought to discharge his duty with stern impartiality, & who possesses the confidence of the worthier part of the community. This last phrase Sir it is conceded, (as being spoken of myself) were inexcusable in any man save one upon his defence and thus wantonly assailed & who has been gratified by the cordial assurances of many of his fellow citizens to the above effect. I shall endeavor Sir so far as my ignorance of my individual assailants at Washington & the vague nature of some of the charges will permit, to make such an exposition of the incidents of my official career as may be satisfactory & as may be (what I trust it will appear) a sufficient vindication. A few remarks Sir by way of explanation are necessary ere I advert specially to the points with which the Delegate has possessed me. On my arrival at this place in the early part of the last year, I found upon observing the state of society that the mass of the population of this city & its neighborhood, (being French & Spanish) & of those not many of the higher order) entertained all those crude indefinite notions of American laws, and institutions, which characterized the people of Louisiana upon its first acquisition by the U States. Seldom interfered with by the Spanish government for any, save political offences, or if noticed received an award of summary (& not often severe) justice by the mandate of a Governor or escaping with impunity the denunciations of their laws through the connivance of officers; the change of the government was to them an immense one as to the laws. In consequence (as might have been anticipated) when an offender was arrested and with all the deliberation known to our laws (to a stranger so unpleasing, unusual, & so apparently unnecessary, was held to answer for an offenceâ€”which might have been before deemed venial, or have been readily compounded, it was regarded as oppression, & the mass of the foreign or rather the adopted population considered themselves aggrieved individually as well as collectively. This state of things rendered the officer of the law who was the necessary medium of its operation almost inevitably unpopular with those who from their education or the want of it, comprehended not his duties or who by their defaults had subjected themselves to prosecutions.â€”Again Sir the depredations committed upon the publick domain by the destruction of its timber made it necessary for the Attorney to take some active measures by the seizure of a vessel and cargo in one instance, & the prosecutions of trespassers in person in another, which added to the former feeling among that portion of the community who had ere this proceeded without hindrance in their destruction of the publick property. Again as to the selections of Grand Juries by the Marshal from the only two classes from which he thought proper to obtain themâ€”First those of the city, adopted citizens of the Union, foreigners by birth, education & feeling, in almost every instance, or on the other hand from the class of population located upon the abandoned Spanish grants, or the unsurveyed publick lands in the upper parts of the County in which this City stands.â€” The former, unfitted by the prejudices of education, & the latter (the usual class of settlers on publick lands) having (with scarcely an excep- 301867-57â€“56 tion) never had the honor to serve upon a Grand Inquest in the States of the Union from which they had migrated, and being alike unacquainted with the duties of a Grand Juror, or the laws by which those bodies are governed. Among both these classes however, were a few respectable impartial, intellegent Americans, & adopted citizens who were proper Jurors, who yet were so seldom summoned & then in so small a number that their weight was never felt in that body & this result proceeding from the neglect of the Marshall to summon from the different parts of the District, as prescribed by law, so as to secure impartial proceedings, but taken to suit his convenience from the particular county of his residence, & sometimes from the Town of Pensacola itself, as for instance the Grand Jury at the May Term 1823 of the US Supâ€ Court for W Florida (of which body John Innerarity was appointed the Foreman by the Court) which Jury was composed of citizens or persons from within the limits of the city of Pensacola, with one individual exception; and then the expression of a Grand Jury thus selected, is attempted to be passed upon the publick, and the Government as a Grand Jury of the District of West Florida speaking the language of the hearts of the people of that District : a course which cannot but excite great surprise. Last but not least Sir in addition to the general causes of which I have spoken, & which would have affected any individual holding the office of US Attorney for this District, there was yet another cause which of itself might well have produced a most harsh feeling upon the publick mind in relation to the present incumbent of that office, upon whom the before named general influences were acting. This Sir was nothing more or less than the settled and determined hostility of the highest Judicial officer in the District, the Judge of the highest Court in which that incumbent acted as prosecutor, & this enmity encountered upon all occasions in court, & out of court, originating without cause & progressing without reason, except indeed sufficient reason were found in the opposition made (in discharge of his duty) by that officer to the decisions of that Judge, in cases where they were deemed not to be supported by the laws. With this unqualified & decided censure of a high officer of the Bench, it would not therefore have been a matter to excite surprise, if the publick disapprobation were indeed lavishly bestowed upon the U S Attorney, but even with all these operating causes in aid, the object has not been attained, & the prejudices existing against the Attorney exist (happily) only in this city, & among a comparative few, & the Attorney appeals with confidence to the feelings existing among the most respectable Americans of the country, as well as the more enlightened & worthy of the adopted citizens to prove the approbation and respect in which he stands with the community. If he could have condescended to solicit from the Grand Jury at the late November Term their presentment in favor of his official conduct, asserting their belief of his uprightness & integrity of official deportment, it would have been readily procured by him, & have enabled him to thwart the secret designs of his secret enemies, who succeeded by positive misrepresentation to deceive that Grand Jury into the finding of a presentment which was entirely groundless, & which yet was never for a moment intended by that body to indicate an ill opinion of the general conduct or character of the Attorney.â€”Yet Sir in reference to this last fact, it is not intended in this place, to enter into a series of elaborate proofs on this occasion, to establish the position that the present Attorney of the U States for West Florida, is a temperate, moral, or virtuous man and not wholly [MS. illegible]. If the representations of nearly all the Senatorial & Representative Members of Congress from two States New Jersey & Georgia, of the highest Judiciary officers, and nearly all the Legislative Body of the latter State, together with the special expressions of confidence in him made by some, nay numbers of the most worthy & distinguished among the citizens of that State, after an acquaintance of years; if all these testimonials (which it is presumed are to be found in the archives of the Department of State of the US) have been insufficient to establish the positions taken in the said documents it would seem the height of folly to seek on this occasion the evidence of a few gentlemen here by whom the Atty has been known for a few months. And indeed Sir upon reflection it becomes to the writer a matter of surprise, when considering his official course in Florida, that with the influence of the Judge and other official gentlemen, (exerted upon all occasions), added to his uniform strictness with offenders which have produced such high prejudices with a particular class; it is a matter of surprise that (with these conjoined causes moving), a presentment of a Grand Jury has not been obtained against the publick Attorney which might vie in mildness & justice with the opinion of the court in the case of Reilly. I trust Sir I shall be excused for this prolixity of prefatory remark, since it became necessary in order that the President should fully understand the proceedings hereafter alluded to in this defence.â€” To assume then the order adopted by Genl Call in his communication to me, I will in the first place, remark Sir on the case of the Thos Shields for a violation of the laws of the U States regulating the transportation of slaves.â€”In this case upon the application of the collector Mr Scott, to request me to proceed on the part of the U States, I had not then, nor have ever intended, to express the idea that in cases of pecuniary forfeitures under a statute, where qui tam actionsâ€ are given (as in the case in question) that the U States could not proceed alone for the penalty, by an information filed in the usual way; I intended not so to express myself in answer to the collector's note tho' I find that the haste with which that answer was written (by casualty) led me into a style of looseness of phrase & general expression which may very fairly bear such a construction. The intended meaning of the doubt therein expressed whether the Coll"" or rather â€œAttorney could sue officiallyâ€ was merely under the existing circumstances of that case which had been fully understood by the collector & myself in conference that morning, but for which my note would note would not have been so little explicit.â€”The state of facts understood between the Collectorâ€”& myself was firstly that no offence had been intended, if one had really been committed, secondly that it was made fully to appear to us or at all events to the Attorney & was afterwards fully shewn to the Coll"" by the testimony of Mr Davison whose affidavit is transmitted (Document No 1) that the Inspector of the Customs had actually given verbal permission to land the negros, & that they had been regularly cleared from New Orleans, the manifest and permits there being full & regular, & that the slaves were & had been from the period of their landing under the verbal permit aforesaid, in readiness to attend the Collector & to comply with the law formally, which he however declined. Under all these circumstances, believing that no offence whatever was committed, and knowing that a qui tam action could be filed in the case by any other person equally well as by himselfâ€”the Attorney deemed it competent for him to exercise a legal discretion in declining to take an official proceeding in behalf of the U States alone, in a case where he believed the spirit of the law had been complied with. The Attorney deemed it at all events quite competent for him (â€œwithout seeking to assume the judicial garbâ€) to decline taking such official proceeding in a case, in its nature so highly penal, until some legal evidence of the commission of the offence was before him by affidavit &c, which however was never offered in the case. It was believed that the mere official notice of any functionary (however respectable) was not a sufficient ground for the procedure under the circumstances.â€”The state of facts above recited (& which but for a full conversation between the Coll & Attorney which had just preceded) would have appeared in the note of the Coll & Attorneyâ€”present the case simply thus that as Attorney of the U States he intended to be understood to declare that he declined filing an information in the particular case in question for the U States alone, & under the special circumstances, until evidence laid before him, should have made it an imperious duty. Perhaps however the opinion was incorrect & that the official note of the collector was sufficient to compel or justify the taking an official procedure; if so I must regret the error but trust that a wrong apprehension of my discretionary power to the extent spoken of in the filing prosecutions of this nature, may not be considered as an overwhelming fault. I must ask here to be permitted to remark that if every official suggestion made to me by an officerâ€” stating the commission of an offence shall justify my official act in the institution of suits of this nature, I should from the not unfrequent intimations of this kind (had I always acted upon them) have produced against myself a charge of official tyranny vastly more well grounded than the one of this nature already preferred. As respects the execrable traffic which the law was intended to prevent I trust that as an American I need hardly say that no man feels more disposed to witness its extinction & aid in that objectâ€”Next Sir as to the Judge's â€œOpinionâ€ in the case of the U S vs Riley, I beg leave to refer to the affidavit (Document NÂ° 2) of Co! William Barnett, in time past a Member of Congress from the State of Georgia & one of the leading republicans of his day in that State, a man of Roman firmness and more than Roman virtue.â€”The affidavit proves distinctly that ere the Attorney had been in the Territory one short month (having arrived in April) and before his becoming more than passingly acquainted with Judge Brackenridge or had appeared in his court as a publick officer that his hostility (which I was to feel so heavily) had commenced & in a way too the most ungenerous & cruel, & that it still exists bitterly (as the enclosed affidavit (NÂ° 3 with NÂ° 13 in contrast) will shew) is here well understood. That this enmity has been increased by my earnest opposition to many of the decisions of the Judge illegal as the one now forwarded (par exemple) is more than probable, but the manner of that opposition has been ever guided by principles of law and of courtesy,"" and has never furnished him with the shadow of excuse. As to the opinion of the Court I can only say that it was pronounced in high passion, and appeared to be intended as a declamation at the time, since the Judge upon the Protest entered by the U. S. Attorney as to the Statement of facts, and the most unmerited abuse contained therein did immediately offer to withdraw the opinion if the Attorney would make an apology; to which it was replied that no apology could be given, where there was nothing to atone for, but that an answer would be filed, or handed to the Bench, which it was hoped might cause the very unjust opinion to be withdrawn: the Judge assented, & afterwards received the answer then refused to read it, or to withdraw the opinion which opinion was placed on file, tho never upon the Records of the Court. The answerâ€” the copy of which is herewith transmitted (document NÂ°4) is deposited in the office of the Clerkâ€”It contains the law as the Attorney believed it to exist in Florida, there being no restricting Statute as in some of the States of the Union. The paper (NÂ° 5.) containing the Oath, * From this point this document is written in a hand other than Steele's,  Warrant & recognizance are forwarded & it is only regretted that the absence of Col. Humphreys prevents my obtaining his affidavit to prove the facts connected with the immediate delivery of the opinion, & the offer to receive an apology, & which shall at some future Period be transmitted.â€”I may perhaps properly state here that Reily sold the horses the next day after his discharge, to some Citizens in the Presence & within in the knowledge of the Judge.â€” In regard Sir to my official conduct as the Publick prosecutor (to which Gen Call next alludes as a charge) I can only say that I have in conformity to the best dictates of my Judgment, & convictions of duty sought to act in all criminal Prosecutions as became a vigilant officer & a humane Man. If official Zeal & the assurance of my mind that the Punishment of an offender was important to the Publick Welfare, has ever carried me too far, it has ever been a mistake in regard to my duty, & need I add at no time from a wish to oppress or tyrannize. In the case of the Terry v Grandpre, & the Coulons (which is the only one mentioned by Gen Callâ€”I always believed their conviction & punishment to be important as the riot was an outrageous one, & excited great Publick indignation at the time. The enclosed Documents (NÂ° 6 & 7.) being the evidence taken before the Magistrates upon which I have always proceeded will shew whether offences of no very trivial character were not committed by the Parties named, & whether it was not my duty to prosecute them to conviction. I have never believed because Judge Brackenridge has thought proper to screen the offenders by repeatedly quashing the bills (as I have always thought illegally) after their being repeatedly found by Successive Grand Juries.â€”I have never beleived I repeat that it was my duty to neglect the Prosecutions for this reason. The Papers (NÂ° 8 & 9.) shew the Indictments at the May Term against these Parties and the grounds upon which they were quashed in several of the cases in which it appeared clearly to the Attorney that the Parties should have been held to answer and not have been discharged in the Summary mode adopted, which is contrary clearly to the continued practice of other Courts.â€”That I have been lenient to these parties will appear from the enclosed paper (NÂ° 10.) where an application was made to me after the May Term, to waive the recognizance to enable them to leave the Country, which was readily complied with, but as they remained, & were as daring & ferocious as formerly (being thorough Spaniards in the worst traits of that people)â€”I deemed it my duty to proceed against them when they were again & again protected by the Judge's decisions to quashâ€” to which movement Col. Barnets affidavit affords the only clue as I have thought. The only other prominent cases which I recollect & which can have found their way to Washington to be handled by my Assailantsâ€”are those of Mess"" Myers & Parmentier. In those cases I had believed the evidence fully sustained the Bills, & that they must be found: but the Bills were resent to the Grand Jury on account of important additional evidence. Althoâ€™ I have ever as a publick officer deemed it competent for me to resend a bill of Indictment to a Grand Jury where I have beleived they clearly mistook the lawâ€”, or the evidence, which has happened in my experience here more than once or twice & been conceded by the Jury.â€”when bills have been resent by requestâ€”The paper (NÂ° 11.) is a brief of evidence (in the case upon the Civil docket) which was agreed upon & filed by Counsel & it was upon this & other evidence that the bills were prefered to the Grand Jury I have desired Alex Scott Esq. of Georgetown, who has the deposition of the Witnesses in this matter to have them deposited in the Department of State to be used in the present investigation. It has always appeared to myself that the only reasons why the bills were not found was that John Innerarity was at the head of the Grand Jury & that so many foreigners or rather adopted Citizens were upon the Juryâ€”As regards this part of the chargesâ€”there being no specification of other cases I conclude by saying, that I beleived always & now, that I have sought to perform my duty in every prosecutionâ€”as to the Note Signed â€œJ. Innerarity Foreman) which was handed in by that character to the Court & which was intended as a return on the Bills or a Note of Conversation to the Courtâ€”it was instantly rejected and a return made upon the Bills in open Courtâ€”The note was then Surreptitiously placed upon the Records, & on my discovering it during the Termâ€”it was upon my Motion ordered to be expunged from the records as a paper which was very improperly placed upon itâ€”which paper as I learn has been forwarded to Washington as a recorded Presentment. From the numerous charges against John Innerarity for offences committedâ€”and his misconduct during the Term inducing the Jury to refuse Bills without examining a Witness upon themâ€”from his being & from his having been discharged by his own consent from the Grand Jury and a new Foreman appointed & sworn & his then resuming his seat I felt it my duty to move for his discharge as Foremanthis the Court promptly overruled & he was detained to reject the Bills against Myersâ€”and to endeavor to effect a presentment against myself. A Bill for swindling was then upon my Desk against him which was amply supported & the hostility which he has always shewn * has arisen as I am convinced from his being criminally chargeable in many transactions here. I will hereafter take leave to say a single word with regard to him & dismiss him.â€” | As to the last matter mentioned by Genl Call to me as being charged vizimmoral & disorderly conduct, as I before observed I can not think it proper or useful to seek out affidavits or certificates to disprove this one of the numerous falsities attempted with reference to me. With respect to the alleged Presentments at the November Term of the Super Court, I refer to the paper (No 12) where the presentments will be seen in full & also the order to quash, which was taken immediately upon their being returned into Court & before they could be considered as having been even filed.â€”The Court being convinced from the universal knowledge of the facts here, that even with its wish to sustain them, it was impossible to do so with safety gave the order aforesaid.â€”The facts upon which both the presentments (in which appears the name of the U S Attorney appears) were as follows: on the night of the twenty fifth of october last a festive party was convened at the house of Genl Richard K. Call in Pensacolaâ€” when the gentlemen (among whom were the most respectable in W Florida civil & military) who were present became in the event over joyous with their libations and perhaps somewhat too resonant in their notes of mirth & on their return homeward without having committed the slightest illegal act, but only sonorous in their merriment without molesting thing or creature were assailed by a party of constables who sought to imprison them, the writer W F Steele among the number, but considering the measure rather too high handed they eventually desisted & suffered the gentlemen to proceed to their houses. A malicious individual of the assailant party who went before the Grand Jury endeavored to marshal witnesses enough to induce a presentment, & from the positive swearing upon the occasion, the Grand Jury felt themselves bound to return a presentment, from a vague & mistaken belief that some offence had been proved to have been committed. The other Presentment against the District Attorney alone was equally malicious and unfounded as it was charged upon a converse upon the subject of the previous occurrence, and was utterly false as will be perceived by the affidavit (No 13) of Mâ€ W Davison herewith sent. And the deponent M D is a man asâ€“Genl Jackson & Genl Call will readily establish to be fully relied upon. It remains only to observe Sir as to this that the Presentments were never even placed upon the Records of the Court but were destroyed before they were even lodged in office, & the Clerks certificate annexed NÂ° 12 shews that these are the only ones ever made in this Court in which the Attorney's name was incorporated.â€” The last paper Sir (NÂ° 14) is one of no trivial character, being a free will offering at the hands of the three Gentlemen who have signed their names & who have been successively Foreman of the Grand Juries with whom I have acted. Mr Allen at Septr Special Term, Mr Lavalle at the Novr Term, and Mr Twitchell at the late Term of the County Court in Februaryâ€”But four Grand Juries have been panelled since my residence here & the three last named gentlemen were the presiding officers of three of them & the Foreman of the fourth jury (whose name is not present) I need only add was John Innerarity.â€” And I will beg leave Sir here to refer to the names of Genl Jackson & Genl Call at Washington to whom I am instructed to refer for the character of John Innerarity, as well as the standing of Mr Davison and the worthy Foremen of the Grand Juries already named. I believe Sir that it may be said with safety that except for my enemy the Judge (Brackenridge) & his party of guards with John Innerarity at their head, that there are not beside those ten respectable men in the District who would even wish for my removal.â€”As to who my accusers at Washington are, I can only conjecture who they may be.â€”If it be Judge Brackenridgeâ€”his feelings to me are proved by Col Barnett &c & in various waysâ€”If it be John Innerarity I need not say what reliance should be placed upon him.â€”The Commissioners Messrs White & Overton have thought proper also to be at open war with me for opposing the exaction of fees & which it would seem the Congress of the U States have declared by their bill at this session to be unjustifiable.â€”I need only to conclude then by expressing my hope that official weight may not be added to any think charged upon me by these same gentlemen.â€”I refer with confidence to my fellow citizens for my conduct and standing, and if I am removed, I shall be able Sir to refer to my bosom for that support which shall save me from mental prostration.â€” I had nearly Sir omitted one other subject which demands my attention. It is this that at the late Term of the County Court for this County upon the return of a Bill of Indictment against the Messrs Coulons, two blanks as to the alias dictus"" of the christian name were filled up by myself as matter of form in the first instance & as I then & still believe it to be, but afterwards supposing it might be by cavillers deemed matter of substance was re-submitted to the Grand Jury. The Bill was however quashed by the Court (Doct No 15 & 16) upon the ground that the alteration was made after the bill had been first returned & altho by grand Jury's consent, it avoided the Bill.

It is also a lamentable fact that much the largest number of deaf and dumb persons are found in the poor and indigent classes of Society and without the charitable aid of the Government, to the exertions of individuals, great numbers of those children of misfortune must forever be debarred of the means of restoration from mental darkness, to their proper rank in the scale of beingâ€” Your Petitioners cannot entertain a doubt, that our national Legislature will be actuated by those feelings which have characterised the acts of every other, before whom the claim has been brought of those, whom, God in the mysterious dispensations of his Providence, has deprived of the faculty of hearing and of speech, of whom, an eloquent divine has said â€œsilence like theirs is eloquence,â€ Your Petitioners were gratified to find that a former Congress gave with a liberal hand aid to the Hartford Institution, located in a convenient place to supply the North Eastern Section of the Union, and we hope that the national bounty will be extended to our Institution similarly located in the west.

ADAMS. - SIR. In a letter received from Fontaine Maury Esquire dated 6th January we find the following â€œAt the same time that I give you this information, I am directed to remark to you, that this appointment was by no means considered a permanent one, and that both the President, and Secretary of State, have been disappointed at not having long since been advised of the complete accomplishment of the duties appertaining to it. It is earnestly hoped and expected of you and your associate that you will bring this business to as spedy a close, as the circumstances of the case may admit of, and that you will give satisfactory explanations for its having been thus long kept open.â€.â€ In compliance with the above instructions we reply that we never did consider the appointment a permanent one, that from the terms of our Commission which directs us â€œto select from them for preservation among the archives of the Territory, â€œAll archives and Documents which relate directly to the property and sovereignty of the Provinces of East and West Florida, to take an Inventory of the same, and also of all other Documents and papers found among them.â€ we concluded that the Government was not satisfied with the manner in which the Documents had been previously examined by order of Mr. Worthington, and knowing that in that examination many Bundles of papers were not even untied, but retained or returned as was judg"" expedient by the mere reading of the label, and that this mode was by no means satisfactory to the people, as enquiries were daily making for papers said to have existed in the Office under the Spanish Government but were not to be found among those retained by the former Commissioners; under those circumstances we considered it our duty to examine and read every Document seperately in order to enable us to make that selection which the Government required and which the inhabitants expected of us. This duty we have performed in a faithful and attentive manner and have selected from 64.299â€”Documents 423. many of which have already proven to be important to the Board of Land Commissioners and many others are equally so to private individuals. We now enclose a Copy of the Inventory in English which will serve further to show the manner in which we have executed the Commission,â€ as also our separate acts for the ballance of pay due us, * Not found. See ante, p. 820. and the account of the expences incurred in the course of the examination; we have in our present account deducted the number of days which we thought would have been deducted from the first quarters salary, as in our letter to the Department dated August 1823. we stated that the examination had been suspended from the 24"" May to 7* July in consequence of Mr. Reynolds being engaged as a Member of the Legislative Councilâ€” We trust this explanation will prove as satisfactory to the Government as the manner of executing our Commission has to people of this part of the Territory.

(Fla.):ALS",Correspondence,JAMES GADSDEN TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR,JAMES GADSDEN,THE SECRETARY OF WAR,"SIR By Lieu"" Albertiâ€ I informed you of my return to this place; I have now the honor to report more in detail as to my operations under the commission to survey the Indian boundary lineâ€”The limits allotted the Indians were to commence at a point 5 miles North of Okehumke; but if on examination of the Country it should be found that there was not a sufficient quantity of land adequate to the support of the Indians to be received within the boundaries designated; then the north line was to be extended so as to ensure that objectâ€”On examination I found the country fully equal to the support of the Indian population, as reported, combining agriculture, stock, and hunting, provided the Settlements at Okehumke and at Setarkys could be preserved *â€”Indeed the commencement of the reservation 5 miles north of Okehumke was with a view to that object, and the stipulation of a removal in certain events, was conceded in order to reconcile as far as practicable the Indians of those settlements to the general terms of the Treatyâ€”It was found on examination however that the line, first called for, encroached upon the settlement of Setarky approaching within sight of his improvements, and running through the centre of his grazing groundsâ€”Independent of the vicinity of the same line to the establishment at Okehumke, the closing line to its commencement would likewise have passed through the grazing grounds of that settlement; which would have proven vexatious to the Indian as run appearantly with no object, securing to a white population no additional advantages as to security, soil fit for cultivation, or grounds connected with agricultural establishments which might be madeâ€”It was deemed therefore advisable to extend the north line, and it has been done to 10 miles north of Okehumke, running East & West to the waters of the Ocklewaha, and the swamps of the Amaxura or Withlachuche riverâ€”from thence the boundary has been surveyed as called for in the Treaty to the south end of the Big Hammockâ€” The article required such a direction however to this line as to include Checuchateâ€”A line to the South end of the Big Hammock would, if continued in the same direction, have passed thro: and interferred with the Hammock & Savannah of Checuchatte, so as to have seriously affected the settlement in that quarterâ€”The continuation of the line for 4 miles therefore, and within the spirit of terms, â€œto include Checuchatteâ€ has been made to deviate a little to the west from the original directionâ€”From thence it is run and marked (with the exception of some interposing & impenetrable swamps as defined in the Treaty untill the same terminates in a great savannah the commencement of the extensive south western hunting groundsâ€”These savannahs are said to extend south & east to within a few miles of the Atlantic & independent of the impracticability of passing over them, from their peculiar character; the want of wood water &c it would have been impossible otherwise to have defined the line for the want of objects to markâ€”The South line running East & Westâ€” and the East line â€œNorth fifteen west for 50 milesâ€â€”as called for in the 2"" article of the Treaty will pass over these extensive grassy planes and cannot be defined; the closing line to the beginning may I presume to a certain extent be surveyed & marked; but the advancing of the northern line necessarily produced a change in this & its direction could not be ascertained untill the probable length of the Southern line was determined by known points and distances on the Atlanticâ€” I should have proceeded on the operation but the uncertainty of being able to penetrate by the Atlantic shore to the south; the time necessary to the accomplishment of the object; the exhausted state of my provisions, reduced condition of men & horses, the lateness of the season & importance of marking the reservations on the Appalachicola immediately all concurred to predth induce a postponement of what may be performed at any other time without detrement to the public serviceâ€”This line will doubtless terminate or unite with the eastern line on the same extensive district of savannahs & Ponds noted, and beyond which no designation of the Indian boundary can be madeâ€”If it could it would in my opinion, considering the general character of the territory South be unimportant, and unquestionably vexatious to the Indian population as seeming to deprive their Hunters of the use of a district of country which can never be converted to any use by white populationâ€”It is valued by the Indians only for the game which it affords. They do not & cannot reside on or near that district of savannahs & it is only visited by them during the dry and winter or hunting seasonsâ€”The Indians must necessarily form their settlements near the Northern & Western limits and sourses of Talachopco Creekâ€”Their permanent improvements therefore will be concentrated to a certain extent, while during the hunting season alone they will roam over the extensive savannahs South in quest of gameâ€”To have marks therefore on this district to restrict them in their hunts would appear vexatious without any objectâ€”It may be advisable however to let the Indians distinctly understand the extent of their reservations as well as it can be explained; but that the Presi- dent of the U.S. permits them to make use of those grounds during the hunting season, prohibiting however any extension of their settlements in that quarter or near the sea coast southâ€”The line from the Eastern extremity of the northern limit as extended it would be important to have deferred as far as practicable; it would exhibit their bounds in that quarter & in conjunction with the western line explain the probable termination Southâ€”The marking of this line might be easily connected, and at but inconsiderable additional expence, with the survey of the contemplated road to Cape Floridaâ€”by which reconnoisance in conjunction with the one directed to Cape Sable a mass of information may be collected shedding much additional light on the geography of Floridaâ€”I accompany this with a hasty sketch which will assist in explaining for a time the direction & relative position of points lines &c untill a more perfect map of the country can be prepared from the notes & surveys made I have this day drawn upon you in fav of M T C Gibbs for three hundred & nine dollars on account of expenditures to running Indian boundary * & Your ob Se JAMES GADSDEN THE HON J C CALHOUN [Addressed] The Department of War Washington D Columbia [Postmarked] St Augustine 23 March free [Endorsed] S*Augustine, 20 March 1824.

"NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, XI:ALS",Correspondence,JOHN LEE WILLIAMS TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE,JOHN LEE WILLIAMS,THE SECRETARY OF STATE,"SIR I learn that charges have been prefered against William F. Steele Esq District Attorney for West Florida. What those charges are, I do not know, but I do know that he has been guilty of much improper conduct, and when I see men supporting him against their own convictions of his incapacity, I have thought that my duty to society & to the Government required me to make to you Excellency a statement of facts. I therefore beg you Excellency to excuse this intrusion on your valuable time. The dockets of our Courts herewith presented will shew in what manner our Criminal proceedings have been conducted. Should he endeavour to cast the blame of this wretched management, on the Judge of the District Court, the pure character of that Man will shield him from the aspersion, and it will be seen, that in the Circuit & County Courts, the mismanagement has been equally apparent. The whole course of Mr Steele's conduct here, has tended to shield the Guilty and to harrass the Innocent. Col. Barnet is said to be among his supporters"" yet Col Barnet in my presence declared that having employed Mr Steele to prosecute a Suit of his in Court, he found him so incompetent, that he would rather pay him to drop it, than to continue. Many other persons besides myself heard this opinion given without any reserve. But it has been since discovered that altho he is not competent to conduct legal proceedings he has been able to scribble libels in a profligate News Paper against the Col's pollitical opponents. Mr Davidson another of Mr Steeles zealous defenders during the last Summer shipped some Negroes to this place from New Orleans contrary to the Act of Congress but Mr Steele refused to prosecute him.â€ On this circumstance is founded the complaint of the Collector some time since forwarded to your Department. Yet Mr Steele lately Libelled the Florida Schooner in ten thousand dollars for bringing a Gentleman Servant with his Master from New Orleans. But Mr Davidson was and the other Gentleman was not a friend of Mr Steele. Prosecutions are constantly multiplying against this Man for Tailors Bills, for monies collected for his Clients and pocketed by him, his Library consisting of Chitty & Blackstone have been seized by the police officer to pay fines for riotous conduct in our streets and these books had not, nor have not yet been paid for. When any person has had the temerity to oppose him the least punishment they have had to expect was an Indictment for some high crime supported before the Grand Jury with his oath and pleadings. Certainly it is not for the honor of our Goverment to support the most intemperate and immoral man in Community as a pattern for offenders to copy, even should such a man be defended by a few persons for private pollitical ends. I therefore most respectfully pray your Excellency to lay before the President the evidencesâ€ accompanying this Letter and please to accept the assurances of the high consideration with which I have the honor to be Yr Excellencys humble Servant JOHN LEE WILLIAMS [Endorsed] Williams John Lee no date Rec"" 1 April 1824 respecting charges against M.

"NA:WD, QMG Letters Recd.:ALS",Correspondence,DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,DANIEL E. BURCH,THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,"GENERAL, I had the honor to receive by yesterday's mail your letter of the 16* February last""; this letter, if the mails were regular, ought to have been received on the 9"" Ulto., and I regret its previous failure, for if it had come to hand earlier it would have saved to the Quartermaster's department $.600 in the charter of a vessel on the 27"" Ulto. I had postponed making the charter until the last moment, hoping to receive your answer to my letter of 22"" January * in time to supercede its necessity, but there was provisions for the Troops at Tampa only up to the 15"" Inst. admitting that no Rations had been issued to Indians visiting the Post, which doubtless has been done; hence I did not think it prudent to delay chartering a vessel any longer, after the arrival of the mail before this last. I have engaged the Schooner Florida for the voyage at $800, and made it one of the conditions, as it did not materially affect the price of the charter, that she should touch at St. Marks on her return & bring from thence a Cargo of Military Stores. She has on board for Tampa, about 500 Barrels of Quartermaster's & Subsistence Stores, & I have also shipped on her, the four oxen hitherto kept in service at Cantonment Clinch, Colonel Brooke having stated to me in a letter recently received, that more Teams & one Waggon were indispensably necessary to enable him to put his men in Quarters before the hot Season commences.â€” It is with extreme diffidence that I shall incur so much expense to the department in exercising the discretionary power, with which you have honored me, in regard to purchasing the Schooner Florida; and think it necessary to apprise you of the reasons which determine me to do so.â€ The enclosed statement exhibits the Several amounts already paid or contracted for in this office for vessel transportation in a given period; and also the cost of sailing a suitable public transport during the same time, & which could have performed the same service with ease. It is to be observed that this Statement does not embrace the expense incurred for transportation of Officer's baggage from this place to Tampa within that period & which has amounted to, say, $.300 more. The vessel alluded to was brought out new last november, she is built of the best materials, is copper-fastened throughout, completely finished & wellfound in Sails, rigging, cabin furniture &c. She is what is termed a centre-board vessel, is of easy draught of water, & carries a large cargo in proportion to her tonnage. Last November, her owner, would have probably sold her for about $.4800; at present he has offered her to me for $.4000.â€”If the Ameliawasa suitable vessel for the public service at all, which she is not on account of her size, She is now nearly worn out & her Captain represents to me that she must immediately have a new suit of Sails & be partially rebuilt if retained in service. Her cargo is about 175 Barrels, and it requires but one man more, at $.20 per month, to navigate the Florida carrying 500 Barrels, than is necessary for the Amelia. She has been turned over to me by Captain Hunt agreably to your order & I am about to dispatch her to St. Marks for a cargo of the public property there; & on her return if the Florida is purchased, she will be of no further service in the department, & I shall sell her without putting any repairs on her, as it would probably cost as much, if not more, to repair her, than she would then sell for.â€” I do not mean to be understood that a public vessel will continue always to save as much as is shewn by the enclosed statement, because that must depend solely upon the activity of her employment; but it is more than probable that She will be actively employed, for independent of the necessary transportation of provisions &c. to Tampa, the entire failure of the Contractor to deliver provisions at this Post renders it necessary to procure them from New Orleans.â€” I have the honor to be Sir, with perfect respect Y Mo.

Cap"" D. E. Burch of the Quarter Masters Dep"" at Pensacola, has facilitated by every means in his power, the Completion of our barracks, by Complying most promptly with all the necessary requisitions.â€”By the middle of this month, the men will be in their quarters, which are the best log buildings I have ever seen, both for health & duration the rooms being large, high, airy, and as well put together as possible, the whole 260 feet in length and 12 feet from floors to the loft. We have Completed the quarter Masters & Commissary's Store houses, bake house, The Hospital will be finished (viz two blocks of it) in ten days. The officers quarters have also been Commenced, Considering, that the first tree was felled on the 20"" Feb. I have every reason to be pleased with the great industry of the officers and Men, besides this each Company has a large garden, now in fine Cultivation.â€”I must beg leave to renew my application for two Ass"" Surgeons for should any epidemic disease take place here, we should be in a most deplorable situation. I wrote to the Surgeon Gen' on this subject early in Jan * but, he has not done me the honor of ever answering my letter, Should we be unfortunate enough to have the Yellow fever, I shall feel myself relieved from all responsibility in as much, as I have written repeatedly to the Surgeon Gen.' on this subject. The Indians appear to me, to be more & more displeased at the Treaty, and still more so, at the running of the line, and I am not unapprehensive of some difficulty. They have an idea, that the nation, is about to go to war with Great Britain, and was it to be the the case, they would most certainly join our enemy. In Consequence of its having been reported to me that a large number of Indians, were seen near the Camp, after tattoo, who appeared to have an intention of taking us by surprise, the Troops, were put under arms, and Continued so during the night large paroles were also sent out some distance, but no Indian was discovered. As the Man who reported it to me, come running in, and stated that he had seen them not more than 15 Minutes before, an attack was calculated on most Certainly. The officers and Men turned out with an alacrity and spirit, which did them great credit, and I feel a Confidence, that no Indian force in this Country could meet us, with the least prospect of success, although they can bring at least 700 warriors into the field. There is an absolute necessity of some field pieces here, and I beg, that the Commdg officer at Pensacola may be directed to have transported to this place, two six pounders, with a proper supply of Ammunition and implementsâ€”We have discovered that this place, has been a depot for pirates, finding the other day, the remains of three unfortunate persons who from the shot holes, in their hats, and from stakes set in the ground, with ropes attached to them & the appearance of fire, that some of them had been shot and others burnt to death.

In addition to what is stated, I will add that the boundary of the country intended for their occupation, has not yet been finally settled. Co"" Gadsden wrote to me from Charlotte Harbour, that the lands in the Peninsula are by no means equal to his expectationâ€” The Northern line of the Indian boundary will I presume be extended according to the Treaty Co"" Humphreys meet with Co."" Gadsden on his way from St. Augustin to Pensacola and conversed with him on these subjects I am happy to say that his opinions are dicidedly with me, in the vieus I have expressed on these subjectsâ€” It will be less expensive to furnish the Indians with Beef, than pork, The Beef can be driven to the several points requirid, for even less than the Pork could be purchased for in New Orleans. Con and Salt or Flour if corn can not be obtained, will be had cheapest in New Orleans, I am satisfied that many of the Indians will leave the Seminoles and settle among the creeks before the next fall, It is my opinion that not more than fifteen hundred, will remove into the boundaryâ€”this opinion has been formed on my own observation and intelligence, derived from the Indians while I was with them during last winterâ€”Whatever order you may deem proper to give, either as to the removal or manner of supplying the Indians shall be promptly executed, should you intertain any vieus different from my own. If the arrangements are left to my discression, the most rigid economy consistent with the fair and just execution of the Treaty, will govern me in the expenditure of the funds which may be transmitted for this objectâ€”]â€ The authority to draw on your department for fundsâ€”cannot be used to advantage, in Florida for large sumsâ€”The circulating medium, of this Territory, is principaly composed of the Bank paper of Alabama Georgia and North Carolina â€”which are not current in New Orleansâ€”I would therefore suggest the propriety of making the Bank of New Orleans the Deposit of the funds to be used in Florida, so that from time to time I could check for the money. I should not like to have a large sum in my handsâ€”for I have no place of safetyâ€”to secure it, and accident or robbery might render me responsible, I hope by the active, assistance of Co"" Humphreysâ€”on whom I can confidently releyâ€”that the Treaty will be carried into effect for much less then was expected, If you have not appointed a sub agent, in the place of Capt. Pelham, I recommend Sargent Ayres belonging to the command at St. Augustin This man attracted my particular attention during the last year and he is cirtainly one of the finest soldiers in our Army, he is sober, active, sensible, and completely a man of businessâ€”He has always enjoyed the confidence and esteem of his superior Officersâ€”This mans appointment would render a service to our countryâ€”Ayres never applied to me on this subject, and nothing but his uncommon merit could induce me to recommed him to you, It is important, that the person who may be appointed, should receive your order forthwith to report himself either to Co.""

The circumstance of the absence of the Agent will not justify any advance upon this latter sum. I have directed the allowance to be made on your account in conformity with this view, and the instructions of my letter of the 25"" Oct"" last. It may be proper to remark that there is no allowance made by law, other than for your Salary as Governor, for the performance of your duty as Superintendent, but it is made as a matter of justice out of the appropriation on account of Indian Affairsâ€”no allowance, of course, can be made by the Department, but to cover the expense which may be incidentally incurred in the performance of such duty.

"NA:PO, PMG Letter Book D",Correspondence,THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO ROBERT MITCHELL,THE POSTMASTER GENERAL,ROBERT MITCHELL,"ROB' MICHELL P M Pensacola W F SIR. That part of my circular, which required the oath of printers to accompany their return of newspapers sent by mail, was stricken out before the circular was forwarded to Postmasters, though retained in the publication of it in the newspapers. The object of obtaining printers certificates is quite as much to accommodate them, and facilitate the circulation of their papers, as to aid the Dep"" in its operations. The law requires them to write in every bundle of papers the number which it contains chargeable with postage; and to do this when they Send to a great number of different Post Offices in many instances proves a Serious inconvenience to them, and when the issuing of their papers is at the last moment before the departure of the mail, this additional labour, and the time necessarily occupied by the Postmaster in taking an account of them, will often delay their papers till the departure of another mail. To prevent all this delay, if printers will furnish Postmasters with a list of the number of papers Sent to each Office, certifying to the best of their knowledge its correctness they need not mark the number upon each bundle, and the Postmaster need make no delay to take the account but to forward them as they are put in his Office, and forward the printers certificate for the account of newspapers Sent from his Office. If the printer refuses to do this (which I think he will not, after understanding the object) you will Still receive and forward his papers, provided he endorses the number upon every bundle, and you will yourself keep the account of the number to each Office, but enter none of them upon your post-bills. You will keep your account of newspapers received for delivery at your Office, by charging yourself in advance at the beginning of each quarter for the quarterly amount of all papers regularly coming to your Office; and for such as come occasionally, you will charge yourself at the time of their arrival, at the end of the quarter enter the whole amount in your a/c current.""

I am also gratified to learn that you had approved of my engaging the transportation to this place, in the absence of Captain Burch, and further, that you had directed him to supply us, with evry thing necessary, to make us comfortable. From the moment of Capt. Bs. arrival from St Augustine, he has done evry thing which could facilitate the movement, and the promptitude with which, he has since met the necessary requisitions, deserves my warmest acknowledgements. In consequence of the landing the stores, on our first arrival here, and the cutting out, of the thickest under growth, I have ever seen, for the purpose of fixing the scite, we were not enabled to go into the woods til the 20"" Feb, on which day, the first tree was felled. Since that period, we have completed, a very fine comissy & quarter masters store house, an excellent bakehouse four blocks, for the mens barracks, (two rooms each block) 25 feet by 20, 12 feet, from the floors, to the joists, raised, on Blocks 3 feet from the ground, the whole under one roof & shingled between the intervals of each block (being 20 feet) & with a portico of 12 feet wide, surrounding the building. The men will occupy this building to day. which is now comfortable, but will require, more finishg, which can be done at our liesure. This I think is the best place for quarters in a southern climate, particularly in so low a latitude as this, the rooms, being well aired, and shaded. The officers quarters & hospital built on the same plan, are all up, and will be completed, by the first of June, provided the brick & some more plank which we have required, arrive in time. I have searched in evry direction near us, for clay to make brick, or stone, for the chimneys, which I am unable to find, and indeed the Indians tell me, there is none in the country. This post, in its first establishment, may be more expensive, than the Government probably expect, but when once completed, no other expence can be incurrd than the common contingent expences of all posts. It is absolutely necessary, that evry precaution should be taken, to prevent disease, but I cannot feel less than very apprehensive of being visited by some epidemic.

The reasons you assign for delaying the removal of the Indians, are entirely satisfactory. You will determine in your discretion, upon the proper time, in the ensuing autumn, to begin this work of removal, and commence accordinglyâ€” meanwhile the advertizing for the supplies will be delayed. When you do advertize you will give notice at New Orleans, and Charleston, as well as at S*Augustine. As to the kinds of provisions which may be best, their selection is left to your discretion. The season for removal being deferred 'til the ensuing Autumn, I will thank you meanwhile, and as early as you can, to furnish me with an estimate of the cost which is likely to attend upon the emigration, upon the best data you may be able to command. A requisition for the amount will be made on the Treasury in due time for you and the most favourable arrangements made as to the place of deposit that can be commanded. I am glad to learn that the amount will fall short of the Sum hitherto estimated to carry this Treaty into effect. Your recommendation of a Sub-agent is under consideration and will be acted on in due time. I am favourably impress'd towards the Chief, Nea-ma-tha-la, and as he will doubtless make one of the four who are authorized to visit Washington, he will have every attention paid to him which your representation of his rank and character entitles him to. I will cheerfully, if it wouâ€™d not be thought to weaken his influence among his people, by the excitement of Jealousy, allot him a small annuityâ€”of the propriety of this from your better acquaintance with the disposition and temper of these Indians you can best judgeâ€”or if it wouâ€™d be more agreeable, I see no objection to a purchase of his reservation, as you suggest, provided it couâ€™d be done on reasonable terms. I think it very desireable that he shou'd accompany the emigrantsâ€”his influence as you remark wou'd doubtless be very Salutary.â€ I am very Respectfully &c J. C.

The late hour at which the mail arrived last evening, & not being myself possessed of all the information you have been pleased to require of me, will prevent my complyance untill next mail. I hope it will then be in my power to make you a satisfactory reply. The roads contemplated to be opend in this Territory must necessarily prove of great advantage to the Nation. I trust you will think as I do, knowing how much it is in your power to promote their early accomplishment.â€”I notice with much pleasure that part of your Letter in which you speak of your wish to make a settlement in this Country, as I am inclined to believe you could not make choice of any section of the United States which presents greater Agricultural advantages than this. There is a tract of excellent Hammock & Swamp land immediately near the place where the town of New Smyrna was to have been built which is offered for Sale. I will endeavour to ascertain the terms on which it can be purchased & will acquaint you. I would however prefer to have you settle more in my Neighbourhood, Say at Matanzas about thirty miles South of this City. The lands there are equally good & in my estimation suitable either for the culture of Cotton or Sugar Cane & with the advantage of having an extended Range for Cattle both of good Pine barren & Savannah land. The latter are indeed composed of very rich Soil, folming three distinct stratum, the first is a pliable black Mould, 2"" a Soil some what of the consistancy of Clay, & the 3"" of very Strong Marl. I ditched thirty acres of it & found it all to be the Same; & I planted 9 acres of it in Corn & three ef in Cotton as an experiment; the former I am satisfied will do well, but, not the latter, as the Marl is Hatteh agreed not favourable to that plant.â€”From the proximity of these Savannahs to the waters of the head of the river Matanzas I am persuaded they must have been originally Salt water Marshes & the Marl bottoms formed from the decomposition of Oyster Shells. If our Board of land Commissioners could act with more activity in the adjudication of titles to lands, this Country would soon present a very different aspect from what it now does.â€”There is always some fatality attending our public concerns here. At present we have but two Commissioners & one of them (Judge Blair, a truly good & worthy character) is so very ill that he can scarecy attend to the duties of the board, nor is he expected to be much longer for this world! ! his loss would be great to this Country.""â€”The titles to lands here are not so bad as they have been represented, there are some groundless pretentions, such as the claims from British emigrants & others who have forfeited their rights by abandonment & by a noncomplyance of the conditions on which the land was granted to them. This class of claims conflict much with the right of the legitimate owner, but, were it not for the existance of these false claims, which under the Spanish government would never have been brought forward, the Gentlemen of the Bar would must be with little or no employment; & it is the dread of requiring their service which for some time will deter both sale & purchase, at least untill the commissioners have adjudicated on the claims. With reference to my next permit me to close this with the assurance of my being Dear Sir with much esteem Your Ob Serv"" JOSEPH M HERNANDEZ Excuse my English, it is some what unconnected.

Crawford giving an imperfect, insufficient and erroneous account of the circumstances of the commission dated 29 December 1823 * the same day the majority rejected a proposition to make an official report and keeping the inspection of the said letter from Alexander Hamilton until the 28 of January 1824â€”a few days anterior to the expiration of the term in virtue of which they were appointed 8"" The incompatibility of engaging as counsel in suits at law, involveing conflicting interests arising out of adverse grants and especially in the case of John H. M*Intosh involving in its decission almost all the important principles necessary to be settled by the Commission, anticedent to the commencement of its adjudications and this practice, accompanied with the more extraordinary fact, that immediately previous to the examination of M*Intosh's case,â€ the majority refused absolutely to establish any general principles to be referred to as governing the decisions of the Commission and in consequence Alexander Hamilton declined all responsible interference in the adjudications, and had the same recorded specially on the minutes. 9* The indelicate disregard to the confidential character of the Commission in an intention & deliberate determination to appoint any person who could conscientiously consider himself at liberty to take the prescribed oath of office,â€”while totally and entirely ignorant of the Spanish language and under which incompatible circumstances, they proposed to appoint Joseph B Lancaster, brother in law to William W Blair, for which purpose he had accompanied the majority from Kentucky and attempted to justify the measure on the precedent of a corresponding case in West Florida. In consequence of the objections from Alexander Hamilton the appointment was not made, who read to the majority and inquired distinctly and emphatically whether they thought the applicant could conscientiously take the oath of office. The commissioners seperated with an understanding that the appointment of a secretary should be the subject of future considerationâ€” The result was that the majority in persuance of a previous seperate arrangement appointed Francis J Fatio secretary to the commission,â€ and Davis Floyd moved that an assistant should be appointed in order FL OR I D A TERRITOR Y 947 to introduce Joseph B Lancaster to a participation of the emoluments of the office,â€ in correspondence with a bargain between Fatio and said Lancaster which motion was withdrawn at the suggestion of Alexander Hamilton that neither the law nor the occaision authorised such a measure The result however showed that neither consistency nor public obligation could prevent the appointmentâ€” On the 3d August"" on motion of Alexander Hamilton it was â€œordered, that only so much of the Spanish documents were required to be translated by the claiments as might be deemed essential to a fair understanding of the claimsâ€ On the 5* August on motion of Davis Floyd it was resolved, that the claimants would not be required to produce translations of their title papers and that it should thenceforth be the duty of the secretary to furnish translations.â€ To this motion Alexander Hamilton dissented, and gave as his reason, the enevitable procrastination, of the business of the commission to the Sacrafice, of the public and private interests, at the same time suggesting as a more judicious course that an account be kept of the claimants expenses for the purpose of refering it to the consideration of Congress for reimbursement. The claimants objected to the expence and the majority decided in their favour. The consequence was that numerous applications were made by the claimants for permission to withdraw their papers in order to have them translated at their own expence. It was impossible for the secretary to perform the duty imposed on him On the determination of the majority to have all Spanish documents translated by their secretary it was moved by Alexander Hamilton to appoint ex necessitateâ€”Clerks qualified according to the provisions of the act of Congress which was rejected and Joseph B Lancaster appointed assistant secretary, at the suggestion of Francis J. Fatio, under the engagement for a division of the emoluments of the Office 10â€”The majority are charged with a perfect knowledge of all the above circumstances and consequent evasion and misrepresentation in stateing in their semi official letter to the secretary of the Treasury of the 29 December 1823 â€œthat under the pressing circumstances of the commission the secretary had been required to employ an assistant which reduced his regular salary to a mere pittance and that it would be ungenerous and unjust to ask of him to employ anotherâ€â€”If the secretary performed his duty, the Commission had no right whatever might be the urgency or pressing character of the circumstances to require the secretary to employ an assistant at his own expence- The law created the duty and affixed the salary at $1250, which my colleagues at the time they wrote their letter, beleived would amount to $2500 including fees, although unfortunately for their opinion Congress has thought other wise, if the necessity called for assistance the exercise of a sound discression would have been liberally advocated and no doubt sanctioned by the â€œgenerosity and magnanimity of Congressâ€â€”, and in this spirit was the proposition to appoint as many clerks as were necessary, properly qualified 11 The majority report as an excuse for requiring an additional clerk that one of the secretaries â€œwas constantly employed in recording the evidence of title &c""â€”while they well knew that neither of the persons in the employment of the Commission were or ever had been so engaged and that as late as the 5"" of February 1824 â€œthe recording of the evidence of title &c""â€”had not commencedâ€”It is now avered that the real cause was, that the embarrassments of the Commission arising out of the want of system required that an extraordinary effort should be made, in order to satisfy Congress that the Commission had not entirely misapplied its time 12 It is peculiar, and certainly did not create the most favourable impressions that in the private semi official letter of the 29 Dec 1823 any solicitude should be expressed to releive the claimants from the charge of fees, a communication which might not have been treated as a public letter as it commenced â€œDear Sir,â€ while it was matter of record, that a resolution restraining the authority of the secretary, to collect the recording fees had not been concurred in. 13 The majority are charged with constructions of the acts of Congress, unwarranted by any equavocation or incongruity incident either to the reason, spirit or phaseology of the laws. 14 The majority represent to Congress, that it had been â€œtheir first business,â€ to examine and ascertain the law governing the distributions of the public lands, in order â€œto do justice with exactitudeâ€â€”between the parties, while the minutes record, that the refusal to do so, was the ultimate cause that resolved Alexander Hamilton on the 20 Janâ€™ to withdraw from the adjudicationâ€â€”This contradiction is further supported by the correspondence of Davis Floyd and Alex' Hamilton of the 8 Jan 1824"" written for the express purpose to pro- duce some arrangement and corroborated by the majority in their letter of the 27 Jan 1824, addressed to A. Hamilton "" and with his answerâ€ transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury as will appear by refference to his letter dated Charleston 25 Feb. 1824.â€ The royal order of 1813 * had not been seen by the Commissioners anticedent to their adjudications and according to the report of the majority they had never inspected the ordinance of Governor Quesada of the 20 Nov 1790,"" which, if they had ever examined and understood they would not have subjected themselves to the charge of attempting to impose upon Congress in alleging that Gov. Quesada in his ordinance of 2 Sept 1790"" referred to a royal order vesting him with plenary powers to dispose of the public lands 15â€”William W. Blair in his letter to R M Johnson Esqr.â€ states that in all cases where the claims exceeded 1000 acres and the claimants were not in actual possession, that they were ordered to be reported to Congress for thire considerationâ€”On the 4 Feb' there was no such order and I venture to assert without having examined the minutes of the few subsequent days that no such order now exists and that such assertions is possitively contradicted in the list of reported cases. This representation in Excuse, arose out of a letter written by A Hamilton on this subject to the majorityâ€” 16 Davis Floyd is charged with being engaged in a suit at law, to recover for the heirs of Tait a tract of land, which had been forfeited from non possession, upon a contingent fee of $100, which said case he strenuously advocated before the Commission notwithstanding the majority had previously confirmed a claim in favour of the heirs of the said Tait given to the testator in lieu of the one forfeited and requested A Hamilton to interfere; who refusedâ€”as he had declined adjudicating with the majorityâ€” 17â€”It is extraordinary that William W. Blair's letter to the secretary of the Treasury * in which he represents that the fees charged for recording the titles and evidence of the claims were burthensome to the claimants and requesting the secretary, to give his construction of the law in relation to the said charge should have the St. Augustine postmark of the 18"" of November and endorsed by him on the outside â€œcopyâ€ while the letter bears date the 7 of August previous and no other copy of the said letter has been received in the Treasury Department.â€",1824,May,25,1824-05-25,WASHINGTON,2039,1824.0525

Having been advised within a short period by the worthy Delegate from this Territory that my defence &câ€”had been received at Washington & that as he beleived I had nothing to fear from the malignant attacks of my Enemies which had been made before the President, I spoke here of these advices with some gratification of heart, and when this had reached them, either thro my remarks, or the advices of their Agents at Washingtonâ€”my answers were not long in renewing their assaults upon me apparently with renewed vigor. Aware that if an entire failure of their attack at Washington should ensue that the blow must recoil upon themselves and that the respectable part of the community were beginning to manifest an honest indignation at the manifestly unmerited persecution lavished upon an officer who was only obnoxious to them on account of a determined discharge of his duty, they deemed it essential in order to save themselves first to attempt to blacken the character of that officer by reports & suggestions and eventually to organize a formal attack upon him in the shape of charges, in the support of a rule of Court entered against him to shew cause why he should not be suspended or expelled as an Attorney from the Bar; and these charges exhibited too in a Court the Judge of which had long been known as his avowed enemyâ€”these charges preferred, & supported by the evidence, of Individuals whom that officer had been compelled officially to prosecuteâ€”and being moreover principally the very charges which had been before preferred by them at Washington which they apprehended without any hope of successâ€”Being fully confident that the avowed hostility of the Judge to the officer charged would insure their success before him, & enable them to make as formidable an array as could be wishedâ€”the proceeding was taken (as I am advised) for the purpose of being forwarded to the President to secure their success there, as well as to sustain themselves with the Publick here, & it is for this reason Sir, that I have made the present communicationâ€” without waiting to be informed whether their despatch has yet been forwarded.â€”The only additional charge to those first made against me to the President upon which I deem it necessary to touch at this time, is one which if true, should itself destroy me, but which is â€œbaseless as the fabric of a visionâ€â€”viz' that of having embezzled the money of my Clientsâ€”â€.â€”The facts Sir, are briefly these, -while acting as an attorney in Georgia, and having in my hands at times debts for collections to the amount of perhaps Forty thousand dollars there was a collection made by me for a Mr. W. I. Hobby of Georgia for several hundred Dollars, and without collecting to it I assumed the responsibility to him upon another Paper of his placed in my hands to the amount of several hundreds more. Being in flourishing & successful businessâ€”& connected in the 6th Circuit Court of the U.

"NA:SD, Misc.

These papers are kept in loose sheets, without any descriptive list, or record memoanda of their existanceâ€” The necessity of securing, without delay the original title papers, has become the more important since the issue of office transcripts of the concession, and confirmatory titles, by which every disadvantage is transferred to the United States, in the event of any lossâ€”Some of these documents are of so gross a character that they ought on the slightest inspection to be pronounced forgeries. The official correspondence, royal orders, and edicts, are of a still more delicate character, and on the preservation of these depends the ability to estimate, to what extent, the governors possessed power to dispose of the public lands, and consequently, how far the United States are bound by their actsâ€”The letters of the Florida governors are original drafts, in many instances interlined, subject to fraudulent alterations without the means of detection, acquiring their validity and authenticity from their relative associate situationâ€” In consideration of the importance and peculiar situation of these public Records, I recommend Edward R. Gibson and William Simmons, as entitled to the confidence of the Government, in order to carry into effect, any measures the President may deem proper to adoptâ€” Whoever may be appointed ought to be instructed to deposit all the official papers, having connection with the disposition of the public lands in trunks, and to engage as many persons as can be judiciously employed in taking transcripts; the title records to be copied in such convenient form, as to admit of their being bound together, to compose a territorial Book of Recordsâ€”There ought to be an alpabetical arrangement of the Grants, with an appropriate index, and the originals appertaining to each associated, labelled, and correspondently scheduledâ€”The transcripts to be deposited with the Keeper of the Public Archives, and the originals to be guarded, to await the future disposition of Congress. The originals of the documents accompanying my report are in the office of the Commission, and, like all other papers, subject to improper inspection. Of theese there were thirty five brought before the Commission, by a subpoena duces tecum and retained in opposition to M Blair, in order to have them transcribed, * House Journal, 18 Cong., 1 sess., p. 592.  the expense of which did not exceed thirty dollarsâ€”M Floyd was in Indiana- In the confidence that this business will be the subject of a more rigid legislative examination, I refrain, for the present, from entering into a more minute explanation of the inducements for a prompt and efficient interference, to guard all the public records from every irresponsible intrusion. In as much as I have embarked every responsibility in the perfection of this examination, I should be pleased to have an opportunity to superintend the translation and arrangement of the royal orders, edicts and official correspondence, which it is in my power to do to advantage, as I possess some acquaintance with the Spanish languageâ€” It will at all times afford me much satisfaction to give any information that may be in my possessionâ€”I have understood that Mess"" Blair and Floyd are still adjudicating; would it not be adviseable that they report their proceedings? otherwise, the government, by the translation of M* Blair to the judiciary, will be deprived of the means of ascertaining upon what principles they have decided, and consequently the whole will have to be done over *â€”And the Commission, as now constituted, ought to make a similar report on the 1*November next, to be laid before Congress at the commencement of the approaching session.â€ I have the honor to remain with much respect Your Ob H Sev"" ALEXANDER HAMILTON HON: JOHN Q.

* I have expressed to you my opinion as to the capability of the Country for sustaining the Indian population to be provided for in Florida, and have in detail given my reasons for extending the north line as conditionally agreed uponâ€”I was the more confirmed in the opinion as expressed above from ascertaining the fact that the Indian population in Florida had been greatly exagerated and that the number to be contentrated South would not probably exceed 2500 or 3000â€”The good lands adapted to the purposes of agriculture and which are productive in rice, corn, and the esculent roots, are principally high & low hammocks, and lay in detached spots of greater or less magnitude; surrounded by extensive districts of elevated or flat pine lands, valuable for the grazing of stock, or as hunting groundsâ€”The combining the three objects of agriculture, stock & hunting will therefore, within the limits allotted, furnish more than an abundant supply of the subsistence of life for a greater Indian population than the one contemplatedâ€”To agriculture however necessity only can force the Indians, and it is not to be expected, in a country like Florida not yet exhausted of game, that the earth will be cultivated by the savage to a greater extent than to supply the deficiency of the chase or the bread part of subsistenceâ€”Time only can innovate on deep rooted prejudices & where change is necessary, it will naturally be to that condition most assimilated to the one to be abandonedâ€”The character of the herdsman approaches to that of the hunter, and in a country favourable to the raising of stock the efforts of the Indian may be the more easily directed to that channelâ€”The Indians in Florida have long known how to appreciate these advantages; the wars in which they have been engaged have however impoverished their resourses; & suspended their energiesâ€”Restore confidenceâ€”ensure protectionâ€” and steadily persevere in the annual distributions of stock of cattle & hogs contemplated, and within a few years the Florida Indians will be among the number of the best conditioned of the aborigines of Americaâ€” The Hammocks of best character, and of greatest extent are to be found at Okahumkyâ€”Negro settlements at Withlacouchy Creek & Pelacklekahaâ€”Checuchattyâ€”near the sourses of Hillsborough riverâ€” and on Peace Creek & its tributariesâ€”In addition to these hammocks, the banks of Pear Creek, from its sourse in a large pond for 15 miles south, furnishes a body of 2"" rate pine land elevated and productiveâ€” There are two Indian villages in this district of pines, the condition of which are favourable evidences of the productiveness of the soil and healthiness of the countryâ€”The settlements will necessarily be confined to the above districts of hammocks & pine land, a circumstance to be considered favourable, as it must lead to such a concentration of population as will render a judicious location of the agency practicable, and ensure to the agent greater facilities for protecting the interests of the Indianâ€”The balance of the Country can only be appropriated to grazing and hunting grounds; the latter confined to the south east & west and to be visited only during the season favourable for the chaseâ€” It will be perceived, as previously reported, that the western line terminated south in one of those extensive savannahs peculiar to Florida and which are known as the great Indian hunting groundsâ€” Beyond that no line could have been traced for the want of objects to mark, and it was very doubtful whether the country from its character could have been traversed, independent of its being alike deficient in water & woodâ€”My party therefore retrogaded from Charlottes harbor north, by a more eastern route than the one by which we descended, and surveyed & marked the north line as recommended to be extendedâ€”From its Eastern extremity, the propriety of adopting the ocklewaha river to its sourse as a boundary is respectfully suggested, and from thence in a direction so as to close with the eastern line aggreed on in the treatyâ€”The red dots exhibit this line as proposed to be run; the reasons for not marking which have been explained in a previous communication I would recommend the survey of this line the Early part of the ensuing winter; as important, not only in designating the Indian limits East, but as calculated to add much to the geographical information of this hitherto unknown countryâ€” The season was unfavourable for marking the boundaries of the land allotted the Indian Chiefs in the Middle district of Floridaâ€”The reservations for Econchatemeco, and Nehemathla have been defined as agreed upon, but the spring floods had so innundated the swamps of the Appalachicola as to prohibit any but an incomplete survey of the reservations for Blunt, Cochran & Mullato Kingâ€”To prevent however any disturbance which might arrise from the ignorant encroachments of Emigrants I have marked lines (at a distance so as to designate the direction ef extent of the North & south boundary) from the edge of the swamp to their probable termination west- When the waters subside, and the swamp of the Appalachicola can be measured it will be an easy operation to complete the survey as originally contemplatedâ€” I was disappointed of the opportunity of a personal consultation (agreeably to your request) with Governor Duval as to the measures best calculated to ensure a Speedy & economical execution of the terms of the treatyâ€”I fully expected, (from a conference held with Co! Humphreys, at Okahumky) to have met him & the Governor at Tallahassee, but circumstances appear to have detained them both longer at Pensacola than contemplatedâ€”I embraced however an opportunity of writing the Governor on the Subject; for my views on which I refer you to a copy of a letter enclosed- In a communication to you from the Commissioners authorized to treat with the Florida Indians; you were advised of the fact that the treaty was in a measure one of impositionâ€”That the terms were such as policy dictatedâ€”as the prosperity & security of Florida seemed to demandâ€”Concentration within any limits was not agreeable to a population possessing singularly repulsive characteristics- Foreign & nativeâ€”Hostile and submissiveâ€”Refugees from the four Southern tribes and scattered over the whole face of Florida from the Appalachecola to the Capeâ€”To bring together these discordant materials, to reconcile them to the same or any territorial limits was the operation of authority only, to which from their condition they would necessarily yield, but to which they would exhibit opposition so long as it could have any influenceâ€”They finally submitted to the terms of a treaty as the most favourable they could secure for themselves; & to which, by a steady course of undeviating policy, there is no difficulty of ultimately reconciling themâ€”A restlessness of disposition (improperly publickly noted as hostile) has however manifested itself, and which has been principally encouraged under a hope that the arrangements made were not final, but that some more favourable change might be effectedâ€”The injudicious protest against the treaty (dictated it appears in ignorance of facts) on the part of some of the Settlers near the Appalachicolaâ€”The unavoidable delay attending the execution of the treatyâ€”and the unlicenced conversations of designing men with some of the chiefs have all operated to produce the impressions adverted to; but which have in a great measure been dissipated by the running & marking of the boundary linesâ€”The Indians are therefore preparing for a fate which they would silently submit to if deemed unavoidable; but if the most distant encouragement is given they will redouble their efforts to defeat a location in which is involved the prosperity of Floridaâ€”If the Indian population in Florida could be removed to some other country; national policy would approve the measure; but if removal be impracticable the only alternative left is the most judicious location, within proper limits & under such government as to ensure their dependance & disciplineâ€”The least objectionable location is, in my opinion, the one which has been selectedâ€”It is central, cut off from the sea coast, and capable of being in time encircled by a white populationâ€”It is in a part of the territory so situated as not to interpose an Indian population between civilized districtsâ€”The country contains a sufficient quantity of good land for agricultural purposes; in spots sufficiently detached so as to prevent the too great vicinity of villages, objectionable to the savage; the whole encircled with the most extensive grounds alike favourable for hunting & the grazing of cattle, It is a country illy adapted to a white population; but possessing advantages valuable only to a savage, in the uninterrupted enjoyment of which he may rest secure for centuriesâ€”Under this belief as expressed; the sooner the Indians can be advised of their fate, and concentrated within the limits allotted; the sooner, in my opinion, will all apprehensions of hostilities on our southern border vanish; Florida recover from the embarrassments under which she has hitherto laboredâ€”and an enterprising population induced to improve the advantages of her climate & soils, which can alone ensure the national objects for which the purchace from Spain was made * Your Ob Sert JAMES GADSDEN THE HONB.

Since then the suggestion has been confirmed by the order of the Judge requiring the Clerk to transmit to the President copies of all the evidences brought forward to support the charges preferred against me by Rule together with the opinion or judgment rendered by Judge Brackenridge.â€ I have again to express my regret Sir that my duty impels me to trouble the Govt with the detail of proceedings so very unpleasing, & I will add that the only inducement which I can have ever again to address the Departmt upon this affair will be a requisition to produce the evidences which I shall advert to & proffer in the course of this despatch. For I shall rather determine to resign my office ere long, if, conscious of my innocence, and enabled to prove it amply, I am yet to be incessantly harassed with a bitter persecution which altho' it may not impose upon me either disgrace or ruin, is yet sufficient by its dark attacks & continued vexations almost to dispel each gleam of happiness, and (from the peculiar situation of myself & opponents being judicial officers) instead of giving room for any manly redress to denote me to silent anxiety & helpless resentment.â€”It has been well remarked by some writer, that no oppression is so heavy or lasting as that which is inflicted by the perversion & exorbitance of legal authority & truly Sir I have in this matter sadly realized the verity of this observation. I would not without great cause & a sense of imperious duty, & then ever with regret, point to a stain upon the proverbially spotless ermine of the Bench, but Sir I am constrained to say that it will be here fully manifested that the bosom of a Judge is not inaccessible (as it should be) to the fierce feelings of private malignity, but that the most settled enmity has in this instance pervaded official action.â€” That my hitherto unassailed character as a member of the Bar of the highest Courts of three States, as well as of three Federal Courts together with my station, and the consciousness on the part of the Judge, that he himself, & every individual concerned in this matter, were my violent personal enemies, that all this should not have prevented the iniquitous course adopted towards me must doubtless occasion astonishment, & indeed is only to be accounted for by the belief that prudence has with them been blinded by passionâ€”& the fact that a plot in which the Judge has been concerned was long since formed to remove me from office at all hazards, or rather to compel the President so to do, & this fact is here well understoodâ€“ I will premise Sir that the Rule (NÂ° 1)"" was entered during my absence from the Court, without any notice to me whatever, & placed upon the Record not being supported by affidavit or any kind of proof, but upon the simple suggestion of a man of very bad character, whom (as the Judge knew) I had been compelled to prosecute for serious offences. Upon the following morning I moved the court upon several grounds to expunge the Rule from the Record, & among other grounds were the above named, and the additional one, that as under the Judiciary Act of [blank] the District Judges were not allowed to preside in any cause in which they had been of counsel for either party, or were in any way interested * & I then calmly & respectfully submitted to the Court whether this case did not come within the reason of the law, when I stated that I was prepared to prove by the most respectable witnesses the enmity of the presiding Judge to myself, and his friendship for the accuser. An order was instantly entered by command of the Judge (Brackenridge) to imprison me for three hours for a contempt, before the three hours had elapsed, the Marshal came again however to the prison, & required me to accompany him & appear in court, which I declined to do upon a verbal command, & required of him some authorityâ€”& whether any other entry had been made upon the Record than the original order of imprisonmentâ€”the reply being that he had only a verbal order, & that no remission of the imprisonment or any change of the order had been made upon the Record I persisted in my refusal to depart until the expiration of the three hoursâ€”unless some proper authority was shewnâ€”, whereupon I was ordered to be brought by posse which was done, and on being brought into court was fined fifty dollars for contempt in not coming at once from the prison, (to which I had been sent by an order of Record,) and was committed to the Marshal until fine paid which was promptly done by my indignant fellow citizens, I was refused a hearing in my defence (a liberty allowed to the worst criminal elsewhere) & was in short literally gagg'd in court until an immediate adjournment took place. An affidavit for a remission of the fine (NÂ° 2)"" was then for experiment offer'd, which was refused to be filed or considered for a moment by the court. Upon a renewal of the motion to expunge the Rule, the motion was refused to be entered & the Judge merely required the accuser (J L W*) (several days after placing the Rule on Record) to make oath that to the best of his knowledge & belief the changes (not the specifications NÂ° 3)â€ in the Rule were to the best of his knowledge & belief &c, true which he of course readily deposedâ€”and the evidences were accordingly marshalled organized & arrangedâ€”& the testimony has been as I learn (for really I knew so well the result was fixed ere it began that I deemed it folly to strive with this Judge) taken down and prepared in that way which might best subserve their purposes at Washington. I need not here say more with regard to the actors in this business than that they are all close friends & partizans with each other and thorough enemies to myselfâ€”as shall be proved when required. With regard to the Judge Col W"" Barnett's affidavit * heretofore transmitted may be referred to with propriety on this head.â€”I will Sir recur as briefly as possible to the several charges advanced as seen in NÂ° 1 & 2â€”& in relation to the first charge & the two specifications it may be remarked that they are not only utterly false, but suggested & preferred without the knowledge wish or consent of Mr Graham or Mr Hobby who would have disdained to make against me so foul & unfounded an accusation.â€”In the case of Mr Hobbyâ€”about five hundred dollars were collected by me (while practising in Georgia) & the remainder due upon a note placed by Mr H in my hands for collection was never collected but was assumed by me, on account of a leniency shewn to the debtor (a most worthy man) in not bringing suit against him, & I was thus induced to accept securities from him & give a receipt as if for monies received, when in fact I had never received them. Presuming that at the proper moment I should be prepared to account with any client (my pecuniary resources being then ample) I was not in this, nor indeed in other like instances careful as was my duty, to keep seperate my private and professional business, & I was unhappy enough to be rendered unable by sudden & heavy losses to meet the just demands of Mr H and several other clients, but that I even for a moment intended to do them any wrong or injustice is an utter fabrication, & I can refer to the first names in Georgia for the support of this declaration.â€”As to the petty case of Mr Grahamâ€”it is in every respect a more shameless perversion of truth, than almost any of which I could before have conceived. I am prepared to prove whenever necessary that I never act as Attorney in a Justice's court that in this case I acted for a friend of old standing & that he never had the slightest thought of passing blame upon me in any way & on the other hand expressed his obligations for my attention to this business but of all this my persecutors were ignorant or regardless. As to the second charge & the specifications I will observe that the first specif""â€”that of altering the Record by interlining the names of Louis & Manuel is the same which has been already once made to the President, which was as I trust placed in a proper light by the worthy Foreman of the Grand Jury at the term to which the charge refers in his letter heretofore sent to the Department."" Having been since called upon to act as U S Atty upon the Recognizance taken against myself for the above act, to which Recognizâ€ I was ordered by the individual accuser J L Williams acting as Justiceâ€”I moved the court to appoint a publick prosecutor pro hac vice, which was (with much apparent reluctance) declined, inasmuch as the publick indignation on this subject was quite manifest & the witnesses were then at my request sent by the Court itself before the Grand Jury at the late May Term (of which body Mr Twitchell was also Foreman) who promptly rejected the chargeâ€”and yet after this the Judge aware of the constitutional tribunal of the country having passed upon it & knowing that this very charge had been ineffectually made & was spurned as an infamous fiction by every honorable man in this community proceeded to hear evidence on this matter & to intimate his opinion that the Attorney of the U States had in this matter committed forgery. In this & others of the charges which assert the commission of offenses by the writerâ€”it will be seen that the Judge has utterly disregarded the right of trial by jury & taken the law into his own hands ""I need hardly remark that evidence of a more settled resolve to use all the force of official power to effect unmerited and wanton injury & cause injustice could scarcely be adduced in human annals. I beleive with sincerity that there was no man who heard this proceedure but who was impelled from honest impulse to ejaculate as well in this instance as at the time of the imposition of the fine of fifty dollars. â€œGrossius hac Rhadamanthus habet durissima regnaâ€â€”As to the four additional specifications made they are alike shameful untruths without the shadow of foundation. In respect to alterations of Indictments I have ever exercised my official discretion under the laws with integrity and have never in any instance illegally changed the form of any indictment as any honorable man who knows me will beleive. As to the third charge and the specification under itâ€”it becomes only necessary to say that I am and ever have been incapable of such an act & that the deposition of M"" Scott can be at any time obtained to prove the utter falsity of this accusation. In reference to the fourth charge &c it may be remarked that the charge is the same heretofore preferred against me before the President, and that in each case cited I shall be fully enabled to prove whenever it is required that good grounds for prosecution existed that indeed prosecutions were well deserved. For the fifth charge & fourth specification a deposition can at any time be filed to prove that every material fact was correctly stated in the News paper Publication "" there spoken of that it was in self defence & in answer to a most wicked & wanton attack made upon me in a publication in a preceding paper in which last communication was contained an intemperate & personal opinion of the Judge pronounced against me in Court & which scarcely could be called a legal opinionâ€”The second specification &c as to a pretended Law report will more properly be the subject of a separate communication * having been acted upon by a separate rule against me, altho' in the first instance embodied in the chargeâ€”The third & fourth specifications under the 5"" charge relate to matters which as well as the others are replied to in the answer (NÂ° 4)* filed in Court.â€”In reference to the conversation at the Commercial Hotel which respected the private deportment of H. M. Breckenridge as a Citizen generallyâ€”and as respected the Speaker (W. F. Steele) specially, it was spoken of in terms of great severityâ€”but as was beleived with a severity not unmerited by his dishonorable & unprincipled deportment as an Individual, and even as a Judge to wound a man who had never ijured himâ€”but the term court or aught like it was never mentioned. And indeed it is a unique case that for such a conversation a contempt should be allegedâ€”As to the fourth specification by adverting in argument on the motion to expunge the rule &c to the Judiciary Act this has been before discussed and is more fully shewn in the answer (NÂ° 4) before namedâ€”After the evidence had been closed & my answer had been heard I stated to the Court that I was prepared to make an affidavit if required that every material fact should be disproved by evidence at the next term if a decision upon the rule was postponed until that time. Upon discovering however that it was resolved by the court to make a final decision at all hazards and indeed that any thing I could say had I possessed the tongue of an Angel would not avail me. I desisted and the Judge then pronounced an opinion the most oblique & untrue which I have ever heard from a Judge & more clearly indicative of malicious feeling than I had supposed even this Judge would venture which opinion was accompanied 41 Ante, p. 875. 42 Post, p. 981. with a sentence as annexed (NÂ° 5.)* The determination of Judge B. was as I have no doubt when the rule was entered to order my removal as U. S. Attorney &câ€”as well as in the capacity of a private practitioner but the enormity of this attempt after they beleived the failure of the same attempt already made at Washington was too palpable and the public displeasure being somewhat evident on this account they desistedâ€”I use the term â€œtheyâ€ in this matter Sir, because it is at this time evident to all candid men here & is I beleive entirely susceptible of proofâ€”that H. M. Breckenridge, J. M. White, John Innerarity, John Miller, William Sebree, John L. Williams, Henry Grandpre, W"" H. Huntâ€”N. S. Parmentierâ€”and a number of minor personages whom I have found it my duty to prosecute in the course of my official progressâ€”are formed as a combination to destroy me in any manner however indefensible. Were it necessary Sir I could readily adduce proofs of the utter destitution of principle & almost infamy of character of most of the members of this leagueâ€”As to the style & the matter of the opinion which is as I suppose by this time transmitted to the department of Stateâ€”I cannot bring myself to comment upon it specially least I should purchance forget that calmness which is due to the authority to which I address myselfâ€”Yet I cannot deem it my duty to avoid altogether the notice of some few points in the opinion which are such wide departures from the verity of the case, and which proceeding from such a source as that of an U. S. Dist. Judge might unexplained carry some small authority. In several instances the Judge alludes to my deportment in Court which he asserts has been often insulting & offensive, whereas I shall be able fully to prove that my manner altho' ardent has never been as statedâ€”and that altho' ardent has never been as statedâ€”and that althoâ€™ I had a perfect knowledge of the Judge's devoted enmity & of all those he could influence I have yet always acted to him with professional courtesy. It is susceptible of proof that I have been frequently prevented from arguing a case for my publick or private Clientsâ€”& been commanded to silence without the slightest reason, and when I have respectfully asserted my rights and demanded to be heard have been either threatened with imprisonment or actually imprisoned.â€” The assertion of the Judge in the Opinion that he is not nor has been ever my enemy &câ€”when contrasted with the affidavit of Col. Barnet before named and with his declaration in the said opinion that it is very natural he should be my indignant enemy on account of my conduct to him must really excite astonishment when it is known that numerous affidavits of the most respectable Witnesses could be adduced to prove his devoted hostilityâ€”As to the numerous wicked suggestions of his belief against me contained in the Opinion of my running as he terms it before Mayor's, Justices &câ€”to insure the emoluments of office &câ€”of my having never denied the correctness of the charge against me in the case of Graham &câ€”of my conduct in Mr. Hobby's case & my denial of the debt on the receipt of money & of the groundlessness of many prosecutions instituted by me against J. L. Williams & othersâ€”of my inducing M"" Scott to act improperlyâ€” of my asserting that I should file information because the Grand Jury refused to find Bills &câ€”and many other assertions made in the Opinionâ€”I can only remark, with due deference to the departmentâ€”that I solemnly declare them to be the most unfounded & iniquitous misrepresentations & undue suggestions thro' out which could have been devised by the most perverse maliceâ€”I will merely remark as to the comments of the Judge in the part of the opinion relating to the alleged alteration of the Record in the case of the Coulons before spoken ofâ€”in which the words Manuel & Louis were inserted & to which the letter of the Foreman T. Twitchell Esq. heretofore sent had relation *â€”I must declare that I have been shocked at the utter destitution of correctness & feeling in this part of the opinionâ€”where the Judge could remark â€œthat the refusal of the Grand Jury (whose Foreman M* Twitchell was Foreman also at the last term &c.) to find against me ought after they had fully examined the case at my requestâ€”was no evidence of innocenceâ€”&c that this was my doctrine &câ€â€”I must believe that this circumstance alone will stamp the character of his conduct to meâ€”and will shew with what candor or honor the opinion is delivered in other respects as well as thisâ€”It is notorious (& the Judge knew it) that in regard to this plot got up between John Innerarity (brother in law of the Coulons) & Mr. J. L. Williams (the magistrate who recognized me) to charge me with forgery in defacing an Indictment by inserting the words Manuel & Louis it is notorious that every honest man in this community has viewed & still views it as one of the most shocking and infamous attempts to pervert the laws to the injury of an Individual which has ever been developedâ€”And as to the Judge's intimacy with this M. J. L. Williams and partiality for him it is here well known.â€” In conclusion Sir I will observe that I shall when required send such evidences as it may be intimated and necessary but shall otherwise omit to address the department again on this subject and shall endeavor in the earnest discharge of my official duties as usual to forget that base conspiracy which has been so earnestly directed against meâ€”I can safely say Sir that I care less for the office (which is by no means so valuable as to induce me to forego all happiness by a long retention of it after their plans are defeated, amid a circle of Lynx eyed and tyger hearted enemies) than is my care for the honor of my Country in seeing a base conspiracy of bad men effect by wicked ingenuityâ€”the unmerited prostration of an officer of Government who is to them obnoxiousâ€”I shall rest Sir contented to await any advices on this subject from Washington, and shall only request (if deemed necessary) that this communication be laid before the President of the U. States. I had intended at this time to give a history of my most illegal fine & imprisonment for publishing a true account of the proceedings of Judge B. in a matter at the last term but I will take leave Sir to postpone it until the ensuing week when I will make a brief communication on the subject * I have the honor to be Sir, With the highest consideration Very respectfully Your ob"" hble Servant WILLIAM F STEELE Atty of the U States &c HON.

"NA:WD, QMG Letters Recd.:ALS",Correspondence,DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,DANIEL E. BURCH,THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL,"GENERAL, Private claims for some of the grounds which have been heretofore considered as in the possession of the military, particularly the scite of the old Barracks & a small Battery in Pensacola, having been filed before the land Commissioners for West Florida now in Session in this City, I request, if such a document be in your office, you will be pleased to furnish me with it, in order that I may know what public buildings or lots were turned over by the Spanish authorities when Gen' Jackson received possession of the province. Capt. Thornton ""informs me that Major Staunton "" did not furnish him with a copy when he left the Station, hence there is none on file in this Office. A list of this property it is understood was lodged in the Office of the Secretary of State for the Territory, or in the Mayor's Office of the City, but it is now either lost or mislaid. The original I presume is in the Office of the Secretary of State at Washington. If a copy of that however is not to be procured, & Major Staunton should not have forwarded one to your office, I think it probable he may yet have it in his possession.â€” On the subject of public buildings in Pensacola, I beg leave to represent for your information, that the blockhouses now occupied as Storehouses are all situated in the streets of the City, and that two of them occupy positions in the centre of one of the principal streets, to the injury & inconvenience of persons owning lots & living immediately in the rear of them. During the winter the City authorities requested of me to abandon these, but afterwards withdrew the application, supposing something would be done in Congress relative to the public lots & buildings in the City.â€”I would therefore respectfully suggest the propriety & expediency of abandoning these two to the City Authorities, provided they will remove them at their expense, and reserving such part of the materials of which they are built as may be of use in the Quartermaster's Department; & that the buildings on the Hospital lot be repaired for Storehouses,â€”with Soldiers as carpenters it can be done at a comparatively small expense. This lot & buildings ought, in my opinion, to be retained in any event, by the Government, for Storehouses, as it is more conveniently situated as it regards business than any other public or even private lot in the City. It is considered the most valuable lot in the City, by every person, for any kind of mercantile business. There is one Blockhouse standing apart near the Shore at the upper end of the City occupied by me as a Storehouse, the one occupied as a custom house, and also the Government house, which do not interfere in the least with the convenience of any one on the arrangement of the City;â€”I would recommend therefore, that they continue to be appropriated for their present purposes.â€â€” I have the honor to be Sir, with perfect respect Y' Mo.
