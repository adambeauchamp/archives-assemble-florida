INDEX NOTE
In compiling the list of names of persons for this index, deficiencies in spelling
found in the text have been corrected, in so far as sources now available permit,
and variants found throughout the text have been assembled in parentheses. The
nearly illegible character of the handwriting in some instances, which leaves the
reader in doubt as to the writer's intent, and the obvious ignorance, or careless-
ness, often displayed by the signatories account for many variations in orthog-
raphy. With respect to the signers of petitions, like names, with identical spell-
ing, are also frequently attached to successive documents on related subjects from
the same locality; yet a comparison of the handwriting discloses occasional impor-
tant differences. In such instances separate entries have been made in the index,
though the reader is warned that names were often written in by hands other than
the subscribers’; finality in this regard cannot therefore be established in every
case. On the other hand the fact that the same name is variously spelled in
sequential documents does not argue against identity of person, which is likewise
disclosed by a comparison of handwriting as well as by such other tests as docu-
ments of legal record, genealogical data, and whatever knowledge of the various
residences of a given person may be derived from the papers embodied in the
present volume. But whenever there is doubt as to such identity a separate
entry has been made. In some instances the index material is organized according
to office or function under a duplication of the principal entry (see DuVal, Wil-
liam P.).
Names of English origin have been listed in the index as written (if the signature
was not by mark); but Spanish names, which appear in the text written phonet-
ically, with much variation, have been entered in the index under the forms com-
monly used in available sources, followed by their variants in parentheses.
