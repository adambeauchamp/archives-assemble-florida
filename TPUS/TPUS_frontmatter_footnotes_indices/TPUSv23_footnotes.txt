I recd the communications to which it related from Governor Duval of Florida; the papers came to me on the 24** and, the same day, were, according to your direction, handed to Mr Jones, the ch. clerk of the Treasury Department, with a note stating that it was done by your direction, and with reference to orders which you had given or intended to give as to the employment of the revenue-Cutters on the coast of Florida.-On the same day, also, I wrote to Mr Steele, the U. S. Attorney for West. Florida, stating my doubts as to the regularity of a military arrest of the wood. cutters, under the governor's warrant, and requested that he wº be pleased to apprize me of the reasons which had rendered it necessary to adopt that form of proceeding, in preference to the mode of arrest pointed out by the 33 S. of the Judiciary act. My letter is perfectly respectful and merely a call for information— though my present impression is that the Governor's movement, well intended as it certainly was, was better suited to the former political meridian of Florida than the present.—So much for the wood. cutters.”—(LC, Monroe Papers, vol. 33).

Gadsden was notified by McKenney on Aug. 26 of the President's approval of the extension of the northern and eastern boundaries of the Indian reservation (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 1). In acknowledging the notification, Sept. 2, 1824, Gadsden stated that he would return to Florida to complete the survey (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.).

A copy of the contract was enclosed and is printed ibid., pp. 622–623. “The Indians in this quarter have some violent quarrels among themselves; and, lately, two towns fought with clubs and knives, and several of them are maimed and severely beaten. I have interposed my authority to prevent open and deadly war among them and expect to make them settle their dispute, and abide by the opinion of their steady old chiefs. Between the settlers and the Indians I have been constantly engaged in preserving order, whenever my health would permit. The duties which I have performed, and the exposure to the hot sun and rain in a wilderness such as this, have seriously injured my constitution. I have, for several weeks, been wholly unable to quit my cabin, and much of the time confined to my bed. I mention this as my apology for not writing more fully to you on the subject of the contracts I have made. . . . The want of the services of the agent, or any one to assist me, has imposed heavy duties on me, and engrossed the whole of my time. The $6,000 which, by the treaty, was to be laid out in purchase of stock, cattle, &c, as well as the $1,000 for a gunsmith and his tools, $2,000 for transportation, and the $4,500 to be given for compensation for Indian improvements, will be wanted as early as possible; the $6,000 for the purchase of stock cattle is not a part of the annuity, as I understand the treaty. It will be enough to remit the annuity some time hence.” This letter was answered post, p. 83.

* Answered Sept. 12, 1824, NA (WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File), containing a routine report relative to the construction of Cant. Brooke. The concluding paragraph respecting roads is of interest. “I observe that Congress, during its last session, has directed a survey of a road, from Tampa Bay to intersect, the road, from Pensacola, to St. Augustine; and the survey of roads from Cape Sable and Florida Point. These two latter roads, can never be of any service, as they probably will not be travelled, and will require every two, or three years to be cut out anew. I would also observe, that 16 feet, is sufficiently wide for any road, and that making it 25, is a vast increase of labor, added to, a disadvantage. I shall do myself the honor, to write you upon this subject, more fully in a few days.” This he did on Nov. 5, 1824 (loc. cit.), but added little to what he emphasized in the foregoing language.

Its nature, however, may be gleaned from the statement of his account (post, p. 101), and from the schedule of payments made to the towns and their chiefs (post, p. 102). In McKenney to the Secretary of War, Dec. 2, 1824 (NA, loc. cit.), a requisition for DuVal in the sum of $4,500 was requested to compensate the Florida Indians for their improvements.

The removal of Steele was urged by Sen. Richard M. Johnson, of Ky., who presented to the Secretary of State a bundle of papers against Steele (Memoirs J. Q. Adams, vi, 235, 240). He was replaced (post, p. 213). His last salary account covers the period from Jan. 6 to Mar. 8, 1825, and refers to him as the “late attorney” for West Florida (NA, GAO, Misc. Treas. Acct.

* Dated Dec. 11, 1824 (Fla., Acts, 1824, pp. 158–161). Sect. 1 of this act gave to the site selected for the seat of government the name of Tallahassee. This region had once been the home of the Apalachee Indians, a tribe which had been exterminated during the wars of the 18th century or had migrated to Louisiana where the survivors disappeared. An Indian name meaning “Old Town,” Tallahassee had also been the site of San Luis de Talimali, the principal Spanish mission center. The act provided for the laying off of the town by a surveyor to be appointed by the Governor, who was also authorized to appoint three commissioners to conduct the sale of lots and to contract for the erection of public buildings. See statement by Gov. DuVal, Aug. 3, 1824 (Thomas, Archs. Fla., p. 153), explaining the selection of the site for the capital as being in the center of the richest land in the territory.

He submitted the matter to the Secretary of War on Aug. 6, 1826, claiming that he was owed $31,025.82 for rations, and that he had applied unsuccessfully to Gov. DuVal for payment; he further stated that $5,205 was due him for cattle furnished to the Indians (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.). In response to a request from McKenney of Oct. 23 for an explanation, the Governor communicated on Nov. 15 that the matter had been attended to by the Secretary during his absence in 1825, and that the accounts had been taken by him to Washington (loc. cit.).

This report has not been found in the records of either the House or the General Land Office. The act of Congress approved Apr. 22, 1826, confirmed the decisions of the land commissioners for West Florida forwarded in reports, abstracts, and opinions after Jan. 1, 1825, upon which date the Board expired by law (4 STAT. 156). Overton and Call submitted a report on July 18, 1825, which is found in the untitled vol. 26 mentioned above, and which is printed in H. Doc. 18, 19 Cong., 1 sess., and in A. S. P., op. cit., p. 446.

On Mar. 9 is entered a further nomination of Claggett for the same position and an order that it lie on the table (ibid., p. 447). Since the commission was recorded, his nomination was evidently regarded as confirmed. Neither the transmittal letter nor an acknowledgement has been found. That he served in the position is shown by salary payments authorized by the First Auditor of the Treasury for the quarter from Mar. 9 to June 8 and from June 9 to Sept. 8, 1825 (NA, GAO, Misc. Treas. Accts., Nos. 49046, 49272). See post, p. 349. 7 Various applications and recommendations relative to this position had also been received. Sen. Richard M. Johnson (Ky.) recommended Samuel R. Overton (Memoirs of J. Q. Adams, VI, 284, Apr. 8, 1824), and in an undated letter to the Sec. of State recommended John Overton and Craven P. Luckett (NA, SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, XI).

Besides displaying the physical features of the country, as prescribed by the surveying regulations, they present valuable information relative to the names of settlers, the locations of tracts, the routes of roads, and the location of forts. Filed with the pertinent township plats are diagrams of surveys of private land claims.

* See White to the Secretary of War, Nov. 28, 1825 (NA, WD, CE Lets. Recd., W 965), proposing the survey for a canal from Waccasassa Bay, below the mouth of the Suwannee River, to St. Johns River. Such a canal, it was contended, would facilitate the commerce of the Mississippi Valley and the southern states with the eastern seaboard and promote settlement and the sale of public lands. This was answered Nov. 29, 1825 (loc. cit., Lets. Issued Inter. Improvts.), that the views presented were of high interest, but that an inspection of the proposed route was not possible with the means and personnel at hand. White's letter was printed contemporaneously in the Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser, Dec. 31, 1825, as well as in S. Doc. 21, 19 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 8–21, S.

But, he suggested, the Indians were evidently starving. Since the Indian agent had lost his influence, force has become necessary, and that the treaty could be enforced with 200 regular troops. He urges the establishment of a military post on the southern frontier of Alachua, 93 No reply found. On Dec. 28, 1825, a petition by Reuben Charles was presented to the House by Del.

* Not present. This, or some other article in that newspaper, elicited from the Pensacola Gazette & W. Fla. Advertiser, Sept. 22, 1826, the following editorial: “The Militia.--We observe that our brethren of East Florida, are agitating in the Herald the question, why is not the Militia of our Territory properly organized, mustered and exercised? This question with equal propriety might be asked here—but who shall ask it? The people will not, for mustering is almost always done with reluctance. Are there not officers, who have sworn correctly to perform the duties of of their offices, whose duty it is to see into this matter? We think there are; we have for these three years had a General, Colonels, Majors and Captains of Militia but we have never seen or heard of the privates who compose the Brigades, Divisions, Regiments and Companies of their commands. If the Militia laws are salutary, it is time they were attended to—if they are not, let them be repealed. It is worse than ridiculous to have laws in our statute book, which are a dead letter and only serve to add to the importance of some individuals, by giving them imposing titles. We have lately observed in the South Carolina papers, the trial, condemnation & sentence of a Militia officer, for neglect of duty; but in this Territory, were Justice in this respect attempted, there would be none left unimpeached of whom to form a Court, nor even an officer to order it to be held—from the Commander in chief down, not one, we believe, has done his duty! We speak with regard to the Militia of this County— further we are not informed. “We copy into this paper, an account of the formation of a Volunteer Militia Company in St. Augustine, under the name of the “Florida Rangers.”—We think that Volunteer Companies excite a spirit of emulation productive of a handsome appearance in the Militia and are therefore pleased that the plan has been adopted.” The account of the Florida Rangers mentioned above appeared in the E.

Woolsey, May 1, 1827 (NA, ND, SN Lets. to Officers of Ships of War, Bk. 17), to plant live oak seedlings on the naval reserve at Pensacola. Elias Wallen and William R. Taber informed the Board of Navy Commissioners, May 8, 1827 (loc. cit., Bd. Navy Commrs., Misc. Lets. Recd.), that they would not be able to deliver live oak timber according to their agreement; they were given a new contract, July 1, 1827 (loc. cit., Contracts, Bk. 5). And, finally, Charles Haire was appointed agent to investigate and mark live oak areas in West Fla., Nov. 12, 1827 (loc. cit., SN Lets. of Appointment), informed of his duties by the Secretary on the same day (loc. cit., General Let. Bk. 16), and accepted, Jan. 8, 1828 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Recd.). See post, p. 1064, n.

32 Hunt offered a reward of $20 in the Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser, Oct. 13, 1827, for the arrest of Martin Hutto, who had escaped confinement on a charge of attacking a mail carrier. The Nov. 9 issue of the same newspaper contained a note stating that Hutto had been retaken and imprisoned in Cantonment Clinch to await trial. But he escaped again on Jan. 23, 1828, and another reward was advertised on the 25th of that month. The following piece from the July 27th issue of the same newspaper apparently concerns the attack in question: “Caution to Mail Riders.-On the 14th instant the rider, who carries the Tallahassee Mail between Alaqua and Pensacola, Thomas G. Jones, was attacked by two Desperadoes, about three miles East of Yellow Water Post Office. One of the villains discharged a rifle at him, the ball of which passed through his hat, within an inch of his head; the other immediately made at him with a large Spanish dirk knife, with which he attempted to stab him, but fortunately only cut through his clothes. Mr. Jones made his escape with the Mail. Mail carriers ought always to be well armed, and able to protect the Mail in case of attack. We are happy to state that we have been informed, that one of the above mentioned wretches has been identified, and that suspicion has rested upon another; both of whom will probably be apprehended and committed for trial. If the offenders are not already taken, it is highly desirable that the inhabitants of the country, in the neighborhood of which they have been seen, should promptly turn out and assist in discovering and arresting them.” Hutto escaped again in June 1828, following his conviction, and on June 23 a reward of $50 was offered for his capture.
