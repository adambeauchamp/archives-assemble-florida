This letter contains an endorsement by President Jackson, Dec. 10, 1830, making the reservation. Commissioner Hayward of the General Land Office had returned all papers pertaining to the reservation to the Secretary of War, Dec. 4, 1830 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 2), as there was no order by the President included. On Dec. 10, 1830 (loc. cit.), he cautioned the President that the land in the vicinity of Cantonment Brooke had not been surveyed by his office and preemptions under the law of May 29, 1830 (4 STAT. 420–421), could exist on it. Hayward instructed Butler at the same time (NA, GLO, Lets. to SG, IV), to make the reservation ordered when his surveyors should reach the area.

* This commission was delivered at Washington; see post, p. 236. Dean succeeded Wilson who was informed of his displacement, July 8, 1829 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., XXIII). From Pensacola Wilson wrote to the Secretary of State, Dec. 7, 1829 (loc. cit., Applications), enclosing testimonials (not present) and claiming injustice had been done in removing him. On the same day (loc. cit.) he informed the President that he had gone to Key West to collect documents to prove that the charges against him were false and malicious. He applied for the consulate at Havre, France. After unsuccessful attempts to see the Secretary of State in Washington the following March, Wilson appealed to him, Mar. 29, 1830 (loc. cit.), for public employment and on June 29, 1830 (loc. cit.), applied for the consulate at Vera Cruz.

Everett, American minister in Spain, June 16, with instructions to obtain the material requested by the Secretary of the Treasury (NA, SD, Instructions to Ministers, XII). Concerning the effort to obtain copies from Spain, see post, p. 416, n. An examination of the correspondence files of both the State Department and of the American Embassy in London produced no letters to show that the American Minister there obtained and sent to Washington copies of the Indian treaties. The explanation may be that Del. White had already written to the legation to request these same documents, for he wrote to Thomas Douglas, Nov. 8, 1829 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.), stating that he would send him copies of the treaties which he had obtained in an authentic manner. Texts of several Indian treaties or extracts therefrom appear in White, New Coll.

Graham informed Call, Aug. 19, 1829 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 24), relative to the instructions to Barbour (see ante, p. 236, n.), and enquired if a land sale at Tallahassee in Dec. or Jan. would interfere with his court duties. Previously (July 10, 1829; loc. cit.) Graham had suggested that Call ascertain what original papers would be needed by the district attorneys for cases in their districts. Call answered, July 26, 1829 (loc. cit., Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee), that he would write to the attorneys and make his visit to Cuba after the sickly SeaSon.

The proceedings contain supplementary material on Burch's activities in Florida. In a letter to the Quartermaster General, Aug. 25, 1829 (loc. cit., QMG Consolidated Corr.

Phagan's bond was received in May and his commission was transmitted in June (McKenney to DuVal, May 27, and June 10, 1830, NA, OIA Lets. Sent, Bk. 6).

* Acknowledged July 13, 1830 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.). Humphreys, who was thus displaced, petitioned the House of Representatives in 1831 (House Journal, Dec. 12, 1831, 22 Cong., 1 sess., p. 33; petition not found), for indemnification for losses sustained as a result of having to surrender his lands and improvements to the Seminole. The House Committee on Private Land Claims did not consider him entitled to compensation, since there was a difference of opinion as to the cost of clearing land and the buildings had been built at government expense without his informing his superiors that they were placed on his land (NA, HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.). Pursuant to a Senate resolution of Jan. 14, 1835 (Senate Journal, 23 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 92–93), the Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, was instructed on Mar. 21, 1835 (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 15), to investigate Humphreys’ claim. Thompson's report, with supporting documents, submitted July 9, 1835 (loc. cit., Lets. Recd., Seminole), showed that the tract of land purchased by Humphreys from Antonio Alvarez was at a different location than the Indian agency and that the buildings there had been constructed at government expense. Therefore there was no basis for the claim.
