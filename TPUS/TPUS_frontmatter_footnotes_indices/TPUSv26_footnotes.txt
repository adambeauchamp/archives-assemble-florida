Recd., A 56), that should he be called upon for a return of the militia under the command of Leigh Read he would not be able to furnish it, as the required monthly returns had never been made. See also the Paymaster General to the Secretary of War, Mar. 11, 1841 (loc. cit., P124), advising that no appropriation for the militia in Florida had been made during the present or past year, and recommending that they be discharged as soon as their service can be dispensed with. Charges of fraud in the accounts arising in the militia service in Florida were made, and a board of officers was appointed to investigate the accounts. See Henry Stanton to the Secretary of War, Feb. 28, 1841 (loc. cit., S392), and F. S. Dancy to id., Mar. 28, 1841 (loc. cit., D 81). See also act approved Aug. 23, 1842 (5 STAT. 522), for the settlement, after adjustment, of the claims of Florida militia called into the service by the War Department in 1839 and 1840 for pay, subsistence and other items; the appropriation in question totaled $166,242.20. See in this connection, the report of the Committee on Military Affairs, July 1, 1842, entitled “Pay of the Florida Militia” (Rep. 893, 27 Cong., 2 sess.), which provided the basis of the act in question. In H. Exec. Doc. 247, 27 Cong., 2 sess., is a memorandum of the Adjutant General, June 3, 1842, embodying the number of regular army troops engaged in Florida from March 1841 to March 1842, and the members of Florida militia men in the service of the United States from March 1, 1841, to May 31, 1841. There is also a statement of the number of Georgia militia men in service in October and December 1841.
