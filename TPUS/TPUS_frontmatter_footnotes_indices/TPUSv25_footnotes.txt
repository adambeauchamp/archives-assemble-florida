* Answered Apr. 19, 1835 (NA, WD, CE. Lets.

By means of the Rail Road, (the distance being only twenty three miles) the two points would be brought very close together—So that the business of trade as well as the Collection of the Customs could be transacted with every facility at Tallahassee. “In conclusion I would recommend that if the Government determine to abandon Fort St Marks and dependencies as a position for defence—a grant should be made to the Rail Road Company of Ten Acres of land at the confluence of the St Marks and Waculla Rivers reserving all that portion of it embraced by the walls of the Old Fort, and by all the public buildings now standing in the site, reserving also the right of way to the said reservation. The limits of the reservation to be defined by commencing at a point on the Waculla River where the walls of the Fort touch the same River and following the foot of the said walls to the Eastern corner of the Bomb proof Building following along that building at the Eastern and Southern front to its Western corner, and thence following a West line to the River Waculla. This reservation to be held by the United States until the effects of the Rail Road are ascertained—when, should it be found necessary to occupy the said reservation for the use of the Custom House &C the same to remain in possession of the U States and a quantity of land equal to the quantity of the reservation to be given to the Rail Road Company in order to make up the full complement of the Grant made by Congress of Ten Acres of land—Should it be decided on the contrary to establish a Port of Entry at some more healthy and equally convenient point as at Tallahassee then the said reservation to be given up to the Rail Road Company.” The Chief Engineer replied May 5, 1835 (loc. cit., Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 5), approving his proposals.

* Among the duties of the territorial secretary as prescribed by the Ordnance of 1787 (the Northwest Ordnance), and repeated in the laws establishing subsequent territories (see act establishing Florida Territory, ante, vol. XXII, 391), was to “record and preserve all the papers and proceedings of the executive, and all the acts of the Governor and legislative council, and transmit authentic copies of the proceedings of the governor, in his Executive Department, every six months to the President of the United States”. These journals, as kept by the various secretaries in the different territories, followed no consistent pattern either of arrangement or content. A few contained lists of appointments and copies of official documents, such as correspondence, proclamations and orders. Examples of this type are represented in Territorial Papers, III (N.W. Terr.), 263–535; x (Mich.), 713–733; x1 (Mich.), 76–101; xv (Mo.), 37–47, 187–196; xvii (Ill.), 619– 672. Others contained only lists of appointments, as ibid., XIX (Ark.), 789–814. With respect to the Territory of Florida, the originals of its Journals of Executive Proceedings have disappeared (if they existed-there being no evidence of their receipt by the Federal Government); and no one of them has been printed. But there is a copy each of three of the journals present in NA (SD) covering the following periods: January 1, 1835–July 1, 1835 (here printed), August 28, 1835–January 30, 1836 (post, p. 286), and January 10, 1840—June 23, 1840 (post, XXVI).

Genl.), the Attorney General advised that a public war, within the Constitution and the rules and articles of war, had existed with the Seminoles since the day Congress had noted their hostilities and appropriated money to suppress them. On Jan. 14, 1836, Congress voted $120,000 for the suppression of the Seminoles; on Jan. 29, 1836, the sum of $500,000 was appropriated; on Apr. 1, 1836, a like sum was made available; and on Apr. 29, 1836, $1,000,000 was appropriated (5 STAT.1, 8, 17). During the period July 2, 1836-Mar. 3, 1839, a total of 16 million dollars was made available for the protection of the frontier, including the Florida area, against Indian attacks.
