* Documents presented in Part One have relevance, in the main, to the civil and military occupation of the provinces of East Florida and West Florida subsequent to the treaty of cession of 1819. The first documents here reproduced, embodying a recommendation for appointments in the proposed new government of Florida, are dated a few days prior to the exchange of ratifications of the Spanish treaty. It was known in Washington of course early in 1821 that the Floridas would shortly become an integral part of the United States and that both an interim administration and a permanent territorial government would successively follow the exchange of ratifications. During 1819 and 1820, when expectation was high that the cession in question would be consummated at an early date, many persons were recommended for office—names being proposed for the offices of Governor, Secretary, Judges, Collectors et cetera. Some of the names proposed were those of men of local prominence, such as the Governors of Maine and North Carolina, Nathaniel Ware, a former Secretary of the territories of Mississippi and Alabama, and William S. Fulton, who was to become in later years successively Secretary and Governor of Arkansas Territory. But only one person out of the many recommended in 1819 and 1820 received an appointment: William G. D. Worthington, of Maryland, for whom see post p. 35, n.
* Other recommendations on behalf of DuVal as judge are in NA (SD, Applications). Rep. Thomas Montgomery (Ky.) wrote the President, Feb. 16, 1821, stating he had received a letter from DuVal expressing an interest in an appointment as governor or judge. Sen. Ninian Edwards (Ill.) recommended DuVal for a judicial appointment in a letter to the Secretary of State, Feb. 21, 1821. See also post p. 42. 3

* William Pope DuVal (1784–1854), a native of Virginia, was of French Huguenot forbears. He left home while still a youth and lived for more than two years as a frontiersman in Kentucky. At the age of 18 he began the study of law at Bardstown, being admitted to the bar two years later. During the War of 1812 he served in Indiana as a captain of mounted rangers. He was a Representative in Congress from Kentucky, 1813–1815, returning at the end of the term to the practice of law at Bardstown. Appointed judge in East Florida (post, p. 42), he served at St. Augustine for about a month in Nov.-Dec., 1821. He undertook a trip to Washington partly at public request to act as unofficial delegate and was successful in obtaining Congressional support of his appointment as Governor (post, p. 469). See James O. Knauss, “William Pope DuVal, Pioneer and State Builder” (Fla. Hist. Quar., XI (Jan. 1933]), pp. 95–139, and Dict. Amer. Biog., v, 557–558, art. by Knauss. DuVal uniformly signed himself as “DuVal” though his name usually appears in print as “Duval.”
* A Senator of the United States from Georgia.
* The other persons, all from Augusta, Ga., recommended in this communication to the President by Walker and Reid, on Feb. 17, 1821, were as follows: Joseph Hutchinson as receiver of public moneys, Peter Boisclair as marshal, John Kinney, Jr., as collector at Pensacola, Thomas F. Wells as attorney general, and John Gindrat as postmaster at Pensacola (NA, SD, Applications).

* The legislative history of this act may be found in House Journal, 16 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 282,300, 303, 319, 320, 323, 324, 327; Senate Journal, 16 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 226, 253, 271. No debate is reported in Annals of Congress. Cf. similar act approved Oct. 31, 1803 (Terr. Papers, Orleans, Ix, 89–90). An earlier act, approved Mar. 3, 1819 (3 STAT. 523-524), had been inoperative because of the long delay of Spain in confirming the treaty and in effecting an agreement with the United States respecting an exchange of ratifications. A provision of the treaty of cession prescribed a period of six months from date of signature within which affirmations by the respective parties should take place. For the United States, the Senate acted on Feb. 25, 1819 (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 177). But Spain hesitated until and beyond the expiration of the date fixed for the completion of the transaction (exchange of ratifications). In this connection it was believed by the administration in Washington that Spain's reluctance was due to the American contention that the three large land grants made by the King to Alagon, Pufionrostro, and Vargas, respectively, should be invalidated. In the end the American fear in this regard was groundless. Actually, the delay was due to two factors: (1) Spain's desire to secure an assurance from the United States that she would not extend recognition to the new South American republics (a condition which the United States rejected), and (2) the unfortunate appointment of John Forsyth as U. S. Minister to Spain in 1819 with instructions to urge early action on the treaty. But Forsyth's tactics were crude and his language insulting, and he was thus totally ineffective. The friendly intervention of France, however, paved the way for ratification, as well as for the exchange of ratifications in Washington on Feb. 22, 1821, exactly two years after the signing of the treaty. See comprehensive explanatory and interpretative notes relative to the text of the treaty, its negotiation, signing, ratification and exchange of ratifications, by Miller (ed.), op. cit., pp. 31–64. See also Niles’ Reg., XX, 39–42, and A. S. P., For. Rels., V, 127-132 respecting the exchange. The treaty was proclaimed by the President Feb. 22, 1821. ”See commissions of Andrew Jackson, post, pp. 9, 18.

* The portion of section 2 to this point is virtually identical with section 2 of the act pertaining to the occupation of Louisiana (Terr. Papers, Orleans, IX, 90). The administration understood the above provision to mean that the local laws of the area in question should remain in force until changed by the Congress, which was in accordance with historical precedent. See ibid., p. 90, n., containing a citation to the case of Campbell v. Hall, relating to the status of Grenada and the decision of Lord Mansfield, as well as other pertinent references.

*See supra (sec. 1). " Jackson had been offered the appointment in 1819, at a time when it was believed early ratification of the treaty of cession would be made by Spain, but he declined. The President renewed the offer in a letter of Jan. 24, 1821, and Jackson replied on Feb. 11, 1821, indicating his acceptance on condition that as soon as the territorial government was organized he be permitted to resign. For these and other relevant letters, see John S. Bassett (ed.), Correspondence of Andrew Jackson (Washington, 1926–1935, 7 vols.), III, 38–41. Jackson's salary as Governor did not begin until June 1, 1821, the day following the termination of his services as Major General in the Army. The account for his services as Governor from June 1, 1821, to Jan. 1, 1822, in the amount of $2,921.19, is in LC(Jackson Papers, Mil.

S. P., For. Rels., IV, 132–144). A U. S. garrison occupied Fernandina at the northern tip of the island and was kept there throughout the remainder of the Spanish tenure in Fla.(ibid., p. 744; NA, WD, AGO correspondence files).
* Fort Gadsden had been erected on orders of Gen. Jackson by Lt. James Gadsden (for whom see post, p. 41, n.) in 1818 on the east bank of the Apalachicola River in Spanish West Florida. Though other points occupied by American forces during Jackson's campaign against the Indians in that province in 1818, including Pensacola, Barrancas, and St. Marks, were evacuated following the signing of the treaty with Spain, Fort Gadsden remained in U. S. hands (Mark F. Boyd, “Events at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River, 1808–1818,” Fla. Hist. Quar., XVI [Oct. 1937], 55–96; Edgar B. Wesley, Guarding the Frontier; A Study of Frontier Defense from 1815 to 1825 (St. Paul, 1935) pp. 171–173).

* The act approved Mar. 2, 1821 (3 STAT. 615–616), reducing the peace establishment to 6,000 men, resulted in the issuance of a general order on May 17 reorganizing the administration of the Army. Eastern and Western Departments were established divided by a line drawn from the southermost point of East Florida to the northwestern extremity of Lake Superior, all of Ky. and Tenn. being included in the Western Department. Thus Florida was divided between the two departments, East Florida coming under Brig. Gen. Winfield Scott with headquarters at New York, and West Florida under Brig. Gen. Edmund P. Gaines with headquarters at Louisville, Ky. This arrangement endured until 1837. The position of Commanding General of the Army, which was reinstituted at this time after a lapse of 22 years, was filled by Maj. Gen. Jacob Brown, with headquarters at Washington (Raphael P. Thian, Notes on the Military Geography of the United States, 1813–1880 [Washington 1881] pp. 63, 106; Wesley, Guarding the Frontier, pp. 111-113). The act for the reduction of the Army provided for one major general and two brigadier generals. Jacob Brown as the eldest commissioned Major General was to be retained, and the two brigadiers were to be Scott and Gaines. Since Jackson was not to be retained, the President was interested, in order to avoid public criticism of a popular figure by the administration, in persuading him to accept the appointment as Governor of Florida Territory (Memoirs, J. Q. Adams, v, 321–322). An address delivered by Jackson at the close of his military career, May 31, 1821, is in LC (Jackson Papers, Lets. and Orders, Bk. L) and is printed in the Pensacola Floridian, Aug. 18, 1821, Niles' Reg., XXI, 52–53, and Bassett (ed.), op. cit., pp. 62–65. As a further result of the reduction many officers were released who became applicants for civil positions; some of these were subsequently appointed to office in Florida Territory. See, for example, index under Humphreys, Gad, and Smith, Joseph L. On the day that the new organization of the Army came into effect, June 1, 1821, Jackson's career as a Major General terminated. But by virtue of his commission giving him the military authority previously exercised by the Spanish Governor and Captain General of Cuba, and the governors of East and West Florida (ante, p. 18), Jackson continued thereafter and throughout his stay in Florida to issue orders to the officers commanding the U. S. military forces. George M. Brooke, colonel of the companies of the Fourth Infantry which garrisoned Pensacola, communicated with the War Department on the matter. A discussion of the question occurred at a cabinet meeting on Oct. 23, 1821, in which the Secretary of State upheld Jackson's right as Captain General to the military command in Florida. The President, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of War believed that Jackson's command had ceased, but a decision was postponed (Memoirs, J. Q. Adams, v, 366–367). See also post, p. 22.

Thomas Butler, friend of Jackson, Robert Butler had been appointed a captain in the Army in 1812. He saw service in both the War of 1812 and the Seminole campaign of 1818 under Jackson. His military career was terminated by his resignation, Nov. 16, 1821, following his declination of an assignment to the First Infantry in the reduced rank of lieutenant colonel (Butler to the President, Nov. 16, 1821, LC, Monroe Papers, Vol. 31). Even before the acceptance of his resignation, he had hopes for the appointment of surveyor general of Florida (Bassett, ed., Corr.

* A native of Maryland and a lawyer by profession, he was elected to the Senate of that State in the fall of 1814. He had been recommended to the President for a Federal appointment in the preceding year (Kent to the President, July 26, 1813, NA, SD, Applications). Worthington was serving as principal clerk in the office of Joseph Anderson, Comptroller, U. S. Treasury, when that official recommended him to the President, July 23, Nov. 9, 1816, for an appointment as a consul, district judge of Indiana Territory, or the collectorship at New Orleans (loc. cit.). Early in 1817 Worthington was appointed special agent of the State Department to establish and promote commercial relations with Argentina, Chile, and Peru. Following the termination of that agency, he applied to the Secretary of State, June 30, 1819, for another appointment (loc. cit.). Recommendations in his behalf (loc. cit.) are as follows: Sen. Edward Lloyd (Md.) to the President, Apr. 10, 1820; Sen. William Pinkney (Md.) to id., Apr. 5, 1820; Rep. Kent to id., Apr. 4, 1820, enclosing a recommendation, Mar. 22, 1820, signed by the following members of the delegation in Congress from Maryland: Joseph Kent, Stevenson Archer, Thomas Culbreth, Samuel Smith, Thomas Bagby, Peter Little, and Henry R. Warfield. Worthington himself again wrote the Secretary of State, Apr. 16, 1821, soliciting further public service (loc. cit.). He was appointed secretary in East Florida May 18, 1821 (post, p. 44).

* In anticipation of the ratification by Spain of the treaty of Feb. 22, 1819, Eligius Fromentin was instructed by the Secretary of State on May 20, 1819, to proceed to Florida in order to be on hand, in the event ratifications were exchanged, to receive the archives which were to be transferred pursuant to the treaty. For references to correspondence relating to this mission, from which the agent was recalled in Aug. 1819, see David W. Parker, Calendar of Papers in Washington Archives Relating to the Territories of the United States (to 1873) (Washington, 1911), pp. 67–68. Fromentin was a French refugee who had settled in Pennsylvania (he had been a Catholic priest in France but subsequently left the Church), taught school in Maryland, emigrated to Upper Louisiana, practiced law in New Orleans, and served as U. S. Senator from Louisiana, 1813–1819 (Cong. Biog. Direct., 1950 ed., p. 1184; Terr. Papers, Orleans, IX, index). He was commissioned a judge in Florida Territory, May 18, 1821. See post, p. 42, n.

His familiarity with Spanish affairs and language and his knowledge of the law won him service under Jackson as secretary and translator in Florida in 1821. He impressed both Jackson and the citizens of Pensacola with his qualifications for a judicial appointment, and was commissioned judge of West Florida, June 5, 1822 (post, p. 451), and was reappointed Jan. 31, 1823, May 27, 1824, and Jan. 9, 1828, serving until his removal by President Jackson in 1832 (Dict.

Continuing in the army after the War of 1812, he participated in Jackson's campaign against the Seminoles in 1818, assisting in the negotiations for the surrender of Pensacola. After the transfer of Pensacola in 1821, he functioned for several months as Acting Secretary of West Florida. He formed a short-lived law partnership with Henry M. Brackenridge at Pensacola in Sept. 1821, and a similar connection with Richard J. Easter in July 1822 (Pensacola Floridian, Sept. 1, 1821, July 20, 1822). His career in the territory following his resignation from the Army on May 1, 1822, became closely connected with the public affairs of the area and will be found documented in the present work. Sketches of his life are contained in the following articles: Caroline M. Brevard, “Richard Keith Call” (Fla. Hist. Quar, 1 [July, Oct., 1908), 3–12, 8–20); Sidney W. Martin, “Richard Keith Call, Florida Territorial Leader” (ibid., xx1 (Apr. 1943]); Dict. Amer. Biog., III, 422–423, art. by James A. Robertson. His papers are in the libraries of the University of Florida and the University of North Carolina.

"Coppinger replied on June 19, 1821 (No. 13): “If I comprehend Y. E. propositions, they are, that if I do not consent to leave all the Artillery subject to the decision of our governments, Y. E. offers to transport, on your account, the amunitions and stores excepting the articles cannon, bombs, balls and grape shot, which will remain at mine; leaving subject, likewise, the transportation which Y. E. offers, and the rations consumed in the voyage of said ammunitions and stores, to superior determination; and the ammunitions and implements of War that I leave, remain subject to the same determination.” Such an arrangement was agreeable to him. This letter is printed in A. S. P., Misc., II, 881. On June 20 Butler answered with document No. 14 (printed ibid., p. 882), that he meant that Coppinger should leave all the artillery and then listed 27 pieces including mortars and howitzers that were to remain in battery.

* Jackson's activities during the period March–July (inclusive) 1821, relative to the receipt of the Floridas and the actual transfer of sovereignty, are already extensively documented in print. Limitation of space requires the omission of much material, except key documents such as the above, in order to include unpublished selections concerning the organized territory after 1822. The President's message to Congress, Dec. 3, 1821 (Richardson, comp., Messages and Papers, II, 667-678), in addition to embodying pertinent comments concerning the transfer of the Floridas, was accompanied by numerous relevant papers which are reproduced in the following publications: S. Doc. 1, 17 Cong., 1 sess.; H. Doc. 1, 17 Cong., 1 sess.; and A. S. P., For. Rels., IV, 740–808. Relevant documents are likewise found ibid., Misc., II, 896–909.

* A few other letters from Butler to Jackson relative to the E.

S. S. Nonsuch; July 24, Fort Hawkins, re the journey from St. Augustine to Pensacola; Sept. 19, Woodlawn, re the journey to Tennessee. In the same place is a letter from Jackson to Butler (July 27) relative to the dispatch of Gadsden on July 1 with instructions for Butler and a commission for Worthington. Letters from Jackson to Butler, June 2 and June 13, explain the delays connected with taking over Florida (NA, SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, v). A letter from Butler to the Secretary of War (May 29), detailing the reasons for the delay in taking possession of E. Fla., reports negroes fortifying themselves at Tampa Bay, and the uneasiness of the Indians (NA, WD, SW Lets. Recd., B 303); id. to id. (June 7) reports the arrival of the Spanish commissioner (loc. cit., B294). Butler wrote Col. Brooke (Aug. 14) that after settling affairs as Adjutant General of the Southern Division in Tennessee he would be ready to assume command of the Fourth Infantry (NA, WD, AGO Lets. Recd.).

* Referring to the arrest and imprisonment of Callava and to the ensuing misunderstanding between Jackson and Judge Fromentin respecting the sources of judicial authority in W. Fla. Nicholas Maria Vidal, a former Spanish official, died in 1806 seized of property in Louisiana and Florida, and John Innerarity, agent in Pensacola of the firm of John Forbes and Co., of Mobile, was executor of the estate. Vidal's heirs, however, had been unable to obtain action up to 1821 partly because the relevant papers were in the possession of the Spanish administration. Jackson demanded of Callava that he surrender the papers vital to the settlement of the estate, but he refused to relinquish them as he should have done previously in accordance with the terms of the treaty of 1819. He was consequently arrested and imprisoned on orders of Jackson. When Judge Fromentin interfered with a writ of habeas corpus, Jackson lectured him upon proper subordination to a superior. The nub of the controversy was the extent of the judge's authority, whose commission detailed but two duties (ante, p. 42 n.). The dispute caused a stir not only in Pensacola but also in Washington where it was capitalized on by opponents of the administration. A resolution introduced by Rep. Ezekiel Whitman, of Maine, adopted by the House on Jan. 3, 1822, after remarks by various members, requested the Secretary of State to furnish copies of documents relative to the matter, as well as to the delay on the part of the Spanish in delivering the archives (House Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 42–43, 108–109; Annals of Cong., 17 Cong., 1 sess., I, 534, 558–559, 610–619, 620). With his message of Jan. 28, 1822, the President submitted to Congress an extensive collection of documents from the files of the State Dept., published in H. Doc. 42, 17 Cong., 1 sess., and Annals of Cong., 17 Cong., 1 sess., II, 2295– 2569, and subsequently republished in A. S. P., Misc. II, 799–913, and partly republished in A. S. P., For. Rels., IV, 765 et seq. A supplementary group of papers transmitted to Congress by the President on Apr. 18 was published in H. Doc. 113, 17 Cong., 1 sess., and S. Doc. 86, 17 Cong., 1 sess., and later republished in A. S. P., For. Rels., IV, 765 et seq. The most important communications between Jackson and the Secretary of State on this subject appear in Bassett (ed.), Corr. Jackson, III, 112–116, 126-129, 133–139. The foregoing publications include practically all of the documents to be found in the records of the State Department. The only exceptions of any importance are the following: Fromentin to the Secretary of State, Aug. 28, 1821 (NA, SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, VII, printed, Pensacola Floridian, Apr. 6, 1822), and id. to id., Nov. 12, 1821 (NA, loc. cit., IX, 7). A letter from Fromentin to the editors of the Floridian, Nov. 12, 1821, is in Niles’ Reg., XXI, 252-253. Jackson evidently transmitted an almost complete documentation of the episode to the State Department, for only a few other documents of minor value have been found in his papers. A lucid account of the dispute is in John S. Bassett, Life of Andrew Jackson, 1, 301–310. See also James Parton, Life of Andrew Jackson, II, 616 et seq.

The records series cited is composed of transcripts obtained by the department from the collectors of customs after the fire, but it appears to be only a partial collection of the correspondence.
* This was a U. S. naval vessel captained by Lt. Comdr. Lawrence Kearny, who on June 27, 1821, then at Washington, had been instructed by the Secretary of the Navy to receive on board for conveyance to Pensacola William S. Smith and wife and Alexander Scott, Jr. (NA, ND, SN Lets. to Officers Ships of War, Bk. 14). Kearny reported from Pensacola Aug. 24, his arrival there on Aug. 12 and the safe landing of the passengers (NA, ND, SN, Officers Letters, 1823, Bk. 5).
* Alexander Scott, Jr. evidently became at this time the Inspector of Customs at Pensacola, a position which he held until illegally suspended by the Collector on Oct. 29, 1824 (Senate Report 130, 21 Cong, 1 sess.). After Nov. 1, 1822, when his father departed, he also served as Deputy Collector. Years later after the death of Alexander Scott, Jr., his mother, Elizabeth Scott, as his assignee, obtained compensation, amounting to $3,078, for the period of his suspension from Sept. 30, 1824 to July 22, 1827, when the machinery of government finally restored him to the inspectorship (R.

* In a lengthy letter from the President to the Secretary of War, written at his retreat at Oak Hill, Va., Oct. 11, 1821 (NA, WD, SW Lets. Recd., P 84), occurs the following passage: “I return you the papers, relating to the Indians in Florida, . . . . The measure taken in regard to the Indians, was noticed in my letter by the last mail. In the present state of information, we can do nothing more than to add to our stock, by the means already adopted. Capt." Bell with Mr Peniers will doubtless enable us, by what they will acquire, & transmit, to take such steps as may be proper, & to which our present powers are competent, & where they are not, to present such a view before Congress, as it may enable it to supply the deficiency. I am well aware, that every thing that, respecting the Indians, as to title to land, and indeed as to the whites, in that and every other respect, is in the utmost confusion. We must do all that we can to preserve order there till the meeting of Congress, & to enable that body, by communicating to it all the light necessary for the purpose, to secure it afterwards.”

Recd., P 84) are pertinent: “In the affair at Pensacola, I am of opinion, as at present advised, that Mr Fromentin had no right to issue a writ of H. C., he being appointed for the sole purpose of executing the laws, for the collection of the revenue, & suppression of the slave trade, no other ether laws, as is manifest by the act of Congress, being extended to the Floridas, the laws of Spain on the contrary being specially, maintaind, in force there, for the internal gov" for the present. He mistook his power therefore. With respect to the conduct of the governor, in regard to Calava I have no doubt that the latter acted as a scoundrel, & deservd the chastisement he receivd. The disgorgement of the papers, which he had suppressd, proved this. With Spain, there may be some forms to be observ'd, in regard to his arrest, not that I think, he had any diplomatic character or priviledges, but that having been so lately the governor, her pride may be wounded, at a measure toward him, so decisive, however well merited.

Papers, III; NA, GAO, Fifth Auditor's Rept. on Acct. of Andrew Jackson, No. 1162, Aug. 17, 1822).
* Answered post, p. 350. Other letters written by the President relating to affairs in Fla. are printed in Hamilton (ed.), op.cit., pp. 174–176, 197–198, 199–200.

* Other recommendations for appointment as judge are in NA (SD, Applications). Joseph Wilson, of North Carolina, was recommended to the President by Sen. Montfort Stokes of that State, May 6, 1822. Two residents of Indiana, General W. Johnston, the Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives, and William W. Wick, were recommended to the Secretary of State by Gov. William Hendricks, Dec. 17, 1822 and Jan. 6, 1823, respectively.

* The British built a fort at Pensacola during the 1770's which they named Fort George. Following the Spanish conquest of Pensacola in 1781, this fort was repaired and renamed Fort St. Michael (Fred Cubberly, “Fort George (St. Michael), Pensacola,” Fla. Hist. Quar., VI, Apr. 1928, pp. 220–234; Stanley Fays, “British and Spanish Fortifications of Pensacola, 1781–1872,” ibid., xx, Jan. 1942, p. 282). - -

* The discrepancy in this name has appeared frequently in printings of documents from the period. In Spanish Land Grants in Fla., II, 255, 256, and III, 44, the name appears as Milan. A.S.P., Pub. Lands, VI, 545 has Millan but H. Report 83, 17 Cong., 1 sess., gives the name as William.

* Several letters re Indian affairs were written by Capt. Bell, while he was in Washington. With his letter of Jan. 14, 1822, announcing his arrival, he submitted several enclosures illustrating relations between the Indians and the Spanish (NA, WD, SW Lets. Recd., B 262). In a letter of Jan. 22 he submitted information concerning the Indians in Florida and enclosed a list of their settlements (loc. cit., B 263; an extract of the letter and the list are published in H. Doc. 51, 17 Cong., 2 sess.; the list is printed post, p. 463). Bell left Washington early in May for St. Augustine (Bell to the Secretary of War, May 1 and May 20, 1822, NA, loc. cit., B 102, B 385). From the latter place he wrote on May 26, expressing his disappointment at not receiving the appointment as Indian Agent in Florida (loc. cit., B 419). After Pelham was granted a leave of absence, Bell declined to act for him in Indian affairs, having severed all connection therewith (Bell to the Secretary of War, July 16, 1822, loc. cit., B 69). He was instructed by the Secretary on Aug. 20 to turn over money and property of the Indian Department to Gov. DuVal (NA, OIA, SW Lets. Sent, Bk. E).
<pb#349>
* During the remainder of Worthington's tenure in E. Fla., Indian relations were of a rather routine nature. He was visited in April 1822 by Chief Oponey and in the next month by Micanope and the Pond Chief and advised them about their intercourse with the whites who were pressing upon their territory. Relevant letters from Worthington to the Secretary of War are dated as follows: Jan. 22, Mar. 7, Mar. 26, Apr. 6, May 4, May 20, May 22, May 28, and June 24, 1822 (NA, WD, SW Lets. Recd.).

* In his message to the Congress, Dec. 3, 1821 (Richardson, comp., Messages and Papers, II, 672–674), the President reviewed, in some detail, the difficulties encountered in the administration of Florida Territory under the act approved Mar. 3, 1821 (ante, p. 5) during the tenure of Andrew Jackson (see post, p. 661), and recommended early action by the Congress. A bill to that end was introduced in the Senate Feb. 6, 1822, which became law with the President's approval Mar. 30, 1822. The legislative history of this action is found in Senate Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 115, 122, 146, 155, 164, 166, 176,229; House Journal, 17 Cong, 1 sess., pp. 328,333, 340,395–396, 404, 407,410, 420; Annals of Cong., 17 Cong, 1 sess., cols. 182, 194,225–226,238,277–278,279,344, 803, 1238, 1244, 1268, 1374-1377, 1379. The original Senate bill (printed) is in NA (HF, 17 Cong.). No other items have survived.

* Within the text of this law are embodied the chief principles of territorial (colonial) government as originally laid down in the Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787, and its essential amendments, of Aug. 7, 1789, and May 8, 1792 (Terr. Papers, N.W., II, 39–50,203–204,395–396). There were of course additions and subtractions from that early pattern as well as modifying and clarifying passages not only in the text of the above instrument but also in the several basic laws for the governments of the Southwest, Mississippi, Indiana, Orleans, Michigan, Louisiana-Missouri, Illinois, Alabama, and Arkansas territories, all of which preceded the establishment of Florida Territory. Cf. texts of acts, in sequence, printed ibid., III, 86–88, IV, 18–19, V, 18–22, IX, 202–213,405–407, x, 5–7, XIII, 92–95, XIV, 552–559, XVI, 6–8, XVIII, 53–57, and XIX, 44–50. Specifically, the passages in sections two, three, and four above are found in each of the laws cited; they stem directly from the Northwest Ordinance and its amending acts. The fact of the omission of a direct mention of the original Ordinance therefore has no significance, although it is specifically cited in the laws establishing the Southwest, Mississippi, Indiana, Orleans, Michigan, and Illinois territories, and, on the other hand, reference to the Ordinance is omitted in the acts creating the Louisiana-Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas territories. See expository article by Clarence E. Carter, “Apprenticeship for Statehood” (Dept. of State Bulletin, XII (June 17, 1945], 1109–1114); and id., “Colonialism in Continental United States” (South Atlantic Quarterly, XLVII [January, 1948], 17–28). For a new, scholarly treatment of the Northwest Ordinance, with special reference to its origin, imperfections and influence in the structure of succeeding territories, see Francis S. Philbrick (ed.), LAWS ILL. TERR. (IHC, XXV, Springfield, 1950), Introduction.
* This was the fourth territory out of the eleven thus far established in which limited tenure was applied, the others having been Orleans, Missouri, and Arkansas. See post, p. 469.
* From the beginning of territorial history the power of the Governor to grant pardons had been viewed as implied, and had been executed on occasion (Philbrick, op. cit., p. cccclxiv). The first direct grant of the power of pardon is found in an act approved Mar. 26, 1804 (Terr. Papers, Orleans, IX, 204, 210), which established Orleans Territory and the District of Louisiana. The authority in question was again conferred upon the Governor in an act approved June 4, 1812 (ibid., La.-Mo., XIV, 553), establishing Missouri Territory.
* Notably missing is the power of veto, a situation remedied in the amendatory act approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 751, sec. 6).
<pb#411>
* The Executive Register for the Territory of Florida for the period covered by this volume, such as that published in Terr. Papers (Ill.), XVII, pp. 617-672, has not been found in the records of the Department of State in the National Archives, nor is the original in the custody of the Secretary of State of the State of Florida. The records of the executive department of the Territory of Florida have been imperfectly preserved. For information concerning them, see David Y. Thomas, “Report on the Public Archives of Florida,” Amer. Hist. Assoc. Ann. Rept., 1906, II, 149–158; U. S. Library of Congress, Photoduplication Service, A Guide to the Microfilm Collection of Early State Records, collected and compiled under the direction of William S. Jenkins, edited by Lillian A. Hamrick (Washington, 1950); and for certain records in the custody of the Florida Historical Society, see Historical Records Survey, Florida, Guide to Depositories of Manuscript Collections in the United States: Florida (Jacksonville, 1940), p. 7.
* See sec. 4 of act approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 750-754), which prohibits the Governor from leaving the territory without the permission of the President. This restriction was removed by sec. 6 of act approved May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 47).
* This is the second occasion in which the normal arrangement, stemming from the Ordinance of 1787, empowering the Governor and Judges to pass or adopt laws for the territory during the first stage of government has been changed to exclude the Judges from legislative duties and to substitute a Legislative Council. The above section is predicated on a similar provision in the act approved Mar. 26, 1804, establishing the Territory of Orleans (Terr. Papers, Orleans, IX, 204).
* The process of legislation by the Governor and Council is further amplified in an act approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 751–752); see sec. 6, p. 751. This section was repealed by an act approved May 15, 1826 (4 STAT. 164–167).
<pb#412>
* In an act approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 751–752), amending the above law, the following provision was added at this point of the text: “nine of whom shall constitute a quorum to do business.” The amending act also contains the following language at this point: “or from among the inhabitants of the territory, resident there at the cession; but no person shall be eligible as a member of the said legislative council, who shall not have resided in the said territory at least six months previous to his appointment.” Another amending act, approved May 15, 1826 (4 STAT. 164–167), provided for the popular election of the thirteen members of the Council.
* In the amending act of 1823 "St. Augustine, or at such other place or places, as the governor and council may, from time to time, direct” was here substituted.

* Subsequent legislation modifying the sections of this act relating to the superior courts include the acts approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 752), May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 45–47), May 15, 1826 (4 STAT. 164–165), and Mar. 3, 1827 (4 STAT. 241). The act of May 26, 1824, established a court of appeals, concerning which there was a further act approved July 14, 1832 (4 STAT. 600–601). For an analysis of the acts of Congress and the acts of the Legislative Council relative to the courts in the territory, see Charles D. Farris, “Courts of Territorial Florida” (Fla. Hist. Quar., XIX [Apr. 1941]) 346–367. In Amer. Ins. Co. v. Canter (1 Peters 511) Justice Marshall held that the Florida territorial courts, the judges of which were limited to four years, were not constitutional courts; they were purely legislative in character and their jurisdiction was not, therefore, a part of the judicial power of the United States as defined by the Constitution. The limited tenure principle, as defined in the above text (also found in the organic acts establishing Orleans, Missouri, and Arkansas territories) appears to have been one of Marshall's principal arguments in support of his opinion that territorial courts could not function as courts of the United States. In all the other territories established anterior to 1828, with the exceptions mentioned, the judges' tenure was during good behavior. It is important to note that the opinion in question was basic for the remainder of the territories established by the United States. For a full discussion, see William B. Hamilton, Anglo-American Law: Thomas Rodney and his Territorial Cases (Duke Univ. Press, Durham, 1953), pp. 91-124.
* This is the second instance in which, in Federal territorial legislation, the U. S. District Court of Kentucky is cited as defining the Federal jurisdiction of the territorial Supreme Court; the first having been in the act approved Mar. 26, 1804, establishing the Territory of Orleans (Terr. Papers, Orleans, Ix, 208). A

*The bill as passed by the Senate provided for an annual salary of $3000 (Annals, 17 Cong., 1 sess., col. 226); an attempt had been made to fix the salary of the Governor at $5000, which had been accorded to the Governor of Louisiana Territory (Terr. Papers, Orleans, IX, 206), as well as to Governor Jackson during the transition government of Florida Territory. The bill as finally passed, however, contained the above figure. Presumably the House amended the bill to that effect, but no proof is found in either the House Journal or in the Annals as to the nature of the amendments attached to the bill by the lower House. There are no manuscripts or printed records relating to the matter in the legislative records found in the National Archives.
* A stipend of $1000 was first proposed in the Senate; the above salary was then adopted (Annals, op. cit.).
* Extensive discussion arose concerning the Judges’ salaries, which turned on such items as the cost of living, duties, abilities and learning required, and a comparison of stipands allowed Judges in other territories. . A salary of $2000 was at first proposed and defeated; a motion for a salary of $1800 was also lost. Agreement was then reached on the above named salary (ibid.).
* Listing of acts of Congress as applicable to the new territory was, up to this time, almost exceptional; the only other instance of embodying such a list in the fundamental law of a territory was that enacted for the establishment of Orleans Territory, approved Mar. 26, 1804 (Terr. Papers, Orleans, IX, 206-207).

* In the House a motion was made by Rep.

But Rep. Rhea, of Tennessee, successfully argued against the motion, declaring that new citizens of alien extraction would not understand such compact language, which did not specifically emphasize the American principles of constitutional liberty (Annals, 17 Cong., 1 sess., cols. 1374–1377).

In the first instance Walton was nominated Secretary of “the Floridas,” an error for “Florida Territory.” He accepted the appointment on June 16, 1822 (post, p. 456). His first salary payment as Secretary of Florida Territory was in the sum of $701.66, covering the quarter June 20–Dec. 31, 1822 (NA, GAO, Fifth Auditor's Rept. No. 2, p. 450).

* Nominated Apr. 15, 1822, renominated Apr. 17, and confirmed Apr. 25 (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 293, 295, 297). The commission was transmitted May 23, 1822 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., XIX). A recommendation to the Secretary of State, Feb. 6, 1822, on Hamilton's behalf, was signed by numerous members of the delegation in Congress from New York (NA, SD, Applications). 42 A number of applications and recommendations for this post are also found loc. cit.: Greenbury Gaither, of Nelson County, Ky., was recommended by W. G. D. Worthington, Dec. 4, 1821; James McKibbin, of S. C., was recommended to the President by members of the delegation in Congress from that State, Dec. 24, 1821; George Murray, prosecuting attorney of St. Johns County, Fla. Terr., was recommended by Reps. Edward B. Jackson and Jared Williams (Va.), and by Sen. David Holmes (Miss.), Dec. 20, 1821; J. A. Cuthbert, of Milledgeville, Ga., wrote to the President, Dec. 11, 1821, soliciting the appointment for Alexander Rembert, of Eatonton, Ga. Another resident of Georgia, William F. Steele, was the subject of the following recommendations: Rep. Robert R. Reid to the Secretary of State, Dec. 17, 1821, Sen. Mahlon Dickerson (N.J.) to id., Dec. 20, 1821, Rep. George McDuffie (S. C.) to id., Jan. 17, 1822, enclosing a letter from J. Camak, of Milledgeville, Ga., Dec. 24, 1821. James Webb, of Ga., B. Elmore, of S. C., and John H. Chaplin, of Pensacola, Fla., were also candidates.
* On the same date and in the same form a commission as United States attorney for W. Fla. was signed for Tipton B. Harrison, of Lynchburg, Va. The commission was transmitted to Harrison on May 22 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., XIX), and acknowledged by him July 28 (NA, SD, Misc. Lets.). Several recommendations on Harrison's behalf are found in NA (SD, Applications), principally from members of the Virginia delegation in Congress. Richard K. Call, of Tenn., aid to Jackson, and Joseph M. White, of Ky, were also active candidates, each with Congressional support. Supporting letters are found under the names of the applicants.

* Joseph Lee Smith abandoned a law practice in Connecticut in 1812 to become an infantry officer in the U. S. Army. He remained in the service after the War of 1812, becoming a colonel in 1818. But on the reduction of the Army in 1821 he was discharged, and to support a numerous family sought public employment. See Sen. Lanman, of Conn., to the President containing a general recommendation, and Thomas Y. Tone, of Brownsville, Conn., to id., Feb. 12, 1822, recommending Smith for appointment as Governor of Florida Territory (NA, SD, Applications), and Heitman, op. cit., p. 901. He was the father of Edmund Kirby Smith, Confederate General, whose boyhood was passed in St. Augustine.
* Nominated Apr. 15, 1822, renominated Apr. 17, and confirmed Apr. 30, 1822 (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 293, 295, 300). An identical commission of same date was issued to John Branch, of N. C., who declined the office. In this connection the Secretary of State inserted the following comment in his diary: “The President showed me a letter from Mr. Macon, the North Carolina Senator, to him, requesting him to withdraw the nomination of his friend, the late Governor, John Branch, to the appointment of Judge in Florida, which he was sure he will not accept, and regretting that he had recommended him for the nomination as Governor, which, he says, he should not have done but that he thought it was the President's own desire. Macon . . . takes it in high dudgeon that his friend Branch was not nominated as Governor. The President also read to me the draft of his answer declining to revoke the nomination, and assigning his reasons for nominating Mr. Duval, which were very sufficient” (Memoirs J. Q. Adams, V, 491). It appears that there was a general objection to Branch on the part of the North Carolina delegation to his appointment as Judge on the ground that he had never practiced law. But Adams believed that they were merely revealing their resentment that Branch had not been appointed Governor (ibid., p. 494).

* The persons listed in this commission were nominated to the Senate Apr. 28, 1822 (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 298). Sen. William Smith, chairman of the Committee on Judiciary, wrote to the Secretary of State, Apr. 30, 1822 enquiring, whether the message should not state the persons to be residents of the Territory in accordance with the law (sec. 5 of the act of Mar. 30, 1822, ante, p. 391) and suggesting presentation of the question to the President (ante, p. 417). A message of the President of May 4 withdrew the nominations of Apr. 28 and nominated the same persons with the statement that most of them were citizens of the Territory and the others were moving there with the intention of being present by the time the Council met (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 303). Confirmation of the nominations occurred on May 4 (ibid.). A copy of the commission was sent on May 14 to Edmund Law at St. Augustine (NA, SD, Dom. Lets. XIX) with the request that he inform the other members of the council living in E. Fla. and stating that the original commission had been sent to Gov. DuVal at Pensacola.

Greenberry Gaither and George Murray were appointed on June 5, 1822, to replace them (NA, SD, Temp. Comms., Pres.), and their commissions were sent to Gov. DuVal on June 12 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., XIX). See post, pp. 448, 449, 489.
* In NA(SD, Applications) are recommendations for appointments to the Legislative Council in addition to those recommended by DuVal on Apr. 16 (ante p. 406). Thomas I. Wyche, a member of the city council of Pensacola, was recommended to the Secretary of State by William Barnette, of the “Oaks” near Pensacola, Mar. 1, 1822, and by Rep. Mark Alexander (Va.) to the President, Mar. 30. Rep. James Blair (S.C.) presented to the President, Apr. 22, 1822, an extract of a letter from John Geddes, former governor of South Carolina, recommending John B. Strong, a lawyer of E. Fla., who had formerly practiced law in New York. William Reynolds, of St. Augustine, Fla., formerly of Lancaster County, Pa., was recommended to the President by Rep. James Buchanan (Pa.), ante, p. 415. Act. Gov. Worthington wrote to the Secretary of State, Mar. 26, 1822, recommending the following persons: Francis Fatio, Farquhar Bethune, Thomas H. Penn, James G. Forbes, George Murray, Benjamin Chaires, George Kingsley, James Darley, G. W. Perpall, Martin Hernandez, and Bartholme Castro, as qualified nominees from whom a selection could be made (NA, SD, Misc.

* This measure originated in the Senate. On Dec. 31, 1821, a motion was introduced to instruct the Committee on Public Lands to consider the propriety of reporting a bill for the adjustment of land claims in East and West Florida, which was agreed to on Jan. 2, 1822. A bill to that end was introduced on Mar. 1 which passed through the usual readings, was discussed in Committee of the Whole for several days and several times amended, and finally passed by that body on Apr. 17, 1822, and sent to the House for the latter's concurrence. The House passed the bill, with the addition of amendments, and returned it to its place of origin on May 7. The Senate concurred in the House amendments on May 8, and the measure was approved by the President on the same date (Senate Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 47,49, 160, 163, 249, 254, 264, 266, 277, 281, 374, 375, 379; House Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 469, 470, 494, 595). A similar bill had been introduced in the House on Mar. 18, but no action was taken thereon beyond the second reading and committment (ibid., p. 362). No debate was reported in Annals of Congress. The title in the original bill read: “An Act for ascertaining claims and titles to land within the territories of East and West Florida.” It was amended in the House on third reading (endorsement on one of the two printed bills). There are present four different versions of the original bill (S. 62) in NA (SF 17 Cong., 1 sess.): the original hand-written draft by Sen. John H. Eaton, which was introduced on Mar. 1, two printed copies under the same date containing numerous emendations, and the engrossed Senate copy as passed by that body and transmitted to the House of Representatives for concurrence. This fourth version enables us to identify the origin of the various amendments mentioned above. Brackets in the above text are editorial.

* Legally speaking, the history of the Territory of Florida, already established on paper (ante, p. 389), began on the date of the receipt of Walton's commission. The appointed Governor (DuVal) not having arrived, Walton, now clothed with his commission as Secretary, became ipso facto the Acting Governor of the territory, and no longer that of the province of W. Fla... This was a principle embodied in the original Ordinance of 1787 that in the absence of the Governor, the

* - GEO. WALTON THE HON” J. Q. ADAMS Secretary of State. Washington. [Endorsed] Walton George Pensacola, 16th June 1822 Recd 11th July. His salary and compensation. Secretary should perform the Governor's functions. Walton was evidently unaware, also, of situations in other territories which paralleled his own in which the Secretary actually administered the territory until the arrival of the Governor. See, for example, Terr. Papers (Ill.), XVI, 29 et seq. and ibid. (Ark.), XIX, 85 et seq. In each instance the Governor was late in arriving and the Secretary, duly commissioned, was on the ground and commenced the administration of the territorial government. Walton's position is understandable, however, in view of the expectation of the early arrival of Governor DuVal, which in fact occurred five days later (post, p.470, n.). It must also be noted that Walton was paid as Secretary and Acting Governor of W. Fla. for the period May 18, 1821—June 20, 1822, in the sum of $1639.72 in addition to other items than salary (NA, GAO, Fifth Auditor's Rept. No. 2, p. 323, certified Dec. 31, 1822). See, however, Walton's certificate, dated Feb. 4, 1822, that he assumed office as Secretary of West Florida on Aug. 10, 1821, relieving Capt. Call on that date (NA, GAO, Misc. Treas. Accts., No. 1130 [1822]).

* Several other recommendations for the appointment as Governor are on file in NA (SD, Applications). A number were in support of William King, lately a Colonel in the U. S. Army, who had served as civil and military governor at Pensacola following Jackson’s conquest of that place in 1818. Recommendations in King's favor include the following: William Crawford of St. Stephens, Ala., to the Sec. of State, Oct. 27, 1821; two petitions, one signed by American inhabitants of W. Fla. and the other by Spanish inhabitants, forwarded by Jackson to the President, Nov. 30, 1821; an undated recommendation signed by Col. Duncan L. Clinch, Maj. James E. Dinkins, and other officers of the fourth infantry, and Surgeon Moses H. Elliott. Former Rep. Francis Preston (Va.) recommended his brother, James P. Preston, late governor of Va., to the President, Dec. 19, 1821, and Rep. Robert Wright (Md.) wrote favoring the same person, Mar. 26, 1822. Jacob Brown, Commanding General of the U. S. Army, and Sen. James Lanman (Conn.) recommended Joseph L. Smith, of Conn., late colonel in the U. S. Army, Feb. 12 and Mar. 29, 1822, respectively. The attention of the Sec. of State was called by Sen. Nathaniel Macon (N. C.) to the recommendation of the previous session in support of John Branch, late governor of N. C., Feb. 21, 1822. Concerning Branch, see also Memoirs of J. Q. Adams, V, 491,494 (Apr. 16 and Apr. 19, 1822). James Strong, a former Representative in Congress from N.Y., applied in person to the Sec. of State (ibid., pp. 455,456- 457, Dec. 18 and Dec. 21, 1821). a DuVal arrived in Pensacola and assumed his duties as Governor on June 20, 1822 (post, p. 475). 469

* Section 14 of the act approved Mar. 30, 1822 (ante, p. 389), organizing the government of the Territory of Florida, provided for the election of one Delegate to Congress. According to an act of the Legislative Council of Aug. 12, 1822 (Fla. Acts, 1822, pp. 9-12), all free, white, male inhabitants of the Territory over 21 years of age who were in Florida at the time of the cession or who resided there at the time of the passage of the act were to vote on the last Monday of September. Joseph Marion (José Mariano) Hernandez was elected and upon taking the oath administered by the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Jan. 3, 1823, he took his seat (House Journal, 17 Cong., 2 sess., p. 95). As in the case of Delegates from other territories, in accordance with the provision of the Ordinance of 1787, the Delegate had the right of debating but not of voting. He presented the needs of the territory not only to the Congress but also to the President and the heads of the executive departments. Born in St. Augustine in 1792, Hernandez had been a public figure during the Spanish regime and upon the transfer of the country had become a citizen of the United States. He owned a plantation 20 miles south of St. Augustine. He served as delegate only until Mar. 3, 1823, but he subsequently held a number of positions of importance in the Territory. The territorial act of Mar. 30, 1822, in allowing the time and place of voting for the delegate and the qualifications of the voters to be established by the Governor and the Legislative Council (sec. 12), extended a greater measure of local autonomy than had hitherto been granted to territories.

** An act organizing the militia of the territory was passed by the Legislative Council on Sept. 13, 1822.

The nominations of Call and Hernandez were submitted to the Senate by the President on Jan. 15, 1823 and were confirmed on Feb. 17 (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 324, 333).

" In accordance with the organic act of Mar. 30, 1822 (ante, p. 389), the acts of the Legislative Council were regularly printed in pamphlet form throughout the territorial period. For checklist, see Theodore L. Cole (comp.), “Bibliography of the Statute Law of the Southern States, Florida,” Southern Hist. Assn. Pubs., I (July 1897), pp. 213–214; see also U. S. Library of Congress, Guide to the Microfilm Collection of Early State Records, “Session Laws,” p. 51. In 1838 the Legislative Council authorized a collection of the laws, which was prepared by John P. Duval and published under the title Compilation of the Public Acts of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, Passed Prior to 1840 (Tallahassee, 1839). The original enrolled acts are in the custody of the Fla. Secretary of State. By law the Governor was required to send copies of the acts to the President for the approval of Congress (ante, p. 391), but nothing like a complete file can now be found in the National Archives. A complete set of the printed statutes for the territorial period is in the Laws section of the Library of Congress.

* This letter was laid before the House of Representatives by the Speaker on Jan. 15, 1823 (House Journal, 17 Cong., 2 sess., p. 132), and on the same date Del. Hernandez, of Florida Territory, introduced a resolution to instruct the Committee on Public Lands to inquire into the expediency of amending the act for ascertaining claims and titles to lands in the territory, approved May 8, 1822 (3 STAT. 709–718). The end result was the passage of an act approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 754–756), designed to remedy the defects in the former act. Among the various new provisions was one setting up a second board of commissioners to be located in E. Fla., the existing board now being allocated solely to W. Fla. Two land offices were authorized to be located in E. and W. Fla., respectively. These land offices were to be implemented by the President as soon as land claims had been determined (the commissioners having sole power to assess the validity of claims under 3,500 acres). The appointment of registers and receivers for the land offices, and the appointment of a surveyor of public lands, likewise authorized by the new law, must therefore await the time when claims had been either validated or rejected. This meant an indefinite postponement of the sale of public lands. See post, p. 563.

* A number of applicants for this appointment had come forth in the preceding year. Daniel Duval, of Mobile, Ala., had been recommended to the Secretary of State by Harry Toulmin, May 22, 1822. Thomas Brownejohn, a resident of Pensacola was recommended to the Secretary of War, July 23, by William Barnett of that place. Joseph Shomo, a late captain of the Fourth U. S. Infantry, then at Pensacola, applied to the President, July 28, and was supported by a recommendation signed by T. B. Harrison, J. C. Bronaugh, Samuel R. Overton, Edmund Law, George Murray, D. L. Clinch, and C. Nichols [Cary Nicholas?], July 28. William Davison, the sheriff at Pensacola, was recommended to the President by Joseph M. White and Joseph E. Caro, also of Pensacola, Oct. 28. On behalf of Davison came another recommendation from the same place, Nov. 20, signed by John R. Fenwick, N. Shackelford, Joseph Noriega, Joseph E. Caro, and Joseph M. White. Davison on Nov. 29 solicited the aid of Andrew Jackson, who on Dec. 30 wrote to the President. All of the recommendations mentioned are found in NA (SD, Applications).
* An earlier appointee to this position never undertook the duties of the office. A commission as marshal of W. Fla., dated May 7, 1822 (NA, SD, Misc. Perm. Comms.), for Benjamin Robertson was sent to Judge Brackenridge on June 11 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., XIX). After receiving a letter from Brackenridge, Aug. 4, 1822 (ante, p. 505), which reported the failure of Robertson to arrive at Pensacola the Sec. of State wrote to the latter at Fayetteville, N. C., Aug. 30, expressing the wish of the President that he lose no time in going to his post, if he wished to hold the commission (ibid.). A letter of Sept. 7, 1822, signed “Benjamin Robinson” (not Robertson), stated that he had become sick in July when about to travel to Fla. and would not recover for several weeks, and therefore resigned the commission (NA, SD, Misc. Lets.). From this last letter it is evident that the commission had been issued in the wrong name. The mistake seems to have originated in a letter of recommendation, May 3, 1822, from Montfort Stokes and William R. King to the President (NA, SD, Applications).

* The background of this act is found in the difficulties encountered by the Land Commissioners appointed pursuant to the act approved May 8, 1822 (ante, p. 424). The Commissioners commenced their examination of land titles at Pensacola, W. Fla., and when the work was completed they were to transfer their activities to St. Augustine, in E. Fla. On Oct. 21, 1822, the two active members of the Board recommended to the Secretary of State a measure to extend the time prescribed by law for finishing the business in E. Fla. (ante, p. 552), which had been delayed by lack of official papers and by the prevalence of yellow fever. This letter was laid before the House of Representatives by the Speaker, Jan. 15, 1823 (House Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., p. 132). In a memorial to Congress from E. Fla., Nov. 29, 1822 (ante, p. 570), complaint was made on the delay in the adjustment of land claims in that area. On Dec. 30, 1822, the President was requested by the House of Representatives to submit such information as was in the possession of the executive departments respecting the proceedings of the board in fulfilling its duties in Florida Territory (House Journal, op. cit., p. 84). The President transmitted to the House on Feb. 19, 1823, a report of the Secretary of State (NA, SD, Repts., Bk. 4) to the effect that Commissioners Ware and Overton had attended to the discharge of their duties, and that Preston, the third Commissioner, had never reached Florida. On Jan. 17, 1823, the Senate Committee on Public Lands reported a bill to amend the act of May 8, 1822, and on Feb. 10, the House Committee on Public Lands introduced a like measure (Senate Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., p. 91; House Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., p. 211). The bills thus introduced were amended several times. As first proposed, no provision was made for the survey and sale of public lands, but was added as an amendment. The further legislative history of the act may be followed in Senate Journal, op. cit., pp. 94, 104, 153, 158, 161, 169, 184, 213, 214, 221, 244, 247, 250; House Journal, op. cit., pp. 240, 275, 276, 304, 308; Annals, 17th Cong., 2 sess., cols. 151, 235, 244, 252,258, 269,292, 299, 322, 481, 1065, 1090, 1091, 1124, 1142, 1170, 1171.

Fatio, and Edmund Law. Alexander Hamilton also wrote to the President on Hanham's behalf, Apr. 5, 1822, as did two groups of citizens of E. Fla. in undated letters. Hanham himself wrote the Sec. of State on Sept. 28, 1822, enclosing letters from John Swartwout and Daniel D, Tompkins, of New York, testifying to his meritorious army service, and on Feb. 3, 1823, Judge Smith recommended him to the President.

* Charles Blacker Vignoles, was a young Englishman, formerly in the British Army, who arrived in Charleston, S. C., in the fall of 1817 and became engaged in surveying and mapping for the state of South Carolina. He removed in the summer of 1821 to St. Augustine, Fla., where he was named surveyor and civil engineer of the town. He opened a surveying and land office and advertised for surveying work (St. Augustine, Fla. Gazette, Sept. 8, 1821). There was little work in that line, however, so he set out travelling about the territory with the idea of preparing a book and maps. He submitted to Capt. John R. Bell, on Dec. 17, 1821, a “Report to accompany the Map of part of East Florida,” which is in NA(GLO, Bd. Land Commrs., E. Fla. Reports). In the same place is a “Description of northern part of Florida by Charles Vignoles” dated Jan. 28, 1822. Copies of these reports are in NA (WD, CE, Bulky File No. 40). Capt. Bell's letter of Dec. 19, 1821, acknowledging the first report and map, is printed in Olinthus J. Vignoles, Life of Charles Blacker Vignoles (London, 1889), p. 87. For services in the Indian Department under Captain Bell, Vignoles seems to have been paid subsequently by the United States Government (Secretary of War to Vignoles, Apr. 25, 1823, NA, OIA, SW, Lets. Sent, Bk. E). Towards the end of the summer of 1822, Vignoles arrived in New York. In that place was published in 1823 his Observations Upon the Floridas (N. Y., E. Bliss & E. White), and in the same year his map of Fla. was published by H. S. Tanner of Philadelphia. A manuscript map by Vignoles, in NA (WD, CR, CE, TB), dated 1822, bears the title “Saint John's River from the Bar to the Cowford Drawn from an old British Survey by Charles Vignoles, Surveyor & Civil Engineer Saint Augustine, 1822d.”

In NA (SD, Applications) are recommendations for this position. Gov. DuVal on May 13, 1823, and James Gadsden on May 29 recommended Murray to the Secretary of State. Judge Smith on May 6 recommended Belton A. Copp, a practicing attorney in the Territory, to the President. The position was also solicited by Isaac N. Cox, of Philadelphia, in a letter of Apr. 25 to the Secretary of State.

A resolution of the House of Representatives directing an enquiry into this subject had been referred to the Committee on Commerce on Dec. 18, 1823 (ibid., p. 73). For the passage of a bill, which was reported on Mar. 25, 1824, and noted as approved by the President on May 26, see House Journal, 18 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 337, 573, 576, 587, 596, 598, 602; Senate Journal, 18 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 471, 475, 488, 493, 494, 496. Actually, however, this particular bill, which had been submitted with many others for the approval of the President at the close of the session, was inadvertently not signed by him, and he so informed the House on Feb. 26, 1825 (House Journal, 18 Cong., 2 sess., p. 276). The bill finally became law on Mar. 3, 1825 (4 STAT. 132-133). This act required property taken from vessels wrecked on the coast of Florida to be carried into a port of entry of the United States and made subject to seizure vessels carrying such property to foreign ports or places. A memorial on the subject of wrecking addressed to the President by the Legislative Council in 1823 is printed in Fla., Acts, 1823, pp. 145–147.

Fla., who were to meet at Fort St. Marks on Oct. 1, 1823, to explore the country between the Ockolockony River on the west and the Suwannee River on the east and the northern boundary of the territory and the Gulf of Mexico for the purpose of selecting a site for the seat of government of the Territory. On motion of Del. Call, the U. S. House of Representatives adopted a resolution on Dec. 9, 1823, instructing the Committee on Public Lands to inquire into the expediency of granting to the Territory of Florida 1280 acres of land at the site selected for the capital. The committee reported a bill on Jan. 20, 1824, and on May 24 a law was approved; it provided for a grant of a quarter section of land at the site for the capital and authorized its sale by the Governor and Legislative Council for the purpose of raising funds for the construction of public buildings. Three adjoining sections of land were reserved from sale (House Journal, 18 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 40, 163, 516, 530, 542, 568, 570, 571, 574; 4 STAT., 30–31). See post, p. 855, n. See also Terr.

* Presented to the House by Rep. Thomas P. Moore, this petition was referred on Apr. 5, 1824, to a select committee from which Moore reported a bill on May 4 (House Journal, 18 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 359, 486). In the following session Moore, on Jan. 19, 1825, made another report with a bill, which did not pass (ibid., 18 Cong., 2 sess., p. 146). Another memorial of Feb. 2, 1826 (printed in H. Doc. 100, 19 Cong., 1 sess.) was referred on Feb. 20 to the Committee of the Whole House along with the above petition which had once again been referred to a select committee on Dec. 12, 1825. A favorable report of Dec. 22 (House Report, No. 17, 19 Cong., 1 sess.) resulted in the act approved Apr. 5, 1826 (House Journal, 19 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 37, 84, 272,329, 331, 389, 392, 412, 416, 427; 6 STAT. 339). This act provided for a grant of one township of land, excluding sec. 16, to be located under direction of the Secretary of the Treasury in one of the territories on lands freed from Indian title. A subsequent act of Jan. 29, 1827 (4 STAT. 202) empowered the asylum to relocate the part of the township lost to preemptors on other unappropriated and unreserved lands. The measures taken by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of the GLO, and the agents of the asylum (Samuel K. Nelson, David Thomas, and Richard C. Allen) to locate the grant in Florida Territory are documented in S. Doc. 208, 20 Cong., 1 sess., from material in NA (HR, Orig. Reports, Treas.
