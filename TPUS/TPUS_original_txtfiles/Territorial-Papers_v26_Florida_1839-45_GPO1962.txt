COMMISSION OF ROBERT R. REID AS GOVERNOR
[NA: SD, Temp. Comms., Pres.]
[December 2, 1839]
M. V. BUREN, President of the U. States of America.
To all who shall see these presents, greeting:
Know Ye, that reposing special trust and Confidence in the integrity
and Ability of ROB" R. REID, I do appoint him Governor, in and for
the Territory of Florida,” and do authorize and empower Him to exe-
cute & fulfil the duties of that Office according to Law, and to Have &
to Hold the said Office, with all the powers, privileges and emolu-
ments thereunto of right appertaining unto Him the said ROBERT R.
REID, during the pleasure of the President of the U. States, for the
time being, and until the end of the next Session of the Senate of
the U. States, & no longer.”

[NA:ND, SN Lets. to Officers Ships of War, Bk. 28]
NAVY DEPARTMENT Dec 2nd 1839
SIR. When the U. S. Schooner Flirt is in all respects ready for sea
you will proceed with every possible dispatch to such a point of the
coast of Florida as from your knowledge and experience in that
quarter you shall deem most proper for the commencement of the
Operations with which you are charged.
The nature of these, you will have been made fully acquainted
with through former instructions from the War Depart" while acting
1 Reid had served as Judge of the Eastern District from 1832; see ante, XXIV,
705. See his acceptance, post, p. 10.
* A recess appointment.
*A permanent Commission was made out on the 13th of Dec 1839. [Marginal
note on the MS.] See post, p. 8.

under its orders.—In addition to these your attention will be
directed, so far as may be compatible with the protection you are to
afford at all times to shipwrecked Wessels and Marines to giving
every possible annoyance to the Hostile “Indians” and cooperating
with the military officers, whenever properly called on for that
purpose.
You will also keep a watchful eye upon the Spanish fishermen from
the Island of Cuba, who are allowed under certain conditions specified
in the treaty between the United States and Spain, to fish on the
Coast of Florida, and who it is believed supply the hostile Indians
with ammunition, on sufficient proof of the fact, you will order
them from the Coast
It has occurred to the Department, that your suggestion as to the
practicability of penetrating the everglades and capturing the Indian
Women and Children undoubtedly concealed there, is practicable, if
proper means, are perfectly applied.—You will therefore furnish
yourself with a sufficient number of large flat bottomed boats to
carry all the men, that can at any time be spared from the Wessels
under your Command, and in addition to these procure a like suffi-
ciency of long plantation Canoes, as it is believed they are called.—
Thus with your barges you may approach as near as possible to the
point of operation with the flatbottomed boats proceed as far as the
depth of water will permit, and with the light swift Canoes
penetrate whenever there is Water. By these means, the Department
cannot but hope you will be able to penetrate the Everglades further
than has yet been done by white men, Surprise and capture the Indian
Women and Children, and thus end a War which has cost so many
millions
In addition to these boats, you are authorized, if opportunity
offers to procure a couple or more of Spanish blood hounds, not to
hunt down and destroy the Indians, but to be employed in scouring
the banks of the Streams or inlets, into which you may penetrate in
order to guard against ambuscades. the most extreme caution is
required in the Enterprise to which your attention has been directed,
and the Department cannot but consider an officer who exposes
himself to the possibility of surprise, as chargeable with the grossest
negligence, and responsible for all the consequences.
When not engaged in any undertaking requiring the co-operation
of all the Wessels, it is desirable, that they should be employed sep-
arately, at such points as you may deem most proper, and which
circumstances may seem most to require. You will be careful to
preserve the strictest discipline, and to enjoin on all young officers
to be careful to conduct themselves in their intercourse with the
Inhabitants of Florida in such a manner as to acquire and preserve

their respect and confidence—The Service in which they are engaged
is one of dangers and exposure, which it is hoped will finally result
to their honor and the benefit of the Country.
The Department requires that you will act as Purser to the Flirt
and Ostego, having no officer of that Class at its disposal.
For the purpose of aiding you in the Discharge of this duty, you are
allowed a Clerk, or other responsible person, for whose conduct you
will be held accountable.
Commander Mayo has been ordered to return to the north with the
Poinsett, and directed to leave his barges at Tea Table Key, for your
use, should you require them.
I enclose for your information memorandums respecting various
Harbours on the Coast of Florida prepared by Lieuts Clark and
Peters of the Revenue Service.
Before sailing you will transmit to the Department a complete
Muster Roll of the Officers and Crew of the Flirt.*
I am respectfully Your obed" Servt

BRIGADIER GENERAL Z. TAYLOR Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, It was intended by the order of the 30" of August last,” that
the three hundred men, which it provided might be raised and com-
manded by the Governor of Florida, should be of such a description
as he might think proper to embody, whether mounted or unmounted,
or a combination of both. Hence the order contained no restriction
on that point. It was further intended that this force, according to
its character, should be furnished with every description of supplies
authorized by the regulations for a similar force. From your letter
of the 18" of September last," acknowledging the receipt of the order,
the department feels satisfied that the Governor thought proper that
the force should be mounted, that it was mustered into the service as
such, and that you took measures to have it provided with every
description of supplies to which it was entitled. You will see, how-
ever, from the enclosed copy of a letter from the Honorable C. Down-
ing, addressed to the President," that it is represented that the Officers
of the Army, detailed for the duty of furnishing them with supplies,
have refused to provide them with forage. If this has been the case,
I have to request that you will see that the mistake is corrected in the
proper manner.
I will thank you for a full and early report showing of what descrip-
tion of troops the force in question consisted—what was its strength as
mustered into the service—what were your directions in regard to its
being furnished with supplies—what were furnished and especially

Department, viz: on the 14" ultimo,” and offered no excuse whatever
for not having made the deposite. You were also under instructions
before those—and repeated more than once, to deposit your funds on
hand at Savannah which you entirely neglected. Whether your
subsequent payment to the Commissioners on certain Florida claims,
without any authority whatever, and in direct violation of former
orders to put the balance in the Treasury at Savannah, can be received
or not, is now undergoing inquiry. In respect to your explanations

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[December 26, 1839]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled
The Memorial of the undersigned citizens of East Florida, humbly
sheweth, That great inconvenience being now experienced from the
distance at which the public Lands lying in this section of the Country
are exposed for sale, that by far the greater part of the public lands
which are now entered at the Land office at S*Augustine being situated
more particularly within the counties of Alachua & Columbia; that
many persons who would otherwise become purchasers, are now
deterred therefrom by inability to visit the Land office at St Augustine
and consequently that sales are greatly retarded, and many who
are entitled to the same by the right of pre-emption, are subjected to
great loss and inconvenience which would otherwise render their
improvements more valuable; that great delay is also made in the
rapid settlement and improvement of the country in consequence of
the great distance to the Land office; that they believe that by careful
examination of the entries of land made at the Land office at S*
Augustine, it will be found that by far the greater part of the Lands
which for many months past have been entered at said office are
* The termination of Call's tenure as governor was Dec. 31, 1839, his last
quarterly salary payment, Jan. 16, 1840, in the sum of $625.00, was for the
period Oct. 1-Dec. 31 (inclusive), 1839 (NA, GAO, Misc. Treas. Accts., No.
78,601). Reid took the oath of office on Dec. 28, 1839 (Fla. Terr. Govrs. Let.
Bk. in LC, Records of the States of the U.S., E.2, Microfilm). His resignation
from office of Superior Court Judge for East Florida, Dec. 26, 1839, is in NA

situated in the section of country lying between the S" John's and the
Suwannee rivers, and that all or nearly all of the valuable land, lying
in the vicinity of S*Augustine (of which there is but a small portion)
are already entered; that in order to transact business at the Land
office the citizens particularly, as well as many others are compelled
to travel a distance of from one to two hundred miles to S*Augustine,
through (at present) a part of the country which is exposed to Indian
depredations that citizens residing in distant parts of the country
often visit the counties of Columbia & Alachua who are desirous of
entering Land but are deterred from doing so in consequence of the
distance to the Land office; that there is a large portion of the Public
Lands lying in said counties which are daily sought for and not sold
in consequence of said distance—that this section of country is
every day advancing in importance & improvement so far as its
present condition will allow, and only requires that the savage enemy,
which is now laying disturbing its peace and prosperity be expelled
and it will soon be known and appreciated, as it really is the garden
of the South.
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray, that your Honorable body
will give such consideration to their wishes as expressed in this
memorial and that you will pass an act to establish a Land office at
Newnansville in the county of Alachua East Florida—and your
petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.—

DELEGATE DOWNING TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA: SD, Misc. Letters: ALS]
- Decr 29, 1839
SIR I learned yesterday, that charges had been made against
Sam H. Duvall Marshall of Middle Florida, & that in consequence
of those charges, you had directed the Sec. of the Trea. to Settle M’
Duvalls account. I did not see the letter containing the charges. I
saw the name of the Writer, as written by M. Millar & believe it to be
fictitious.
But sir the object of this letter is to shew you, that the balance
standing against M” Duvall on the books of the Treasury, furnished
no evidence of his indebtedness, but the contrary.
M” Duvall disburses public money annually to the Amount of 15 or
20 thousand dollars—the average expense of his several courts, will be
found, by the books of the Treasury, to amount to that sum—for 16
months, Mr Duvall has borne the expenses of these courts, without
aid from the Treasury—The last advance or remittance made to him,
was on the 26th day of Sept 1838. It will be seen then at once, that
if M" Duvall has rec’d nothing from the Treasury for sixteen months
or for five quarters, to pay the expenses of the several District Courts
of Middle Florida, & the Court of Appeals at Tallahassee, which
average more than $15000 p” An. that he cannot be a defaulter—
I beg leave to state, that the sickness of M" Duvall has been the
sole cause of his failure to render his accounts—I had the pleasure to
introduce him to you at the W* Springs, in the summer of 1839—He
visited the same springs during the last summer–He was here in
Oct' anxiously waiting his accounts, which he said he had ordered his
Deputy to forward—& expressed much vexation at not finding them—
Since his return, his health has been, as I learn, rapidly declining—
I have written to him to forward his accounts, at once,

I beg of you therefore, Sir, not to listen to the charges of men, who
if real & existent, are not known to you, in prefering charges, against
the best officers of our territory and above all, not to remove, an
honest man, now dying with the Consumption, on a charge of delin-
quency, which a close examination of the books of the Treasury will
confute; Nor, for a failure to render in his accounts, made impossible,
by continued Sickness—give him at least, a hearing ”

SAMUEL H. DUVAL Esqr. U.S. Marshal M. Dist. Florida.
SIR, Upon representations being made to the President, that you
are in arrears in your accounts with the U. States, an enquiry into
the matter was, by his direction, made at the Treasury, from the re-
sult of which it appears that, in the adjustment of your accounts, as
far as rendered, a balance of over $9000 is due by you. This fact has
been reported to the President, by whom I am directed to express to
you his opinion, that said balance should be forthwith accounted for
as the best answer to any impeachment of your official conduct."—

PRESENTMENT BY THE GRAND JURY OF FRANKLIN
COUNTY 42
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.: AC]
[December 1839]
TO THE HON. RICHARD C. ALLEN Judge of the Superior Court for
the District of Apalachicola, West Florida, December Term 1839.
The Grand Jurors of the County of Franklin in retiring from the
discharge of the duties which have devolved upon them, cannot re-
frain from presenting the want of a Court House and Jail as a serious
Evil to the public. We are fully aware of the great inconvenience to
which the Court is subjected from the want of a suitable building for
a Court House, and of the great difficulty of enforcing the laws or
preserving public order without a Jail.
The City of Apalachicola being situated at the mouth of a large
and navigable River, must always be a place of such commercial im-
40 Post, p. 47.
* Answered post, p. 49.
* Transmitted with a covering letter of Dec. 17, 1839, from Judge Allen to

portance as to require that a District Court of the United States
should be regularly held here even after the Territory shall have be-
come a State, and therefore these buildings will always be required
by the General Government. It is understood that the City Council
are prepared to convey a suitable lot of land to the General Govern-
ment, provided an appropriation should be made for this purpose.
The consideration of these facts induces us most respectfully to re-
quest our Delegate in Congress. the Hon. Charles Downing, to use
all due exertion to procure an appropriation from Congress for the
purpose of building a Court House and Jail in this city. In calling
the attention of the Court to this subject we would most respectfully
request that a copy of this presentment be forwarded to our Delegate
in Congress, with such representations from your Honour as you may
deem expedient to accomplish this object.
We further call the attention of the Court to the subject of a
Marine Hospital at the port of Apalachicola. The Commerce of this
port is now large and rapidly increasing, as will be seen by the official
returns from the Custom House. Its Foreign, Coasting, and River
trade necessarily employs a large number of seamen. In other ports
throughout the United States this useful but proverbially improvident
class of citizens have been wisely provided for by the erection of
Hospitals by Government, to the maintenance of which the wages of
the seamen contribute. At the present time, notwithstanding the
efforts of the collector to provide for them, sick and disabled seamen
suffer from want of accomodations and attendance suited to their
enfeebled condition. We deem it unnecessary to speak of the obli-
gation, felt by all, to care for, and supply the wants of seamen whose
services to the country in peace or war, are invaluable, and whose
disregard of self but adds to the obligation—we therefore, after pre-
senting to the notice of the Court the absence of suitable Hospital
accomodations and attendance, and the necessity for their provision,
ask such representations from your Honour as may aid the estab-
lishment of a Marine Hospital at Apalachicola by Congress.
We also present for consideration the situation of Franklin County
in regard to School Lands. The munificience of Government has
caused a reserve of a certain quantity of land in each Township
throughout the public Lands for the use of schools. This County
being located on a private land-claim contains no such reserves, while
the rapid increase of population causes the want of a school fund to
be seriously felt. Your Honour is therefore requested to notice the
subject in your representations to Congress, through our Delegate,
with a view to obtain an appropriation of a section of the public
lands in the Territory for purposes of education in this county.

assistance to the civil Authority in apprehending Willis Alston.” In

decline ordering upon this duty any portion of my own Troop or of
the detachment of K Troop, which is now subject to my controll.
In refusing to accede to your Excellency's wishes on this point I deem
it proper to inform you that the instructions from the commanding
General admit of no delay on my part and also to inform you, that
the Soldiers of the regular army, cannot be called upon to enforce the
mandates of the civil authority until that authority has been set at
defiance. I beg leave to remark that in the present instance such is

BRIGADIER GENERAL Z. TAYLOR Tallahassee, Florida.
GENERAL, From the enclosed copy of a letter this day addressed to
the Mayor of St Augustine, you will perceive that your letter of the
29" Ultimo has been received,” and that your delaying to comply
with the order on the subject of mustering into the service the force
which he had permission to raise, is approved. The Department
being satisfied with the precautions taken by you for the protection

Hereafter no force will be authorized unless deemed necessary by

F. L. DANCY Esquire Mayor of S." Augustine, S*Augustine, Florida.
SIR, When by my letter of the 17" ultimo,” I acquiesced in your
application to be permitted to raise a company of mounted men for
the defence of the country adjacent to S' Augustine, I was not aware
of the ample measures taken by General Taylor for that purpose. A
letter has just been received from him, from which it appears that
the force in that quarter was quite large, and has been increased
since the recent murders near S" Augustine, and that he has taken
other and efficient steps for the Security of that part of the country,
so that the force proposed to be raised by you, will be quite unneces-
sary. In view of these facts, and of the obligations resting upon the
Department to keep the expenditures in Florida within the smallest
possible compass, consistent with its duty of affording adequate pro-
tection to the Country, I feel called upon to withdraw the permission
given you to raise the force, and to countermand the orders which
were given to have it mustered into the service, which has been done.

By the reports received from the commanding General in Florida,

killed.
It is however proper to state, that, on application to the Indian
Bureau, I have just been informed by the Commissioner of Indian

Indians have been removed from Florida to the Western country.—

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 11." Instant," requesting, in consequence of a communication
from Governor Call, to know the reasons of his removal.
They are partly contained in the accompanying copy of a letter
addressed by me to the President," and partly in the declaration
made by Governor Call in his letter to General Nelson, dated
September the 5" 1839," in which he avows his intention to use his
best efforts to provide for an Army to Act under the Authority of the
Territory—a measure which never could be acquiesced in by the
Government
You will perceive from these reasons that, no disgrace was attached
to his removal—He thought proper to assume an attitude opposed
to this Department, and his continuance in Office, was, therefore,
deemed incompatible with the interests of the public service."

RESOLUTIONS.
Resolved, by the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, That
a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives be
appointed in such manner as the respective houses may deem proper,
which said committee shall consist of three members from each house
to examine and inspect the books of the Union Bank of Florida,
containing the rules, regulations, ordinances and proceedings of said
bank, so as to ascertain the names of the stockholders, the number
of shares owned by each, and the amount lent to each on pledge of

the bank in its vaults, and what steps have been taken towards a
resumption of specie payments at an early day, the amount of cash
on hand, the amount of notes in circulation, the balance due to and
from other banks, the amount of deposites, the amount of bills, notes,
or bonds discounted, and all other affairs of said bank, so as to know
its true situation, and be enabled to make a true report thereof to
the Legislative Council, as far as may be, without examing the indi-
vidual accounts of the customers of the said bank, and also that said
committee have leave to employ one or two competent clerks, and
that said committee be empowered to send for persons and papers,
and to administer an oath to all persons whom they may see fit to
examine in relation to the affairs of said bank.
Resolved, That the Governor of the Territory be, and he is hereby
requested to appoint a commissioner, not a member of either House,
to proceed to Pensacola, to examine fully into the management of
the Bank of Pensacola, and to make report thereof, to the Governor,
for the information of the Legislative Council.
Resolved, That a joint committee of one from the Senate and one
from the House of Representatives, be appointed in such manner as
the respective houses may deem proper, to proceed without delay to
St. Augustine, there to inspect the books and minutes of proceedings
of the board of Trustees of the Southern Life Insurance and Trust
Company—to ascertain the amount of deposits therein—an exact
list of balances due to and from said body politic and corporate, and

Resolved, That the Commissioner appointed by the Governor to
examine into the affairs of the Bank of Pensacola, be allowed such
compensation as may be deemed reasonable by the Governor, not
exceeding 200 dollars—and that the members of the joint committee,
appointed to examine into the affairs of the Southern Life Insurance
and Trust Company, be allowed the same compensation which is
allowed by act of Congress to members of the Legislative Council,
for travelling to and from St. Augustine, to be paid out of the Ter-
ritorial Treasury.
Said joint resolutions were, on the 24th day of the same month,
transmitted by the Secretary to the House of Representatives of the
Legislative Council of Florida, for their action thereon: and whereas
this Senate have not, up to the present day, (being the last day of its
present session) received from the said House of Representatives any
response upon the subject of the said joint resolutions, therefore,
Be it known to the people of Florida, That this Senate holds itself
absolved from any reproach which attaches to the Legislative Council

ZACHARY TAYLOR TO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL
[NA:GLO, Abandoned Mil. Reservation File, Box 14:C]
Head Quarters Army of the South,
FORT FANNING, F., January 27, 1840.
SIR, In the present state of the war the depot at the Cedar Keys,
now in course of completion, is of great importance, as from it, by
means of Steam boats penetrating the Suwannee and other rivers
which empty into the Gulf, the Several military posts in Middle, and
most of those in East Florida west of the St. John's river can better be
Supplied than from any other point. These Keys have never yet been
Surveyed and offered for Sale and therefore not Subject to entry, but
settlements on them may be attempted with the view to future claims,
and it being highly important that citizens should be excluded from
them during the continuance of operations, I have to request that
they be reserved for Military purposes. The outer Key of the group
the Government should retain, as on it will no doubt be erected, at
some future time, a light house for the benefit of vessels trading to
the Suwannee River.

SECRETARY MCCANTS TO THE PRESIDENT
[LC:Van Buren Papers:ALS]
(private) TALLAHASSEE Fla Janry 30th 1840
HON. M. VAN BUREN
Sir Although I have not the honor of a personal acquaintance
with you, I have the honor of holding office by your appointment "
and under your administration—This warrants me in addressing you
a private letter, tendering my thanks for the confidence you have
manifested in me and my friend whose kindness recommended me to
your consideration—The good will of the community in which I have
lived for eight years has on several occasions confided to me important
trusts, and my great happiness has been to receive their approbation
of my conduct while acting for them—In 1836 I was a member of the
Legislative Council In 1838 I was a member of the Convention which
formed a Constitution for the future state of Florida—My appoint-
ment to office of Secretary was unsolicited and wholly unexpected—
Indeed my rule of life has been not to seek office, but to wait until
my services were desired by the public–
The condition of this Territory at the present is very interesting—
The prosperity of Florida is struggling with difficulties, which seem too
great to be overcome—The industry of the Country diminished and
hindered by a distressing war is paying an interest on nearly
$4,000.000—and in addition a heavy and unjust tribute to luxury and
privilege—Agriculture which is the staple industry of the land must
bear their difficulties and if ever done must overcome them—Indeed
when on the one hand I consider the ordinary profits of Agriculture,
and on the other its liabilities and embarrassments, it seems impossible
to entertain any hope of a successful issue-
To the abuses of the credit system we owe for the greater part our
present condition—A few persons have obtained and used the public
credit in procuring nearly $4.000.000—This fund has been thrown over
the country producing dependence and indebtedness paralizing to
industry and frugality, while they stimulate extravagance, and
idleness and riskless speculation—The effect of this state of things upon
the morals of community is perceptible—The poorer classes find no
reward in a course of honest enterprise and prudence—Without

default they must bear a share and a large share of the prevailing
embarrassments—They are looked upon too with disdain by those
who have caused their distresses and who feed upon their substance.
They become discontented, and thus the class of profligate idle is
continually increasing—
In this conjunction of affairs you perceive, Sir, we have but small
encouragement to labor. Nevertheless for 12 months or longer the
democratic party in Florida has been laboring with unceasing efforts—
And until very recently we have been doing so without that parental
assistance from the general government which we hope hereafter to
possess—If the measures of your administration are opposed by men
high in Office they cannot but be hindered and often defeated—I feel
great interest in the success of your measures relative to the revenue
and the currency throughout the United States—But their influence
and success in Florida is most sincerely to be desired—For although
their immediate effect is to maintain the credit and character of our
National Government and shew the permanent value of the consti-
tutional currency, their tendency must check the abuses of the credit
system and their demoralizing influences—
The appointment of Gov. Reid was highly gratifying to me and to
many—While engaged in forming the Constitution of Florida I became
intimately acquainted with him—And as we fought under the same
banner, I was able to learn, and, learning, to approve and esteem the
motives and principles of his public conduct—In short he is, Sir, an
honor to Florida and I hope he will long live to enjoy the confidence
of a grateful people—
I am Sir very respectfully Your Obt. Servt.

HIS EX. ROBT R. REID Govr of Florida
SIR, Your letter of the 29" ult" " urging the appointment of a
successor to Mr. Duval in the office of Marshal for Middle Florida
has been received and laid before the President. Mr. Duval's term
of service will not expire until Septr 1841, and his accounts, towards
the condition of which the attention of the accounting officers had
been directed, have recently undergone an investigation, the result of
which is entirely satisfactory. This being the case, and this Depart-
ment having received no information of a specific character, from
which any inference can be drawn unfavorable to the expediency of
Mr. Duval's continuance in office, the President is unable to act upon
your suggestion; but directs that you may be called upon to furnish
this Department with any information of the character referred to
which may be in your hands, or within your reach."
I am &c.
Signed—JOHN FORSYTH.

Whereas by an act of Congress, passed the 26th day of May 1824”
“a pre-emption of one quarter section each, is granted to the several
Counties, and parishes of each state or Territory of the United States,
where there are public lands, for the establishment of seats of Justice
therein, for said Counties and parishes respectively; and in Con-
formity with the supposed intention of Congress, as indicated by
said Act, the proper authority of some of the Counties, in the Terri-
tory of Florida have located and sold a quarter section of land, on
which the seats of Justice of their Counties, have not been located,
and have applied the proceeds of the same, to the erection of Court
Houses and jails in their Counties.—And whereas from the situation
of the locality, and population of the Territory in many of the Coun-
ties, the location of the seats of Justice, on land belonging to the
United States can not be made without great inconvenience, and

emanating from the general Land office in this Territory, based upon
the opinion of the Solicitor of one of the Bureau's of that department
it is declared that, the right to pre-emption, can only be claimed, by
those Counties, which have or may locate their seats of Justice on
the quarter section applied for, and that all locations otherwise made,
are void—Which decision will work an exclusion of a large portion of
the Counties, in this Territory, from a participation, in the County
which it is believed was intended by the government, and much to
the injury of those persons who have purchased land located and
sold by some Counties under a construction of the statute, different
from the one given by the Solicitor
Be it therefore Resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council
of the Territory of Florida
That our Delegate in Congress be, and he is hereby requested, to
present the subject to the Congress of the United States and use all
means in his power to procure the passage of a law authorising the
several Counties in this Territory, which have not located a quarter
section for the establishment of seats of justice therein, to make such
location as will be most beneficial to their Counties, without reference
to the location of the seats of Justice thereon, and to sell the same
applying the proceeds to the erection of Public Buildings of their
Counties; and also to confirm such sales as have been made by
counties the proceeds of which have been vested in the public
buildings of their counties.

Whereas by reason of the long pending and still pending lawsuit
between the United States and the apalachicola Land Company” in
regard to the title to the land at the Junction of the St Marks and
Waculla Rivers in Leon County Florida, the town of St Marks is
greatly retarded in its growth and prosperity, and the interest of the
residents of said place and the public convenience greatly prejudiced,
said Land being in consequence with held from sale by both parties;
and whereas the said Apalachicola Land Company agree to a sale of
aforesaid Lands in lots on equitable terms:—the proceeds to be held
subject to the final decision of the Supreme Court of the United
States as to said title.—
It is therefore Resolved by the House of Representatives of the
Territory of Florida, that the Congress of the United States be re-
spectfully requested to pass a law at as early a period as possible
as pessible of the present session, authorising the sale of said Town
in Town lots upon such equitable terms as to the proceeds of such sales
as may be agreed upon between the U.S. and said company and that
in such sales the rights and interest of said residents who have made
Improvements on said lots should be protected as in the former Law
of Congress respecting the sale of said Town and that a copy hereof be

Mr. Hawkins* from the committee to whom was referred that
portion of the Governor's Message in relation to the division of the
Territory offers the following Report.

and principally found in its Eastern portion, contend, that owing to

the diversity and contrariety of interests and opinions subsisting be-
tween East and Middle and West Florida, and the large extent of
domain embraced within those divisions, propriety, justice, and a
proper regard for the interests of all, demand, that a separation and
dismemberment should take place.
Your committee cannot concur in these views and opinions, and
differ as to its expediency and justice.
Political communities, like individuals, will certainly become
estranged in their feelings, if they wish and resolve to be so; but the
strongest tie of affinity which can exist between them is that where all
parties of that community are mutually dependent upon each other,
living under the same laws and possessing the same interests. Under
this state of things, any diversity of feeling would soon pass away and
a people connected with these ties, would in a short period become as
One.
In case there were two states or territories, the cause of internal
improvements would receive a severe shock, and instead of having
railroads and canals throughout the whole extent of our present terri-
tory, they would in all probability be confined to small and limited
districts, for it would be extremely problematical, whether the two
future states would co-operate in any enterprise for the construction
of those works across their respective domains, with that cordiality
so requisite to ensure success.
Florida, from the general features of its country, its admirable adap-
tation to works of this nature, must in the course of human events, be
the country over which will be constructed a work that will unite the
Gulf of Mexico with the Atlantic by railroad or canal; and when com-
pleted, while bringing the people of either extreme and other portions
into frequent contact, will create that most potent of all cements
interest, with its concomitants, harmony and regard.
For a considerable period of time, there cannot exist amongst us
the wealth requisite to carry through the works alluded to, and to
stimulate individual enterprise, it might be necessary perhaps to in-
voke the aid of the state, either by partaking in it, or lending its
assistance by legislative enactments, offering such inducements and
conferring such privileges, as would tempt capitalists to embark in
the undertaking.—If two states existed, it is but fair to suppose, that
obstacles would be much increased by questions arising, involving
sovereignty, right of soil and expediency, and which would tend to
render abortive all schemes of this nature.
Should division ensue, emigration to either territory would be
seriously retarded, for citizens of the states, with their notions of the

wild and loose legislation generally found in territories, will be loth to
leave homes where life and property are secured by salutary laws, to
seek new ones in a country where the constituted authorities are not
amenable to the people for any dereliction from duty, where they will
have no voice in the selection of rulers, who are generally sent from
abroad, and in all respects as dependent upon the will of Congress, as
the colonies were upon Great Britain, previous to the revolution.
Chancellor Kent on this subject, uses the following language, and
which your committee deem pertinent to the subject under considera-
tion—“Such a state of absolute sovereignty on the one hand, and of
absolute dependence on the other, is not congenial with the free and
independent spirit of our native institutions; and the establishment of
distant territorial governments, ruled according to will and pleasure,
would have a very natural tendency, as all proconsular governments
have had, to abuse and oppression.
The territory is bound for the redemption of certain bonds, and the
whole territory is so bound. It may be contended, that as a territory,
we had no power to pass laws binding on the future state, though the
case in II Martin's Reports, State v. New Orleans N. Company,
seems to militate against that position; yet be it as it may, the question
of ratifying or denying the pledges made may come up for future
disquisition and future action. Might not East Florida contend, that
inasmuch as she had not received an equal portion or share of the
benefits of the Union and Pensacola Banks, that equity would decree
that she should not be bound for the responsibilities incurred by the
territory for those Institutions? In case the holders of the bonds
issued should fail in receiving the interest on them, and should have
recourse on the territories or states for payment, the most selious ques-
tions would arise, fraught with embarrassment and perplexing in their
nature. That there would be efforts made to shift responsibilities
from one state to the other, little doubt can exist, and a never ending
source of dispute would be created between them, while a singular
spectacle would be exhibited of two sovereign states quarrelling and
wrangling, which should or should not assume liabilities contracted
jointly.
Already has Congress, by its munificience, given large sums of money
for our public buildings at the present site of our capitol. Those
works are now in progress and will soon be completed. If a new
territory should be formed, the citizens of West Florida would con-
tend most strenuously for the removal of the present capitol to a more
western and central position, and if the ends of justice were attained,
a new site would be selected, and again large sums lavished upon it
by the General Government. The contest growing out of the question
as to the location of this site, would inevitably give rise to angry

and violent discussion. A question might here arise, how far that
country is in the main benefitted by those acts of pecuniary liberality,
and if they have not a tendency to teach and accustom us to be mere
dependents on the bounty of Government, and while palsying our
industry, render us careless and neglectful of our own resources
It is urged as an argument in favor of division, both here and else-
where, that it is a southern measure, and by creating two states, in
lieu of one, the balance of the union will be better preserved. Years
must elapse, ere in case of separation, the two states could have more
than one member in the popular branch of the national legislature,
though it may be granted, that two senators would be gained. The
confederacy being created in a spirit of compromise, and based on the
virtue and intelligence of the people; to that virtue and intelligence
it must be indebted for its permanence and endurance.
That day will indeed be a dark one for the cause of freedom in our
Country and the stability of our Union, when the vote of a small
state can decide its destinies, and the ballots of two Senators are
the only barriers between revolution and anarchy. The union of the
States would hang together but by a brittle tenure, and like the sword
suspended by a single hair over the head of Damocles, would ruin and
destruction impend over our country. If there were but one state,
the members of the Congressional House of Representatives would
increase more rapidly than if there were two: for in the first instance,
there would not be two distinct fractions of numbers over and above
the ratio of representation; whereas in the latter case, these fractions
would more or less exist, and if added together, might enable one state
to have an additional and one other Representative.
Your committee are of opinion, that the moral and political influ-
ence of one large and respectable State would be greater and more
deeply felt in the councils of the Nation, than that exercised by two
smaller ones, equalling, when united, the one State. In the first, there
being but one people to be represented, one in interest and united in
policy, its representatives would naturally act in that concert which
would tend to produce more important and happier results, than if
separated in two portions, and divided politically and in interest.
In case of war, a single state by a concentration of its resources
would be more efficient in repelling an enemy than two weak and in-
effective ones; for should such a crisis or event take place, and always
likely to do so from conflicts between the General Government and
foreign nations, Florida indubitably would be deemed the weak point
to be assailed, the point d'appui from which an assault would be made
as well on the peculiar Domestic Institutions of our Territory, as those
of the whole Southern portions of the Confederacy.

It might afford a curious problem in political arithmetic worthy of
solution to ask, how long a period of time would elapse (should the
sought for division occur) ere the two Territories would possess suffi-
cient population to enter the Confederacy. It is true, that States
may have been taken in, without possessing the ratio of representation
at the time of their admission. There is every reason to suppose, that
the present ratio, will be increased on the completion of the census,
and it is equally probable, that it will continue so to increase hand in
hand with the population of the Union and that it will outstrip the
increase of our own population. If Congress should decide, that we
must come up to that ratio, whatever it may be, difficult as it would
be for our present Territory, how utterly impossible, at least for a
long time, would it be for two territories.
From the spirit of deadly hostility manifested in certain portions
of the union to the admission of new slave States, there are well
grounded fears, that in the ratio as the time is postponed for our
admission, so will that spirit display itself by throwing obstacles and
barriers in our way. There are unquestionable proofs of that feeling
gaining ground, if we are permitted to judge from the criteria furnished
us by Executive messages, Judicial decisions, local laws and the
refusal to deliver up those fugitives from justice, who after being
guilty of the most serious infractions of the laws of slave holding
states, have fled for protection to those states, where slavery is not
acknowledged, and availed themselves of it under their municipal
regulations.
Let us not be deluded by the “cry of peace, peace, when there is
no peace,” let us not be told, that a sect who under the specious guise
of philanthrophy are now warring against our dearest rights and
endeavoring to snap the chord that binds out Confederacy, a sect,
who have “stolen their banners from the altars of Christ, and congre-
gated their allies from the abysses of Hell,” are but few in number
and that their efforts will prove futile and vain; when they boast of
rapidly increasing numbers, that they have controlled the elections
of the largest state of the Union, that the Legislature of a sovereign
state has instructed its representatives in Congress to vote against
the admission of any state tolerating slavery, it is time for a Territory,
where slavery exists and coming within the purvieu of those instruc-
tions, to look to itself and oppose a division, that might tend to render
those instructions available against it. Iowa and Wisconsin, are
nearly ready to enter the Union, and before we could hope to set off
our strength against these in Congress as two States, an issue may be
made and decided in relation to the questions above alluded to, and
we become the victims of its consequences and results. It is urged,

that East Florida, assisted by the bill for the armed occupation of
Florida and now before Congress, would of itself soon be prepared to
enter the Union. This argument is used by some Southern States-
men in favor of the bill, independent of its being the means of ending
the war; and they contend, that its passage would go far to produce
results favorable to keeping up the balance of the confederacy. The
bill is not yet a law, and should it become so, though your committee
are in favor of it, yet, would its passage induce that kind of population
to avail themselves of its provisions and settle amongst us, who would
be considered as valuable acquisitions further than mere numbers?
Those, allured hither by the inducements held out in the bill, would
unquestionably be a hardy and enterprising race of yeomanry, their
only wealth, stout hands and hearts, their rifles and munitions of war.
Not till the termination of the war, an event extremely uncertain,
would the lands be given them and not till then, would their swords
be turned to plough shares, or would they cultivate that soil, they had
won by their valor. Something more than mere numerical strength
is to be sought for in a State and it must depend for its support upon
that pecuniary fund created by, and arising from its agricultural and
commercial resources. The bill alluded to is as yet an untried ex-
pedient and its results cannot be foretold or safely calculated upon;
and your committee contend, that the rights of the people of Florida
should not be subject to the hazard of an experiment, a dernier resort
to end a long protracted and ruinous war.
But, admitting all that its advocates ask, Middle and West Florida
have a right to look to East Florida for its co-operation and assistance
in their efforts to become a State, when they can be asked without
doing injustice to any portion of the whole Territory. They have a
right to invoke its aid, and become partakers of the burthens incident
to a State Government, and as an equivalent therefor, to share in the
benefits. If she acted otherwise, she should not be guided by that side
of justice that should characterize the people of a common Territory.
It cannot be denied, that the domain under the appellation of
Florida, is sufficiently large for two States; but it should be recollected
that a comparatively small portion of it will admit of successful
cultivation, or repay the husbandman for his labors; that those por-
tions susceptible of that cultivation are scattered in bodies, and their
cultivators, in many instances, will have to depend for getting their
produce to market, upon the Internal improvements already referred
to. Florida could cover many Rhode Islands or Delawares, but as
yet, she has not, and it may be long ere she has the population of
those states.
In the treaty between Spain and the United States, for the cession
of East and West Florida, there is a guaranty in these words: “The

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 75
inhabitants of the Territories which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the
United States, by this treaty, shall be incorporated in the union of
the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles
of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to all the privileges, rights
and immunities of the citizens of the United States.”
The division sought for, would conflict with the letter and spirit
of this provision of the Treaty, and deprive us of a right by postponing
the period of incorporation unto the union of the United States. It
was the evident intention of Spain, the ceding power and party of the
compact, that the provinces ceded should be considered as one and
indivisible, and be admitted as such. The words “East and West
Florida” are mere terms of description, including one domain; and
so must they have been understood by the United States at the
time, for since the treaty, they have been included in one Territorial
Government; if otherwise, they would have been severed.
After the cession of Mississippi to the United States by Georgia, the
permission of Georgia to divide it, was first asked and obtained; but
the people of the Territory objected, and asked permission from Con-
gress to enter the Union. The committee of Congress, to whom was
referred their petition for admission, in the report used this language:
“It is known to your committee, that the consent of Georgia to a
division of this Territory, has been asked and obtained, and should it
be divided before it is admitted, the admission of either part would,
from a want of members, be subject to additional objection and
further delay. But doubts were entertained, whether the Territory
can, with strict propriety, be divided without the consent of its in-
habitants, as well as that of Georgia and the United States. Although
the people of the Territory had no agency in the agreement above
granted, they were the object of it, and as such became a third party
to it, and vested by it of a right which is explicitly defined.”
Your committee would direct the attention of your honorable body
to the strong and complete analogy existing between Florida as
she is, and Mississippi as she was; and adopting the language and
reasoning of this report, we contend that inasmuch as we were the
objects of the Treaty with Spain, we constitute a third party to it, and
before we are dismembered, we have a right to be heard. If division
should be decided upon by a majority of the whole people of Florida,
the minority must silently acquiesce; and if on the other hand, the
minority should only be in favor of that division and opposed to the
majority, they, too, should give way to the largest number. Your
committee deem these propositions to be in strict accordance with
the spirit and principles of republican institutions.
The people of Florida have solemnly decided on a State Govern-
ment—that question has been acted upon in compliance with a law

passed by their representatives. A Convention of the people has
been held, and a Constitution has been formed. If we are to be
denied admission, the refusal to admit us must be based upon some-
thing else than a proje’t at variance, and inconsistent with our rights—
the point to the treaty of Spain as the guaranty of those rights, and
placing us on a level with other citizens of our country. Upon that
treaty we throw ourselves, and if we comply with the requisitions
of the Constitution necessary to admittance, we do not come as
mere suppliants, begging to be admitted into our great Confederacy:
but with that charter in one hand, and the Constitution in the other
we demand as matter of right, as a sovereign State, with sovereign
rights to be taken into the family of the American Republic.
Your committee beg leave to offer the following resolutions, all
which is respectfully submitted.
Regarding any law of Congress dividing the Territory of Florida
without the consent of the majority of our whole People, as unjust
to us, unconstitutional and invalid.
We hereby respectfully, but solemnly and earnestly protest against
the passage of any such law, as militating against these rights secured
to us by the Treaty with Spain, and the laws of the land, and
Be it resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council of the Territory
of Florida, That our Delegate in Congress be instructed to oppose the
passage of any law dividing our Territory, by separating East and
South Florida from Middle and West Florida or in any other way or
manner.
Be it further Resolved, That copies of this Protest and Resolution,
after due authentication, be forwarded to the Honorable Charles

taken by the majority of the committee, and begs leave to submit the
following report on the subject referred to, which was read, and with
certain resolutions, 200 copies ordered to be printed.
REPORT.
The subject offered for the consideration of the committee, is
certainly one of grave and serious import, calculated to exert a most
vital influence over the destinies of Florida, and to effect its interests
for the present, and through all future times, whilst the course urged
by the majority, will embarrass, if not ultimately defeat the accom-
plishment of a great southern measure, prompted by a strictly southern
policy.
It cannot be denied that the signs of the times, and the demonstra-
tions of hostility to southern institutions, point out to us most em-
phatically, the necessity of arming for the coming contest, so that
we may offer an effectual resistance to the evident disposition to
encroach on our constitutional privileges. We can but do this by
increasing the number of southern states. To carry out this expedi-
ent, it should be our first object to divide Florida, and urge the admis-
sion of the two territories into the Federal Union as two separate and
independent States. This will give us four Senators, and for the
present, two Representatives in Congress; and then we will present
a more efficient force than can be done by any State having but two
Senators and one Representative.
In reference to the Constitution recently framed at St. Joseph:
and although it embraces many sound and wholesome doctrines, yet
if we look to the votes of the people, we will see how nearly divided is
public sentiment in reference to its adoption. If in fact it be adopted,
the majority does not exceed twenty-one; unquestionably too small
to force upon so large and respectable a minority a measure to which
there has been manifested such determined hostility. But its adop-
tion by the people is not admitted; and the evidence offered is not
satisfactory: on the contrary, it is believed and contended, that if the
votes should be fully and fairly cancelled, it would be found that the
majority for its rejection will be considerable. Enough at least has
been discovered to render it extremely doubtful, and we should
hesitate to force an obnoxious measure upon an unwilling people.
In reference to a division of the Territory, it seems to be suggested
by its practicability and expediency, and because it is a measure
strongly promotive of southern policy, and tends to our own political
good. Each of these territories is much larger than several of the
states, and each capable of receiving and sustaining a much larger
population. Their present union appears to be unnatural, and their

geographical position will present a state of a most awkward shape,
whilst a controversy and confliction of interests growing out of it,
will forever destroy that harmony so essential to the prosperity of a
political body.
This seems to have been the view taken of the Floridas by every
other government which has had dominion over them. Originally
as Spanish Provinces, they were separately governed, and independent
of each other. In this way they were ceded by Spain to Great Britain
in 1763. They continued separate provinces under that government:
and when they were afterwards receded by Great Britain to Spain in
1783, no change was made; and which, by the treaty of cession in
1819, between Spain and the United States, they were ceded to the
latter, they were ceded as separate territories, known as East and
West Florida.
The Government of the United States seems to have regarded
them in this light, for immediately after their cession, although
Gen. Jackson, clothed with the authority of Capt. General of Cuba,
was appointed to govern them, yet two separate offices, in the charac-
ter of Lieut. Governor, were appointed to each of these provinces,
and their present union was originally a measure only of temporary
convenience.
To go now into the Union as one State, will be to surrender, for
considerations of temporary political policy, an advantage whose
importance will only be appreciated by the advocates of State Govern-
ment, after it shall have become too late to retrace their steps. It is
most manifest that the treaty does not contemplate the admission of
the Floridas as one State, but in language that cannot be mistaken, it
secures to the inhabitants of each of these Territories the right of
admission as separate States, as soon as shall be consistent with the
principles of the Federal Constitution.
Whenever mention is made of them in the Treaty, the plural
number is used, and they are spoken of as “The Florida's,” “The
inhabitants of the Ceded Territories,” &c. This view was taken by
Hon. members of the Senate of the United States, when the subject
of division and the Armed Occupation Bill was under discussion.
It was assumed without contradiction, that this right had been
guarantied to the citizens of the two territories. What is meant by
the words in the treaty “as soon as shall be consistent with the
principles of the Federal Constitution,” all may not agree in their
interpretation. By some it may be urged that they refer to the ratio
of representation as it now exists, and others, and not a few, will urge,
with force and ability, that they refer to the ratio of representation,
as it was when the territories were ceded. This last is the ground
assumed by the committee of the Convention at St. Joseph, appointed


## p. 79 (#91) ##############################################

F. L. O. R. I D A T E R R IT OR Y 79
to draft a memorial to the Congress of the United States, in relation
to the admission of Florida as a State into the Federal Union. On
the other hand, it might be insisted, that these words have reference
to the ratio of representation, as it was at the time of the adoption
of the Federal Constitution: and again, that they have no reference
to any ratio of representation.
However, let it be admitted, and it cannot well be denied, that
the treaty of cession has guarantied not to the inhabitants of Florida,
as one province or Territory, but to inhabitants of East and West
Florida, as separate Territories, the right of admission into the Union
as separate and independent States. Then if the argument that the
present ratio of representation is not to be the governing rule, be true,
there is no more to be found in the Federal Constitution against the
admission of the two Territories, as two separate States, than in favor
of their admission as one State.
The people of East Florida are not only opposed to going into a
State Government as one State, believing it to be a measure opposed
to southern interest and southern policy, and prejudicial to the
particular interests of each section, but are decidedly opposed to
going into a State Government at all at present.
The difficulties and embarrassments which they have had, and
still have to struggle with—the ravages and misfortunes inflicted by
a desolating war have destroyed their agriculture, and impoverished
the people so that their situation at this time is one rather to claim
relief than to contribute to the heavy expenses of a State government.
They therefore regard the attempt to force them, against their
wishes and their interests, into a State Government, as in the last
degree, ungenerous, unjust and oppressive, and which they will, by
every means in their power, resist.
Whilst these views are expressed in reference to the wishes and
interests of the people of East Florida, feeling of selfishness will not be
permitted to embarrass the claims of the people of Middle and West
Florida.
In these sections there appears to be manifested an intense anxiety
for a State Government, so far as can be done without prejudice to
themselves, the people of East Florida, will readily aid them in the
measure.
If the views taken of the treaty guaranties be correct, and sustained
as it is, by the opinion of able and talented men, then the people West
of the Suwannee river, are more entitled to admission as a State into
the Federal Union. They have a territory in extent larger than several
of the old states, possessing commercial and agricultural rewards, in-
viting a dense and thrifty population, and which is now sufficient to
render their claims to admission consistent with the principles of the

80 T E R R ITO RIA L PA P E R S
Federal Constitution. And under, and by virtue of the treaty guar-
anty, they ought of right to be admitted immediately into the Federal
Union.
It is therefore respectfully recommended, that a memorial be
drafted and sent to the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States, urging the claim of the people West of the Suwanne
river, to admission as a State into the Federal Union, and the erection
of East Florida into a separate Territorial Government, making a
prospective arrangement for the admission of the latter as soon as
there shall be population to warrant it.
The following resolution is also respectfully submitted:
Resolved, by the Governor, the Senate, and the House of Repre-
sentatives of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, That
our Delegate in Congress be, and he is hereby instructed to use his
best efforts to procure the passage of a law for the immediate admission
as a state into the Federal Union, of all that section of Florida lying
west of the Suwannee river, and for the erection into a separate
Territorial Government of all that portion lying east of said river,
making a prospective arrangement for the admission of the latter as
soon as there shall be sufficient population to warrant it.”
PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF THE
TERRITORY
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred February 24, 1840]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the United
States—
Your petitioners would respectfully represent that they regard the
practice at present existing on the part of the Government of receiving
charges and accusations against those employed in the service of
Government and removing those complained of in such accusations
without informing the person accused who are his accusers, or of what
offence he stands charged—thereby denying to him an opportunity
of refuting them and condemning him unheard is unjust in the ex-
treme and should be corrected by the national Legislature—As long
as covert attacks and secret accusations are encouraged no officer
will find that the discharge of his duties however faithfully and ably

Representatives, Feb. 4, 1840, printed in Dodd, op. cit., pp. 355–362. See also
resolution of the House of Representatives, Feb. 14, 1840 (ibid., pp. 362-363),
condemning any proposal for a division of the territory; and with a protest of the
members of the House from East Florida against approving a plan for division
(ibid., pp. 363-364).

he
executed will form a sufficient shield to protect his reputation against
the silent and subtle assaults of his enemies, who are permitted to
assail him in his absence and are protected and countenanced in their
conduct by those who have authority to act on the charges preferred.
Your petitioners regard the practice alluded to as having the most
baneful tendency and one to which the most vigilant and efficient
officer will often fall a victim while the name of his accuser and the
cause of his accusation are alike unknown to him Your petitioners
respectfully represent that they believe a prominent instance of the
evil of this practice has recently occurred in the removal of Richard
K. Call from the office of Governor of Florida.” As the public
Journals of the Territory rarely if ever spoke of his official conduct
except in terms of approbation and as his zeal and energy in the use
of the limited means under his control in endeavoring to give relief
and protection to our harrassed and distressed Territory were known
to be unceasing it could not have been anticipated that so decisive a
measure would have been adopted without affording this officer an
opportunity of being heard in his defense—But not only has this
opportunity been denied him if your petitioners have been correctly
informed—but it is not yet known for what cause he has been removed
unless the rumor be correct that it has occured in consequence of his
differing in opinion with the War Department of the Government
on the proper mode of terminating the unhappy conflict with the
Seminole Indians If such be the case your petitioners find a double
cause for regret in the removal of this officer as it may be regarded
as a decided indication on the part of that branch of the Government
to conduct the war as heretofore carried on—Your petitioners have
watched with the deepest interest the events of the war and most
of them have been sufferers either directly or indirectly in person,
family or property from its effects and feel themselves called on, on
this occasion to say plainly to Congress that they do not believe
that under the present plan of operations against the enemy the con-
test will ever [be declided. As the operations of the Army do not
usually commence before the months of November or December
(and the present year not until the middle of the last month) and con-
clude in March or April; but a small part of the year generally not
exceeding three and a half or four and a half Months are spent in
the field * during the Summer and Autumn Months—Your peti-

inactivity in summer quarters under the allegation that the army cannot keep
the field” There is a third memorial in the House files also disapproving Call's
removal.

tioners do not profess to be competent to suggest to your honorable
body the most efficient measures to close this unhappy conflict, but
would beg leave to say that none has been presented to their con-
sideration having greater probability of success than those to be
found in the several communications of the late Governor of Florida
with the Secretary of War, and the President of the United States.
More particularly the plan of a military colonization of the country
occupied by the enemy and granting of lands to the settlers as an
inducement to emigration as contained in his last Message to the
Legislature of Florida–And the employment of force calculated for
the service to be kept without interruption in the field until the war
is closed—To prove that the last measure is practicable we need
only refer to the fact that the executive of the Territory has invariably
kept the small force under his command constantly in operation
without respect to the seasons, during which periods they are known
to have suffered less than the same number of regular troops in Sum-
mer quarters.—Your petitioners do not pretend to say that the regular
Army can perform this service—Their ability is best known to the
generals commanding them, but they do state that a force can be
raised in the Southern States capable of performing the duty
mentioned.
Your petitioners therefore pray for the passage of a Law for the
Military colonization of the country at present occupied by the
Seminole Indians and a grant of land to the setlers on the plan
recommended in the last anual [message of]* Governor Call, and a
law for the raising of a permanent force of militia or volunteers to
be kept in active operation until the close of the war—Your petitioners
further pray that a Resolution be passed calling on the President of
the United States for his reasons for the removal of the late Gov' of
Florida and requiring him to lay before Congress the charges against
that officer with the names of the persons preferring them and the
evidence in their support–And for the passage of a law requiring the
President of the United States before removing an officer of Govern-
ment (if in his opinion the case will admit of such delay without
jeopardy to the Public interest) to have him furnished with the
charges preferred against him, the names of his accuser or accusers
and the evidence in their support. And requiring the President
in all instances to furnish Congress with his reasons for the removal
of officers, the names of accusers, and the evidence in support of the
charges—”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY RICHARD K. CALL
[NA: SF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:ADS"]
[February 26, 1840]
To the Senate, and House of Representatives, of the United States of
America, in Congress assembled.
The memorial of R.K. Call—late Governor of the Territory of
Florida, respectfully represents, that your Memorialist was on the 16
day March 1836,” without his knowledge, consent, or application,
with the advice and consent of the Senate appointed by the President
of the United States, Governor of the Territory of Florida, for the period
of Three Years. That Your Memorialist did not accept the said office
of Governor, until he was induced to do so by the petition of a number
of the most respectable Citizens of this Territory. That Your Memori-
alist afterwards accepted, and entered upon the duties of said office,
and continued to perform them, to the best of his abilities until the
25" day Feb 1839, * when your memorialist was reappointed to said
office again, without solicitation, or request on his part, for another
term of three years. That your Memorialist continued zealously and
with unremitted assiduity to perform the duties of Governor of
Florida until the evening of the 24" of December last, when he learned
with some surprise, throught the medium of the News papers that he
had been superceeded in the office of Governor as aforesaid, and that

the Hon’bl. R.R. Reid, Judge of the District of East Florida, had been
appointed his successor.” Although this event has been published,
and republished in the Newspapers from the date of the removal of
your Memorialist until this the 26" of February, and the successor
of your Memorialist has been long since installed in office, Your
Memorialist has received no official information from the Govern-
ment on the subject. He has not been notified of his removal. Nor
has he been advised by the proper Department, —of the names of his
accusers, the offence with which he stands charged, the names of the
witnesses, or the nature of the evidence on which he has been con-
demmed. After judgement, and execution, it may have been deemed
by the Department of State, an idle cerimoney, to inform the accused
of his arraignment, or it may have been considered an office too
humiliating to correspond with one who had fallen under the dis-
pleasure of those in power. But your Memorialist never having felt
himself elevated by the commission of the President, does not by its
loss, feel himself depressed below the grade of respectability; which
would entitle him to be informed of the cause of his removal from
Office. A few days before your memoralist heard of his his being
superceeded, he was informed by a friend, that a petition, praying for
his removal had been secretly circulated among those who had con-
spired against him, and had been forwarded to Washington." The
propriety of sending a counter petition, by the friends of your Me-
morialist," was suggested, but he rejected the proposition, stating to
the friend by whom it was made, that he relied on the propriety of his
own conduct, no less than on the justice of the President of the United
States, that if charges had been made against your memorialist, the
high functionaries of the Government would not condemn him un-
heard, but that they would afford him a fair, and impartial oppor-
tunity of vindicating his reputation.—How far your memorialist was
correct in the high estimate he had formed of the magnanimity and
impartial justice of the Federal Executive, is shown by the result.
Your Memorialist was not only dismissed from office on the secret
and insidious representations of his unknown accusers, but the injury
has been agrivated by witholding the causes of his removal.—The
dismissal of an officer from a place of high trust, and responsibility,
implies guilt of some misdemeanor, demanding a measure of such
harsness, and until the true cause shall have been assigned by the
proper, and responsible Department of the Government, the public
mind is left to conjecture, and speculate on the probable offence
which has been committed. Your Memorialist feeling a just, and

conscious pride in the belief, that he discharged with zeal and fidelity
every duty imposed upon him, by the high station which he lately
held, is unwilling to leave his reputation in an attitude so equivocal.
To relieve him from this embarrassment, and as an act of justice to
himself, he is reluctantly compelled to invoke the power of Congress to
pass a resolution, calling on the President of the United States
to disclose the real cause which produced the removal of Your
Memorialist from Office.
Your Memorialist has been informed by private letters which he has
received from Washington, that he was removed from Office on the
application of the Honorable J.R. Poinsett secretary of War, and Your
Memorialist has through the kindness of a personal friend, been fur-
nished with a Copy of a letter from this public functionary to the
President," making the request, for reasons therein assigned. Your
Memorialist deeply regrets to find this high officer of the Government,
one representing the pride and chivalry of his Country, assuming the
unworthy garb of the secret accuser. The blow has already been
given, the wound inflicted. But Your Memorialist is prepared as he
believes to shew that the reasons assigned for this extraordinary act,
though plausible and imposing, are fictitious, and unreal, and are
intended to conceal the personal malice, and political animosity long
cherished by the Hon” Secretary towards Your Memorialist, and by
which he was actuated on this occasion.—
In aid of the investigation of these facts, Your Memorialist prays,
that a resolution may be passed, calling on the Honorable J. R.
Poinsett to furnish a copy of his correspondence with your memorialist
and a copy of the correspondance of Your Memorialist, with all the
Officers of the United States Army who have served in Florida, so far
as the same may be found in the archives of the War Department.”
First in the catalogue of charges presented against your Memorialist,
by the Hon” Secretary, is that of an unwillingness to cooperate with
the commanding General in Florida. After speaking of its importance,
in his letter to the President, he says, –“such a result cannot be
expected, so long as the present Governor remains in power.” This is
a grave and serious charge, but its truth is put in issue; and is disproved
by the whole tenor of the correspondence of Your Memorialist, not
only with the Commanding Generals, but with the subordinate
Officers in Florida. The correspondence of your Memorialist " to
which he begs leave to refer Your Honorable Body, will show at all
times, and on all occasions, a disposition to cooperate, faithfully and

zealously, with the Officers of the U.S. Army, in all things, except the
plan, and polocy which has been generally pursued of abandoning
active operations, with the first appearance of Spring, and remaining
in Summer Qarters, until the month of November or December.
If a non acquiessence in this policy, be deemed a want of cooperation
on the part of your Memorialist, then is he guilty of the charge. He
could not in duty to God, and his country, remain an inactive spectator
of the horrid scenes of butchery which have been so often exhibited,
almost within the virge of the Capitol.—He could not turn a deaf ear
to the invocations of his fellow citizens, who called on him for pro-
tection He could not give his sanction to a policy which has pro-
tracted the war to its present length, exhausted the National Treasury,
and covered a large portion of the Territory he was appointed to
Govern, with ruin and desolation. But in no instance can it be shown,
that Your Memorialist ever did refuse to cooperate with any officer
of the Army in Florida, no matter what may have been his rank, when
the object proposed was intended to promote either the prosecution
of the War, or the protiction of the country.
The next matter of reproach contained in the letter of the Hon".
Secretary of War; is, that Your memorialist “failed to acquire the
respect of the Army of the South, while invested with the command
of it.” “And ever since that time, an unfriendly feeling had existed
between the Military and Civil Authorities, to the great inconvenience
of the Service” In nothing could the personal feeling of his accusor
have been more fully developed. That the whole Army of the United
States, and every portion of it, no matter where stationed was gener-
ally dissatisfied with the appointment of Your Memorialist to the
command in Florida, as it had a right to be, and as it would have
been with the appointment of any citizen to such a command, cannot
be doubted. This feeling was fully manifested in the public prints
of that day, and that many of the Officers were unwilling to cooperate
with, and were instrumental in having Your Memorialist superceeded
in command, he has as little doubt. Their professional pride was
wounded by seeing a citizen clothed with power, which they believed,
could not rightfully be confered on any other, than an Officer of the
Army.— However deficient Mr. Poinsett may be in Military knowl-
edge and capacity, he cannot be ignorant of the Esprit du Corps, of
the Army, and of the unwillingness of the Officers to see a Military
Command confered on a Citizen: And yet he has endeavoured to
reproach Your Memorialist for their opposition to his command over
them. Your Memorialist feels confident that he did not “fail to
acquire the respect of the army of the South,” so far as it ever came

under his command, by permitting it to slumber in Summer Quarters,
while the enemy desolated the country around it. But that all was
done which could have been accomplished by this inconsiderable
force, during the same time, and under the same circumstances. If
your Memorialist could in any degree be censurable for the state of
feeling mentioned by the Secretary of War, it would be for accepting
the command when confered on him. But the peculiar situation of
the Country, the danger and destruction to which it was exposed,
and the obligation on his part, to hazard all for its relief, he conceives
will answer every objection on this subject. At that period the Army
had retired to Summer Quarters, and the most of the officers of high
rank, were absent from the Territory, either in conducting the War
against the Creek Indians in Georgia and Alabama, or on furlough.
Most of the Military Posts had been abandoned, and the Indians
almost, without resistance, murdered the families, or plundered and
burnt the deserted houses, along the whole frontier for the distance of
more than 200 miles. Such was the condition of the Settlements
exposed to the invasion of the Seminoles; while on the other hand the
Creek Indians who evaded the pursuit and vigilence of the Army,
were passing in large, and small parties, from Alabama to the Pen-
insula of Florida, threatening desolation to the Country in their
march. For a more particular description of the danger, and suffering,
to which this country was then exposed, and the trials and difficulties
with which Your Memorialist had to contend, he respectfully refers
to his correspondence with Gov. Cass the then Secretary of War, a
part of which is herewith enclosed. This correspondence created the
germ of offence to those in power. It never died, but descended to the
succession, increased with time; and more recent correspondence,
until it matured into hatred confirmed dislike and finally produced the
removal of Your Memorialist from Office. The whole energies and
resources of the Government were at that time directed to the defence
and relief of the powerful States of Georgia and Alabama; while
Florida with her sparce and unarmed population, was left to struggle
for existance against the United forces of the Creeks and Seminoles.
Your Memorialist then urged the necessity of a summer Campaign,
as the only effectual measure for the protection of the country. At
this fearful crisis, when every portion of the Territory was threatened
with danger, and scarcely a man could be drawn from a settlement,
without exposing his family to butchery, -when the whole disposable
force of the United States in Florida, would not have formed an
effective Regiment; in mid-Summer, when no General Officer of the
Government desired it, the command in Florida was graciously
confered on Your Memorialist, with authority to make a Summer
Campaign. But he was especially informed that his authority would

be temporary, and that his command would cease, on the arrival of
Maj. Gen' Jesup, who was ordered to Florida.” The regular Troops
were stationed in the different Military Posts, from Tampa Bay to
St Augustine, and from their numbers and ill health, were scarcely
sufficient to defend their own positions, and furnish an escort for the
Supplies transported from the depôts to the posts of the interior.
Until the arrival of the Tennessee Brigade of Volunteers on the 15"
of September, Your Memorialist could with all his efforts, scarcely
assemble a sufficient force at any one of the numerous assailed, and
assailable points to hold the enemy in check. On the arrival of Maj.
Gen' Jesup in Florida on the 18" of September, Your Memorialist in
a personal interview, tendered to him the command of all the forces
in Florida, which he generously declined. It was however verbally
understood, and mutually agreed on between him and Your Memori-
alist, that he should retain the immediate command of all the forces
he brought with, and expected to follow him from Alabama, and that
he would sail from Appalachicola Bay to the mouth of the Withla-
coochee, or Tampa Bay, from whence he would enter the enemy's
country, while Your Memorialist with the Tennessee Brigade, then
about 1200 strong, a small Battalion of Florida Volunteers, and such
of the regular Troops as might arrive, or be drawn from the Military
Posts in East Florida, would pursue the Indians in the northern part
of their country. Although a friendly correspondence was main-
tained, no orders were given by Your Memorialist to Gen' Jesup, who
pursued his own plans, and acted on his own discretion.
Your Memorialist then just risen from a bed of illness, and scarcely
able to mount his horse without assistance, lost not a moment in
marching against the enemy, who after the shameful abandonment of
Fort Micanopy, advanced upon the settlements, and covered the
frontier with havock and dismay. He had relied on this post as a
depôt for his army; (see his letter to the Hon"Secretary Cass of the
7 of Sept 1836°) the situation of the country would not permit him
to halt, and the unexpected and precipitate abandonment of Mican-
opy, embarrassed every step of his operations. Other depots were to be
established, other post erected, and other recources created, while
hurrying to the relief of the exposed settlements. Your Memorialist
marched from Tallahassee on the 19" of September, the most un-
healthy season of the Year, and on the 4" day of November, an order
was issued by the direction of the President of the United States
superceeding him in command. The operations of your Memorialist
during that brief period, with his feeble forces, limited resources, and

surrounded with embarrassments, will be seen in his official report to
the War Department, and he does not shrink from a comparison of
them with what had before, or has since been done, within the same
time, by more numerous and better appointed Armies."
“The army of the South” as it is pompously termed, so far as it
ever came under the command of Your Memorialist in the field, con-
sisted only of one small Battalion, less than 300 strong; with most of
the Officers of this Battalion, though feeling the prejudice common to
the Regular Army against serving under the Command of a Militia
General, and strongly averse to a Summer Campaign, Your Memorial-
ist maintained the most harmonious intercourse, and he remembers
with pride and admiration, the zeal, alacrity and intripidity, with
which they generally cooperated with the volunteers of his command.
Even when placed upon half rations with the common soldier, in order
to continue the pursuit of the enemy, and give him battle, not a com-
plaint, not a murmer was heard.
The aligation of the Hon” Secretary that, “ever since that period,
(the command of your Memorialist over the Army of the South) an
unfriendly feeling has existed between the Military and Civil Author-
ities, to the great inconvenience of the Service”, is too equivocal, and
uncertain, to be either admitted, or denied. But if it is intended to
include Your Memorialist in the term “Civil Authorities,” and to
represent that unfriendly feelings, “have ever since existed” between
him and the Military, Your Memorialist denies the truth of the
assertion, and as a proof of the propriety of such denial, he refers to
his correspondence with Maj. Gen' Jesup, by whom Your Memorialist
was superceeded in command of the Army.—From that correspond-
ence it will appear that the best feelings, and the most harmonious
relations, both personal and official, existed between Your Memorialist,
and this distinguished Officer, during the whole period of his command
in Florida.
The correspondence between Gen" Taylor and your Memorialist
will disclose feelings little less cordial. It is true that Your Memorial-
ist has some times differed with him essentially in his views of the
measures necessary to defend the frontier, as well as for the successful
prosecution of the War. But Your Memorialist has ever attributed
to this General the possession, not only of high personal worth, but
of great zeal and energy in the performance of his duty.
That Your Memorialist has earnestly remonstrated with the Secre-
tary of War, against the conduct of certain officers, serving in Florida,
in withholding supplies from the Florida Troops, called into service

by Your Memorialist under the authority of the War Department,
at a time when the frontier was exposed to the utmost peril, he readily
admits. Your Memorialist begs leave respectfully to refer Your
Honorable Body to his correspondence on this subject, both with the
Secretary of War, and his subordinate officers, and he appeals with
confidence to your judgement, and your impartial justice to decide,
whether it would not have been more compatible with the high charac-
ter of the minister of War, to have enforced obedience to his own
orders, and to have given that protection to the bleeding frontier of
Florida, which Your Memorialist sought to obtain; than to make his
respectful application to him for this purpose; the foundation of an
insidious and unjust accusations against Your Memorialist.
Your Memorialist again repeats his earnest request, that your
Honorable Body will carefully examine this correspondence and de-
cide whether the Hon"Secretary of War should not be held responsible
to his country for the blood which has been shed through the weakness
and imbicility of his administration of the War Department. After
speaking of the unfriendly feeling which he alledges to have existed
between the Military, and civil authorities, the Secretary of War
adds,--"this feeling constantly manifested by the Governor, has
lately been so openly avowed as to produce an effect on all connected
with the Regular Army, which if not counteracted may be attended
with unpleasant and disasterous consequences.” Your Memorialist
has been greatly at a loss to conjecture what it is to which the Hon”
Secretary alludes, and believes that he has chosen to be mysterious,
in order to give to his accusation the more imposing effect, as Your
Memorialist is not conscious of having openly or otherwise avowed a
“feeling” calculated to produce the fearful results anticipated by his
accuser. The Allusion may be to a “feeling” sometimes expressed
by Your Memorialist towards the present incumbent of the War
Department, and to which he will have occasion hereafter to advert.
A shrug, and a grimace, often intimates more than the courtier would
hazard his reputation to express, and like the fabled mountain, when
the hon” Secretary shall have been delivered of his mysterious
conception, sympathy for his sufferings will be forgotten in the
astonishment at his wonderful progeny.
The accuser of your Memorialist in his letter to the president,
speaks of the unfriendly feeling existing between the Regular Troops
and the Militia, and although the charge is not directly made, it may
be infered that this forms a part of the grounds of complaint against
Your Memorialist. This if intended, is not less fair, and equitable
than all the rest of the positions taken by the Secretary of War. The
only difficulty which has taken place in Florida, between the Regular

Troops, and the Militia, so far as your Memorialist is advised, occurred
at Tampa Bay, with the Troops of Missouri and Alabama. Troops
which your Memorialist never saw, or had the least intercourse with,
or controll over. That your Memorialist has endeavoured to dis-
courage those feelings among the Florida Militia and Volunteers is
fully shown by his correspondence with Col. Robt. Brown, published
in the pamphlet herewith enclosed,” and to which Your Memorialist
begs leave to refer.
The Honbi Secretary of War proceeding with his accusations against
your Memorialist says.—“Besides Gov. Call dissatisfied with the
rejection of his offer to enlist a large body of Militia for the service
in Florida, and of the urgent recommendations of his friends to have
the whole command and conduct of the War entrusted to him, has
publickly declared his intention to propose to the Legislature of
Florida to furnish the necessary funds to provide for an Army to act
under the Authority of the Territory” Your Memorialist denies
that his friends ever did with his knowledge or consent, reccommend
that he should “have the whole command and conduct of the War
entrusted to him”, and if such a reccommendation was ever given,
and rejected, without his knowledge, he being ignorant of the fact,
it could have given him no dissatisfaction.—Your Memorialist denies
that he ever desired the command of any portion of the United States
Troops stationed in Florida. He sought to obtain a seperate district
of the enemy's country, including that which had been conquered by
the enemy, where with the pariotic Volunteers of Georgia Alabama,
& Florida, who had offered their services he might operate without
commanding, or being command by the Regular Officers. After the
late truce had been repeatedly violated by the Seminoles, and when
the treachery of this perfidious ruse had been fully developed by the
most shocking acts of barbarity, in the destruction of whole families
without discrimination of age or sex, and while the Army appear still
to confide in the good faith, and hold amicable relations with the
enemy; Your Memorialist believing that the President of the United
States was unacquainted with the true condition of this hapless
Territory, with the hope of awakening to action the dormant energies
of the War Department, and of procuring for the people of Florida
the protection they have a right to claim, on the 28" day of July
last addressed a letter to the President of the United States," urging
in strong and energetic terms the necessity of prosecuting the war
with vigor, “through every change and vicissitude of Season, without

halt, truce, or parley, until the war should be brought to a successful
termination.” Your Memorialist believed the adoption of this course
was required no less for the safety of the people of Florida, than for
the preservation of the National honor. A truce had been made, and
violated under the most agrevating circumstances. The national
dignity had been insulted, our arms had been put at defiance, our
citizens murdered, our soldiers surprised and massacred. Your
Memorialist could not believe that the head of this powerful Nation,
the successor, the immediate successor of Gen. Jackson, could have
hesitated in addopting the most prompt measures to visit with signal
punishment, this savage and perfidious people, and with a part of
the force to be employed Your memorialist offered at Mid-Summer
to take the field, and had he been permitted, or could he have pro-
cured supplies he would have marched at the head of 5,000 of the
best Troops of the adjoining States, and of this Territory. With a
hope of procuring a more immediate attention to his suggestions,
Your Memorialist sent a deputation from among the most intelligent
and respectable gentlemen of Florida to wait on the President to
deliver the letter above mentioned, and entreat him to action. A
copy of that letter," with a copy of the report of this deputation com-
municating the result of the mission is herewith enclosed,” and to
which your Memorialist begs leave to refer Your Honorable Body.
But Your memorialist was no less disappointed in the results of the
mission, than he was in the effect which the disasterous intelligence
from Florida produced on the President and Secretary of War. In-
stead of finding them at the Capitol planing a campaign, and provid-
ing for a prompt and energetic movement to punish the treachery
and cruelty of the savages, the deputation was compelled to pursue
them thrugh the State of New York, catching a hasty interview at
White Hall, and at Plattsburge, and finding them much more disposed
to listen to the grateful sound of popular applause, than to the suf-
ferings and distress of this unhappy Territory. A campaign against
political opponents in New York, was deemed a matter of far greater
moment than one against the treacherous Seminoles in Florida.—
With regard to the avowal of the intention of Your Memorialist to
apply to the Legislature of Florida to furnish the necessary funds to
provide for an Army to act under the Authority of the Territory.
This is true. It was the intention of Your Memorialist to have made
such an application. But was it for this Your Memorialist was
superceeded as the Governor of this Territory. Your Memorialist
believes he may venture to say it was not. The Hon” Secretary

had himself given sanction to the raising of a force to act under the
Authority of the Territory. He had ordered General Taylor to
cause to be supplied a military force not to exceed 300 men, to be
subject alone to the orders of Your Memorialist.” And owing to the
failure of one of his subordinate Officers to furnish the supplies, though
repeatedly ordered to do so by the General, as your Memorialist has
been informed, Your Memorialist was compelled to borrow near
$50,000 to sustain his troops, which sum has never yet been refunded
by the Government. The Troops which your memorialist proposed
to raise, under the power of the Legislature, would have acted under
the same Authority as those raised by the sanction of the Secretary
of War. But when did the Hon” Secretary first learn the intention
of your Memorialist to raise a force to act under the authority of the
Territory? In a special Message to the Legislative Council dated
on the 7" February 1839, a copy of which is herewith enclosed,"
your Memorialist reccommended this measure, and two different
acts were passed during that session confering on the Gov. of Florida
the power of raising men “to act under the authority of the Territory,”
with the further power of issuing the Bonds of the Territory to raise
money to the amount of $600000 for the support of these Troops,
and nothing but the inability of Your memorialist to negotiate the
bonds for a sufficient amount, (the contingency not having arisen,
which would justify the issue) prevented him from raising a large
force to operate against the enemy during the summer Months, while
the Army of the South as it is called, reposed in Summer Quarters.
A copy of the special Message refered to was sent both to the Presi-
dent of the United States and to the Secretary of War. Neither could
have been ignorant of the intention of your Memorialist, to raise
money and support Troops, “to act under the authority of the Terri-
tory,” and yet Your Memorialist was without the least solicitation
on his part, after this, reappointed Gov. of Florida. With what
propriety then could the Hon” Secretary of War demand the removal
of your memorialist from Office, for the avowal of his intention to
do that which he had done a year before, without censure or reproof
from the Government? But if it were possible that the facts, and
circumstances mentioned by your Memorialist could have escaped
the notice and attention of the President & Secretary of War; they
were both, by his letter to the President dated 28* July, 1839, informed
that your Memorialist had raised men, and of his intention to raise a
still larger force. In that letter your Memorialist observed, “I have
two companies in the pay and subsisted by the Territory, and I shall

employ as many more as the limited resources of Florida can support,
until the enemy shall have been driven beyond the reach of annoyance
to the settlements.”
This letter was delivered in the Month of August, and refered to
the Hon"Secretary of War. He was then fully apprised of the inten-
tion to raise “as many troops to serve under the Authority of the
Territory “as the limited resources of Florida could support.” If
this was cause of complaint, if it constituted an offence for which your
Memorialist should have been removed, if it threatened the fearful
consequences anticipated by the Hon” Secretary, why did he not
immediately apply for the removal of your Memorialist. Why was
this necessary measure delayed until the middle of December? The
cause is plain. This is but the plausible pretext, the fictitious reason
given to hide one far less justifyable as your Memorialist will here-
after show. The Troops mentioned in the letter of your Memorialist
to the President of the United States were actively employed in defence
of the frontier. Their number was increased to 250, and with this
force your Memorialist marched in the middle of Sep', and during a
continued and persevering scout of 30 days, dislodged the enemy
whereever found in Middle Florida. Two large settlements were
broken up each within ten or fifteen miles of a Military Post of the
United States, where the Indians in considerable numbers, with their
wives and children had been permitted to build houses and cultivate
crops without interruption, and from whence they had annoyed the
settlements, and destroyed the frontier inhabitants, as well as the
expressmen and military escorts of the Government. On this expedi-
tion your Memorialist subsisted his troops at the charge of the Terri-
tory, but on one occasion being unable to reach his supplies, he arrived
with his Battalion after night at one of the Military Posts of the
Government, his horses and men greatly fatigued with their march
and destitute of forage. As a temporary relief, Your Memorialist
sought to borrow a small supply from the abundant stores of the
Government, under a pledge to return the same quantity on the
following day at noon; but even this trifling accomodation was denied.
Your memorialist would do injustice to many esteemed friends and
meritorious Officers of the Army, if he were to omit a statement of
the fact, that he believes the inhospitality which he experienced at
the Post above mentioned, was owing entirely to the orders of the
commanding Officer of the District, whose conduct on a former occa-
sion in withholding supplies from the Florida Troops, had been re-
ported to the Secretary of War without producing the desired effect.
Thus increasing the bad feelings of which he complains in his letter
to the president. Your memorialist has other convincing proofs
that his removal from office, was not occasioned by the avowal of

his intention to endeavour to raise troops to act under the authority
of the Territory. Had it have been so his successor must have come
into Office under an implied pledge to adopt a different course of
Policy. So far from this he has not only retained the Troops of the
Territory which he found in service, but he has employed others,
signed and negociated the Bonds of the Territory to a large amount
to raise money for their support. These troops are now acting under
the orders of the present executive, and entirely independent of the
Authority of the U.S. Officers—If it were culpable in Your Memorialist
to maintain a military force at the charge of the Territory, and
independent of the authority of the commanding General, the same
act and the same policy cannot be more justifyable in his successor.
If such a measure under the administration of your Memorialist,
would have brought the War Department “into direct collision with
the Civil Authorities of the Territory, and involve the Government in
great immediate expense, as well as lay the foundation of interminable
claims upon the Treasury,” it must produce the same result under
the administration of his successor. Your Memorialist believing that
he has sufficiently exposed the weakness, the falicy, and fiction of
the reasons assigned for the removal of your memorialist from office,
will now proceed to show, what he verily believes were the true motives
by which this functionary of the Government was actuated. Your
Memorialist has been informed and believes that on the 16" day of
Nov last John P. Duval late secretary of this Territory," who was at
length dismissed from Office, for neglect of duty, and disobedience
of the repeated and positive orders of the Government, prefered
charges against your Memorialist in a letter addressed to the Hon”
J. R. Poinsett,” the only charge of which your Memorialist has heard
is that of holding the Hon” J. R. Poinsett in great contempt, arrising
from the weakness and imbicility of this officer in the prosecution
of the Florida war. Your Memorialist prays that a resolution may
be passed, calling on the Hon"J. R. Poinsett to furnish a copy of that
letter, and such others as he may have rec" from the said J. P. Duval
making charges against Your Memorialist, and when produced that
your Hon” Body will compare the date of the charges prefered against
your Memorialist, with the date of the letter of the Hon"Secretary
to the President of the United States applying for the removal of
Your memorialist from Office.—
Your Memorialist has recently heard and believes that there was a
secret conspiracy formed against him by a faction in this Territory
who professed to be the exclusive friends of the President of the
United States, and that a petition was circulated among them and

signed, appealing to the President to sustain his party in Florida,
telling him that they (the petitioners) despaired of what they were
pleased to descriminate the democracy of this Territory, without
a change of administration, and praying for the removal of Your
Memorialist from Office, and the appointment of the Honb" R. R.
Reid as his successor.” Your Memorialist prays that a resolution
may be passed calling on the Honb' Secretary of State to produce a
Copy of that, and all other memorials on the subject, with the names
of each subscriber. Your Memorialist believes that the production
of the documents mentioned in the two last resolutions will fully
establish a concert of action between the Department of War and
State, and a secret combination between them and a faction in this
Territory composed of all political parties, federal and Territorial,
for the removal of Your Memorialist from Office—
If it be an offence requiring such a penalty, to hold the plans and
policy pursued by M Poinsett in prosecuting the Florida War, in
contempt, a policy which has desolated the fairest portion of this
Territory, bankrupt the National Treasury, and covered our people
with mourning and sorrow, Your Memorialist pleads guilty of the
charge, and prays that his dismissal may be placed on that footing.
If the removal from Office of Your Memorialist was necessary to
sustain the political party of the President in this Territory, let this
also be assigned as a reason. But truth, justice, and every principle
of honorable action, revolts at the attempt to fabricate fictitious and
unfounded reasons for this harsh and extraordinary measure. Your
Memorialist complains not of his removal from Office, but of the
manner, the insulting and contemptuous manner in which it was
done. He complains, and justly complains of the dishonorable attempt
to assign unreal and fictitious reasons for the act. Your Memorialist
feels a just pride in the reflection that while in Office his whole facul-
ties and best energies were ever employed to promote the happiness,
the safety and prosperity of the people of Florida. For them he often
periled life and fortune, and that he considered the Office of Gov-
ernor of this Territory as valueless, when weighed in the scale with
the safety and protection of those who looked to him for defence
against the savage enemy; he begs leave to refer Your Honorable
Body to the following extract from his instructions to the deputation
sent by him to wait on the president of the United States and urge a
more prompt and vigorous prosecution of the War.

Militia have been rendered useless, by withholding from them, on
my requisition the necessary supply of arms, amunition and sub-
sistance. On this subject I beg leave to refer you to my correspondence
with Col Davenport, a copy of which in manuscript is herewith
enclosed. I deem it indespensibly necessary to the security of the
frontier, that the Governor of this Territory, should not only have
the power of ordering out the Militia in cases of emergency, but that
he should have the means of furnishing them with supplies. It is not
necessary that I should be Governor, but it is necessary that the
Governor, be he who he may, should have that power. And I have
to request Gentlemen, that you will urge this upon the President
of the United States, and as citizens of this Territory, deeply inter-
ested in its safety and prosperity, insist that this power shall be
confered. If the President should be unwilling to entrust me with
the exercise of this power, he owes it to himself, and to the people of
Florida to dismiss me from Office, and appoint one in whom he has
more confidence.—I hope Gentlemen you will urge this upon him
with all Your zeal and energy. That which may be found most con-
ducive to the safety and prosperity of the people of Florida, will be
most acceptable to me”
The propriety of the opinion above expressed cannot be doubted
by any rational mind. The absurdity of waiting to consult the
Commanding General at the distance of two or three hundred miles,
and of obtaining his permission to raise and support troops to drive
back the marauding bands of the Indians, while burning and plunder-
ing almost within sight of the Capitol is too glaring even for comment,
and yet this is the system which the Hon” Secretary has endeavoured
to enforce during his whole administration; that he is justly account-
able, for all the blood which has been shed, and the lives which have
been lost under this miserable policy, no one can doubt.
Such were the views and feelings of your memorialist, and he
rejoices that the last moment of his official existence was devoted
to the defence of his country. The deputation sent by your memorial-
ist to wait on the President, acted in accordance with the above
instructions, and what was the reply of this high functionary, is shown
by the following extract of a letter received from three of the
members of that deputation.
“The committee acted in obedience to your instructions, and
stated to the president emphatically, that if he had not entire con-
fidence in you to remove you from Office, and appoint some one in
whom he could confide: to which the president replied, That Gov
Call was a high-minded honorable and talented Gentleman in whom
he had every confidence.”

But these considerations were forgotten when the removal of
your Memorialist was demanded by a member of his cabinet. That
your Memorialist has evinced strong feelings in his correspondence
with the Secretary of War, he does not deny. But those feelings
were produced by a knowledge of the danger and suffering to which
the people of Florida were exposed, and the indifference and neglect,
with which those sufferings have been regarded by the head of the
War Department. Under his administration hundreds of square
miles which were once inhabited by a happy and prosperous people,
are now restored to their original wildness, and solitude, and the
whole frontier presents one wide spread scene of desolation and ruin.
Millions of public Treasures have been expended, and hundreds and
thousands, of human lives have been sacrificed, and after a conflict
of more than four years continuance, the arms of this powerful
Nation, are now employed in defensive warfare against the victorious
Seminoles.
The Army has retired from the enemy's country, leaving him in
undisturbed possession of all the Territory he possesed at the com-
mencement of hostilies, and is now engaged in the attempt to draw
the enemy from that which he has conquered. Under this system
what reasonable hope can be entertained, that any one now living
will see the close of this unhappy conflict. So long as the present
policy is pursued, so long will the war continue, until the last house,
and the last inhabitant of Florida shall have fallen by the hands of
the Savages. For more than three years has your Memorialist argued,
remonstrated, and entreated against this policy, but all his anxious
efforts have had a tendency only to excite the displeasure and dis-
approbation of the Government. It is always a thankless and
sometimes a perilous responsibility to remind men in power of the
weakness and inefficiency of their measures; but your Memorialist
could not regard those considerations, when his duty required him
to speak in plain and comprehensive language. He could not flatter
and applaud the man under whose administration of the War De-
partment he had seen the brightest hopes of this Territory blighted,
and hundreds of its people reduced from abundance to want, and
almost to famine.
Your Memorialist cannot forbear a comparison of the condition
of this Territory at the commencement of hostilities, with its situation
at the present moment. The war found the Seminoles located within
their boundary on the Peninsula. The public lands had become a
source of revinue to the Government. The tide of emigration was
fast flowing in. The settlements of the white man were advancing
in close proximity to the Indian boundary, and the dawn of prosperity,
which promised a bright day of success to the emigrant, every where

appeared. This state of peace and happiness, was disturbed by the
first policy of the Government to remove the Indians from the land
of their nativity, under the provisions of a treaty previously made.
The people of this Territory were no parties to this compact, they
were not consulted on the occasion, they had no agency in the nego-
ciation or the execution of the Treaty. Their situation was peculiar.
They were the dependants of the National Government; without
political influence or a voice in the National Councils. The Seminoles
resisted the power of the Government; and our once happy and
prosperous country became the theatre of a bloody and long protracted
struggle. The tide of war rolled back upon us. House after house
has fallen, family after family has been murdered, the frontier has
receeded near one hundred miles, and the unconquered savages, pass
in triumph over the deserted fields, and dreary ruins of the Christian
settlements. We owe to the Government of the United States alle-
gience, and in return she owes us protection. Protection of our lives,
protection in the enjoyment of our property, but above all, in the
undisturbed possession, and enjoyment of the lands we have purchased
from, and paid her for. How far this reciprocal obligation has been
performed on her part, has been proclaimed in the dying groans, and
written in the blood of hundreds of helpless women and lisping babes,
who have perished by the knife of the savage, or been consumed in
the flames of their own dwellings. The National treasury has indeed
been most liberally appropriated by Congress; but if we may judge
of the future from the past and the present, it has been expended
under a system which can never be successful, and if continued will
ultimately deliver this Territory to the undisturbed possession of the
savages, and wild beasts of the forest.
That the vast resources and power of the United States are com-
petant to the conquest of this band of savages, no one can doubt.
Nor is her political and moral obligation to do so less certain. The
last hope of subduing the Indians by kindness, and closing the war
by conciliatory measures, must have expired even in the minds of
those who have been so often duped by their treachery and cunning.
The repeated violations of the late truce, both in the murder of our
citizens, and the surprise and massacre of the soldiers, must have
convinced the most credulous, that no reliance whatever can be placed
in their plighted faith, and that there is no other alternative than
that of subduing the Indians, or of leaving the inhabitants of Florida
to be exterminated by them. Your Memorialist cannot believe that,
the national Legislature will hesitate in the choice of the positions
to be taken, and that when it shall understand the true situation
of this Territory, that it will adopt the necessary measures for its
relief.

But your Memorialist most earnestly believes, that something more
is necessary to be done by Congress than the mere appropriation of
money to conduct the war. He is favourably impressed with this
belief, not only from his knowledge and observation of the manner in
which the war has been conducted, and the results with which it has
been attended, but from the notice taken of the subject by the
President in his last annual message. The petty corporations of this
Territory have claimed more paternal concern from the Federal
Executive, than the Seminole War, which is depopulating the country,
consuming the substance of our people, and draining the last artery
of the National Treasury. Your Honbi Body may rest assured, that
if this fatal, and destructive war is not arrested in its progress, no
concern need be felt for our corporations, for they will most assuredly
be involved in the general ruin, and must fall with those by whom they
have been created, and sustained. The President dismisses the
subject of the war in a short paragraph, by reccommending the Report
of the Honbi Secretary.” And what is that report? What is the
plan proposed to end this harrassing conflict, and restore this Territory
to peace and tranquility. He says that “orders have been given to
change for the present the theatre of operations.” The frequent
murders in Middle and West Florida, show that there are still small
bands of Indians lurking there, and it is the determination of the
Department in the first place to draw them from that part of the
Territory, and free the settlements from further molestation.” Thus
proving what Your Memorialist has before stated, that the Army has
retired from the enemy's country, and is engaged in defensive meas-
ures, after a war of four Years continuance. And why has it become
necessary to abandon offensive for defensive War? Why has it
become necessary to send the Army to operate in Middle and West
Florida? From the commencement of hostilities, until a short time
before Maj. General Jesup retired from Command Your Memorialist
defended Middle and West Florida with the Territorial Militia and
Volunteers. Not a Regular soldier was employed in this service until
May 1838 except for a very short time in 1836 and although great
embarrassment was sometimes experienced from the want of sub-
sistance, forage, and Pay, and Your Memorialist was on more than
one occasion compelled to pledge his private fortune, and borrow
money to pay the troops, this frontier was not only defended, but was
comparatively safe. It is a fact which cannot be denied, that more
blood has been shed in Middle Florida, and more property has been
destroyed, in the last 13 months, while it has been defended by a
large Regular Force, than there had been previously, during the

whole period of the War. Had the Honbi Secretary adopted the plan
reccommended by Your Memorialist, in his letter to that functionary
dated the 4” of Oct. 1838,” middle and west Florida would have
been saved from the danger and suffering to which it has since been
exposed, and the National Army, might have continued its offensive
operations against the enemy. Your Memorialist asked to be per-
mitted to raise only 400 mounted men, to perform this important
service, the expense of which would scarcely have amounted one
tithe of what has been expended. It is a principle of Warfare, known
to the whole civilized world, and well established since the days of
Hannibal, that the most certain and efficient mode of defence against
an invading enemy, is to carry the war into his own country, and
throw him on the defensive. This universal principle is as applicable
to savage as it is to civilized warfare, for though the Seminoles have
no treasures to lose, no temples to defend, their house hold Gods,
are their wives and children, and their fierce warriors will not leave
those exposed to an invading army, to strike at the distant frontier
settlements. Your Memorialist, is well convinced from four years
observation and experience, that no system of defensive warfare can
give successful protection to our settlements against the inroads of
the enemy, and that if the whole Army of the United States with all
its gallantry formed one entire cordon of Posts on our borders, the
skulking savage would still pass the chain, of defence at night and
break upon the slumber of the settler. This opinion is based on the
well known and undeniable fact that during the last summer, the
trails of the enemy, often in considerable numbers, were found passing
within less than one mile of Military Posts garrisoned by a company
of Regular Soldiers. The frontier should indeed be protected, but
the only certain and permanent defence is to be found in an energetic,
and continuous prosecution of the War in the enimy's own country.
Keep him employed at home, and he will find but little time to annoy
the settlements, and if such annoyance should be offered, instead of
with drawing the Army, and placing it as a guard for the frontier
let the settlements be defended as they were by the Volunteers and
Militia during the first two years of the War, and let the Army con-
tinue to hunt the enemy in the Peninsula. No one will pretend that
the principal force of the enemy is to be sought in Middle and West
Florida, or that he could not be driven out by the volunteers and
Militia.
The Secretary of War describes them as “Small bands of Indians
still lurking there”. Why did he not permit a volunteer or Militia
force to be employed to drive them out. On the night of the 13 May

last three families were attacked on the Appalachicola River and 13
persons destroyed. Since that time numerous other attacks have been
made, and murders committed, and not one moment of safety, and
tranquility has been experienced in the sparce settlements in that
quarter. Your Memorialist then offered to expel the enemy with the
local Troops, and asked for supplies for that purpose, which was re-
fused, (see his correspondence with Col Deavenport enclosed to the
President and Secretary of War.) What apology then can be offered
for the Sect of War in with drawing the Army from the enemy's
country, and suspending offensive operations, to hunt the “small bands
of the Indians lurking in West and Middle Florida. Are not the re-
sources of this nation sufficient to afford a guard for the frontier while,
the Army prosecutes the war against the enemy to a final termina-
tion?– And if the army, as it is now employed should succeed (of
which there is but little hope) in driving out these “small bands of
Indians”, when it advances again to seek the enemy in his strong hold
on the Peninsula, what is to prevent those “small bands” and others
from returning, to visit in blood and spoil of the frontier settler. For
four Years has this struggle continued with unremitted horrors, for
four years has the Frontier been gradually receeding before the advance
of the enemy. It still continues to receed, and the fall of every house
and the destruction of every family adds new Territory to the domin-
ion of the savages. If the people of this ill-fated Territory are to be
saved from impending dangers & apparent ruin. If this disasterous
and harrassing conflict, is ever to be closed, except by the expulsion
of the white-man from Florida, the war must be conducted on a
different plan and with increased energy. For the views long enter-
tained by your Memorialist, on this subject, he again respectfully
invites the attention of Your Honb". Body to his letter addressed to
the President of the United States on the 28" of July last.
If Your Memorialist in his attempt to seek redress for an injury
personal to himself, should succeed in drawing the attention of
Congress, to the abuses of Power, the mal-administration of the War
Department, and the suffering and relief of Florida, he will regard
his removal from office as one of the happyest events of his life. With
the hope of producing this desirable result, Your Memorialist as a
citizen of this Territory, prays that a special committee be appointed
to enquire into the manner in which the war has been conducted by the
present incumbent of the War Department. What time the campaign
has commenced, and what time it has closed in each and every year.
What proportion of the time has been spent in negociations with
the enemy, and what are the plans of the Secretary, for closing the
war. Your Memorialist further prays that Congress will adopt the
necessary measures to enforce a vigerous, and energetic prosecution

measures proper to be adopted for the further prosecution of the
Savage War in which we are involved.
Since you have been in session, a number of our people, among them
a woman and her children have been literally butchered by the
Indians, many of whom occupy the swamps and other fastnesses of
Western Florida, from the Apalachicola, and even beyond it, to the
Suwannee; while, in East Florida, the recent murder of the mail
carriers, within a few miles of St. Augustine, prove how unavailing
has been every effort to restrain the enemy in that quarter. Indeed,
it would seem, that these Wild Beasts, for so they deserve to be con-
sidered; their cruelties and thirst for blood, place them beyond the
pale of humanity—these wild beasts, are becoming more and more
audacious, their deeds of horror are rather accumulating than diminish-
ing; they venture to assail houses, and appear in our public roads in
the open day; they press beyond military posts to perpetrate their
murderous purposes, and start up like evil spirits, when least expected
to appear, to destroy the brave, virtuous and innocent. The number
of Seminole Indians in the country, can only be conjectured, but it is
believed, to be greater than is generally supposed. There are probably
many Creeks and some Cherokees, and even some of Seminoles,
deported to the West, it is said, have returned; but be the number
great or small, every thicket and deep forest is liable to be occupied
by them; they elude pursuit—to drive them thoroughly from one part
of the country to another, is impracticable, and it is ascertained that
during the past year, they have planted and make crops, within a few
miles of military stations. Our situation is verging upon desperation—
men sleep with arms under their pillows—a sense of insecurity ac-
companies the traveller in his journey on the highway—every neigh-
borhood has its tale of blood and those who are in authority look
around with pain and distress, because they are powerless to afford
an adequate remedy, for the evils thronging around them in every
direction.
This is no exaggerated picture, of our present condition. Romance
lags far behind the sad realities, we daily witness, and it becomes our
duty to consider, what may be done for the relief of the country!
To such measures as shall be adopted, by the Federal Government,
for “the pacification of Florida,” I am quite sure we will lend a hearty
concurrence and support. But, being upon the spot—with the
disastrous circumstances near to the view—any plan of operations
recommended by the authorities of Florida, will doubtless meet at
Washington, an attentive consideration.
I am persuaded that if it were in the power of the government to
fill the country with an overwhelming force—and to hunt, and pursue
the Indians in every direction; vexed, tired and harrassed, they would

soon yield to such terms as might be imposed upon them; but as it is
not probable, that under existing circumstances, a large army will
be thrown into the Territory—some other course, more practicable
in its character, must be devised. I am inclined to think then, that
three Brigades, acting with energy, and under that discipline which
befits the peculiar service, to which they would be called—might be
competent to the attainment of the object we all have so anxiously
at heart.
Two of these brigades would be of Volunteers and the other of
Regulars, all enlisted during the War, with the pay of Cavalry or
Dragoons, and a bounty of land: 320 acres to each private, and to
the officers in proportion; to be bestowed upon the final establishment
of peace. The regiments composing the brigades, should each consist
of from, ten to twelve companies, of fifty men each, formed accord-
ing to the organization of the Regular Army of the United States.
The volunteers could not be better commanded, than by the Briga-
diers of the Territory, who have received their commissions from the
President, and who have both distinguished themselves during the
present disastrous conflict. If there were no other events, in which
they have been prominent, the gallant, and successful enterprise
of the Block House, on the Withlacoochee, and the capture of King
Philip and the Euchee Chief, will secure to these Floridians, a bright
page in the History of this devoted Land. These officers would
of course be under the command of the General, commanding the
U. States Brigade. One third, perhaps one fourth, of the whole
number of men, should be of Cavalry, and the rest Infantry; for the
latter are better calculated for Indian fighting. The Indians act
on foot, and on foot, they should be followed. Their apparrel is
light, and so should be that of their pursuers—they are able to
encounter fatigue, hardship and hunger, and those who oppose them
should be trained to endure the same difficultier and privations.
With these troops—always in action—ever in search of the foe,
pressing him sorely wherever he may be found, and following him
through the Swamps and Hammocks of the country, the war could
not be of long continuance—the more especially, should both Regulars
and Volunteers, cultivate a good understanding with each other, and
open their hearts to the emotions of a generous rivalry, fervent
patriotism, and a valorous determination to win that Glory, which
must belong to those, who shall rescue Florida, from her grievous
and bitter woes.
It is with masses of men, as with individuals—let the superiority
of mental and physical power be what it may—nothing can be accom-
plished without a spirit—let it be called enthusiasm, if you will, which

brings every energy into play, and vigorously bends it to the
accomplishment of the desired purpose.
Supposing the plan proposed to be adopted: the companies at
present in the Territorial service, would be merged in the army of
volunteers, and the Territory saved from the expenditure, to which
it is now subject; an expenditure called for by the necessity of the
case, and for the reimbursement of which, the Territory must look
to the General Government.
The militia laws should be enforced—the people well armed, and
every company divided into detachments, each ready to proceed
at a moments warning, against the Indians should they appear in its
vicinity. For these services whenever called for, and performed,
the militia should be entitled to pay, upon due proof of the exigency,
and of the service performed.
With our people armed, acting in concert, and always prepared
for the strife, it is believed that many of the benefits expected from
“the Armed occupation Bill” now before Congress, would be experi-
enced, and the martial tone, and efficacy demanded by the crisis,
would belong to the character of our citizens.
No occasion has yet occurred for testing, the usefulness of the
Dogs bro’t from Cuba. It is still believed, however, that they may
be used with effect; and why should they not be used? If robbers
and assassins assail us, may we not defend our property and our lives
even with Bloodhounds? Shall we look upon our ruined dwellings—
upon the murdered and mangled bodies of men, women and children,
and then meekly say, “the poor Indians have done this—we must be
merciful and humane to them—we will not set our dogs upon them—
oh! no, that would be more horrible than these butcheries.” Those
who are safe from Indian alarms in distant cities and peaceful lands,
may indulge in gentle strains of humanity and brotherly love—were
they dwellers in the log cabins of Florida, they would attune their
notes to harsher measures. Let these men, in whose hearts there is
such a gush of the “milk of human kindness,” consider attentively,
a scene recently exhibited, upon the Apalachicola. Mr. Harlans
dwelling was burned, and his family murdered in the afternoon of
the 29th of January last. Mr. H. was absent, and an eye witness,
gives the following account of the return of the unhappy man, with
an armed party, on the day after the occurrence.
“On arriving at the spot, we found every house reduced to ashes,
and at the kitchen door the bones of a human being nearly burnt up;
after examining all around, we saw the track of moccasins making
ingress and egress the same course. On the trail not far off, we saw
articles of clothing, potatoes and papers dropped—about twenty-one
persons armed, now arrived from Iola, amongst them Mr. Harlan,

who in a wretched state of feelings, proceeded to examine the burnt
bones, which he believed to be those of his wife and a son, whose knife
he found amongst them. One of the company in searching behind
the garden about 100 yards off—called out ‘Come here Harlan, here
is your Wife, joy immediately sprang to my bosom, and I ran to see
the dead come to life, where there was a general rush—but lo! I found
Mrs. H. lying prostrate on the ground, behind some pine logs, with
her throat cut, a ball shot through her arm, one in her back, and a
fatal shot in the head, which must have been very near, as the patch
of the ball was sticking to her head. Her youngest son, say 8 years
old, lay near her side, with his skull fractured, by a pine stick which
lay near him. He exhibited signs of life, and I had him carried to a
shelter, water given him, and his feet, which were cold, put in warm
water, and faint hopes are now entertained of his recovery. Had you
witnessed the heart rending sight of Mr. H. embracing his little son,
and calling him by his nickname ‘Buddy! Buddy! Buddy!' with the
solemn sound of parental affection, sunk to the lowest ebb of dejection,
and then running to the corpse of his wife, with his arms around her
crying out ‘My Wife! My dear Wife! Oh, my dear Wife!” I know
your feelings would have given way as mine did; I had always felt
a sympathy for these merciless savages, but my heart now assumed
a stern fortitude, foreign to its nature, and I felt like not leaving an
Indian foot to make a track in the ashes of the desolation they have
made.”
Who can read this extract from the letter of a highly respectable
gentleman, without anguish? Who can witness such atrocities
without admitting it to be lawful to use blood hounds against such
hell hounds?
A citizen, remarkable for his piety, integrity and intelligence, lately
exclaimed in my presence, “I would use devils, if I could, against such
an enemy,” and I am compelled to yield assent to the sentiment.
The introduction of these animals is entirely, it is believed, a Terri-
torial measure. It is creditable to the officer with whom it originated,
and whose ample justification is the stern necessity which required it.
In the straight to which we are driven, the severest means are the
best means, and whatever tends to the speedy termination of our
protracted difficulties, will tend also to the preservation of human life,
and to the advancement of the cause of humanity.
It is matter of regret to me, that before communicating these views
to you, I have not had an opportunity of personally conferring with
the officer commanding the U.S. troops in Florida. From his
experience and military skill, I had expected to derive much aid, and
this communication has been delayed by the hope to avail myself
of them.

adopted by the General Government, and rigorously enforced, put

REPORT OF TERRITORIAL SENATE RE INDIAN AFFAIRS
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[March 2, 1840]
The committee on the state of the Territory to whom was refered
the special message of His Excellency the Gov. on the subject of the
Indian War,” make the following report that the condition of the
Territory call loudly for the adoption of immdiate action measures
by the Government of the United States, to repress the recurence
of further acts of hostility by those savage murderers—
The murder of the two mail carriers in the East, together with the
murders in the West so pathetically portrayed in the message refered—
although awful in their caracter, scarcely place the condition of affairs
in any worse light than they have been for the last two years; The
Legislative Council have at previous sessions strongly urged upon
the authorities of the United States the adoption of some rigorous
measures in relation to this war * and the late Executive officer of
the Territory was incessant in his appeals to Washington on this
subject, in which various plans were reccommended, all of which,
as well as the memorials of the Legislative Council, have been treated
with silent contempt, and the people of Florida have been abandoned
to their fate, in a stern and unrelenting manner by the Head of the
War Department—During the present session of the Legislative
council, not withstanding the members were satisfied that the situa-
tion of the country called loudly for relief. there was a disposition on
their part generally to say more to Congress, or the Heads of De-
partments, at Washington than had been already so often and so
ineffectually urged: and it was not intended by us to obtrude our-
selves further on the notice of the Government. But the message of
the Governor has called on us to make one more appeal & which it is
earnestly hoped will not share the fate of previous memorials &
petitions on this subject-
The committee has indulged the hope that the Bill passed by the
Senate of the United States (which bill was introduced by the Hon
Senator from Missouri") would have been so modified as to have
required an organization of the settlers produced to be introduced in
the manner suggested in the memorial of the Legislative Council of

commands, & would moreover have secured to us the service of a
body of respectable & hardy citizens from the adjoining states, of
Georgia Alabama & South Carolina, who will never enter the service

A copy of this memorial is sent herewith,” with the hope that the
suggestions contained in it, may meet with the favourable notice of
Congress should this Bill be still under consideration—Should not this
or other measures be devised by Congress, your Committee would

TALLAHASSEE Flor. March 5* 1840.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY M. WAN BUREN President of the United States.
SIR Since the election for Delegate in May last, Circumstances
have occurred which have greatly increased the numbers of those who
were opposed to the election of the gentleman who fills that station.
His course towards the Administration—that in regard to the admis-
sion of Florida as a State, and the Division of the Territory—that in
regard to the Florida faith bond Banks and those speculators who
have been dabbling in spurious grants *—And his Conduct with
respect to appointments to office here, have Created distrust and want
of Confidence with many who have heretofore been inclined to be his
friends. Especially are the true friends of the Administration here
satisfied that so far from representing their wishes and feelings fairly,
he is in truth and in fact with the enemy. Florida is in a Critical
position. The events of a few months will have a lasting effect upon
her future political character. The Democratic party here if not
sustained at Washington—if the influence of the present Delegate
directly or his secret efforts through others indirectly are allowed to
sway, will encounter difficulty in maintaining their ground, and the
new State may be found in Congress arrayed against the Administra-
tion. The mass of our people are Democratic. If strengthened and

SIR Information has been received here from a source which I
think entitled to credit, of the death of Samuel. H. Duval Marshal
of this District who left a short time since for Pensacola. At the last
January term of the Court of Appeals, I obtained rule against him
and his securities (a copy which I enclose)* to compel the payment
of certain monies arising from the sale of the Schooner Emperor,
which was sold by him, by order of Court as will appear by the rule,
which vessel has since been forfeited to the U States by the decree
of the Court of appeals. No return has been made to the rule by
the Marshal. I understand the vessel sold for $16.00.
M” Duval had a claim against the U States for keeping eight
African negroes, imported in this vessel which is yet unsettled, Also
a claim of $400 for informing against said negroes. The object of the
present letter is to request that these claims due the late Marshal may
be appropriated to the payment into the registry of the Court the
proceeds of the sale of the Schooner Emperor.
There is also an account due by him to the General Post Office for
monies collected on execution. I have no doubt that on a settlement
of his current accounts with the United States, the Government will
fall in debt to him.
It may perhaps be important that I should be furnished forthwith
with certified copies of any official bond or bonds executed by him,
which may have been forwarded to Washington. Different sets of
Bonds, I learn, were executed with different securities, and it is

believed if the securities should be sufficient, which is doubted, to
meet the demands of Plaintiff’s, dispute will be made on account
of the tenor of the bonds &" I had nothing to do with the execution of
the Bonds, I believe, and can state nothing with regard to them.
May I ask of you to enquire for me at the Treasury or State Depart-
ment for any bonds which may have been transmitted and forward
me copies, as also the date of his Official Oath on file. They will be

off from it. The Territorial Legislature also directed one term of the
Superior Court to be held annually at Dade County so that by exist-
ing laws jurors cannot be drawn from one county to serve in the other.
Congress in the year 1836 annulled the Territorial law establishing a
court in Dade "yet it was re-enacted by the Legislative Council at
its very next session in 1837 * and has remained in force since that
period.
Criminal justice cannot be administered at all in Dade County
there being but about twenty jurors in the whole county which num-
ber is too limited to form grand & pettit Juries. In Monroe County
there are but about fifty jurors and after rejecting a jury of inquest
and the grand jury, persons indicted for murder avail themselves of
the right of twenty peremptory challenges and escape a trial. The
Act of Congress for 1836 authorises the sending of criminals with their
indictments to the Eastern or Middle District for trial when there is a
deficiency of jurors in Monroe and to bind witnesses to appear there.
Yet it makes no provision for paying the expenses of such witnesses.
At the last session of the Court at Key West, Jose Honquin, a Portu-
guese, was indicted for murder; but for want of jurors, he was sent to
Tallahassee, a distance of 400 miles, for trial at a great expense to
Government. Twelve or thirteen witnesses have been recognised to
appear there, all of whom are poor and most of them cannot obtain
the money necessary for the voyage. There is now another prisoner
in jail on the charge of murder, who will be indicted at the May term
& will probably be sent away for trial. Since 1837 three persons,
charged with Capital offences have been sent away for trial for want
of jurors—and they have escaped from prisons, or been acquitted,
having been tried so great a distance from the residences of witnesses,
that few could be induced to appear. The citizens of the county of
Monroe have repeatedly petitioned, joined with the great bulk of the
people of Dade, the Legislative Council, to abolish the court held in
Dade County and authorise jurors to be summoned from the whole
judicial District, which would ensure the administration of justice.
But these petitions have failed to produce any favorable result.
The people feeling that they are deprived of the ordinary protection
by the sure administration of justice are now organizing Lynch tribu-
nals—a resort of fearful tendency, leading the minds of men to dis-
regard all law.
We the undersigned respectfully pray that the Territorial law of 1837
reestablishing a term of the Superior Court in the County of Dade
be annulled and abolished and that the Territorial Legislature be pro-

JUDGE BALCH TO THE PRESIDENT
[LC:Van Buren Papers:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE 3"April, 40.
DEAR SIR, I reached here on the 30" Ultimo after a detention on
the road from high waters. The whole country was flooded. Some
sensation arose amongst the friends and connexions of Judge Randall
when the fact was made known that he was superseded, and some
displeasure was felt towards me individually. I saw this difficulty
in two hours after my arrival and determined if possible to walk out
of it. Genl Call took no notice of me and rode by my lodgings whilst
I was standing at the door but he did not deign to speak to me. As
he is a leader here I was anxious to be on terms with him and the
more especially as he has suits depending which I may be called on
to try. If we were at points he might suppose me disinclined to do
him exact justice. In conversation with a neutral individual of
respectability I was asked if Genl Call had waited on me to which
I replied that he had not and that I deeply regretted it. This individ-
ual I have no doubt communicated the remark for Genl Call came to
see me this morning. The condition of affairs in this territory is
deplorable. The leading men are divided into bitter parties and
violence is the order of the day. Heretofore the Banking influence
has been predominant, but now the most determined resistance is
made to it and in fact it is tottering to its foundations as well it may
since the paper of the Union Bank here is 25 per cent below Virginia
paper and Virginia paper is 8 per cent below specie. The circulation
of the Union Bank is $550,000 its specie $13,000. But, I refer you
to Mr Blackburns report which it may be well for you to read when
you have leisure. Govr Branch," who is a most honorable and
honest man has been with me twice and communicated to me all
his confidential views. He and his party are vehemently opposed
to the Bank and yet he & his party are Stockholders in and borrowers
from the Bank and of course helped to make it. It is true they own
but little stock and have borrowed but little. I suggested to the Govr
that he & his friends should procure instantly as much of the paper of
the Bank as would discharge their liabilities and should then sell out
their stock to the Bank at any price then washing their hands of the
whole affair. The suggestion struck the Gov” like a thunder-bolt
and he said that he would see to it instantly. Every body here is
in favour of the admission of the territory as a state—some are in
favour of creating two states and some are in favor of only one. But,
* John Branch, a former Governor of North Carolina, who was appointed
Governor of Florida Territory in 1844. See post, p. 943.

if Popes Bill" already reported is passed all will acquiesce. Hardly
any body can be found here, who is not in favour at least by profession
of your re-election. And there cannot be a doubt that a very large
majority are sincerely in favour of your administration. One objec-
tion strongly urged against making middle and west Florida a state
is, that it will create delay and prevent her from giving her vote to
you in November. I beleive this objection to be sincere with many.
Very large numbers of actions of debt are depending in the Courts of
this District. My coming so suddenly disappointed the debtor
class who counted upon a delay of six months from the want of a
judge. The Creditor class are highly pleased.
I reached here in the nick of time—my first court sits on Monday
in Hamilton county on the Swanney 100 miles from here—I set
out to morrow. My court sits in the adjoining county of Madison
the Monday following—in Jefferson the monday after then here and
lastly in Gadsden at the town of Quincy. You have assigned such a
difficult part to play before this distracted, mercurial, impetuous
and generous people in whom it is easy to see at a glance that there
are the elements of a strong and enlightened community. But, I
shall make it my object to pursue an honest course. An honest man
has nothing to fear before those amongst whom his lot is cast.
My steps will be taken with Caution—It is my intention to try
every cause on the Common Law or Chancery Dockets that is at
issue so that the suitors may turn their attention to other business
and so that the people may see that the Adm" has sent a man amongst
them who will transact their business for them."
Very respectfully & sincerely yours

the 22" and their preparation commenced on the day following, and
were completed on the 26" Ult” in a highly satisfactory manner.
The Calculations have now to be made to ascertain their respective
areas & which by the Calculation of the Surveyor amounts in the
gross, to, One Million, four hundred twenty seven thousand five
hundred and ninety eight 88/100 acres including the point yet unde-
termined at the Fortress of St Marks—There will be sixteen town
plats to make shewing the connexion of the public lands with this
Survey (3 copies of each numbering in all forty eight), the subdivi-
sions & calculations of which, will be another arduous task: but my
Clerk M. Nunes possesses a high degree of application for business,
with an aptitude seldom equaled and withal a cheerful and willing
spirit all of which I take pleasure in giving witness to—I have not
made any additional appointments in this office from a belief that we
are entirely competent for the present to perform the duties current,
and no wish to make sinecure appointments; therefore shall only do
so when I see the prospect brighter for the full extension of field
operations all of which I hope you will readily approve."
I am very respectfully &c

GOVERNOR REID TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[NA:SD, Misc. Lets.:ALS]
Executive Department; TALLAHASSEE 6th April 1840–
SIR, In two of the Acts organizing the Territorial Government,
the Governor is required to cause the Laws to be published “through-
out the Territory””—but an Act of Congress subsequently passed,
directs that the Legislature shall not order the Laws to be published
“in more than three Newspapers.”” My impression is that the last
Law imposes no restriction upon the power given to the Governor by
the Organic Laws. So circumscribed is the circulation of every news-

paper in the Territory, and so remote the settled portions of the
Country and the principal Towns from each other—that there is an
evident propriety in publishing the Laws in more than three News-

tine—and Tallahassee; and I wish to have them published at
Apalachicola and Pensacola, should you concur with me in opinion
that I have authority to do so.-Perhaps I ought not to trouble you
with this matter and should act upon my own opinion, but I prefer
to have yours if you will favor me with it 7"

April 15th 1840.
HON C. DOWNING House of Representatives.
SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 2" instant,”
enclosing a memorial of “sundry respectable citizens of St Augustine
to be allowed to raise a company of twenty five men under the
command of Papy Sanches to scout in that neighborhood”.
In reply I have respectfully to inform you that, permission was
sometime since given for raising a company at St Augustine,” but
on a representation from General Taylor that he had taken ample
measures for the protection of the vicinity of St Augustine, and that it
was unadvisable on many accounts to authorize the employment of
separate and independent bodies of troops, that permission was with-
drawn. This for the reasons assigned was satisfactory to the author-
ities of St Augustine, on whose application the permission was granted.
The same authorities have recently made application for a supply of
arms and ammunition which has been complied with, and as the
attention of the department is now directed to the protection of that
vicinity and its intention is to give particular instructions on that
subject, it is deemed unnecessary and unadvisable to comply with
the application of the memorialists.

[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:DS 84]
[April 22, 1840]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States, in Congress Convened.—
Your Petitioners would respectfully represent. That the God of
Nature, made the Suwannee River the Division Line or Boundary,
between East and West Florida: and all subsequent earthly govern-

“The Division”, except the Government of the United States, which
placed the two Territories under one Governor.
Your Petitioners have read with deep satisfaction and interest “The
Bill” reported by the Hon M'. Pope in the House of Representatives
“To authorise the people of Middle & West Florida to form a constitu-
tion and State Government, and to provide for the admission of said
State into the union:” "And most cordially do your Petitioners wish
success and bid God speed to the middle & west, and to their project
of a New State.—and with all of that Bill, your Petitioners are well
suited, except with the last—or section thirteen, which reads as follows.
“Sec 13. And be it further enacted, That so soon as West Florida
shall be admitted into the Union as a State, East Florida shall be
established and constituted a separate Territory of the United States.”
Now Your Petitioners do most respectfully and earnestly ask and
petition your Honorable Body, so to amend “the Bill” aforesaid, as
that East Florida shall be “established and constituted a separate
Territory”—immediately after the said Bill shall have become a Law
of Congress, and that, without regards to, or dependance upon the
action of West Florida.—In short, Your Petitioners respectfully ask
and pray your Honorable Body to grant to East Florida Her ancient
birthright—Division—independent of the policy or action of the
Middle & West—and independent of any apprehended or threatened
procrastination designed to put off or defeat the just, wise, patriotic

GENERAL PRESENTMENTS OF THE CALHOUN COUNTY
GRAND JURY
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:AC]
[April 1840]
General Presentments, Of the Grand Jury, at the April Term 1840,
for the County of Calhoun, in the Superior Court.
The Grand Jury felicitate their fellow citizens upon the good order
which has prevailed in our County during the last six months. But
one case of a criminal character has come under the notice of their
body, and that case embraced within the class of the lightest offences—
When we reflect upon the state of our society a few years ago,
analogous, in its characteristics to most new settlements, where
violent bold and lawless men jostle in the common walks of life, the
peaceable and innofensive citizen, where the rights of the weak and
peaceable, are only respected so long as they do not come in the way
of the convenience, or the caprice, of the strong and the licentious,
and contrast with this, the present state of our society, the equal
protection and redress afforded to all our citizens, under the laws,
it affords a cheering evidence to the Patriot and the Philanthropist, of
the ameliorating and beneficient action of our system of Jurisprudence.
The Grand Jury consider it their duty to invoke the attention of
our Delegate in Congress, (as has heretofore been done through
various channels) to several subjects, vitally interesting to the rapidly
increasing Commerce of this Port.
We extract from the general Presentment of the Grand Jury of this
County for the April Term 1839,” and fully concur in and reiterate
the importance of their reccommendations.
“The Grand Jury, speaking in behalf of the County of Calhoun,
would take this occasion, through the Delegate to invoke the aid of
Congress in the erection of a Marine Hospital in the City of St Joseph.
There is no point in the Gulf so healthy or eligible, and the interest

of humanity and commerce alike demand that some provision be
made, on our Coast for the sick and pennyless Mariner, other recom-
mendations to this effect, from our citizens and from the Legislative
Council, have been forwarded to the Congress of the United States,
and to them, and to the Bill passed the House of Representatives, at
the last session, we ask the favourable consideration, of the present
Congress.
Connected in the most direct channel, by Railroad and water navi-
gation, with the interior of the States of Georgia and Alabama with
a flourishing foreign and domestic Commerce, and a deep and capa-
cious Harbour, we but promote the general interest of trade, and the
national government, in asking an official survey, by a government
officer of our Bar and Harbour. Contradictory opinions, by nautical
men have been expressed as to the depth of water, in the entrance to
St Joseph's Bay; all agree, however, that 20 feet, can be carried over
at a fair tide, and if this, or a deeper channel, can be found, is it not
the policy of government to fortify and improve this as a Naval
station, made preferable to Pensacola, by its connection with the
interior? We would therefore, suggest to our Delegate, that an
enquiry into the necessity and practicability of fortifications be
coupled with an examination of the Bar and Harbour, We would,
also, respectfully solicit an appropriation for placing Buoys, on the
middle ground, at the entrance to our Bay.
The Grand Jury, would also respectfully ask an appropriation of
$5000 dollars for the erection of a Court House in the City of St
Joseph. Its central position to the other Ports of West Florida point
it out as the most convenient site for the Courts of Admiralty after
Florida, shall have become a State, It is contemplated by the citizens
to subscribe a sum equal to that asked for, and as the U: States
Courts would occupy such building free of charge economy, would be
consulted in affording us the aid asked for.
It appears that the sixteenth section of Land, in this township
which under a general law of Congress, is appropriated for School
purposes, happens to lie in the Bay of St Joseph and we therefore
consider that the Citizens of this Township, under these circumstances
are peculiarly entitled to a float we respectfully call the attention of
our Delegate to the subject and ask his exertions to procure us an
other section of land in place of that referred to above.
The Grand Jury, would respectfully call the attention of Congress,
through our Delegate, to the necessity for the erection of a Peni-
tentiary, in this Territory. We hardly conceive it necessary at this
day, to use arguments, to enforce the importance of this subject.
The experience of all the States, has long since proved that the various


## p. 145 (#157) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 145
grades of Crime, cannot be appropriately punished without them.
In the absence of Penitentiaries, resort must be had, in the punish-
ment of malefactors, to corporeal inflictions a mode of punishment,
altogether abhorrent to the enlightened sentiments of the age we live
in, and when we reflect that under the penitentiary system of punish-
ment reformation may and frequently does comport with the execu-
tion of the sentence of the Law while under the system of corporeal
punishment now necessarily in practice here, such as cropping brand-
ing &" the indelible mark of infamy, is fixed upon the culprit, suspicion
attends his footsteps through life, the finger of scorn is always pointed,
a barrier is raised between him and respectable society which he can-
not pass if he would. The stimulus to virtuous exertion is gone, and
he wanders on through the world, an outcast from its humanities
and its sympathies, a marked and miserable man. Humanity, civi-
lization and Justice, therefore demand that Florida be releived from
the necessity of prosecuting a system of punishment so repugnant to
the benign policy of this enlightened day.
We notice that an appropriation has been granted by Congress to
the Territory of Iowa for the erection of a Penitentiary,” and we have
reason to believe that Congress will be equally liberal in a Donation
for this purpose to Florida.
The Grand Jury have remarked that a Bill has been introduced
into Congress by the Chairman of the Committee on Territories for
the partition of this Territory and the erection of middle and West
Florida into a state.” The object and the provisions of that Bill
meet their entire concurrence and they indulge an earnest hope that
it may receive the favourable consideration of Congress. An appro-
priation of $10.000 was made by Congress more than 12 months ago
for the construction of a Road from Iola to Tallahassee " and a survey
was ordered to be made forthwith. The Citizens of this County as
well as those of Gadsden and Leon Counties are much interested in
the speedy completion of this work and we have been waiting, with
much anxiety, to see a demonstration made to that effect; but so far,
nothing has been done. The Grand Jury cannot conceive any good
reason for this delay and would respectfully direct the attention of
our Delegate in Congress to this subject.
* A bill to aid Iowa Territory in completing the building of a penetentiary was
introduced in the House, Mar. 16, 1840 (House Journal, 26 Cong., 1 sess., p. 595).
No further action noted. On Jan. 20, 1840, a similar bill was introduced in the
Senate (Senate Journal, 26 Cong., 1 sess., p. 109), for an additional appropriation
to the same end, but no action followed.

HIS EXCELLENCY R. R. REID Governor of Florida Tallahassee. Florida.
SIR, By direction of the President of the United States, I have the
honor to request that, on the requisition of Brigadier General Armi-
stead, commanding the forces in Florida,” you will call into the service
of the United States, a militia force which, together with such portion
of that now in the service, both of the United States, and of the Terri-
tory as may wish to continue in service, will not exceed one thousand
men with a due proportion of Officers, and the Officer highest in rank
to be Colonel. General Armistead has been instructed to call upon
your Excellency for this force," and to cause the force in the service of
the territory to be mustered as having been in the service of the
United States from the time they were called out by the authority of
the territory. He has also been told that, as the object of the force
now called for, is to protect the settlements, he must, in stationingit,
be governed by the views of the Officer of the rank of Colonel, selected
by you to command it.”

[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 22]

BVT BRIG GENERAL W. K. ARMISTEAD Commanding Army of the
South. S." Augustine, Florida.
SIR, The determination of the department, lately signified to you,
to take into the service of the Government one thousand militia to aid
in the defence of Florida:” and the late attacks made upon our
scouting parties by large bodies of Indians, showing that they are
concentrating their forces, render it advisable to change, in some
measure, the plan of defence adopted by General Taylor previous to
his departure from Florida.
The posts which ought to be occupied by the Regular forces are
Pilatka; Two forts east of the St Johns, between Pilatka and Fort
Russell, Fort King, Wheelock, Micanopy, Walkahoote, Wacasscissa,
one between Wacassassa and Fort Fanning and Fort Fanning. The
stations at Cedar Keys, at Weedmans, Smyrna, Forts Pierce and
Lauderdale, Key Biscayne and Tampa may be kept up likewise by
the Regulars—the remainder will be occupied by the Militia. It will
be better to establish three posts from Dunn's lake to Peliciers creek-
one at Rowl's town—one at the Creek and one between them which
will allow Fort Hanson and Fort Peyton to be abandoned. The
movements here recommended must be made gradually, and discreetly,
so as to expose the settlements as little as possible, and in conjunction
with the Officer commanding the Militia force under you, you will
station that force so as to afford protection to that portion of the
Country from which the regulars will be withdrawn.
It is the intention of the department to make Picolata a recruiting
station and place of rendezvous for one of the battalions in the event
of the passage of the bill now before Congress to raise an additional
force for Florida.
You are requested to give positive instructions to the Officer who is
charged with mustering the Militia into the service of the United
States to receive none but able bodied men—The department has
been informed that very young boys have been mustered into the
service, a practice which must be discountenanced. The protection
of Florida, both West of the Suwannee and North of the line of posts
you are directed to establish, being entrusted to the Florida Militia,
it is important that those companies should all be composed of men
capable of doing military duty."
* See post, p. 162.
* See Armistead to the Secretary of War, May 28, 1840 (NA, WD, SW, Reg.
of Lets. Recd., A46), advising that he had called for 1000 militia, but that he
could not raise that number of soldiers; he recommended an additional force
of 500 or 1000. He also noted the establishment of a hospital at Picolata.

as possible every event of interest that occurs in Florida. Information
of every description which concerns the Army, is generally first re-
ceived at the department of War through the medium of the News-

In mentioning the posts to be occupied, I intended chiefly to desig-

practicable, good water, Military advantages and healthfulness."

Mr B. on behalf of the Committee on claims, desires to know if
the existing laws do not authorize the payment of the claim, and,
if not, whether a special act of Congress will be necessary for his
relief? I am of opinion that the laws, as they are, do not authorize
the adjustment of this claim. Certain Agencies are established and
Agents appointed, who are paid by appropriations regularly made by
Congress—Of the Seminoles Major John Phagan was the Agent when
this claim arose—and of this class of officers there could be but one
title in commission or under pay as such at the same time. It follows
that if congress think Major Graham entitled to relief, a special act
will be necessary to give it.
Altho’ not specificaly asked for, I think it my duty to mention
that by the act of 30 June 1834,” which organized the Indian Depart-
ment, (Sec. 13.) military officers, who are in the service of this office,
shall perform the duties required of them, “without any other com-
pensation than their actual traveling expenses.” Since that time
then, no allowance can be claimed, (except as mentioned,) for services.
The case of Capt. Page referred to by Major Graham in his letter of
4 Nov. 1837” to you I have inquired into. It appears that Capt.
P. was allowed for his services as sub agent from 1. July 1827 to 31.
December 1828, at the rate of $500, per annum, which was paid out
of an appropriation made by an act of Congress, passed on 27. January
1831, “for closing certain accounts and making appropriations for
arrearages in the Indian Department.”.” There is no fund out of
which payment of the present claim could be made at the disposal
of the Department.
From all I can learn Major Graham rendered useful services, and
expended his own funds, and I regard his claim as an equitable one,
entitled to favorable consideration.
Very respectfully &c

had been placed with others under Capt. Guion of the Corps. But
the indian disturbances in that quarter and the ill health of Capt
Guion have prevented him from attending to it. He is now on leave
of absence. As it is extremely desirable that this road should be
opened as soon as practicable, I have to direct that you will repair
to Tallahassee & put the same under contract, or as much of it as
the unexpended balance of the appropriation will cover. This balance
is of $9500.00, but it would not be proper that the contract should
cover more than $9000.00, as the $500.00 may be wanted for
unforeseen contingencies.
Should an escort be necessary to any duty you may have to perform,
you can probably obtain it from the troops near Tallahassee, should
you fail in this, however, and should you be well satisfied that the
duties you may have to perform in reference to the road, cannot well
be made without an escort, you will delay operations, return to
Savannah and report the result."

SIR, I have the honor to transmit to you for the information of the
Committee on Military Affairs, two letters received this morning from
Florida. They represent a state of things requiring the adoption of
the most active and vigorous measures to protect that territory from
the renewed and repeated attacks of the Indians, who appear to have
again concentrated their forces. The Department of War has been for
some time past anxiously looking to Congress for its action upon the
bill introduced into the House of Representatives by the Committee
this session,” and I feel justified by the exigency of the case, once more
earnestly to solicit your attention to it and ask the cooperation of the
Committee to procure an early decision of Congress upon it in order
that the Department may organize without further delay the force that

GENERAL, I wrote to you on the 22" inst.” informing you of our
disasters near Ft Micanopy, and I now have more to relate.
Yesterday we received notice, that Ft Crum had been taken by the
Indians, and all the occupants, save one, killed, also, that two express
riders had been killed between Forts No 11 & 12. Fort Crum lies
about six miles from Ft Micanopy, & has of late been occupied by an
association of citizens, having plantations in that vicinity. The
number killed is not reported—For the truth of the above we have
only the word of the express rider from No 11, but the late occurences
in that vicinity & other circumstances give strength to his report.
To day we are informed, & of this there is no doubt, that yesterday in
the afternoon, two persons coming from St Augustine were killed &
their wagons & horses destroyed, Also, that of a party proceeding from
Picolata to St Augustine, one was killed & two are missing—This last
party was a company of actors, who have been of late performing at Ft
Heileman—Gen'l Armistead is now in the field with about a thousand
men, and we look anxiously for news from his command”—

(EASTERN DISTRICT)
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.: DS]
[June 10, 1840]
To the Honorable—The Senate & House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled
The undersigned would respectfully suggest that by means of the
present Indian War in Florida & the unsettled state of the Country
Consequent thereon it is very difficult & dangerous & sometimes
impossible to hold Courts in the interior Counties of the District of
East Florida, whereby the due administration of the Laws is much
impeded, and the trial for, or punishment of Crimes is extremely un-
certain & tardy—Therefore to remedy in some measure this evil your
memorialists would recommend that a law may be passed providing
that during the continuance of the present war persons who are or
hereafter may be arrested or charged with felonies or crime committed
within the District of East Florida may be indicted arraigned &
tried in the County of St Johns in said District at any term of the
Superior Court therein to be holden or at any other regular term of
said Court duly holden in any county in said District—
And your petitioners pray that such a Law may be passed or some
other Law authorising the trial of offenders in any county of said
District—and that any Law of the Territorial Legislature of Florida,
or ordinance or Decree repugnant thereto be annulled—

SIR. The case of loss by mail heretofore reported by you & in

J.M.N.
THOMAS DOUGLAS TO THE SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY
[NA: TD, ST Lets. from Individuals, Land Offices: LS]
District Attorneys Office ST. AUGUSTINE E. F. June 20th 1840
SIR. Your letter of the 25th. Ult:” respecting private land
claims has been received, in that letter you request me to “report
the number of private Land claims now remaining undecided in the
courts of Florida, and the probable period when it is expected they
will be determined.”
I am also requested to “state how much of my time has been
devoted within the last two years, in attending to the interests of
the U.S. in relation to those claims and what attention will be
required the present year.”
In reply I have the honour to state that the number of private
Land claims now remaining undecided in this District (and I am not
aware that there are any elsewhere in Florida) is thirty, embracing
in the aggregate 987,635 acres of land and that it is expected that
most of them will be submitted to the Court for its final action at
the ensuing term thereof in July next, when I doubt not but a large
portion of them will be determined; so far as they can be determined
in this Court: owing to the death of Complainants occurring in vaca-
tion, and the consequent want of parties, which in most instances is
unknown to me until the cases are called up in Court, it generally
happens that some cases have to be continued for this cause at every
Term, our July Term in 1841 therefore is as soon as it can reasonably

be expected that the whole of them will be determined but I shall
spare no pains or exertions which may be necessary to insure the
determination of as many of them as possible at the approaching
Term—
As to the next question “how much of my time within the last
two years has been devoted to the interests of the U.S. in relation to
these claims” it is impossible for me to answer as I “have taken no
note of time” these cases never did occupy much of the time of either
the Court or counsel during Term, except in the trial of the claim of
Arredondo & Son to what is familiarly called the Alachua Grant, in
this case which was the first that was tried, most of the testimony
was taken in open court, but the practice was found exceedingly
inconvenient and was therefore virtually abandoned. Since the trial
of that cause nearly all the testimony has been taken in vacation,
the proceedings are all made up and interlocutory orders are taken
in vacation and upon all important questions either of law or fact,
the Counsel have been in the habit of submitting very full briefs or
written arguments these are also prepared by the counsel and
received and considered by the Judge in vacation.
There are but few, in any, of these cases which do not contain
some point or question that may have an important bearing upon
similar cases arising upon Spanish, French or British Grants in those
portions of our Country acquired by the Cession of Louisiana &
Florida consequently I have deemed them important beyond their
own respective intrinsic merits and have consequently devoted most
earnestly a large portion of my time to the various questions arising
in them ever since I have had them in charge.
At almost every Session of The Supreme Court, for several years
past and especially at the last Term, questions have been decided
having such a bearing upon these cases as to make a reexamination
of them necessary to see how far the principles settled applied to
them, and what further preparation was requisite to meet the
questions thus newly but finally settled.
In reply to the last question what attention will be required the
present year.—
I have to observe that it is partly answered already, I shall as
before stated endeavour the ensuing Term to submit as many of
them as possible to the Court for its final action, but I have to re-
mark that when they shall have been argued & submitted the Duties
of the District Attorney in regard to them are not yet done,—by the
Act of Congress under which these claims are adjudicated, it is
provided “That it shall be the duty of the attorney of the United
States for the District in which the suits authorised by this act shall
be instituted, in any case where the decision is against the United

States, to make out and transmit to the Attorney General of the
United States, a statement containing the facts of the case and the
point of law on which the same were decided; and that it shall be
the duty of the Attorney General in all cases where the claim exceeds
one league square, and in all other cases if he shall in such latter
cases think the decision of the District Judge erroneous, to direct an
appeal to be made to the Supreme Court of the United States—see
act of 234 May 1828" sec 9 chap: 364–: it will be observed that
by this provision an appeal must be made in all cases where the claim
exceeds one league square & the decision is against The United States
and may be directed in all other cases:—Seventeen of these claims
exceed one league square-
The Complainants too have a right of appealing when the decision
is against them and by the instruction of the Solicitor of the Treasury
contained in his circular of the 1* May 1839," The District Attorney
is required “whenever an appeal is taken to report the same to him,
and to cause a transcript of the record certified by the Clerk to be
transmitted to his office together with a note of the points made and
authorities referred to in the Court below.
The Fiat for an appeal in these cases is sent down by the Attorney
General to the District Attorney and it is the duty of the latter to
take the appeal, cause a citation to be issued see that it is duly served
and in all cases to cause a transcript of the record to be made and
certified by the Clerk & transmitted to the office of the Solicitor of
the Treasury, and when The United States appeal another copy of
the record is to be made out and sent up to the office of the Clerk
of the Supreme Court; it is the duty of the District Attorney to
examine the records and see that they are made out correctly and
especially whether they contain all the evidence which was adduced
in the case on behalf of the United States. When a case has been
decided in the Supreme Court a mandate comes down to this Court
and it frequently happens that the case has been reversed in whole
or in part and it is also the duty of the District Attorney to see that
the mandate is duly entered and to take such proceedings thereon
as the interest of the United States may require in the premises.
And in addition to all this the Attorney General under date of the
24 of March last *wrote me as follows, viz:
“You will oblige me by forwarding to me notes as full as may be
convenient of the arguments in your Court when an appeal is taken;

SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of
the 11" inst. in which you inform me of my dismissal from office of
Attorney of the United States for the Middle District of Florida."
By your communication I am also to understand that the President
has been induced to remove me by “information recently received”
My surprize is indescribable. My conscience acquits me of any
moral delinquency antecedent or subsequent to my appointment
My devotion to the principles of the present Administration and
my desire for their renewed triumph in the approaching crisis, renders
this assault upon my feelings and reputation the more agonizing
My unbounded confidence in the magnanimity and justice of the
President, assure me that nothing but an inflexible sense of duty has
influenced him in taking this step towards me.
I will only ask an opportunity (if such a right is not by policy
denied me) to vindicate myself against any charge or charges which
may have been preferred. I would much desire to know what they
are and by whom made, for conscious rectitude of principle and
action encourages me to assure the President that I can satisfy him
that there is no just cause for my dismissal.

SIR I herewith enclose a copy, marked A, of Dr Henry Perrine's
letter of the 17" inst" asking the attention of this Office to the provi-
sions contained in the 1" & 2" Sections (Copy enclosed marked B)
of the Act entitled “An Act to encourage the introduction and promote
the cultivation of tropical plants in the United States” Approved
July 7, 1838,” and requesting that instructions may be issued to you
for the Survey of the six miles square selected by him which he de-
scribes as lying “along the South coast of the Peninsula, Eastward of
Cape Sable, or of the projecting land called Punta Tancha on Spanish
Charts, and North ward of the Sandy Islands of which one is called
Cayo Axi on several Charts.”
I have to request that you will at your earliest convenience have
the Survey of the township in question made under the direction of
Dr Perrine as provided in the 1" & 2" Sections of the Act. You will
perceive that by the 1* Section, none but public lands can be taken,
and by the 2" that the location must not embrace any land having
sufficient quantities of naval timber to be reserved to the United
States, nor any sites for Maratime ports or Cities, and you will there-
fore be particular in your instructions to the Deputy whom you may
employ to require him not to include such lands in the Survey.
You will of course confer with D* Perrine on the subject of the
Survey, whose letter is dated at Indian Key Florida Territory, where
it is presumed your communications will reach him, and should you
experience any difficulty in procuring a Deputy to undertake the
service it may perhaps be in his power to obviate it.”

TO Dr HENRY PERRINE
SIR, The Commissioner of the General Land office under date of
29" Ulto has call'd my attention to the fulfillment of the Act of
Congress approved July 7" 1838,” in consequence of your communica-
tion of 17 June last " (a copy of which is now before me) wherein
you have pointed out a location for six miles square or township of
land granted by said act and asking for the Survey of the Same under
you direction
In compliance with my instructions and your wishes I take the
earliest moment to advise you that the survey of the contemplated
Township embraces in exterior and section lines Seventy two miles
which at the compensation allow'd by law amounts at $4 per mile to
$288, the land laws & instructions also require the survey to be made
at right angles due North & South & east & West & six miles square.—
The compensation being so small, the distance from hence so great
the amt to be surveyed, only a few days employment, that no sur-
veyor could be induced to undertake the Survey without other &
reasonable compensation being guaranteed to him by the claimant—
Such as a p" diam allowance & expenses found I therefore (from the
last clause of the Comm” letter) which is “and should you experi-
ence any difficulty in procuring a deputy to undertake the service
it may perhaps be in his power to obviate it) respectfully, enquire
whether you know any person near you who is competent & would
undertake the Survey, when instructions could be sent under cover
to you with duplicate contracts & an oath of office for the person to
execute & his return of plat & field notes received by mail or private
conveyance without the necessity of coming here, the oath of office
will embrace beyond the usual form—“that the Survey when executed

shall not embrace any land having sufficient quantities of naval timber
to be reserved to the United States nor any cites for maratine posts

GENERAL LEIGH READ of the Florida Militia Washington City.
SIR, The Governor of Florida has been authorised and called
upon to furnish fifteen hundred Militia"—One thousand to be
mounted, and five hundred to serve on foot—to form together a
Brigade of which you will take the command.
The object of raising this force is to afford protection to the settle-
ments in Florida, which it is believed can only be effected by driving
from thence the Indians now within the portion of territory assigned
to your command, and preventing their return to it when pressed
upon by the Regular forces now operating in East Florida.
Those troops occupy a line of posts extending from the Atlantic
South of S" Augustine including two stations East of the St John's
River, Pilatka, Wheelock, Micanopy, Walkahoote, Wacassissa and
a fort between the last station and Fort Fanning and Cedar Keys.
These stations are mentioned, in order to designate the line beyond
which your command will not extend—It is the intention of the depart-
ment to constitute Picolata a recruiting station, and both that post
and S*Augustine may be required for the occupation of the Regular
forces—
The operations of the Militia hereby confided to your command will
be confined to the North of, and within the line herein designated,
and it is expected that the force at your disposal, and the knowledge
the Officers and men are supposed to possess of the Country and of
the haunts of the enemy, will enable you to afford complete protec-
* Dr. Henry Perrine, a noted botanist of the period, had enscribed a memorial
to Congress on Feb. 6, 1832 (printed with enclosures, H. Rept. No. 564, 25 Cong.,
2 sess., 99 pp.), urging the consideration of southern Florida as a seat for the
production of tropical products.

tion to the settlements, and finally to capture or destroy the merciless
Indians who have so long ravaged that portion of Florida. The de-
partment will not attempt to restrict your operations by minute
instructions, but the most unceasing vigilance, and the most active
exertions to protect the plantations and homesteads of the
Floridians, and to harass and destroy the enemy, are enjoined on you.
No system of defence in the opinion of the department can succeed
but one of incessant scout, attack and pursuit.
Those people who have been driven from their homes are to be
encouraged to return to their plantations, and to reestablish them-
selves within them, and every facility and protection is to be afforded
them for that purpose. Every such settlement should be provided
with a blockhouse to which the family may retire in case of danger,
and every encouragement is to be given to the settlers to raise supplies
of provisions for themselves and for the use of the troops.
Your command will be supplied with Officers of the regular Staff
for the administrative service of the troops, a measure deemed neces-
sary to prevent the difficulties which have heretofore been produced
in the settlement of accounts from the inexperience of Militia Quarter
Masters.”

[Enclosure: ALS]
T. S. Brown to Governor Reid
(Private)(2) [May 6, 1840]
TO HIS EXCELLENCY ROBERT RAYMOND REID Governor of Florida
Having been engaged in the examination of the affairs of the Union
Bank of Florida, the Bank of Pensacola and the Branch and Agency
of the Southern Life Insurance & Trust Company at Apalachicola and
at St Joseph where the business of that company has been chiefly
conducted and its office in Tallahassee, I make to your Excellency for
the better understanding of the reports of the Committee of the House
of Representatives and the Commissioners appointed by yourself
the present communication which in addition to a general review of
the aforesaid reports and suggestions thereupon contains matters
based upon my own convictions established on Verbal communications
with officers of the institutions during the progress of our in-
vestigation—
Upon the Union Bank of Florida the report of the Committee of the
House of Representatives of the Legislative Council is so full in
Matters of both argument and opinion that little further need be
said but I would call the attention of your Excellency to the probable
fact that the loans withheld from investigation are in many instances
made in large amounts to few individuals upon weak security, a
General understanding of the Community is evidence on one part
which is fully corroberated by what has been divulged in regard to the
distribution of Stock so called based upon the division of Shares—
The Cotton transactions of the Bank during the past season so
extravagent in their nature demand an inquiry to establish the actual
Amount of Capital sacrificed—
I am far from any party feeling in this Matter and far from con-
desending the Managers of the Institution worse than other Men
similarly circumstanced; on the contrary with full reflection I consider
them above the low petty and chicanery which has disgraced so many
Banking Corporations but at the same they were (many of them)
Gentlemen led to extravagant and Aristocratic ideas whose reduced
Means ill comported with their former habits and who when once
involved in the new, and I may say Super-artificial credit system
introduced by the Sale abroad of State Security mistook the Stream
for the fountain and Wasted the Waters with unheedfull prodigality
An estimate of the losses already sustained by the Bank is without
further investigation simply speaking on supposition but it appears to
me that a proper examination would show a deficiency of full five
hundred thousand dollars already accrued by bad securities and
expensive negociations and if this be the fact every struggle of the

Bank to mantain or improve its credit must tend to a rapid diminution
of the Capital for the raising of which the bonds were sold—
In regard to any remedial suggestions If I supposed a Territorial
act of incorporation of any Walidity whatever or that the pledge of
faith upon which the Bonds were issued at all binding on the people of
Florida, I would were the Legislature in Session not hesitate to recom-
mend that the affairs of the Union Bank should be placed in liquidation
and perhaps justice might demand in as much as innocent parties
abroad may have been deceived by the use made of the name of the
Territory that measures should be devised to prevent any further
depreciation of the Security which the Bond holders hold in the Bank—
A regard also to the the rights of their constituents might induce the
Legislative Council to provide that the parties so few in Number now
controlling the Bank whose interest in paying both principal and
interest due by them must always lead to depreciating the Currency
to the lowest possible rate should no longer possess the power which
under the Law as it now stands is paramount to the will of the com-
munity whatever be their numbers their Wealth or their character—
In making these suggestions I would derogate nothing from the
honest and honorable intentions of the Directors or Controllers of
the Union Bank but the public mind is not yet relieved from the
fallacies of the Hamiltonian School which teach that “Money can be
made plenty” or that men can become suddenly rich not by wealth
honestly inherited from industrious fathers or labouriously acquired
by themselves but by faithfull schemes and the eccentric Action of
Legislative bodies which schemes however masked by words terminate
in one invariable design—the creation into bodies polotic of aristo-
cratic idlers who with corporate priviledges levy an onerous tax upon
the frugal sober minded and industrious to be expanded wholly in
luxury and vain parade by these idlers who produce nothing thereby
exposing our American principal of “equal rights” to bitter Sarcasm
and introducing distructions of “poor” and “rich” (without regard
to talent usefulness or integrity) alike destructive to republican
institutions and the great charter of Heaven that accompanied our
forefathers to this Continent
While these Hamiltonian doctrines are unblushingly promulgated
by the entire Whig press and entire Whig influence of the United
States it is not to be admitted that the controllers who are also the
“indebted” of the Union Bank whatever may be their high character
or Moral worth as amiable Citizens can be entirely free from the
influence of human fallacies and Weakness—The Maintainance of
their present ascendency the pecuniary aid in being perhaps of many

of their families depends upon a constant and continued depreciation
of the Currency in Florida, Every dollar of debt or interest due by
them to the Bank is now paid with Sixty five cents and could the
paper money be further depreciated by getting a greater quantity
into circulation the dollars would be paid with fifty Cents or twenty
five cents—
Whatever may be said of the “Scarcity of Money” that the outcry
is unworthy of being termed either contemptable ridiculous or untrue
is proved by the fact that the only currency of Middle Florida (Bills
of the Union Bank) is so redundant that it is depreciated at least
35 p” Cent below the only medium of Currency recognized by the
Constitution of the United States and 25 p" Cent below the rates of
Specie paying Banks in the Neighbouring States, Nor have the public
to thank the Bank that the currency is no worse for it attempted to
establish an Agency at Apalachicola for the purchase of Cotton
which fortunately did not succeed. Could this intended Agency
have forced two hundred thousand dollars into circulation by that
process instead of being at 25 p Cent discount Union Bank bills
would be this day at 50 p Cent discount in Tallahassee—
By its own statement the Bank had outstanding Bills in circulation
on the 1" April Amounting to $558,000 of which $130,000 was in
the hands of the Agency at S" Joseph and the Agencys of the Southern
Life Insurance & Trust Co" and the Bank of Pensacola, the remaining
$400,000 (for I know not where else it can be since it is useless abroad)
must be in the pockets of the people between Washington County
and the Sawannee, This circulation so far from being unequal to the
Wants is extravagantly redundant for the population of the district—
I do not say that every Man has “enough” for Bank Bills like Bank
favors may be unequally distributed but if every Man has not
“enough” it must be because some have got “too Much”—With
these opinions however unwillingly I would shock the Sentiveness of
a very limited number of individuals, I cannot admit the right of the
controllers of the Union Bank to contract or expand the currency
at their own Caprice from this time till the year 1868 (when the
last bonds become due) at the expense of the rights the prosperity
the tranquility and the character of the whole people of Florida and
therefore I must recommend equally for the benifit of the Stock-
holders bond holders and the public that speedy means be devised
to secure to the Country every benifit it may have derived from the
establishment of the Bank and secure all parties against further loss
and evil consequences which can be accomplished alone by the appoint-
ment of a Commission of liquidation or of permanent Inspectors and
an entire Change in the Direction of the Bank—

Untill the arrival of M. Gregory at Pensacola the Charter of the
Bank established there which then contained more than the ordinary
good features of Similar Acts was inoperative in Creating a Bank
but by amendments in which the Legislative Council accommodated
provisions precisely to the apparent wishes and resources of that
Gentleman the Bank went into operation and had a capital quite
sufficient for the wants of that small community was paid up the
Bank with regular Management might have been a convenience to
trade and by its circulation excluded paper Money of neighbouring
states less known and more doubtfull but in 1835 a band of those
speculators falsely called Capitilists whose monied influence has been
derived from that incarnation of profligacy the Pensylvania Bank of
the United States cast their eyes upon Pensacola as a favorable
location for land & town lot speculation, a small tract contiguous to
and immediately North of the City was purchased and laid out into
10,000 lots duly defined by Streets marked by cutting away the
Brush Wood and a lithographic Map, But though Nature had done
much for Pensacola she had not prepared employment or subsistence
for an immediate augmentation of the 100,000 Souls that would be
required to populate this Visionary Metropolis and therfore resort
was made to art and Legislation—A Charter was obtained in Alabama
to construct a Rail Road from the Florida line across to opposite to
Columbus in Georgia and permission from the Legislative Council of
Florida to continue it from Alabama to Pensacola–
The Council at the same time in the Spirit of Magnificient Legisla-
tion which distinguished the period increased the Capital of the Bank
to $2,500,000 the Bank was authorised to subscribe Stock in the Rail
road Company and the Territory was pledged to endorse bonds to be
sold abroad to enable the Bank to furnish the Means to construct
the Work, The town lot association subscribed all or nearly the Stock
of the Bank and the Bank subscribed all the Stock of the railroad and
to enable those Wealthy disinterested Capitalists of Philadelphia to
commence their benevolent designs for the improvement of Florida
the Executive endorsed the faith of the Territory upon bonds to the
Amount of about half a Million of dollars which were sold to raise the
Wind—Upon the former Capital of the Bank of ($200,000) 25 p. Cent
had been paid up which Stock was received in the new Subscription
and 5 p. Cent called on $2,500,000 of the $69,1155 p" was paid in cash
and the remainder being in promissory Notes $69,115 is all the Capital
that has ever been up—Nor could it have been deemed necessary by
the scheming protegé's of the Pensylvania United States Bank to
men accustomed to borrowing Money at from three to twelve Months
the New invention of borrowing upon bonds payable a quarter of a

Century hence or the life of a generation was a greater promise of
Wealth than all the Mines of Mexico—The bonds were payable at a
distant the profits of the rail road were to pay for its construction off
hand and the white Sand marked into town lots of 30 feet by 100
were to produce by Sale such countless treasures that really the Com-
pany must have been in a dilemma to decide upon a safe investment
for their prospective Millions—
The Management of the Rail Road Company appears to have been
as Visionary as the ideas of its projectors and its operations commenced
on a Scale commensurate with the future granduer of the New City
of Pensacola rather the necessities of a New Country when an Arti-
ficial road was desireable for interior communication—Head Work
instead of hand work was then the prevailing Spirit. Engineers were
engaged at enormous Salaries to remain in Town not on the road wild
outlays were made for Surveyors Superintendants and other purposes
Various Materials were prematurely purchased and the funds became
exhausted—Vision like they had vanished almost as soon as they were
created—On one side was a debt due the Bank of $592,013 (instal-
ments and advances) on the other 12 Miles of road graded, a Work
which might be done for $40,000 Iron to the Value of $25,000 a pile of
timber useless and rotting a few Carriages and Mountings and an
assortment of noseless picks broken handled shovels and other similar
Valuable appendages to an unfinished work to which may be added
property to the Amount of $95,000 thrown away upon another rail
road—
Not knowing by what authority the Alabama Florida and Georgia
Rail road Company could subscribe stock in the Montgomerie rail
road I call this amount of property transferred “thrown away” by the
former Company because it has dispossessed itself of assets that might
have been converted into ready means for paying its liabilities whereas
now they are beyond their reach and to judge by Ordinary Railroad
profits will produce nothing—Since all is to be recommenced I con-
sider the Alabama Florida and Georgia rail road as defunct to all
intent and purposes—The remaining Materials are of less Value than
the experience gained but since this experience could have been more
cheaply purchased by an examination of reckless borrowing improvi-
dent squandering in Neighbouring States I consider this but a small
extenuation for Wanton mismanagement at Pensacola The Work
itself should be encouraged it is necessary importance for the trans-
portation of the Mails and passengers between the Southwest and
North and since Nature has formed the Bay of Pensacola as the natural
depot of all armaments for the defence of the Mississippi and coast of
the Gulf of Mexico a ready communication from thence to the in-

terior States is indispensible for National defence—But I do not speak
of it as a profitable investment and pay little attention to the estimated
Amount of freights that have been calculated because Rail road
transportation is too expensive for bulky goods—When the idle visions
of the day are passed and the property of indebted planters is no
longer hurried from their control to meet notes drafts and Bills of
Exchange coming daily to Maturity on both sides of the Atlantic the
periodical flood of the Chattachoochie and Alabama rivers will furnish
natural highways to the Ocean as effective as they are economical for
it is to be hoped that the day is not far distant when the produce of the
Crop be the Master of it and instead of being Compelled to hurry it
away with railroad speed to meet the engagement of City Speculators
he may Control its movements until such time as a remunerating price
repays his labor—The condition of the Bank of Pensacola is most
unenviable. Her paid up Capital I have said is only $69,115 her
whole assets or resources estimating personal securities and the rail
road debt at their full Value do not probably much exceed $300,000
while her liabilities or debts including the Bonds sold Amount to
$923,238 leaving a deficiency of $600,000 or at all events a complete
loss of $500,000 equal to an instalment of Twenty p” Cent on the
subscribed Capital and whether the subscribers can or will pay such
an instalment is the only question upon which to establish the Banks
Solvency—Upon the 8781 shares held in Florida I doubt if much would
be paid nor have I great faith in the responsiblity of those paper
Money credit Capitalists Messrs Jandon Robinson Biddle and others
of the Pensacola association but upon them depends the Solvency of
the Bank and I think a final issue should at once be tried by the call
of an instalment agreeable to the terms of the subscription—
With the Bonds for $500,000 or the annual interest due upon them
(which the Bank has scarce any Means of paying) the public being in
no manner bound can have no concern unless the Bank in providing
for Bond holders abroad should be forced to sacrifice the interest of
Bill holders at home—The Bonds were issued by the Bank for the
benefit of a Rail road of which it owned all the Stock and were sold
to the Pensacola association which owned both Bank and rail road
and the avails were returned through the same hands and expended
by or shared among them—The bonds are now supposed to be in
England and whether any further gambling has rolled them round in
another circle or whether they be pledged to raise funds for other
speculations are matters of little moment to the people of Florida-
The eigth Section of the Act for increasing the Capital of the Bank
implies that only two thirds of the avails of bonds sold should be in-
vested in the Railroad while the balance should be directed to Banking

purposes—Accordingly we find only $332,840 stated as “instalments”
paid on Railroad Stock and $259,173 is set down as “advances” to the
Railroad Company. Inasmuch as the Rail road belongs to the Bank
and can pay no debt unless the Bank furnishes the Means this dis-
tinction is more remarkable for it adhereance to the Letter than to
the Spirit of the Law and as an evidence of the rigid Morality of Phila-
delphia financiers I understand that the “Financial Agents” in in-
sisting that these “advances” should be made used the argument
that as all the Banks had suspended specie payments and could not
soon resume there would be no inconvenience in making these heavy
irredeemable loans with paper Money, This insinuation coming
direct from the Pensylvania Bank of the United States is a happy
illustration of the principals of honor and honesty taught by that
monstrious institution to its dependents in the younger States and
should cease as to rejoice that though supported by all the idle vicious
and turbulent both talented and untalented through out the union it
has at length broke down beneath the Weight of its own iniquity—
In loaning so heavily to the rail road Company the Bank has I
should suppose not precisely fulfilled the purposes for which it was
created. Banks are ordinarily created if we are to believe their pro-
jectors to provide for local Wants and relieve local individual distress—
in short to preserve the neighbourhood from ruin dissolution and
perdition, The “Notes discounted” to accommodate people about
Pensacola hardly exceed $50,000—as to pecuniary relief at this time
the inhabitants might as wisely expect it from an Oyster Bank, yet
paper circulation among the Community gives the Bank a Capital of
$200,000 those therefore who upon good security have been refused
accommodation because the Bank by imprudent loans to the railroad
had exhausted all her Capital are perfectly justified in all their
animadversions—
At the same time I should do justice to the Board of Directors
whom no Board of Directors in the Union have taken less care of
themselves and to the cashier one of the most conscienciously honest
of Men without intention of mismanagement they were governed by
the representations of the Members of the Pensacola associations who
were supposed to possess immense means for relieving any embar-
rasment—they were justified in so believing and should the result prove
otherwise blame rests alone on these people for such Wast & for-
merly conceeded pretensions—

mittee and Commissioners who have examined the different Branches
or offices of the Southern Life Insurance and Trust Company would

differ little in anything important from that made by the President
of the Institution in January last in as much as the assets are set
down in the same uncertain form—
The refusal of Mr Field to submit a list of the notes and Bills dis-
counted was contrary to law because in the 16" Section of the Act
ordaining rules and regulations for the Company commonly called
the charter it is provided that a most thorough examination may be
made by a Master appointed by the Court of appeals and by the
amendment of 1838—transferring the same supervisory power to the
Governor of the Territory the period alone is fixed for the statement
to be made but no change is made in the nature of this investigation
and when it is remembered that the great safety of the Stockholder
under the New York bank law is in the provision which compels the
Bank at all times to submit their affairs to the most searching scrutiny
of Inspectors it is reasonable to suppose that the Gentlemen of that
state who subscribed the great portion of the Stock whatever might
have been their confidence in Lot Clark and George Field looked
upon a periodical examination by disinterested persons and a public
exhibition of the affairs of the Company as the greatest safeguard
for the scarcity of their Capital confided to the sagacity and control
of two individuals to be loaned in a distant country among an un-
known people—
This is a matter for themselves to settle but the refusal of both the
Union Bank and Life & Trust Company to exhibit a list of that por-
tion of their assets called notes and Bills discounted cannot but exite
suspicions abroad more detrimental to the interest and credit of the
institutions that the fullest publication nor will public curiosity never
excited be allayed until the Banks make an exhibition of the loans
under these heads more full more detailed and I may add more
scandalous than any Committee would have promulgated to the
World this Year and every document in the Banks been submitted
to their inspection—
Judging from the respectability of the Northern Stockholders of
the Life & Trust Company I should suppose the $500,000 formerly
paid up was actually paid. Though paid in certificates of deposit
these answered to draw drafts upon to pay for imported trinkets and
finery and though the public never saw this Capital brought to the
Country it may have answered as good a purpose as if imported in
Specie and immediately shipped again to pay debts for useless luxuries,
but though the abundance of paper Money “equivalent to Specie”
may in 1836 have enabled these Stockholders to pay up their instal-
ments it by no means follows that some of them may not when specu-

lative troubles increased have subsequently withdrawn their invest-
ments. This however is only a supposition of my own bassed upon
Mr Field's refusal to furnish a list of Notes and Bills discounted in
which he may have been governed rather by “good faith” to his
New York employers than a desire to mantain “Commercial honor”
with his dependant Customers in Apalachicola and the supposition is
further based upon the universal practice of New York and Northern
Bankmaking speculators who in past Years have made a regular
trade of establishing Banks from Maine to Michigan and from Florida
to Canada where they have promptly furnished funds in the outset to
put the Machines in motion and afterwards borrowed back quite an
equal Amount, such Banks may be very convenient for flooding the
Country with “money” but having in reality no means it is hard to
expect that they should accommodate the public with loans of Capi-
tal—There can be no doubt I think that the affairs of the Bank have
been well managed for the Stockholders by Mr Fields and that its
means for meeting engagements are abundant but at the same time
now that the good project of its original creation is overturned and
the true character of Territorial Bonds exposed perhaps an attention
to its movements is necessary especially in maintaining a Salutary
check upon its Circulation such as that brought to bear in S*Augus-
tine during the Year past—M" Fields it appears wrote without
reflection in stating that the Mortgages are taken at half the estimated
value of the property else the property was apprised by very liberal
Gentlemen For instance Lot Clarks land at the Mouth of the
Ocklawaha Mortgaged for $12,500 I have always heard comprises
only 2500 acres which was purchased for $1800.—and cannot have
since increased in Value. If as I suppose the increase of Stock upon
which the replies of M." Fields are so ambiguous, is the Amount
loaned on Mortgages it might as properly have been frankly acknowl-
edged if otherwise we should have been plainly informed how when
and where this Stock was paid-
The behaviour of the Directors at S*Augustine is an Exhibition of
the impotent Malice of very impotent Malicious and very little people,
Being merely the puppets of Clark & Field they having in reality
nothing to communicate shouts in the Words of Cornings knife
grinder have answered “Story God bless you we have none to tell
Sir”–
From M* Field and M. Williams we have learned more about the
Bank than these directors themselves know nor is their anything
wanting to complete the report or which could have been furnished

by the S*Augustine Directors except the names of a few Stockholders
in that quarter owning about 400 Shares and these may be easily
named . All the discounted paper at both S*Augustine and Jackson-
ville Amounted in January to but $104,000 nor can these two officers
be considered anything but little annoyance Shops intended to give
a local consequence to a few individuals and abroad create an impres-
sion that the benefit of the Institution are very generally diffused—
The influence of these Banks over local elections is a pervading
influence over classes easily distinguished but difficult to fix to
individuals—
It is fully known and understood yet nothing is less susceptible of
tangible or positive proof Banks arise or their generation know that
a Majority of their Customers are more gratified for favors expected
than for favors received and that like hounds on a trail they work best
when their stomachs are empty and appetites craving, consequently
trifling accommodations held in prospective as an inducement com-
mand the Services of more partisans than large Sums actually dis-
counted to them—The number of recipients of Bank favor is very
small the number of expectants will be the lettelest Baetithed eh the
sañe side thetigh especially during the present embarrasments very

State Legislature) a few simple Laws then passed would regulate the

fit and teach little children in such books as they thought fit, another
law might permit people to build as many churches as they pleased

SIR, It has been represented to this department by General
Armistead, Commanding the Army in Florida, that at several of the
most important posts in that territory, a set of persons have taken up
their residence, who are distitute of character, and who are in the
habit of selling whiskey and other liquors to the troops, and as far as
conjecture can go, are supplying the Indians with ammunition."
The President directs that you proceed to remove the intruders
agreeably to the provisions of the Act of Congress of March the 3"
1807"—You will in the first instance warn them to depart by a given
day; and if they do not remove within that period, you will then pro-
ceed to execute the above mentioned Act with as little injury to them
as may be compatible with the object to be attained.
You are authorized to make application to General Armistead who
will furnish you with the necessary force to carry these instructions
into effect. JRP

on the subject.” JRP.

Head Quarters Florida Militia,

TALLAHASSEE, 17th July, 1840.
GENERAL ORDER—NO. 11.
The following instructions have been received from His Excellency,
ROBERT RAYMOND REID, Commander-in-Chief of the Florida Militia.
The attention of the Commanding Officers of Brigades, Regiments,
and Volunteer Corps, is earnestly invoked to the strict fulfillment of
the injunctions therein contained. Any direliction of duty on the
part of Officers relative thereto, will meet with prompt and merited
disapprobation.
The Officers commanding the different Regiments will bear in
mind constantly General Order No. 9—by a strict compliance with
which, it is to be hoped that an efficient protection will be afforded
the frontier against the savage foe.
By order of His Excellency, R. R. REID, Commander-in-Chief.
JNO. GRAHAM, Adjt. and Insp. Genl. Fla. Ma.
Executive Department,
TALLAHASSEE, 17th July, 1840.
SIR—General Armistead having determined to remove the greater
part of the Regular Forces to the East of the Suwannee, it is highly
important that the troops in the Territorial service, the Militia of
Middle and West Florida, and the Inhabitants generally, should be
more vigilant than ever, and constantly on the alert, to resist the in-
cursions of the enemy. No doubt the Indians, emboldened by the
departure of such a number of men from the Middle District, will
seek opportunity to attack the settlements, and it is the duty of every
citizen, whether in or out of service, to be prepared, not only to repel
the enemy, but to give a good account of him, should he appear upon
our frontier.
You will direct the Colonel Commanding the Volunteers in service,
to cause an incessant scouting to be kept up, between the posts, and
in the adjacent hammocks and swamps; and you will take measures,
if you have not already done so, for the immediate organization of the
Militia, and if your orders are not promptly obeyed, you will report
the delinquent and refractory, to the end that the laws of the land
may be enforced against them.
To the Militia we look for the protection of our homes and firesides;
but how can they prove instruments of safety, without organization,
discipline and subordination? Our People should not permit them-

selves to be lulled into a false security; it is impossible to tell when or
where Indians may make their appearance; we should be prepared for
them every where, and at all times. It is confidently believed, that
with pickets around houses at all exposed; with citizens well armed at
home, and prepared for defence; with a Militia determined to beat
back and pursue the enemy; with the Volunteers continually in motion
on a line beyond the settlements, we shall be able at least to protect
ourselves, until the more active operations of the fall and winter
months shall commence. Care and activity for a short time, may
prevent the effusion of blood and destruction of property.
You will take care to encourage the formation of Volunteer Com-
panies throughout the Territory. The Executive will have pleasure
in endeavoring to procure for such Companies arms and accoutre-
ments. The Tallahassee Guards, the Independent City Greys, the
Iola Volunteers, and the Centreville Hussars, will hold themselves in
readiness to march wherever and whenever they may be directed, and
the public service may require.
You will facilitate, as much as possible the organization of the
Regiment intended for the U. S. service—the Companies composing
which will be mustered out of the Territorial service; they are to be
received into the U.S. service for the term of three months; each com-
pany will consist of 61 Privates, 1 Captain, 1 1st Lieut., 1 second
Lieut., 4 Sergeants, 4 Corporals, and 2 Musicians.
Men must be offered to the U. S.; Boys will not be received; such
are the instructions from Washington; but at the same time, you will
cause it to be distinctly understood, that the Commander-in-chief has
great reason to be satisfied with the conduct of Boys in Florida, upon
many trying occasions, and is perfectly aware, that they have often
evinced a valor and patriotism worthy the imitation of men.
I am, Sir, very respectfully, yr. ob. st.

Militia, which the Governor of Florida has been called upon to furnish
for the defence of the settlements in that portion of the Territory.
The object of giving General Reid this separate command is to de-
volve the duty and responsibility of defending the settlements of
Middle and West Florida upon the Officers and troops of the Terri-
tory: and at the same time to leave the forces under you, free from
the embarrassment of defending the settlements in their rear.
It is intended that the Militia called out by the Governor of Florida
in conformity with the instructions of the department, shall be mus-
tered into service by an Officer of the Regular Army, and be supplied
entirely by Officers of the Staff of the Army."
The regular forces within the line of territory assigned to the
command of General Reid will be withdrawn, with as little delay as
practicable in order that the whole body of this description of troops
may be concentrated under you and disposable to carry on the more
active operations of the campaign in East Florida.
The department is gratified to learn that the late active operations
of the Troops, of which it avails itself of this occasion to express its
approbation, have been attended with much less suffering to the men
engaged in them, than had been expected from the continuance of Mili-
tary movements during the summer.
Measures have been taken to augment the forces under your com-
mand by the 1" of October next. The Commanding General will
reply to your application respecting the third Regiment of Artillery.”

PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT BY CITIZENS OF
TALLAHASSEE
[NA:SD, Misc. Letters: DS]
Tallahassee FLORIDA August 10 1840
TO MARTIN WAN BUREN President of the United States
SIR. The Constitution of the United States has placed the Govern-
ment of the Territories, entirely under the controle of Congress, and
Congress has established a form of government for the Teritory of
Florida, by which all the civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution
of the United States to the people of the several states are extended
and secured to the people of this Teritory, although they have not the
sacred political privileges.
The Acts of Congress profess to secure to our persons and property
ample protection, but deny us the privilege of electing our own Execu-
tive and Judicial officers. The powers of appointment and removal of
officers and concequently of control and responsibility so far as they
exist, are vested in the President of the United States, and the officers
appointed by him are not responsible to the people of Florida in any
respect—
This state of dependence leaves the people of this Teritory only the
remedy of complaint and remonstrance to the federal Executive, in
case of misconduct in office on the part of the Teritorial functionaries,
and the ultimate right of armed resistance which Nature gives all
people, only when their grievances become too burdensome to be
endured, and their remonstrances are unavailing with the power which
should grant relief
80 The President was notified by the Secretary of State, July 17, 1840, that
Butler's commission expired on June 11 (NA,SD, Lets. for Exec. Appts., 1840,
vol. 1). The above commission was transmitted to Butler, July 25, 1840
(NA, GLO, Lets. to SG, VII), and was acknowledged Sept. 2 (NA, GLO, Lets.
from SG).

Such being our situation we respectfully claim a right to call the
attention of your Excellency to the recent conduct of Robert Ray-
mond Reid Governor of this Teritory, We refer you to the annex’d
documents, and the following statements as evidence of the Nature
of that conduct
It appears that the Governor has in a time of peace and quiet in our
city, when nothing had occured of a more serious Nature than a few
angry words between some few of our citizens in some cause of private
quarrel, without calling upon the civil authority, without issuing or
asking for any civil process, without any attempt by civil means to
sustain the laws, which indeed there had been no attempt to violate,
exercised his military authority and called into the city an armed force,
troops in the pay of the Government of the United States, and subject
to his orders and stationed them about his house taking possession
of the Cannon on the Capitol Square and occupied certain of the
public streets with lines of Musqutry, along which no citizen was
allowed to pass without his leave, on pain of being shot, That he at
the same time sent expresses into various sections of the country, to
certain of our fellow citizens supposed to be attached to his person
and political party, but pursueing their peaceful avocations, not in the
service of the government and not subject to his orders, except to
repel invasion or suppress insurrection, with orders or requests for
them to come armed to the City
That When our Citizens supprised and excited at these unusual
movements, sent three respectable gentlemen to enquire into the
causes and purposes of their operations, they were haughtily received
and told in reply to their enquiry, that he was not answerable for his
conduct to the people of Florida, but to the President of the United
States, from whom he received his appointment, but condescended
to say that his life had been threatened and summarily dismiss'd them
without further reply—That subsequently, on the evening of the 4"
day of August he caused five citizens to be arrested by his armed
soldiers, who were pursueing their way peacefully in the public streets,
and no charge was made against them then and never has been made
since and no other reason is known for it except the will and pleasure
of the Governor, That it was only when our people justly indignant
and alarmed at these invasions of their personal rights, this violation
of the constitution and laws of the land, by the Authority sent to
protect them and peculiarly bound by his office to uphold them, had
solemnly determined in self defence to resist force by force, and were
preparing with becoming forbearance and moderation, before any
innocent blood was shed to send another civil and respectable deputa-
tion of citizens to learn if possible the cause of these outrages and to

require a dismissal of the troops, that they were at last dismiss'd, as we
are informed at the earnest solicitation of some individual citizens But
the deputation appointed by the citizens wishing to be fully informed
of his purpose, deemed it their duty to make the communication
which they had prepared a copy of which is annex’d hereto and dated
August 5" 1840 and addressed by the committee to the Governor
The committee waited on the Governor with this communication
and only received a verbal answer, that the troops had just then been
dismiss'd, and the only reason assigned for his extraordinary conduct,
was, that the Governor had received some anonymous threatning
letters, by which he had been so excited, that his repose was disturbed
for several nights, and no assurance was given against the recurrence of
similar scenes for the future A further communication was promised
in writing but has not yet been received, There have been the grossest
outrages upon the personal and civil rights of our citizens, ever per-
petrated by any Executive officers since the foundation of the republic,
and scarcely a paralell can be found in the arbitrary conduct of the
British Governors in the incipient stages of the Revolution, and con-
duct in the representatives of his British majesty less in violation of
their existing laws and less wanton, met with the ready and indignant
resistance of the people
Our regard for the Governors personal character compells us to
believe that the anonymous letters mentioned must have been a mere
pretext, as the spirit of manhood revolts at the idea that our Gov-
ernor, the commander in chief of our people whilst war is rageing
around us, whose duty it is to protect us from the savages, who has
even now proclamations in the papers, exhorting the people to firm-
ness vigilance and courage in protecting themselves upon the frontiers,
could exhibit such a degree of pusillanimity as to withdraw troops
from those frontiers exposed to a real & terific foe to protect him
in the bosom of a peaceful community from the idle threats of anon-
ymous and childish scribblers, and could permit his sense of propriety
to be so far distorted by his fears as to induce him to arrest peaceable
and innocent citizens at the point of the bayonet—In his behalf and
for ourselves we repel the imputation upon our chief Magistrate,
Common sense would have told him that a lurking assassin could
have perpetrated his fell purpose hitherto, or might hereafter as he
could not always remain fortified in his own house, And that a person
entertaining such intentions would not have warned him against the
blow, And the least enquiry would have informed him, (if his ignorance
of the people he governs was such as to render it necessary) that the
peaceable citizens would have turned out to a man to protect him,
from the violence of a mob, if there had been one for their own sakes

if not for his—Nor can we suppose Governor Reid to have been act-
uated by an idea so stupid as that of establishing a permanent petty
Military despotism in our Teritory, and that in future executive
power was to be manifested and executive will executed by the Sword
and Bayonet, and not as hithertoo by the Moral influence arising
from the knowledge that a few people always stand ready with their
lives to sustain their public functionaries in all lawful and just acts
of power—
We confess with humility and mortification that the only reasonable
& plausible purpose which we can conjecture for his conduct is as
grave and portentious as the two former have been ludicrous and
contemptible, It may not be known to your Excellency, that we
are divided here as every free people must be, into parties, each
struggling to maintain its own opinions, and each doubtless for the
most part equally concientious, and anxious only for the good of our
common country both as to Teritorial affairs and general politics,
Governor Reid is among the leaders of those parties, and has mani-
fested] in all his acts, official as well as private a desire too promote
and sustain his party by every means in his power, Although we
should prefer that our Governor as he is sent to us by the President
and not chosen by ourselves, should as far as possible hold himself
aloof from and above party influence, yet we shall not complain so
long as as it does not lead him to transcend his powers or urge him
into acts of oppression, But it is a remarkable fact, that the very
first attempt at organization, made by the party opposed to the
political views of Governor Reid was made on the third day of August,
as will be seen by a notice of a public meeting herewith enclosed,”
and that same evening the Governors expresses were sent for the
troops which arrived the next Morning, this coupled with the fact,
that expresses were sent to the country, at the same time calling in
citizens of his party (who we are happy to say had too much good
sense & patriotism to come) seem to establish a connection more than
accidental, between the two occurrences and to stamp that connection
with a political character, And we are led irrisistably to the conclusion
that it was his design to overaw and put down by a timely exhibition
of force & power the first germs of an opposition likely to be formi-
dable for the first time, because for the first time organised, with the
hope that by this interference with peaceble citizens in the exercise
of their rights and duties the timid, wavering and doubtful, might
be deter'ed from opposing his measures and that a large class of
ordely & peaceble men who prefer to endure the evils of all most

any government, to the Anarchy confusion and blood shed of civil
war, might remain quiescent in preference to joining or establishing
any party the existence of which might by possibility lead to dis-
asterous concequences-
If such was his purpose we submit it to your excellency to say
whether it was becoming in a Democratic Governor, we are fully
satisfied the people of no state in the union nor of the United States
would tolerate it for a moment in their respective chief magistrates,
we have no power and can only represent our grievances to the con-
cideration of the Federal Executive, But what ever may have been
the purposes of Governor Reid (for as he has not thought proper to
explain, as yet we are left to conjecture) his conduct would have
inevitably led, had not better counsels prevailed with him at the last
moment, to most fatal results and we pray heaven in its mercy to
avert a similar crisis from occuring in our country again, as we are
well satisfied that not only the sanctity of the governors person would
be in danger of being violated thereby, but the lives of valuable citizens
be put in jeopardy—In conclusion we assure your Excellency that our
citizens, generally entertain no personal hostility to Governor Reid
and if confined to his legitimate powers, his political feelings would be
a matter of utter indifference to us as that of such a functionary could
possibly be—We heard at the time of his appointment that he was
selected as a civilian, whos duty would be to be peaceful himself, but
to cooperate with the Army, as far as the Enemy is concerned he is
certainly peaceful as could be desired, but his civil knowledge has not
taught him respect for civil rights, Towards the people he assumes a
belligerent atitude, employing the troops in paradeing around his
house and through the streets to the terror of the peaceful citizens
misapplying the time of the military and squandering the means of
the Governor not for the defence of the citizens, but for purposes of
misrule and oppression
We therefore submit the facts to your Excellency as the only
authority which he reccognises, and the only one before which we
can civily lay our grievances, We respectfully request that we may
be informed in such manner and time as may suit the convenience of
your Excellency, whether the conduct of Governor Reid upon this
occasion meets with the censure or approval of the chief Executive
Magistrate of our Republic,

tory of Florida
SIR. As a committee on part of the citizens of Tallahassee we lay
before your Excellency the affidavits of Levi Carlton, T. Bezeau,
David F. Wilson Lewis H. Bryant, Waller W. Taylor and Charles
Quayle,” all of whom are citizens of Tallahassee but one, who resides
in the county of Madison. These depositions prove that an armed
force now in the service of the United States have been called to
Tallahassee and as you avow by your order “to maintain the supremacy
of the laws” The Citizens of this place have met to enquire into the
causes that have induced your Excellency to call into our city a
military force (that had been provided for the defence of citizens on
the frontier) and after due examination we have not been able to hear
of any disorder or violation of the peace, except some angry words

enforced and we will give to every individual citizen protection and
security. If your Excellency knows of any instance in which re-

Judge or Magistrate of the city or county, the citizens have not been
apprised of it, nor have they been called on to sustain the civil author-

of the Federal Constitution when any Executive called in a military
force to preserve the peace and order of a community where no actual
violence has been comitted, and even when violence has occurred the
military arm is never resorted to until the civil authority has been
called upon and after trial found ineffectual

We consider the introduction of an armed force under your orders
into our city as a violation of the Constitution of the United States,
subversive of the liberty of our citizens and calculated to degrade
our character as orderly citizens at home and abroad. Your Excel-
lency has been pleased to state in your letter of 4" inst * “that the
public peace was yesterday in repeated instances violated” We
presume your Excellency has not made this statement on your own
knowledge but on such information as you have received. We call
for proof of these repeated instances of violated laws which are charged
to have occurred here on 3” inst. We assure your Excellency you
have been imposed on by the fears of some timid persons or some
whose malice or desire is only to traduce our fellow citizens, Except
some hasty and passionate words that on the 3" inst passed between
some of our citizens we know of nothing else that could have brought
an armed force into our city. We know of no attempt at violence
on the part of any of our citizens but your own officer Major Elias
E. Blackburn on this day August 5" attempted by showing his
bowie knife and by insulting and menacing manner and language
to intimidate our citizens,
If our peaceable citizens are to be arrested by the soldiers under
your orders in the streets while pursuing their ordinary business or
seeking social intercourse with each other, if they are to be threatened
by armed sentinels if they do not stop, if our citizens are like criminals
to be conducted before the officer of your guard before they are
permitted to go about their own business, If they are not permitted
to see you and learn the cause of their arrest, we are indeed under a
military despotism unknown hitherto in the United States, Sir.
we protest on the part of our citizens against this exercise of military
force over them, We claim all the rights of citizenship and these
rights our duty as freemen will compel us to maintain and defend
from all insult and violence come from what quarter it may, You
sir, are as safe in this city as you would be in Washington under the
immediate protection of the President of the United States and we
pledge ourselves that yourself and family and friends require not
protection from the military force under your command from any
other enemy but the savage foe of our country—Entertaining these
opinions and confident they are those of our fellow citizens we respect-
fully request that the military now in this city may be sent to the
frontier to protect our fellow citizens who are in actual danger and
where their services are necessary—This course we hope you will

U.S. Sch’ Flirt KEY BISCAYANO, August 11’ 1840
SIR; Capt Housman the Proprietor of Indian Key, having called
upon me for a Garrison for the Island, I entered into arrangements
with him for the cession of the whole Key to the United States,
except a small portion of it, for his Store and dwelling. This arrange-
ment cedes the Key to the United States, for a Military Post, during
the continuance of the Florida War, or for so long as the United
States may think proper to hold it for that purpose, during the
continuance of the war.
The Key being thus placed under Military control exclusively, I
have ordered the removal of my Hospital and depot from Tea Table
Key thereto. Abundance of water, with good wharves and storage
in three outhouses, which escaped the flames, have been the induce-
ment to make this transfer, whilst at the same time it saves me the
necessity of further dividing my small force to furnish another garrison
for this place.
I have the honor to enclose you a copy of the arrangement entered
into, with Capt Housman.”

U.S. Sch’ Flirt KEY BISCAYNo August 11th 1840
SIR, I regret to inform you that whilst at Anchor here on the
morning of the 8" inst, an express reached me from Mid" F. K.
Murray, bearing a letter, of which the enclosed is a copy,” advising
me of the capture of Indian Key by the Indians—
The wind and tide being both adverse, and the channel way very
narrow & intricate, I immediately transferred all the Marines and
crew of this Wessel, but such as were required to navigate her, to the
Otsego, and started for Tea Table Key, where we arrived during the
night, —leaving this Wessel to follow at the change of tide. On our
arrival there, we found that the Indians, who proved to be the
Spanish Indians, having loaded their boats with supplies of every
description from the Store of Mr Houseman the proprietor of the Key,
had destroyed the town by fire, and retired without molesting our
hospital & depot at Tea Table Key, distant but one mile, for which
the most serious apprehensions were entertained—Mid: Murray had
however made every preparation for its defence, which his limited
means would allow—
That the Indians were conducted to this attack by some person or
persons acquainted with the localities of the Key, cannot be doubted—
Their landing was effected on the outerside of the Key, at a point the
most remote from their approach, yet at a corner of the town unin-
habited, whilst every consideration, if ignorant of this fact, would
have induced them to have landed at a point directly opposite,
Landing where they did their retreat was liable to be cut off, and but
for the loss of his guns, there is every reason to believe M. Murray
would have effected this in the destruction of their canoes:—Whilst
by landing at the opposite point of the Key, their retreat could have
been securely effected on the approach of any danger, Again, Negroes
were seen among them, who, with others were heard to speak English,
& these last, not in the dialect of the Negro; this information is
gathered from the sufferers by the Attack. Lieut: Comdt: Rodgers

in the Wave had left there but the day before for Cape Romano,
carrying with him from Tea Table Key every man capable of doing
service but five. That his departure was communicated to, or looked
for by the Indians there cannot be a doubt. In the presence of his
force, their invariable policy forbids the belief that they would have
ventured upon the attack—
In so serious a disaster, where so great a loss of life was to be looked
for, it is gratifying to know that it was small. D* Perrine, Mr Motte,
his wife and two young children, and a lad named Turdy, were killed,—
the latter drowned in a cistern in which he had concealed himself—
Mr Otis was wounded, and the missing are a negro woman with her
two children belonging to M.” Howe, and a negro child belonging to
Mr Houseman—These were carried off by the Indians—They retired
at 2 PM. of the 6" ulto. in thirty four boats, six of which had been
taken from the Key. In some of the boats six, seven, & eight people
were counted, in none less than four, so that their number could not
have been short of one hundred thirty four people—
Those who escaped from the Key found refuge in the Sch' Medium
then lying in the harbour. Every convenience and comfort which it
was in the power of the Officers of this Expedition to furnish them in
their destitute condition has been extended to them. I have also
furnished them such supplies from the public stores as were necessary—
The Widow & family of Dr Perrine have taken shelter in this Wessel,
awaiting transportation to the North—"

For the reasons assigned in my late communication to you” on the
subject of the expenditure of the appropriation for clerk hire in your
office, to wit, a possible deficiency in the public revenue to meet the
expenditures appropriated for at the late session of Congress, which
renderes it necessary that all the disbursements should be restricted
to the least possible amount consistent with the public interest, and
in view of the fact that a very large body of new lands has been put
into market this year and is now subject to private entry, and that
owing to the delay of the passage of the general appropriation laws
until the close of the late session of Congress, more than six months
have elapsed of the year, for the Service of which, your estimates,
were originally made, it is deemed advisable to limit your contracts
for the present surveying season, to the $2,000 general appropriation
at $4 a mile, and $4,000 of the special appropriation of $10,000 of
surveys at a price not exceeding $5 a mile, making together $6,000,
or one half the aggregate of the appropriations for new surveys in
your district reserving the balance for future instructions or to be
carried forward and taken into the account of the estimates for the
service of 1841.—In making contracts for the above surveys, the

embraced in any one contract, and the time allowed for its completion,
and you will as heretofore render separate quarterly accounts and
vouchers for your disbursements under the Special appropriations
for Surveys at augmented prices—
Should the Indian hostilities on account of which your late estimate
of $20,000 for surveying at regular prices was not submitted to

Head Qrs: Army of Florida CEDAR KEYS 17* August 1840.
SIR I have recently had an interview with his Excellency the
Governor of Florida, and Brig. Gen Read of the Militia. Both of
these gentlemen concur in opinion that it will be extremely difficult
to get any volunteers to serve as footmen, and in my opinion there
is no probability of raising this force, as three months have already
elapsed since the authority was given to organize such a force, and
not a man has come forward.
To remedy this evil, it is proposed to protect the Settlements by
employing the men in the neighbourhood, giving them soldier's pay,
with out rations. Thereby a body will be formed sufficiently strong
for the purposes of immediate defence at a small expense, while the
mounted force will be left free to carry on operations at a distance
from the settlements.
These views are submitted with a hope that you may order the
attempt to be made as being the only mode left to create a force of
dismounted men in Florida.
I have the honor to report for the information of the dep’t, that a
portion of Captain Beall's command stationed near this place at Fort
N° 4, is scouring the country South to the Withlacoochee, while a
detachment of the 1* Infantry from this post and Fort Fanning has
proceeded to Fort White, in pursuit of Indians believed to be in that

SIR, I respectfully acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the
30" ulto," enclosing a statement of officers who left Florida by
authority of General Taylor, -of the 31" Ult.” relative to selecting
a proper officer for mustering the Militia, and of the 3" inst.” relative
to furnishing an escort to the Marshall of the Eastern district in
taking the census.”
Nearly all the Militia force has been mustered into service by Major
Churchill, tho' his health for some time past has been very feeble.
The mounted men compose thirteen companies, which under the
organization of May 1792,” makes an aggregate of 1001 men exclusive
of field & staff. It is much to be doubted whether any volunteer
footmen can be raised.
While on the subject of the Militia, I would remark that although
a Brigadier General has been appointed and mustered into service,
yet no instructions have been received to organize a Brigade, nor will
it I fear be possible to raise men enough for the purpose unless they
can all be mounted. The Militia force mustered into Service, agree-
ably to instructions from the War Dept; and Head Qrs. of the Army,
now present the anomalous organization of one Brig. Gen', one
Colonel—one Lt. Colonel, one Major and 13 Companies."
Measures have been taken to furnish the Marshall of the Eastern
district with a sufficient escort in the performance of his duty in taking
the census.
I enclose a communication from L' Col. Riley" relative to the
disposition to be made of the late Ordnance Sergeant at Fort King,
who has by sentence of a garrison Court Martial been reduced to the
rank of a private sentinel, and respectfully request the decision of the

SIR I enclose herewith statements of six cases which were decided
against the United States at the last session of our court viz
John W. Lowe & others 16.000 acres
Heirs of Clarke & Atkinson 15.000 “
John Breward 16.000 “
Domingo Acosta 8.000 “
Heirs of G. J. F. Clarke 1.000 “
Heirs of Delia Broadaway 500 “
In the first four cases, as the law requiring them to be carried to the
Supreme Court is imperative I have in accordance with a practice
which I adopted at an early period in these land cases in order to
facilitate sending them up on appeal this course although not accord-
ing to the literal interpretation of the act (which seems to require the
Dictrict Attorney first to make his statement and then wait the Fiat
of the Attorney General (see sec. 9. of the act of 23* May 1828, Land
Laws part 1" page 438, has been tasitly approved by your predecessor
& no evil has risen from it so far as I am advised; No new principle
was adjudicated upon in any of the cases, every question presented
in them it is believed has been fully settled by the cases referred in
these statements & by other cases before decided by the Supreme
Court.
In the case of Pedro Mirando & others on a claim for 368.400 acres
the counsel for the claimants after the verdict of the jury in their
favour on the issue at law proposed to us to permit them to take a
decree Pro Forma for 46.080 acres the quantity of land to which they
were entitled, if the grant is genuine reserving to each party the right
of appeal—to which for the purpose of saving time; I assented on con-
dition that the costs shall abide the decision of the Supreme Court;

and a decree was entered accordingly from which both parties ap-
pealed. This is a very important case & I shall endeavor to send you
a full statement of it together with notes as full as may be in my power
of the arguments & authorities which had been prepared by the re-
spective counsel; upon the only question remaining in this case after
the verdict viz The proper rendering into English of the Spanish words
“Ocho Leaguas En Quadro” the counsel for the claimants as a further
condition to my assent to the above proposition agreed to furnish me
with a note of the point which he had intended to make and of the
authorities which he had prepared to adduce had that question been
argued here. I sent you sometime since, a copy of the records of the
feigned issue, & some rough notes of the arguments presented, upon
the trial of it.
Two claims were rejected viz
The Heirs of Rodrigues 30.000 Acres
& The Heirs of Charles W. Clark 16.000 “
Five were argued and submitted and are under advisement viz
John M Hanson & others 16.000 Acres
3 cases Heirs of G. J. F. Clarke 2000 each 6.000 “
& The Heirs of E Wiggins .300 “
The court has adjourned over to the 3" Monday in November when it is
believed they will be decided, and as also the following 5 cases “Wiz”
John Sanchez 4.00 Acres
Francis R. Sanchez 5.00 “
Joe G. Sanchez 4.00 “
F. J. Ross & others 8.00 “
John Houston 7.00 “
I was ready in all the other cases several of them, however had to be
continued on account of the death of parties & four of the most im-
portant of them, “Viz”
Nicoll Trumbull & others 57.300 Acres
Heirs of Joseph M Arredondo 40.000 “
Heirs of F.M. Arredondo 50.000 “
& Heirs of F.M. Arredondo & M. E. Levy 256.000 “
were continued on motion of the claimant's counsel, sustained by
affidavits shewing cause, the principal ground of which was the absence
of D. Levy Esq one of the Counsel for the claimants in whose posses-
sion the papers of the claimants had been so that these cases could
not be prepared for argument at this term—I also send you a work in
Spanish on the subject of surveying in the Island of Cuba, which may
throw some light on the Miranda case, In several of these mill grants
as in those of Brevard & Lowe & others the term is “Cinco Millas en
quadro” which has always here been translated, five miles square
making 16.000 acres & in these cases as well as several others the

grantee's in their petitions to the Governor go on to ask specific quanti-
ties of Land at places which they point out, making in whole 16.000
acres which are granted shewing that the Governor put that construc-
tion upon these words. Hence the reason why I have not raised the
same question in these cases that I did, in the Miranda case, all the
mill grants of this description were offered in evidence, by the claim-
ants in the Miranda case, there is however this distinction between
them, mile was never used even in the grants to signify any thing but
lineal measure, until long after the date of the Miranda grant while
league had been used in Cuba time out of mind for superficial measure
and a league of land was a term in as common & familiar use there as
acre is with us, I think this book, as well as the testimony of Mr.
Trist & the other witnesses in Cuba shew this conclusively, this Prov-
ince was attached to the Captaincy General of that Island, at the date
of the Miranda grant & there was very frequent intercourse between
this city & that Island as it was very natural there should be and the
term league of Land was doubtless well known & understood here as
used in Cuba at that time.

SIR, I have the honor to inform you that the inhabitants of Key

town. A copy of their letter, with my reply thereto, I have the honor
to enclose.”
The high excitement caused by the late disaster at Indian Key,
and the apprehensions entertained by the residents here, are the only
justification I can offer, for having appropriated the force of this ex-
peditions to purposes, wherein it was not contemplated that it should
be employed. It certainly was never the intention of the Depart-
ment, to establish garrisons in the towns on this reef with the Seamen
and Marines of this expedition; yet in the absence of a Military force,
I have yielded to the requisition of the inhabitants, in the hope that
the presence of a regular force, may soon allay their apprehensions and

regain them a confidence in their resources and power of self-defence.
The people of Key West appear to expect protection from the
Government exclusively, whilst they take no measures for their own
self preservation. With a population exceeding five hundred, they
are content to sit down under the protection of twenty, or thirty
seamen. This is a manner of defence I am not willing to permit.
For the present however, I have granted them a guard of this number,
the unhealthy and stormy season having arrived, which precludes the
possibility of any further active operations until November. At
that time unless I shall be otherwise instructed in the interim, I shall
withdraw these garrisons and return the force to the duties assigned
it in the General Instructions I had the honor to receive from you.

ST: AUGUSTINE E Fl" 22" Aug 1840
SIR, On arriving at this place the day before yesterday, the mel-
ancholy news reached me of the capture & destruction of Indian Key
by the Indians. Among the Inhabitants murdered was the estimable
and scientific Doctor Perrine.
As the Indians were accompanied by Several white persons (Such
are the Reports which have reached me) and have possessed them-
selves of a quanity of Gun-powder and Lead from Cap" Housmans
ware-houses—it is not improbable they will make attempts upon
Key Waccas or Key West in South & upon Micanopie—Newnans-
ville—Black Creek or even St. Augustine in East Florida. It is
important that these places Should be well defended.
I shall immediately offer rewards for the apprehension of all whites
& blacks holding intercourse with, or aiding the Indians" & will en-
dearor to cause the patrol Laws and a Strict police in the Towns &
Cities, to be enforced.
Such is the deplorable condition of East Florida that I have been
obliged to call into the Territorial Service, on this Side the Suwanee,
as many as Six Companies & I may be compelled to raise the Seventh.
* The proclamation, dated Aug. 24, 1840, is printed in The Floridian, Talla-
hassee, Sept. 12, 1840. A reward of $200 was offered for the apprehension of both
white persons and negroes found aiding the enemy.

I have received them on the condition, that they forage & Subsist
themselves until they are discharged or received into the Service of
the U. States. These Seven companies will make up the Five hun-
dred now wanting, to complete the 1500 men, you required me to
raise for Gen' Reads command. They are Horsemen & I hope you
will order them to be taken into Service. Footmen cannot be
procured. -
But I must be permitted to Say, that 1500 men are not a sufficient
force for the Military district commanded by Gen' Read—it is a very
large one, infested with Indians in every direction, & if the force be not
increased to 3000 horsemen—disasters & defeat may be expected."
I am not in possession of your views respecting the numbers &
operations of the Regular Army; but it is my duty to ask, in behalf of
our Suffering people, that the first may be as great as possible & that
both Regulars & Volunteers be kept constantly in action. Perhaps,
if the Army had been in full pursuit of the Indians, the disasters at
Indian Key would not have occurred.
There should be a competent naval force upon the Coast to Second
the efforts of the Army on Shore & to intercept the fishermen who are
trading with the Indians & providing them with ammunition. Small
Steam boats & armed vessels of light draught are best Suited to
Such a Service.
I am afraid you will not find the plan adopted for the prosecution
of the War, as efficacious as you expect it to be—but to make it as
much So as possible, allow me to Say, the Surgical & Quarter Masters
Departments for the volunteers Service Should be filled from the
Citizens & not from the Regular Army. I know there are objections
to this; but they will be more than compensated by the embarrass-
ments which will be avoided.
I repeat the assurance heretofore given, that every thing shall be
done on my part that can be, to give the fullest & most prosperous
effect to your measures.
I wrote you Some time Since respecting the Accounts of the Terri-
tory for moneys expended and for debts contracted for the military
Service during the present & past years.” The accounts for middle
Florida are made out & in a State of readiness as those for the East
will soon be ready for examination.
If two Officers could be appointed—one for the Eastern & the other
for the Middle districts, to settle & pay off these demands—I should
be very much relieved & gratified.

The account for the dogs from Cuba remains yet unpaid—allow me
to ask your attention to it.
I received yesterday a proposition from a Citizen of Black Creek
M" Murphy—which Should it Succeed, will afford an example worthy
to be followed. He proposes to go with a company of footmen to
Fowl Town 8 miles in advance of Fort King, to clear & cultivate the
country & at the Same time protect themselves against the Indians—
he will, as an inducement to his men, pay from his own pocket, the
difference between the Infantry & dragoons pay—but he asks for Six
or eight Horses & forage for them. If it be in your power to author-
ize Such enterprizes, I should be glad to have your permission to
encourage them. Be pleased to give a Special Order for allowing the
Horses, above mentioned to M' Murphy & for forage for them.
The Situation of affairs in Florida is worse than it has ever been;
& the most vigorous & active measures are required at the present
juncture. I am heart Sick at the prospect before us. There were
150 Indians at Indian Key—150 are at this moment in the Okefanokee
Swamp or upon its borders—There are besides Several hundred War-
riors who do not belong to these parties—many of them in Middle
Florida & many South of the Suwanee. We underrate the numbers
of the Enemy & there is no Safety in Florida. If these troubles exist
for Six months longer, many of our most valuable Inhabitants will
leave the country in despair—

[NA:SD, Misc. Lets.:LS]
WASHINGTON August 28*1840
SIR, It is with much reluctance that I address you in reference to
the conduct of Govn Reid, of Florida—The whole case having been
presented to your consideration by a very able committee of the
citizens of Tallahassee,” I should have remained silent; but, from
some remarks which appeared in the “Globe” of yesterday, I am
apprehensive, that an attempt has been made to give a different
colouring to the matter, and to support Govn Reid in his lawless
violation of the constitution, and rights of our citizens—
Govn Reid, I know not by what authority, certainly by no law,
has a body of militia under his control, mustered into the service of
* Ante, p. 186.


## p. 207 (#219) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 207
the United States, and receiving pay and subsistence from the General
Government—This corps, as I am informed, is composed mostly of
discharged soldiers of the regular army—All the officers of this corps
are appointed by the Govn" in despite of the laws of Florida, which
prescribe that “officers of the militia shall be elected by their seperate
command”—It has been publicly charged in the newspapers in
Florida, that these appointments are all made with reference to
politics, and that no man can get a commission, unless his democracy
is orthodox—unless he declares himself a friend, both to your adminis-
tration and to that of Govn Reid—As this rule disqualifies the best
materiel of Florida—excludes our best citizens and most skilful Indian
fighters, it follows that his officers are sometimes badly selected,
although they are always devoted to himself—In this state of things
with a soldiery having no community of feeling and interest with the
citizens, and officered only by the Governor's partizans, you will at
once see the danger to the peace of the Territory in bringing against
the people a corps like this, for no other reason than a private quarrel
in the street between two individuals, and because one of them, the
Governor's friend, thought he would be safer with a portion of the
Army to defend him—This, Sir, as I am assured by the most respect-
able authority, was the only excitement at Tallahassee before the
introduction of the military—The reasons given by the Govn" for their
introduction are not the true ones—You know it is the fashion for the
dominant party to make the banks, godfathers to every offence—and
so it is in this case—But, I assure you Sir, the banks had no more to
do with this quarrel, than the ghost of Banquo—Nor would any but
the most fertile or frightened fancy attribute it to their agency—
True there are many of the best citizens of Florida friendly to her
banks, who do not consider them swindling shops—nor their directors
rogues—nor those who support them, British bought aristocrats, and
who will not suffer themselves to be called “Abolitionists” or the
allies of “Abolitionists,” merely because they would prefer a different
set of rulers—
The reasons given by the Govn himself seem to me exceedingly
puerile, and are certainly insufficient to justify him, in calling the
army intrusted to him for the defence of the frontier, from their posts
of utility, and placing them in battle array against the citizens-
“Mr Francis was assaulted”—“M” Anderson threatened”—“M”
Brown treated with indignity insult.” And for this the frontier is
left defenceless and Florida placed on the brink of a civil War—I ask
you Sir, if we have not war enough in that afflicted Territory, without
bringing the army of the United States or the militia in their service,


## p. 208 (#220) ############################################

208 T E R R IT OR I. A L PA P E R S.
against us—If the Govn" is so unpopular as to require an army to
defend him, so timid as to think it necessary, so careful of his own
safety as to leave the frontier unprotected and the lives of those
entrusted to his care at the mercy of the savage—because—“M”
Francis was assaulted”—“M” Anderson threatened”—“M” Brown
treated with indignity and insult”, and he himself frightened, I ask
you, Sir, if he is the proper Governor for the Territory of Florida, at
such a time as this—of war and of massacre?—And Sir, I beg leave
to inform you—that all these enormities complained of by the Govn"
were committed by one single individual! Yes Sir, the same one
man—“assaulted Francis—threatened Anderson—insulted Brown”—
and alarmed the Governor—The other reason given by the Govn" is an
after thought—He was heard to say, after the soldiers were sent away,
that he had never heard before of an intention to pull down the
printing office—In a word M. President, as has already been said,
you have “placed an unwelcome ruler over an unwilling people”—
one totally unfit for the duties that are now his—either of War or of
peace–And I assure you Sir, that I believe my friends, in assigning to
you the reasons for the conduct of the Govn have not given due
weight to his habits—And if he is continued in office, which I would
deeply lament, what has poor Florida to expect—from a civil and
military ruler unpopular enough to be in personal danger from popular
odium—timid enough to apprehend it—reckless enough to place
armed soldiery around his house—selfish and unfeeling enough to rob
the women and children, on the frontier of the defences provided
them—to protect himself against danger, the idea of which, could
originate only in a highly excited imagination?—
I beg you Sir, to excuse me for addressing you on the subject of
Florida appointments, as I have long since proved it useless—But I
feel it my duty to unite my feeble voice with those who complain of
the conduct of Govn Reid, and to ask you if his profession of attach-
ment to yourself and of hostility to the banks are sufficient, in your
estimation, to palliate or justify his conduct?
I have the honour to be Very respectfully Your obdt. Servant.

relative to the location of the grant of ten acres of land to the Talla-

Congress approved March 3" 1835" (Pamph. laws 2nd sess. 23"
Cong. page 48)
In answer to the Surveyor General's letter of the 13th Feby last "
asking for a copy of the original map and instructions, and requesting
the decision of the Department (or attorney General of the U.S.)
whether under the 3rd section of the Act granting the ten acres “At
the junction of St. Mark's & Waculla rivers the point where the roads
terminates” &c shall be laid down on the plats of his office as a valid
grant “when the road has been carried beyond that point to a scite
of a town laid out by the company,” A copy of the original Map
herewith enclosed,” on the face of which will be found the approval
of the location by the President on the 25th June 1835, and of the
commissioner's letter of the 3rd July 1835* (copy enclosed Marked
A) were sent with my letter of the 9th March 1840 * (copy enclosed
marked B) communicating the opinion of this office that the Presi-
dent having acted once, by approving the location on the 25th June
1835, it would not be competent for him to change the location with-
out further legislation of Congress, and requiring him to adhere to
the original instructions of 3rd July 1835. In his letter of the 21st
March last," the Surveyor General requests that his former question
may be yet submitted for the decision of the Attorney General, and
although I can see no reason for changing the opinion already ex-
pressed, very important interests being involved, I would respect-
fully recommend that his opinion may be taken on the point at issue.
I also enclose a copy of the acting Secretary of War's letter of the
29th June 1835" (Marked C) with which the approved plat was
transmitted to this office, there being no copies of the correspondence

SIR, The Adjutant General has laid before me your letter to him
of the 21" ulto.," informing him of your having pushed forward all
your disposable force for the protection of the inhabitants in the
vicinity of the outrages recently perpetrated by the Indians near
the Suwannee and the Georgia frontier. This Act fully meets the
approbation of the Department, and until the General Commanding
in Florida can take the necessary measures of protection, and for
the expulsion of the Indians, you will continue to use every exertion
in your power to accomplish those objects.
The Governor of Georgia has informed the Department that he
has called out two companies of Militia, from Gen Hilliards brigade,
for the protection of the Citizens in the neighborhood of the outrages.
These companies you will promptly cause to be mustered into the
service of the United States, and have them furnished with the neces-
sary supplies of subsistence.”

will be pleased to call out two hundred men, to be mounted and to

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 22" ultimo,” and regret to find in it a confirmation of the suc-
cessful attempt of the Indians again to disturb the settlements in
Middle Florida.
I am equally sensible with yourself of the great importance of some
military organization of the people living within the infested districts
and think it may be rendered effectual in the manner you propose.
The five hundred Infantry you are authorised to raise may be distrib-
uted among the settlements, and constitute the neighborhood force.
It is only necessary that they should be mustered into the service,
which may be done at the place appointed for their rendezvous and
then be kept to guard their own hearthstones in the manner sug-
gested by you.
I am sorry it is not in my power to accede altogether to your wishes
respecting the increase of your mounted force or the extension of their
term of service—You are aware that the means at the disposal of
the Department for the conduct of the Florida war are very limited
and all the calculations of the several Bureaux, charged with the ad-
ministration of the Military service, were based upon the force as-
signed to your command, which, at the time, you considered would

be sufficient to defend the settlements and prevent the Indians re-
turning to Middle Florida when pressed by the operations of the
regular troops in the Eastern and lower parts of the Territory”—
The sudden incursions of the savages into Georgia and the necessity
of raising a force to protect the frontier of that state, and which has
been called out by the Governor, will increase the number of mounted
men in the service, at this time, to an inconvenient extent. Desirous,
however, of providing you with efficient means for your active opera-
tions I have determined to authorise the Governor to add to your
Brigade two hundred mounted men, which will give you an effective
command of twelve hundred mounted men.” Whenever these men
can be usefully employed on foot you are authorised to place their
horses in safe pastures until wanted for service: by which means a
sufficient number of men may be kept in active operations in the field,
while the horses of those who remain in garrisons may berecruiting and
kept ready to succeed the worn out horses of the scouting parties—In
this manner the service may be better performed, and the horses kept
in good order at less expense to government—With regard to increasing
the term of service, I acknowledge its expediency, but have no power
to do it—I am aware with yourself that the laws for governing the
Militia do not apply to Volunteers: but there is no authority of law
for accepting a Volunteer force at all: nor can I authorise the raising
a Volunteer force by the Legislature of the Territory of Florida.
Whatever measures the territorial Government may think proper to
adopt in the existing emergency would in all probability be sanctioned
by Congress; but the Executive cannot receive troops into the service
in any other manner than the law allows.” I regret that my earnest
recommendations to Congress were not acted upon during the last
session and assure you I shall lose no time in reiterating them when
Congress next reassembles.

HIS EXC, ROBERT RAYMOND REID. Governor of Florida. St Au-
gustine, Florida.
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Excel-
lency's letter of 22" ultimo,” from S*Augustine. I had before been
informed of the successful attack made by the Indians upon Indian
Key and of the plunder and destruction of that once flourishing
settlement. I had hoped that the cruizers kept upon that coast, at
my request, by the Navy Department would have afforded ample
protection to the settlements on the Islands, and am grieved to find
that these precautions have been unavailing and the Indians been
permitted to cross a broad channel of the sea, destroy a flourishing
settlement on one of the Keys, and acquire fresh supplies of powder
and other munitions of War by plundering the houses and stores; and
after accomplishing all this to return to the mainland in safety. It is
in vain for the Departments at Washington to provide the means
of defence, if the utmost vigilance is not exercised by the Officers who
are opposed to so active and enterprising an enemy. I have brought
the subject to the notice of the Navy Department and recommended
that the Commander of the West India Squadron be instructed to
afford immediate protection to Key West and at the same time sug-
gested the expediency of a boat expedition to search for and destroy
the means of transportation collected by the Indians and supposed
to be concealed within some of the Inlets.
I cordially agree with you that every effort ought to be made to
discover and bring to justice the white men who are reported to have
accompanied the Indians on their late marauding expedition; although
it appears almost incredible that any white men should be so depraved
as to aid the Indians in the commission of their savage barbarities.
The troops your Excellency has thought it expedient to call out upon
this emergency will be mustered into the service and such portion
of them as exceeds the number assigned to the command of Gen.'
Read by the last order to that Officer, a copy of which has been

transmitted to you, will be discharged. In the absence of all legis-
lative provision, the Department does not feel justified in augmenting
the Militia force beyond that amount. It is hoped that under so
efficient a Commander as General Read, this force will, with the
cooperation of the regular troops, prove sufficient for the protection
of the district assigned to his command.
I regret to find that your Excellency apprehends the plan adopted
by the Department for the prosecution of the war will not prove as
efficacious as I had expected; especially as it was intended that it
should conform in all its essential particulars to your recommendations.
It is now too late to change it, even if a change were desirable. The
reasons for employing Officers of the regular Staff to supply the
troops are so cogent that the regulation cannot be dispensed with;
but there is no objection to the employment of Citizens as Surgeons
and Assistant Surgeons, whenever the services of Medical Officers
are required, on the same terms and in such numbers as is provided
for, by the regulations of the regular service. I have, as you request,
directed the Quarter Master General to appoint two Officers, one in
East and one in Middle Florida to examine the accounts for expenses
incurred in the Military service there.
You may rely upon the utmost exertions being made by the War
Department to strengthen the force in East Florida—Two entire
and fresh Regiments have been, already, ordered there and such other
reinforcements are contemplated as will ensure continued and vigorous
operations during the next campaign. The Navy Department will,
it is presumed, furnish a sufficient number of vessels to cut off such
communication as you apprehend to exist along the coast of Florida.

representing the sufferings of the citizens of St Augustine in con-

for that purpose.
I beg leave to assure you, in reply, that the department has every
disposition to afford all the protection in its power to the citizens
of St Augustine, but it would not be authorized to act on an individual
application. It is necessary that it should come from the properly
constituted authorities and Guardians of the City, in their official
capacities—When this shall be done, the Department will give its
immediate and respectful consideration to the subject, although it is
believed that the troops which have recently been, and those which
will soon be, at St Augustine and its vicinity, will be ample for its
protection.”

Scarcity & high price of supplies, the distance generally to be travelled
to & fro, added to the fact that from June to October the lives of Man

necessity of giving contracts for Six months, four of which to be
actively engaged in the feild, the residue in going to returning from,

SIR I had the honor to receive your letter of the 34 September *
inclosing certain papers relative to the location approved by the
President on the 25" June 1835, of a tract of ten acres of land at the
junction of the S" Marks and Waculla rivers pursuant to the 3"
Section of the act of 3" March 1835,” and inquiring whether that
location should be laid down as a valid grant, when the road, which
then terminated at that point, has been carried beyond it to the site
of a town laid out by the Rail Road Company."
The Section of the Act referred to is in these words; “Be it enacted
that there shall be and is hereby granted to the said railroad
Company, ten acres of land at the junction of the S" Marks and
Waculla rivers, (the point where the road terminates,) exclusive of
such portions as shall be actually improved by individuals, and now in
their occupancy, and also exclusive of such portions as, in the opinion
of the President, it may be expedient to preserve for the national
defence, or other public use.” In pursuance of this grant, a tract
of land of ten acres, was located near the junction of the two rivers;
the location was laid down on the official plat, and being submitted
to the President of the United States was on the 25" of June 1835
approved by him in writing, upon the face of the plat. These facts
were communicated by the Commissioner of the General Land Office,

to the Surveyor General at Tallahassee on the 3 July 1835, and he
was directed to “take the necessary measures to have that tract laid
down upon the township plats.”
From the papers before me it does not appear that any doubt, as
to the propriety of this direction being carried into effect, exists on
the part of the General Land Office, or of the grantees, or of the
Department, but that it has arisen with the Surveyor General at
Tallahassee, from the fact of the railroad having been since carried
beyond the point of junction, while the clause in the act appears to
regard that as “the point where the road terminates.”
I am of opinion that it was not the intention of Congress that the
termination of the road at that place should be a condition of the grant;
or that the grant was to be forfeited upon the railroad being carried
beyond it. There is nothing in the language or object of the law
from which such an inference can properly be drawn. The clause
cited is merely descriptive of the place, and, with that object, had
reference to a fact which existed at the time the act was passed, and
afforded the most ready and natural designation. I am also of
opinion that the tract of land in question having been located more
than five years since; the President of the United States having ap-
proved that location; and the General Land Office having acted
definitively upon such approval and location—it ought to be laid
down without further delay as a valid grant.
The papers sent me are herewith returned. very respectfully yours

as I perceive the whole of Middle Florida, instead of being effectually
protected as I had every reason to expect from my arrangements, is
left exposed to be invaded and devastated by the Indians. When
General Read was here the plan he was lately pursuing for the defence
of his district was discussed and adopted, and I could not have sup-
posed that by making you the medium of calling out the troops the
operations thus determined upon would have been interrupted.
It is impossible, my dear Sir, that a general can have sufficient
authority over the troops he commands if any other person be em-
powered to interfere with his orders. After detaining General Read
here for several days in order to concert measures with him and agree
upon a plan of operations, it would be extremely inconvenient as well
as injurious to the interests of the public service to appoint another
commander. From your own recommendations, from his high char-
acter and from my personal observation, I have reposed great confi-
dence in General Read and believe him fully capable of redeeming
his pledge to relieve Middle Florida from the devastations to which
it has been so long exposed. But in order to enable him to effect this
desirable result he must have the entire disposition of the troops
under his command and those called into the service must understand
that they are to obey him. The mounted men, at least, must be active
troops ready to march whenever and wherever ordered and not be
left to act merely on the defensive. The footmen may be quartered
with a view to neighborly defence, but the mounted force must be
held ready to pursue or intercept the enemy whenever called upon.
If this description of mounted force cannot be raised and kept up in
Florida, I entreat you, my dear Sir, to say so that I may apply without
delay to the Governor of Georgia who has lately offered me a brigade
of mounted men for the Florida service. So expensive a class of troops
for mere neighborly defence unless under the System indicated to
General Read, cannot be sanctioned by the President or this depart-
ment.
I sincerely hope, that the difference which has sprung up between
you and the general will be speedily and amicably terminated. I am
sure that both of you are actuated only by a desire to promote the
public service and to defend the territory from the murderous savages:
but you must not be surprized, that the general's plans to effect that
object, emanating as they do from this department should be approved
by me in preference to others. They are much the most economical
and likely in my opinion to prove much the most efficacious.”
I am, Dear Sir, With esteem and regard Yours truly

SIR, I did not receive your letter from Tampa dated on the 7"

designated in General Macomb's treaty * as a measure most likely
to stay this uncertain and protracted war. After mature deliberation

of the territory of Florida to the Indians. By a treaty made with
them and ratified by the Senate,” they ceded their lands for a valuable
consideration to the Government, and this Department cannot
sanction any arrangement which, in contravention of the treaty,
would retrocede any portion of that purchase. If, however, it should
be found utterly impracticable to prevail upon the Indians to emigrate
to the new home provided for them in the West, a truce for an indefi-
nite period may be made with them, confining them South of a line
of posts to be established from Tampa Bay to New Smyrna, occupying
as nearly as may be, the sites of the old posts which it is understood
proved to be healthy when formerly occupied.”

I perceive that Fort King is fixed upon by that Chief as the place
of Rendezvous, and I am afraid it may embarrass your operations
to have the Indians collected at a spot so far within the line designated
above: for these attempts at negotiation must not be suffered to
interrupt hostilities against the other bands. It is believed the
probable success of your pacific policy will depend upon the vigor
of your operations in the field—You had better therefore, at once
fix upon some point on the proposed line from Tampa to Fort Mellon "
inclusive for the Indians to assemble, assuring them of their safety
South of it; but sending out detachments to scour the country to the
North, and urging the Officers to the utmost diligence and activity in
discovering and pursuing the enemy.
In negotiating with these Chiefs you will use your utmost endeavors
to persuade them to emigrate, and you may offer what you may
believe to be suitable inducements: for I do not entertain a doubt
of the favorable action of Congress on an application to redeem a
pledge given by the Executive under such circumstances.”

the Indians out of Middle Florida. It has been reported to me lately
that two Negroes have been taken from Colonel Gamble's plantation
by the Indians which shows that neighborhood not to have been as
vigilently guarded as I had hoped it would be. I beg that the posts
there formerly occupied by the Regulars may be reestablished and
kept up, and efficient protection afforded to those plantations which
have not been abandoned by their Proprietors. While we are laboring
to inspire confidence in the Settlers, and to induce them to return to
their farms and plantations, and maintain themselves there under a
Military organization, it would be highly injurious and impolitic to
suffer the Indians to plunder those which have been hitherto occupied.
General Armistead has informed the Department that he has opened
negotiations with some of the Chiefs of the Seminoles, and a delegation
of the tribe from the West will, it is presumed, have arrived in Florida
at the same time—It is not intended by these negotiations for the
peaceful emigration of the Indians, to interrupt the progress of hos-
tilities. General Armistead has been instructed to continue his
operations in the field North of a line to be drawn from Tampa to New
Smyrna—and even to urge them with greater vigor than ever. It is
believed that the success of the negotiations will depend very much
upon the activity of the operations in the field, and I beg that you will
act accordingly within the district under your command.

Governor of Florida suggests the expediency of confining the opera-
tions of Brigadier General Read to the district of Country North of a
line from St Augustine to St Andrews bay, so that the regular forces
under your command may approximate the settlements and defend
them. I desire to know your opinion of the necessity of this alteration
in the boundary of your respective commands at as early a day as you
can form it *—
Wild Cat's band appears to be committing frequent depredations in

RESOLUTIONS BY CITIZENS OF SAINT AUGUSTINE 70
[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:DS]
[November 27, 1840]
At a numerous and respectable Meeting of the Democratic citizens
of S*Augustine, friendly to the Division of Florida, held at the City
Hotel on Friday evening November 27" 1840.—of which General
Joseph M. Hernandez was Chairman, and David R Dunham Esq.”
Secretary; the following Resolutions were adopted with enthusiastic
acclamation.
Resolved—That as Citizens of the United States, we exult at the
late triumph of pure whig principles over power in panoply, as evi-
dence that the “Spirit of '76”, still glows unabated in the hearts of the
American people; and is no less formidable to domestic misrule and
corruption, than to foreign arrogance and despotism.
Resolved—That the elevation of General William Henry Harrison,
that enlightened Statesman and patriot soldier, to the highest office
of the Republic, is a reward due to his virtues and illustrious services;
and is an event auspicious to the cause of Liberty and the Union—
affording as it does, a new guarantee to the safety of our domestic
institutions.
Resolved—That as Citizens of Florida particularly, we rejoice at

the election of General Harrison to the Presidency, because his
character and his past services, are pledges of his future conduct;
That our entire confidence and undivided support, be given to his
administration, under whose paternal care, we look to see the best
interest of Florida consulted and promoted—The war that has so
long preyed upon her vitals, vigorously prosecuted and successfully
closed; and as a final and crowning act, called for, both by a regard
for her interests and those of her sister states, the admission of the
Eastern and Western divisions of the Territory, as twin stars, into the
glorious constellation of the Union.
Resolved—That the unprecedented and profane outrage, perpe-
trated by a frantic faction in this city, of burning in effigy, one of the
most time tryed, and distinguished patriots of the country—the man
who has since been elevated by the almost unanimous suffrage of his
fellow citizens, to the highest office in their gift, is an act repudiated
by the citizens of S" Augustine, and attaches disgrace only, to the
advisers and perpetrators of the foul deed.
Resolved—That it behooves the friends of the Division of the
Territory, to continue on the alert, and alive to the movements of the
opponents of this important and desireable measure.
Resolved—That our Delegate in Congress, the Hon: Charles
Downing, be requested to introduce into the House of Representatives
of the United States, as early in the approaching session as practicable,
a Bill, for the Division of Florida, in the manner heretofore urged by
the friends of the measure; and to oppose any and every attempt that
may be made in Congress, to erect the whole Territory into one state.

nated in the desire that full opportunity should be given them to pro-
duce a favorable impression upon their countrymen. It is considered
important that they should, if practicable, communicate with other
bands than those which met you at Fort King: and you will please
to afford them every facility for doing so, short of suspending your
Military operations.
In carrying on these, I cannot too strongly recommend to you the
protection of the country in the neighborhood of the settlements.
If the bulk of your force be withdrawn from that Quarter, the Indians
from the Withlacooche and Suwannee might concentrate and commit
ravages upon the frontier settlements that are still occupied, which no
success in the South could compensate for. It is to be apprehended
even that the Indians of the South if hard pressed, may double on
their pursuers, and by one of those rapid movements for which they
are distinguished, appear unexpectedly on the settled frontier. I
request, therefore, that the Northern division of the Army of the
South may be reinforced as much as possible and the Officers urged
to the utmost vigilance and activity.
I have directed a copy of the report of the Surgeon at Fort Colum-
bus” to be transmitted to you, by which you will perceive the injurious
effects of sending the sick from Florida to the North at this season
of the year. They will be retained at the depôts at Tampa, Cedar

Executive Department—TALLAHASSEE 26th December 1840
SIR, The assurances I have from time to time received from you,
respecting the payment of the public Debt and the interest thereon—
and the difficulty of obtaining funds available at the north—have
induced me to draw upon you for One thousand Dollars which is the
amount of that proportion of interest due on the 1" prox° at the Bank
of America. The remainder 3000$—although the Territorial Treasury
is empty—I shall endeavor to arrange with the Banks here. Of this
Draft you have already been advised by my private letters in which
also, I have estimated the sum due within the Territory for pay-
Subsistence—and forage at One Hundred and fifty thousand Dollars
over and above the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars bor-
rowed by the Territorial Executive. After some consideration I am
inclined to think my estimate too limited, and that Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars will be required to cover the expenses of the War
incurred by the Territorial Government in Middle and East Florida
to which must be added the above mentioned One Phetisand Hundred
Thousand Dollars borrowed on Territorial Account—forty three
thousand Dollars of which were expended by my predecessor the
Balance by myself.
I hope some order will be taken respecting the Dogs from Cuba—
as well those already in possession of the U. States Troops as those
remaining within the Territory. Something should be done by which
the Territory may be paid its expenses in procuring and keeping them.
They have been used and sometimes very efficiently—for the benefit
of the U States during this War.
I am happy to say that the Agent for liquidating claims has arrived
this day—the accounts are I believe all prepared and ready for his
investigation. I hope soon to hear, that appropriations have been
made to enable you to exonerate the Territorial Government from the
pressure of its pecuniary obligations.

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO WALKER. K. ARMISTEAD
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 23]
December 31 1840
BRIG: GENL: W. K. ARMISTEAD Tampa Florida
SIR I have received your communication of the 12th instant" and
am glad to find that you still entertain hopes of making peace with
the Indians of Florida.
At this distance it is difficult for the department of war to frame
such instructions as will meet every case: but the following suggest
themselves as most expedient for your adoption.
In your negotiations with the Indians you will council with Captain
Page of the Army and Major Armstrong of the Indian service if in
Florida, and you will proceed according to their advice. In the first
place every effort should be made to treat with the Seminoles proper.
The Micasuckies are notoriously treacherous as their conduct in
forcing the Seminoles away, who assembled to treat with General
Jesup, and in their late abrupt departure from Fort King, has suffi-
ciently proved. It cannot be doubted that the delegation from
Arkansas would exercise greater influence over the Seminoles than
over any other tribe; and in this particular I beg you will consult their
wishes, and suffer them first to communicate with their immediate
connections. It is unfortunate that the treacherous Micasuckies
were the first to propose to treat as they ought to have been the last,
and their late conduct gives you a fair opportunity to place them last
in your overtures to treat. Let communications through the western
Seminoles be first made to the Seminoles of Florida; next to the Creeks
who are in that country; then to Caocoochie's band; and last to the
Micasuckies. Although I do not wish your active operations to cease,
they ought not to be carried on at the very spot where the negotiators
are operating;—you will therefore suffer the delegation to communi-
cate with the Seminoles, and not molest them until they are satisfied
that they have no power to influence them, when there is reason to
believe they will point out the strongholds of the enemy, if they
persist in acting as such. The Seminoles may be assured that if they
retire south of the line from New Smyrna to Tampa indicated in my
former despatch, they will not be molested, and a short period may
be fixed upon for recommencing active and vigorous operations north
of that line. The negotiations may then be carried on at Tampa and
hostilities in that part of the territory which the Indians are called
upon to evacuate and from which they must be driven This plan has
the advantage of affording the western Seminoles a fair chance of
carrying out their own views, and besides, it is essential that it should

be promptly adopted and steadily pursued, because it is feared that
sufficient appropriations will not be made to enable the War Depart-
ment to keep on foot a sufficient militia force for the protection of the
settlements, and the withdrawal of too large a proportion of the regular
forces from that frontier to the extreme southern part of the peninsula,
might be attended with fatal consequences."

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLA-
TIVE COUNCIL AND OTHERS
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred December 31, 1840]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the
United States the undersigned Members of the Legislative Council,
and citizens of the Territory of Florida, Respectfully represents, that,
while it is well known to your Honorable body, that this territory is,
and has long been the theatre of Indian hostilities, involving the lives
and fortunes of your memorialists in danger; so that, scarcely a week
has past, for several years, without the news of some fresh murder;
and the efforts of the United States to fulfill the obligations of a pa-
ternal government, to a people, whom they accepted with a promise
of protection, have totally failed; the common facilities of intercourse,
between the seat of their Government, and that, to which they have
been taught to look for protection, seem to have been disregarded,
in the arrangements of the mail, the only channel of intelligence,
between this remote extreme of the Union, and its political center.
A dispatch, however important, in commercial intelligence, which
should place your memorialists on a footing with other sections of the
Union, arrives here, retarded by the negligence of the Post Master
General, or his deputies; by the arrangement of the mail, or of the
misconduct of those agents, by whom, they are forwarded; so that a
gentleman, who addresses a letter, from Washington, to Tallahassee,
will find, that, starting on the same day with his letter, he can reach
his destination, several days before its arrival.
By proper arrangements of the mails, a letter should reach Wilming-
ton, in North Carolina, from the City of Washington, when the river
Potomac, is not blocked up, by ice, in twenty four hours. Another
day, should suffice and does, in fact, suffice to transport a letter, or
passenger, from Wilmington, to Brunswic, in Georgia: and from
Brunswic to Tallahassee, a distance of 210 Miles, the journey is, now
performed, by commodious stages, in less than forty eight hours.

Thus, by a little attention, a public dispatch, from the Executive

to the Government here, or to his constituents, which now consumes
from nine, to fourteen days, in its tardy transit, between Washington
and Tallahassee, might be forwarded between those cities, in less than
four days.
Whether, the importance of prompt intelligence to our Merchants,
of the ever-varying price, of the staple commodity of this territory,
in the foreign market; or the still more momentous consequences,
involved in a subsisting war of extermanation, be duly regarded, the
prayer of your memorialists that their mail facilities be improved, is
worthy, they humbly concieve, of the attention of Congress."

BRIG: GEN: W. K. ARMISTEAD Tampa Bay Florida.
SIR I have been informed from a source entitled to credit that
an escort of eleven mounted infantry accompanying a wagon from
Fort Micanopy to Fort Wacahoota” was attacked by a party of
Indians and the commanding officer and several soldiers of the escort
killed. The force of this escort was, contrary to my instructions
and in opposition to your orders, entirely inefficient, and I think it
proper to call your attention once more to the subject.
Officers in command of posts must be required to obey orders, or
be brought to a court martial if they violate them on any pretext
whatever, whether, as in this case, loss of life and defeat be the con-
sequence of such disobedience or not. Discipline in the field and in
presence of the enemy must be enforced.
The circumstances attending this attack render it necessary that
the department should state its views in relation to escorts. It
appears that the eleven infantry soldiers were mounted,—a circum-
stance calculated to ensure a disastrous defeat in the event of encoun-
tering an enemy. It is not probable that any number of infantry
soldiers will be good horsemen, and when mounted, such men will
be fully occupied with keeping themselves in the saddle, and taking
care of their arms and accoutrements. Indians invariably get the
first fire, and, if the soldier is not shot, he is either thrown from the
startled animal's back or keeps himself on by throwing away his
musket: as appears to have been the case in this and other similar
cases. If a sufficient number of men should unexpectedly and prov-
identially retain their seats and their muskets to make battle, they
have to dismount exposed to the enemy's fire, and a certain number
of the remaining few must be detached to hold the horses while the
rest defend the baggage train. This is so obviously wrong that the
department positively forbids the continuance of the practice and
directs that the horses stationed at the posts to mount infantry sol-

JAMES WHITCOMB TO ROBERT BUTLER

January 23 1841
R BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee Flor Ter
SIR, I herewith enclose the copy of a letter from Leigh Read,”
Brig. Gen Flor: Brigade to this Office bearing date 26" Ult” re-
questing the co-operation of this Office in his plans therein explained
for protecting the inhabitants of Florida from the hostile Indians, by
ordering the survey of the public lands which lie on and near the
Suwannee river from the mouth thereof to its junction with the
Santa-Fee—for the purpose of enabling him to form settlements in that
vicinity. In which he likewise promises Military protection to the
persons who may be engaged in the survey, and states that he has made
arrangements for Deputies to be employed if this Department shall
think it advisable to give the necessary instructions to you.
I have to request that you will confer with Gen' Read if you have
not already done so, on the subject of his letter, and if in your opinion
the promised protection to the Surveyors will remove the objection of
danger from the Indians urged in your late correspondence with this
Office as the reason for not undertaking new surveys in Florida, you
are hereby authorized to contract for the immediate Survey and sub-
division into Sections of the tier of townships which includes the
Suwannee River from its junction with the Euchtucknee or Santa-Fee
to its mouth (excluding therefrom the townships or parts of townships
already surveyed) provided, thatsuitable Deputies can be found willing
to undertake the work under all the circumstances at the ordinary
prices allowed for surveying in your District, and the expence being
small will be borne out of the general appropriation for surveying,
the undrawn balance of which included a small amount for such
contingencies."
Please to advise this Office when your arrangements are completed
and transmit a copy of any contracts which may be made under this
instruction.”
I am Sir very respy Your Ob"S"

SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communi-
cation of 20" Ult,” requesting the Cooperation of this Office in your
plans therein explained for protecting the inhabitants of Florida from
the hostile Indians by ordering the survey of the public lands or a
portion of them which lie on & near the Suwannee river from the
mouth thereof to its junction with the Santa Fee, for the purpose of
enabling you to form settlements in that vicinity; in which you also
promise Military protection to the persons who may be employed in
the survey, and state that you have made arrangements for Deputy
Surveyors to be employed if this Department shall think it advisable
to give the necessary instructions to the Surveyor General.
In reply I have to state, that I have this day transmitted a copy
of your letter to the Surveyor General at Tallahassee, requesting him
to confer with you on the subject of its contents, and authorizing him
to contract for the immediate Survey and subdivision into Sections of
the tier of townships which includes the Suwanee river from its junc-
tion with the Eutchuckne or Santa-Fee to its mouth (excluding
therefrom the townships already surveyed) if in his opinion the prom-
ised protection to the Surveyors will remove the objection of danger
from the Indians urged in his late correspondence with this Office as
the reason for not undertaking new Surveys in Florida, and provided
that Deputies can be found to undertake the work under all the
circumstances at the ordinary prices allowed for Surveying in his
District."
It is deemed inexpedient under present circumstances to extend
the Surveys beyond those above indicated which however it is hoped
will supply the demand for new lands.”

as a means of inducing and forcing the Indians to remove. Whitcomb further
suggested that Indians considered land surveyed and marked no longer theirs.

JOHN PAGE TO T. HARTLEY CRAWFORD
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.: LS]
TAMPA BAY E. Florida 24. January 1841.
SIR: I have the honor to report, since my last communication”
negotiation has progressed very slowly, a small number of Mick-a-
suck-ies have come in and gave themselves up for emigration. The
deligation sent for one of the hostiles to come in, he did, and returned
to invite in Co-a-coo-chee: he went for him but could not find him.
A scouting party under the Command of Major Fauntleroy passed
through the Country he occupied and scattered them. The man col-
lected his little band together and sent in five of his warriours to re-
quire an escort to go as far as the With-la-coo-che bridge, sixty miles
from this place. An escort accordingly went under the command of
Colonel Clarke, on his arrival at the bridge the five Indians left the
escort to bring their people to join the Troops about the time they
were packing up a scouting party from Fort King came up to these
people and surrounded them and captured them, two of the number
were a short distance off and made their escape, a paper was produced
by the head man of this band that I gave him and the scouting party
let them go, and they immediately joined the Troops at the bridge
and Colonel Clark brought them to this place, thirty three persons
ten warriours among them. The reason they required this escort,
was, there was a band of Mick-a-suck-ies near them commanded by
Cosa Tus-te-Nug-gy and they said he would stop them if they were
discovered comeing in with their families to surrender. The escape
of those two men will have a bad effect as they will tell all those they
see what occurred, after being told they would not be molested and
captured afterwards, and they do not know but they were the same
Troops that came out to escort them in, neither will they know but
all were killed. This is the way I have been working ever since I
came here, when the prospects were the most flattering, all have been
prostrated by movements of this kind. If the business had been
properly conducted as I have repeatedly urged the General to do, it
would have been further advanced two months ago than it is now.
The same case has occurred down at Charlotts Harbor, some of the
deligation have been there for a long time and at two different times
collected a band together and scouting parties have scattered them.
They are now collecting them a third time, a Steamboat has gone
* Not identified.

down there to bring them up if they can collect them. The boat
should have returned yesterday, if it does not come to day I shall
think something serious prevents as it is not a long distance from Sam
Jones. Echo-E-Mathla Chief of the Tallahassees is now at Fort
Clinch with forty five of his people he sent for Tigertail to come to
him when all are expected here. I think the old Chief is sincere, his
nephew (one of the deligation) brought him in and is with him. He
sent his wife and children here to remain till he arrived He is expected
in a few days with Col Loomis. I have in camp now Eighty three
hostiles enrolled for emigration I have advised the General so soon
as Echo-E-Mathla arrives with his people to send off a party to New
Orleans as Indians get uneasy after being encamped some time no
matter how well they are treated
I have got a great many in by hireing one hostile to bring in another
so I have kept increasing the number in this way, but I have paid out
all my own money and am compelled to stop, though if I had money I
could do a great deal in this way. I expected Capt Armstrong on
here with money and told the Indians he would surely come; neither
the Quartermaster or Paymaster have a dollar and if the Florida
War could be closed by producing 4000 Dollars, it could not be raised.
I have done all I could do, I have worked hard but every thing has
gone wrong from my first commencement here. It is very important
Capt. Armstrong should come here with money or some other agent
or the business must stop.
Since writing the above the Steamboat that went to Charlotts
Harbor has just arrived with Twenty one Seminoles, Col Loomis has
also arrived from Fort Clinch with Echo-E-Mathla and forty five of
his people, he has sent runners out for the balance of them, so soon as
the runners return he is ready to emigrate, but wishes to notify all his
people to come in. Tigertail has not yet arrived but is still at Fort
Cross: Echo-E-Mathla has sent him a talk to come in—I am sending
out runners to other bands that have not been invited in, when they
arrive I will report their success—I have now in Camp about One
hundred & fifty hostiles
A Steamboat has gone to Key-Biscayne for Thirty Indians captured
by Col Harney, they will be here in about six days."

RECOMMENDATION OF RICHARD K. CALL FOR
APPOINTMENT AS GOVERNOR
[NA:SD, Applications:DS]
Tallahassee Florida SENATE CHAMBER Jany 25" 1841
TOW" HENRY HARRISON President of the United States.
We the undersigned Senators of the Legislative council of Florida,
feel it a duty we owe to our country and constituents to request the
reappointment of Richard K. Call as Governor of this Territory "
We believe that Genl. Call was removed without just cause and by
party intregue and management: His devotion to the interest of
Florida, his great personal sacrifices made in defending our citizens
from the dareing attacks of our savage foe, his untireing energy and
watchful gardeanship over every portion of this distressed and bleeding
country surely is intitled to the consideration of your Excellency.
The attempt to disgrace a meritorious and valuable officer, by re-
moving him, from a high and responsible Station—without notice or,
opportunity to defend himself, is under a government like ours unjust
and tyranical
The veriest criminal, cannot be punished by our constitution &
laws, without indictment and trial by Jury. and shall an officer of
merit and character, be dismissed without even being notified of the
cause or that any charge was prefered against him
The administration that has not the justice and firmness to inform
its officers the cause and reason of their removal, proclaims to the
* NA(OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 30), advising that the sum of $10,000.00 will be
remitted to Page for fulfilling the treaties with the Indians.

[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., A 21:LS]
Head Qrs: Army of Florida TAMPA. Jan' 26" 1841.
SIR I have the honor to inform you that I have now within the
chain of Sentinals at this post, one hundred and fifty Indians, Ten
of that number are of the Mickasukie, and the balance, of the Talla-
hassee tribe This I view in a favorable light, as their principal chief
Echo-emathla is with them, and they have stated that their object
in coming in, is, for the purpose of emigrating. Runners of the
Mickasukie tribe have been sent out from Forts Clinch and N° 4,
who have reported that they could bring in fifty or sixty of their
band; they are daily expected here—Should this result prove favor-
able, it will be a leading feature in terminating this war, particularly
as it is combined with the arrival (yesterday) of a party of Seminoles
from Pease Creek under charge of my Aide-de-Camp. Lt. L. A.
Armistead 6* Infy."
It is much to be feared that it will take some time before any
others in that portion of the country will be induced to come in,
notwithstanding every exertion on my part has been made to induce
them to do so; but I shall still continue to negotiate, with hopes
of success.
So far as it relates to the Tallahassees appearances are favorable,
provided no disappointment occurs from the promises and stipula-
tions which I have made them, and which I trust will be complied
with on the part of the government. These stipulations were detailed
in my communication to the department on the 16” Inst.;" and I
am convinced that had money been furnished me at an early period,
this war would have been terminated, as these people have but little
faith in promises.
I have just concluded a talk with Echo-emathla the Chief of the
Tallahassees who says the remainder of his people will be in, in two
or three weeks—many of them are in Middle Florida. He has sent
runners out to them with a talk, which will no doubt induce them
to meet him at this post in twenty days.
I have despatched in a Steam Boat my Asst. Adjt. Gen'l to Key
Biscayne, to conduct to this post the thirty two Indians captured by
Lt. Col. Harney in the everglades. On their arrival I shall ship

SIR. I have the honor to inform you. that I have just received
information from Fort Clinch of the arrival at that post of Seventy
two Indians, (and the daily expectation of others,) who have come
in for the purpose of emigrating to Arkansas, this number consists
of various tribes, who have inhabited Middle Florida; this result is
most favorable. An Officer will this day be dispatched in a Steam
Boat to bring them to this place, where many of their friends are
awaiting their presence. The breaking up of the different bands,
may in a short time induce those who still resist to follow their friends
example, of which I feel confident, with the exception of the small
parties of the Seminoles residing in the Southern Section of the Terri-
tory, these people still persist in remaining out.
I have again sent out Six of the delegation with a part of the 8"
Reg' to see if they could again negotiate with the remnant of their
people, which I think it most probable they will effect when they
understand the other bands are now here with their families.
All circumstances combined, I trust will lead to a favorable result."

BRIG: GEN: W. K. ARMISTEAD Tampa Bay, via Garey's Ferry,
Florida.
SIR. The intelligence which has been received of the success attend-
ing the scouting parties of Lieut: Colonel Harney and Major Childs
in the everglades and along the eastern coast of Florida is highly
gratifying and you will be pleased to signify to those active and
enterprising commanders and to the officers and men who served
under them, the approbation of the President and of this department,
of the zeal perseverance and gallantry they have evinced on these
occasions.”
I hope my late orders will not have induced you to put a stop to
these expeditions along the eastern coast and among the islands in
the everglades. The desperate character of the Spanish Indians and
of those marauders who prowl along that coast seeking the destruction
of the unfortunate men who may be wrecked or cast ashore there,
renders it very desirable that they should be driven in or destroyed.
Operations against them would not affect the movements of those
Indians who are disposed to come in to Tampa, and I think it all im-
portant that the everglades and coasts should be thoroughly secured.
The circumstances of the Florida contest are so much changed
since my instructions to make a truce if nothing better could be done,
leaving to the Indians the country south of a line drawn from Tampa
to New Smyrna for an indefinite period, that I have determined to
withdraw that discretionary authority. From the prudence and zeal
which you have heretofore manifested in all your operations and ne-
gotiations with the Indians, the department entertains well grounded
hopes that you will be able to bring the war to a close upon the terms
required by the treaty, and by the interests and feelings of the people
of Florida. The department never contemplated leaving the Indians
for any period of time in possession of any portion of the Territory;

but expected after they had remained quiet a short time to have been

31st December with a talk and twelve medals for the deligation”
I delivered the talk to them and presented the medals in the name
of their Great Father with the proper explanations, No-co-se-o-hola
addressed the crowd, and said they the deligation were once hostile
but; saw the evil of their situation, came in and emigrated, and their
Great Father had given them a good Country and all he promised
them. He held up a medal and said, this shews in what manner we
stand with our Great Father: and those who are now hostile and are
disposed to come in, will be looked upon in the same light and treated
in the same manner as we are treated. I was sent here by our Great
Father to prevail on our Brothers to lay down their arms and surrender
themselves for emigration, some have thought proper to take our
talk, and we hope all will do the same
So long as we can be useful we will, take our Great Father's talk
and remain here as he requests &c
Since my last report Seventy two Mick-a-Suck-ies and Tallahassies
have come in at Fort Clinch and are expected here in a few days, I
have Several runners out with the deligation among the different
bands, and if not interrupted by Scouting parties I hope they will meet

mote pacification

SIR I have directed the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to remit to
you a sufficient sum of money to enable you to remove the Indians
now at Tampa and other posts of the peninsula to their homes in the
west, as well those who have been captured as those who have vol-
untarily surrendered:—this operation to take place with as little
delay as possible. I have likewise directed a disbursing agent to
report to you and you will please detail an officer of the army to
superintend the removal.
Application has been made to Congress to appropriate $100,000
for the purposes signified in your letter to the Adjutant General of
the 16" ultimo * and the money shall be remitted to you as soon as
the Department is in funds.”
It appears to me that it would be prudent to order that whenever
one of your scouting parties captures a band of Indians who signify
their intention to come in, they should not be left entirely to their
own will, even when furnished with a passport, but be persuaded to
accompany the party to Tampa, and if necessary, be coerced to do so.
When there the sooner they are despatched to the West, the better.”

SIR I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration
of the Committee on Military Affairs a copy of a communication to the
Adjutant General from General Armistead commanding the Army in
Florida, asking a remittance of $100.000 to enable him to comply with
his promises to the hostile Indians in Florida in the event of their
surrendering themselves for emigration. In the present temper of the
Indians and from the fact that a number have already come in at the
various posts and surrendered their arms, there is reason to hope that
General Armisteads' promise will induce them to come in and give
themselves up for removal to the West. The course adopted by the
General has therefore met the approbation of the department, both
as a measure of economy and humanity as the inducement held out by
him is calculated to end this protracted contest at much less expense
of blood and treasure than to continue the war another month.
The department has however no means under its control applicable
to the object, and respectfully recommends that an appropriation of

HONBle JOHN J. CRITTENDEN
DEAR SIR I take the liberty of troubling you with an account
of matters and things in this territory, as they at present exist. The
Whig or Harrison party, at the head of which stood Gen' Call and
his personal and political friends, carried the elections at the October
election, and returned a Whig majority to both branches of the
Council. The Whigs were then confident of electing members of
their party Speakers in each house which would have been done
but for the ambitious views of some persons, who had acted with us
in the late elections; I allude now to Colo. Wyatt," and Maj. Ward.”
The one wishing to be Governor and the other delegate to Congress.
Owing to their management, our party was defeated, and M" Gautier *
one of the most abusive, and violent loco foco Editors in Florida was
elected Speaker of the Lower House over an old and well tried Whig,
one of the most respectable and intelligent men in the territory;
Col° Wyatt & Maj' Ward after dividing the Whig party, and defeating
Gen' Brown * for Speaker purchased the Whig press—and had
strong recommendations made thro the columns of the Star, of
Col° Wyatt for Governor of Florida and Maj' Ward for delegate.
The recommendations are believed in fact are known to be written
by Wyatt and Ward themselves—and intended for effect at Washing-
ton, with the Whig Administration, and with the people of this
territory—Wyatt has left for Washington, with a recommendation
for himself signed by many of the loco foco members of the Council,

and some few Whigs citizens of the territory—when you see Wyatt,
if you should see him, you will be convinced of his unfitness for the
high office he solicits. He is in short, a perfect black guard; having
nothing to recommend him. There is not a respectable man in the
territory independent of selfish or interested motives, who could or
would say that he thought Wyatt either qualified for the office,
or that he would not be the most unpopular appointment which
could be made Let Gen' Harrison give us, who he will for governor,
except this man, even the present incumbent unprincipled and imbe-
cile as he is; would be better than Wyatt.
As regards Gen' Call you are aware of the unnecessary and
unjustifiable, manner in which he was removed from office. His
removal, had great influence in changing the politics of Georgia, and
rallied the Whigs, in Florida. and his reappointment to office would
give more general satisfaction to the people of Florida than any
other which could be made. The people of respectability, and the
old Citizens desire his appointment much more than he does. They
think the office due to him, for his long services, and his persecutions;
for the part he took in their defense.
It would be gratifying to Gen'Call to have the office tendered to
him; and for Gen' Harrison to place him in that office from which,
he was taken by M. Vanburen. But of the propriety of his reappoint-
ment you are a better judge than myself.
My family are well. I am doing well in my profession, making
more money than I have ever made by the practice—I have read
with much pleasure your late speech in the Senate on the preemption
Bill. I think you are the first Senator who ever made Benton *
Quail, before him or compliment him afterwards. Permit me to say
I think your speech one of the best ever delivered in that Body.”

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of

of a letter to him from Samuel Grice) which was referred to this
office for report.—The Secretary of the Navy desires to be informed,
“whether under the preemption laws, settlers on lands not yet
reserved derive a right from their inchoate title to cut and sell timber”
and suggests that if his department were furnished with lists &
plats of the reservations for live-oak purposes its business with
respect to live-oak lands would be greatly facilitated—
In reply, I have to state that this office is not aware of any law,
giving any person a right to cut and sell any timber on public land.
The lists & plats spoken of, are in the course of preparation, and will
be furnished as soon as practicable, the informal communications
between this office and the Navy Department having sometime since
suggested the propriety of preparing the documents alluded to, and

TALLAHASSEE 15" Feby 1841
DEAR SIR I had anticipated the pleasure of meeting you at
Washington on the 4” of March to join in our Countries jubillee on
the glorious event of that day. But I am compelled to deny myself
that gratification.
My friends, and I believe a very large majority of the people of
this territory, are desirous that I should be appointed Governour of
Florida. For my own part I have verry litle concern on the subject.
But as I was turned out, most unjusty by M. Van Buren, it would
be some what gratifying to my feeling, to be restored to office, by
the man who turns him out with the acclamation of the people.
An individual by the name of Wyatt, is an aspirant for this office,
and has gone to Washington to procure it. His presumption is only
equaled by his ignorance. Congress has been spelt with a K by some,
but this fellow spells Rut with a “W--rutte”. This is a fair specimen
of his literary acquirements. He has beged letters of recommendation
and introduction, from Locofocoes, and from Whigs, who had not
firmness to deny his importunities. He will probably endeavour to
make your acquaintance, and if you will indulge him for a fiew mo-
ment in conversation, you will find him the best witness, to prove his
own unfitness and unworthyness of the Station. He professes to
have been some twenty years since, the intimate personal friend of
Genl Harrison. This is quite impossible. But he has made those
more ignorant than himself believe this, and that his influence over
the Genl will be unbounded. He has pledged the public patronage

to some extent, and in this way has enlisted some followers, to sign
a petition in his behalf.” This man thinks me to be in his way and
will therefore endeavour to create a prejudice against me. He will
probably represent me to Genl Harrison, as a defaulter to the Govern-
ment. Permit me therefore if you please, to explain my situation in
this particular to you, and request you to see the Genl on the subject.
My accounts as late Governour have been entirely closed with the
Government. Some time past I held the office of Rec' of public
monies, at this place, for about eleven years. My accounts, were
regularly forwarded agreeably to the regulations of the Department,
and on leaving the office, I accounted for all the money I had ever
recd. My vouchers were sent to the proper department, where they
remained for several years without adjustment, and finally without
their examination, I was reported as a defaulter for the sum of $43.400.
I repelled this falsehood, and demanded an immediate settlement.
After some delay on their part, my accounts were taken up, and
$34.000 of that sum were passed to my credit. Subsequently $3.000
more were allowed, and while the balance of the account was in prog-
ress for a final settlement, I was removed from the office of Governour,
for expressing the contempt which I honestly felt for Mr Poinsett,
and some of the measures of that Administration. This reason could
not be given in justification, when the Senate by resolution, called
on the president for information on the subject of my removal, and
with a view of creating a false impression against me I was immediately
sued for the balance then claimed, ($6.000) After the commencement
of the action, some of my vouchers were allowed and the balance
now in suit is $4.000 some odd hundred dollars A part of this is for
money paid by me on account of the Government, more than ten
years since, and another part is for money which was never rec" as
I am prepared to prove in court. Against this sum of $4.000 and
odd dollars, I have well authenticated vouchers, and ofsetts, to the
amount of $17.500. The case stands for trial at the next term of
our April Court, and I have no doubt of obtaining a verdict against
the Government for 10 or 15.000 dollars at least.
Should Genl Harrison determine to remove the present incumbent,
and be disposed to appoint me to the office of Governour, I would
respectfully suggest the propriety of postponing all action on the case,
untill after the April term of our court, when I shall be fully vindicated
from all the false accusations of the late Administration. I desire
this to relieve the Genl, as well as myself, from all embarassment.
Should he not be disposed to appoint me, I hope he will at least confer
the office on a gentleman, and not on M* W* Wyatt, who has been

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF ST. JOHNS
COUNTY
[NA:SF, 26 Cong., 2 sess.:DS 57]
[Referred February 16, 1841]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America, in Congress assembled:
The undersigned, citizens of the United States, and residents of the
County of St Johns in East Florida, respectfully represent to your
Honorable Bodies, that they have heard, with much surprise and
anxiety, of a purposed Treaty with the Seminole Indians, by which
is to be ceded to them all that portion of this Territory lying South
of a line drawn from Tampa Bay across the peninsula East to New
Smyrna: And, under the most fearful apprehensions of the conse-
quences of such a Treaty to themselves, and to the whole country,
your memorialists deem it their duty to solicit the interposition,
by your Honorable Bodies, of such measures as may avert the im-
pending calamity.
The struggle to subdue these Indians has now lasted more than
five years; during which time the country has been desolated, and
drenched with blood. To relax under existing circumstances, and
grant to them the most desirable portion of East Florida, would, in
the opinion of your memorialists, be so palpable and inglorious a re-
cession from the reiterated determination of the Government of the
United States, that it could not fail to inspire the Indians with such
increased confidence in their own strength, and to delude them into
such great contempt for the apparent weakeness of the Government,
as would only increase the difficulty of a future acquisition of the
ceded Territory.
During those disastrous years, your memorialists have all suffered
more or less, either directly or consequently, by the destruction of

property, by the loss of time, by the interruption of their accustomed
avocations, and by the embarassments incident to a long state of
anxiety and suspense: while some have been reduced from wealth or
competency, to poverty or utter ruin. And should the purposed
Treaty be consummated it will extinguish the hopes of those who have
looked forward to the restoration of peace, and a return to their
homes; for after their late sad experience they could feel no security
in the vicinity of those frantic and merciless savages, who it is seen,
will not remain quiet, but will break out again; when the works at the
different Posts, together with the other preperations made to prose-
cute this war, and which have been attended with such enormous
expence, will have to be renewed.
Your Memorialists further represent, that the country which it is
intended to grant to the Indians comprises the finest portion of East
Florida, and, possessing a climate sufficiently near the tropical temper-
ature to admit of the profitable culture of many productions peculiar
to such latitudes, it would, if the Indians were removed, soon be filled
with a population capable of contributing much to the commercial
independence and wealth of the United States, to the defence of a
weak maritime frontier of great extent, and to the protection of a large
coasting trade: while, on the other hand, if the Indians should be
allowed to occupy it there would be no security for the settlers North
of them; they would continue to murder the unfortunate crews, and
plunder the property, of the numerous vessels annually wrecked on
the coast; and, in the event of a war between the United States and
Great Britain—whose relations with this country are now ominous,
and whose West Indian possessions are contiguous to Florida—this
exposed point of attack, occupied by our savage foes, would offer to
our civilized enemy such temptations to incite the former to deeds of
outrage as would be almost irresistible even to a less scrupulous
Government—a government that is now causing to be disciplined
for war the colored population of her American Colonies—a descrip-
tion of troops which might be used in the Southern portion of the
Union for the most mischievous purposes.
As a means of terminating the more speedily this expensive and
destructive war, of hastening the settlement of the country, and
thereby averting the calamities consequent upon a relinquishment
of the Southern part of this Peninsula to the Indians, your Memorial-
ists respectfully solicit from your Honorable bodies the favorable
consideration of the Senates' Bill, entitled “An Act to provide for the
armed occupation of Florida,” ” and that, in addition thereto, your
Honorable bodies would pass an Act authorising the President to re-

pedient—to cooperate with the regular Army; or that your Honorable
bodies would adopt such other measures as may be considered best
suited to effect a termination of the war by the removal of the Indians
to their destined homes West of the Mississippi.”

DEAR SIR If you have not lost all recollection of as remote, and
unobtrusive, individual as myself, I beg you will use your influence
in procuring the appointment of marshal of the Middle district of
Florida, for my friend Maj. Minor Walker"—The present incumbent
is the last man that Mr Van Buren should have appointed to the Office
of marshal, for many reasons 1" because he never was a man of
business 2" because he has not capacity, and common sense sufficient
to learn his duties 3" He is a man of violent passions and prejudices—
and is incapable of acting with that impartiallity that the office
demands—4" He is a professed duelisto and has been engaged in
some of the most bloody and savage contests, that ever occured in
any country—5" because he has never attended to any of the duties
of marshal, because he has been for near a year Genl in command of
the Florida Wollunteers & it is not proper that the civil power & the
military should be united in the same individual, except in the case
of the president and governors of states & Territorys—Last spring
Genl Leigh Read was appointed a visitor to West point—Marshall of
66a Charles B. Penrose?

Middle Florida * and Genl. in command of the Florida Wollunteers—
all this was done in my opinion to Obtain Governor Branches influence
in North Carolina in Favour of Mr Van Burens election, and Govr.
Branch is the father of Genl. Reads wife—I was delighted that the
good old North State, honestly rejected Mr Van Burens claims—the
influence of Gov" Branch notwithstanding—we have had the most
wortheless and inefficient men appointed to office in our territory;
and I trust that the president elect will let all such retire—and that
all those in office who have discharged there duties (and not used the
influence of office to control the elections) tho’ they have differed, in
opinion as to the person who should be our chief magistrate will
be retained
Mr Walker was strongly recommended to office at the time of Genl.
Reads appointment, and no doubt he was rejected because he was
against the late administration, If you can take an active part in the
appointment of Maj'. Walker you will not only gratify myself and
his other friends but I assure you his appointment will be highly
acceptable to the majority of the people of Middle Florida, I have
written to my friend Honb" John J. Crittenden " on this subject also
and trust the application may be as successful as I know the man to
capable and deserving of the confidence of the administration "

SIR, I acknowledge, with much satisfaction, the receipt of your
letters of the 1*** and 14th instant.”
The engagements made by you with the Indians to allow them, on
condition of their emigration, certain sums of money and arms, are
sanctioned by the Department, as you were advised in a former letter,
and Congress has made an appropriation of $100,000,” the amount
asked for by you, for that purpose. Of this $25.000. was remitted
some days since, and the Secretary of the Treasury will to day be
requested to make immediately a further remittance of the same
amount. A disbursing Agent having been appointed (Legrand Capers
Esqr)" the funds had better be placed in his charge. The law making
the appropriation contains a provision that the rifles shall not be

given to the Indians till after their arrival in the country assigned to
them West of the Mississippi.
Although I continue of the opinion that it would be better for the
service to withdraw three-fourths of the horses from the posts where
Infantry is stationed, the order to that effect will not be persisted in by
the Department.
Your measures, so far, have been so judicious, and been attended
with so much success, a confident hope is entertained that the pro-
tracted difficulties in Florida will be speedily and finally terminated.
I cannot too strongly urge upon you to send off the Indians from
the territory as promptly as it can possibly be done, though your
determination to retain some of the males for necessary purposes is
approved."

SIR, I have the honor to report since my last communication,” the
prospect of negotiation is very flattering—I have runners out with a
talk to the Chiefs of the different bands, several of them have come
in and agreed to emigrate. Cosa Tus-te-nug-gy is now here, he is
the 2nd Chief of the Mick-a-suck-ies, he has agreed to come in and
bring his people; Sam Jones (his head Chief) he has sent for, and told
the runner to say to him, he, was determined to bring in his people
and emigrate to Arkansis, and that he wished him to join him, that
he had seen and talked with the Deligation, and was satisfied with
their new Country West. Coo-a-coo-che has agreed to meet some
of the deligation on the 4th inst, near Col Worths camp about 45
miles from this; one of the deligation I have sent is, an uncle to Coo-
a-coo-che, and I feel pretty well assured he will bring him in with his
people. The Seminoles proper, have also agreed to come in—the two
head men have agreed to meet me at Sirasota in about 10 or 12 days
and bring in their people. Echo-E-Math-la Chief of the Tallahassee
is now in, with nearly all his people—Tigertail is still out with about
25 persons, but the old Chief has sent for him, and says he cannot
remain out The spirit of emigration appears to be so general I have
good cause to report favourable. I have made known to the head
men, what they shall have if they comply with their promise, each
head man to receive $5000.

The deligation are all out and exerting themselves, and are equally
confident with me of our prospects. This is the first time I have had
confidence enough to report favorable, I have enrolled about Three
hundred twenty five that are now in, and shall hope to get them
started for Arkansas about the 8th inst. I will report to you as
usual how I progress with negotiation "
Six persons came on here, with a man by the name of Brown at
their head, they came authorized by M Poinsett to report here to
aid in negotiation and wished to have an interview with the deliga-
tion, but they declined having any thing to do with them, as also the
Indians that had come in to emigrate—"The deligation said at once
they should be sent away, or, they would ruin every thing that was
going on, -all the Indians said at once, they came here to look out
for Negroes, and if they were not sent off, the Negroes that were
out with the hostiles would prevent them from comeing in, I re-
monstrated against their remaining here and General Armistead sent
them off
It was a great error in M* Poinsett appointing and authorizing such
people to come here, and surely a want of confidence in those engaged
in the negotiation.”
During their stay here, three days, they were making affadavits
before a Justice of the peace relative to the negroes now here

SIR. I have the honor to inform the department that the principal
sub-chief of the Mickasuckies, Coosa Tustenuggee left my Head
Quarters yesterday to collect his people for emigration. They are
to be in by the 20" inst, and it is not doubted that Halick Tustenug-
gee's band will follow their example. As these leaders have during
the war proven themselves among the most implacable of the hostiles,
I consider the appearance of Coosa-Tustenuggee and his avowed
determination to join the emigrating party as a decided indication
of the approaching close of this long & expensive war.
I am now anxiously waiting the funds that have been appropriated
to enable me to fulfil my promises with the chiefs and people who
have come in—Until they arrive I cannot think of shipping any of
the Indians, as all the promises I have made, I expect punctually to
fulfill, & this cannot be done until the means are placed at my disposal.
This want of the necessary funds has alone prevented an immediate
shipment of those now here. I therefore most respectfully request
that the funds should be sent with all possible despatch.” The
Indians are becoming restless, and expecting what I have promised,
they must not be deceived.

now that your Excellency had accepted the office, tendered by an al-
most unamious suffrage we confidently expect, relying on your dis-
tinguished Military talents, that out beloved country will not longer be
the theatre of horrid & barbarous massacres,—but the arrogant &
wily savage, who has for so long a time infested & laid waste our
fertile fields sparing neither age, sex, or condition, be taught that a
General & a Warrior now holds the reins of Government. Jackson-
ville then must become insignificant—
Your Memorialists would further shew that from the situation of
our Town we believe that we are entitled to the Custom House—at
present at Jacksonville That situated there it can exercise no influence
in checking smuggling—That some of your memorialists are aware of
the fact that a vessel freighted with sugar from the West Indies runs
into the River & having disposed of part of her cargo, again puts to
Sea with impunity—That vessels invariably anchor here—& the
establishment of a Port of Entry at this place would enable them to
proceed at once to their destined port Palatka. thereby greatly facili-
tating mercantile operations. That vessels compelled from un-
favourable weather or other causes to cross the Bar must either pro-
ceed Thirty miles up the River or depart without entering or clearing—
Your Memorialists would respectfully assure your Excellency That
in speaking of Jacksonville Your Memorialists are incited not by en-
vious or unfriendly feelings—but on the contrary entertain towards
said City & her many highly respectable & worthy citizens—the most
sincere sentiments of affection & regard—But facts speak for them-
selves—Jacksonville has no back country to contribute to her sup-
port—& real estate is rapidly decreasing in value-
Having shewn your Excellency That the establishment of a Port
of Entry at this place is not advantageous solely to our Town, but
that the Interest of the Federal Government requires it & that the
general welfare of the Country is thereby promoted, by effectually
preventing the Contraband trade. Your Memorialists with confident
reliance of the well known liberality & devotion to the public good
which in so eminant a degree distinguish your public & private life
most respectfully solicit your Sanction to & approval of the removal
of the Custom House from Jacksonville & its location at Hazard, &
Your Memorialists would recommend as a suitable person to fill the

BRIGADIER GENERAL W K. ARMISTEAD Tampa Bay Florida
SIR, The Adjutant General has submitted to me your letter of the
28" ultimo" in which you request instructions relative to the dis-
position of the negroes who may come in with the Indians.
There can be no claim against the Indians for any negroes except
those who may have run away or been captured since the treaty of
Payne's Landing. That treaty set apart a certain sum for paying the
claims against them for depredations and losses of all kinds. This
commuted all such claims for money, and absolved the Indians from
liability for and beyond the amount thus stipulated.” No demand
can therefore be recognized for any negroes except those lost since the
date of the treaty, unless the Indians are willing to give them up vol-
untarily. All except these must positively be removed with the

Armistead had ordered him from the post; the Adjutant General to the Secretary

Crawford to the Secretary of War, Feb. 27, 1841 (NA, OIA Rept. Bk. 2), that the
Seminole will not consider the negroes sold to J.C. Watson as government negroes
and therefore exercise no control over them. Crawford saw no objection to trans-
ferring the slaves to Watson. See Armistead to the Secretary of War, Mar. 7, 1841
(NA, WD, SW Reg. of Lets. Recd., A 64), that the claims preferred by the St.
Augustine deputation (not seen) to certain negroes had caused much excitement
among the Indians; and the question is raised whether the slaves must be given up
to the claimants. Armistead then advises that his predecessors declared that
every negro who should voluntarily come in should be free, as a copy of a certificate
by Gen. Taylor discloses.

Indians to the West unless an arrangement, perfectly satisfactory to
them, for their delivery can be made with them by the claimants.
Those of which the Indians have acquired possession since the treaty
should be surrendered, unless the effect of this would be to prevent the
Indians from coming in and removing. This should by all means be
avoided, and it will be better, rather than incur this danger that even
the negroes to which the whites have a valid claim should also be
removed, and afterwards brought back or be paid for by the United
States. No negro should be delivered up under any circumstances
unless the claim to him be substantiated by the most satisfactory
proof.”

TAMPA BAY, East Florida 14 March 1841.
SIR I have the honor to report since my last communication,”
negotiation has been going on with great success. Cose. Tus-te-
nug-gy left here a short time since; while here, a war party had a
skirmish with a small detachment of soldiers for the purpose of
breaking up the negotiation-Cosa, disregarded that, and said, he
would bring in his people 81 in number, and at the same time, send
runners up to Fort King, there, to hold a talk with He-lick Tus-te-
nug-gy and bring his people here, also, Cosa appointed a place 35
miles from this on the road, to meet the Waggons and escort, to
bring in his people;—Captain Wright started with seven waggons and
eighty soldiers and two Indians;–when he arrived at the place
appointed by Cosa to come to him, he did not find him—the two
Indians went out to Cosa's Camp and found the mounted companies
under Capt Kerr had been there and captured him and his people,
and carried them to Fort King, also the runners he sent to Fort King
with a talk to Helick, notwithstanding they all had passes from
General Armistead, expressing the object of their mission—they were
confined, also this Cosa, who was the most important chief in the
Nation. I was sure if he came, the whole must follow, and he said
we must not mind a little party that was trying to break up the
Treaty, he would make all come in, after he had got his own people in.
I do not know what effect this unfortunate occurrence will have
with this Chief, it is possible he may be reconciled upon explaining
&c—I hope Captain Kerr will not claim it as a victory in surprising
a party of Indians on their way here, Cosa had a pasport with him
and told Capt Kerr (as he says) he was on his way to meet Captain
Wright who was waiting for him but; Capt. Kerr took them to Fort
King, instead of bringing them here, and from that point wanted to
take them to Pilatka about sixty miles farther off—If this Officer
had come ten miles this side of where he captured the Indians, he
would have found Capt Wright waiting for them, as Cosa the Chief
told him—This is the way the business goes on, and has ever since I
arrived at this place: with this kind of management, it will take
twelve months to do, what might be done in two—

Indians, most of them Mick-a-suck-ies Par-suck-e-ohola (one of the

SIR I have most respectfully, in the name of the Whig party of
Florida, to protest against the influence of M* Charles Dowing, Late
Delegate from that Territory in the removals from, and appointments
to office for said Territory
M" Dowing was elected by the Van Buren party, and as there has
been no exspession of public sentiment in relation to him since that
time, He is the Delegate (if one attal) of that party and not of the
Whig reform party of Florida
The Whig party of that Territory have now in regular nomination
Geo. T. Ward Eqr, as there candidate for Delegate to Congress,
whilst M. Dowing is known as the candidate, of the eleventh-hour
men from the Jackson & Van Burean ranks
The Whig party therefore of that Territory who were the first to
come forward to the support of your ellevation, have some right to
expect to be heard in relation to those appointments, not that this
should be inflund, by the same party, that made reform nessary
If your Excellency have any doubts of the correctness of the stand
I have here taken I beg & request that all removals and appointments
may be postponed in Florida until after our election for Delegate, which

under the chief Echo.emathla: the remainder are Seminoles and
Mickasuckies. It gives me great satifaction to state that no force
was necessary in the embarkation, all leaving with perfect willingness.
There are now in, here and at Fort Armistead about 150 Indians,
which number will probably be swelled in a few days to 250 or 300.
I have succeeded in entirely reassuring Coosa Tustenuggee, whose
people 80 in number may soon be expected; also the party of Coacoo-
chee: that Chief himself will be here to morrow. Some of Hospitakees
band, have come in to Fort Armistead; Hospitakee with the remainder
will ultimately join them."
A runner has been despatched to Sam Jones, who sent word that
he would meet one of the delegation on Pease creek, to hear my talk.
I have little doubt that he will soon come in with his people.
Runners have been sent to Middle Florida, to bring in the remnant
of the Tallahassees who are still lingering there. This will free that
section of country of all the Indians, as the runaway Creeks have left
it, and are now east of the Suwannee. I have not yet been able to
communicate with them but hope to do so through Halick Tus.te-
nuggee, when he shall come in. A runner has been sent to this last
chief by Coosa Tustenuggee, and I am sanguine that he will eventually

SIR, I have the honor to report, that about 220 Indians were shipped
yesterday for New Orleans, on their way to Arkansas. There are
remaining in camp, Eighty five, I did not intend to leave any, but,
while I was rallying them to go on board, the General was constantly
giving some, permission to stay, he was not aware, if he gave one man
permission to remain all his brothers and sisters and their children
remain with him—I told him if he did not stop giving permissions,
and leave it to me to judge, I could not get off Fifty Indians, without
forceing them with the aid of Troops—the General stoped his permis-
sions, and I started them off at once without any difficulty—They
were all unwilling to start, but I gave but one talk that was, you have
to go; this settled the point, but when they found they could get leave
to remain, by going to the General, it destroyed my influence and
authority over them and for a short time, some considerable excite-
ment was produced, until the General left the business with me
altogether—too many people, acting and directing in a case of this
kind is very injurious—there should be but one talk and one action
in the business, and they will know what to depend on. I leave
tomorrow for Sarasota where I expect to meet 90 or 100, that have
come in there, —there are about sixty with Capt Wright at To.
a-choat Ku and others comeing in. Coo-a-coo-chee is expected here
in two or three days with Colonel Worth.

SIR, Annexed is an Estimate of Furniture, and its prices necessary
for the Hall of Representations and Senate Chamber in the New
Capitol of the Territory—and I have employed M. Jacobi to furnish
the apartments just mentioned provided it shall meet with your
approbation.
As to the prices, I am not competent to judge—I have said to him,
they will be investigated, and diminished, should it be found proper
to make them less.
In relation to the Seats for the President of the Senate and the
the Speaker of the House—prices must be much reduced, for the plans
originally approved by me, are found since the Building has been
erected, not to harmonize with the form and size of the apartments
in which they are to be placed.
It is not to be expected that materils and Labor can be procured as
cheaply here as at the North—but M Jacobi is an excellent Work-
man—a Master of his business—and I doubt not will faithfully per-
form his duty should the work [which it is important to have completed
during the coming Summer]" be committed to his care.”
I am Sir, Very respectfully Y Obt

March 25th 1841
BRIGADIER GENERAL W. K. ARMISTEAD TAMPA BAY FLORIDA
SIR, Your communications of the 7" instant have been received.”
My letter of the 12" instant” will fully advise you of the views of
this department with respect to the claims to negroes.
Five thousand dollars more will immediately be remitted to you,
which will make in all that has been sent to you the sum of fifty five
thousand, the amount which it appears from your letter you require.
You are authorized to take as many of the rifles at Tampa as may
be necessary to enable you to comply with your promise to furnish
one to each warrior, but they must by no means be distributed till
after the Indians reach their destination in the West.
The department is anxiously waiting intelligence that you have
succeeded in shipping off the greater portion, or all, of the Indians
who have come in at Tampa."

SIR, Yours of the 6th instant has been received,” and the informa-
tion it communicates of the number of Seminoles about to be trans-
ported to their Western homes, and of the probability of an additional
number being soon ready for the same destination, is gratifying.
There was sent, from this office, on the 6th of February, for removal
of Indians, to General Armistead $20,000"—on the 10th to Captain
Page (which he informs the Department has been turned over to you)
$10,000,"—On the 19th to General Armistead $25.000"—and on the
26th of the same month to the same officer $25.000.”—the two last
sums being part of the appropriation made at the late session of Con-

They relate to negro slaves held by Indians and to funds necessary to comply

gress; to enable the General to comply with the engagements he made
with the Indians in his efforts to negotiate with them. I take it for
granted that all this money was received, soon after your letter was
written, as I have had advice that some of it was.
The suggestions made by you have been considered, and the Secre-
tary of War has directed that Major J. Clarke, Quarter Master U.S.A.
stationed at New Orleans, he should receive the Seminoles, as they
may arrive at that city, and forward them with the least delay prac-
ticable to their destination in Arkansas, A copy of the communica-
tion to him, of this date, is enclosed.
You will be pleased, therefore, to remain in Florida, and to send the
Indians from Tampa, as fast as they may be in readiness to go, under
the Superintendence of General Armistead, and charge of the Gentle-
man he has designated to see them safely and comfortably emigrated.
So far as regards the finding of them on the voyage, whether by the
purchase of provisions to be issued to them on the voyage, or by con-
tract with the Captain of the boats to furnish them with rations as
well as transportation, which must necessarily be left to your discre-
tion, in which you will consider the state of the market, the prices
asked, and the comfort and kind treatment of the Indians, to con-
ciliate whom is a prime object—that may have an important bearing
on the pacification of Florida.
Estimates of funds that may be required from time to time, certified
and recommended by General Armistead, as the Superintendent of
the emigration, will be forwarded when wanted, and the money will
be remitted without delay. In the disbursements you will make, I
cannot enjoin too great a regard for economy, up to the limit which
shall not interfere with the good treatment we at all times owe In-
dians, but which policy especially dictates in this instance.
You will forward to this office copies of all contracts you may
make, under the direction of General Armistead, Superintendent &"”

learn that there are about 300 Indians “now ready for transportation,
and there is a very strong probability that there will be more in the
course or twelve or fifteen days. He states the expense of transporta-
tion at about 8 dollars per head, -supplies being furnished by the
Commissary's department, —from Tampa to New Orleans—He is
unable to estimate the expense from New Orleans to their homes in
Arkansas—but recommends in the strongest manner the stationing
of an agent at New Orleans to receive the parties as they arrive, and
provide for their immediate removal West from that City. In pro-
curing boats for this purpose it is thought to be of great consequence,
on the score of both convenience and economy, to take such measures
as will prevent any change of boats from New Orleans to the point of
destination.
The Secretary of War has designated you to attend to this duty at
New Orleans, and the necessary letter will be written by his direction
from the Quarter Master General on the subject. You will, therefore,
please to give it your best attention, and I am assured from the past
official intercourse I have had with you, that it will be well performed.
As to provisioning or finding the Indians on the voyage, you will
exercise your best discretion, and determine from your knowledge
of the markets and other circumstance, which must enter into con-
sideration, whether it will be most economical and most conducive to
the comfort of the Indians, to contract with the boats that shall be
necessary to transport and subsist them on the trip, or to contract for
transportation only, and purchase provisions to be issued to them by
the conductor or Superintendent on the way. It is very important
to impress these people favourably—and to produce this effect must
be a leading object, which you will keep steadily in view.

and assistant Surgeon Barnes were also assigned to this duty, the
former to be relieved on reaching New Orleans.

any occasion you should find it necessary you are authorized to draw

SIR: I have the honor, to report nothing of importance has tran-
spired since my last communication—I have just returned from
Sarasota: I went there with Co-a-coo-che or Wild-Cat. I thought
it advisable to take him there to see and converse with the Indians
there, as some of them were his connexions; from that point he sent
a runner to Sam Jones, to meet him at a point selected, about the
8th inst—he promises very fair and says he will bring Sam Jones
with him, if he can be got in. It will be about the 10th or 15 of next
month before he can collect his people and come in (so he says).
He assured Cotsar and Ho-the-la-poyer, two of the deligation and
his own brothers that he would surely come in. Wild Cat and Cotsar
are devoted to each other; but we have been taught here to believe
a thing, when we see it, and not before. Cosa Tus-te-nug-gy the
2"Chief of the Mick-a-suckies is in with most of his people—he has
sent for Helick-Tus-te-nug-gy to come in, the runners have not yet
returned—
There are at this place about 150 persons, and 100 at Sarasota I
have sent two runners to the Okee-cho-bee to ascertain what time
Hosper-tarkee (the head man of those at Sarasota) will be in, with
the balance of his people, so soon as he arrives I shall ship those
to New Orleans, if not prevented. Cosa-tus-tenuggy says if Helick
does not come in, he wishes to be off very soon. They are so slow
to operate with, it is fatigueing to wait on them, but, policy requires
us to be patient.
If Wild Cat does not come in by the middle of next month as he
promises, I shall think the deligation have done all they can do,

SIR I have the honor to report I arrived here this day with
Eighty eight Seminoles from Sarasota Bay thirty warriors and the
balance women and children. I remained at this Point some days
till a runner went to Hos-per-tar-keys Camp to ascertain for a
certainty if he was comeing, but on his arrival there, he discovered
he had cleared out with what few People he had—I then determined
to bring all to this place, and unite them with those at this place
for emigration—I presume they will start about the 5th of May, I
shall urge the General to ship them—it will be about the 10th of
next month before the time arrives Coo-a-coo-che appointed to come
in; some have confidence in his comeing in, I see but little to encourage
that belief, there are also some other runners out that are expected
in shortly—
I think by the 15th of May we can tell if negotiation is at an end—
We have now in camp about 225 Indians ready to ship—Capt Bell
with a Company of Dragoons went in pursuit of the bands that
murdered the express man and burnt the Mail, he came across them
just at night and succeeded in killing Wax-E-Harjo one of the mur-
derers, and found all the express mans cloths and Watch-chain, and
several letters and pieces of letters in the Camp he routed him,
there was only four or five men in the Camp, but no women, I presume
this was only a temporary camp—
This Wax-E. Harjo is a sub-chief of Cosa Tustenuggy who is now
here, he declined comeing in, when Cosa came, and has been sent
for by Cosa, but would not come, he put himself to the head of a
small party of Cosas people, that remained, he having been killed
and hung upon a tree in his own Camp will have a good effect Cosa
thinks it will have the desired effect, to induce others to come in, a
little time will test it and I will give you the earliest intelligence
With respect I have the honor to be your obt servt.

SIR I have the honor to report that I have personally inspected
the condition of the 1* Infantry, stationed at Fort Armistead, and
find the post untenable on account of sickness, there being at the
time of my visit, more than two hundred on the sick report. A
portion of the sick were immediately removed to the General Hospital
at Cedar Keys, and the remainder of the regiment will follow at
once and occupy one of the islands at Cedar Keys, where it is pre-
sumed they will recover and preserve their health.
I extremely regret the necessity of abandoning the position at
Sarasota—It is much nearer than Tampa to the bands on Pease
Creek and in the Big Cypress, and served as a rallying point for
those who were desirous of coming in. There is no post south of
this which could be occupied at this season without great risk to the
troops.
The Indians now ready for shipment will be detained until the 7"
instant, in consequence of information that sixteen more would be in
by that time. An escort and wagons have been sent to Fort Foster *
to conduct this party in, and when they return, the whole will be
shipped to their destination.
Coacoochee" and Halick Tustenuggee" are not yet in and may
not come in at all, at present. I have direct information that their
desire is to go to Arkansaw in the Autumn. We can judge of this

And since the country north of Tampa will shortly be free of Indians, the military

by their remaining quiet during the summer. No forays have been
made upon the settlements for some months, which augurs well for
the general peaceable intentions of the Indians. I entertain no
doubt that peaceful negotiations will bring this war to an end much
sooner than uncertain and unsuccessful scouting through the swamps
and hammocks.
On the 28" ult” the express between Fort Annuteliga * and this
place was killed by Indians & the mail almost wholly destroyed. As
soon as the intelligence was brought in by a friendly Indian, Captain
Beall was ordered in pursuit, & by a prompt and energetic movement
which is highly creditable succeeded in finding one of the hostile

“with copies of plats, field notes, and such other papers as will aid
him in the discharge of the duties entrusted to him” and in relation
to which you have directed that the proper instructions be given to
those Officers.
I beg leave to represent the fact that the transcribing of plats &
field notes, (the former being the appropriate duty of a draughtsman)
has never been regarded as other than extra Official duty when re-
quired of any of the local Land Officers and for which they would
certainly expect to be compensated from some source; and under the
presumption that the Navy Department may have at its disposal a
contingent fund which would cover the object, I would respectfully
suggest the propriety of an understanding with that Department in
reference to the matter of compensation, before any definite instruc-
tion be given through the medium of this Office.
This suggestion is made in view of the fact that services have al-
ready been required of the land Officers at S*Augustine of a charac-
ter which they deem extra Official and for which they have an unset-
tled claim for compensation, that I have not as yet thought proper
to bring to your notice.
In connection with this subject I would remark that the emoluments
of the Land Officers at S" Augustine, (averaging for the last two
years, little over six hundred dollars a year) precludes the possibility
of their employing a Clerk on this service.
In case however the Navy Department should not have at its dis-
posal a contingent fund to meet the object, it occurs to me that it
would greatly facilitate the accomplishment of the purpose intended,
were the Agent furnished by the Navy Department with a supply of
“tracing paper,” (so called) which would enable him to take off hand
sketches, extracts or perfect copies of any maps or portions of maps
required from time to time."

JOSEPH S. SANCHES Marshal of East Florida, Saint Augustine, East
Florida.
SIR, It having been made known to this Department, that certain
individuals have, without authority and to the detriment of the public
interests, built upon and otherwise occupied portions of the public
lands at and near Saint Augustine, under the control of this Depart-
ment, you are hereby required, by direction of the President, to
proceed under the provisions of the Act of March 3° 1807, entitled
“An Act to prevent settlements being made on lands ceded to the
United States until authorized by law”,” to remove these persons
and their property from the lands they have occupied.
Before commencing the execution of this duty, you will consult
with the District Attorney, the Officer in command of the district,
and Lieut. Benham, of the Corps of Engineers, from whom you will
ascertain the limits of the land from which the intruders are to be
removed, and also what portions thereof, having been occupied under
proper authority, are to be exempt from proceedings under these
instructions. You will then satisfy yourself of the shortest period
within which these persons can make their arrangements for removal,
with the least possible injury or loss, and having explained to them
the instructions you have received, the measures you are authorized
to take for their execution, and your want of discretion in the matter,
you will require them to remove within the time you may have de-
termined upon, and await its expiration, before taking any further

steps. Should a military force unfortunately be necessary to enable
you to carry these instructions into effect, you will call upon the
Officer in command of the district, who will be instructed to comply
with your requisition. It is believed, however, that the intruders
will retire quietly and peaceably on receiving the representations
you are requested to make; but, in any event, you are directed to
exercise towards them as much consideration and delicacy, as may
be consistent with the due execution of the duty hereby assigned

SIR:—I am sorry to say, that the President has deemed it his
imperative duty, to make a change in the office which you hold, and
to which you have been so recently appointed.”
The murder of Gen. Read at Tallahassee,” apparently perpetrated
with so much deliberation of purpose, is calculated to produce very
strong excitement. The President is not disposed at present to form
any unfavorable opinion of your conduct, or the conduct of those
who appear to be among your friends; but he thinks it absolutely
indispensable, that the trial of the accused should be conducted in
such a manner as to leave no possible ground of suspicion in the
public mind that justice will not have its due course;—indeed he
takes it for granted that it would be your own wish, under existing
circumstances, not to be called on to perform the important duties
of Marshal on this occasion.
You will please, therefore, deliver to your successor whatever
papers and other things [you may have in your possession?]" belonging
to the office, when he shall present you this letter."

which is in direct violation of the implied usage which has regulated
the election of Delegates, since the passage of the ordnance for the
Government of the North Western Territory, and which has since
served as the basis of such qualification and requirement.—
In calling your attention to the fact that the said David Levy
is not a citizen of the United States nor ever has been, -they submit
the following facts,That the said David Levy was born in the Island
of St Thomas in the West Indies, on the second day of June A D
1810.” That the said Island is a Danish possession. That the
said David Levy has never even applied for letters of Naturalization
but has continued to live in this Territory since the year 1829 undi-
vested of the allegiance due by him to his sovereign the King of
Denmark, and retains still his subjection to a foreign power. That
the said David Levy claims to be a citizen of the United States by
virtue of a supposed right of Citizenship extended to his father Moses
E Levy; that the said right was incomplete and illegal and in express
violation of the acts of Congress regulating the naturalization of
Foreigners.—That the said right failing on the part of the Father
and claimed by the Son, his equally void; and that Moses E. Levy
and David Levy his son are now the subjects of a Foreign Power
and are not Citizens of the United States.
Protesting therefore against the Violation of the rights and privi-
leges due us as Citizens of the United States, we remonstrate against
the said David Levy an Alien being allowed to take his seat in your
honorable body as the Delegate from Florida, and pray that a new
election may be ordered "–

If Helick comes, we shall expect Co-a-coo-che—Colonel Worth
with one hundred men went south to the Car-loo-sa-hatch-ee in a
steam boat with the deligation, and other Indians that were detained,
as guides to get an interview with Sam Jones if possible; we have
not heard from him since he left; we have but little to hope for in
that section at present-
Our only hope at this moment rests with Helick—Capt Bell is
on a scout with one hundred Dragoons and in the vicinity of the
warmsprings, I am fearful he will come across these people and scatter
them, if so, it will be a long time before they could be collected—It
was well known these people were collecting, to come in, and I re-
quested him not to molest them if he came across them
I shall hope to report favourable on the last day of this month
With respect I have the honor, to be Your obt servt.

To the Honorable the Senate of the United States.—
The memorial of the undersigned, citizens of Apalachicola, respect-
fully calls the attention of your honorable body to the distressed
condition of their City, and craves permission to suggest the means
by which your honorable body may afford them relief.—
The undersigned respectfully represent themselves as merchants,
constituting the chief portion of this community, and forming the
channel through which the commerce of the country on the Apalachi-
cola River and its tributaries is negotiated.—Their city is the centre
of a trade on the gulf of Mexico, inferior in its importance, in both its
foreign and domestic relations, only to that of New Orleans & Mobile,
and whose prosperous or adverse condition promotes or obstructs
the prosperity of large portions of the Territory of Florida and the
states of Georgia and Alabama.—Your memorialists respectfully
represent that there welfare, as well as that of the region connected

with them in business, is intimately dependant upon the existence
of a sound monied circulation. They further respectfully represent
that there is no solvent or specia paying bank in the Territory, and
that in consequence, there is an entire absence of a sound currency
and the means of effecting internal exchanges but at ruinous losses,
that from the operation of this cause, their industry has been paralized,
their credit impaired, and their whole community, which has, until
recently, been characterised as active, enterprising and prosperous,
has sustained a blight rendering them incapable of carrying on
business.—
From this state of distress and desolation, your memorialists re-
spectfully represent that they can look to no possible source of relief
but in your honorable body confirming the act of the Legislative
Council of Florida, passed on the tenth day of February in the year
1837, establishing a bank in the City of Apalachicola, intitled the
“Marine Insurance Bank of Apalachicola”, and appointing Hiram
Nourse, Hiram W. Brooks, George L. Middlebrook, John Gorrie,
Thomas L. Mitchell, Henry R. Taylor, John D. Howell, Oliver C.
Raymond, Elizur Wood and Austin Williams, commissioners for re-
ceiving subscriptions to, and distributing the stock of said Bank.—
Your memorialists respectfully represent that they fully believe
the crisis which they have reached, calls for the granting to them a
charter for a bank, as the only means of restoring the commerce and
productive industry of their City, and they trust that the representa-
tion which they have made of the actual condition of their affairs,
and their great want, will induce your honorable body to revive their
hopes and stimulate their energies by a grant of their prayer—and
as in duty bound, your memorialists will ever pray.—

be retained in the hands of the United States.—It is also expedient
that a certain extent of adjoining ground—enough to prevent the
too near approach of private buildings and the masking the fire of
the battery—Should be regarded as part of the Site.—There is not,
however, on the map transmitted by the Commissioner of the Land
Office, the information necessary to an accurate designation of the
tract that should be reserved—If the town of Fernandina is not, as
would appear on the map, occupied by any private claims, it will be
easy to specify boundaries for the reservation—but as this can hardly
be the case, it would seem advisable to seek more information.—I
would therefore suggest that application be made to the Surveyor
General, in the expectation that he may furnish a map exhibiting
the position, in relation to the fort, of all the private claims adjacent
and near.
The papers referred by you are herewith returned."—

TO THE PRESIDENT
SIR Upon your Suggestion and permission of this morning, I take
the liberty of Stating that Charles Downing the late delegate from
Florida (where I have resided for the last Seven years) has lost his
re-election principally from the fact that the Loco Foco Office Holders
of East Florida, have not been removed.
Let me specify for St. Augustine–Antonio Alvarez, Keeper of the
Public Archives—and Mayor of St. Augustine! John Rodman, Loco
foco Collector of the Customs, imported from New York years ago,
to aid in disseminating Van Burens principles & tactics—Joseph S
Sanches, U.S. Marshall, and a Senator in the local Territorial Council
of Florida, by “election” of locofocos' Col. Cole of Virginia, Receiver
of Public Monies, sent to us for political effect, & to keep us in the
Van Buren harness.
Col: Dill—Collector at Jacksonville, E. Florida, & Past Postmaster
at Jacksonville & J. M. Fontane, Interpreter, at St Augustine—all
the above, have been, & were, in the recent delegates elections, active
& leading & interfering politicans! Some of them, the U.S. Marshall
& Territory Senators, for instance, made public proclamations on the
day of election. That Downing had tried his best to turn him out &
* House Journal, 27 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 169,349. The first report of the Com-
mittee on Elections, which was tabled, was adverse to the right of Levy to hold
his seat; the text of the report, with accompanying documents, is printed in H.
Exec. Doc. 10, 27 Cong., 1 sess. A list of persons who took the oath of naturaliza-
tion at St. Augustine, May 20, 1822, is embodied in the report. Further docu-
mentation is found loc. cit., 27 Cong., 3 sess., No. 15, series 419. The original
papers relating to the contested election in question are found in NA(HF 27 Cong.,
27 A - D 6-2.) See also House Journal, 27 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 101, 155, 221, 235,

Asher L. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives (Washington, 1907),
Vol. I, sections 422 and 423, comments on the issue in question. Although no
formal action was taken by the House, Levy was permitted to take his seat
despite factional appeals late in 1842 that the case be reopened. In this con-
nection, see report of the Committee on Elections, Mar. 15, 1842 (Cong. Globe,
27 Cong., 2 sess., p. 320), which affirmed the contention that Levy was a citizen
of the United States at the time of his election. The report was tabled. Debate
in the House on the general question of Levy's eligibility is found ibid., 3 sess.,
pp. 48, 53–54. Cf. post, p. 355.

The interference of these U.S. Officers in our election has been gross

But Sir—it is not too late to aid the cause of “correct principles”
with us—David Levy the loco foco who has Succeeded—running be-
tween Downing & Wade (Whigs) is absolutely an Alien! & it will so be
shown to Gongress the H. of Representatives and he cannot take his
Seat! 97
I feel confident that a new election will be ordered by the House—
And most respectfully & earnestly would I beg leave to urge upon
your Administration, the turning out of the Officers Specified who
continue to brave public opinion by their gross interference with the
freedom of elections.

Port of St. Augustine, if it Should be thought that my appointment
would best promote confidence & the ends of the Public Service.

Occasional instances of outrage may, nevertheless, occur—for, a
very small party of savages, even one or two individuals, with their
habits of eluding observation, and rapidity of flight, may defeat, to
some extent, the best dispositions that can be made of the whole
force in Flordia; but the employment of a large additional force

sustain the supremacy of the laws.
A Mr Wilson has just informed the Governor that if I shall undertake
to exercise the duties of Marshall before M Walker shall have an
opportunity to vindicate himself against the charges preferd against
him, that my life shall be the forfeit, The Gov, is so much alarm'd
that he insists on my taking up Lodgins at his house, but I have re-
solved to stand my ground, & not yield an inch, I am satisfied that
the whole gang are a set of cowards, & that nothing is to be feard
from an open attack from any one of them,
Alston told me to day in the Presence of the Governor that he had
heard from Washington, that a Col. Camp had been sent on here
who car'd not for dirks, Pistols, Rifles, or Bowie Knives, But he
may find his match, I replied—that I was at a loss how he could come
by any such information when he replied that he went to the P. Office
last night & found a letter directed to Miner Walker, & P. Mark"

goverment that entire justice shall be done to all, & that so far as I
have any agency in that, or any other business, I shall be governed
by the strict rule of Justice, with mildness, but at the same time with
firmness
I understand that some twenty of the friends of Alston will be in
from the country tomorrow, with what view & for what purpose is
only conjecture; some dozen gentlemen of this city of high respecta-
bility have this moment sent only a note to Dr English & in the most
respectful manner tendering to me their services, & if necessary their
lives in support of the Law, the fact is there is material in this country
for the best society, & if only some ten or fifteen blacklegs, & des-
peradoes were driven out of the country, no people in the U. S.
would enjoy better society, But the truth is, the people are afraid
of these desperate fellows, & they know it, & therefore keep them in
fear *

HON: N. P. TALLMADGE
SIR, I trust my addressing you may not be deemed indelicate on
account of a very slight acquaintance; but presuming on your knowl-
edge of many of my relatives, and a friendship I believe with the late
Co' Samuel Hawkins my father, I take the liberty of asking your
good services for procuring me the Office of District Attorney of the
Middle District of Florida.—In asking your Co-operation in this
matter, I feel somewhat emboldened by the strong recommendations
of my friends in Florida some of which are on file in the Department
of State and in the possession of the President, and I am proud to add,
that the bar generally have given their testimonials in my behalf.—
It is thought, that the present incumbent will be removed—The
state of society at Tallahassee owing to the recent murder of General
Reed is very unsettled and the greatest excitement pervades the Com-
munity, owing to the fact, that the friends of Reed and Alston, his
murderer, are in array against the other—The public demand as well
as the crisis, a man of fearlessness in the discharge of duty, for threats
of a sanguinary nature have been made against those who prosecute,
based on the account by S. M. Martin, Fla. During Terr. Days, pp. 106–107. The
murder of Read is also described in Tallahassee, The Floridian, May 1, 1841.
According to the article in question, Alston secreted himself in the home of Michael
Ledwith, and as Read passed by Alston stepped out and shot him twice with a
double barrel gun loaded with slugs and small pistol bullets. A jury brought in
a verdict of wilful murder. See post, p. 346. In succession to Read, Charles H.
Dupont was nominated brigadier general of militia, Dec. 30, 1841, and confirmed,
Feb. 11, 1842 (Senate, Exec. Journal, VI, 8, 26). Gen. Samuel Parkhill was rec-
ommended by Gov. Call to succeed Read in a letter to the Secretary of
War, Apr. 28, 1841 (NA, WD, SW Reg. of Lets. Recd., F 69). Del. Levy rec-
ommended Col. William J. Bailey (Pres. to the Secretary of War, June 30, 1841,

and my friends claim for me that essential requisite at this juncture
for the Office.—
The fact, that I have been several times elected to our Legislature
and elected President of our Senate, I trust can be quoted as evidence
of my standing and reputation without rendering myself amenable to
the charge of vanity—
Our late Delegate Downing, who takes a warm interest in my be-
half, has been beaten owing to the whigs running two Candidates,
and a M. Levy, a rank loco foco, succeeds him.—
It is needless to say, that I have always been Conservative in my
political feelings and am now an adherent of the present administra-
tion. We hope to enter the Union, as soon as this disastrous Indian
War is brought to a close, and we hope to give three electoral votes
to the party in power at the next election, for there is a strong whig

JOHN G. GAMBLE TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:SD, Applics. and Recomds.:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE June 9* 1841
DEAR SIR Confident that elevation to the highest earthly honor
has not changed the man, I will continue to address you with the
honest frankness of a friend.
You will see that the removal of Minor Walker from the Office of
Marshal of the district has given great dissatisfaction here, to the
friends of the administration—and the feeling is aggravated by a
knowledge of the influence by which it has been effected—The in-
fluence of one, whose territorial politics have been the worst kind of
loco focoism; and whose conduct, throughout the progress of the
feud which has at length resulted in the death of Gen' Leigh Read,
has been that of either a bad, or a mad-man.
It is understood that Mr Walker has been removed from office, in
* See post, p. 514.

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 331
consequence of representations of Governor John Branch *—and
they have been of a character to convince you that immediate action
was indispensible—you would not else have dismissed an officer, so
recently appointed by President Harrison, without an opportunity
of being heard in his defense. Of the falsehood of any charge against
Minor Walker requiring his dismissal, his friends cannot doubt—And
I pray leave to warn the administration to be cautious how they lend
credence to any information from this quarter, which is not vouched
by persons entitled to, and possessing its confidence.
You Sir can form no idea of the effrontery with which falsehood is
invented, and propagated here by the unprincipled crew, congre-
gated hereabout under the patronage of the late federal and territorial
administrations. Not a particle of truth is required as the sub-
stratum of Mountains of falsehood. I could adduce a dozen examples
referring to the death of Gen' Read; and will take the liberty of men-
tioning two, which have most probably been retailed in Washington.
The first was told me by Col” Williams the Son in law of Gov. Branch,
& I am sure was then believed by him. It charged, that Minor Walker
then newly appointed to supercede Gen' Read as Marshal, had made
an appointment to meet the latter at the Court House in this City,
on Monday the 26" April, for the purpose of receiving from him the
papers pertaining to the Marshals Office—and that notice of the ap-
pointment was given by Walker, to Willis Alston, who thereupon
stationed himself on the premises, whence he shot Read. Walker
therefore was an accessory to the homicide.
As I had recommended Mr Walker to the Sec of State I felt it
my duty to enquire into the truth of this charge; and learned that
M. Walker arrived in Tallahassee in the Stage, returning from Wash-
ington, on friday evening 23 April—that on Saturday morning he
left town early, & went to his home some 15 or 18 miles north east of
this City—he remained there with his family the remainder of that
day, & Sunday—that he had no communication directly or indirectly
with Read, & made no appointment to meet him, on Monday, or
any other day—and consequently could not have informed Alston
of the intended meeting. That on Monday morning, in company
with some of his neighbours, who came bye on their way to Tallahassee,
he set out for this City; and when within a few miles of town, they
met a man who gave the information that Read had been kill shot
that morning, by Alston—M" Walker had not “qualified” as Marshal,
and could not have received a transfer of the papers of the Office, if he
had met Read—nor did he become the Marshal of the district until
12 Of North Carolina.

the day after Reads death. By request of the Coroner (the sheriff
of the County being then in jail for shooting a man) Walker consented
to act as his assistant, or Bailiff, in arresting Alston, taking him before
Judge Allen, & detaining him as a prisioner, until, he had taken the
oath of office, & until the jail was ready.
The other example, relates to Gen Call; and I select it, because
it is understood that efforts are being made, to procure his removal.
A respectable gentleman informed me, that on the day on which Read
was shot, he went to the Court house to witness the examination then
going on before Judge Allen—that he went in company with an ac-
quaintance belonging to the loco foco party-that after standing
together, & listening to the testimony for some time, they left the
Court House together; and his amazement was extreme, at hearing
his companion, soon after, narrate to a crowd, that while he was
attending the examination Governor Call came into Court & prof-
fered to bail Alston. Need I add that Call did not go to the Court
House; or that the whole story was an impudent fabrication?
You will have been apprized, that before M Walker was superceded
here, by Major Camp, Willis Alston had been released from jail, and
admitted to bail—whether by the rightful authority, is a much
disputed point.
As an Officer, I think M Walker possessed qualifications par-
ticularly suited to this region, & certain portions of its population
with great self possession, & suavitee of manner he is a man of un-
doubted firmness—not one who talks about pistols, dirks and Bowie
knifes—such ornaments, form no part of his wardrobe, as means of
enforcing submission to law—Without any such auxilliaries, I would
rely upon him, for putting down resistance to lawful authority, sooner
than almost any man in the Country.—The wearing of pistols, bowie
knives &c by officers of justice has become so common since loco foco
ism got possession of the reins of government here, that Walkers re-
fraining from their use looks somewhat like Affectation. His prede-
cessor, Read, was always armed to the teeth—the loco foco sheriff
of the County does the same, and recently shot, & killed a poor
drunken man, whom he accosted for making a noise in the Street-
some silly boys persuaded the man to take to his heels, which he did,
& was arrested by a ball from the Sheriffs pistol. The Sheriff was
arrested, confined a few days in jail; & having given bail is now in
the performance of his Official duties.—It is probable that Governor
Branch may have exhibited Affidavits sworn to by before the Editor
of our loco foco gazette—a judge whose pistols are always conspicuous
on his person, whether on, or off the bench—and who escaped the
penalty of an law against wearing “concealed weapons,” by the sage

decision of Judge Balch, that pistols & Bowie knives, worn so as
to be seen, did not come under the meaning of the Statute." I
mention these things by way of episode—they will be new to you.
I will only add in relation to them that these Characters are all the
political friends of Governor Branch—foisted upon this Community
when loco-foco ism held the reins—and the time has not yet come
when Gov” Call could, legally, put better men in their places. If
the government has been induced to believe that the removal of
Walker was necessary for the purposes of justice, in bringing Willis
Alston to trial for the killing of Read, there has been a remarkable
want of discretion in arranging matters here. Major Camp, the
successor of Walker, has come here, apparently consigned to the
friends of Read. He takes up his residence at the house of Col”
Williams, the brother in law of Read, and son in law of Gov. Branch—
and the members of the family of Governor Branch are the sureties
of the new Marshal.
If for the purposes of justice, it was necessary to guard against
any supposed, or possible bias on the part of the Marshal in favor
of the prisoner, is it not of vastly greater importance, that there
should be no possible ground to suspect an influence, and bias operat-
ing against him? Nevertheless from the circumstances mentioned,
which I knew believe to have been accidental, an impression will
go abroad, that the Government of the U States has lent itself to
the gratification of the revengeful feelings of the friends of Gen.'
Read; and the matter planned to ensure the conviction of Alston—
and that to secure his execution, Governor Call will also be removed.
M Websters mind will readily suggest the use which skilful Counsel
will make of such materials for defense—And when added to the usual
protections afforded a prisoner in peremptory Challenges, & chal-
lenges for Cause, can he think it would be possible to find a jury
which will convict Alston? Or that his execution could follow,
without hazard of resistance, & bloodshed? And altho' every man
of Correct thinking, will unhesitatingly condemn, and invoke justice
to punish Alston, it does not follow, that in the minds of many the
killing of Read (except as to the manner) is not either justified, or
palliated, by many of the prior occurrences.—I think the chance
of a conviction hopeless. And I think too that he will never be
brought to trial, for I have only this moment learned that a new
warrant for his arrest has been issued, & that some 50 or more men,
have gone in pursuit. If a majority of those fifty, have not gone

with determination to kill him, I am deceived. Twenty four hours
more, will probably decide whether the man of Blood, has not met
a bloody end.
In the early part of this letter I made allusion to the conduct of
Gov. Branch in relation to the feud, prior to Read's death. The feud
commenced at the election in Oct. 1839, in a rencounter between Read
& Doc' Tradewell, both being Candidates before the people—from
beginning to end, it was a private feud; and up to the time of his
killing Col” Augustus Alston in a duel, in all its phases, & stages,
Read was outrageously the aggressor. The feud never had more of
party complexion, than that the individuals belonged to different
political parties. But from the beginning, Governor Branch has
striven to represent, and to make it a party feud. He has at different
times insulted the whole Whig party with the charge of endeavoring
to compress the death of his son in law, by instigating his personal
enemies to kill him—not contented with such general charges he has
at times directed them against the most respectable Citizens by
name–And I learn has even thought, or said, that a Bank was the
instigator.
It is not for me, in relation to future action by the high dignitaries
at Washington, to say more than suggest the enquiries, whether M"
Walker should not, even now, be furnished with the charges & specifi-
cations, preferred against him, and be heard in his defense? And if
acquitted in the Opinion of the government, whether he should not be
reinstated?
To my unsophisticated mind, such a course would greatly redound
to the honor of the Administration. And I have misunderstood
Major Camp, if he will not cheerfully relinquish, & receive the favors
of the Administration in another quarter.
If I knew how to pen one adequate to the Offense, I would present
an apology, for this long intrusion upon your time
May you live a thousand years!"

[NA:WD, SW, Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 23]
Department of War, WASHINGTON, June 10th 1841.
JOHN G. GAMBLE. Esqr. Tallahassee Florida.
SIR, The President has referred to this Department your letter of
the 27" ultimo," on the importance of paying the Florida militia
immediately &c.
The considerations you present in support of your views, are fully
appreciated, and the Department has already taken measures to have
all just claims against the United States liquidated without delay so
far as the subject is under its control.
From official reports, and from the records of the Department, it
appears that, except the militia of your Territory whose services were
regularly called for, there are none that can be paid, without a special
Act of Congress, but those ordered out by the Governor in 1840 whose
service was sanctioned by the late President in an order dated May 5"
1840." The greater part of these, it is believed, were continued in
service under General Read and have a balance of pay due them on
account of the latter service.
The appropriations made by Congress at the last session included
only part of the amount required for the Territorial service under the
order of the Governor, and made no provision for the payment of the
balance due for service under General Read; of course only a part of
each individual's claim, that the Board, ordered to investigate them,
has examined, can be paid until an additional appropriation is made.
The subject is now before Congress and it is hoped that, by the time
the Board has completed the investigation, a sufficient amount will
be appropriated to satisfy the claims; if not, they will be paid so far
as the funds now applicable will go.
Before the claims for supplies can be paid it is indispensably neces-
sary that they undergo a revision by the Accounting officers here, in
order that they may be compared with similar claims heretofore paid,
and be subjected to other precautionary tests to prevent the imposi-
tions that have so frequently been practised upon the Government, and
in consequence of which many fraudulent claims are supposed to have
been admitted. The revision of the claims here, will, it is believed,
consume but a short time; as the board will be directed to forward
each case as it is acted on, and as every effort will be made to despatch
them with all possible rapidity.

JOHN G. GAMBLE, Esqr. President of the Union Bank of Florida,
Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 24" ultimo," on the subject
of the loan made to the Territory of Florida, in the Fall of 1839, by
the Union Bank of that Territory, for the purpose of purchasing sup-
plies for militia called out for the defence of the country, and repre-
senting the great importance of an early repayment of the amount by
the General Government, which you consider bound for it.
The Department regrets that it cannot legally comply with your
wishes. No evidence can be found that it ever authorized or in any
way assumed or recognized the loan. The only arrangement it made
to relieve the Territory from the liabilities it incurred in calling
militia into service, without authority from the General Government,
was to cause the troops called out by the Governor in 1840 to be
afterwards mustered into the service of the United States, from the
period they entered that of the Territory. The Department thus
made itself liable for their pay and allowances, and for the claims for
supplies furnished them so far as they are authorized by the laws of
the United States. Whatever amount of these claims the Territory
may have properly paid, if any, and can legally be admitted at the
Treasury, will be withheld from the individuals and refunded to it on
the production of the proper proofs of payment. No payment can be
made by the Department but upon such proofs, and it would only be
in case of the assignment of these by the Territory to the Bank that
the amount to be refunded would be paid over to it."

Middle Florida," on account of representations of improper conduct
in the case of the Territory vs Willis Alston charged with the murder
of Leigh Read, and you request me to State all the facts within my
knowledge, relative to the arrest and commitment of Alston, as you
are desirous to lay before the President a true and full Statement of
the facts, that your conduct and character may be may be relieved
from unmerited aspertions.
About 11. Oclk in the morning of the 26" April, I was informed
that Willis Alston had Shot and dangerously wounded Leigh Read-
That a warrant had been issued and that Alston was then in custody—
That the Hon: Alfred Balch Judge of District was indisposed and that
it was the wish of the citizens generally that I should preside at the
hearing of the case as great excitement prevailed and a bloody con-
flict would probably ensue if the examination was had before justices
of the peace—That many persons were armed and threatening some
to shoot Alston and others to stand by him & prevent his arrest &c.
I immediately repaired to the Court House and sent for you—
You stated that you had not given Bonds and qualified; but expressed
a perfect willingness to to aid the Officer charged with the process—
The coroner to whom the Warrant for the arrest of Alston was de-
livered came to me and stated that Alston had sent for and volun-
tarily surrendered himself to him, and that Alston declared himself
willing to come before the Judge at any moment, but that he was
apprehensive that he would be shot down in the street the moment
he came out of the house. I directed the Officer to summon a suf-
ficient guard from among the citizens to prevent the escape of the
prisoner and also to protect him from violence.—The prisoner was
brought immediately before me at the Court house under an armed
guard—I directed that the doors should be open and the examination
should be public—That no person except the guard should be per-
mitted to enter the room with fire arms &c I have since understood
and indeed was informed during the progress of the examination
that the guard were friends of Alston and would as was suspected
rescue him should he be committed—I ordered an addition number
to be summoned by the Coroner—The persons however first summoned
conducted themselves throughout the examination with perfect
propriety so far as I could perceive—You however had nothing
whatever to do with summoning the guard on that day so far as I
know or believe—After the prisoner was brought in and the witnesses
were being examined you came and said to me that you were pre-
paring your bonds &c and wished to leave the Court House for that
purpose—I assented and requested you to be Sworn in as early as

possible—It was near dark when the examination closed—I was
about to write out a warrant of commitment when the Coroner ap-
proached my Seat and stated that the jail was not yet completed
that the county authorities had not received the building from the
undertaker, and that he fearing the house would be pulled down dur-
ing the night, positively refused to permit Alston to be confined in it—
The officer was then ordered to confine the prisoner in a close room
until the next day.—On the following day I delivered a warrant of
commitment to the Coroner—He then informed me that you had
been sworn in that morning—I told him in that case he could deliver
the warrant to you—At the same time the warrant was delivered a
requisition was made by me upon the Volunteer Copany of the
Town to hold themselves in readiness to obey the call of the executive
officer of the court—You however took the prisoner to jail without
the aid of the Malitia and without resistance or disturbance.
I have no hesitation in declaring that your conduct in the matter
so far as I know or believe was wholly blameless—I saw-he witnessed
nothing in your course in this matter which I am not fully satisfied
with the correctness of—I take this occasion to say that I have entire
confidence in the honor and integrity of your character as a man

Land Office here for such information as they could give me in regard
to the metes & bounds of the public reserves, & to obtain copies of
such maps as would aid me in the discharge of my duties; but I find

maps, & indeed, such is the indiffinite manner in which they were
necessarily described by the Agent making the selections before the
townships were surveyed that it is not possible to lay them down now
without their bounds being ascertained by actual survey.
You are aware that this Territory is dotted over in every part of it
with private grants from the Spanish Gov" some of which have been
confirmed, while some remain yet to be acted upon. The very indefi-
nite manner in which these are described, both in the original papers,
and in the decision of the court confirming them—sometimes the
tract being described as, say 1000 acres lying about two or three miles
from a given place, in a given direction—renders it utterly impossible
to enter them upon the township map.
Hence you will perceive the very great difficulty of sometimes
ascertaining whether a given tract of land is public & subject to be
entered or whether it is a reserve, or whether it is not covered by a
private grant, the more I examine into the subject the more I perceive
the almost inextricable difficulty in which the vague & indefinite
descriptions of the grant and decisions of the courts have involved
the subject, & which can only be remedied by actual surveys of the
reservations.
You will perceive from this that there are no maps to be copied,
unless indeed copies be taken of the very few upon which private
grants have been laid down as surveyed. But there are lists of private
grants confirmed & unacted on, with descriptions, such as they are,
of their localities, bounds &c, copies of which would be of great service
to the Agent & which he ought to possess. The expense of copying
these would probably be from forty to fifty dollars.

think an application for a donation of a Township of Land for the

From our natural position we are cut off Measurably from an
enjoyment of the advantages of Similar institutions located in other
States. So much So that they can only be enjoyed by a few of the
wealthiest of our Citizens, leaving the great mass of our female popu-
lation entirely dependent for an education on accident, for. it is a
Serious fact. that in this extensive Territory there is not a Single
institution so far as our knowledge extends where a man of moderate
Circumstances can place his daughter with a reasonable hope and
expectation tipen his leaving it, of having acquired even a tolerably
liberal english education—
Of the Advantages of education and the influence the female
portions have upon Society, and the rising generation it is useless
for us to dilate, especially to as intelligent a body as that of which
you are Composed, and which by its acts wields the destinies of our
Common Country—
If. “The General distribution Bill” passes,” being a Territory, we
presume we shall enjoy none of the benefits of it although a large
quantity of the finest Vacant lands in the United States lie within its
boundaries, and will be Sold for the benefit of our. Native States
(for which however we cherish a Strong affection) and we shall be
cut off from all hopes of ever deriving any benefit from that Source,
and be left to Struggle on as best, we can, which is ever a difficult
task in a new country where Capital is Scarce, and education is one
of the last and least Subjects to which mens minds can be drawn,
especially in a field offering so many subjects of speculation as Florida
does, and where as in every Section individual aggrandizement is apt
to be the ruling principle rather than the public weal.—

advantages we profess to possess lies in the Simple fact of possessing
the healthiest Site in Middle Florida, its Comparative remoteness
from the Scene of Indian depredations & the fact that persons from
all the Middle Counties & a portion of the Western Counties have
Sent their Children here to an ordinary School without a Single
death having occured among them for years past, and that the
general impression is that the Male College when located (for which
your Honorable body have already made provision) will probably
Centre here—in addition to this ours is not a Commercial mart
which certainly is greatly in favor of the morals and manners of
Schools being free from temptation
Harrassed as our Territory has been and probably will be for some
time to Come by the Hostile Indians, it is utterly out of the power
of our Territorial Government to assist us in the furtherance of our

Therefore to your our natural protectors we have alone to look
and throw ourselves upon your liberality and patriotism
We. Respectfully pray for the appropriation of a Township of
Land as the means of Endowing a Florida Female College at this
place, with Such checks upon the Trustees of said institutions as
you may think best for the faithful discharge of their duties—
As a Pledge for the faithful disposition of the funds to be Created
by this donation we stipulate that the interest only is to be appro-
priated exclusively to the Sustaining of the incidental expenses of
the institution, and that the Buildings for the Same Shall be erected
by a Subscription of our Citizens.
All of which is respectfully Submitted.

and Council of the Territory of Florida with an extract of a letter
from Mess” Gowan & Marx by whom these memorials were forwarded
to this country.
These Documents contain a Statement of the objects and wishes of
the memorialist and will explain the reason of their transmission to
your department
The General Government have always been so scrupulous in dis-
charging their admitted obligations that the memorialists cannot be
mistaken in believing they will take care that their dependencies shall
fulfill the contracts into which they have entered, especially as the
loans made upon their credit have actually been expended in the

the favor of your forwarding each to its proper destination in proper

sider that Congress acts as guardian to the Territory, and are in
some degree responsible for its acts. This view is more particularly
strengthened by the opinions set forth in the inaugural of your late
lamented President General Harrison. He says among the other
duties of a delicate character which the President is called upon to
perform is the Supervision of the Government of the Territories”
of the United States. This although more particularly relating to
the District of Columbia cannot be fairly applied to one territory
to the exclusion of other We therefore feel we have a greater claim
upon the interferance of the general government, when that Govern-

To His Excellency the Governor and the Honorable the Legislative Coun-
cil of the Territory of Florida.
The Undersigned being holders of Bonds of the Bank of Pensacola
guaranteed by the Territory of Florida beg leave respectfully to
represent to you that the Interest due 1" January last on said Bonds
has not been paid and from all the information they can collect they
fear that the Bank of Pensacola is not in a condition to pay it or the
future Interest that will become due. It becomes therefore necessary
for them to apply to the Government of the Territory of Florida
for payment of the same, as the Bonds have been purchased on the
good faith of the said Government (all of them being duly signed by
the Governor and Secretary) in reliance on which alone the Under-
signed have become holders of the Security and without which
guarantee the said Bonds could not have been negociated. And
they have entire confidence that on this representation the Govern-
ment will lose no time in taking such measures as will not only provide
for the Interest now due but also prevent any future irregularities
in the payment thereof.
With assurances of their high esteem they beg to subscribe them-

said Bonds are compelled to address themselves to the Government
of the Territory of Florida and from their confidence in the faith of

[LC: Pensacola Gazette, Aug. 7, 1841]
[June 16, 1841]
A PROCLAMATION BY THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.
WHEREAS, it has been satisfactorily made to appear to me, that
WILLIS ALSTON, who had been previously committed to the Jail
of Leon county, on the charge of murder, was on the fifth day of June,
of the present year, admitted to bail, and discharged by persons acting
as Justices of the Peace, and that he is now going at large. And
whereas it has been further made to appear, that the commissions of
the persons acting and admitting said Alston to bail, had expired, and
that they were not at that time aforesaid Justices of the Peace, and
that their acts as such, are therefore null and void.
Now, therefore, in pursuance of law, I hereby offer a reward of TWO
HUNDRED DOLLARS for the arrest of the said Willis Alston, and
his delivery to the Marshal of the Middle District of Florida. And
I do hereby direct all the proper officers of this Territory to be vigilant
in arresting said Alston and placing him in custody.

SIR. I have received your letter of the 4" ins** with copies of two
letters from Geo W. Cole Esq." Receiver at S*Augustine” & Colo Jos:
G. Totten Top. Engineer,” on the Subject of a proposed reservation
for public use at or near Fernandina on Amelia Island, and in answer
have the honor to report; in connection with the annexed Diagram of
the Surveys made on the North end of Said Island—that no informa-
tion of the scite of an old Fort, called San Carlos, or the precise location
of the Town of Fernandina is attainable from the records of this office,
nor yet from one of the Surveyors who has been consulted on the
Subject. The safe anchorage alluded to by Colo Totten I believe to
be in front of the redoubt and flag Staff laid down upon the Diagram
and I believe the town to be Situate on the north west point of the
Island within the private claim of the Heirs of John M*Queen—I give
you this information founded upon my recollection, having visited
that place in the year 1821 on my way to S' Augustine as Commis-
sioner to receive (under the Treaty) East Florida from the Spanish
authorities. I was then forcibly impressed with the indefensible
locality of that village and would now recommend a reservation at
the old redoubt to cover the anchorage; with Sections 8 and 11 on the
north, which are divided by a township line with a view to command
as far as practicable the entrance over the bar, the channel of which
I believe to be near the Florida Shore.

J. S. SANCHEZ, Esqr. Marshal of East Florida, Saint Augustine, East

SIR, Since the instructions of the 15" of May * were issued for the
removal of trespassers upon the military reserves at St Augustine,
representations have been made by Mr. P. S. Smith * and General
Hernandez, which have induced the Department to direct a partial
suspension of proceedings. You will therefore await further directions
from this Department before removing persons or property, from the
strip of land along the Northern boundary of the reserve to which
adverse claims are preferred.—With these exceptions you will proceed
in the execution of your instructions, exercising all the forbearance
and consideration recommended in my letter of the 15" ultimo.”
The representations above alluded to are to the effect, that the of-
ficers who were directed to point out to you the limits of the reserves,
are not in possession of the information necessary to the correct per-
formance of that duty; and this delay is directed, in order that the
Department may transmit to them such documents from the records

St. Augustine, and suggesting a referral of the matter to the Quartermaster Gen-
eral who has charge of the property there. The Secretary of War asked the
Commissioner of the GLO, June 17, 1841 (NA, GLO, Aband. Mil. Res. File,
Box 117), for a copy of the field notes of the lots and squares at St. Augustine,
reserved for military purposes under the Act of June 28, 1832. Thomas Douglas
reported to Joseph S. Sanchez, June 25, 1841 (NA, WD, CE Land Papers, Fla.),
his examination of land titles in “North City” possessed by individuals without
authority and detrimental to the public interest. He recommended three months
notice be given for chancery suits not disposed of during the July term and to be
brought to the September court. Joseph S. Sanchez in turn informed the Secre-
tary of War, July 2, 1841 (loc. cit.), that he had stopped all proceedings as di-
rected. Thomas Douglas reported to the Secretary of War, July 6, 1841 (loc.

GOVERNOR CALL TO HOPE AND COMPANY
[NA:SD, Misc. Lets.:C]
TALLAHASSEE 28* June 1841–
MESSRS HOPE & CO.
GENTLEMEN I am in receipt of your letter of the 11" Ult." written
in behalf of yourselves and other holders of Bonds, of the Pensacola
Bank, informing me that the Interest due on them the first of January
last has been refused and calling on the Government of Florida, to
redeem its pledges: by the payment of the Interest now due, as well
as to provide for the payment of that which may hereafter accrue.
It is admitted that the payment of the principal and Interest of the
Bonds above demanded, has been guaranteed by this Territory.
But she stands to the Bondholders in the relation only, of a remote
and contingent endorser, whose resposibility does not arise until after
the failure of the Bank of Pensacola, and its respective Stockholders,
who you will perceive by the amended charter of that Bank, are
individually bound in their private fortunes to pay both the principal
and Interest of these Bonds. Many of them are Gentlemen of very
large fortune residing in New York, Philadelphia and Louisiana, and
the laws of the respective States in which they live, will afford you
the most ample relief for their delinquency.
I have every confidence in the honour of this Territory & believe
she will in good faith redeem her resposibility when it shall have arisen,
but in the character of a remote endorser, she will exact due diligence
on the part of the Bond holders, in prosecuting their claims against
the Bank and the Individual Stockholders, who are first bound, and
who alone have had the advantage of the money, raised by the sale
of the Bonds. I would therefore recommend to you, and other
Bondholders to proceed at once, and without delay, by attachment
against the assets of the Bank of Pensacola, as well as by action
against the Individual Stockholders. I am induced to recommend
the process of attachment against the Bank, because I have reason to
believe that the Stockholders abroad are withdrawing the funds of
the Bank, beyond the jurisdiction of this Territory, and appropriating
them in a manner not authorized by the Charter. Should you be
disposed to persue this course, you will not be at a loss to find faithfull
agents here to protect your interest. I will myself with much pleasure
aid you in the selection of such as are competent and worthy of
confidence. You are sufficiently acquainted, no doubt, with your
rights, and the remedies which the law will give you against the Bank
and its Stockholders. But perhaps you are not so well, informed, of

the nature of the remedy you may have, against the Territory, should
its responsibility accrue, to the Bondholders—It is therefore proper,
that I should inform you, that, the Government of this Territory has
no power whatever, to pay, or to provide the means of paying, either
the principal or interest, on the Bonds which you hold, until authorized
so to do, by the Legislature—The Legislative Council of this Territory
meets annually on the first day of January, and holds usually a Session
of two months—Its members are elected by the popular voice, to
serve one Session only, except the Senate, which is elected to serve
two Sessions. No money can be paid out of the Treasury by the
Governor, for every purpose whatever without a special appropriation
by the two houses composing the Legislative Council. Not having
been informed of the delinquency of the Bank of Pensacola and its
Stockholders, in not paying the Interest due on their bonds, until
after the adjournment of the Legislative Council, on the 4th March
last, no provision was made for that purpose.
In January next at the meeting of the Legislative Council, the sub-
ject shall be fully submitted to that Body, for such action as it may
seem to them to require. Should the Legislature after viewing all the
ground, be disposed to pay the interest now due, and to provide for
the payment of such as may hereafter accrue, it must first create a
revenue for that purpose, by taxation, or otherwise, and make a special
appropriation of the fund. Thus you will perceive from the nature
of our Institutions, under the most favourable circumstances, you
would experience much delay and inconvenience, in obtaining redress
from the Territory, who can only be reached through the voluntary
act of the representatives of the people. You will therefore find it, I
apprehend, much more to your advantage, to procede at once against
those who are immediately liable to you in an action at law—After
the Bank of Pensacola, and its several Stock holders have been pro-
secuted to bankruptcy, should it then be necessary, I will use every
effort in my power to redeem the faith of this Territory, but you will
perceive from what I have already said, that the payment of any part
of the principal, or Interest, on these Bonds, must depend on the will
of the Legislature representing the people of Florida. Every possible
facility will be given you, by the Government of this Territory, in
prosecuting your claims against the Bank of Pensacola, and its Stock-
holders; and I have respectfully to request, that you will furnish me
with the names of all the endorsers on the Bonds which you hold.”

GOVERNOR CALL TO WILLIAM J. WORTH
[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., W 276:C*]
(Copy.) TALLAHASSEE 29* June 1841.
SIR, I have the honor herewith to enclose a copy of a letter which
I have addressed to Major Wilson of the United States Army,” rel-
ative to the exposed condition of Middle Florida. Apprehensive he
may not have authority, to adopt the suggestions I have made for the
defence of the settlements, I have thought proper to submit them for
your consideration, and ask that they may receive your early attention.
I assure you Sir, that the situation of this Country has never been
more exposed to the assaults of the enemy, at any period of the War,
than it is at the present time. There are but three Military Posts, and
these garrisoned by Infantry, for the protection of the whole line of
frontier extending from the Appalachicola river to the Suwanee, a
distance of one hundred & thirty miles. The country south of this line
to the Gulf of Mexico varying in depth from 20 to 130 miles, is almost
an entire wilderness, of which the Indians have undisturbed possession.
They are known to be prowling in the immediate vicinity of each of
the posts above mentioned, and the Troops, at least for some time
past, have not been able to give them the least disturbance. They have
with impunity robbed and murdered on the highway within eight
miles of Camp Gamble.” and although this occurrence took place
more than ten days since, and the Indians retreat from this scene of
havock, in considerable force, with mules, laden with plunder, leaving
a trail which might easily have been followed, up to the present time,
as I believe, nothing more has been done than to bury the dead. The
country south of the settlements, abounds with cattle, and the planta-
tions of the border being without protection, cannot fail to invite the
aproach of the Indians who it is known have been for some time past
engaged in driving cattle, from this section of the country, across
the Suwanee. Hitherto the attacks of the Indians have been confined
to the white population, and it has been owing to this cause principally
that, our planters have been enabled, to cultivate their crops and
carry them to market in safety. But the recent murder of the Negro
Wagon Drivers seems to indicate a different disposition on the part of
the Indians. It has created much alarm among the planters, and
if this mode of warfare is continued, it will cause the abandonment
of many of the large plantations on the frontier, which have stood as
a bulwark, against the advance of the Savages in our part of the
Country. My personal knowledge of the localities of Middle Florida,

enables me to speak with confidence of its exposed condition, and
enclines me to call on you as the Commander of the United States
forces in Florida for the necessary protection. Were I provided by
the Government with the necessary supplies, I should not do so, as
the people of the Country are able and willing, to defend themselves,
but without arms, ammunition, provisions & forage, they are unable,
and it cannot be expected of them, to hold the field against the common
enemy.
In East Florida my information is less accurate, but I have every
reason to believe that the inhabitants between the St. Johns and
the Suwanee are no less exposed to danger, than those to the West
of the last mentioned river. Several Murders were there committed
during the last month, and every mail brings me letters from respect-
able Citizens, informing me of the presence of the Indians, and the
peril to which the people are exposed. There is, I believe, no post
on the Suwanee above Camp Fanning,” and none between Micanopy
and the Ockafanoka Swamp. The Settlements are dispersed over
the intervening country and scarcely any where except at Newnans-
ville, sufficiently close, to be free from the danger of attack. There
are large sections of uninhabited country between all the settlements,
which afford hiding places for the Indians, from whence they can
attack the neighboring inhabitants, with as little apprehension from
the garrison at Micanopy, as they would entertain from the same
number of men at New York. Almost the only byway across East
Florida, which is travelled by persons going from the West, to St.
Augustine, is that from the Mineral Springs, on the Suwanee to
Jacksonville on the St. Johns. This road is entirely without pro-
tection, and although the houses upon it are frequently twenty five
or thirty miles from each other, and the Indians are known to infest
the Country through which it passes, necessity compels many of
our Citizens to travel it, though exposed to danger at every step.
I would therefore respectfully suggest, that a Post be garrisoned
by Mounted men of some description, should be established on this
road, at some convenient point, both for the protection of travellers,
and the sparse population of that Section of Country. I have further
to request that Fort White * & Fort Harley * may be reoccupied,
with a mounted force, to be kept actively employed in scouting the
neighboring Country and driving out the Indians.
I am fully aware, Sir, in the hardy enterprise in which you are
engaged, in prosecuting an active Campaign against the enemy,

you can have but little time to devote to the defence of an extensive
frontier, some hundred miles distant from the Scene of your opera-
tions. I have therefore taken the liberty of addressing you fully
on this subject, and as a Soldier, I doubt not my suggestions will
be received by you, in the same spirit in which they are made. I
am satisfied from the experience of the last five years, that Mounted
men alone can be efficient as a guard for the frontier settlements.
And I feel the utmost confidence in the belief that 600 well appointed
mounted men, enured as our people are to the climate and acquainted
with the Country, would give the most ample protection to the whole
frontier, from the St. Johns to the Appalachicola. The employment
of such a force would enable you to carry a much larger number
of Regular Troops to the Field, by which means you would much
sooner be able to bring the war to a close. Should you be disposed
to accept the Services of such a force it will afford me much pleasure,
to furnish them in Companies or Battallions, to be placed under
the command of such field Officers of the Army as you may designate.”

SIR, Your letter to the President of the 28* June,” having been
perused by him, has been transferred to this Department. The
popular violences as you describe them, perpetrated upon Capt
Cottrell, are such as strike at the foundations of all Law and order.
It is impossible to enjoy any security for life, liberty, or property, if
such outrages be overlooked; and the President directs me to give
a special instruction to yourself and other Law officers appointed
by this Government, to exert themselves fearlessly and to the utmost
of their ability, to bring offenders of this sort to condign punishment.
The protection of the peaceable and the innocent, and the general
welfare and reputation of the Territory, all require that the suprem-
acy of the Laws should be maintained, and no officer charged with
the duty of keeping the peace, or of prosecuting the violators, can
receive the President's approbation who shall be found guilty of
any degree of delinquency in this respect.

of the President, for the removal of intruders from certain public
lands at St Augustine, reserved for military purposes, and that the
Marshall of that District on proceeding to execute those instructions
had been served with a writ of injunction issued out of the Superior
Court of the Territory of Florida, upon the application & complaint
of individuals occupying & claiming portions of the same lands."
You are pleased to request my opinion “as to what extent the Mar-
shall is legally bound to defer the execution of the orders above men-
tioned while the injunction remains in force.”
The Court that granted this injunction was had competent juris-
diction, and that alone is sufficient to entitle its process to obedi-
ence–The court may, in this instance, have erred in the exercise
of its jurisdiction, but the Marshall is not judge of that—While
the writ of injunction remains in force, he is legally bound to obey
it, and to desist from the execution of the orders above mentioned,
exactly to the extent & requirement of that writ—It is scarcely
necessary to add that the injunction legally restrains the Marshall
only to the extent which it describes & specifies, and that it as to all
the lands embraced in the Presidents orders & not in the injunction,
it is the duty of the Marshall to execute those orders.

WASHINGTON CITY 24. July 1841.
TO THE HON THE SECRETARY OF STATE,
SIR I have to ask of your department that the “Apalachicola
Journal” newspaper be authorized to publish the laws of the United
States. This newspaper is published at the most important Sea
port town in Florida and indeed after New Orleans and Mobile the
most important on the whole of our Gulf Coast, as well in respect
of the revenue of the United States, as of commerce and trade gen-
erally. It will be perceived that the Laws of the U. States are at
present published only in Tallahassee & S* Augustine. In conse-
quence of the remoteness geographically of these places from each
other and from the South & Western parts of the Territory, and the
general irregularity of mail transportation, West Florida is deprived
almost entirely of the advantages intended by promulation of the
Laws. The commerce at Apalachicola is equal to that of all the other
Gulf Seaports in Florida. The newspaper which I have named
deserves the patronage of the Government as well for its general
respectability as for its adherence to the doctrines of the present
administration*

NATHAN SARGENT TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
[NA:ND, SN Live Oak Lets.:ALS]
WASHINGTON July 28, 1841
HON GEO. E. BADGER Secty of the Navy,
SIR. Having been charged by you with the duty of preserving
from waste removal &c, the timber growing on the Public Lands in
East Florida, and specially the Live Oak; and having proceeded to
Florida for the purpose, I found myself at once embarrassed in the
discharge of my duties by causes which I will as briefly as possible
State.
The Timber reserved for public use consists of Hammocks of Live
Oak scattered over nearly the whole of East Florida but particularly
* Cf. post, p. 412.


## p. 361 (#373) ############################################

FL OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 361
near the coast & along and near the streams navigable for vessels or
batteaux. The reservations made by the agents sent out for that
purpose have never been surveyed nor plotted upon any map, and
through described perhaps as accurately as they could be without
such survey it is impossible to know their bounds for in fact they have
none defined: and in case a private grant happen to lie contiguous, it
would be out of the power of the Agent, were the owner of this grant
cutting timber to determine whether he were within his own limits or
trespassing on the public land. As a lawyer you know the difficulty
of defending what is not defined. These private grants, very many
of which have been confirmed to the claimants by the Territorial
courts, are also scattered over the whole extent of E. Florida, and in
some cases bound upon the public reservations and perhaps in part
cover them; and as neither have ever been surveyed & their boundaries
marked, a serious difficulty meets the Agent at the very threshold of
his duties, & this difficulty must continue to exist until the country is
surveyed, & the private grants & the public reservations properly
called & bounded.
But suppose this difficulty surmounted, the Agent has at present
no means of going from place to place along the coast, up the creeks
and inlets where vessels would be likely to Secrete themselves, nor
from Key to Key, to look for trespassers. A coast of some six or
seven hundred miles in extent, from Amelia Island on the North &
East round the Southern point of the Peninsula, up past Tampa Bay
to the Mouth of the Suwanee, on the west, including the numerous
Keys, some of them thirty miles in extent, that lie scattered round the
southern part of Florida, is committed to his charge, while a very large
portion, say nine tenths of it, at least, is an entire wilderness, and
inaccessible at present, by land. How is he to guard all this coast
& these Islands from depredation? True, he has the privilege of
passing to & fro in the public steam boats, but he must confine his
movements to theirs, visit the places they visit, go when they go &
return when they return, and as they go only from one military post
to another without touching at intermediate places along the coast
or on the St John's River, and as trespassers will take special care to
avoid these places, it is to little purpose that the Agent avails himself
of this privilege.
As there is seldom an evil without some resulting good, in the
present case, the Indian war, a most grevious and lamentable evil,
performs the duty of the Agent in the Southern part, & indeed in
nearly the whole of E. Florida, more effectually than he could perform
it himself under the most favorable circumstances, and so long as the
Indians occupy the country, there is no danger of the Live Oak Timber

362 T E R R I TOR I. A. L. PA P E R S
being cut & carried away. The same cause will of course deter the
Agent from exposing his life among the Hammocks.
From what I have said you will probably come to the conclusion
that, for the present, at least, the Agency might as well be abolished,
or the duties & salary of the Agent suspended. Although I am the
incumbent of the office, my own sense of what is due to the Govern-
ment & to frankness, compels me to say that to this conclusion my
mind has also arrived after looking at the subject in its various bear-
ings. I know the President & his administration are desirous to carry
out the principle of Retrenchment in all cases where it can be done
without detriment to the public interests, and I cannot but admit
that I think this a proper case for the application of that principle,
although I may be the sufferer by it.
I will take the liberty however, to suggest, that as there may be
some Hammocks of Live Oak more exposed to trespassers than those
which lie in the immediate vicinity of the Indians, and as some of the
public lands covered with pine timber are exposed to the depredations
of the owners of sawmills—especially on the St John's River, in case
the suggestion above made should be adopted, the duty of protecting
the public timber be assigned to some one or more of the public
officers now in the Territory, and a small compensation allowed there-
for in addition to their present emoluments which are very small.
Should the Agency be hereafter re established it will be indispensable
that the Agent be allowed the use of a small vessel—say of 60 or 70 tons
burden, and three or four men to navigate her, with which to cruise
along the coast and among the Keys, look into the creeks and inlets
&c.; and he should also be authorised to appoint assistants, say four
or five with a very small compensation, at different points of the coast
to watch trespassers & give notice of their depredations. Without
all this, so soon as the Indians are driven from the country it would
be morally impossible for him to protect the Timber from depredators.
I will take the liberty further to remark, that great caution should
be used in selecting a person to take charge of the public Timber; for
if he be not one whose integrity is above temptation, the opportunity
he would have of colluding with trespassers and thereby filling his
pocket at the expense of that which he was sent to protect, might
overcome his sense of duty to the Government. The situation of the
Timber in E. Florida & its great value, offer strong inducements to
dishonest practices on the part of the Agent.

SIR; The Major General directs me to communicate to you the
following instructions received from the Department of War.
The Governor of Florida has recently represented to the Depart-
ment that numerous murders &c. have been committed by wandering
savages in Florida, within the last few months, and earnestly re-
quested the services of a militia or volunteer force, for the protection
of the border inhabitants of that Territory.”
It is possible that the distance of your Head Quarters from the
scenes of these reported barbarities, together with the absorbing
nature of your duties in the interior, may have prevented you from
receiving full information on this subject, and it is therefore sug-
gested that you invite an interview with the civil executive authority
of the territory, under such circumstances as your duties may enable
you to designate, in order to learn the views of the Governor directly
from himself, to the end that such additional measures may be
adopted as may be calculated to give security and protection to the
people.
You are requested to consider whether this can be effected by
detachments from the Army now under your command without
embarrassing your operations in the more Southern parts of the
Territory. If this cannot be done, it is not doubted that a due re-
gard to the means necessary to the success of general operations,

as well as the safety of the people in the northern districts, will induce

O.I.A. 24th August 1841
MAJOR W" ARMSTRONG Choctaw Agency. West of Arkansas.
SIR. I received your letter of 17th ulto,” calling my attention
to the claim of the Apalachicola Indians, emigrated by Daniel Boyd,
to be paid for their improvements according to his valuations—a
copy of a certificate of one of which you enclose me.”
You are correct in saying that the objection to paying these claims
was that the $15.400. mentioned in the 2d article of the Treaty of
Payne's Landing, was not applicable to their discharge—but be-
longed to the Seminoles, and although the Apalachicola and Seminole
Indians may be regarded as one tribe, when spoken of as Florida
Indians, yet it is quite clear to my mind that an error was committed
in supposing, as was done in July 1838, that the former had any
claim upon the $15.400 fund.” To put this matter to rest, as I
think a full understanding of the subject must do, I will remark
that this office seems to have thought in February 1838 precisely
as I do now, as appears by a letter of that date to George Walker,

of which I send you a copy.” I, also, accompany this communication
by a copy of an opinion drawn up by myself, on 12 July 1839. which
goes into detail on this subject, and I think shows conclusively that
the fund of $15.400 is payable to the Seminoles alone. This opinion
was expressed briefly in a letter to you of Nov 12th 1839.” I will
thank you to explain this matter fully to the Apalachicolas, and
satisfy them that the Department has no power to apply any part
of the above money to pay for their improvements. It would be
a misapplication of an exclusively Seminole fund to their use, which
could not be justified.
The error commenced, in my opinion, in the letter of instructions,
of 18th July 1838, to Daniel Boyd,” who valued the Apalachicola
improvements &c in which the mistaken opinion is expressed that
“so soon as the required amounts for improvements and cattle can
be ascertained, a remittance will be made for the purpose of those
payments.” The 5th article of the Treaty made at Payne's Landing,
on the 9th May 1832," would extend to the Apalachicolas, but M’
Boyd, in a communication to this office, of 3d Feb” 1839,” says,
“no cattle were turned over to me nor property of any kind save
the improvements embraced in the accompanying certificates—”
still a claim for this species of property would not be in lien on the
$15.400, but would require a seperate appropriation by Congress.
The letter of instructions alluded to and the certificate issued by
M" Boyd in accordance therewith certainly contain (as appears by
the copy of one sent by you) a promise to pay the Apalachicolas
for their improvements—but I do not find any treaty stipulation to
that effect. The whole proceeding grew out of the erroneous idea
that the Apalachicola Indians were entitled to come in, under the
2d article of the treaty of Payne's Landing for the $15.400. Still
as the promise has been made and the Indians will be dissatisfied
if there is not a compliance with it, I will ask Congress at its next
regular session for an appropriation of the amount necessary to meet
these valuations amounting to some $3000—they may be a little
more or less as I have not cast them up—but as these claims rest
entirely on the promise of my predecessor, it will be in the discretion
of Congress to grant or refuse the appropriation.
If granted immediate measures will be taken for their payment.

with whom the reasons assigned by you are conclusive as to the
impolicy and danger of permitting any of the negroes to remain in
Florida.
You are therefore authorized to remove them all with the Indians.
You will, however, by the aid of a board of Officers, or in such other
way as you may deem proper, carefully investigate all claims that
may be preferred, keeping a register of the names of the claimants
of the slaves and of the particular Indians holding them; upon which
register the estimated value of each slave will be noted. In this
estimate it will be proper to consider the difficulty and expense
which would have attended the recovery of the slave and to make a
correspondent deduction from his intrinsic value. It must be under-
stood, however, that this investigation is not to commit the Govern-
ment for the payment of these claims, but is intended only for its
information, and for the basis of any proceedings hereafter which
it may seem expedient and proper to adopt when all the circum-

SIR, In acknowledging your letter of the 1" inst." I have the
honor to state that your anxiety respecting the security of the citizens
of Florida is duly appreciated and that your representations and
suggestions will always be treated with the high consideration they
deserve.
The recent favorable intelligence from Florida induces the grati-
fying anticipation that all cause of anxiety will soon be removed by
the submission and emigration of the Indians; but so long as any
remain, the Department will faithfully continue its efforts to protect
the citizens from their attacks and ravages.
The Department regrets that it does not feel authorized to sanction
the calling out a force of militia. It would not be justified in so doing
either by the present state of affairs in Florida or in view of the mani-
fest disinclination of Congress at its last session to appropriate more
than was barely sufficient to meet expenditures already incurred
in the employment of this species of force.

Key West, FLORIDA Sept. 17. 1841
TO THE HONORABLE DANIEL WEBSTER Secretary of State.
SIR. About the first of July last I addressed a package to His
Excellency the President of the United States,” wherein, among other
things, I alleged, & concisely set forth the facts upon which the allega-
tion was based, that property wrecked upon this coast had never
adequate protection & very often none at all; & that such property
amounted in value to several hundred thousand dollars annually.
I also suggested a means by which a remedy might be applied.
As yet, however, I have received no reply to that communication; &
having forwarded it by a transient vessel via Boston, I fear that it
never reached the President.”
Since that time another case has occurred here under circumstances
which leave no doubt in my mind that property to the value of from
$5,000 to $15,000 has been sacrificed for the want of due protection.
This cannot be possitively proved; but the combination of circum-
stances is so strong as to leave no doubt in a rational mind, that could
the property sacrificed be found & libeled it would be restored to the
original owners.
If my late package has not been received, & you consider this a
proper subject for the consideration of the Department of State, I
shall be pleased to lay before you a full statement of facts whenever
it shall best suit your convenience to receive it.

WASHINGTON Sept. 27. 1841
TO HIS EX. JOHN TYLER President of the U. States
SIR With sentiments of gratitude for the honour which you have
done me by appointing me to the office of Judge of the Middle District
of Florida," I regret to say that I am compelled solely by the utter
inadequacy of the compensation to meet my necessary expenditure,
to decline its acceptance.—
Feeling a very deep interest in this appointment and knowing its
great importance to the people of Florida, I trust your Excellency will
pay no regard to the idle clamor of those who want offices for which
they are incompetent, and contend that all appointments must be
made from Florida, whether we have a man suitable or not.
I am satisfied that we have no man suitable for this office, and every
lawyer and other person with whom I have conversed upon the sub-
ject, has agreed with me—I can recommend none, and protest in the
strongest terms against the appointment of any of those whose recom-
mendations are on file in the State Department—There is not one of
them who would be tolerable to the bar or people or would do any
credit to the administration, and the appointment of some of them
would be disgraceful.
All we ask is an honest man and one who has a reasonable degree
of legal knowledge, and a capacity for comprehending legal reasoning
and we shall never ask from what—part of the country he comes—If
he is a man of sense he will soon become a Floridian.
As we have no one now fit for the station—I hope none will be
appointed from Florida.
I take this occassion to impress again in the most earnest upon the
President the importance of the appointment of George S Hawkins to
be District Attorney of Middle Florida, and to renew
my assurances of the highest respect &c of your obt serv"

WASHINGTON, October 8, 1841.
DEAR SIR: The enclosed copy of a letter from the P. O. Depart-
ment, I send to you for publication. The information will probably
be acceptable. The new route proposed will accommodate a large
portion of Columbia, Madison and Jefferson Counties, which have
been heretofore almost excluded from the benefit of the mail arrange-
ment.—The commencement will be at Alligator instead of Mineral
Springs. I wish publicity given to it, in order that the inhabitants
upon the route may be consulting as to the most convenient locations
for Post Offices. Their petitions for offices will be attended to with-
out delay.
By this arrangement, the route from Pulaski to Troupville will be
discontinued, but the new route will connect with the Troupville mail
at Cherry Lake P. O. in Madison County, which will be equally con-
venient to the inhabitants of Hamilton Co. as the present arrange-
ment. Respectfully,

October 20th 1841–
To ROBERT BUTLER Esq Surveyor General Tallahassee Flor. Ter.
SIR I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of
the 6" instant," in which you state, that you have had a diagram
made of the reservation and Town of St Marks and find “that there is
a considerable amount of Land without its limits for the future ex-
tention of the town, and that the only interference will be the 10 acre
donation to the Tallahassee Rail Road Company, which you find will
break upon the plan to some little extent.” In reply I have to state,
that as the original report and plan of the town of St. Marks sub-
mitted to this Office, bearing date the 15" of February 1830, con-
templated future enlargement of the town on the East, North and
West, it is suggested whether in the survey now to be made the original
plan had not better be at once extended through the vacant lands
intercepted between the lines laid down on the Map and the private
claim.
As regards the interference of the ten acres granted to the Rail
Road Company by the act of 3" of March 1835" the location of
which was approved by the President on the 25" of June 1835. sub-

sequent to the date of the original plan of the Town, and to the acts
of Congress of the 2" March 1833 " and the 30th June 1834,” the
first authorizing the President of the United States to cause the
town to be laid off and sold, providing also that “he may adapt, if he
shall approve such plan as may have already been reported to the
General Land Office.” in pursuance of which a portion of the lots
were advertised for sale by proclamation of the President, bearing date
the 21" of November 1834," and the last authorizing the sale of the
lots “according to the plan of the Surveyor General of said Territory”
It appears to me that the original plan of the town as laid down on
the plat of 1830, cannot without further legislation of Congress be
made to give to the Rail Road grant as surveyed, but it being desirable
and necessary to have all the facts before this Office, shewing the pre-
cise extent and nature of the interference before any final decision
is made thereon, you will please in making the survey to proceed in
such manner as to leave this question open for future adjustment,
which need not prevent a complete survey being made by the Deputy
without respecting the interfering portion of the Rail Road grant.”

HON. DAVID LEVY, Delegate from Florida.
SIR, Your letter of the 6" instant,” addressed to the President,
in relation to Indian hostilities in Florida, was referred to this De-
partment on the 11th instant; but in consequence of the personal
interviews between us, I have postponed a written answer to your
communication in favor of more pressing matters.
You are aware that the order for the withdrawal of a portion of the
Dragoons from Florida has been so modified as to leave it discretionary
with Colonel Worth to postpone its excution until he shall be satisfied
that their services will be no longer necessary to the proper efficiency
of his command.
Your letter concludes with four separate propositions, which,
however, may be summed up thus: To call out a militia force for

protection, and place it under some officer independent of Colonel
Worth, who is to be restricted to offensive operations with the regular
troops.
It is not perceived that any advantage can be reasonably expected
from a division of the commands in Florida, but rather, it is ap-
prehended, that great inconvenience might result from the want of
concert of action between the two commanders. The Government
has entire confidence in the disposition and ability of Colonel Worth,
not only to conduct the offensive operations against the Indians, but
also, through his subordinate officers, to afford all requisite and proper
protection to the frontier inhabitants; and for this purpose, he has been
authorized, whenever he might deem it expedient to call into service
any portion of the militia, not exceeding one regiment. Prompted by
every humane and generous motive, and urged by frequent communi-
cations from this Department, no doubt is entertained that he will
do whatever is proper to be done for the defence of the frontier.

SIR, In the Commisioner's report to your predecessor of the
27th July last,” on the subject of the discrepancy of $2000 in the
surveying accounts of Robert Butler the Surveyor General at Talla-
hassee Florida Territory, to which report I beg leave to refer, it was
recommended that time might be allowed to Mr. Butler to enable
him to complete the examinations instituted by him in his office, for
the purpose of discovering the origin and nature of the error, and
of explaining to the Department. I now have the honor to submit
herewith Mr. Butler's report to this Office, bearing date the 14th
instant on the result of his examinations, from which it will be per-
ceived that after a careful and laborious examination and comparison
of all the Field notes of survey in his office a trifling discrepancy of
only $3 85/100 has been discovered, which the Surveyor General
supposes to have arisen from errors in the additions or rejected frac-
tions, and having given up all hope of discovering as he originally
expected any vouchers to cover the amount of the discrepancy of
$2000, he now considers himself responsible for the amount hereto-
fore credited in his accounts with the United States.

tlement of the interest on Bonds of the Bank guaranteed by the
Territory and in reply Gov. Call assumes that the Territory stands
to the Bondholders in the relation only of a remote and contingent
endorser whose responsibility does not arise until after the failure
of the Bank of Pensacola and its respective stockholders. It appears
on the face of the Bonds (of which we inclose a copy) that the Bank
is indebted to the Territory who by assigning them and making
them payable to bearer assumes the responsibility of a commercial
endorser directly liable to the holders—It was on the strength of
this guarantee of the Territory that the Bonds were negotiated &
found Takers in this country”—
Now permit me respectfully to call your attention to the tenor
of the Bond:
Upon its face are the following words:
“Guaranteed by the Territory of Florida The Capital stock of
the Bank pledged to the Territory and the Stockholders individually
and personally liable for the redemption thereof"
The endorsment is as follows:
“In pursuance of the laws of this Territory, the within Bond is
hereby assigned and made payable to the bearer thereof, and the
payment thereof and of the Interest thereon as within stipulated
is hereby guaranteed by the Territory of Florida, and the faith of
the Territory pledged for the redemption thereof”—
From which it would appear that the Bond only has been trans-
ferred to bearer thereby making it a commercial paper to all intents
& purposes, whilst the capital stock of the Bank pledged to the Ter-
ritory has remained under its guardianship as a Security for its
endorsment.
Should this be found to be the true state of the case and to me
it appears incontrovertible would it be prudent to leave it to the
Bondholders to sue the Bank and the stockholders for the trifling
amount of unpaid interest which as stated in your letter of 28 June
above alluded to “there is every reason to believe that the stock-
holders abroad are withdrawing the funds of the Bank beyond the
jurisdiction of the Territory & appropriating them in a manner not
warranted by charter”?
It must appear evident to you that an attachment for $6750 which
is the amount claimed by me in behalf of Messr" Hope & Co for
unpaid interests would be a very trifling security to the $225000
of Bonds they represent & which bear the endorsment of the Territory.
As the case, however is urgent, I am ready to join you in any
measure likely to insure the Interest of both parties & I shall feel

WILLIAM J. WORTH TO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL
[NA:WD,Adj. Gen. Lets. Recd., W474:LS]
No 74 Head Qrs. Army of Florida TAMPA Novr 1* 1841.
SIR: I have the honor to report for the information of the Major
General commanding the Army, that the Camp at Punta Rassa,”
standing on the site of old Fort Dulany was visited by a gale on the
night of the 19* inst & all the public property consisting of store-
houses, tents, arms in hand and in boxes, clothing, Quarter Masters &
Commissary's stores &c, was carried away by the action of the waves
which swept over the entire place to the depth of several feet. The
gale commenced about 11 o'clock at night & continued with great
violence until 5 the next morning. Its fury was chiefly spent on the
building occupied as a hospital, and which from the direction the
storm took was most exposed to attack. It gives me pleasure, how-
ever, to state that, through the intredidity and unceasing exertions
of Asst: Surgeon Simpson, whose conduct on the occasion entitles
him to high praise, all the sick were saved with the exception of one
soldier, who was unfortunately swept off & drowned. The storm
was as unprecedented as violent. It could not have been foreseen &
when occuring, it is not probable that any efforts could have protected
the property, although I apprehend it will be found in the investiga-
tion which I shall institute, that with the honorable exception above
mentioned, suitable efforts were not made by the proper persons to
mitigate the condition of the troops, & subsequently, to recover the
means of sustaining them. Major Belknap of the 3" infy, now in
command of the entire force on the Carlooshatchee,” & who was at
Fort Denand * on special service with two of the companies from
Punta Rassa, fortunately returned a few hours after the storm abated,
& gave all necessary orders. It was equally fortunate that transports
which had been sent hence a few daye previous, with ample supplies

of provisions, in anticipation of coming operations south, arrived at
Punta Rassa one day after the troops had become destitute. The
loss of property is not great, being limited to a portion of the arms &
equipments of two companies, besides ammunition; the entire clothing
of the men except what they had on; some six thousand rations of
provisions; several mules & wagons; twelve canoes & boats; & other
trifling articles of Quarter Masters supplies. The buildings which
were constructed by the labor of the troops, were, with the exception
of the hospital, of light material, chiefly palmetto, & their loss, so
far as respects military operations, is deemed of no consequence.
The public Steamer “Isis” lying in the harbour, was driven ashore by
the violence of the storm, on the ground occupied by the camp. She
will be got off, it is believed, without damage, but with much labour.
The other Steam boat “Hyperion” also in the public service, was at
the time, up the Carlooshatchee & sustained but partial injury. The
garrison at Punta Rassa will be removed and a post established four
miles above on an eligible position, which, it is believed, would have
been originally occupied had it been known, as now, that it was
accessible for transport.
I have the pleasure to add that while at Fort Denand, Major
Belknap succeeded in getting in thirty three of the southern indians,
among them several important persons, who have reached this place.
He has returned to Fort Denand with a command, engaged in estab-
lishing a post near the old site, & reports the prospect of having in
his possession in a few days upwards of one hundred more of these
indians.
By my report N° 62" you were advised that a combined military
& naval operation had been directed to the Everglades, under Capt.
Burk of the Army and Lt. Rogers of the Navy. This force in boats
with Capt. M"Laughlin of the Navy, who subsequently joined, pene-
trated the Everglades, proceeded through a portion of the Big Cypress
and debouched on the Gulf 18 miles below Punta Rassa, coming out
by a stream hitherto unknown, north of Cape Romain. This com-
mand has been directed to proceed to Jupiter inlet on the Atlantic
side via the Carlooschatchee, the Okeechobee & the Locha Hatchee,
on which latter stream, recent intelligence places Jones & his band of
seceders from the Prophet, with whom he has quarrelled. I have the
honor to enclose the report of Major Belknap, copy of the report of
Capt. M"Laughlin to the Secretary of the Navy, & a memorandum
indicating contemplated operations south,” in fixing the time for
which, I have been governed by the recent activity of Major Childs
30 Oct. 7, 1841 (NA, WD, AGO Lets. Recd., W 438).

sides, added to which is a desire before moving south, to entirely
free the settlements from molestation, which I am happy to say there
is now a fair & speedy prospect of accomplishing.
In my report N° 71,” you were informed that the important band
of Neathlock E. Mathla was secure. That chief with Tiger tail &
two other brothers & thirty of his people, presented themselves and
surrendered their arms on the 19" inst, the remaining numbers of
that band are now on their route in & close by. The most important
of these persons have already been dispatched, in conjunction with
several of the friendly indians from the Arkansas, to rally the Creeks;
meantime the troops in the direction of the settlements are kept in
constant activity.
I have ordered a reissue of certain articles of clothing, free of charge,
to those soldiers who actually lost their clothing in consequence of
the late disaster at Punta Rassa, which I hope will be approved by
the Commanding General.”

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt this morning
of your letter of 20" Ulto," and the acts of Congress pass'd at at the
late extra session
In reply to your letter I would respectfully state that a present
enlargement of the plan of S’ Marks would be impolitic, in as much
as the contract and instructions have issued (and copies forwarded
on the 1st inst) and the extent thereof being sufficient in all prob-
ability, to meet present demands—Should its enlargement be
demanded when the lots are sold, it can be easily effected at a small
cost from the provisions embraced in my instructions to the Sur-
veyor.—Your views correspond with my own on the subject of the
Donation to the T. R. R. C. as express'd in my letter to the late
Comm', yet have I his instructions and that of the opinion of the
Attorney General in opposition—The course you recommend shall
be persued when the Survey is returned, and was intended so to be,
as you may infer from my instructions to the Deputy to lay it down
in dotted lines as an interferance—I shall call the attention of the
Commissioner to the whole subject when the survey shall be reported.
The prospect of a termination of this vexacious war, again seems
to brighten upon us, and I would suggest that I be advised of the
General wishes of the Department with regard to the future surveys
and their period of commencement at the earliest moment of Safety,

EDMUND J. FORSTALL TO GOVERNOR CALL
[NA:SD Misc. Letters:C]
No 4 PENSACOLA 7 November 1841
To HIS EXCELLENCY RKCALL Governor of the Territory of Florida—
SIR I had the honor of addressing you on the 29" Ult” from
Mobile"—I reached this place last evening & look for an answer
from you by tomorrow's or Wednesday's mail, in the meantime
allow me a few quotations & remarks which the perusal of the several
laws constituting the Territory of Florida, & the Bank of Pensacola
now for the first time before me naturally suggest—
Gordon's Digest Page 195 Sect: 679–“The Governor shall publish
throughout the said Territory all the laws which shall be made &
shall on or before the 1 December, in each year, report the same
to the President of the United States, to be laid before Congress
which if disapproved by Congress shall thenceforth be of no force”.
“Every bill which shall have passed the Legislative council shall
before it becomes a law be presented to the Governor—if he approve
it he shall sign it—and if not he shall return it with his objection in
writing to the Legislative council”
By the law entitled “An act to increase the Capital of the Bank
of Pensacola & to amend the laws incorporating said Bank and other
purposes” approved 14 Feb 1835–
Sect: 1—provides for the increase of the capital to $500.000.
Sect: 4 Authorises the issue of $500.000, of Bonds to be endorsed
by the Territory as follows—: “In pursuance of the Laws of
the Territory the within Bond is hereby assigned and made
payable to the bearer thereof and the payment thereof and of
the interest thereon as within stipulated is hereby guaranteed
by the Territory of Florida and the faith of the Territory is
pledged for the resumption thereof.”
Sect: 6. provides for a further issue of Bonds under the same
guarantee.
Sect: 7. In consideration of the guarantee of the Territory, requires
the hypothecation of the Capital Stock of said Bank and of
its property real & personal & of the Stock it may then or there-
after hold in the Alabama, Florida & Georgia Rail Road Comp”
in favor of said Territory—
Sect. 8. Requires that the profits of the Bank & all profits of the
stock owned by said Bank in said Alabama, Florida & Georgia
Rail Road Comp' shall be exclusively appropriated to the pay-
ment of the interest & principal of said Bonds as aforesaid &
* Ante, p. 383.

furthermore “that the stockholders of said Bank of said Rail
Road shall be individually and personally liable for the redemp-
tion of said Bonds—
By An act supplemental to several acts incorporating the Bank
of Pensacola—approved 10 Feb 1838
the 2* Sect: provides for the repeal of the 8" Sect: of the act en-
titled “An Act to increase the Capital of the Bank of Penascola
and to amend the laws incorporating said Bank and for other
purposes thereby relieving the stockholders from personal
Responsibility”
From all which it is self evident.
1° That as by the law organising Florida into a Territorial Govern-
ment, all laws of the Territory have to be submitted annually
to the President of the U. S. & Congress for their approbation *—
that the acts of the Territory of Florida entitled “An act
to increase the Capital of the Bank of Pensacola and to amend
the laws incorporating said Bank and for other purposes” ap-
proved 14 Feb 1835. & an act supplemental to several acts
incorporating the Bank of Pensacola “approved 10 Feb 1838–
not having been disapproved by the President of the U. S. find
themselves de facto approved by the Federal Government.
2° That the Executive of the Territory of Florida having a veto
power and not having exercised it fully approved the above
named acts—
3° That by the act of 14 Feb 1835. The consideration of the guaran-
tee of the Bonds by the Territory was a direct hypothecation
to said Territory of all the property of the Bank (See Sect: 7) &
the responsibility of the stockholders (See Sect 8)
4° That the endorsment of said Bonds to order—not conveying
the transfer of the guarantee thus required by the Territory
the guarantee in the 8* Sect: above cited was a contract between
the Territory & the Stockholders in no way affecting third
parties—
5 That the hypothecation of the property of the Bank & the personal
responsibility of the stockholders being viewed by the Executive
& the Legislature of Florida—& the Federal Government as
a contract between the stockholders & the Territory perfectly
independent of the Bonds which have been assigned with no
other guarantee than that of the Territory (See Sect: 4) a sup-
plemental act to several acts incorporating the Bank of Pensa-
cola was passed on the 10" Feb 1838 & approved by the Gov-
ernor of the Territory, & the Federal Government—whereby

the 8" Sect: of the act to increase the Capital of the Bank of
Pensacola and to amend the laws incorporating said Bank &
for other purposes being repealed the Stockholders of said Bank
found themselves relieved by law of all personal responsibility—
And no other construction can be put upon said supplemental
act, for on close examination it will be found that it could have
had no other object in view than the release of the Stockholders,
the other provisions therein contained being only a repetition
of the conditions already provided for in the act of 14 Feb'
1835–(See Sect 8) as to the Sect: requiring the payment to the
Territory of 2 p 9% on the nett profits of the Bank it was very
well known in 1838 that it was a nullity—
I have been informed that by an act passed in 1840 * the above
act has been repealed as being unconstitutional in my humble opinion
I cannot see the unconstitutionality of that act—Surely the hypotheca-
tion & personal responsibility of the Stockholders having remained
altogether in the sole possession of the Territory, in consideration of
its guarantee of the Bonds issued by the Bank—& these Bonds being
transferred by the Territory to Bearer only with its own guarantee—
the right of the Territory to abandon such personal security cannot be
disputed.
The Bondholders surely cannot complain for they well knew that
they only had the faith of the Territory to look to & should it fail—
the Federal Government—there was no contract between them &
the Stockholders consequently there can be no breach of contract so
far as they are interested—As to the law of 1840 it appears to me an
ex post facto law to all intents & purposes.
I beg leave to repeat that Mess" Hope & C. never understood the
guarantee of the Bonds otherwise than above expressed by the law
creating the same to wit. the faith of the Territory under the guard-
ianship of the Federal Government and that they always believed
that the approbation of both the Executive appointed by the Federal
Government & of the Federal Government itself made these Bond's
equal to any National fund—

SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 29" Ult° * informing me that Mess" Hope & Co of Amsterdam

guaranteed by the Territory of Florida, and that they have instructed

396 T E R R ITO RIA L PA P E R S
After the most mature reflection I have found no cause to change the
opinion expressed in my letter of the 25 June last " addressed to
Mess" Hope & Co a copy of which is herewith inclosed, and to which
I beg leave to refer you, as an expression of my present sentimenton
the subject.
I am truly desirous Sir, that the interest due on the Bonds held
by this highly respectable house (which has often evinced a great
degree of liberality towards American Securities) should be paid
with the least possible delay; and I am animated by the most ardent
desire, to sustain the honour of this Territory and redeem its pleges,
to the last fraction of her responsibility—But I consider it a common
act of justice to the people of Florida, to require on the part of the
Bondholders, due, and strict diligence to recover both the interest
and principal of the Bonds from the Bank of Pensacola, the Stock-
holders of that Bank, and the Stockholders of the Alabama Florida
and Georgia Rail Road Company—They are first liable under the
Charter of incorporation, and should stand between the Territory
and the Bondholders—They were so regarded by the Authorities
of the Territory when the Bonds were endorsed, and must have
been thus considered by the purchasers of the Bonds, as the interest
appears to have been paid for a series of years without application
to the Territory or without our authorities ever knowing by whom
it was paid, or by whom received—The Holders of these obligations
have unquestionable right to maintain an action at law against the
parties above mentioned, and recover from them, the sum now de-
manded, while the Territory would fail in such an action were she
to seak indemnity from the Stockholders, after paying the amount
claimed. The Bonds of the Bank were endorsed and delivered by
the Territory to that institution, without consideration—The prin-
cipal Stock Holders became the first purchasers of the Bonds from
the Bank—They are the next endorsers of the Bonds They received
the money for them, and they through the directors of the Bank
had almost the exclusive control and management of the funds and
property, both of the Bank and Rail Road while the Territory has
neither exercised authority over them, nor derived the least benefit
whatever from them—
The pledge of the Capital Stock of the Bank to the Territory you
will percieve cannot have been regarded by any one at any time,
as more than a nominal Security. The Capital of the Bank must

FL OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 397
from the nature of the institution have remained in the custody,
or under the control of the Officers of the Bank, and they being
subject to the will of the Stockholders residing abroad, you will
readily discover with what ease the capital might be withdrawn
from the Bank, and transported beyond the jurisdiction of this Ter-
ritory, without the knowledge or consent of its authorities It was
therefore not on this empty pledge that the Territory relied as a
Security, but on the immediate responsibility of the Stockholders
in their private and individual capacity, to the Bondholders, without
the agency or interposition of the Territory
However much the Bonds on their face may be assimilated to
a “commercial paper” and present the appearance (in the language
of Messr" Hope & Co) “that the Bank is indebted to the Territory,
who by assigning the bonds, and making them payable to bearer,
assumes the responsibility to the holder” The presumption arising
from this appearance, must be removed by a knowledge of the facts:
And it can scarcely be credited that the purchasers of the Bonds
were so unguarded & incautious as not to have examined the Charter
of the Institution to ascertain the true character of the transaction,
as well as the relative responsibility of the parties concerned. Nor
do I imagine that they received those Bonds merely by delivery
without the special endorsement of the vendors—Permit me there-
fore Sir, to renew to you the enquiry I made of Messr." Hope & Co,
and which they have omitted (unintentionally no doubt) to answer—
whose names appear on the Bonds subsequent to the endorsment
of the Government of this Territory? If there be no impropriety
in giving this intelligence, I should be obliged by receiving it—
I have thus expressed to you Sir, my undisguised opinion, as one
of the coordinate branches of this Government, on the subject of
the claim of Messr" Hope & Co.—The whole matter will however
at the meeting of the Legislative Council on the first monday in
Jan' next, be presented to that body, for such action as it may think
proper to bestow—"

TALLAHASSEE Novr. 13" 1841
HONBE. CHARLES A WICKLIFF
DR. SIR enclosed is a letter to the President which I request
you will hand to him"—It is as you will see from Geo: K. Walker
Esq former secretary of this Territory and the son of Col" David
Walker of Kentucky deceased. The marshal of the Appalachicola
district has ever been my warm personal friend, but the public in-
terests are suffering from his attention to the duties of his office
and the want of punctualty in paying over the money he collects as
marshal, The general complaint of Mr Gautier is so common that
few are willing to permit him to receive the money on their executions
The statements of Mr Walkers letter are true, and he has much
right to complain of the Marshal, as he has paid about $7000 as
security. and cannot get the marshal to make the money because
his father is liable, and my friend Mr Walker will certainly be greatly
injured if not ruined if he can not in a short time make the money
on his executions—There is no gentleman in Florida of higer moral
worth and character than Mr Walker, and as he some time since
wrote to the President on this subject, he has requested me to get
the case fairly before the President, to prevent his ruin—I know of
but one gentleman in the Apalachicola district who is a Tyler man,
that is every way competent to fill the office of marshal and his
appointment would give in the district more satisfaction than that
of any other person. The gentleman I allude to is Hezikia Hawley
Esq. of the City of Appalachicola. One of the oldest citizens of this
territory, a man of excellent habits of business and known punc-
tuallity—I would recommend no person for office to the President,
but such as would do credit to him and the country—I must beg you
will interest yourself in this matter. for I have now not less than
$100,000 in suit to be collected in the Apalachicola district and every
member of the bar is interested in having a competent and punctual
Marshal—There has been buried here the last season up to this
time 400–out of a population of about 1600, it is now more healthy
but hot, a few cases of yellow fever are occuring. The frost here
has been too slight to kill vegetation, and we have summer heat,
now, and for several days past. My daughter Florida is yet sick &

In reply I have to State that your suggestion to postpone the
enlargement of the town, is approved under the circumstances,
until your promised Report after the Survey now in progress is
completed, shall be received & considered.
In reference to future Surveys in your District after the termination
of the Indian Hostilities, this Office will be better prepared, to give
its views, when the estimates for the service of 1842 shall have been
made up. At present, it appears to me, that the first operations
towards the extension of the Surveys after the removal of the Indians
should be to extend carefully one of the range lines, say the line
between Ranges 23 & 24 East, Southwardly throughout the peninsula,
and run Standard parallels therefrom to the Gulf &c Sea Shores as it
becomes desirable to extend the Surveys of lands for market, to
accomodate occupants & settlers at particular points of the coast at
some future period, which with the Surveys of private claims, and
corrections of the Surveys on the S" Johns River, heretofore the
subject of a correspondence, would give sufficient employment to
your Office for the first year. In the mean time, this Office will be
pleased to learn your views on the subject, which will be duly
considered.”

of the Legislative Council of Florida & of the Governor of that

The Bank of Pensacola having failed to pay the current Interest

Under date of 28* June 1841.” Gov. R. K. Call acknowledges the
above notification—recognises the liability of the Territory but
assumes “That the Territory stands to the Bond Holders in the
relation of a remote and contingent endorser whose responsibility
does not arise until after the failure of the Bank of Pensacola and
its respective Stockholders” & adds “I have every confidence in the
honor of this Territory & believe she will in good faith redeem her
responsibility when it shall have arisen, but in the character of a
remote endorser, she will exact due diligence on the part of the
Bond Holders prosecuting their claims against the Bank and the
Individual Stockholders who are first bound, and who also have
had the advantage of the money raised by the sale of the Bonds—
I would therefore recommend to you, & other Bond Holders to
proceed at once and without delay by attachment against the assetts
of the Bank of Pensacola, as well by action against the Individual
Stockholders—I am induced to recommend the process of attachment
against the Bank, because I have every reason to believe that the
Stockholders abroad are withdrawing the funds of the Bank, beyond
the jurisdiction of this Territory and appropriating them in a manner
not warranted by the Charter” (See copy of Gov” Calls letter
hereto annexed & N° 2)—
This assumption, Mess" Hope & Co could not admit & on the 29"
Ult° " I so notified his Excellency (as p copy of said letter annexed
under N° 3) on the 7" Ins"I again addressed Gov” Call" (as pannexed
copy N° 4) explaining the grounds taken by Mess" Hope & Co for
themselves & other Bond Holders—on the 8" I presented myself
at the Bank of Pensacola with a notary public & there demanded
payment of the Interest on the Bonds due 1 Jan 1841 & 1 July 1841
amounting to $6750 *—payment having been refused, the inclosed
Protest N° 5. was entered & immediately notified to the Bank of

A reference to the annexed papers & letters above referred to will

ferred to Bearer on the 2" December 1835— by his Excellency
John H Eaton Governor of the Territory of Florida to the amount
of $500.000–
30 That the above charter & emission of $500,000—not having
been disapproved by the President & Congress of the United
States at the usual Session of said Congress after the creation of
said charter of the Bank of Pensacola & emission of Bonds as
above designated—found themselves de facto approved by the
Federal Government (see Gordon's Digest page 195—Sect 679
&c)
4° That by virtue of said charter of the Bank of Pensacola—the
Bond only was transferred, the guarantee remaining in the sole
possession & under the sole control of the Territory of Florida
as the consideration for its indorsment.
5° That this construction of the Charter of said Bank of Pensacola
has been sanctioned by the Governor & Legislative Council of
Florida & the President & Congress of the United States by the
passage of a law approved 10 Feb 1838" whereby the stock-
holders of the Bank of Pensacola were relieved from all personal
responsibility—which law does not appear to have been disap-
proved by the Federal Government—
Permit me now to call your attention to the Bank reports to the
Legislative Council of Florida in the spring of 1840—which document
I do not send you as I suppose that it is to be found in the Archives of
your Department— A reference to pages 36 & 37 will show you
that so far back as November 1839 Rail Roads & Machinery to a very
large amount hypothecated to the Territory of Florida for its endors-
ment were suffered by the Executive to be shipped to New York & to
be sold to the Montgomery Rail Road Comp” which is a proof that at
that epoch at least the Executive of Florida entertained a different
opinion to that expressed in Gov” Call's letter of 28 June 1841 before
quoted, otherwise how to account for the recommendation of Gov'
Call to the Bond Holders more than 3 years after the Stockholders
have been relieved by law of all personal responsibility—& upwards
of one year after the only guarantee remaining to wit: the Rail Roads
Machinery &c have been suffered to be carried away? By the same
Document you will see that the principal Stockholders of the Bank of

[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 2 sess.:ALS]
KEY WEST. Nov. 20. 1841
DEAR SIR, In compliance with the requests of the two Grand
Juries for Monroe and Dade counties, empannelled at the last May
and November terms, I transmit you their presentments, upon the
subject of a Marine Hospital, Court House, and Jail for this District.
Key West is peculiarly exposed to the aggressions of imported vil-
lians. It is a kind of “Half Way House” for travellers upon the
high seas. Here they stop, refresh themselves, and not infrequently
commit crimes against the laws. The jail is totally insufficient
to secure offenders. The county is too poor to build a jail, and the
Treasury of the Territory is bankrupt—The laws of the United
States cannot be enforced here without a jail. Revolts, mutinies,
stealing from wrecks, assaults and batteries, and murders upon the
high seas, are of not infrequent occurrence on this coast. These
are crimes against the laws of the United States. Will not the con-
gress appropriate money for building a jail at a point like this?
The old court house is very inconvenient and unsuitable for holding
courts in. A new one is much needed.
I estimate the cost of building a good jail here at about $8000.
and a court house about the same.
You are familiar with our wants here and I need not add more
than that
I am Your Obt Servant

SUPERIOR COURT May Term 1841
The Grand Jurors for Monroe County before seperating disere
to present to the consideration of the Congress of the United States
the exposed condition of our community to the depradations of
wicked and lawless persons in consequence of the insecurity and
insufficiency of the jail of our county. A small, inconvenient, badly
arranged, and loose constructed jail, was built in this county in 1833
by the Territory, but its isolated situation, the flimsiness of its ma-
terials and construction render it entirely insecure, and its weakness
is laughed at and despised by the wicked, and deplored by the good.
Since the last sitting of the court it has been several times broken
open, and its lawless inmates turned loose unpunished to prey upon
society. Our Insular situation renders our community peculiarly
liable to have thrown upon it many persons guilty of the crimes
of murder, piracy, larceny, embezzlement, revolt, mutiny, assaults
and batteries and many other offences committed upon the high
seas, and which are only triable and punishable by the laws of the
United States. A large majority of the persons committed to jail
are the prisoners of the United States and yet the Congress has hitherto
never appropriated one cent to the building or repairing a jail in
this entire Judicial District. There are now in jail six persons con-
fined by authority of the United States and we are informed a guard
has been employed by the direction of the Honble. the Judge for
the some time past to watch and protect the jail. The expenses
of this guard must be paid by somebody, and we think that economy,
sound policy, justice to this community, the administration of the
laws, and the honor of the nation require that means should be
supplied here to enable the courts to administer the criminal laws,
to vindicate there supremicy and to confine and punish the guilty.
Crimes against the laws of the United States owing to the frequent
ship wrecks upon our coast, our insular situation and other causes
will forever be of frequent occurrence; and we think that Congress
need only to be informed of the exposed condition of our community
to induce it to interfere and prevent its hereafter being made the
sanctuary of the vile and to administer the proper remedy.
We request your Honor to cause to be transmitted to our Dele-
gate in Congress a copy of this presentment, in the belief, that his

TO HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN TYLER President of the United States.
SIR, I have the honor of transmitting to you copy of a letter which
under date of 18" Ins" I have addressed to the H* the Secretary
of State" on the Subject of a claim against the United States for
interests due on Bonds guaranteed by the Government of the Terri-
tory of Florida—you will perceive by this letter & the documents
therein referred to, which are to be laid before Congress immedi-
ately on its meeting that the claim of the Bond Holders I represent
are founded upon the following facts:
That the Governor—the Judges—the Judicial Executive officers
and even the military officers of the Territory of Florida are appointed
by the Federal Government—That the Members of the Legislative
Council are paid by the National Government—that Congress
regulates the length of the Sessions of the Council—
That Congress besides the power reserved to itself of annulling
the Acts of the Legislative council has given to the Governor in whose

appointment the people of Florida has no voice, the power of vetoing
all Bills unless passed by the 2/3" of the members of each house
(Story vol. III pages 1828–1902 & 2073–)
That in fine the Government of Florida as created & put in motion
by Congress is nothing else than an agency of the Federal Govern-
ment subject to all the obligations of the Principal or the acts of his
agent
I beg also to enclose the copy of an answer of Gov” Call under
date of 12 instant * to a letter which I addressed him on 29" Ult”
copy of which you will find among the documents forwarded to the
H* the Secretary of State—
Governor Call in this answer persists in the position taken by him
in his notification to the Bond Holders of 28* June last" wherein
he assumes “That the Territory stands to the Bond Holders in the
relation only of a remote and contingent endorser whose responsi-
bility does not arise until after the failure of the Bank of Pensacola
and its respective stockholders, and that in her character of a remote
endorser she will exact due diligence on the part of the Bond Holders
prosecuting their claims against the Bank and the Individual stock-
holders who are first bound &c” (See notification to Messr". Hope
& C° bearing date Tallahassee 28 June 1841). & yet it is in proof–
1° That the Charter of the Bank of Pensacola approved 14* Feb-
ruary 1835.” received the sanction of Congress by not having
been disapproved as provided by law at its ensuing Session—and
this is easily accounted for: The very fact of the Bank of Pen-
sacola being created for the purpose of connecting the whole
Territory by rail Roads was causing an immense advance in the
value of her lands—the 7/8" of these lands belonging to the
Federal Government it was deriving by far the greatest and most
immediate benefit by the contemplated introduction of foreign
Capital & building of Rail Roads—hence no doubt the tacit
approbation by Congress of the above charter—
2" That the $500.000 of Bonds issued by the Bank of Pensacola
by virtue of its charter, received the endorsment to bearer of the
Governor of the Territory, the Agent of the Federal Governm"
on the 2" December 1835. & that this issue of Bonds also received
the tacit approbation of Congress by not having been disapproved
at its ensuing Session—

3° That on 10 Feb 1838 the Governor of the Territory of Florida
approved an act " which also finds itself tacitely sanctioned by
Congress, relieving the stockholders of the Bank of Pensacola of
all personal responsibility, whilst on the 28* June 1841—the Gov-
ernor of the same Territory calls upon the Bond Holders to attach
the property of said stockholders!—
4° That by documents transmitted to Congress upwards of 2 years
ago & figuring among its Public documents to the extent of 300
pages it is seen that so far back as November 1839 the Rail Roads
& other property of the Bank of Pensacola hypothecated to the
Territory for her endorsment to bearer of the above $500.000,
Bonds had been suffered to be shipped to New York or sold—
that these acts not having been disapproved by the Governor of
the Territory & Congress remain tacitely sanctioned by them—
and yet with the knowledge of these facts the Governor of the
Territory on the 28 June 1841 for the first time calls upon the
Bond Holders to attach property he knows to be out of the pos-
session of the Bank of Pensacola or the reach of its Creditors!!—
Trusting that you will see the necessity of bringing the whole
of this matter before Congress at an early day of its coming
Session "-

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 17" Ulto" (only just received, oweing to repeated failures of
the mail for the last 2 weeks)
I shall avail myself of the occasion to express my views fully on the
subject of future surveys, when my promised report is made after
the receipt of the survey now in progress at S" Marks and which I
apprehend will be delay’d beyond the period contracted for, arising
from the floods of rain which have fallen upon us for several days
back— The deputy has reported suspension for a short period untill
the high tides and waters shall have subsided, and I do not beleive
now that his report can be received in all this month
I have written to Surveyor Ming to apply in all this month for
payment of the Survey of the Indian reservation on the Appalachicola
River, stating, that no definited advice had yet been received from
Washington of the approval by the President of the Survey and
division of the two reservations of the Indian chiefs as set forth in the
Diagrams forwarded on the 20" August 1839—this claim of Survey
will form another item due previous to the 4" March last, and the
only one apertaining to this office—amounting to $149.52.
I would respectfully solicit a final adjustment of my a/cs, that the
same may be embraced in the a/cs to be renderd at the close of the
present year, and that the balance due me may be remitted by draft
on the Receiver here, as I find difficulty in obtaining the funds from
Appalachicola on the last draft sent me by your request, unless I
were to send a special agent for it at the expense of the government-
I have written Mr Floyd on the subject advising him of the existence
of the draft and requested to Know, whether or not he can make any
arrangement for its payment without incurring such expense
I would suggest the propriety of an order from the President thro'
the department reserving all the land between the Town Plan of

to the head waters of the Locha Hatchee the supposed range of
Jones' band; communicated by note, with Captain M*Laughlin,
commanding the Naval force, suggesting a new direction to his op-
erations; dispatched instructions to Capt. Wright, 8" Infantry,
who entered in boats by Maleo river from the Gulf side, and sent
fresh orders to Major Belknap having the immediate direction of
the command within the Cypress. The last report of this inde-
fatigable officer, as also copies of the several instructions refered
to are herewith forwarded.
I greatly apprehend that the Prophets party, weak and contempt-
ible in numbers, has passed from the Cypress to a lake situated in
a mangrove swamp near to Key Biscayne; to that point I have
directed, in respect to the forces under my orders, & suggested in
regard to those of the Navy, a movement. If not secured at the
present moment, this band, completely environed as it is, must
ultimately fall into our possession; meantime as to any thing like
offensive operation it is perfectly innoxious.
At least two-fifths of the country between the Carlos-hatchee &
the Cypress is under water. In the last mentioned place, as well
as in the approaches to it, the troops suffered almost incredible
hardships & privations; but without a murmur, both officers and
men evincing their habitual energy and constancy.
I have now out from this place efficient messengers to meet, at
appointed rendezvous, the Creek leaders, whose bands alone remain
(the Tallahassees being all secured) as objects of apprehension or
harm to the settlements, & I do not entertain a doubt of having
them in my camp within the present moon. This accomplished
I shall feel it my duty, & be prepared to sustain myself before the
Army, the Government, and the country in reporting the War as
ended—in so far as any circumstance of number and position of
the enemy, can by any just mode of reasoning, or fair view of the
case entitle it to that distinction—with a plahs of the dispesitieh ef
proposition to withdraw all the forces, with the exception of two,
possibly for a short period with a view to reassure the people, three
regiments, and an immediate reduction of the whole establishment
to the wants of such a force on ordinary service. Meantime I feel
fully justified in saying in advance that not one dollar extraordinary
need be asked of Congress. In a few days I hope to go more into
detail on these points.”

SIR I have the honor to repeat in this form the subject of a per-
sonal recommendation made a few days since.
There are three principal divisions of Florida. East. Middle, and
West. The distribution of the employment to print the laws has
always been made heretofore with reference to these divisions, until
the last session, when one paper in East. Flo. & two in Middle Flo.
were selected, to the exclusion of West Flo entirely. The Pensacola
Gazette in W. Flo. had always before been employed, and I w”
respectfully suggest that the ancient arrangement be restored, in
order that the people of W. Flo. may have equaly with the rest of
the Terry. the advantage of a promulation of the public laws thro'
this accustomed channel of intelligence.
I would also respectfully recommend the appointment of the
Florida Herald at St Augustine, for East Flo. and of the Floridian
at Tallahassee for middle Flo.—Both these were the first newspapers
established in their respective districts, and having a wider circulation
than any other will allow a more general diffusion among the people
of the laws.

from Nathan Sargent Esqr * to you respecting a Brig at the mouth
of St Johns River (supposed to be) destined for Dunns Lake for the

instituted the necessary enquiry to ascertain if such a vessel is in
the St Johns & if so what is her object and destination, & if I find
there is such a vessel bound for Dunns Lake to procure Live oak
timber, I will use every effort to prevent her crew from committing
depredations on the public lands: it is proper however for me to
observe that there are upon this Lake a number of private claims
many of which have (or had) upon them valuable Live Oak timber
but I have not heared of any contracts lately for selling such timber
there. Agreabley to your request I herewith return the letter of Mr

HON. D. LEVY, House of Representatives.
SIR, I have the honor to inform you that although the utmost con-
fidence is felt by this Department in the activity and foresight of
Colonel Worth, and although it is believed that the most efficient
measures have been taken by him for the protection of the inhabitants
of Florida, and probably the very measures here deemed proper,
yet that instructions will go to him by this day's mail," to move down
one company of Dragoons from Thigpens," and the company from
Fort White,” and also to move up the two companies of Dragoons
now with him, and to place these troops South of the white settlements,
one company East of the St John’s and the others West of that river.
Orders have also been given to the Quarter Master General to provide
at least fifteen saddle horses at each post occupied by Infantry or
Artillery, if that number is not already there. And Colonel Worth
has been requested to renew his instructions to all the Officers under
his command, and particularly those in charge of posts, to keep scout-
ing parties continually out to watch the approach of any hostile
Indians, and to trace their steps.
Every officer in charge of a post, having already full discretionary
authority to employ all his force in expelling and destroying the foe
will he held as strictly responsible for the performance of his duty,
as if he were the Commanding Officer of all the forces assembled on
that frontier. In fact each one exercises a separate, and to a great
extent, an independent command."

DELEGATE LEVY TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR

WASHINGTON Jany. 5, 1841 [1842]
SIR I have the honor to acknowledge rec" of y' leter of today,
which has this moment reached me. While I recognize in it the dis-
position for which I have to thank you to afford protection to the
unfortunate inhabitants of the Florida frontier, let me take the liberty
to say that I regret you have deemed it necessary to that purpose to
withdraw the two mounted companies from Fort White and Thigpens.
Those two companies are well posted upon the usual war track of the
savages in their incursions into those parts of the country. The
company at Thigpens especially cannot be removed without leaving
the whole county of Nassau, and parts of Colombia and Duval Coun-
ties exposed to constant and imminent danger. It was placed there
only after sad experience of its necessity, and from the topography
of the country it is quite impossible that the company can be so
disposed of south of the settlements as to give any security whatever
to that region of country.
The employment of an active and constantly moving force along
the southern line of settlements is certainly desirable—and will be
useful, but let me beseech you not to supply that force by the with-
drawal of the two companies of dragoons from positions so important
to be maintained.
I regret exceedingly to be thus troublesome, but I am impelled
by a feeling which I know will a responce in your own bosom, that
of grief for the condition of the people I represent, and a desire to
arrest the further wanton sacrifise of life, You, may depend upon it,
Sir, that local experience and information are not unworthy to be
regarded, in aid of military arrangements, especially in respect to
hostilities of the charachter now waging in Florida.
The discretion of the officer charged with the protection of the
frontier is the best dependence for the success of that object. The
abandonment or occupation of particular positions, or the mode of
employing the force, cannot be safely prescribed here. The officer
on the spot can alone judiciously arrange these details. All that
can be done here, without danger, I would most respectfully suggest,
is to supply adequate means, and proper officers. A force of the
proper description, under an officer invested with free discretion in
the use of that force for the purpose of protection is what I have
ventured to ask for. Whether that officer was directed to report
to the Comm” officer in Florida, or directly to Washington, would be
immaterial; the great object being to have an active and zealous

under that letter, Col° W. will order the 2 troops of Dragoons
stationed in the north of Florida, to the South of the settlements—
unless he should feel certain that he has secured all the Creeks
who have been the murderers in that quarter heretofore. The
Col” if any of the Creeks remain out will probably order up
from the South two troops to the line across from Micanopy to S'
Augustine. The Floridians are most anxious to obtain two objects,
1. To get their men & horses in the pay of the U.S., 2. Failing in
that object, next to have as many of the U.S. troops placed on the
defensive as possible, & not to defend by offensive operations. The
longer the war can be protracted the better for them, provided that
the settlements are, in the meantime, protected by a sedentary
force. Winfield Scott Jan. 6, 1842. Nothing further in my opinion
can be done, to give protection to the settlements, than confide the
duty to the Commanding officer in Flordia who should direct the
protection as well as offensive operations and no force should be
employed to be independant of his authority. Nassau is one of
three routes which the Ind" have, heretofore used between the south,
or Ocklawaha, and the Okefonokee Swamp in Georgia—the last,
I believe, was in Aug. 1840. S. Churchill Ins' Gen Jan. 15. Adjt

HON. D. LEVY, House of Representatives.
SIR, Your note of the 5" instant was received yesterday. I
beg you to believe that any communications or representations

you think proper to make, particularly on the subject of the protection
of the inhabitants of Florida, so far from being deemed troublesome,
will be received with pleasure and considered maturely.
The term “instructions” used in my note of the 5" in reference
to the communications to Colonel Worth, is stronger than it should
be on the subjects of providing horses and continual scouting. Colo-
nel Worth was instructed and his attention was most urgently called
to the adoption and continuance of the most effectual means for the
protection of the inhabitants of Florida, and as one of those means,
the posting of the companies of Dragoons South of the line of settle-
ments. But the disposition of the particular companies was left
to his discretion. *
Upon the most mature deliberation, aided by your suggestions
and the counsels of the most able and experienced officers, I am
satisfied that means adequate to the protection of the Floridians,
and of the proper description have been furnished, and that they
are placed at the disposal of Officers on the spot who have free dis-
cretion—When I say adequate means, I intend all the means which
could be of any service without covering the frontier with a cordon
of troops placed as near to each other as they could stand. There
are now more thah twelve hundred men employed on the frontier
for the purposes of defence and protection while, the residue of our
military force is engaged in active pursuit of the enemy. More
than this can scarcely be asked. The nature of the warfare and the
character of the enemy render it impossible by human means to
furnish perfect protection. The sacrifice of life and the expenditure
of millions, already made for this purpose, attest the truth of the
remark.
I appreciate the feelings which excite you to make every effort in
your power for the relief of your constituents, neighbors and friends,
and with entire respect for your opinions, I must yet make allowance
for those feelings, which induce you to wish an impossibility to be
accomplished, and lead you to suggest means which will add little
or nothing to those now vigorously employed." J.C.S

SIR By a communication from the Secretary of the Treasury
of the 12" instant* in reply to a letter from this Office of the 8"
instant "submitting your communication of the 6" Ultimo " it appers
that your suggestion to reserve all the land between the town plan
of St Marks (Florida) and the Southern boundary of “Forbes’ Pur-
chase” lying between the Waculla and St Marks river, not otherwise
appropriated for the future extension of said town, has upon the
recommendation of this Office been submitted to the President and
approved by him, you will therefore please designate and return the
same on the plats accordingly.
As regards the approval of the surveys & locations made for certain
Indian Chiefs referred to in your letter, that is a matter requiring
the action of the Department of War, to which the attention of that
Dep" has been repeatedly called by this Office but on which the
necessary action has not yet been had.
This being the case I do not see that there is any good reason for
withholding payment of M* Mings account for the surveys provided
the work has been executed by him in a proper manner according to
your instructions.
In reference to the final adjustment of your Surveying accounts,
it has been delayed chiefly on account of the new difficulty attending
the item as now claimed by you for Office rent and fuel, presenting
a very large excess over the amounts heretofore claimed by you
in the regular estimates submitted with your past annual reports

THE TERRITORIAL JUDGES TO DELEGATE LEVY
[NA:HF, 27 Cong., 2 sess.:LS]
TALLAHASSEE Jan” 14. 1842
HON DAVID LEVY, Delegate in Congress, from Florida,
SIR Appropriations we learn have been made for Law libraries
for the Courts of appeals of other Territories, and we have been
informed applications from Florida, for a similar appropriation,
have been favorably acted upon by Congress, and perhaps granted
although the monies appropriated have never been applied.
Certainly there is no Territory where such appropriation would
be more useful. There are many important cases depending at
times in this Court in which the U. S. are interested. There is great
difficulty in the Judges obtaining law books here, as we are without
a public law library, and as it cannot be expected Counsel will except
in cases where they are concerned permit their libraries to be sent
to the Court House for the use of the Court.
We are informed the Legislative Council will apply for an ap-
propriation by Congress for a library for the use of this Court, and
we would respectfully request you to urge its allowance as necessary
to promote a proper and correct administration of the laws.
7 See Butler to Huntington, Jan. 10, 1842 (NA, GLO Lets from SG), trans-
mitting quarterly account for the 4th quarter of 1841, excepting salary accounts,

the retained part of the Forbes Purchase will be forwarded shortly. For the
latter, see Butler to Huntington, Jan. 15, 1842 (NA, GLO, PLC Incoming Corr.), in

SIR In the months of January & May 1840 this Institution loaned
to the Territory of Florida, Fifty Thousand dollars on the bonds of the
Territory signed by Robert R. Reid then Governor, & Thomas H
Austin Treasurer, for the purpose of paying the Militia expenses of
the Militia in the service authorized by the United States—These
bonds bear 8 proent Interest, the legal rate of the Territory & had
about ten years to run—but the full understanding was with the
Governor, that as Congress was to make provision for their payment
he would at an early period call their attention to it & he doubted not
they would be paid at the first or second session of Congress thereafter-
I am informed that the Gov did call the attention of Congress to
it, & we were sometime since assured that they would be paid soon-
The interest for the first year was paid out of the United States
Treasury, since which no claim has been made, mainly because it
was expected the principal would be paid soon-

If it can be made a Port of entry it will give some importance to the

should be added to it which of itself offers strong reasons for its con-

In relation to this Port you will find by the act 7th May 1822,”
Pensacola is the only Port at which a vessel can enter goods in

should also be extended to this Port For if goods are shipped
from any Foreign Port to this with the intention of reshipment

necessary to proceed to the St Johns River, after having done so,
and made due enquiry I am well satisfied that no such vessel has
gone up to Dunns Lake or even passed Jacksonville: the Brig Nimrod
from New York arrived at the mouth of that river between the 20"
and 30" of last November with about forty men on board who
were brought out by Mess” Palmer & Ferris (who reside upon the
St Johns River below Jacksonville) to cut Live Oak timber and I
have no doubt was the same vessel which Mr Cooper reported to

Mr Sargent, this Brig took out a Cargo of Live Oak timber, but it
was (so far as I can learn, all cut on private land; indeed there is
(said to be) but very little if any public land with such timber on it
in the neighbourhood where this cargo was cut, Mess" Palmer &
Ferris have at this time a number of hands cutting Live Oak in the
same region of country on private land with which they are said to
be loading another vessel at St Johns Bluff. These gentlemen have
been engaged in this business many years; have had several large
contracts with the Government & have always I believe been very
careful not knowingly to trespass upon the public lands, and theirs
is the only gang of hands that I have heared of, who are now engaged
in cutting Live Oak timber in this District. Should I hear of any
other I will endeavour to prevent their trespassing upon public
property: and shall deem it my duty to keep a vigilant eye upon
this branch of the public interest; untill another special agent shall

of Forts for defence, Light Houses for the safety of commerce, and
eligible points for the location of Towns, with a view to prevent

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF HAZARD

[Referred February 7, 1842]
DUVAL COUNTY, St Johns River East Florida
To the Hon. The members of the Senate, & House of Representatives, in
Congress assembled—
The Petition of the citizens of Hazard, & the adjacent country,
respectfully sheweth
That Your Petitioners, did on or about the sixth day of last March,”
address a Memorial to the late lamented President of the United
States. praying his sanction, to the removal of the Custom House
from Jacksonville, & the constituting of this place the Port of Entry,
for the District of Saint Johns—a copy of which memorial marked—
Exhibit A-,” is hereto annexed, & prayed to be made a part of this
petition.
That not long since Your Petitioners received a communication,
from the Hon T Ewing, Secretary of the Treasury, stating in reference
to the subject.” That said memorial had been refered to the Treas-
ury Department for action. that the act of Congress, of the 2" March
1831, establishing the District of Saint Johns,” requires—“that the
Port of Entry, shall be established at such point on the River St John,
as the President may direct.” That President Jackson, then in office,
selected Jacksonville, as the proper “point” consequently a change
cannot be effected, “without a special act of Congress, directing it to
be done”
Now, therefore, Your Petitioners, would respectfully petition, that
Your Most Honorable Body, do, at your present session, enact the
requisite Law, authorizing, & directing the removal of the Custom
House, & the establishing the Port of Entry, at this place–Having
without circumlocution, or any attempt at embellishment, set forth
in the Memorial the principal reasons that urge Your Petitioners to
seek the change; & the advantages that must thereby accrue, not
only to the Territory, but to the Federal Government, Your Peti-
tioners deem it superfluous to say more—though it may not be amiss
to add—that the channel of the River, is so very intricate that vessels

We the undersigned residents of Hazard, beg leave most respectfully
to Report—That save the old Spanish Fort, erected at the city of
S” Augustine, the sea coast from Savannah is exposed & unguarded.
That in the event of a War with any of the European Goverments,
no earthly power in our present defenceless state, could prevent the
landing of an army, & the consequent capture of this place & the
adjacent country. That the Saint Johns River, navigable almost
to its source, the Lands on either side surpassed by none in Florida,
the tide of emigration that must flow here, when Your Excellency's
decisive & energetic measures, shall have rid our beloved Country of
the merciless Seminole, & the Implements of Warfare, shall have
given place to the utensils of husbandry, require, in our humble
opinion, & we would respectfully ask of your Excellency, if the safety
& security of the people of Florida, & the Interest of the people of the
United States generally, do not also require, the erection of a Fort,
at the mouth of this River—
From the statements of the Pilots, we are convinced that at com-
paratively a very trifling cost, a “Break Water” could be constructed
on the Bar, that would permit the crossing (at low water,) of vessels
drawing Fifteen feet—This facility with the rapid settlement of the
Country, will warrant the arrival of many vessels. & though our
climate is superior to most others, for the general salubrity of its
atmosphere, we cannot but expect that seamen, exposed as they
necessarily are, to every vicissitude of heat & cold, will suffer from
disease, & as humanity & philanthropy, loudly call for it we would
suggest to your Excellency, the propriety of establishing a US
Military, & Marine Hospital, at this place—

TO THE HON SECRETARY OF STATE
DEAR SIR I take the liberty to renew the acquaintance formed
in the city of Richmond in Octr 1840; and also to inclose you the
Report and Resolution of the Legislative Council of this Territory
on the subject of the Salaries of the Judges.” I deem it unnecessary
to add one word to what the Committee have said, they sufficiently
set forth the reasons why the salaries of the Judges should be in-
creased. Yet I may properly say with regard to myself, that I
reached this place on the 25" of November, and entered upon the
discharge of my duties on the 29" of the same month; since which
time I have been engaged in Court from Ten in the morning, until
nine at night (and very often much later) I have disposed of Two
thousand cases, and as many yet remain to be disposed of. I shall
not be disengaged from the duties of the bench before the first of
June; and shall have disposed of Four thousand cases, common law,
criminal & chancery, having had a continuous session of six months.
When I first reached here I found much difficulty in conducting the
business of the Court. From the delay in executing the Laws,
society had become disorganized, and the best Citizens were unable
to withstand the threats of violence made by the offenders. I found
that it would require, firmness, promptness & decision, and that
it would be necessary to make examples of some of the more hardened
offenders, before the Laws & its officers would be respected. I
have pursued this course with unwavering firmness, and it affords
me pleasure to be able to say to you I have succeeded beyond my
most sanguine expectations Life and property is now secure, the
vicious have in many instances been taken and punished, in others
they have fled the Territory. I was at first threatened and when
that could not succeed, I was then coaxed, but when it was discovered
that at all hazards I would do my duty opposition yielded, and I
may say without vanity I have produced a reform which I trust
will be lasting

In this work I have been admirably seconded by my Mashal Maj.
Camp, who is fearless, ready & energetic
The last week I was engaged in a most laborious and exciting
trial. The trial of one of the accomplices in the murder of Gen:
Leigh Reid. The trial lasted four days & the Jury have not yet
agreed upon their verdict they have had the matter under consider-
ation for Three days—There was some expectation of an outbreak
upon this trial, but I took precautionary measures, & every thing went
off quietly. On reaching here I found my predecessors had left
the business of several years for me to transact, hence the very
arduous nature of my duties at this time. I beg leave to ask if
there is no way by which I could be paid for this labour which should
have been performed by others, and might may I not be paid my
travelling expenses out here, and those incurred in going around
my circuet. My salary will not meet my actual & necessary ex-
penses, and at the close of the year I shall be poorer than when I
took upon myself the duties of the office, there is no part of the
Union where living is so costly—The situation of this Territory
(especially) the Middle District; is most distressing. It is now
literally shingled over with Judgments: this County (Leon) is in-
debted to the amount of three millions. This arises from the ex-
travegant habits of the people—Some years ago when Cotton was
high, and the facilities of procuring money from the Banks great,
almost all mortgaged their property in whole or part; and the money
this procured was spent in luxury & extravegance & thus entirely
lost Now when the Banks themselves are ruened, and there can
be no relief from that quarter, it seems to me their situation is almost
hopeless. But this is a fine winter climate & they have a teeming
soil; and when they discard their extravegant habits & learn to
economise, the energies of the Country will & must revive. The
question of their admission into the Union as a state, seems to me
a very doubtful one even if they desire it. they are not in a situa-
tion to support a state Government & it would be an utter failure.
They have no sittled political creed it is all faction. Yet Whig
principles seem advancing with the great mass of the people as well
as I can judge from the prints & observation. My first quarters
Salary was due the 12" of January, but I have heard nothing from

WILLIAM J. WORTH TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL
[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., W 74:LS"]
H" Qurs Army of Florida TALLAHASSEE Feby. 14 1842.
GENERAL: I believe there has been no instance in which, in the
removal of indians, some, more or less, have not been left. This
unavoidably arises from their wandering life & habits, to which may
be added, in the case of the Seminoles, the peculiar character of the
country.
I have the honor to submit a statement of the whole number, Semi-
noles, Micasukeys, and Creeks" now at large, & their general range
or location *—This statement has been carefully prepared from the
examination of various indians, chiefs & others, of each & every tribe
& band, and at different times. Generally there has been a remarkable
concurrance in the statements; nevertheless, in case of discrepancy,
the highest number has been assumed. From this statement it
appears there are but three hundred and one indians, men, women &
children remaining scattered through the vast & almost boundless
swamps of this Territory, of whom, including the aged, incapable of
enterprise, and the younger, yet unaccustomed to the use of arms,
there are but one hundred and twelve men; a number, it is admitted,
sufficient, if kept in a state of irritation by constant & fruitless pursuit,
acting upon such & so sparse a population, to do much mischief. Of
the number stated, one hundred and forty-three are south, who have
never manifested a disposition to approach the settlements, and one
hundred and twenty are Creeks who were not original parties to the
contest. It may be here reasserted that every diminution of numbers
adds to the difficulty of taking the remainder.
The operations since June conclusively demonstrate to my mind the
utter impracticability of securing them by main force. The object
must be attained by pacific & pursuasive measures or not at all. Every
exertion of force, while it tends to make the enemy more wild in his
habits and savage in his nature, places the object in view, his total
expulsion, more remote; and yet the commander with so large a force,
who fails to give it the highest activity, disappoints an inordinate
public expectation, while by so doing he defeats the object. The
first step, in my judgement, towards closing the contest, if not finish-

assembled at Withlacoochee, had been dissuaded from coming in, and that other
Indians were to be transported to the West immediately. Two hundred and
thirty Indians were shipped on Feb. 5 (loc. cit., W 52).

ing it, is to reduce the force: this is being done to the extent to which
I have authority, & the immediate consequence will be a diminution
of five-sixths of the extraordinary expense. After the field operations
(which are general) now going on shall have terminated, it is my pur-
pose, unless otherwise ordered, to place the troops in positions to give
protection, and to limit myself to that object. Authority has been
asked to order out the remaining companies of the 2" Dragoons, and
by the 1" of May one additional regiment of Infantry may be dis-
pensed with. There will then remain three entire regiments & six
companies of a fourth regiment. There is a supply of forage & sub-
sistence in the country now equal to the wants of the present force of
man & horse for five months, which, on the reduced scale proposed,
will answer for eight or ten: and I beg that any further shipments may
be suspended until especially called for, and also, if necessary other
than under such orders as I may give, that Lieut Col. Whiting, head
of the Qur M" Staff, may be instructed as to the manner of disposing
of surplus—such as mules, horses, wagons &c.
I ask the instructions of the commanding General on these subjects,
& if my suggestions shall be approved, I then invoke authority to say
to these people, through friendly indians, that so long as inoffensive,
they may remain where they are, and plant & reap in quiet: meantime,
to permit the Arkansas delegates, and one or two of the chiefs, now in
our possession, whose tribes & families have been sent off, to go among
them, and at their pleasure reside with them, availing themselves of
the proper time & occasion to reason with, and explain to them their
true condition; not doubting that in a few moons they will thereby be
induced to come in and ask to be sent to their new homes. Quiet is
indispensable to their being made fully acquainted with their isolated
position, and also of their weakness, for such has been their dispersion
that they are yet to be convinced that many of their proximate & con-
federate bands have been sent to the West, & also that their strength
consists in their power to elude, not to combat their enemies. If this
authority be conceded, I propose further to grant them permission to
come freely to any of the military posts & trade without restriction.
It is proper here to remark, that measures are in train which give fair
assurance, that we shall, within the next month, have in possession
one third of the small number stated as remaining out.
While I am fully aware of the delicacy, I nevertheless feel it my
duty, respectfully, but seriously, to submit to consideration whither
it will be deemed public policy to prosecute this contest for results
so uncertain at expense so enormous, & whither the plan proposed
would not accomplish the object with equal credit to the country, and
more convenience to the Treasury.

I beg that the foregoing views & suggestions may not be considered
as arising from any indisposition of the officers or men composing this
army to prosecute the contest under any circumstances of duty or
hardship; on the contrary to be allowed to avail myself of this occasion
to testify to the zeal & energy with which all have, under every cir-
cumstance of difficulty & with singleness of purpose, donated them-
selves to the attainment of the object.
The main purpose of my coming hither was to submit this subject
generally to His Excellency Governor Call, & I have much hope of
his support & concurrance generally in the foregoing views—As there
are many points of detail connected therewith, which would be in-
convenient to embody in this report, as also the submission of some
explanatory maps, I have deemed it of sufficient importance, & also
that I may be more promptly & clearly of the views of the Major-
General Commanding in Chief, to dispatch Major Cooper, chief of
the Staff, to General Head Quarters. That officer is fully possessed
of my views & reflections upon the subject, & I request that entire
confidence may be given to any statements he may make in relation
thereto, & that after executing this duty he may be permitted to join
me without delay.
Treating of matters other than of military detail I have taken the
liberty, which I hope will be excused, of addressing this direct to the
General commanding in Chief.”

of the enemy, & is as distinguished for judgment & intelligence as
for zeal & energy. It is not doubted that, by his operations, the
112 warriors, yet remaining of the Florida Indians, will have been
considerably reduced, in number, before the end of April. Against
the few (if any) that may remain to be secured, after that period,
I propose the following means & measures:
Send away the five troops of the 2" Dragoons * & the 2" regiment
of Infy, which have been longest in Florida, & which are greatly
wanted elsewhere. There will then remain the 3" 7" & 8" regi-
ments of Inf & 6 companies of the 4* Inf, in all, 36 companies of
regulars, with these regulars, garrison some six or eight posts (for
supplies) on the exterior of, & within the theatre of operations.
Place the remainder (with an exception to be made) on a defensive
cordon—extending from Middle Florida across to S' Augustine,
along the southern line of settlements, & near those settlements.
Detach, from this cordon, from five to seven companies, at a time, to
act independently, each company with a few horses for packs & for
the sick & wounded—to scour the Indian country. Add, for active
operations, from five to ten companies of volunteers, each company
to be furnished with a few horses & to act independently, as in the
case of the regulars. Proclaim to all in the field, bounties as fol-
lows:—for every captured Indian warrior, $500; for every such war-
rior slain in battle or pursuit, $400, & for the capture of every other
Indian, $300. Allow volunteer officers to participate in those boun-
ties, but not regular officers. The latter, for extraordinary services,
can be rewarded by brevets. Give the same rewards to heads of
Indian families voluntarily coming in for emigration. Send in among
the enemy, friendly Indians to proclaim these terms, & thus mix
negociations of this character, with active military operations. See
Bill submitted by me to M* Secretary Poinsett in Dec. 1839 & Dec.
1840—now in the hands of the present Secretary of War. Volunteers
engaging to serve with a view to the proposed tariff of bounties, could
not fail to be highly efficient. They should not be mounted & only
be furnished, for the purposes above, with a few horses. This is the
plan of ulterior operations which I respectfully submit—in outline.

That since the construction of the Sea-Wall in front of the City, the

have hitherto scarcely been known throughout the whole period of its
history: That in the years 1839 & 1841, the fevers incident to most
of the Southern Latitudes raged with great violence cutting off in the
meridian of life, some of our most estimable and valued citizens: And
the general belief is, that these visitations are to be ascribed princi-
pally, if not altogether, to the Miasm that arises from the accumula-
tions that are naturally left behind the wall by the ebbing and
flowing of the tides;
And your Memorialists further represent, That it is the opinion of
our Medical men, that the filling up of the space behind the wall
would abate the nuisance as complained of by the Grand Jury of St.
John's and Mosquito Counties, as appears by their Presentment
hereunto annexed,” and restore to our City its wonted Character for
health.
Your Memorialists therefore respectfully pray, That your Honor-
able body would grant to the said City of St. Augustine, an appro-
priation of a sufficient sum of money to effect that object: and for
further information, your Memorialists would refer to such plans and
estimates as the Engineer department at Washington may be enabled
to furnish.
And your Memorialists, as in duty bound, &c.

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF MADISON
COUNTY
[NA:HF, 27 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[Referred February 14, 1842)
To the Honorable Senate & House of Representatives in Congress
assembled—
We the undersigned Citizens of Madison County, Middle Florida,
respectfully represent to your Honorable body, that it is extremely
essential to the interest of the inhabitants of this County that Cedar
Key, (that now in the occupancy of the Gen' Government, near the
mouth of the Suwannee river.). be made a Port of Entry. for the
Suwannee, that the cotton and other produce made for shipment in
the County, is transported over land by Wagons. at a great expense,
to Port Leon, now the nearest point for shipment—this mode of trans-
portation, is attended, not only with a heavy expense to the cultivator,
but with danger from the Indian enemy; to the property; The valu-
able lands within the limits of this County; the lines of which run for
the distance of one Hundred and fifty miles along the Suwannee
river, are rendered almost valuless to the owners—for want of nearer
point than Port Leon—for shipment of the produce, from them; We
also petition your Honorable body, for an an appropriation of a sum of
money to remove obstructions to the navigation of the Suwannee
river, to all of which, we respectfully ask of your Honorable body a
favourable Consideration. at the earliest practicable period—

the accounts of Robt. Butler Esq Surv. Gen' at Tallahasse Florida—
The sum of $10.000 was remitted to him by warrant N° 3149 bearing
date the 22" of April 1831.—It was discovered in the adjustment of
his accounts at this office in 1835, that he had credited $2000 less than
the amount of the warrant, nor did he credit the $2000 until after
Dec 1840, when another adjustment of his accounts was made—From
the fact that he promptly in his next quarterly accounts (after being
advised of the error) credited the U.S. with the amount of the dis-
crepancy, this office in answer to charges files against him by Mess"
Williams * & English "his former chief clerks, expressed the opinion
that the error in question was one of so glaring a character and so
easy of detection, that it must have originated purely in mistake—
that the very character of the error was calculated to rebut any impu-
tation of fraud on the part of Mr Butler—This was the substance of
the opinion then expressed—From the inclosed papers however,
(being copy of a letter from Mr Butler to this office of 23* Oct. 1841" in
answer to letter from this office of Oct. 13. 1841" a copy of which is also
enclosed, and a letter of the 27" of Jan. 1842” to the first comptroller
from this office with the answer of the Comptroller thereto, together
with voucher N° 2 of Rob" Butler Surv. Gen'in relation to office rent &
fuel) it will be seen that he has since charged in his accounts (2"
Quarter of 1841) $5595 for office rent and fuel, after having estimated
from time to time in his annual reports laid before Congress and
printed, only $2680 for the same, thus making a difference of $2915 in
his favor—This excessive charge has been rejected by the Comptroller,
and viewed in connection with the item of $2000 credited on the
account of the preceeding quarter, it is for you to say whether it has
not the appearance of being an afterthought, and a design on the part
of Mr Butler to indemnify himself at the expense of the U.S. for the
$2000–If the facts should justify such an inference it is manifestly
the duty of the President to transfer the important interests now
confided to him, to other hands.”

HONL: D. LEVY Delegate from Florida
SIR. The accompanying Memorial to Congress Signed by Citizens
of this vicinity has been placed in my hands to forward to you.
Every part of this Territory is so directly interested in the establish-
ment of defences along the Gulf Coast, that I feel very sure, from
your acknowledged zeal for your Constituents, this Memorial will
have your earnest attention; but it is the hope of the Memorialists
that under your auspices this measure so often urged and so long
neglected, may finally be examined and decided upon its merits
singly;—not in view of mere Territorial or local advantage, but as a
measure of great national Concernment, particularly addressing
itself in the present juncture of public affairs to the grave Consideration
of the Statesman and Legislator.
I have the honour to be Sir Very respectfully your ob st

Memorial to Congress by Citizens of Pensacola
[No date, 1842 c)
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives, in Congress
assembled:
The undersigned Memorialists, resident citizens of the City of
Pensacola, Florida respectfully represent to your Honorable Body,
that they deem it of the highest importance that no time should be
lost in putting in the best possible state of defence that portion of
our frontier, which borders on the Gulf of Mexico. On our whole line
of frontier, no one portion centers a deeper interest than that which
embraces the mouths of the Mississippi, Alabama, and Chatahoocha
Rivers, and in the event of misunderstanding with a foreign maritime
power, at no point would the enemy be so sure to rendezvous as at
that, where he could at once shut up, or cut off a vast portion of our

trade, and at the same time dangerously threaten the security of
our fellow citizens in the possession of their domestic property, guar-
anteed to them by the highest sanctions of the Constitution.
The unmolested trade by the rivers, alluded to, is not only of in-
dispensable importance to the numerous States which border on
them, but to the entire Country; for what State of the Union is not
more or less insterested directly in the trade which passes through
these natural channels? On every principal, then, of national in-
terest and patriotism, this unmolested intercourse must be protected
and secured.
Your Memorialist do not pretend to judge of the advantages of
any one point over another on that frontier, as best calculated to
effect this desirable object, but some one point, at least, should at
once be rendered capable of not only making a defence, but also
of furnishing a ready assistance and defence to other contiguous
points,—some port where repairs and supplies to our own Navy
could at any time be furnished without the absolute necessity, as
at present, for any vessel to resort to a distant northern or Atlantic
port for that object. The existence of such a rendezvous for our
ships, and an easy and rapid channel of communication by Railroad
with the interior, would be a matter of incalculable advantage.
A maritime force inimical to us might be disposed to attack an
isolated point, or one having no facile communication from the
interior, but would pause, and ponder well, before risking a blow,
however successful in promise, under a conviction that the triumph
would there be confined and limited, and without power to extend
it further against an accumulating defence which such channels of
communication would bring. Such a triumph would at best be
but precarious and temporary, and therefore not likely to be attempt-
ed. And your Memorialist would here hazard an opinion, that no
portion of our maritime border is less likely to be attacked by an
enemy than that, where he knows that internal communication exist to
promptly bring to the defence a patriotic population from the interior.
Nor would an enemy be able to hold a position in safety, or with
impunity, contiguous to a point of rendezvous for our own Navy,
thus provided with the means of defence and attack. Your Memori-
alists will not stop to inquire how far such a rendevous thus organized,
and aided by Railroad communication, squares with a rigid con-
struction of the constitutional powers of Congress—they know that
such an indispensable necessity absolutely exists, and most respectfully
urge on Congress, either a friendly aid to private enterprize ready to

East Florida, performed that duty, I beg leave to submit my account
for services rended & milage so that it may with other matters herein
mentioned, be laid before the President—If the act of congress ap-
proved May 23–(1828)" is understood by me, the President only is
impowed to decide on my account, and by his direction solely, such
allowance, or pay, to the law Agents, & assistant counsel, & district
Attorney as he may deem reasonable, can be made. If the President
thinks proper, to refer this subject to you, or any other officer of
Government, it will oblige me, should he not find leasure to examine
the subject—It is desireable that the whole subject of the duties
responsibilities, and expence of the several officers named, should be
inquired into—and according to their several duties, should in future
be the allowance to each.
By refference to the act of May 23" 1828. you will find that on
the Law Agent is in fact, placed the whole responsibity of superin-
tending the land cases in Florida, brought against the United States—
he is a traveling Agent, his duty is to procure the testimony, attend
every where, to take evidence, to prepare & argue the cases. through-
out the Territory and if required to attend the cases in the Supreme
court.—No other but the district attorney. can take testimony—the
assistant counsel under the law has no power to act except in arguing
the cases—When the President fixed the compensation for the assist-
ant counsel, Ric" K. Call was in fact doing all the duties—for Mr
Brents,” the then law Agent, was seldom in Florida,-and by reffer-
ence to the enclosed papers, it is apparent that Mr Call, was intitled
to all the compensation he received—The Present Assistant stib-
agent counsel Mr Burritt does not (from the records of the land cases
brought up to the Supreme Court) appear to have done any duty-
In the great case of Mirande vs The United States just decided, I do
not see his name in the record—The duty in this, and the other cases
was performed by the district Attorney Mr Douglass—yet the assist-
ant counsel, not leaving his home, at all, has continued to receive
annually $2,500, while the last Law Agent, (the late Judge Allen,")
was allowed only 1500 per annum & his travelling expences—when
he in fact with the district attorney done the whole business
The act of congress placed the assistant counsel and the district
attorney on the same footing—
It seems to me that under existing circumstances, a revision of the
allowances. heretofore made should be had, that the several officers
should be paid in proportion to there services & expenses, necassarily
incurred, in discharge of there duty—and as this is at all times in the
* Act approved May 23, 1828, 4 STAT. 284–286; see sec. 10,

power of the President, I trust it will be examined into—Judging from
the former action of the other presidents my account cannot be paid,
until approved by the President, & as his more important duties.
may not permit him to attend to this matter—he may refer it for
your report— -
The sum annually appropriated for the payment of Law Agent,
district Attorney, & assistant counsel, in $5000—There are a number of
land cases yet pending in Florida, against the United States, and no
doubt now remains, that the owners of the grants made by the King of
Spain, to the Duke of Alagon, Punon, Rostro, and Wargas, will soon
be in litigation, These grants cover nearly the whole Peninsula of
Florida, and hundreds of men of wealth, & influence, in the United
States are interested in maintaining these grants—
The necessity of engageing men of integrity & ability to defend the
interest of the United States against these enormous claims, is ob-
vious—I deem it my duty as I know it is the best for the United States
to recommend. William H. Brockenbrough, Esq of Florida as
assistant counsel, being a Lawyer of high reputation, and on whos
integrity, the government, can place the utmost reliance I have re-
ceived no allowance or compensation whatever since I was appointed
Law Agent—If the inclosed account for services, is allowed—my
future compensation—may commence from this date, as the President
may direct—with the understanding if I am requested to attend the
Supreme Court—that a reasonable allowance may be granted for ex-
pences &c—It seems to me that as I must reside at St. Augustine the
greater part of the year, where most of the land claims will be tried
that office rent, stationary &c should be allowed me—and some reason-
able amount may be added for this purpose—The inclosed extract of
Letters from the Attorney Gen. Mr Taney, & others with sundry ac-
counts. allowed by the then President obtained from the 1* Auditors
office, is sent also for the Presidents examination "

That they consider that the desperate condition of the Militia of
this Territory, and its perfect state of disorganization is mainly to be
attributed to the manner in which those officers are now commis-
sioned, being beyond the reach of any authority in this Territory,
and responsible alone to the Government of the United States, they
have no incentive to prompt them to the faithful discharge of their

and conduct of Robert Butler the Surveyor General at Tallahassee
Florida, I hereby enclose the copy of a letter from him bearing date
the 19th Ultimo" which has just reached this office, from which it
will be seen that he declines correcting his accounts, according to
the decision of the First Comptroller of the 1st Ultimo, a copy of
which was sent to him with instructions from this office; intending,
as he states in his letter, to submit the whole matter for your deci-
sion and direction.

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS AND
PLANTERS OF EAST FLORDIA79
[NA:HF, 27 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[March 1, 1842)
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States, in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the subscribers respectfully sheweth; That in
the year 1835. and previously thereto, they had become Inhabitants
and Planters in the Territory of Florida; that reposing Patriotic
and entire confidence in the Government of the United States, in
its obligations, as well as its ability and disposition to afford and
extend to them and to their possessions, a sure protection from the
Savage tribes inhabiting the interior of said Territory, they had
invested in their agricultural undertakings therein, their whole
property.
The history of this Territory and of the cruel and destructive Indian
warfare which has prevailed within it for more than the last six years,
need not be now recited for the information of Congress. It is but
too well known, that East Florida has been overwhelmed in ruin, -rav-
aged o'er and o'er again, by the yet unconquered and unrelenting savage,
and that your suffering Petitioners have thereby been reduced from
competency, —nay in many cases even from wealth, –to their present
unhappy and impoverished condition;—their Plantations being deva-
stated, their machinery, their cattle, their dwelling houses, their
" NA(GLO, Lets. to SG, VIII). Copy is present.
* See Huntington to Henry Washington, receiver, Tallahassee land office,
Mar. 1, 1842 (NA, GLO Lets. to Reg. and Rec., Bk. 15), that Butler's salary
account was to be adjusted before payment; his draft was not to be paid pend-
ing an accounting. See also post, p. 460.
* Enclosed in a covering letter of Mar. 7, 1842, from David R. Dunham, Gad
Humphreys, and W. H. Simmons to Rep. John C. Clark, of New York. The
writers of this letter also addressed one on the same subject to Rep. Joshua R.
Giddings, of Ohio, Mar. 10, 1842.

household furniture, their property of every description, all gone,—
being absolutely destroyed, or plundered and carried off by the
enemy;—even their very clothing, save that upon them, when com-
pelled suddenly to flee from the Rifle and scalping knife, in many
instances has not been rescued from the common destruction!
Will not the Congress of the United States take these grievous
matters into just consideration?—The war, and the desolation which
has followed in its train, are in no wise chargeable upon your Peti-
tioners, nor as they verily believe, upon any portion of the suffering
people of East Florida. To far other distinct and palpable causes,
these calamities may be readily and properly traced. And your
Petitioners therefore do humbly, but earnestly pray, that in con-
sideration of the matters above briefly stated, that Congress, the
legitimate, -indeed the only source to which they can look for relief,
in this their season of trial and prostration,-representing as they
do, a generous people, and having in charge for the public good and
the purposes of Justice, abundant means; will speedily provide by
Law, for the remuneration of those who have heavily and long suffered,
as your Petitioners have herein before set forth and shown.
For which purpose, your Petitioners in the most respectful manner
would suggest, that a Bill embracing the following provisions, should
be framed and passed. The first section, to provide for the organi-
zation of a Commission, consisting of not more than three members,
who shall be allowed a Secretary, and who shall be authorised to
receive the claims and ascertain the amount of losses sustained by
the Inhabitants of Florida, from and by the hostile Indians, as well
as by the operations of the Army,” during the present War; and to
report the same to be acted upon by the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Attorney General and the Solicitor of the Treasury as a final
and ultimate Tribunal. The next section, to provide for the holding
of the sessions of these Commissioners at such points or places, as
may be most convenient for the reception of claims and the exami-
nation of witnesses, and as well otherwise, best facilitate the duties
of the Commissioners.
The third section, to provide for the Issues of Scrip by the Treasury
Department, as the means of meeting and liquidating these claims;
the scrip to draw an interest of six per cent per annum, from the date
of the claim, or the period on which the property was destroyed.
By the fourth provision, the Public Lands in the Territory of
80 See J. M. Hernandez to the Secretary of War, Feb. 5, 1842 (NA,WD, SW
Reg. of Lets. Recd., H 50), presenting additional evidence in support of his claim
for sugar cane used and destroyed by the U.S. troops and asks its reference to
accounting officials that the claim may be recommended and finally settled.

Florida, to be pledged as the basis of this stock, which should be
made redeemable at the pleasure of the Government.
By a final provision, the scrip should be made receivable in pay-
ment for the Public Lands in the Floridas, when ever brought into
market.
From the information which your Petitioners have after careful
enquiry acquired, and from the most correct data they have been
able to possess themselves of, they have no hesitation in averring
the belief, that the aggregate amount of the losses, when ascertained
will not exceed, Two millions five hundred thousand dollars, certainly
not Three millions of dollars.
And your Petitioners relying on the magnanimity and justice
of their Government, anxiously but confidently look to Congress,
now in their great need, for its interposition in the adoption of some
measure for relief from that ruin, which without its aid must continue
to bear them down, and from which they cannot otherwise hope
to be relieved.

SIR I herewith transmit a Supplemental Report of the investiga-
tion of the affairs of this Office, during the continuance of my pred-
ecessor in Office.” It will be proper to remark, that this Investiga-
tion would have been completed long ago, but for the detention,
incident upon the want of the proper documents, which are in the
hands of the purchasers—who, as yet, have not felt interest enough
in the matter, to induce them, to exhibit the Receipts or even copies
thereof, at this Office.
It will be observed, that very little additional information has been
received here, since the Report which I had the honor to transmit to
your Department, under date of the 15" day of April—-1841: " To
which I beg leave now to refer.
It will be readily perceived, that in issuing Patents for Lands sold
at this Office, great irregularity and confusion might arise, from the
fact, that in many cases, different individuals, hold receipts for the
same Land—And again many Sales, made at this Office, will in all
probability, be set aside, for informality. And again, many tracts
which have been sold in a regular and legal manner, will upon a re-
survey, be covered by private Grants, which have been confirmed
by the Courts, since the Township Plats, were made and filed in this
Office.
It will also be perceived, that the evidence, in all the cases, herewith
reported, is not conclusive, that errors have been committed in the
entries herewith reported; but only shew that irregularities were com-
mon in the transaction of business in the Office.

The permanent expences of the law agency are at present too great—
considering the number of cases now pending there can be no necessity
for a principal and assistant agent let the assistant agency cease—and
the expences will be classed as follows
To the Law Agent $2000 per annum to commence on the 1. of
March (Instant) To the District Attorney $1500 for another year, -
at the end of which, if there be no decided increase of duty his com-

be remustered into service for three months.
* See the Adjutant General to the Secretary of War, Mar. 10, 1841 (NA,WD,
Reg. of Lets. Recd., A 56), that should he be called upon for a return of the militia
under the command of Leigh Read he would not be able to furnish it, as the re-
quired monthly returns had never been made. See also the Paymaster General
to the Secretary of War, Mar. 11, 1841 (loc. cit., P124), advising that no appro-
priation for the militia in Florida had been made during the present or past year,
and recommending that they be discharged as soon as their service can be dis-
pensed with. Charges of fraud in the accounts arising in the militia service in
Florida were made, and a board of officers was appointed to investigate the
accounts. See Henry Stanton to the Secretary of War, Feb. 28, 1841 (loc. cit.,
S392), and F. S. Dancy to id., Mar. 28, 1841 (loc. cit., D 81). See also act ap-

claims of Florida militia called into the service by the War Department in 1839
and 1840 for pay, subsistence and other items; the appropriation in question
totaled $166,242.20. See in this connection, the report of the Committee on

of the United States from March 1, 1841, to May 31, 1841. There is also a state-
ment of the number of Georgia militia men in service in October and December

With respect to the payment of the militia, I enclose herewith a
report from the Paymaster General;” and as regards the massacre
referred to I have to observe that the circumstances under which that
atrocity was committed, rebut the presumption of the insufficiency of
the protection provided for the settlement where it occurred. There
were two companies stationed in the vicinity of McClellan's settle-
ment in which Mr. T. resided. He left his home without giving his
house in charge to any one of his neighbors, and indeed without ap-
prising them of his intended absence; so that when the fire of the In-
dians was heard they thought it was the report of his own rifle. No
other house was attacked, for Mr. Tillis' alone was without protection.
The opinion of the settlers as to their security may be known from the
fact of Mr. Tillis' failure to observe a precaution but seldom neg-
lected in any country neighborhood, and the idea of danger must have
been distant indeed when the report of fire arms excited no suspicion
of the presence of an enemy.
No troops could have shown more diligence and activity than those
stationed at the settlement. They promptly followed, overtook and
captured some of the marauders, and at the latest advices were con-
tinuing the pursuit with prospects of further success.”

miles, nearer the Bay—The reason of this removal was altogether
on account of the change of the Commercial business from the former
to the latter place, and for the convenience of Master's to enter, & clear
their vessels, and it will likewise greatly aid the Collector in detecting
encroachments on the Revanue.
On account of the change of office I find great inconvenience in
getting my letters from St Marks—The Mails at that place are very
irregular, and the office not attended to at all—I believe my letters
constitute, at least, three fourths of the contents of the Mail Bag—I

I have the honor the he her to submit the following statement
In November last while at Tallahassee Florida—I was requested
to attend the late Supreme court in the city, to argue in behalf of the
united states certain land causes. then pending in that court—This
has been done on other occasions and counsel from Florida attended
and were paid for such service under the powers given to the President
by the same law—In one or more instances where the suits were im-
portant. President Jackson during his administration. in certain
land suits employed. Rich" K. Call, and the late Mr Wirt to assist
the attorney General, and they were paid by his order. I have per-
formed the same service, and one of the causes set up a claim for three
hundred and sixty eight thousand six hundred and forty acres of land.
taking in contonment Brooke, the falls of the Hillsborough river, and
the most important points on the shores of Tampa Bay in East
Florida—For national defence. & for naval purposes the land then in
controversy, is worth millions of dollars There were, six cases, in the
Supreme Court. five more argued and decided. on, two were confirmed,
two, reversed in part and remanded to the court below for further
action & resurveys One case was continued by the court untill the
next term. These cases were for sixteen thousand acres of land each.
There is now pending in the superior court of East Florida twelve,
land causes—they are will be tried next October. Suits are about
to be instituted by claimants against the United States on three

large grants, which cover a large portion of the Florida peninsula,
involving several millions of acres—The value and importance of
these lands to the United States, induced the President to appoint,
me the law agent for the land claims in Florida—The duty of the Law
agent is confined to not particular in Florida, he is to attend any
court, where a suit is brought against the united states, with the Terri-
tory. He is to take the evidence every where throughout Florida,
for the united states, and to superintend all the testimony which may
be taken by the claimants, to collect all record evidence that will
protect the interest of the united states and to argue the cases—The
duty of the district attorney is to answer all petitions or bills, filed
by the claimants, to draw up the pleadings, in defense, and from time
to time, under the rules of the court, to take the necessary steps in
the suits, se as will place them early on the trial dockett—The duties
of the district attorney, require him to remain in his district and he
does not attend elseware—The assistant counsel was not authorided
by law to any thing else that argue the cases—His allowance was
$2500 per annum, but the President thought his services were un-
necessary, & that agent, is discharged—sometimes there is no Law
Agent—whenever the suits are of little consiquence, the services of
the law Agent is dispensed with—The President under the law exer-
cising such discression, as economy & the interest of the country may
require. The allowance to the Law Agent is $2000 per annum, If
he should be obliged to travel much over the Territory, in performing
his duties—the expense will Hatteh reduce his compensation—and
should he visit, Pensacola and Key West—and thence back to St
Augustine—but little if any, of his allowance will be left. His ex-
penses cannot be fixed as that must depend on the nature, and extent
of the duties he may perform

Having procured an introduction to the late Surveyor General
thro’ Gen. Brown, I presented the Official letter with which I was
charged by your Department.” He informed me that he would
proceed with the Inventory directed, but that some days would prob-
ably be consumed in the labor of making the list & copies required.
To day, tuesday, I was summoned to the Surveyor Generals Office,
to compare the Inventory with the articles enumerated. This task
I have performed to the best of my ability & have accordingly signed
the receipt.
At the close of our interview Col. Butler placed in my hands a
letter which he said had reference to the Office hitherto used by
him & about which I had declined to communicate with his clerk
the day before. I promise to give it a careful perusal. On this
subject he says “Considering my property as rented to the U.S. for

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO DELEGATE LEVY
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 24]
WAR DEPARTMENT April 26th 1842.
HON. D. LEVY, House of Representatives
SIR, In answer to your letter of the 24" instant, received to day,”
I would say that, in my opinion, the occupation of the peninsula
of Florida by a hardy and armed body of men, would be the most
effectual means of preventing any hostile incursions by the Indians.
Their number is now so much reduced, that the trouble and expense
of keeping a large military establishment there for the pursuit and
capture of the few that remain, seems no longer expedient." A
force ten times the number of those now in the field, would not pre-
vent occasional irruptions of the Indians, and if it can be prevented
by any means, that above suggested, appears the most effectual.
And if to secure such settlements, it be necessary to offer a quarter
section of land to each head of a family, I should think it judicious
to make the offer, but with the express declaration that the title
of the United States only would be granted, and that the Govern-
ment would not be responsible for any failure of title.
It might also be expedient to authorise the issue of rations to the
families of such settlers as were in need of them for a term not ex-
ceeding one year, and the loan of arms on security being given or
* NA (GLO, Lets. to SG, IX), that Butler's accounts would be adjusted within

T. HARTLEY CRAWFORD TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Apalachicola:LS]
WAR DEPARTMENT Office Ind. Affairs April 28th 1842.
SIR, By treaty, concluded on 18 June 1833,”—with the Apalach-
icolas—the United States Agreed “to grant, and to convey in
three years by patent to Mulatto King or Vacapasacy; and to Tustu-
nuggy Hajo, head chiefs, of Ematlochees Town for the benefit of
themselves, subchiefs, & warriors, a Section and a half of land to
each, or contiguous quarter and fractional Sections, containing a
like quantity of acres; to be laid off hereafter under the direction
of the President of the United States, so as to embrace the said
chiefs fields and improvements, after the lands shall have been surveyed
and the boundaries to correspond with the public surveys, it being
understood, that the aforesaid chiefs may, with the consent, and
under the advisement of the Executive of the Territory of Florida,
at any time previous to the expiration of the above three years,
dispose of the said Sections of land and migrate to a country of their
choice.”
To carry into effect that portion of the treaty requiring the lands
for the Chiefs to be laid off under the direction of the President,
instructions were given by the Commissioner of the Gen. Land
Office, who has transmitted to this Office a copy of the report of
the Surveyor General with a map indicating the tracts which have
been selected as the reservations aforesaid. The following is the
designation of the tracts, the selection of which is recommended
for the Presidents confirmation by the Surveyor General.

Neither reservation amounts to the quantity usually contained
in a regular section and a half, but that is accounted for by the treaty
requiring the boundaries of those reservations to correspond with
the public surveys, the regular subdivision of which does not make
the exact number of acres.
The Surveyor General reports that he could not obtain any data
to make a division between the respective Chiefs improvements, but
has marked on the map the proposed subdivision by a yellow shade—
That division causes the land to be distinguished as the North &
South reservations—For the South division claims have been pre-
ferred by deeds confirmed by the Executive of Florida—The ap-
proval of the President sanctioning the act of the Surveyor General,
is now necessary to authorize the General Land Office to issue pat-
ents under the deeds—and to proclaim for sale the balance of the
land.”

shall have much trouble with the squatters, as they have principally
settled, & will continue to do so, on the best Live-oak & timber Lands

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE COMMANDING
GENERAL
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 2411]
WAR DEPARTMENT May 10" 1842.
Memorandum for Commanding General,
The communication of Colonel Worth of the 14" February last 12
and the suggestions of the Major General commanding the Army
contained in his letter of the 27" ultimo,” in relation to the state of
affairs in Florida, and the continuance of hostilities there, have been
maturely considered, and I have now to communicate to the Major
General commanding the Army, the views of the President upon the
subject.
The very reduced number of the hostile Indians now in Florida,
believed not to exceed two hundred and forty, including probably
eighty warriors, would seem to indicate that all has been accomplished
which can be effected by the employment of a large military force in
offensive operations. Unless such operations are to be continued
until the last Indian in the Peninsula shall be destroyed or captured,
there must be some period when they should cease. That period, it
is believed, has now arrived, and the protection of the inhabitants
must be secured by other means, which it is believed can be effec-
tually employed for that purpose.
The season is approaching which forbids the active and energetic
movements which have distinguished the Army in Florida particu-
larly during the last year, and the course of measures intended to be
pursued must now be determined.
The communications of the Governor of Florida, of many of its
intelligent citizens and of various distinguished officers of the Army,
corroborate the views expressed by Colonel Worth of the propriety
of terminating the present system of hostilities with the few Indians
remaining in that Territory.
Anxious to curtail the extraordinary expenses incident to the warfare
and sincerely desirous of promoting peace, the President directs that
Colonel Worth be authorised, as soon as he shall deem it expedient,
to declare that hostilities against the Indians in Florida have ceased,
and that they will not be renewed unless provoked by new aggres-
sions on their part. And they will accordingly cease until their re-
newal be authorised by the proper authority. But this is not to be
understood as forbidding any acts of self defence either by the troops
or by citizens, against any attempts of Indians to molest them.

Such a reduction of the Military force in Florida as may be made
consistently with the protection of the inhabitants will therefore,
immediately be made, and the troops ordered out of the Territory,
will be stationed as the exigency of the public service may require.
But it is deemed advisable that a force, equal to at least two regi-
ments, be retained to form a cordon or line of protection for the fron-
tier settlements. The action of Congress will be invited to aid in the
defence of the Territory, by the settlement of our citizens there, and
offering to them inducements for such settlements, by gratuities of
land, by allowing them rations for subsistence and by the loan of arms.
Until the decision of Congress is had on the subject, it is desirable
that the settlements to be made, should be within such line of pro-
tection as shall be established by Colonel Worth who will take the
necessary measures to effect this arrangement.
He will also use the means he possesses of communicating with the
Indians yet remaining, and inducing them to consult their true inter-
est by joining their brethren at the West.
Shipments of forage and subsistence to Florida will be suspended
until expressly called for by the Officer in Command there.
The Quarter Master General will instruct the senior officer of his
Department in Florida as to the manner of disposing of the public
property that may not be required for use under the arrangements
now directed, such as mules, horses, wagons &c subject to the orders
of the Officer commanding the Army in Florida.
Colonel Worth will be informed that the Naval force on the coast
has been directed by the Secretary of the Navy, to withdraw, when-
ever the Commanding Officer in Florida shall declare the cessation
of hostilities, and shall deem their services no longer necessary.
The Major General commanding the Army will please communicate
these directions to Colonel Worth, and give such further and other
orders as may be necessary or proper to carry into effect the views
of the President.”

GOVERNOR CALL TO DELEGATE LEVY

TALLAHASSEE 10" May 1842
SIR I have the honor herewith to enclose a copy of the General
presentment of the Grand Jury for the County of Leon. I can
add nothing to the impressive, and forceable discription given in
this document of the embarrassment, and pecuniary distress of the
people of Middle Florida. And can only unite with the Grand
Jury in recommending the adoption of the only measure calculated
to procure the necessary relief. If the executions now in the hands
of the Marshal are enforced, a thousand defendants must be utterly
ruined, while scarcely one Plaintiff will recieve the tithe of his debt.
If authorized by Congress, an election of members, might be held
in October, and the Legislative Council might be assembled on the
1* Monday in November. This would enable the Legislature to
interpose before the return of the executions to the November term
of the Superior Court, and the prospect of such an interposition,
would in the mean time, in all probability, have the deserved effect
of suspending sales under execution and the consequent sacrifice
of property

General Presentments of the Grand Jury of Leon County

The Grand Jury of Leon county in bringing their short but laborious
session to a close, have to remark with pain upon the present calam-
itous condition of the country. Excessive speculation, and the
inordinate issues of local Banks, have here, as elsewhere, been fol-
lowed by wide-spread ruin. The extent and degree of distress is
indeed, when taken in connection with the failure of several successive
crops, and the great depreciation in the value of cotton, almost
without a parallel. There is no money in the country. Fifteen
hundred executions are said to have issued from our Courts within

the last five months, and it is a well known fact that there is not
in the country specie enough to pay on these the legal fees of the
officers of the Court.—What, then, must be the sacrifice of property!
Sales have already occurred in which, in ordinary times, the property
sold would have proved more than sufficient to cover judgment
and costs—and what has been the result?—The plaintiff in one
of these cases, by way of illustration, received about one-thirtieth
of his original claim, one-tenth of the entire amount of the sale;
and the other nine-tenths were required to defray the costs of suit
and collection. But dreadful as this result appears, it is but the
feeble commencement of the utter destruction that is speedily to
follow. And is such a condition of affairs to be tolerated?—Are
the people to sit tamely by, and behold one by one of their number
stripped of their property—of their only means of subsistence?
and for what? Their debts are not paid—their property is gone,
and neither plaintiff nor defendant benefited by the sacrifice. Is
there then no remedy? The conciliating policy, the recommendatory
measures of public meetings—partly from the inability of those
entrusted with collections from abroad to grant the required in-
dulgence, and partly from the rapacity of others—must entirely
fail. The arm of the Legislature has, so far, been extended in vain.
The present stay law is of small benefit, except to that class who
did not greatly need its assistance. What, then, can be done? The
resort to force is ever to be deprecated—but the Grand Jury believe
that a more vigorous exertion of the Legislative arm is loudly called
for; and that unless active measures are taken to invoke its aid, a
state os things may and must ensue which every law-abiding citizen
would deeply deplore. It is far better that the representatives of
the people should interfere, and cover with the Legislative sanction
a restraint alike wholesome and necessary to creditor and debtor,
than that an open resort to violence should be allowed to ensue.
Deeply impressed with the reality and importance of this conviction,
and anxious to avert the scenes of bloodshed and ruin which threaten
to overwhelm this community, the Grand Jury of Leon county
earnestly recommend to their fellow citizens, and to the people of
Florida generally, a memorial and petition to his Excellency the
Governor of this Territory, and through him to their Delegate in
Congress, setting forth in strong and respectful language the evils
complained of, and urging upon them the importance and necessity
of the immediate passage by Congress of an act authorizing the
Governor of this Territory to convene, as soon as practicable, the
Territorial Legislature, to take into consideration such measures
for the relief of this people as it might be expedient to adopt in the
present crisis: and the Grand Jury do hereby for themselves, and in


## p. 475 (#487) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 475
behalf of their fellow citizens, respectfully and solemnly solicit the
co-operation of the Governor of this Territory, and of their Delegate
in Congress, in the procurement of said act.
The Grand Jury present as an evil growing out of Territorial de-
pendence, the melancholy system of proscription that has prevailed on
the part of the General Government in their relations with this Terri-
tory during the last four years, and as evinced in the repeated and
unjust removal from office of Territorial officers distinguished alike
for probity and ability. If the faithful discharge of the duties of an
office is to be no longer a guarantee for its continuance, it is high time
that the appointment should revert to the people of the Territory:
and the Grand Jury do therefore seriously and solemnly recommend to
their fellow citizens the adoption of measures, as soon as constitu-
tionally practicable, for the organization of a State Government.
In connection with the present distress of the country, and as greatly
aggravated by it, the Grand Jury consider it their duty to present the
enormous multiplication of legal process in the prosecution of suits, as
an intolerable grievance, and one that calls loudly for legislative amend-
ment. As an evil of the same character, and requiring the same re-
dress, the Grand Jury regard the practice of marshals and sheriffs,
in sales under execution. The property sold is so infinitely divided by
being distributed for sale on different days of the week and month,
that no concourse and competition of bidders can ever be expected,
and consequently the sacrifices must be great. The Grand Jury re-
spectfully recommend to the Marshal, as an act of justice to all parties,
to set apart some one day and period of the month, on which all sales of
property shall hereafter be made; and that this practice be observed
until the Legislature can act on the subject.
The Grand Jury deem it, also, their duty to call to the attention of
the Honorable Judge of the Superior Court, the entire insufficiency of
the security on both of the present Marshal's bonds, as a matter de-
serving immediate and special notice. Nor does the inadequacy of
these bonds apply only to the sureties.—The amount fixed by law,
the first to the U. S., being a bond for $20,000, and the second to the
Territory for $10,000, is utterly insufficient. A bond for 50,000, well
secured, would scarcely afford a sufficient guarantee for the safety of
the immense sums which, in the present condition of affairs, must
in the process of collection, pass through this officers hands. The
Grand Jury consider this an evil of the first magnitude, jeopardizing
alike the rights of plaintiff and defendant; and when it is recollected
that the Marshal of the adjoining district lately availed himself of the
circumstance to withdraw from the United States with a large amount
of the public money, too much importance cannot be attached to it.
The Grand Jury consider it a solemn duty to direct the attention of
the proper authorities to the subject, and through our Honorable

Judge and our Delegate in Congress, to request a prompt redress of the
grievance.
The Grand Jury also present, as a serious injury to the country, the
delay of the General Government in the payment of its debts to the
citizens of this Territory; and they respectfully request their Delegate
in Congress to press upon that body the speedy liquidation of these
claims; and they would further urge upon his attention the fact, that
it will greatly tend to relieve the pressure and distress occasioned
here by the almost total absence of a circulating medium, if these
payments be made in the notes of specie paying Banks, specie or
Treasury notes, instead of checks upon remote Banks.
Under the head of County business—
The Grand Jury present as a matter worthy of censure and pros-
ecution, the long-standing negligence and inattention of the Board
Commissioners of this County, and they advise that, unless a material
alteration takes place under the recently appointed Commissioners,
that proceedings shall be instituted against them, by the District
Attorney, at the Fall Term of this Court. The Grand Jury have, in
the course of their duty, inspected the County Jail, and report with
much satisfaction, and as highly creditable to the Sheriff and Jailer,
its comfortable and cleanly condition. They recommend to the
County Court the removal of the sheet iron lining, as a perfect nui-
sance, occasioning ill-health, and decay of the inner timbers; and they
strenuously advise also the speedy erection of a proper enclosure as a
precaution of safety and cleanliness.
In conclusion, the Grand Jury of Leon County, tender in behalf of
themselves and the community, to the Honorable Judge of the Superior
Court, their thanks for his able and eloquent charge, and for his
energetic enforcement of the laws. Their thanks are also due to the
District Attorney and Marshal and other officers of the Court, for
their uniform courtesy and attention. The Grand Jury request of
the Court that this their General Presentment, may be published in

The instructions are so much in detail that but little remains to
be added.
The manner of declaring the cessation of hostilities to the Indians,
the troops & the inhabitants, to take effect on a day to be fixed,
is left to your discretion.
An early report from you, after making up a definitive judgment
as to the amount of force (not less than the Secretary has designated—)
deemed necessary for the defensive purpose indicated—as well as
the cordon to be occupied by such force—is requested.
It is not expected that the cordon should be a regular line, either
curved or straight. It may be, in parts, zig-zag, with certain isolated
or advanced posts—as Fort Mellon," Tampa Bay &c.—so as the
better to cover or protect the inhabitants, & to secure ultimately, by
persuasion or negociations, all the remaining Indians, for emigration.
General Orders, No. 26, of yesterday, directs the embarkation of
the 2* Infantry for New York, & leaves to your discretion the
time for sending eight companies of the 7" Infantry to relieve de-
tachments of the 3" Artillery, therein designated. It is not deemed
probable that you will soon give orders to that effect.
We have just received unofficial intelligence that you have realized,
in great part, the happy results which you had anticipated, in your
last official report, from the late spirited affair with Halleck Tuste-
nuggee & other energetic operations.

What force will be needed, after the cessation of hostilities with
those Indians, in order to carry out the views of the War Department?
The five troops of the 2" Dragoons: Can they be dispensed with?—
or other, & what part of your remaining forces?
If you are confident (after giving reasonable weight to the opinions
of Floridians) that the Dragoons may be spared, you will, without
waiting for further instructions, designate two troops for the post
at Baton Rouge, under the Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment, &
the remaining three for Fort Jesup, & put the five in motion for
those respective stations—taking care to advise Brigadier General
Taylor, at Fort Smith, of the approach of the three troops to his
department, as also of the route given them, so that he may, on the
route, change their destination if it should be deemed necessary
either there or here.
Should you, in your judgment, or in deference to the opinions of
the inhabitants of Florida, deem it necessary to retain a part of the
Dragoons, say three troops, & not the whole, you will, in either
case, send off the other two troops to Baton Rouge, with, or without
the Lieutenant Colonel, as you may deem his presence most useful
there, or in Florida.”

[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 24]
WAR DEPARTMENT May 12” 1842.
COLONEL W. J. WORTH, Commanding the Army in Florida.
SIR, The present condition of affairs in Florida, renders it proper to
vary the instructions heretofore given under different circumstances,
in relation to slaves in possession of the Indians who may surrender.
Compacts and stipulations made with them, must be adhered to.
It is equally the dictate of honesty and of policy to convince them of
the good faith of the Government, and thus deprive them of any
pretext for treachery on their part. This Department therefore does
not feel at liberty to authorise any departure from engagements here-
tofore made with the Indians in Florida, on the subject of any property
in their possession, whatever may be its character.
But the necessity which dictated former instructions having ceased,
no assurances are hereafter to be given them that they may retain any
slaves or other property, but such as belongs to them. Should cir-
cumstances, however, render it absolutely necessary for them to carry

away to the West any slaves or other property, to which their strict
legal right may be doubtful, it will be highly desirable, in all such cases
to make an arrangement with those citizens who may have adverse
claims, to obtain their assent to such removal. Any expenses that
may attend such arrangements, will be chargeable to the funds ap-
propriated for removing those Indians and for suppressing hostilities
in Florida.
The instructions heretofore given you will be your guide as to the
manner of ascertaining the proper persons with whom to make the
arrangements and the amount of expense which ought to be incurred.”

SIR. I have just returned from St. John's Bluff about 25 miles
below this place, where I went for the purpose of examining that
section of the Country, where the timber cutters have been operating
during the last winter, & this spring.
I find that great quantities of Live-Oak & saw logs have been cut
from the bar up to this place upon each side of the river, but mostly
up the various creeks for the distance of fifteen to twenty miles.

There appears to be so many claimants for all good timber lands,
predicated on Spanish Grants, (Some locations I am informed being
covered with three or four diferent grants,) that it is impossible for
me to designate public from private lands until I procure from the
Land Office at St. Augustine, the locations of Lands sold there; And
from the keeper of the Archives at that place the original boundries
and locations of these old Spanish grants, confirmed by Government.
& I shall immediately proceed there for that purpose.
In some cases it will be necessary for me to resort to the assistance
of a Surveyor, as it is my intention to prosecute some of the most
wealthy individuals in this community for innovations upon the pub-
lic Timber, when I am confirmed in my suspicions of their trespassing
upon the public Lands: I shall take no steps of this kind until I have
arrived to certainty, as I consider it unnecessary to run the Govmt.
into useless expense.”
I have been informed by Messrs. Palmer & Ferris, (Govmt. con-
tractors) that it is their intention to cut timber during the next season
on Lakes George, Munroe, & Jessup, or in their vicinity: Major Tay-
lor & other setlers have offered the timber to them for sale.
I must ask to be advised in regard to the course I am to pursue to-
wards these settlers, they have located themselves there by the in-
vitation of Col. Worth & have received arms and rations from the
Govmt. My object for asking separate instructions in this case is,
that I do not wish to take any steps which might interfere with Col.
Worths' operations to close the present Indian War.
There are also three settlements of considerable note on the Gulf
side, the Homassassa, containing about 40 inhabitants, the Choco-
hatee, containing about 300, and the Anuttelega. Also several other
small settlements, all of which I shall visit so soon as I receive advice
from the Depmt.
The face of the Country on the Gulf side I am well acquainted with,
it is covered with very large & valuable Live Oak timber & some large
& thrifty white oak, well calculated for ship planking as it is as tough
as walebone, this is the description of Lands which have been located
by these settlers.
As nigh as I can ascertain, Majr. Taylor has induced them to be-
lieve that they are entitled to the timber, and that Govmt. has no
authority over it.
I can not too strongly recommend a general survey of this country,
as it would be very beneficial to Govmt. & would tend in a great
measure to drive the Indians from the Country, and enable the Depmt.
to reserve all the valuable timber Lands.

My views upon this subject are confirmed by the opinion of Mr
Douglass, the District Attorney.—This survey I am confident, might
be accomplished with safety by employing a force of 150 or 200 men.
Doubtless the Depmt will concur with me at least in the opinion
that the unsurveyed portion of this country should be immediately
surveyed, not only for the purpose of reserving valuable timber Lands,
but in order to designate public from private property.
In former surveys, either from the negligence of the surveyors, (as
they surveyed by the mile) or that of property holders in not properly
filing their their claims, public & private Lands were run out together
without any mark to designate them apart, —This accounts for the
various litigations which are now pending in regard to Lands & timber
this proposed survey would save to the Government more than five
fold the cost of the same.
I have endeavoured in some cases to find the original corners of
sections, but as the land marks have been designated by small stakes,
or in some cases on saplings, & pine trees, which have been destroyed
by fire, or decayed, my search has been unavailing; and I have been
informed by Mr. Douglass, & other gentlemen, in whom I can place
undoubted confidence, that they have searched for corners of Town-
ships & sections & could not find them from the before mentioned
circumstances.
I would recommend in future that these marks be designated by
pitch-pine, cedar or cabbage-tree posts, not less than 8 inches or a
foot square, & formed into a mound with sand or other earth.—By
this method they never could burn, & would always be designated—
We have undoubted testimony that these mounds will neverwashaway,
from the circumstance that traces of cultivation still remain in fields
which have not been improved for the space of a century—
Should the Depmt. deem it practicable to furnish me with, or direct
me where, I could procure a chain & compass it would be useful to me
in designating private from public property, which I could do within
myself in many cases
As I intend soon to operate in the interior of the Country, I would
like to be advised where I can procure Arms, Ammunition & tents.
When at Palatka I could procure neither of these articles, not even
a pound of Gun-powder.—Col. Worth was not at the post, & I have
not had an interview with him since I have been in Florida—
I omitted to mention in my communication of the 9th. that I was
severely injured in the back while on board of the Steam-boat, You
will perceive however I have not been idle on account of it, I am now
now pretty much recovered.
Instead of making my head Quarters at St Augustine, I have lo-
cated them at Jacksonville, as the river St. Johns is the key of East

SIR, On the 19" ulto I advised you by letter * and accompanying

surrendering in good order all my responsibilities into the hands of

mitting a new set of accounts, as on failure within a given period to do
so, that you will adjust my accounts without making any allowance
(for that which has been allowed to others) that suit may be instituted
against me to recover what may appear to be due the United States-
Having regularly transmitted my accounts, surrendered the Office
with its documents, closed my functions as Sur General and retired,

faithfully, and if you deem it a part of your duty to pursue the course
intimated (I had almost said threatened) I have only to bow in submis-
sion and prepare for my defence as becomes a Freeman jealous of his
rights—I have to regret that the Hon” Secretary has not afforded me
the grounds for his adverse decision, when the provisions required by
his former one were clearly filled by me. In the event you shall
finally determine on the course stated, I will thank you for copies of
your two letters, the first to the Acting 1* Comptroller of the Treasury
upon which his opinion was founded as expressed in his letter to you of
the 1* of Feb" last.”—Second your communication to the Secretary of
the Treasury under date 1" of March last,” as acknowledged by him
on the 16" Ult” and to advise me of such determination at your early
convenience that I may be prepared on the institution of the suit, to
sue out interrogatories for you and the Chief Clerk with the 1* Comp-
troller of the Treasury to respond to and otherwise to obtain the
necessary papers touching this claim together with another which will
be advanced (under advice of Consel) for a considerable Sum against
the United States, which the institution of a Suit will enable me to lay
before a jury of my country for their decision—It may also be neces-
sary, for me to visit Washington City before the trial. I would re-
spectfully request that a warrant be issued in favor of M*A.A. Nunes
Draftsman for his Salary for the 1* Quarter of the present year which
remains unpaid. As my constitution has been much broken in the
Service of my Country and my health at present impaired by the in-
justice heaped upon me, I feel solicitous that this business may have a
speedy termination, as it would be a painful reflection to me, if I
should be called off, to leave a large and helpless family encumbered
with a Suit against me infering that I was a Defaulter to my Country
when the reversed picture is the true one. Leaving this subject for
your final determination I revert to another.
The President has thought proper through you to supercede me
as Surveyor General and (as I am advised) refuses to give any reason
for the act—As he certainly would not violate his Manifesto published
to the Nation, nor yet dismiss me without cause, I am therefore
bound to believe that representations have been made to him secretly
of a magnitude sufficient to induce him to dishonor me in the sight
of the world, and as he refuses all information on the subject, I have
as the only alternative left me to say through you to the President
as becoming a faithful Officer and Gentleman that such information

(if given him) is false and malicious come from what source it may.
The President exercises the right of expounding the Constitution
for his official action and has placed himself in the attitude that the
“King can do no wrong”, by refusing to give any reasons for the doing
of what he considers a “Constitutional prerogotive”: as a free Citizen
I have equal rights under that instrument, and construe his powers
as extending only to the dismissal of unfaithful officers during the
period for which they were appointed, inasmuch as Offices were
created for the benefit of the people and when faithfully filled, the
grand object of their creation is attained.—Let the people judge—
If I had been unfaithful, it was due to the Nation to have said so,
and not implied it. If otherwise, I can view his proceedure against
me, in no other light, than the exercise of a high handed power,
governed by no rule of action. When the President vetoed the Bank
bill I gave him in a short letter my grateful acknowledgement but I
uttered no flattery, for I would not flatter Neptune for his Trident.
As the opinions of your predecessors and the records of my Country
proclaim in language that cannot be mistaken that I have heretofore
been considered worthy: it becomes me to say that I have not lived
to see my head whitened by the frosts of fifty five winters, that I
have not bared my bosom to the “pelting of the pittiless storm,” to
cold, heat, wet and dry and often perilled my life in defence of these
liberties gained by my forefathers and their compatriots in arms,
to become a by word of the present day—If the association of my name
in the successful defence and military operations at the second siege
of Camp Meigs and the battle of the Thames in 1813, at Pensacola
and New Orleans in 1814 & 15, in the Seminole War of 1818. or as
Commissioner in 1821 for the reception (at S" Augustine) of East
Florida from the Spanish authorities, as if to have been brevetted
backwards through ignorance for “Gallant conduct and general
good behaviour” for my services at New Orleans. If to have been
reduced from the grade of Colo. of the 4" Infantry to that of Lieu"

favoriteism) and resisted it by resignation, If to have been faithful

of Florida, If to have pertinaciously guarded the interests of my
Country against frauds and speculation, If to have satisfactorily
refuted every attempt to impugn my official conduct heretofore as
the records of the General Land Office plainly evince, If to have
been ever at my post to perform the duties of my Official Station
(Save when the hand of God lay heavy on me), If not being a De-
faulter to my Government but she in default to me, If all or any of
these deserve the odium of dismissal from Office; then am I proud

Petition
We the undersigned Citizens of Walton County West Florida,
resident on Yellow River, do Humbly and Respectfully Petition the
Hon David Levy, Delegate in Congress from Florida, To cause to be
appropriated for the improvement of Navigtion in Yellow River
the Sum of Fifteen Thousand dollars. As this River has never been
yet Cleared of its obstructions, which are Rafts, Logs &c whilst
other rivers not more important to the farmer have been appropriated
for, and now enjoy the benefits of easy Navigation, which we are
denied. The Natural Stream of Yellow River is a deep good River
susceptible of Steam & Keel Boat Navigation at least 140 miles from
its mouth, passing through a rich fertile country, well timbered with
Live Oak, and all other kinds peculiar to the Climate of the largest
size. Lands on the River remain uncleared and unsettled, only
because they are so far from a suitable Market, whereas if the river
was rendered navigable every acre would be soon settled upon, thereby
throwing into the National Treasury great sums, which will otherwise
be lost for many years, perhaps centuries.

JACKSONVILLE June 10th 1842.
SIR Since my communication of the 26th. ulto.” to the Depmt.
I have been to St. Augustine and procured all the confirmed Spanish
land-grants up to 1828, I shall soon have the remainder up to this
date, likewise several Township plats; I perceive by them that very
few of them are designated on the plats but are principally run into
public Lands, & the claimants of those large Mill-grants it appears
are claiming four times as much as their grants calls for, and are lo-
cating them wherever they can find valuable timber, & there is no
other alternative to resort to but to employ a surveyor and ascertain
the location of their grants according to the list I got from the Office
of the Archives, & by this method there can be saved hundred of
thousands of dollars worth of valuable timber, & it will result in this,
when they find I know the public from the private Lands they will
readily go forward & buy the said Lands & pay for them.
In the short period I have been here I have been informed by Col.
Cole that there has been a number of Applicants to enter Land, and
he informed me that they appear to be convinced that I calculate
to prosecute every man that trespasses on the public Lands, those
men are prevented from entering and paying for those Lands on
account of the Registers not being confirmed.
I have employed a County Surveyor at the per-diem of the pay
& emoluments of a Lieutenant of Engineers, he is to commence upon
his duties when he returns from Surveying a grant near Lake munroe
where he went with Mr Douglass & Fernandez, there is no doubt
but what he can render valuable services to the Government, as he
has lived in the Country & done much Government Surveying.
Permit me to call your attention to horse-hire, I find the country
in such a state of affairs, from the privilege which the people have
taken in Cutting timber & Saw-logs from public Lands (& I pre-
sume not being very closely looked after) I shall be under the ne-
cessity of being very diligent, it will be necessary for me to be operating
by land or by water every day this Summer, & probably all fall &
winter, to put a thorough check to those Mill & Lumber operators-
In this case I shall stand in need of one or two horses, & two or
three mules for packing & it is impossible to get a horse & have him

found short of two dollars a day, & in my opinion it would be a very
great saving if I should be permitted to buy at the Government sale
at Palatka on the 27th. of this month on account of the Depmt.
such horses & mules that I might stand in need of that would not
cost one half the amount that it would to hire, another great advan-
tage to derive from it, is that I could always have my horses any
moment that I should want, but if I depend upon hiring, the very
moment that I should want them more than probable it would be
impossible to get them.
I have hired a small sloop for one month of about 15 tons burthen
& a crew I find that laboring men can not live upon a ration in
this Country, I find that it requires a full ration & a half. As I
can draw no rations from the Commissary & have no money in my
hands for expenditures I have to buy provisions on Credit, & at an
enormous price at this place, if the Depmt. should confine me down
to the price of a ration & a half & should be considerable the looser,
but I do not mention this that I am apprehensive that all that is
just & right will not be allowed, neither should I hesitate or stop my
movements if I knew positively that it would cost me one half more
than what I would be allowed by the Depmt. for I am determined
if men want Lumber to speculate on they shall buy the Land in ad-
Vance,
I have not heard from the Depmt. since my arrival here, please to
inform me in regard to the horses before the day of sale, or give di-
rections to that effect”—

COLONEL W. J. WORTH, Commanding the Army in Florida.
SIR, Although it is very well known to this Department that you
have evinced extraordinary zeal, judgment and activity in defending
the inhabitants of Florida and Georgia from the inroads and depreda-
tions of the hostile Indians, and that you need no incitement to con-
tinued diligence and watchfulness in the promotion of that object,
yet as great apprehensions are entertained that the severity of your
pressure on the Indians in Florida will cause them to endeavor to escape
into Georgia, I am urged to call your attention to the point. My
conviction of its being wholly unnecessary, causes some reluctance in
complying with these solicitations. But as it can do no harm, and
as you will appreciate the motive, I would desire you to give your
particular attention to the passes by which the Indians may elude
your scouts and escape into Georgia. These passes are described in
a printed letter of General Knight, contained in a document of the
House of Representatives herewith transmitted to you. I would
take extraordinary pains to obviate even a seeming, although not real,
cause of complaint on the part of the people or public authorities of

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF LEON
COUNTY
[NA:SF, 27 Cong., 2 sess.:DS*]
[July 1, 1842]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled:
The Memorial of the undersigned, citizens of the United States,
inhabitants of the County of Leon in the Territory of Florida re-
spectfully sheweth:
That notwithstanding the solemn pledge of the nation made to

Recd., W 235, printed in H. Exec. Docs. 262, 27 Cong., 2 sess., p. 37), reporting
the murder of eight white persons on the forks of the Santa Fe River by a detach-
ment of eight or ten Indians, who escaped from the military force stationed in the
vicinity. See also the President to the Secretary of War, May 31 (?) 1842 (NA,
WD, SW Reg. of Lets. Recd., P 321), referring a presentment of the grand jury of
Madison Co. (not seen), regarding the evils of the Indian War and requesting that
the militia be called out and a bounty of land offered them at the close of the War.
See post, p. 515.
* Cf. post, p. 560.
* The body of this memorial is in printed form with the name of the county
written in. Identical memorials were also submitted by Delegate Levy to the
House of Representatives, Dec. 27, 1842, and referred to the Committee on the
Territories (House Journal, 27 Cong., 3 sess., p. 100). With the exception of the
one from Leon County, printed above, all of the petitions presented by Levy
are in NA (HF, 27 Cong., 3 sess.). The text of the present memorial is also
printed in Dodd (ed.) Fla. Becomes a State, pp. 401–404, but without names of
the subscribers.

Spain, and to the inhabitants of Florida in the 6th article of the
Treaty of Cession *; and although in 1837 the People of Florida, by
popular vote, decided to become a State *; and although upwards
of three years ago, they formed, adopted, and ratified a republican
Constitution or form of government for themselves as the State of
Florida; and although the Convention of the People preferred their
respectful memorial to Congress for admission into the Union as a
State"; and although that memorial has been followed up by respectful
petitions of the inhabitants of the Territory, and of the Territorial
Legislature in behalf of their constituents at each session of Congress
since; yet these several and repeated applications have not been
granted, and on the contrary have, as your memorialists humbly
conceive, been treated with neglect and indifference, undeserved
by the People of Florida, and which they were not justified as American
citizens in anticipating, when they preferred them.
The undersigned respectfully renew said applications, and ask
of the Federal Government to take action on this subject at the
present session of Congress, by the admission of Florida into the
Union as a State, under the Constitution formed and adopted at
St. Joseph, January 11th, 1839, and ratified by a popular vote of
the people. This course is desired by a very large majority of the people
of Florida. When the Constitution was submitted to the people in
May, 1839, for ratification, little time had been afforded to examine
and discuss its merits, and hence many voted against it, and amongst
them several of the undersigned, who now, after reflection, approve
of its provisions, and are decidedly in favor of the immediate organi-
zation of the State Government, and admission into the Union under
it. A project has been started for the Division of Florida into two
Territories,” before the State Government is established, the East
and South to compose one, and the Middle and West the other.—
Against this scheme we respectfully beg leave to enter our solemn
protest. The East and South have joined in the formation of the
Constitution—they should carry out the work and aid in the establish-
ment of the State Government under it, instead of throwing it away
and thus obliging the Middle and West to encounter the expense
and incur the delay incident to the formation of another Constitution.
Besides but a small portion of even the East favors this project.
But we most cheerfully express our acquiescence in the insertion of
a provision in the act of admission, that the inhabitants of the East
and South shall, after the organization and establishment of the

State, become a separate Territory or State as soon as practicable,
and we would desire for their security that the pledge should be made
in as strong and explicit language as can be used.
The undersigned would respectfully urge upon Congress the justice
and the policy of making, in the act admitting Florida a State, a
liberal donation of the public lands within her boundaries, to enable
her to get the State Government into operation efficiently, bene-
ficially and successfully. Florida has been deeply injured, nay well
nigh ruined, by the deplorable war which has raged here for six years
past. Without reference to the immense individual losses by the
destruction of property, and without looking to the sufferings sus-
tained by thousands of her citizens being made houseless and home-
less, and by having their families and friends barbarously murdered
by the savage foe, as a community we have likewise been deeply
injured. Millions of dollars would not repair the losses sustained by
the people in the aggregate, without including individual cases as
above mentioned.
These things are manifest to all who can compare our present
condition with that before the war. Our most fertile fields, then in
profitable cultivation, are now lying waste, with nearly every house
and cabin, on a frontier of upwards of four hundred miles, burned
to the ground, and hundreds of the best plantations deserted by their
former possessors and grown up in bushes. Florida has been put
back ten years by this war. Thousands who hold property in Florida
have been deterred from removing hither, and many peaceful citizens
have sought a less disturbed and dangerous residence elsewhere.
Her energies have been crippled, her resources are reduced, and
all those means by which a people advance to prosperity and happiness
have been diminished and weakened.
Surely when it is considered that this war was not commenced
through the fault of the people of Florida, these facts should commend
them to the nation as being entitled to its generous and liberal aid.
Such aid would encourage emigration, and to afford it would be a
policy, wise in itself, and worthy the Federal Government. With
such aid the State of Florida would be rendered fully competent for
her own protection and defence. Florida will be a frontier State,
distant from the seat of Government. From her geographical posi-
tion, and her extensive seaboard, in time of war, she will be an exposed
point of attack, and should be prepared to meet an invading enemy.
She should have arms, but arms are useless without men to bear them,
and to supply and sustain men she must have means. The State of
Florida should be encouraged; her speedy settlement should be pro-
moted; she should be afforded aid in the outset of her career, and the
appeal is now made because such assistance will be of greater value

than at any time hereafter. Nor can it be supposed that this appe.
of her people will be made in vain. Surely something is due to
people who, while all the rest of the citizens of the United States hav
been enjoying the inestimable blessings of peace, have been expose
for six long years to the devastations of a murderous, savage, an
relentless warfare, and deprived of those advantages which have beel
common to all the rest of their fellow citizens.
The undersigned, however, forbear making further suggestions upol
matters which they are satisfied will be manifest to the wisdom o
Congress, and they respectfully ask a decision upon their application
at this session.
And as in duty bound your memorialists will ever pray, &c.

[NA:ND, SN Lets. to Cong., Bk. 8]
NAVY DEPARTMENT July 7* 1842
HON W* P. ARCHER Ch" Nav. Com. Senate
SIR, In my annual report I called the attention of Congress to
the propriety of extending additional protection to the Live Oak
timber belonging to the U. States.
Since that time, I have had occasion to communicate to the Naval
Committee of the Senate, copies of letters received at this Depart-
ment, showing the great extent of the depredations daily committed,
on this valuable portion of the public property.—In a letter which
I had the honor to address to the Hon. Mr Graham, of the 21* of Feb”
last,” I ventured to suggest the proper expedient for preventing these
depredations. To these several Communications, I respectfully ask
your attention. There are now employed, two Agents, one in East
Florida and one in Louisiana. Another is required for the West
Coast of Florida. I have not seen the bill making appropriations
for the Navy, since it passed the Senate, but I am informed that it
contains no appropriation for this object. It appears to me to be
altogether too important to be overlooked. May I solicit your
attention to it, and that you will see that the necessary appropriation
be made. With the aid of small vessels of the Navy, as contem-
plated in the bill now before the Senate, or its Naval Committee I
do not doubt that ample protection can be extended along our whole
coast, for fifteen or twenty thousand dollars per annum. The value
of the timber annually destroyed for want of such protection, is
many times as great
I am with great respect Sir, Your Ob" Serv"

HEZEKIAH L. THISTLE TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd. Misc., Unentered:LS]
JACKSONVILLE July 8th, 1842.
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
SIR. As I am well aware of your intentions to do every thing
for the welfare of your Country, & as your well known character
insure me your willingness to receive information from any source
although it may be tendered by one in the most humble Station, I
take the liberty to address you this communication in regard to the
timber for which I have been appointed the Agent, & my views
upon subjects connected with the Florida war.
I first beg leave to take up the subject of the bill which is now
before Congress for the armed occupancy & Settlement of Florida.”
I am not fully conversant with the provisions of the bill, but from
what information I can gather, I think it similar to the Bill proposed
by Mr Benton of the Senate for the same purpose,” although it does
not give so large a tract of Land to the Settler; The Bill now pending
gives 160 acres of land to the Settler & he cannot have a title to the
Land for 5 years.
My views are that this armed occupation & settlement of Florida
can never clear the Indians from the Country, to be sure it has been
argued in Congress that the far West was settled by the Pioneers
of the Country, which fact I will admit, but I will show the difference
in the Countries, we will take for instance Kentucky & Ohio, other
States I might name which are not important to illustrate the dif-
ference of the two sections of the Country. Those two named States
are well known as a garden-spot, every farm house is in call of another.
To look at the map you will perceive that Florida is made up of Lakes,
Morasses, & hammocks; I believe it is given up by those who are
well acquainted with Florida south of Latitude 28 or 9. that there
is not one square mile out of 20 that is calculated for a poor man to
become a Settler upon, & on that ground the pioneers can not have
the advantages that they had in the Western States.
Those far west located their Settlements, the same as you would
go into a harvest field, & commenced cutting, clearing & cultivating,
the land being inch and fertile the Settlers could all be in call of one
another, with good water & a healthy climate the men kept hearty
strong & robust to endure any fatigue which might be necessary;
* This bill became law on its approval by the President, Aug. 4, 1842 (5 STAT.
502-504). An act amending the law in question was approved June 15, 1844
(ibid., pp. 671-672).

the savage had no grass-lakes, swamps, extensive hammocks, or land
unfit for cultivation to secrete themselves in, & in Florida they hav
all those above names places, the Climate is unhealthy, the inhabitant
will continually be affected with the chill & fever, & attacks of the
Bilious fever, and if they plant & raise a crop the Indians will skulk
from their hiding places & harvest the same for them, this is one
reason which I set forth showing that the armed occupation & settle.
ment of Florida will not have a good effect.
2dly. I persist that if Florida is ever Settled, the Southern part
of it must be settled by wealthy men, where their planting can be
carried on by Negroes, whilst the whites make good their retreat to
some healthy situation of the Sea-board in the sickly season,
Wealthy men will not settle it, for it is well known that those who
had extensive plantations & a large number of Slaves have abandoned
their places and could not be persuaded to return, although they
had U S troops as protection to the frontiers, & can it be supposed
as long as hostile Indians remain in the Country that they would go
farther South in the wilds of Florida & remain there 5 years for the
sake of 160 acres of Land.
To be sure if Govmt will give them the choice of location, to cut
& use the timber at their pleasure, there will be a great number of
men who will come into Florida who will call themselves Settlers &
it would simply result in this men would form themselves into com-
panies & locate all the valuable live oak & cedar Timber Land (I
speak from the knowledge that men have enquired of me where the
best live oak timber land could be found) & they would cut, sell &
carry away, & in the space of 5 years there would not be a stick of
Live-oak or cedar fit to put into a Sloop-of war upon the whole Pen-
insula of Florida.
Furthermore, the Indians will still be lurking in the Country &
multiplying & thriving, & as usual, constantly murdering & depre-
dating whenever it suited their convenience.—The question may be
asked, where this large quantity of timber will be carried? I will
answer it would be carried to Europe, & sunk in docks where it will
improve, whilst we will be crying out, “what a pity we have lost all
of our valuable timber.”
It is the well know policy of Great Britain to “prepare for war in
time of peace—I will now state my views upon the subject.-In my
letter to the Secretary of the Navy of the 23rd–May last" in con-
nection with my business as the agent for the protection of timber,
I highly recommended a survey of Florida, & as the power is vested

## p. 507 (#519) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 507
in you to order a Survey whenever you think proper, I will now
draw your attention to the subject—
1st. If the unsurveyed part of Florida should be surveyed, one
of the great advantages would result in this, all of the valuable tim-
ber for Naval purposes could be reserved, & could be designated in
such a manner that any agent or individual could know it from other
lands, there could then, be no excuse for trespassing—
As the surveyed part of Florida now stands, I find that old Span-
ish claims of an indisputable nature (as well as some English trans-
fered under Spanish Authority) are run out into Public Lands.—
In making my surveys, in order to convince myself whether persons
are tresspassing or not, I find that Govm’t have actually made dona-
tions covering private claims, & likewise land has been entered &
payed for as public Lands at the land Office, where it was private
property—The cause of this is the neglect of individuals producing
their papers & claims, or the neglect of the Surveyors in not running
out such private claims; This however cannot hapen again when-
ever you see fit to cause the unsurveyed part of Florida to be sur-
veyed, as I have taken the precaution to get into my possession all
the Old Spanish Grants which have been confirmed by the Commis-
sioners or the Courts, & likewise those which are now pending.
In my letter to the Secretary of the Navy of the 23rd of May "I
recommended a re-survey of that part of Florida which has been
surveyed on account of the above named difficulties, & the great
difficulty to designate the Range, Township, & Section Comes, on
account of the Corner marks in many instances having been put on
small saplings which have rotted down, or been destroyed by fire, -
2dly—Another advantage would result from this survey.—When
the Country should be surveyed & cut up into Ranges, Townships,
Sections & Quarter Sections, if there were any Indian Towns, or
places cultivated we would be sure to find them, & it is well known
that nothing disturbs an Indian as much as a Survey of their Country.
This survey could be made with all safety with a force of 150 or 200
men, which would be sufficient to protect & guard 3 or 4 Surveying
parties.
I will further give my views upon the plan to exterminate the
Indians from Florida, that is, say a bounty upon each Indian's head;
this measure might probably be considered unpopular to the north,
but to do away with this prejudice, we will say let Congress give a
bounty of $500. for each Indian or Indian-negro taken prisoner &
nothing for those accidentally killed, & likewise 320 acres of good
tillable land when the Indians shall be cleared from Florida, & if

Congress should pass such a law & limit the number of men to be en-
gaged & furnish them with arms rations & amunition for one year, I
am of the opinion that in Six or eight months there would not be an
Indian left in Florida.
I do not set forth this measure to be a popular one, but I consider
it much more charatable than the one Congress has now under con-
sideration, for that is nothing more or less than a bounty on an In-
dian's head—The setlers have no inducement to save an Indian's life
or take a prisoner, they would shoot them down as the wolves in the
forrest, & then let them lay, if they had an Opportunity."
My last arises upon this subject may not probably be considered
worthy of notice, but I presume you will agree with me in my views
upon the surveying of Florida, I am here, & am constantly engaged
in the performance of my duty, & am ready to act in any capacity
which may result in benefit to the Country—I have been principally
operating in the Forrest in the vicinity of this place. To be sure I
have not been in the interior in the Indian Country, the reason
that I have not operated further South is, that I have not had money
or means, & Col. Worth (as I have been informed) was negociating
with the Indians & considered the war at an end. There may not
at this present time be more than 30 Indian warriors in the Country,
but I am of opinion that our Indian friends have been always under-
rated & am still of the same opinion.”

your influence much may be effected in correcting the abuses of the
Revenue Laws, which have for years existed in this Territory, whereby
much good will result to our Citizens; We have deemed it proper
to make the following statement to you: Wiz., Previous to the
Indian War, the Collectors at Key West permitted the subjects
of Spain to make settlements, and carry on fisheries on the Coast
of Southern Florida, where Indians were employed not only as fisher-
men at the Rancho's, but as Sailors to navigate those spanish vessels,
among which were Antonio Nikeka (hanged by Col Harney) names
no doubt familiar to you. Those vessels were in the habit of smug-
gling foreign goods on the Coast and frequently lay for months at .
Charlotte Harbour and other places with empunity, altho no such
right was granted to them by the treaty of Cession; and vessels
of the United States were prohibited under the severest penalties
to catch fish or Turtle on the Spanish Coast. Many of those Spani-
ards acquired very great influence over the Indians, and exercised
very great authority over them by forming connections with their
women, and there is no doubt that they encouraged them to go
to War with the whites if their removal to the West was insisted
upon, and furnished them with amunition when the war commenced.
It is a fact not generally known that one Juan Badia in Havana
was largely interested in those fisheries who never saw them. Those
Spanish vessels frequently carried Indians in considerable numbers
over to Cuba where they received presents &c Contrary to an express
Law of the United States. It is well known to the revenue officers
in South Florida that a class of vessels called Smacks, which catch
fish on the coast of Florida, and carry them alive to Havana, do
sail under two sets of papers & colors, Viz an American register
and a Spanish coasting license. These vessels never hoist the Ameri-
can flag in Havana, nor do they ever present their American papers in
the Spanish Custom house; but they hoist the Spanish Coasting
flag and show their Spanish License, and every man on board has
a Spanish name. When they Come to Key West they are Americans
of course. This is an evil which should be corrected by the proper
authority. Vessels both American and English are in the Constant
habit of Carrying British free negroes to and from Key West, and
the other Keys along the Florida reef to the Bahama Islands Contrary
to the Laws of Florida and of the United States, and British vessels
have been known to visit our Coast without being boarded by any
Revenue officer. The situation of Florida at all times is a peculiar one,
and more particularly so at present, and no foreign vessel should be
permitted to come into our waters without the strictest search, as it is
much to be feared that they will afford facilities to the Indians by
selling them powder and lead, and to our slaves opportunities of escape

to the British Islands. If (as we have heard) the Spaniards again
return to their Rancho's and are permitted to occupy and carry on
fisheries as they did previous to the War, they will again acquire
all their former influence over the Indians remaining in Florida, and
which must result in constant difficulties with the settlers on the
Coast, and scenes of bloodshed and murder will be as common as
they were previous to the War. And if also the free negroes of the
British Islands are permitted to come and go at pleasure as heretofore,
the slave population a Florida particularly the Southern part will have
every inducement held out to them to run away from their owners.
The practice pursued at Key West of making Citizens of foreigners
particularly Spaniards when the are wanted to command an American
vessel is as follows. A Spanish fisherman wishing to command an
American vessel or vote at an election go with another Spaniard to
a Justice of the Peace, where the one Swears the other was in Florida
at the Cession of Florida, or as it is called “the change of flags;” this
affidavit is carried to the Collector at Key West who gives him a pro-
tection or puts him on the vessels papers as Captain and he is ever
afterwards recognized as an american altho he speaks no English
We believe Sir that through your representations and influence
such procedings will be put a stop to, and that much good will be
the result, and thereby protection will be given to the Citizens of
our Country forming new settlements on the Coast.

At an election held at Piles' Mill on Trout Creek in Duval County
on the Eleventh day of July 1842 for Field officers of the Eleventh
Regiment of Florida militia composed of the counties of Duval and
Nassau—after the Polls' were closed a meeting of the people was
called to take into consideration the subject of State Government,
recently agitated at several meetings in Middle Florida.
Mr Elijah Higginbotham was called to the chair and Ossian B.
Hart Esqr appointed Secretary—and the object of the meeting having
been explained-Messrs J. D. Hart, J. B. Lancaster, M:Curry-J Piles
and J. McRory—were appointed a committee to report Resolutions

expressive of the sense of the meeting upon this subject, who thereafter
reported the following to wit:
Resolved that the Indian Depredations which have now continued
more than six years, has greatly decreased the permanent population
of East Florida-numbers having died from exposure and suffering,
and large numbers from Savage barbarity, and the perils of battle,
while the means of subsistence of the whole population have been
greatly diminished by Indian plundering and deprivations, and by
the difficulty of making and securing crops—and that under such
circumstances, taxes to support State Government, would be ruinous,
impolitic, and highly oppressive—
Resolved—That having once assumed State Government, we can
never recede. but must continue ever after, to maintain that form of
Government, be the taxes ever so burthensome and ruinous And that
the offer made in Middle Florida of permitting East Florida to re-
assume the form of Territorial Government after we shall have bound
ourselves to her to make her application the more binding imposing,
is a shallow artifice for which there is no warrant in the constitution
or Treaty, and we will not permit ourselves to be Gulled by it—
Resolved—As the Floridas were added by Spain to the United
States, as seperate provinces we hold East Florida under that Treaty
of Session to have seperate rights, and that her right to seperate
and independant State Government is inalienable and can only be
wrested from her by violence and oppression, the arguments of
despotism—
Resolved—If Middle and West Florida wish admission into the
Union as a seperate State, leaving East Florida to remain a Territory
untill her own resources shall warrant her applying for admission we
will throw no obsticles in their way—
Resolved—That we regard with scorn and contempt the impotent
menace held out in some of the Middle Florida Prints, that if they
cannot bring us to their measures by the wise and mild arguments of
“grass and clods” they “will try the virtue of stones” we do not desire
any collision with them—we believe many of their best and most
prudent Citizens—entertain no such sentiments—But should it come
to that—Knowing our rights, feeling the Justice of our cause, relying
also on the Protection of Providence and our own good right arm—
we say “let come what will come”
Resolved—That we are opposed to Banks and to faith bonds for
Banks—to State Government and taxes at present—That we are
resolved to maintain the political and legal rights of East Florida:
That her rights by the Treaty are separate from those of the Middle
and West, and of course we claim a division of the Territory, and
Separate Territorial Government—That we will support no person

sketch of the country” in which they are permitted to hunt and plant.
On the Gulf side there are natural & insurmountable obstacles to any
settlement or occupancy by the whites south of Pease Creek. You
will perceive that they are excluded from the Islands on the south and
the entire coast (where our vessels are usually wrecked) on the east
side.
I entertain no doubt of their sincerity, or that they will gladly
conform to the terms of the indulgence accorded; but I have required
the chiefs themselves to meet me at Fort Brooke on the 5" proximo,
to give a pledge for the behaviour of their followers.

These messengers say that a large portion have secretly expressed
a wish to come in in the Autumn to join their kindred in the West—a
proposition which none dare make openly, as, by their laws such
would be instant death.”
In respect to the few Creeks yet in Middle Florida, affairs are not
so satisfactory. My messenger returned, for the third time, to day:
he states that thirty-six of the Warriors remain West of the Suwannee
headed by the Chief Octiarti, who, with about half the number are
disposed to peace and to go to the lands assigned them, some to emi-
grate: the other half, who cannot be made to believe that they will be
pardoned, are for prosecuting the war. Sixteen, he says, have passed
South of Suwannee determined on no further molestation of the whites.
I have now thirteen companies broken into small detachments &
disposed so as to give the utmost practicable protection to the settle-
ments in Middle Florida. After perfecting the arrangement with
those south, I shall withdraw the garrison (two companies) from Fort
Pierce"—the post is inconvenient of approach & supply: covering no
settlement or frontier, and only useful as a depot in respect to
operations South, which of course are no longer in contemplation; be-
sides it will be regarded as evidence of sincerity by the Indians, and
make it necessary, as I desire it should be, for them to resort to Tampa
to trade
There is no longer occasion for the presence of the six companies of
the 4* Infantry within this Department, and I shall be pleased to
receive their route before leaving for the North, which I propose to
do early after the 5" proximo.”

Minutes of a talk held at F* Brooke. Fl” July 21, 1842 by Colo
Worth with Fosse Hadjo, an indian of some distinction belonging to
the Southern band.
Fosse Hadjo stated that he was sent in by Billy Bowlegs in con-
sequence of a talk received from the Colonel by the old indian, & to
say that the talk had made him glad & that the Seminoles and Mick-
asukies would all be glad to hear it:—that Bowlegs had gone to give
the talk to such of his people as he could find, & that when he as-
sembles them, which he expects to do soon, he hopes to have a talk
himself, with the Colonel. He does not wish the Creeks to live with
them; they cannot agree & should they occupy the same country
there will be frequent difficulties amongst them owing to their bad
conduct towards the whites. Sam Jones is the principal chief of the
Southern Indians, but he has only ten warriors with him;” he does not
know where Jones now is but he hopes soon to find him. Fosse
Hadjo stated that Bowlegs had sent him with this talk, & to ascertain
from the Colonel if the talk brought by the old Indian is a true talk.
Col° Worth stated to Fosse Hadjo that he had but a short talk to
make. He had received word from the Great Father in Washington
that there must be no more fighting between his white & red children
& that no more blood must be shed between them, but that they
must be friends & shake hands together, that although he lives a
great distance from them he sees the bleached bones of those who
have been killed & it makes his heart sad. That the Great Father
who sends this word is not the same they had some time since but
has been recently chosen by his white children. He is willing his
red children should remain in Florida or go to Arkansas as they may
prefer; but as their friend and father he advises them not to remain
here, but to join their red brethern in the West because many of

their relations, some their fathers & mothers, some their children,
& others their brothers or sisters, have gone there, & those that
remain are few in numbers, & the whites are fast settling the country, -
the red men are decreasing in numbers while the whites are increas-
ing—they will be surrounded by a large number of them in a short
time, and as there are some bad men amongst the whites, as there
are also some bad Indians, they may have trouble. It would be
better therefore that they should be seperated a great distance from
each other, but they could choose for themselves. Should they go
to the West they will receive money and a rifle for each warrior, also
rations for one year—Should they remain they will receive nothing:
but only be permitted to occupy a piece of land, which they are
distinctly to understand they are not to leave except to visit Tampa
to trade where a trading house will be established for them. The
country they are to occupy is the same that was set apart for them by
Gen' Macomb in his arrangement with Chittey Tustenugge in 1839.
As some of our vessels may be wrecked on the coast, they are to
promise to take care of & treat with kindness all persons they may
find on the coast, and bring them in to the whites from whom they
will receive pay for their services either in goods or money. This
must be particularly attended to as any outrages committed on these
unfortunate persons will be severely punished. They must see that
any depredations which may be committed by their people on the
whites are punished by the Indian law; & any that may be committed
by the whites on their people in like manner be punished by the law
of the whites. As their numbers were now so few the Great Father
was quite indifferent whether they remained in the country or went
to the West, but if any should hereafter wish to emigrate they would
be sent to Arkansas at any time their numbers would amount to
forty or fifty.
The Colonel further stated to Fosse Hadjo that he wished to have
a talk as early as possible with Bowlegs & the rest of his people,
who are authorised to transact business for the whole of them, &
Fosse Hadjo promised to return in 17 days & have the talk required.
He did not know if Sam Jones could be found in time for the talk,
but would endeavour to have him & the Prophet both present. He
also promised to bring with him some runners to carry a talk to the
Creeks. When shown the Map of the portion of country to be
allotted to them, embraced in red lines, he said he had a field just
outside of that line & asked if the line could not be extended so as to
take in the field. He was told this could not be done, but that he

might this year gather the crop he had planted, but the next year
he must plant within the line, with which he appeared quite satisfied.
He left here on the 22" with the talk to Bowlegs, to return with that
chief & others in 17 days & requested that on the thirteenth day
Passacca & Interpreter Toney might come out to meet them on
their way in.

TREASURY DEPARTMENT 5” Auditor's Office,

SIR, As it is probable an appropriation will be made during the
present Session, with which to rebuild the Lighthouse at Mosquito
Inlet, recently called New Smyrna, in Florida, it is proper that the
site, which is represented to belong to the U. States, should be re-
served from sale, & set apart for the use of the Lighthouse.
The Lighthouse heretofore build, & demolished by the sea, was
located on the south side of the entrance into Mosquito Inlet. It
has been recommended that the location be changed to the North
Side of the entrance into Mosquito Inlet; & as the land on both sides
of the entrance into the Inlet, is stated to belong to the United States,
it is desirable that from five to ten acres of land be reserved at each
place, so as to allow us an option in building the Lighthouse on one
side or the other as may be thought best.
I send you a rough sketch of the entrance into the Inlet in question,
with a request that if the land on both sides should have been sur-
veyed, & if not—when it shall be, you will be pleased to reserve it
7"b The instructions were sent to Conway, July 30, 1842 (NA, GLO, Lets. to

SIR. I have now to report the thorough pacification of this ter-
ritory. Holaeta Emathlachee (Bowlegs) accompanied by two noted
sub-chiefs, representing the Southern Indians, met me at Tampa on
the 5" ins" and in their behalf gladly accepted the concession reported
in my dispatch of the 24" ulto.” Coming with me to this place they
proceeded in search of the Creeks, and returned on the 10" with
Octiarti,” Tiger-Tail and others representing those people. The
former are to pass within the designated limits immediately; the lat-
ter as soon as they can be collected. Some have already crossed the
Suwannee, and the whole will have done so in ten or twelve days.
Many have already signified a wish to be sent to their friends in
the West, Tiger-Tail particularly is urgent to go immediately: but
I have represented the importance to himself to take a respectable
band with him.
Orders will issue immediately to concentrate the 3" Infantry upon
Fort Stansbury" (the depot in that quarter) and Cantonment Mor-
gan,” five companies at each; the 8" except the garrison of Fort King,
upon Palatka. The 4" is already in position of one, two, and three
day's march from the point of embarkation, when such shall be
directed.*
The posts generally being supplied with subsistence for a month,
the movement of the first and last Corps will be gradual and not
completed 'till the last Indian shall have crossed the Suwannee.
I shall proceed to Palatka on the 15", at that place surrender the
command to Col” Wose, and then be governed by the instructions of
the General in Chief of the 11" of May.”

the “Mounatee river, thirty five miles South of Fort Brook in the

The writer States that he is engaged in “making large openings of
land with the view of cultivation, on which large quantities of live
oak timber Stands, and having to deaden or otherwise destroy said
timber” he makes the enquiry whether he has not the right to use
such timber, accompanied by the remark that “without this right,
valuable timber will be lost producing no good either to the Settler or
govenment.”
He also proposes to contract with the Department for the timber
cut down, (it is presumed he means,) in the preparation of settle-

that no person who shall be a resident of Florida at the time of the
passage of this act, who shall be the owner of one hundred and sixty
acres of land at the time he proposes to settle, shall be entitled to
a permit from the Register.”
As our immediate action in the execution of this law is confined
to the foregoing provisions contained in its first section, the present
directions are restricted to the provisions of that section alone,
leaving the other portions of the act, which are of prospective effect,
(requiring certain future acts and proceedings on the part of the
settler,) to be subjects of future instructions.
Your first duty, in executing the law, will be to require from the
settler who applies for its benefits, a NOTICE, in writing, according
to the following form, blanks for which are herewith furnished.
Under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved on the 4th
day of August, A. D. 1842, entitled “An act to provide for the
armed occupation and settlement of the unsettled part of the
peninsula of East Florida”—
To all whom it may concern:
Notice is hereby given, that under the provisions of the act of
Congress above cited, I, A. B., do hereby apply to the Register
of the proper Land Office for a PERMIT to settle upon one hundred
and sixty acres of unappropriated public land, lying south of the
line dividing townships numbered nine and ten, south of the base
line, and situated as herein described.
I aver that I am, (note 1 shows how this blank is to be filled,) and
that I became a resident of Florida in the month of [Blank], of the
year [Blank]. (See note 2.)
I aver that the settlement herein intended is not “within two
miles of any permanent military post of the United States, estab-
lished and garrisoned” at the time of such settlement, and that
the same is not known or believed to interfere with any private
claim that has been duly filed with any of the Boards of Commission-
ers, surveyed or unsurveyed, confirmed or unconfirmed. (See
note 3.)
Given under my hand, this [Blank] day of [Blank], A. D. 184
[Blank].
TO THE REGISTER OF THE LAND OFFICE, At [Blank], East Florida.
Note 1.—This blank must be filled up in the words of the law,
according to the circumstances of the case, thus:—
“The head of a family,” or “a single man over eighteen years
of age, able to bear arms.”

Note 2.—As the first condition of the first section of the law pro-
vides, “that no person who shall be a resident of Florida at the time
of the passage of this act, who shall be the owner of one hundred
and sixty acres of land at the time he proposes to settle, shall be
entitled to a PERMIT from the Register,” it follows, that if the date
with which this blank is filled, shall be on the 4th day of August,
1842, (the day when the act was approved,) the settler must accom-
pany his “Notice” with some evidence, that he is not the owner
of one hundred and sixty acres of land; and that evidence will have
to be his own affidavit after the following, or any other equivalent
form.
FORM OF AFFIDAVIT.
I, A. B., being a settler in Florida, on the 4th August, 1842, and
being about to apply to the proper authority for the benefit of the
act of Congress, approved on the day aforesaid, entitled, “An act
to provide for the armed occupation and settlement of the unsettled
part of the Peninsula of East Florida,” do hereby declare on oath,
that I am not the owner of one hundred and sixty acres of land.

Note 3.—In case the land has been surveyed, [here insert its
proper description, as the (Blank) quarter of section number (Blank)

But, in case the land has not been surveyed, the applicant, in
this part of his notice, must describe with as much precision and
clearness as practicable, the locality of the tract which he desires
to settle upon, in reference to some natural object, such as a river, or
its tributary stream, lake, pond, bayou, lagoon, or some other known
and conspicuous object, such as the name of a hammock, prairie,
or sink, of well known locality, or battle ground, or other spot rendered
notable either of late or remote years. If such object, as herein
alluded to, should not be in the immediate vicinity of the tract, it
may nevertheless be useful to state the distance and bearing of the
same, either from the “beginning” point of the settlement, or any
other corner of the same. Such “beginning” point to be well defined,
so as to admit of its being hereafter clearly identified by the surveyors
and shown in connection with the public surveys; thence, (continuing
the description from such “beginning” point, we will say for sake of
example,) running due north, so many chains and links, yards or
feet, according to the mode of measurement employed; thence, due

given distance to be similarly stated; thence, due west, to the place of
“beginning.”
It is highly desirable that such diagram should exhibit the measure-
ments in the most accurate manner, as by due care and precaution
in the outset, much subsequent embarrassment and confusion may
be avoided; and all such diagrams of settler's claims will be afterwards
indicated by dotted lines on the official plat of survey, and prove
most useful and material evidence in the final adjustment of the
boundary lines of claims before the patent can issue. Hence, the
settler may perceive the advantage which will ultimately result to
himself by having the lines of his claim run carefully with chain and
compass as the best mode of insuring accuracy.
The statements made in the Notice are to be sustained by the
affidavit of the party before a Justice of the Peace, and which affidavit
is to be endorsed on the Notice, thus:
“I swear that the statements herein made are true, to the best
of my knowledge and belief.”

On the filing of a notice you are required to examine your records,
and also refer to the office of the keeper of the archives at St. Augustine
to ascertain, if possible, whether any private claim, which may have
been duly filed before any Board of United States Commissioners,
the boundaries of which are distinctly and fully designated, is likely
to be interfered with by the designed settlement; and should you,
in any case, be satisfied that such interference is likely to take place,
there will be valid cause for your refusal to issue a permit for the
land asked for, where the same is found interfered with by a private
claim. If no ground for apprehended interference is found to exist,
you will forthwith issue your permit in the form subjoined.

No. [Blank]
To settle, under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved on
the 4th August, 1842, entitled “An act to provide for the armed
occupation and settlement of the unsettled part of the peninsula
of East Florida.”
Pursuant to the provisions of the act aforesaid, [Blank] is hereby
declared to have permission to make a settlement, in virtue of the
authority of said act, on a tract of public land situate “south of the
line dividing townships numbers nine and ten south,” in the peninsula

of East Florida, and which he describes in the mode set forth in the
accompanying copy of his notice, the original of which has been
placed on file in this office.
The conditions on which this PERMIT is granted, are as follows:
[2d.]* That said settler [Blank] shall reside in the Territory of
Florida, south of the said township line, for five consecutive years,
and to take his grant on any public land south of that township.
[3d.]* That said settler shall erect thereon a house fit for the habi-
tation of man, and shall clear, enclose, and cultivate, at least five
acres of said land, and reside thereon for the space of four years next
following the first year after the date of his PERMIT, if he [or she]
shall so long live.
[4th.]” That such settler shall, within one year after the survey
of said lands, and the opening of the proper office for the entry and
sale of the same by the United States, prove before such tribunal, and
in such manner and form as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, with the approval of the President, the
fact that the settlement has been commenced, and the particular
quarter section upon which it is located; and also that such settler
shall, within six months after the expiration of five years from the date
of his permit, prove, in like manner, the fact of continued residence
and cultivation, as required in the second and third conditions herein
above prescribed; whereupon, and not until then, a patent shall
issue to said settler for such quarter section.
The act declares, “that no right or donation shall be acquired under
this act within two miles of any permanent military post of the
United States, established and garrisoned at the time such settlement
and residence was commenced.”
The act further declares, “that all sales, gifts, devises, agreements,
bonds, or powers to sell, transfers, or liens, whatsoever, private or
judicial, of the lands, or any portion thereof, acquired by this act,
made at any time before patents shall have issued for the same, shall
be utterly void and without effect, to every intent and purpose, wheth-
er in law or equity; and the purchaser or obligee under any such sale,
agreement, bond, or power to sell, transfer, or lien, shall not be en-
titled to recover back the price or consideration paid therefor, but
shall forfeit the same absolutely to such settler or his heirs.”
The act also declares, “that upon the death of any settler before
the end of the five years, or before the issuing of the patent, all his
rights under this act shall descend to his widow, and heirs at law, if
he leaves a widow, and to his heirs at law if he leaves none, to be

vious sale or transfer of the same, or of any interest, legal or equitable,
in the same to the contrary notwithstanding; and proof of his compli-
ance with the conditions of this act, up to the time of his death, shall
be sufficient to entitle them to the patent.”
It is to be distinctly understood that this PERMIT is not designed to
confer any rights, whereby the live oak and red cedar timber abound-
ing on the public lands, shall be interfered with to the detriment of
the United States, for whose use such timber is reserved and protected
by the act of Congress, approved on the 1st March, 1817, entitled
“An act making reservation of certain public lands to supply timber
for naval purposes.”

REGISTER & RECEIVER St Augustine E. Florida
GENTLEMEN, The attention of this office has recently been called to
a list of tracts, reported by you on the 3" July 1840, as “the selections
of school lands made by the School Committee of St Johns County” in
your district.
It appears from this list that the provisions of the Act of 20" May
1826, entitled “an act to appropriate lands for the support of schools,
in certain townships & fractional townships, not before provided for”,”
as well as the printed circular letter of instructions issued with the
view of carrying it into effect, & for securing uniformity in the Reports
of the district land officers, have been entirely misunderstood by you.
Inasmuch as you have in some cases reported the selection of a section
of land for a township having within its limits a full 16" section, & in
1 Not found.

others reported in like manner, an entire section for a township in
which the 16" section is partially covered by private claims.
The laws authorizing the President to survey & offer for sale the
public lands in Florida, directs that the sections & fractional sections
N 16, in every township & fractional township, without regard to their
area or that of the township in which situated, be reserved from sale
for the support of schools.
The act of 20 May 1826 does not authorize the inhabitants of any
township to exchange or give up their 16" Section or any part of it,
& take other lands in lieu thereof, but it is intended only to provide
school land for townships in which there is no section of that number,
or in cases where the section, from being fractional, contains a less
quantity than the township is entitled to by the ratio fixed by the act.
When Florida shall be admitted into the Union as a State, there
is but little doubt that she will be allowed an equivalent in other lands
for such sections N° 16 within her limits, as may be covered in whole
or in part by private claims or that may be otherwise disposed of by
Congress, as was the case with all the land States heretofore admitted.
In all cases where a selection is to be made for a township containing
a fractional 16" Section, such quantity only is to be selected as will,
with the area of the said fract' 16" sect" make the quota authorized
by the law.
There is no law granting to the Territories the sections surveyed as
N° 16 within their limits for the support of schools. They are only
at present to be considered as Reserved, & are to be withheld from
sale or entry of every description, except in cases where they may be
disposed of by special acts of Congress.
With respect to any selections that have been or may hereafter be
made under this act, of May 1826, you will bear in mind & so advise
those interested, that there is no law by which such selections can be
granted or confirmed to them, & that the action of the Department
can extend no farther than to withhold them from public sale & from
entry at private sale; as the provisions of the act are not extended to
the Territories & embrace only the States.
You will consider the selections enumerated in the list before men-
tioned, except such as are designated in the enclosed paper marked
N° 1, as null & void, & immediately advise this office, if they were
withheld from the public sales, in order (should such be the fact) that
measures may hereafter be taken to have them proclaimed by the
President, & offered at public sale. Should any of the selections have
been made subsequent to the offering at public sale of the townships,
the lands will then have to be treated in the manner pointed out by

the 9" article of the printed circular of the 1" January 1836, before
they can be again subject to private entry.
The tracts named in the paper N° 1, you will be pleased to enter
on your tract books & Plats as school selections, & withhold them
from private entry.

SIR. I have the honor to forward herewith for the consideration &
action of the Secretary of War a communication I have received from
Capt. Seawell 7 Infy Comdg Fort Brooke Tampa Bay, accompanied
by copies of instructions from the Hon Secretary to the Marshal of
East Florida under the several dates of June 13 1839* and July 17,
1840" also the instructions of the Marshal to his Deputy at Tampa
dated 29" Nov. 1841." It is unaccountable how the Marshal could
have a doubt as to his competency & consequently that of his deputy
to act in the premises after the reiterated instructions of the Secretary
of War. It cannot be expected, that as long as the persons complained
of by Capt. Seawell are not only shielded from the action of the law
by the imbecility of the civil officer whose duty it is to enforce it, but
thereby encouraged to carry on the nefarious trafic in liquor by which
they subsist, any thing like discipline among the troops can be
maintained.
I hope most earnestly the Hon' Secretary will perceive the impor-
tance of prompt and effectual action on the subject now submitted to
him. Similar removals might be urged at nearly all the Military
posts in this Territory.
I would respectfully suggest that the Military Reserve at Tampa
be surveyed as early as practicable & its boundaries be distinctly
marked.

the 6' of July last," to remove from this reserve, a Mr Collas, a Citizen,
who resides here with his family.—Two other citizens, a Mr Jackson
and a M. Warren, the Dept. Marshall was also requested to remove at
the same time, and he accordingly notified all of them to leave by the
7th ult.
On my return here from St Augustine on the 23" ult, I found that
the order of the Depty Marshall to the above named Citizens had been
disregarded; they still residing here, —and on calling on the Depty
Marshall, I was informed, that according to his instructions from M’
Sanchez, the Marshall of the Territory, citizens could not be removed
from this post or the reserve, except by order of Judge Steel, before
whom cause must be shewn, why they should not remain, and that he
must not remove them at the mere request of the Cmndg Officer of
the post.—A copy of these instructions are herewith enclosed.
The individuals I requested to have removed, are worthless drunk-
ards, and I request that the Cmndg Col will endeavor to have such
instructions given to the Marshall as will ensure their immediate
removal, and that of all others also, whenever it may be desired by
the Cmndg: Officer. I enclose herewith, copies of instructions from
the Secretary of War to the Marshall, of the 13th June 1839" and 17"

COL: J. H. WOSE 4" Infy. Comdg. 9" Dept. Cedar Keys Florida.
SIR; Intelligence has this day reached the War Department
that a party of fugitive Creek Indians (fifty) attacked the house
of a M. Perkins, near a place called Holmes' Valley, Washington
County, W. F. on the morning of the 31" ultimo, and murdered
him with all his family, except one child that made its escape. The
Indians who committed this outrage are said to be secreted between
the Bays of St. Andrews and Choctawhatchee and adjacent swamps.
With a view to afford prompt protection to the part of the country
infested by the Indians, as well as to pursue, capture and destroy
them, the Secretary of War directs that you select two efficient
Companies of Infantry, from the nearest point, with active enter-
prising officers, well skilled in Indian Warfare, and despatch them
forthwith on the duty herein indicated. You will give all the nec-
essary orders and instructions to the officer in command.
The Secretary of War, being anxious to adopt the most effectual
means at once to break up, and capture or destroy this band directs
that you authorize the officer commanding the detachment, to employ
not to exceed forty able bodied, active men, from among the in-
habitants of the region, to act as guides and assistants in the Scout,
for the period of one month. These volunteers are to equip them-
selves, (except that they may be furnished with powder & ball)
and are to provide their own horses, subsistence and forage, and
will be entitled to the rates of compensation heretofore allowed
by law to mounted volunteers.”—The leader of the party will be
allowed the pay, rations and forage of a Captain of mounted volunteers.
This auxiliary force will be placed under the orders of the officer
commanding the detachment of regular Troops.
The wishes of the men in respect to the selection of their leader,
should be consulted, and if there be no particular objection on their
part, and the officer in command approves him, Archibald Smith Jr.
of Gaston” County, may be selected.
The compensation to the men and their leader is to be paid in
money, at the rates of compensation for subsistence and forage
prescribed by Regulations, out of the fund for suppressing Indian

in Florida. Their continuance in the employment will depend on
circumstances.
Should any of the citizens employed require subsistence, the same
may be furnished from the United States supplies, charging the
person receiving, at the rate prescribed by Regulations.
It is desirable that as many of the United States troops detached
to this service should be mounted, as the supply of horses will permit.
You are authorized to offer a reward of $100 for every Warrior
taken and of $50, for every other Indian and to pay the same out
of the fund before mentioned, upon satisfactory proof of its being
earned.
The Commanding Officer of the Detachment will be directed
to report in duplicate all his movements, one copy to the Adjutant
General's Office, direct, and the other, of course, to you.

SIR. Being about to issue instructions to the Surveyor General of
Florida for immediate institution of proceedings necessary to effect
the public surveys of lands in those portions of the Peninsula of East
Florida, where settlements exist or are most likely to be commenced
under the late Act of Congress “to provide for the armed occupation
and settlement of the unsettled part of the Peninsula of East Florida”,”
I beg leave to enquire whether in case the Surveyor General should
be of opinion that the exigency so requires, it will suit the convenience
of the government to afford military protection to the Surveyor while
engaged in the field of their operations.
It is very probable that the Surveyor General will have to organize
three if not four parties of Surveyors to be engaged at the same time
in fields of duty remote from each other—In such event it may be
found necessary to afford protection to each party.
This communication is made on the suggestion of M Levy the
Delegate from the Territory and it would be highly desirable that

SIR; Your letter of the 13" instant to the Secretary of War, re-
questing a military escort for the protection of the Surveyors while
engaged in field operations in Florida, has been received; and in reply,
I am desired to say, it is not believed at this time, that there is the
least danger to be apprehended from the Indians in that part of Florida
about to be surveyed, and that a guard for the protection of the
Surveyors, is therefore considered altogether unnecessary. Should
the surveying parties however, when about to commence their field
operations, perceive any grounds of real danger, contrary to all ex-
pectations,—on application to the Commanding Officer in Florida, a
small guard for each party would be furnished.—

SIR By the third section of the Act of Congress, entitled “An Act
to provide for the armed occupation and settlement of the unsettled
part of the peninsula of East Florida”, approved 4" August 1842;
it is enacted, “That no right or donation shall be acquired under this
Act, within two miles of any permanent Military post of the United
States, established and garrisoned at the time such settlement and
residence was commenced”, It therefore becomes necessary in order
to communicate the proper instructions to the land Officers and the
Surveyor General for carrying out the above provisions of the law,
that this Office should be furnished with a list of all the permanent
Military posts in the peninsula South of the line specified in the Act,
to wit, the line which divides townships nine and ten South, likewise
a separate list of such as are only considered temporary, which I
respectfully request your direction to have done as early as convenient

SIR; Your communication of the 8* instant with enclosures,”
on the subject of the removal of intruders from the military reservation
at Fort Brooke, Florida, has been received and laid before the Secre-
tary of War.
It appears from Captain Seawell's Report, that the Deputy Marshal
at Tampa Bay will not remove intruders when requested so to do
by the Commanding Officer, unless he be instructed in each case,
by the County Judge, before whom cause must be shown why they
should not remain. This is strange indeed, the County Judge having
nothing to do with the subject whatever. The questions to be
answered are, —Is the land around the Fort public property, and has
it been reserved for national, or military purposes? And is the in-
dividual when ejectment is demanded by the United States Officer, a
resident within such military reservation? These questions answered
in the affirmative, the Marshal, or his Deputy, under the positive
instructions from the President, is left without discretion and must
accordingly proceed to remove the intruder from the public domain.
The Act of March 34 1807, entitled an “Act to prevent settlements
being made on lands ceded to the United States until authorized by
law,” gives the President power to remove all intruders on the
public lands, and points out the mode in which it shall be done.
This course has been pursued, and the United States Marshal for

the district of East Florida, Joseph S. Sanchez, was specially directed
by letter, dated June 13" 1839,” and again July 17* 1840,” to remove
all intruders from the lands around the military posts in Florida—
No additional instructions are therefore necessary, and if the Dep-
uty at Tampa Bay still refuses to remove the intruders as requested
by the Commanding Officer, complaint should be made to the Mar-
shal of the non-compliance and neglect of duty on the part of his
Deputy, and if he fail to take the necessary steps to carry out the
instructions of the President, the fact should be officially reported,
when, no doubt, the Executive, in such case, would find some other
person, more willing, or able, to execute his instructions and the
laws.
It is desirable that the intruders should be removed by means of
the civil authorities, as this prevents all clamor against the military,
which is most surely to be raised, regardless of the propriety of the
Military action, and legality of the procedure. But, if the object
cannot be effected in this way, other means must be resorted to.
For your information and that of the Commanding Officer of Fort
Brooke, I enclose herewith an authentic copy of the reservation of
sixteen miles square around that post which was set apart for mili-
tary purposes by President Jackson, December 10" 1830.
A copy of this communication (not of the plat) will be forwarded
to Captain Seawell, (or Commanding Officer) at Tampa Bay, but it
is necessary that you take requisite measures, and give the proper
instructions, in conformity therewith.”—

stating that Forts Micanopy, Waccassassa,” & Fanning,” are those
now occupied for temporary purposes.
In reply I have to state that the Land Officers & the Surveyor
General will be instructed accordingly to respect the three first men-
tioned posts in permitting or surveying settlements made under the
late law.
I have also to state for the information of the Department, that
it appears from the files of this office, that reservations have been
formally made by the President, at Forts Shannon & Brooke; also
at the “Cedar Keys”; (another point mentioned in the Adjutant
General's Report) & that copies of the papers connected with these
reservations are preparing at this office to be transmitted to the Bu-
reau of Top Engineers, under the printed circular of the Adjutant
General of the 1* inst, but that no such reservation appears to have
been ordered at Fort King, which is situated in the contemplated
new surveys.
I would therefore respectfully suggest, that immediate steps be
taken by the Department, to procure an order from the President
for the reservation at Fort King of four miles square (that being
about the quantity allowed by the armed occupation act) taking
the Fort as a centre, by lines running to the cardinal points of the
compass; & at the same time, as suggested in the letter from your
Department, for the reservation of such Islands near the coast for
military purposes, as the Department may select & designate on
the printed map: on receipt of all which at this office, the necessary
instructions will be communicated without delay.”

1842, entitled, “An Act for the Armed occupation and Settlement of
the unsettled “part of the Peninsula of Florida;” and have to call
your attention to the new surveys necessary to carry the same into
effect and for other purposes.”
It is desirable that the surveys should be so extended as to embrace
those points where it is probable the settlements will be formed, &
the lands will be wanted for market.
The red lines on the enclosed printed map of the peninsula published
by the War Department, have been laid down so as to include most of
these points, according to the best information in this Office, and I
have to request that you will without delay contract for the survey
thereof, and for the subdivisions into Sections of five full townships
to be selected in each of the blocks designated on the Map by the
broad pink line, and that you will transmit the duplicates or copies of
the Contracts and Bonds to this Office without delay.
Great care should be taken in running & marking the standard
Meridian line K. L. laid down on the Map, near Fort King, and the
standard parallels C. D. E. F. which if correctly surveyed, will serve
to limit any irregularities in the intermediate surveys, and prove use-
ful checks on the present and future field operations of your Deputies.
For the Survey of these lines, requiring more skill and attention, a
higher price might be allowed than for section lines, provided however,
that the average price given in all the Contracts, must not exceed the
maximum price of four dollars a mile allowed by existing laws for
surveying the public lands.
The townships to be subdivided have not been particularly desig-
nated on the Map, in order that you may select them upon information
to be derived from the Deputies, whilst the surveys of the standard
and exterior Township lines are progressing in the field, and from the
Registers and Receivers, with whom you are requested to confer.
The accompanying printed instructions require the Land Officers to
transmit to your Office from time to time the notices & Diagrams
upon which permits of settlement under the law are made. These
will aid you in selecting the townships to be first subdivided, and if
received in time will enable you to have each settlement surveyed
simultaneously with the section lines.
The settlements should, whenever practicable, conform to the Sec-
tion lines, they should likewise be represented on the Township Maps
by a distinctive color, say a pink shade, with the name of the Appli-
cant and the number of his notice written thereon.
As the permits cannot interfere with such groves of live Oak and
Red Cedar timber abounding on the public lands, as the proper De-

(see page 4, accompanying instructions,) you will be particular in
requiring your Deputies to note in their field Books where those tim-
bers exist, and you will cause them to be carefully and conspicuously
designated on the Township Maps.
In addition to the evidence on file in your Office, you will procure
from the Land Officers and the keeper of the public Archives at S*
Augustine, all necessary information of the boundaries of the con-
firmed and such unconfirmed private claims, as have been duly filed
with the Commissioners, the former of which you will have surveyed
and laid down on the plats in connection with the section lines, and
the latter, where they have been duly filed before any board of United
States Commissioners, you will of course not have surveyed, but cause
them to be laid down on the plats, shewing their connections, as near
as may be, by dotted lines, with the names of the claimants, the num-
bers of the claims, and the dates of the reports embracing them, in
order to protect them from sale or settlement until final action shall
be had thereon.
For all necessary details as to the mode of executing your contract
&°, you are referred to the Circular of instructions from this Office to
the Surveyor General of the 28* July 1831; (see Comp: Laws & In-
structions, Part II. page 915;*) to the Circular of instructions to
your predecessor of the 5" August 1839,” for limiting the size of the
Contracts; and to the instructions modifying the same of the 26"
January 1841.”—And you are hereby particularly charged not to em-
ploy any person a Deputy Surveyor, in whose capacity and moral in-
tegrity you have not the fullest confidence, and to require your Dep-
uties to employ men of good moral character only, as chain-carriers,
& assistants, so that you may certify without hesitation and on your
own Official responsibility to the correctness of their returns, after
applying all the tests in your power.
In a letter from the adjutant General of the War Department of the

SIR. I had the honor to receive on the 22" your letter of instruc-
tions of the 12" inst," at which time the runners previously despatched
to the Ocklocknee country & reported in my communication of the
15" " had not returned. They returned yesterday, and I regret to
report a failure. They found very recent signs of their friends &
would have continued the search but for the arrival of the boat at the
appointed time for them to return. They are anxious to go again,
and I shall indulge them in a few days. The Ocklocknee people are
represented as being destitute of ammunition & are doubtless in a
condition of wretchedness; they have no fixed abode & no means of
subsistence except what the particular locality at which they may
happen to be affords, a doubt therefore cannot reasonably be enter-
tained that if the intelligence of peace coupled with the promise of the
President that they may remain in Florida within the prescribed
limits can be conveyed to them, they will unhesitatingly accept the
terms & forthwith join their friends in the south. The Creeks of
Octiarchee's band, who are now ready to comply with the terms offered
them, have been promised in every interview that the U.S. troops
should not make another hostile movement unless the Indians should
fail to fulfil the conditions of the treaty. Since the first interview at
this place between Brig. Gen' Worth and Tiger-tail, several murders
have been committed by straggling Indians who knew nothing of the
armistice, & the Chiefs have appeared anxious to call in these men so
as to put a stop to all atrocities on their part, & thus give no cause for
a rupture on the part of the whites.” I have in every such instance
assured them that if they would continue firm in purpose & obey the
instructions of their “Great Father”, those isolated acts of their
young men, committed in ignorance of a cession of hostilities, should

not interrupt our friendly relations. Well Sir, they have so far ful-
filled, though slowly, every promise they have made & it was with no
less astonishment than mortification that I suddenly found myself
instructed by direction of the Secretary of War to forfeit every pledge
I had made to the Indians & pursue a course which in the present
state of affairs would in my opinion not only disperse those assembled,
under the proclamation for peace, but incite the entire Indian popula-
tion to acts of retalliation & revenge, inevitably tending to reproduce
a state of War. After much reflection upon the subject, I have deter-
mined, in view of all the circumstances which surround me, and under
the most unprejudiced conviction that it will be for the good of the
country, to suspend the execution of the Secretary's instructions of
the 12" until every effort on my part to find, by the aid of Indian
runners, the band against whom the operations are to be directed,
shall have failed. The commander of the Western District will be
instructed to concentrate the force intended for this service, at Fort
Stansbury,” & have them in readiness to move as rapidly as possible
to the theatre of action at a moments warning. Before the service
could be entered on, however, it would be necessary to purchase
horses and equipments for mounting a part of the detachment, (the
number in view of economy & cessation of hostilities having been
reduced throughout the Department, to the standard of a peace
establishment.) But if under the instructions he has received from
the Department of War, one of the companies should have been put
in march before my wishes shall reach him, which I do not apprehend,
he will be directed to detach another, and proceed himself to the scene
of the outrage, and without delay organize the force as directed and
carry out the wishes of the Secretary of War. Lt. Col° Hitchcock is
expected by the middle of October,-Capt. Morris who is an active
Officer & now commanding the Western District will then be available
for the command of the detachment. Capt. Clark now in command of
the Regiment is in such bad health as to be totally unfit for any active
service.
So long a time has elapsed since the murder, that no evil can
possibly result from a further delay of two or three weeks in which
time I shall hope to have found & pacified, if not brought in, the
whole band West of Ocklocknee. In that time too, there will be a
Steamer in service on which I can rely for the transport of the de-
tachment to a suitable point on the coast from which to direct the
operations. At present I have no boat en which can be safely trusted
at sea. I beg leave to remark, as my belief, that no possible benefit
will result from a scout in West Florida, I am satisfied there are

ground as he was acting as attorney at Law to defend those very
men who had committed this trespass and riot. But thank fortune
there are some men can be found in this place who are willing to see
Government righted, I applied to Mr. Gutterson formerly Deputy
Marshal under Col. Sanchez, he comes forward fearlessly and boldly
and render all assistance in his power, and says such conduct must
be put down, he is a magistrate.
I have got some others duties to perform against some men who
have been heavily trespassing upon public lands, and no doubt from
the information I received, I will be met and opposed by fire arms,
this will not timidate me I will perform my duty so long as I can
walk, when I cannot walk I will crawl to the spot. I am determined
to put a stop to such frauds upon Government, or I'll loose my life
in the attempt. I got up out of a sick bed to attend to the duties
above mentioned, In the mean time I was under the Doctors care
and he had given me 25 grains of Calomel a few hours previous, I
am now in good health.”

SIR. I now have the honor to report the determination of the
Creeks to go to the country assigned them in Florida, early in the
next moon. Octiarchee " left here this morning—Tiger tail is
dangerously ill, which I fear has been of serious detriment to the
cause of emigration. I had been assured that he & his followers
would go to Arkansas, but am now informed of their intention to

is possible his influence may yet cause his small band to adhere
to their original design.
Passacca " a man of note (brother of Cloud ") is here from Tampa
& informs me that Bowlegs * & Fush hadjo,” representatives of
the southern Indians in the first council with General Worth, had
violated all their promises & have been active in their efforts to pre-
vent any emigration from that quarter. They failed to distribute
the presents (Tobacco &c) sent their people by the General & were
studious to avoid discovering to them the tempting offers made
under authority from the President to all who would go to Arkansas.
However Passacca explained to those who came to Tampa the terms
and aided by the judicious management of Capt. Seawell I hope
to get a respectable party from the Cypress for the West.
In all the interviews with the Indians they have been told both
by my predecessor and myself, that the President gave them a choice
between the portion of this Territory assigned them and Arkansas
& that he was indifferent to their selection. It is therefore not
surprising that but few are disposed to emigrate attached as they
must be to Florida & having at hand without labor all the means
and facilities of subsistence.
In a few days I shall despatch friendly runners to the Ocklocknee
on another search for their people. Four were sent this morning
to look for the family supposed to be on the Homasassa "to whom
is conceded the authorship of the murder at Chocochattee.
I regret to report that information is every day coming to me
of the existence of a spirit of implacable resentment towards the
Indians in the vagabond class of the citizens of this Territory mani-
festing itself by threats to assemble in large bodies and make War
upon the Indians.
It is to be observed in this connection that during the active cam-
paigns of the last 18 months and when the Indians were constantly
murdering and plundering the citizens, not a man evinced a dispo-
sition to defend even his own fireside,--as a striking illustration
of this fact witness the affair at Mandarin,-but now that the Indians
are innoxious (such as have heard explained the terms of the treaty)
a most unaccountable desire for the toils and glory of the field appears
suddenly [to be manifested by] * hatching in the adverse party.

COL. J. H. WOSE 4" Inf Comdg. 9" Dept.
SIR: Your several communications on the subject of your command
and the affairs in Florida have been received, and laid before the
Secretary of War.
In reply to your letter of the 24" ulto." reporting the state of
negotiations with the Indians I am directed by the Secretary to say,
he doubts not that you will take the most efficient measures to prevent
any attacks on the Indians going south by the whites which you seem
to apprehend; and if the grounds for these apprehensions continue,
no pacific Indians should be permitted to travel to the south except
under a suitable escort of troops commanded by an officer.
In considering your dispatch of the 26"" relative to the special
instructions of the Department of the 12" of September," the Sec-
retary of War does not perceive any reasonable ground either for the
astonishment or mortification which you have expressed on the re-
ceipt of those instructions. The fugitive Creeks in West Florida had
been quiet for a long time, and they seem to have chosen the op-
portunity to gratify their ferocity when there was the least danger
of resistence or retaliation to be apprehended. When the intelligence
of the murder of Mr. Perkins' family was received it was the deter-
mination of the Department that the most prompt & vigorous meas-
ures should be taken to chastise these Indians. It was not supposed
nor is it now understood that any negotiations had been opened with
these particular Indians—indeed your letter shews the contrary, for
up to the time of its date they were not aware of what had been pro-
posed by General Worth [A.]." There was therefore, no breach of

faith in punishing them for these outrages. Nor was it known at the
Department at the date of the Special instructions, that you had sent
any agents to communicate with these Indians. I may add then that
there was no intended interference whatever with your arrangements,
and it is regretted that these circumstances had not been duly con-
sidered at the time, which doubtless would have saved you from feel-
ing any thing like astonishment or mortification. It should be borne
in mind, too, that you had made no pledges to these fugitive Creeks,
and therefore could not be called on to violate any."
Under the circumstances of the case, your delay in executing the
special instructions of the 12" of September is sanctioned by the De-
partment. The further delay of two or three weeks as you suggest
meets the approbation of the Secretary of War; but at the expiration
of that period, if these Indians do not come in, or give the most sat-
isfactory evidence of their readiness to do so, then the said special
instructions must be promptly executed.
In reference to the want of supplies to which you advert, I learn
from the Commissary General that the deficiency was owing to the
wreck of a vessel with provisions shipped at Baltimore the 11" of
August, and the condemnation of stores which had been received from
the Navy at Cedar Keys. On the 9" of September a second shipment
was made from Baltimore which must have arrived at Cedar Keys by
the 30" ult. unless ship-wrecked. Two other shipments of Stores
have been made from New York to Florida, on the 20" & 30" of
September. Should your supplies and means of transportation fall
short of the demand of the service as you seem to apprehend in your
letter of the 24" (which however is not anticipated,) you will of course
provide whatever may be necessary. And should you find yourself
straitened, and you deem it useful to engage guides and assistants to
aid the operations of the troops against the Indians and to protect the
inhabitants of Florida, you are authorized to do so from time to time,
in the manner pointed out in the special instructions of the 12" of
September; but the number will not exceed one hundred men in the
whole, to be employed for such time as may be necessary, not exceeding
two months for any one period of service. Their compensation to be
at the rates specified in the instructions referred to, and to be taken

CoL" J. H. VoSE 4th Inf. Comdg 9th Dept Cedar Keys Fla.
SIR: Your communication of September 29" " was yesterday re-
ceived and submitted to the Secretary of War.
The Secretary hears with much regret that any portion of the citi-
zens of Florida (those it is supposed who reside near the borders of
that part of the Territory formerly belonging to the Seminoles), now
that peace has been proclaimed and with every reasonable hope of its
continuance, manifest and express a disposition to renew, of them-
selves, hostilities against the few remaining Indians, who, from your
statement, appear disposed in good faith, to comply with their recent
engagements, and are actually moving down the peninsula to the
tract of land assigned, which is beyond the most advanced settlements
south.—This manifestation of feeling of hostility, so pernicious to the
public interest and so unworthy the white settler in the present state
of affairs, the Secretary hopes will soon pass off, and that they will
remain quiet at their homes and throw no obstacle in the way of the
Government in carrying out the peaceable plans now in due course of
execution. If however the reverse unhapily be the case, our first
duty is to fulfil the engagements which have been made with the
Indians and to protect them in their efforts to comply with the obli-
gations on their part. The Secretary of War, after consultation with
the President, therefore directs that at all hazards you must defend

It is hoped that your efforts to negociate with the Indians on the
Ocklockonee may prove successful, and that all yet out may soon
pass within the limits assigned them, when it will be comparatively
easy to carry on negotiations with them.”

MY DEAR SIR I thank you for your kind wishes as expressed in
your letter of 21" Int,” and would not now troble you but for the
interest your department takes in the preservation of the live oak
and other ship timber in Florida.
I understand and have no reason to question the fact, that parties
are forming in the North, under the pretence as settling in this coun-
try, & under the armed occupation law to take out the permits for
lands in order, to cut and ship off the live oak, and other valuable
ship timber, and then abandon the lands—
No settler, has any legal right to his land, untill he resided on it five
years, and cannot untill he has complied with the conditions of the
law, sell and dispose of its valuable timber, as an artile of trade—
If some order is not at once taken on this subject, the most valuable
timber will be cut & shiped out of this country—
The line designated, south of which permits are to be granted to
actual settlers—will cross from East Florida over the Suwannee River
taking in the finest live oak white, oak & red ceeder, in Florida, by
looking at the map you will see the line passes beyond Dead Mans
bay, west of the Suwannee river. This tract of country, is intirely
unsettled, and if any a person is not their to proect the timber, the
best will be taken off before March next—This tract of country, be-
tween the Suwannee & dead mans bay, has the most valuable ship

Office of the Solicitor of the Treasury Oct 18. 1842.
SIR In the absence of the Solicitor of the Treasury, I have the
honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of H. L. Thistle to the
Secretary of the Navy, dated the 13" Ultimo,” which with the ac-
companying copies of letters from Thistle to Mess: Palmer and Ferris,"
was referred to this office, and respectfully report, that whenever the
“agent for the preservation of timber and wood on public lands in
Florida” makes complaint to the District Attorney against an in-
dividual for cutting live oak &" on public lands it is not the duty, of
the person so charged, to prove that he is not guilty of trespassing
upon the public lands by exhibiting his title, before the Agent shall
have introduced evidence to prove that the cutting was upon the
public lands. In other words, the agent must make out the case
affirmatively by proof–his oath is not sufficient to throw upon a
respondent the proof of his title. As M." Thistle, argues, it may be
“easy for him to show his own lines;” but facility is not to be trans-
muted into legal obligation.
The act of 3rd March 1827.77 Section 3rd authorises the President to
take proper measures to preserve the live oak timber growing on the
lands of the United States, and to reserve from sale such lands be-
longing to the United States, as may be found to contain live oak, or

other timber, in sufficient quantity to render the same valuable for
Naval purposes.
Whenever timber shall be cut on those public lands which have
been reserved for the purpose of furnishing a supply of live oak and
red cedar timber for the Navy, it becomes the duty of the said Agent,
of the officers of the Customs, and of the land officers, to cause prose-
cutions to be seasonably instituted against all persons known to be
guilty of depredations on, or injuries to the live oak growing on such
lands. This general remark, covers all the points of his letter on the
subject of depredation. If the lands be reserved, and the timber be
cut, his duty to prosecute at once attaches—and he must make out
his case affirmatively. If the lands have not been reserved, I see
nothing which prevents an individual from settling on lands on which
there is live oak &" under the act of 4" August 1842. if he comply
with its requisitions, undesirable as it may be to the government.

pacification and consent immediately to remove, they must be treated

exposed to their caprices. They must come to terms of peace at once,

SIR, By an Act of the last Congress, entitled “An Act to provide
for the settlement of certain accounts for the Support of Government
in the Territory of Wiskonsin, and for other purposes,” approved
29th August 1842," it is made “the duty of the Secretary of each
Territory, to prepare the Acts, passed by the Legislature of each Ter-
ritory, for publication, and to furnish a Copy thereof to the public
printer of the Territory, within ten days after the passage of each
Act.” The imposition of this duty, though a new & laborious one,
I should not complain of, had sufficient time been allowed me for its
performance. But being thrown upon me during the Session of the
Legislature, at a time when my other engagements and duties, as
Secretary, keep me busily employed, it will be necessary for me to
employ a clerk, to be enabled to furnish a copy of each Act of the
Legislature to the public printer, within ten days after its passage.
I would, most respectfully, ask whether it is expected that I shall
pay for this clerk hire out of my own Salary, or whether, under the
circumstances, the Government will not be willing to allow me some
compensation for the expense which I must incur in the discharge of a

HIS EXCELL’Y R, K. CALL
SIR, I will thank you to include in your estimate of Territorial
expenses for the present year, the cost of 3 large Bookcases ($120)
which John W. Levinus, under a contract with me, made for the Sec-
retary's office, during the past Summer.
On assuming the duties of that office, I found every thing belonging
to it, in a state of great confusion. The papers, books and public
documents had increased to such an extent, that the three cases al-
ready in the Office were filled, and there remained a large quantity on
the floor, enclosed in the boxes, in which they were originally sent. I
found also, that the room in which the Office was kept, was too small
to contain all the papers, books &c, and, with your approbation, have
since moved a large portion of them, into an adjoining one.—In the
two rooms, jointly, there is plenty of space to admit of every thing
belonging to the Office, being properly preserved, and arranged in
order. But to effect this, I thought it absolutely necessary to have
the three additional cases, above mentioned, made. Of the necessity
of this measure, your knowledge of the previous condition of the office
will enable you to judge. The cost of these cases ($40 each) may be
thought extravagant. But they are neat, large and substantial,

STEPHEN DANIEL, Esqr. Marianna, Florida.
SIR, I am surprised at the contents of your letter of the 22"
ultimo," just received, and exceedingly sorry that there should have
been such a total misunderstanding of the intentions and plans of the
Department. Mr Levy was informed that the United States' officer,
in command of the Army in Florida would be instructed to employ
forty guides and assistants with their own Captain, to co-operate with
the United States troops, but under the charge of the commander of
the United States against the hostile Indians who had recently com-
mitted outrages in Florida.” The whole matter was to be arranged
and executed by the Colonel or Officer commanding, and it was never
contemplated that any company should organize itself, or that any
person should take a single step until called on by the Officer in com-
mand. It is impossible to recognise this company, and it should
immediately disperse, as it cannot be allowed to conduct any opera-
tions against the Indians without the express direction, and under the
immediate control of Officers of the Army.
Although the Department is in no way responsible for what has
been done, it does not the less regret the occurrence and the incon-
venience to which the members of the company may be exposed.”

SIR. I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication
of the 27" Ult”, suggesting the propriety of your going in person
to St Augustine for the purpose of procuring certificates of private
claims from the public Archives, and other useful information for
the correct & speedy prosecution of the new surveys lately ordered,
& on which subject you request the views of this Office.”
In reply I have to state, that it appears to me, that the necessary
information could be obtained by opening a correspondence with
the proper Officers at S" Augustine, at the same time it is highly
probable, as you remark, that if on the spot you would be enabled to
expedite the business and collect much useful collateral information.
If therefore, as soon as your present pressing duties shall permit
you to absent yourself from your Office, you shall think proper to
go to St Augustine for a few weeks, I see no objection, but it must
be at your own expense, as I do not feel authorized under the circum-
stances to permit the use of the Surveying Appropriation for the
purpose.

particularly specify the claims, concerning which you desire informa-

and volume of the American State papers published by Duff Green,"
and at the same time, transmit copies of the lists to this Office, in
order that it may be advised of the particular claims, on which you
are acting. It would be proper, to give your application a form that
will enable the Officers to give you the information sought for in the
most comprehensive manner, thus for example, send or take with you
a paper referring first to the name of the claimant—N°. of claim-
and the date of the report embracing it–reference to the volume &
page embracing it, and under a coption of information desired, state

by a map shewing the division lines of the Land Districts, the line
south of which the locations are authorized to be made, and the new
Surveys which have been ordered, all which will afford you ample

You will perceive that the Northern boundary of the “armed
occupation” district is a parallel extending East from Deadman's Bay,
past the post of Pilatka on the St John's River, to Matanzas Inlet;
and that the whole peninsula South of that line is open to location
under the law; also that applications are to be made to the Land
Officers at Tallahassee, Newnansville or St Augustine according as
the lands are situated in one or other of those Districts.
I will mention for your information that it is designed to accompany
the annual report of this Office to be laid before Congress at its ap-
proaching Session, with a copy of the above map, in order that it may
if deemed expedient be printed for Circulation. In the meantime,

WAR DEPARTMENT November 28” 1842.
MR. JAMES W. LONG, Holmes' Valley Florida.
SIR, Your letter of the 16" instant is just received." You were
correctly informed by the Hon. Mr. Levy of his interview with me,
and of the substance of the instructions which I told him would be
given. They were given accordingly to Colonel Vose, then in com-
mand in Florida, but of course, so far discretionary that a change of
circumstances would justify a departure from them. Colonel Vose
believing that the Indians referred to had not been informed of the
arrangements made with other Indians and the terms of pacification
offered to all, deemed it his duty first to apprise them of these things,
and for that purpose dispatched messengers to them. By a series of
untoward accidents, it seems the messengers have not yet been able
to find the Indians and have not reported the result. Proceedings
have been suspended by Colonel Wose and by General Worth solely
for the purpose of endeavoring to bring in the Indians referred to in
a shorter time and easier manner, than by hostile movements. Gen-
eral Worth, however, in a communication of a late date, says, that
unless he has satisfactory accounts speedily, he shall at once execute
the original instructions given to Colonel Wose. The subject has
afforded occasion for frequent correspondence with the Officers in
command in Florida. The information contained in your letter, of
the inability of the inhabitants who have been scouting, to find any
Indians, would seem to indicate that any efforts of that nature, would
be hopeless.
With respect to the company of woodsmen, as you term them,
Colonel Vose was authorised to employ forty men as guides and AS-
sistants, to act under his directions. Of course, however zealous and
patriotic the persons were, who undertook to raise a company without
such employment and without any authority whatever, upon the
mere anticipation that some body would be employed, it is impossible
that their service can be recognized by the Department. Should
General Worth send a force to that quarter, he may think proper to
muster the men who have been engaged in scouting, and it will be
for him to determine from what time their service is to commence.
I trust that in the arrangements made you will perceive some
evidence of the desire of this Department to afford all the protection
which the nature of the case admits, to the inhabitants of Florida.
Your suggestions in relation to the Indians in question, are deemed

PALMER AND FERRIS TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
[NA:ND, SN Live Oak Lets.:LS]
[November 1842]
TO THE HON SECy OF THE NAVY
SIR: On the 23" of Sept last we received notice from Capt H L
Thistle” “Agent for the preservation of Timber & Wood on Public
Lands in East Flo”" that certain parcels of Live Oak Timber now
lying in the water near Trout Creek were under seizure by him as
having been cut by us on Public Land in this Territory
The Timber in question was cut for the Norfolk Navy Yard from
several different private tracts of land, and was paid for as such by
us; it was rafted to its present location in order to be ready for shipping
as the water was deeper at that place than any other near us.
Capt Thistle, at the Same time notified us, and also gave public
Notice that the Timber would be sold at public Auction on the 20"
Oct last, and thus far it remains under his seizure, and no sale has
been made of it—
The course that Capt Thistle is pursueing is extremely embarrassing
to us—We have at the present moment a Wessel chartered & laying
here at the expense of demurage, which if this Timber was free from
seizure, we might load her with, and give immediate despatch for
the North.
Our Timber is procured with great labour & expense and we have
invariably endeavoured to procure it from private grants & have
confined ourselves in cutting, to the lines & corners of the Grants,
as laid down on the plats procured from the Office of the Public
Archives at St Augustine and it is no More than just that after we
have procured and paid for it, that we should have the privelidge of
shipping it without any obsticles being thrown in our way.
Capt Thistle has however laid an injunction on all Timber which
may be shipped from this Place—and he has ordered the Dep’ Collec-
17 See Worth to the Adjutant General, Nov. 26, 1842 (NA,WD, AGO Lets.

tor not to clear any vessel having it on board—and as the case now
stands, without the proper Department takes some action upon it,
it is useless for us to get out Timber to fulfill our Contracts to Your
Department.
We have always endeavoured to be as prompt as possible in the
fulfillment of our contracts—and have always avoided depredating
on Public lands. We are always willing and able to pay for our
Timber & have always procured & shipped it without difficulty,
until the present Agent commensed his duties in this place. It has
always been our aim to avoid coming into collision with him—and
no person would offer him facilities of carrying out the duties of his
office sooner than ourselves; but it seems, we are the individuals he
has thought proper to choose as the subject of his persecution—and
he has thus far done every thing in his power to injure us. While
at the same time we have extended to him our aid in supplying him,
with whatever stores we have had on hand, for the consumption of
our own hands without advance on the first cost & expense of ship-
ping—In regard to the private Grants in this Country, most invariably
in all of them there arises some difficulty. They have been surveyed
in so loose a manner, that the lines & corners as designated, gives
more Land than the Grants call for. Capt Thistle contends they
have a right to only the Quota of Land called for. while the claimants
contend for all the land within their lines. & consequently they will
sell all the Timber embraced in their claims—it seems not that they
have a right so to do. & they trust to law & justice to uphold them in
this right—Be pleased Sir, to advise us what course to pursue in the
seizure made by Capt Thistle. We are undicided & wish to act
according to the dictates of the law—in such cases made & provided–
We are willing to trust to Your decision in the case, and we are con-
fident, you will extend to us justice & take a correct view of the
subject—But we cannot concede to the whims & caprices of Capt
Thistle, as it would be ruinous to us, indeed rather than so, we would
prefer relinquishing our Contracts—however great the sacrifice
might be to us. If Capt Thistle would persue any course sanctioned
by law, we would know what to do. but as he acts regardless of all
statutes, we are constrained to lay the case before You—and will
await Your answer, trusting You will act on it as soon as practicable-
We would farther add—that under the practice of the former Agents—
(Aiken & Mason) when doubts arose as to the title of land on which
live oak timber had been cut: their practice was to take a bond-
conditioned for the delivery of the timber to the Navy Yard according
to our contracts—leaving the question to be after settled as to the
title of land upon which it was cut-deducting from our contract

Georgia and Florida to constitute the settlements above named. On
our arrival at these places, it was rumored that Col. Worth had no

settlers, and legal advice confirming the rumour, doubts and un-

[NA:TD, Lets. from Collectors:ALS]
Collector’s office ST: AUGUSTINE December 2" 1842
SIR: I have the honor to enclose herewith my monthly account
of money received and expended during the past quarter.
A Settlement is now forming at and near a place, named Fort
Pierce, lately occupied as a military post, at the mouth of Indian river,
within this district and about two hundred miles South of St:
Augustine, several of the inhabitants of which have already gone
there, to locate lands under the act past at the last session of Congress,
and some have already, I understand entered their locations and
obtained permits.—Ten heads of families with some eight or ten slaves
have arrived in town from Georgia on their way to that place, and left
yesterday in the schooner B. H. Field for Indian river, they state that
one hundred more settlers are ready to follow them, destined for the
same place, and wishing to avail themselves of the bounty offered by
the Government.—
The bar of Indian river is deep enough for schooners and steamboats,
I have myself seen in 1838, seven and eight vessels at the same time
inside the bar, and as may be perceived by reference to the map,
Indian River, together with St: Lucie sound and Jupiter narrows,
forms a single sheet of water of some three degrees and half of latitude
in length,-navigable for vessels of light draught, a steamboat, the
Muscogee, was in 1838, if I remember, employed by Genl Jesup trans-
porting troops and provisions from Fort Pierce to Jupiter narrows.—
This river is even now visited by wreckers, and offers them from its
vicinity to the Florida reefs, and to others from the very short distance
which separates it from Cuba and the Bahamas, when settled so as to
afford security, a place of resort and deposite, from which merchandise,
sugar, tobacco and segars in particular, could be shipped to any ports
of the United States, as Florida produce.—I would therefore suggest
the propriety of appointing an inspector to reside at Indian River,
with a permanent salary, as no capable person, willing to execute his
duty faithfully and devote his time to its performance, could accept
the appointment, if paid only when employed, when moreover vigilance

would be necessary and entries for some time to come be probable
rare. four hundred perhaps three hundred dollars might insure a com-
petent person particularly with the prospect of an increase of com-
pensation, should the duties become arduous. A boat would also be
necessary, the bar being five miles distant from Fort Pierce, about
the nearest point on the main land, and two other inlets Gilbert's
and Jupiter both also outlets of this sheet of water, contenually open-
ing and closing, offering when open a channel sufficiently deep to be
used and often used by wreckers, these two latter inlets, the first about
thirty miles, the second fifty five South of Fort Pierce are I beleive
included in the District of Key West.
Should it be deemed necessary under these circumstances to appoint
an inspector for Indian river, I will endeavour to find a competent
person to fill the office.
An inspector was, before the war, stationed at New Smyrna near
the Mouth of Musquito inlet, which place, I beleive will soon be re-
settled, more numerously than before, in that event, I would also
require information in relation to the course proper to be pursued.
I have, Sir, imposed at some length on your attention, may I trust
that my desire of fulfiling, what I deem my duty, in pointing out what
the emigration now directing itself to this territory, appears to render
necessary, may be a sufficient excuse.

SIR Our Court at S*Augustine adjourned “Sine die” on Saturday
the 3" Inst at 3 'clock P.M.: and the next day I was compelled to
leave home to attend the term at this place which commenced on the
5* Inst: it will therefore be impossible for me to make my report for
the term at S*Augustine before my return from the Circuit: Gov"
Duval" attended at S*Augustine throughout the term, and every
effort was made both by him and myself (that could with propriety
be made) to press the land cases to a final hearing and yet no case
was finally decided: in some insuperable difficulties interposed:—The
three Cases of the Arredondos, amounting together to 346,000 acres
were continued on motion of the claimants, founded upon a shewing
by affidavits which the Court after a very full argument held to be
sufficient, so that the duties of the Attorney of this District, in the
land Cases are not yet lessened; on the Contrary they will be materially
increased during the ensuing year by a reference back from the Supreme
Court of Seventeen Cases: Seven of them for dismission: but ten of
them amounting to 255,000 acres are remanded for further proceedings,
so that the claims yet to be acted upon by the Court amount of
between 700,000 & 800,000 acres
In addition to which, difficulties have arisen about the boundaries
of other tracts which have been heretofore confirmed by the Supreme
Court, with directions to the Superior Court of this District “that
such further and other proceedings be had in such causes as according
to right & justice and the laws of the United States ought to be had.
the writ of Error notwithstanding”—under which general order, as
the Court before the Cases were carried up had power to direct a
Survey in given cases) it has been thought by the Counsel for some of
the Claimants, that it still possesses the power; & the question has
been informally presented to the Court, whether it can now in such
cases order a survey; and should a motion for that purpose be sustained
(as I think highly probable) orders for surveys will be applied for in a
number of these cases,
As the lands in East Florida are about to be generally surveyed
by the United States it is exceedingly important, not only to the
Claimants, but to the Government, that all these vexed questions of
boundary should be speedily & correctly settled. the duties therefore

My reluctance at all times to interfere in any manner, with the con-
duct, and action of our public servants, has restrained me from com-
municating to your department some months before this, the signular
and harrassing conduct and assumption of power which has been & is
now exercised by Mr. Thistle, the Agent sent here for the preservation
of the live oak and other ship timber growing on the lands of the United
States. This man may be and no doubt is anxious to render all
the service in his power to the Government, but from what I know
of his mind, and conduct, it is my opinion, he is not quite sane
He is actually exercising more authority than your whole depart-
ment, The President of the United States—does not claim half the

He is seising on all timber, that he finds cut, and even on the common
light wood for fires unless the Individuals, will prove to him they
did not cut it on the public domain—constituting himself the Judge,
jury, and marshal. The consequence is that on this docket of the
Superior court for this county—some eight or ten perhaps more
suits are pending in reation to the trespass committed by the Agent,
or as he thinks committed by individuals on the timber which he
says belong to the United States. I suppose there is not ten acres
of public land on either side of the St. Johns river for one hundred
and fifty miles above its mouth—These private claims have not
(but in a few instances) been yet surveyed—Mr Thistle, is acting
also as the Surveyor General, in surveying and demarking the bound-
ary of such private claims, according to his construction of their
form & location—He has issued I am told an order to the collector,
as to his duty in clearing vessels. freighted with lumber—And the
District Attorney for the United States here, has no influence with
the Agent—because the latter entertains no doubt of his own superior
legal learning over the District Attorney—I have understood, that
a quantity of ship timber procured some time since by some contractors
for your Department & which did not answer for the objects designed,
has been taken by the Agent & shiped north to some Navy yard, at
the expence of the United States, and for which no doubt the govern-
ment will have to pay some five or six thousand Dollars—It is quite
probable the expenses incured by the Agent will be found greatly
beyond any thing contemplated by your Department. The Depart-
ment would find its greatly to the interest of the United States, to
appoint its Agent from among the gentlemen who are acquainted
with this portion of the Territory, and have an intimate knowledge
of the private land claims; and of the Inhabitants—Their is not a
man so well quallified in every respect to fulfull the duties of Agent,
as Co" Joseph S. Sanches the late marshal of this district—He is
well acquainted with the private land claims, has seen more of this
portion of Florida than any other person, is known and respected
by the people every where—and is one of the most, inteligent bold,
and efficient officers that ever served the United States—This gentle-
man, would be of more real service in preserving the ship timber for
[MS. torn], that half a dozen such as the acting agent—If you con-
tinue the incumbent your department will be put to serious trouble &
inconvenience if not expence
I have ever taken a decided interest in the preservation of our
valuable ship timber in Florida knowing that it is the only quarter
of the Union where such valuable timber can now be obtained in
any quantity *-

WILLIAM P. DUVAL TO CHARLES B. PENROSE
[NA:JD, Sol. Treas., Lets. re Lands: ALS *]
Florida. JACKSONVILLE December 12" 1842.
CHARLES B. PENROSE Esqr Solicitor of the Treasury
SIR. The land suits pending in the Superior court at St. Augustine
were continued upon strong affidavits made by the parties—The Dis-
trict Attorney and myself made every exertion to bring up the cases
for trial, and warmly contested the right of the parties after so much
delay, to continue the causes; but our objections were overruled by
the court, as it concieved the affidavits, intitled the parties to the con-
tinuance they solicited. I regret this postponement as I had devoted
my time for several months in preparing myself to argue these cases
which it is probable I shall never do, as my Agency in behalf of the
United States will terminate with the present year.
The interest of the United States, so far from becoming less, in the
defence of the land claims in this Territory, will for two years, continue
highly important.
Most of the concessions, or grants, in this territory, (taken up to,
and confirmed by the Supreme Court) do not make the surveys the
basis of the decrees—but generally the opinion of the court goes only
to the confirmation of the grant, or concession according to its locall-
ity or calls—I state from my own knowledge that in many cases the
surveys made under the Spanish Authorities, are at places very dis-
tant from the lands discribed in the grants. It will therefore become
necessary for the courts here to order surveys to be made surveys
to be made in conformity to the grants. Many of the grants are
so vague, and uncertain, it will be impossible to locate them, and in
those that can be located, lands at other points, and distant from the
calls of the concession or grants have, been improperly surveyed.
Many of the surveys as returned by Clarke & other surveyors
under the Spanish, rule in East Florida, were manufactured in the
Chimney corner, nor did they ever go on the land to mark a corner or
a line. The cases now pending in the Superior court at St Augustine
including those remanded by the Supreme court for further proceed-
ings, do not involve less, than seven hundred thousand acres of land.
It is impossible to say with any certainty, what number of acres will

be in controversy, if the surveys should be made to conform to the
grants—It seems to me in many of the cases, it will become necessary
for some legal and competent Agent of the United States, to attend
on the ground, and direct the form of the surveys in behalf of the
Government, while the claimants also have his survey delineated
on the platt, as he may deem proper, so the court may be enabled
to decide justly between the parties—The duties of the District At-
torney will under this state of the land claims be increased for the
next two years greatly—From my examination of many of the grants,
& comparing them with the surveys it is evident that the grantees
have sought out the best lands without regard to the calls of the
grants. If these surveys are admitted as valid, the parties of course
may cull the finest lands in the Territory, without refference to their
location according to their grants—
If the law of the last session of congress repeating all the powers
granted to the law Agent & district Attorney ahould remain un-
changed it does not require much foresight to perceive that the inter-
est of the United States in the soil of Florida will be sacrificed

Cape St. Blas, as your Memorialists believe that such lights are nec-

essary to the safe navigation of vessels into this port by the West Pass.
In support of this petition your Memorialists respectfully repre-
sent: That in the early settlement of Apalachicola, while her Com-
merce and Exports were small, a Light House was erected on the
West end of St. George's Island," as a guide to vessels entering the
West Pass to this port. Experience has shown the location to be such
as destroys its usefulness, it being a mere harbor light, obscured by
Cape St. George, and cannot be seen by vessels approaching the
coast till long after they make the land, it being an invariable custom
to fall in to the eastward, because of the easterly trade winds, and to
avoid the westerly currents. In erecting a Light House at St. Joseph's
Bay, the location has proved still more unfortunate, being also a har-
bor light and in no degree useful to Commerce, as that port is entirely
abandoned for commercial purposes.
The commercial importance of Apalachicola is shewn by the Ex-
ports of Cotton, which amount to upwards of one hundred thousand
bales per annum. These exports, with various other products are
rapidly increasing, as the new lands in Florida and portions of Alabama
and Georgia are brought under cultivation. They are all dependant
upon Apalachicola for a market; they give employment to a large
number of vessels in the coasting and foreign trade, and it is there-
fore indispensible to the welfare of the City, and the security of its
trade, that Lights should be erected on Cape St. George and Cape St.
Blas, and that those before mentioned be discontinued, retaining the
buildings as beacons for vessels entering the harbor. The loss of life
and property has been considerable, in consequence of a deficiency of
lights to indicate the entrance between the two Capes above-men-
tioned. During the last year, the Brig Garland, cargo and several
lives, were lost on Cape St. Blas, which your memorialists believe
might have been avoided by good lights on these points.
Your Memorialists further pray, that measures be immediately
adopted for building a Marine Hospital at this port. Under present
arrangements, the condition of sick and disabled seamen cannot be
made in any degree comfortable, the amount allowed for their board
and support not being sufficient to procure such lodging and attend-
ance as is required. In the opinion of your Memorialists, it is only
necessary for Congress to be made acquainted with these facts, to in-
sure a favorable reception and grant of their petition.
Your Memorialists believe that great injustice has hitherto been
done to this port, and the interests of those engaged in its trade, from
a misapprehension as regards the position and advantages for trade,
and real commercial importance of the place. The causes producing

this misapprehension, your Memorialists believe no longer exist;
Apalachicola has now, and must for all time to come have, the entire
trade of the country bordering on the Flint, Chattahoochee, Apalachi-
cola and Chipola Rivers, and it is but reasonable to suppose, that
her Exports will in a few years more than double its present amount;
and that her imports will also in time, bear some near proportion to
the large amount of her foreign exports. The amount of duties on
imports at this port, is at present small, but it should be remembered
that most of the foreign merchandize consumed in this district is en-
tered at northern ports, and from thence shipped to this place. Your
Memorialists believe that the justice of granting the appropriation
necessary to carry into effect the objects sought by their memorial,
will be fully admitted, when it is considered that the amount of foreign
goods here consumed is equal in proportion to the exports, compared
with other sections of the United States, and that these exports and
imports give employment to about three hundred vessels and steamer,
whose tonage for this year is estimated at fifty thousand tons, and
which have in their employ near three thousand men.
Your Memorialists further pray that reference be had to the ac-
companying Chart, Statistical Table and Memorial from ship masters,
which, in the opinion of your Memorialists will fully establish the
facts herein set forth.

Preamble and Resolution Passed at the Legislative Council of the
Territory of Florida.
WHEREAS, the trade between the towns of Apalachicola and St.
Joseph, and the commercial cities of the Union, has increased to an
extent calling for the notice and protection of the General Govern-
ment: And whereas, all vessels bound to and from those ports, as well
as those employed in the coasting trade between New Orleans and St.
Marks, are necessarily exposed to the dangerous navagation around
Cape St. Blas, which is regarded by mariners as the Hattaras of the
Gulf, its shoals projecting from eight to ten miles to sea, and which in
many instances has proved dangerous to human life and destructive

to property; And whereas, a Light House erected on the most eligible
point on said Cape, would be eminently useful to all vessels bound in
to Apalachicola and St. Joseph, or employed in the coasting trade.
Be it therefore resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council of the
Territory of Florida, That our Delegate in Congress be requested to

MY DEAR SIR, Mr Robert B. Semple lately appointed by you
Receiver of public monies at this place " has just informed me of his
intention to visit Washington with a view of representing to the
Department the total inadequacy of his present Salary to afford him
a bare support. He thinks under existing Laws it can & ought to be
increased.
In justice to himself & to the Government also, I am, with all due
deference, of the same opinion.
The Receiver here is only allowed $500. p" an. For the last two
years he has not derived more than a hundred dollars I understand,
as a p" centage upon the whole am" of Receipts upon Land Entries.
This am" will fall far short—say some $400, of giving an actual sup-
port to a single man at this most expensive place.
I can only express the hope that it may comport with Your own
views Sir, & those of Your Secretary to allow M* Semple a reasonable
Salary & retain him in the service of the Government. I have no
doubt he will make a most efficient & valuable officer.
Should M Semple decline the office I would recommend as his
successor M. Robert H. Booth whö is most favorably known to you as
a highly esteemed citizen of Petersburg & who was strongly supported
for the office of Post Master at that place.
M* Booth I understand would be willing to come to Florida, if
a fair inducement were offered—I may add that he possesses the rare
qualification of being able to give the fullest quarantee—Having a
large & very influential connection in this country. His appointment
would of course be popular."

to you by Richard S. Hackley on the 21. of November last,” in regard
to certain lands in Florida claimed by him. I have given the case
such attention as my other engagements would permit, and beg
leave to submit the following report.
On the 6" of February 1818, the King of Spain, granted to the
Duke of Alagon, at his request certain uncultivated land, not ceded,
in East Florida. There was no pecuniary consideration for the
grant, judging from the deed itself. On the 27. of June 1818. Gov.
Coppinger, gave to D. Nicholas Garrido resident of S* Augustine
and Attorney for the Duke of Alagon, possession of all the lands so
granted. On the 29" of May 1819. the Duke of Alagon conveyed
to Richard S. Hackley & Co the lands included within certain bound-
aries in the deed set forth.

By the 2" article of the Treaty between the United States and
Spain of the 22" of February 1819. His Catholic Majesty ceded to
the United States, all the Territories which belonged to him situated
to the eastward of the Mississippi, known by the name of East and
West Florida, the adjacent Islands &" “which are not private prop-
erty”.” By the 8" article of the Treaty “all the grants of lands
made before” the 24" of “January 1818. by his Catholic Majesty,
or by his lawful authorities in the said Territories, ceded by his
Majesty to the United States, shall be ratified and confirmed to the
persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same
grants would be valid, if the Territories had remained under the
dominion of his Catholic Majesty. But the owners in possession of
such lands, who, by reason of the recent circumstances of the Spanish
Nation and the revolutions in Europe, have been prevented from
fulfilling all the conditions of their grants shall complete them within
the terms limited in the same respectively, from the date of this
treaty; in default of which, the said grants shall be null and void.
All grants made since the said 24" of January 1818. when the first
proposal on the part of his Catholic Majesty for the cession of the
Florida's, was made, are hereby declared and agreed to be null & void.”
In the ratification of the Treaty by the King of Spain, on the 24
of October 1820. there is this passage “Desirous at the same time of
avoiding any doubt of ambiguity concerning the meaning of the 8"
Article of the said Treaty, in respect to the date which is pointed out
in it as the period for the confirmation of the grants of lands in the
Florida's made by me, or by the competent authorities in my Royal
name which point of date was fixed in the positive understanding of
three grants of land made in favor of the Duke of Alagon the Count
Punonrostro, and Don Pedro de Vargas,” being annulled by its tenor,
I think proper to declare that the said three grants have remained,
and do remain entirely annulled and invalid; and that neither the three
individuals mentioned, nor those who may have title or interest
through them, or in any manner; under which explicit declaration the
said 8” article is to be understood as ratified.”
The question then arises is the grant made by the King of Spain
to the Duke of Alagon, valid, notwithstanding the declaration con-
tained in the ratification of the King? On this point M Hackley has
* See text of treaty with Spain, Feb. 22, 1819, in Hunter Miller (ed.), Treaties

letter.

furnished to you, the opinion of many distinguished jurists, all favor-
able to his claim.
On the 4" of August last, the act entitled “An act to provide for
the armed occupation and settlement of the unsettled part of the
Peninsula of East Florida”, was approved." By the first section it
is provided “that any person being the head of a family, or single man
over eighteen years of age, able to bear arms, who has made or shall
within one year from and after the passage of this act, make an actual
settlement within that part of Florida situated and being south of the
line dividing townships numbers nine and ten south, and East of the
base line, shall be entitled to one quarter section of said land,” on
certain conditions.
The eighth section enacts “that the President of the United States
may, at any time, by proclamation, suspend all further permits and
settlements under this act, by giving three months notice thereof.”
M* Hackley having fortified himself with many favourable legal
opinions, submits them for your consideration together with his pro-
test; and a letter from his counsel." The reason assigned for such
course is, an apprehension that the act of Conrgess which I have just
cited may be made to operate to his disadvantage. He remarks in
his protest as follows; “the terms of the act though equivocal may be
understood and it is said, have at the land office in Washington been
interpreted, to give for the choice of the Districts the range of the
whole Peninsula of East Florida; and, so, to include the lands belong-
ing to me. It is therefore, that I use the earliest occasion to invoke
the deliberation of the Executive and as resolutely as solemnly, to
protest against the trespass on my rights, which may be contemplated
by any appropriation of my lands under colour of this act of Congress;
if such be at all in contemplation. I ask the Executive to pause,
when in the path of his discretionary power, I oppose a title so en-
forced by muniments of highest import and dignified by considerations
of authoritative claim, interwoven with the genius of our institutions,
and the vital principles of all social security. I fear not to bring my
pretensions to the judicial test. To that arbitrament, I am entitled;
and no forcible movement of the United States should anticipate it,
and, by such an attempt to subdue me to its exaction, constrain me
me to be a suitor for redress or a suppliant for Congressional justice.
I am ready to submit to the law officer of the government all the tes-
timonials of my title, and the expositions of its merits, from the most
eminent legal minds of Country. These and the opinions of foreign
jurists, may be needed for counsel to the Executive on the question

whether, as authorized by the act of Congress referred to, the Execu-
tive ought to arrest any occupation or survey that, under the act, may
by designed, of the lands which I claim, until judicial action on my
rights may be had. That Executive measure I ask; while I now
record this my protest against any pretensions of the United States
to the lands I have thus claimed, and against any intrusion upon my
estate by occupation or survey under the government.”
Accompanying this protest, there is a letter addressed to you by
the Counsel of M* Hackley, in which they state that the only [support]
they then seek, is, “such a respectful regard for his claim, as shall in-
duce our government promptly to have his case submitted to judica-
ture, upon its actual and substantial merits—and freed from those
technical and vexatious embarrassments, which sometimes serve
merely to delay justice, and occasion reciprocal expense when between
individuals, although the ultimate justice eventually should triumph.”
They add: “but it being now intimated to him” (M* Hackley) “that
a survey of his lands has been contemplated (not so much by the power
that enacted the recent law, which expires in August next) as by the
interpretation given to it by those having its execution in the Land
Office he has been advised by his counsel to protest against the same-
and to no longer delay the full and petual establishment of his title—
in the which he confidently relies on the justice of his government, and
for reciprocal advantage to aid him.”
The acts which M. Hackley and his Counsel are anxious that the
President should perform are not very clearly indicated; but I infer
that he is obliquely requested to do these two things.
1. To issue his proclamation to suspend all further permits and
settlements under this act of Congress last.
2. To adopt some plan by which a case may be made between M'
Hackley and the United States, and submitted to Judicial decision.
Before the President could be advised to adopt either of these
measures it would be necessary to ascertain if the claim of M* Hackley
be so clear and irrefragible that the simple statement of it, would
demand Executive interference, as an act of justice.
I have not examined his title in a manner which warrants me in
pronouncing a definite opinion upon it; nor is it necessary that I
should; it is sufficient for me to say at this time, that the title is not
free from doubt. An examination of the 1* Vol of State papers,
will throw much light upon the history of the Treaty between the
United States and Spain. It appears that M. Ewing * our Minister
* George W. Erving.

to Spain wrote to M Adams, on the 10" of February 1818,” that the
King had lately made large grants of land in East Florida to several
of his favourites, and that he had been credibly informed, that by a
sweeping grant to the Duke of Alagon, he had within a few days past
given away the remainder.—1. Wol State papers 13.
It was the intention of M*Adams, as will appear by an examination
of his correspondence with Don Onis, to guard the government against
the effects of the sweeping grants made by the King of Spain. He
constantly urged that all grants lately made by Spain should be
cancelled; and he rejected the proposition of Don Onis that all grants
prior to the 24" of January 1818, should be absolutely confirmed—
yet it has been contended that all such are confirmed by the Treaty.
In this connexion, I beg leave to submit an extract from the opinion of
M” Justice Thompson in the case of the United States vs Arredondo
and others. 6. Peters at Page 755.
“The subsequent negotiation shows that the estate as it now stands,
was put into that shape expressly for the purpose of guarding against
such construction, and with the understanding, both of Don Onis and
M. Neville, who acted in his behalf during a part of the negotiation,
that the grants of land dated before as well as after the 24" of January
1818, were annulled, except those upon which settlements had been
commenced, the completion of which had been prevented by the
circumstances in Spain, and the recent revolutions in Europe . . .
There can be no doubt that such was the understanding of Don
Onis and M. Neville; and M Adams in a letter to our Minister in
Spain, whilst the treaty was pending before the King for ratification,
states that the reasons why the grants to the Duke of Alagon and
others were not excluded by name, were 1* conformably to the desire
of Mr Onis to save the honor of the King; and 2" because from the
despatches of M. Ewing, it was supposed there were other grants of
the same kind, and made under similar circumstances; To have
named them might have left room for a presumptive inference in
favor of others; the determination was to exclude them all.”
It may be inferred from the act of the 23" of May 1828.” entitled
“an act supplementary to the several acts providing for the settle-
ment and confirmation of private land claims in Florida,” that the
Legislative opinion was adverse to the validity of these grants. The
sixth section provides for the decision of claims containing a greater
quantity of land than could be decided under the provisions of pre-

vious acts, and it contains this proviso—“provided that nothing in
this section shall be construed to authorize said Judges to take con-
veyance of any claim, annulled by the said Treaty, or the decree rati-
fying the same by the King of Spain.” The grant to the Duke of
Alagon was one of three which the King intended to annul; whether
he effectually accomplished that design, is the important point in the
case, and in regard to which I abstain from giving an opinion.
Such being the case, I very respectfully suggest, that I do not de-
tect in it a sufficient reason for the issuing of a Proclamation, nor for
projecting any measure by which the rights of the United States shall
be judicially investigated. I should reluctantly recommend inaction
on the part of the President in regard to the latter point, if M Hackley
were precluded from an application to Congress for the relief to which
he may be entitled. I will retain the documents referred to me for
such order or disposition as you may please to make in reference to
them or the case to which they relate.
Having disposed of the matter particularly referred to me, I might
bring this extended communication to a close. But I avail myself of
the opportunity to make a suggestion in regard to the employment of
a Law Agent in Florida, and assistant counsel.
The 10" Sec of the act of the 23. of May 1828, authorized the
President to appoint a Law Agent to superintend the interests of the
United States in Florida. The 11. Sec provided that it should be
lawful for the President to employ assistant counsel, (in Florida) if
in his opinion the public interest required it, and to allow such coun-
sel, and the District Attorney such compensation as he might think
reasonable. The act of the 18" May 1842 * makes an appropriation
to the law Agent, assistant Counsel, and District Attorney, under
acts providing for settlement of private land claims in Florida, and
provides “that no allowance shall hereafter be made for compensation
to the law Agent, assistant Counsel, or extra fees to the District At-
torney of Florida for attending to the settlement of private land
claims in Florida, and the said Office of Law Agent, and power to
employ assistant counsel are hereby abolished.”
I have the honor to transmit an extract from a letter addressed to
me on the 10" Ult by Thomas Douglas Esq." U.S. Attorney for East
Florida," in which he adverts to the great importance, and the num-
ber of cases pending, in which the United States are interested, and
to the increased labour which has devolved upon him by a reference

back from the Supreme Court of ten cases for further proceedings.
For the reasons set forth by M. Douglas, it is worthy of consideration
whether it be not expedient that Congress should not confer upon the
President authority to make the District Attorney a suitable compen-
sation for services rendered in the settlement of private land claims.
I also transmit a copy of a letter addressed to me on the 12" Ult
by William P. Duval Esq. Law Agent * in the Florida claims in
which he states the character of the duties which must be performed
for the next two years in regard to these claims. Considering the
vast amount of land covered by the claims of M" Hackley and others,
the difficulties which will probably arise in carrying out the act of
Congress of the 4” of August last and the minute knowledge which
Gov: Duval has of the Territory, and of the history of outstanding
claims, I feel it my duty to suggest whether the reestablishment of
the office of Law Agent for these claims is not required by the true
interests of the United States.”

SIR. Herewith transmitted is a copy of a letter addressed to this
Office by the Delegate from the Territory of Florida, dated 15" inst,"
with a copy of my reply thereto of this date," on the subject of the
removal of the Office of the Surveyor General of Florida from Talla-
hassee to St Augustine.
The seventh section of the Act of 3" March 1823” referred to in
my reply, will, it is believed, justify the proposed removal, provided
the necessity & propriety of the measure should be urged by proper
representations to the Executive from Citizens of the Territory.
The subject is now before you & through your instrumentality &
that of the Delegate, the attention of the Citizens of the Territory

SIR. I have the honor of submitting herewith, a copy of the report
& survey of Captain C Graham of the mouth of the Suwanee, Florida
and also of his estimate for emproving the entrance to that River,"
called for by a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 14
instant."
The same resolution also calls for an estimate for the survey of a
route for a Rail Road to connect the waters of the S" Johns with those
of the Swannee. In illustration of this part of the resolution I have
had copied from a map, that portion of the territory of Florida, which
would probably be traversed by the proposed road.
The shortest route for a Rail Road between the S" Johns & the
Suwannee, would propably be between Pelatka on the former River
and Fort Fanning on the latter, and it would I think not deviate much
from a direct line between these two places. If the entrance of the
Swannee were improved, as proposed by Captain Graham that river
would be navigable from the Gulf of Mexico for many miles above
Fort Fanning, and Pelatka is now of easy access from the Atlantic
It is beleived that a Rail road could be constructed between the

places above named, that need not exceed 80 miles in length. But
as it is important that the best line should be selected, and as this
cannot be done without the survey of several trial lines, it will be
perceived that the expence of the survey will involve more than that of
the mere line which the road may occupy. Also Sir such surveys lead
invariably to demands for estimate of cost, which last cannot be made
without the collection of numerous details The wages of hired men,
means of subsistence and of transport are also high there. Moreover
the requisite instruments in double setts as there is no getting In-
struments repaired in that country, will have to be sent from the
Bureau; and the officers of the party, after having completed their
field operations will have to return to the Bureau in order to make
out the customary reports drawings & estimates, as there is no nearer
place at which all the facilities for these duties are to be found.
These considerations constitute the contingencies of such work and
enfluence the ultimate expence; and oblige me to say that a less sum
than 5000 dollars would propably be found inadequate to the expences
of the survey*

To THE HON” DAVID LEVY Delegate in Congress from Florida.
SIR: From recent information received by the undersigned
they are apprehensive that the Government may be advised to
abolish the office of Keeper of the Public Archieves at Saint Augus-
tine and to remove the documents from that place, hence they deem
it their duty to address you urging that you use diligence to represent
these measures which—if carried to effect, must necessarily produce,
the greatest confusion and the most ruinous consequences.
Among these Archieves (which are voluminous) are contained
the evidence of the grants of land in East Florida from the Spanish
Government; and in settling the rights under these grants constant

route between the St. Johns and the Suwannee, and advising that an estimate was
supplied at the last session of Congress for a survey for a railroad, but no appro-
priation was made.

reference is obliged to be made to them, copies of papers certified
under the hand of an officer capable of giving them correctly are
frequently necessary, and translations of the same into English are
requisite to be made by an officer learned in the languages who can
render the same with perfection & dispatch. There could be no
more fortunate arrangement of this office than exists at present.
It is near one of the Land-Offices, it is in a central position to the
granted lands of which it only contains the record and is in the midst
of the people by whom it is exclusively consulted. The papers
are of the utmost value and importance as containing the titles by
which all lands are held in East-Florida—other than those lands
held by immediate purchase from the United States,—and these
papers require the care and direction of a person who has long become
familiar with them.
If a removal of the Archieves be contemplated to be made to
Tallahassee, the undersigned fully concur with each other in the
opinion that they could not be in a place more inconvenient if removed
to Washington—so little is the intercourse and so difficult is the
communication, between Tallahassee and East-Florida; and they
regard even a removal as a matter of serious moment in view of
possible injuries & loss.

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF EAST
FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 27 Cong., 3 sess.:DS]
[January 23, 1843]
To The Honorable, the House of Representatives of the United States,
$n Congress assembled.
The undersigned, inhabitants of East Florida, having been informed
that the Chairman of your Committee of Ways and Means, has
addressed a Letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, enquiring whether
the papers in the office of Public Archives in S" Augustine, cannot
be transferred to the keeping of the Secretary of the Territory at
Tallahassee, Respectfully represent: That these papers are the
local records of East Florida; and the exclusive property thereof.
They are (according to the Inventory) contained in four hundred and
eighty eight bundles, in which are sixty nine thousand, eight hundred,
and eighty documents, mostly written in the Spanish language,
some of said documents being made up of various instruments of
writing, to the amount of half a quire of paper. They comprise,
Wills, testmentary proceedings, Settlements of Estates, Naturali-
zation papers, proceedings at law, Bills of Sale of personal property,
Deeds, Petitions to the Spanish Governors for Grants of Land,
and proceedings connected with such Grants, with plots and surveys
of the same, and all things concerning the rights of property, in
East Florida, previous to the cession, to the United States: For
which reason a referrence to them as evidence is necessary at every
term of Court, and in private transfers of property; the more parti-
cularly at this time, when surveys are progressing, and the Country
is thrown open for settlement; since they are the original Records of
all private Grants of land. They relate to no property West of the
River Suwannee, and are not required at Tallahassee, where they
might be deranged or lost; while their removal would be oppressive
and unjust to the inhabitants of this District, whose property they
are; as the delays, inconveniences, and expense, of constant referrence
to that distant place, would be most onerous. The act of removal,
would be equivalent to transferring the Records of any County,
to the Secretary of State at a distance Capital. Wherefore the
undersigned, for themselves, and in behalf of their fellow citizens
in East Florida, respectfully protest against a removal of these archives,
which should forever remain here, for the Security of the rights of
property; and we pray your Honorable House, to disapprove any
motion that may be made in Congress, in opposition to the wishes
herein expressed.
S‘Augustine, EAST FLORIDA, 23" January, 1843.

JUDGE BRONSON TO DELEGATE LEVY
[NA: HF, 27 Cong., 3 sess.: ALS]
TALLAHASSEE Fl" Jany 25 1843.
MY DEAR SIR Your letter of the [Blank] inst * is before me—
The project of discontinueing the office of the Keeper of public Ar-
chives at St Augustine and removing the records & papers of that
office to this place, is one which would be exceedingly deterimental to
the people of East Florida—injurious to their interests & productive of
great evil and trouble—You are well aware that the records of that
office relate principally to the lands of East Florida & in fact to those
of the Eastern part of that Dist;—and also to other interests of the
people of that District—They alone & those claiming under them
have any concern with those records, except the Government of the
U.S. and when wanted for Government purposes or by the officers of
Gov" they are wanted there—The people of this District have nothing
to do with them—no interest in them;—& the proposition to remove
our County Records of St Johns County to Tallahassee would not be
a whit more absurd or indefensible upon every just principle—Be-
sides if those records are to be removed from the place where they be-
long and from among the people whose records they are, they might
better be taken to Washington or any of the Atlantic cities—Where the
Citizens of East Florida could have ready access to them—It is not
hazarding too much to say that most of the people of East Florida par-
ticularly those living on the Atlantic Coast could get to them or procure
copies of them more easily & cheaply & with more facility from
Washington than they could from Tallahassee If it is desireable that
they should be in the Office of the Surveyor Gen' let that be removed
to St Augustine;—That would be a much more rational proposition—
Let “Mahomet go to the Mountain” rather than attemp to bring the
Mountain to him—There is not a term of my Court at St Augustine
that some of these records are not required particularly in all land
cases—.Ihave had frequent occasion also to consult them in reference to
the claims for losses of 1812 & 13—they are constantly referred to by
the people on the subject of land titles, perhaps nearly as much as the
Co: records—You are aware of course that they relate to various
other matters besides land titles—and to a period in the history of the
province too, when East Florida consisted principally of St Augustine
and the Country along the Eastern Coast—
The time may come by and by when they might perhaps be prop-
erly transferred to the Land Office of the Dist or the County Clerks
office of St Johns County, but that time is not yet—The lands of the
District are now being surveyed—and we hope will be settled,—the

private grants which are dotted all over the Dist will now come in req-
uisition & their owners will endeavour to sell them and questions are
now and will constantly, for some time to come, be arising about the
location & boundaries, which will make a reference to these records
necessary—They are all in the Spanish Language and if transferred
to another office they would in effect be a sealed Book, to most of those
who desired to consult them, unless a good Spanish clerk was employed
in the office to take charge of them and certainly such an one who is
competent for the task could not be found for less than the present
salary of the keeper—
In no point of view therefor can I see that the public interests would
be subserved by the proposed change—on the contrary it is forbidden
by every argument of sound policy or expediency"—

[NA:ND, SN Live Oak Lets.:LS]
JACKSONVILLE E F Jan 30th 1843
SIR On my return from the interior, some two or three hundred
miles up the river St Johns, I received Yours of the 31* of Dec,”
and am not at all surprised at the information received by You, of
complaints to the department of the unnecessary annoyance I give
to the people, but I will assure You that these complaints do not
come from the majority of the inhabitants of Florida; I will con-
vince You at some future day that gentlemen of high standing, who
own large tracts of land justly and honorably, are desirous to have a
check put upon those speculators who are cutting timber of different
descriptions upon public land, as it is spoiling the market for their
own—But I will send You a book of the confirmation of grants, by
which You will perceive, what description of persons are sending in
these serious complaints—I will here state that I have not yet ob-
tained quite all, and of course the book is partially imperfect as there
have been so many differents clerks in the Superior Court for the last
twenty years: and what I have obtained has been attended with much
vexation and labor. but little expense.—I have been above lake
Harney, and find that there is a great deal of valuable timber border-
ing upon the different lakes and inlets, which has not yet been dis-
turbed, by the setler, but wherever there is any valuable timber dis-
covered, there are persons who bring forward large Spanish grants
from twenty to forty thousand odd acres to cover all such lands.—
Those grants are principally confirmed and purport to have been
surveyed under different dates, Some up as late as 1821, but where I
have examined up in that section of the country, I cannot find the
mark of an axe, or any sign to show that a surveyor has ever been
upon the ground. And the locations are variously called for, from
twenty miles from St Augustine, forty miles from some other place,
bordering on some long pond, or cornering upon some cabbage tree,
and Florida abounds in both, but the holders of these grants never
fail whenever they find a tract containing timber, to sell and say that
their grant covers it.—I would suggest that unless there should be
some way devised by the department, or some act of congress, com-
pelling holders of these grants, to have them located and surveyed,
within some reasonable time, but in all cases compelling this fulfil-
ment, before they are permitted to take posession of the lands, and
sell the timber therefrom, the country will always be in a state of con-
fusion, and no man can buy lands from the government in safety.
As they will be liable every day to be covered with thes manufactured

grants.—I find in some instances a man thinks nothing of skipping
some eight or ten miles, and we may say fifty for the purpose of get-
ting such land as suits his views. and in some cases where there has
been an order from the court for some six or eight thousand acres to
be surveyed, and the starting point named in the order, and it is as-
certained that by going by the true point of the compass according to
the decision of the court, it does not comprise such lands as they wish
to be included within their lines, they have varied to my certain
knowledge from forty to fifty degrees. from the designated line to
accomplish their object,—When I interfere to prevent such altera-
tions, and save the land and timber which belongs to the general
government, this is their complaints of unnecessary annoyance—But
I have pleasure in stating that I have succeeded to a great extent in
checking their progress, and I will insure You that I shall live up to
the letter of my instructions as far as my ability will permit—I will
ask if I shall consider Yellow pine and Cypress to be included in the
description of Ship timber, as there are large quantities of the former
shipped every day from Florida for planking and decking merchant
vessels, as it is esteemed superior to that of the same growth in any
other section of the country and I should suppose it would be more
suitable than any other kind of pine for the gun decks of our Ships
of war.—My surveyor has arrived and I shall start immediately for
Mosquito to look after those chimney corner or floating surveys in
the vicinity of Indian River—I have not the least doubt that every
foot of land where Palmer & Ferris are now cutting Live oak, belongs
to the general government.—Concerning affairs at Mosquito, I will
for Your information enclose the copy of a letter from Mr Walker col-
lector of customs at St Augustine,” and beg to recommend the same
for Your consideration.—I will here state that I consider Mr Douglass”

instance, and interest, in connection with his friends, in a tract to the
amount of Sixteen thousand acres,—The claim that I refer to will be

I should be “hale fellow well met” but I mean to report the facts as
near as I can get at them let the consequences be what they may.
I will draw. Your attention to the notice of the Surveyor general
requesting all those who have private land claims, to bring them
forward by the 15" of march next, to enable him to designate the
same from government lands.—I beg to be permitted to make a few
remarks, and give You my opinion upon that subject—I am so well
acquainted with the situation of those grants. I am convinced that
very little attention will be paid to the notice by holders, with very
few exceptions, as they are so well aware that their grants cannot be
located as set forth in the book of confirmations, and permit me to
suggest to You the propriety of reccommending to Congress that a
law be passed to appropriate a certain sum of money for the purpose
of locating and surveying those private grants. All those that should
be brought forward in [Blank] Years, to be done at the expense of
the government, and after that period the holders should bear their
own expense—and likewise it should be made some offence as may
be deemed most advisable, for any man to take possession of or
remove timber from lands before he shall have them located and
surveyed according to the call of the grant and its confirmation.
for unless there is some act of that kind the grantees will not bring
forward their claim, and the country will always be unsettled—
And it not to be expected that those who have taken the government
contract at $4 per mile can take sufficient pains and precaution and
justice to the government, if he has to locate and survey those grants
within his contract price, for You will see the difficulty he will have to
encounter by perusing the book of confirmations, and it will be his
interest of course to survey out the grant of an individual whereever
he may say it lays, without the trouble and expense of hunting out
the true boundaries,—I am convinced that no man can pay his ex-
penses by surveying that part of Florida which is now offered to be
given out in contracts at $4 per mile, and of course whoever contracts
for the same must fail—
I enclose to You a Bond which I have taken from Mr Boushell,”
concerning Timber which he has purchased of Maj Taylor and other
settlers bordering upon Lake Monroe–It is proper for me to state,
that he has agreed to pay Maj Taylor twelve and a half cts per cubic
foot for timber standing, and ten cents for timber purchased of others”

RESOLUTION BY THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY
[NA:HF, 27 Cong., 3 sess.:C]
[February 2, 1843]
Whereas the people of this Territory, though not Members of any
of the states of the Union, are yet citizens of the United States and,
entitled, so far as their position will allow, to all the rights and privi-
leges of freemen.
And whereas it is against the spirit of the American Institutions,
as plainly declared in the Constitution of the United States and ante
republican, that the highest and most important officers of the Ter-
ritorial Government, their Governors and Judges, as has been fre-
quently the case, should be selected by, and these offices filled by
strangers, unacquainted with the character, laws, habits customs and
institutions of the people whose dearest interest are entrusted to
their charge.
And whereas the excuse for such appointment in the early existence
of the Territory, on account of the sparceness of the population and
the difficulities of finding suitable persons therein, no longer exists
and persons fully competent to perform the important duties per-
taining to said offices to the satisfation of the people can be found
among the citizens of this Territory as experience has clearly
demonstrated,
Resolved therefore, that the Congress of the United States be and
it is hereby earnestly invoked to amend and alter the organic law,
so far as to permit the Choice and election by the people and Legis-
lature of this Territory, of the Governor Judges and such other officers
as they may deem most expedient.

DEAR SIR, At the request of my Father, I transmit you a certified
copy of a Preamble & Resolution of the Legislative Council, in re-
lation to his claim against the Govm'—
I have also sent copies to the chairmen of the respective Committees
on claims, in the two Houses of Congress.
An error, I think, was committed by the member who drew the
Peramble, in fixing the amount of the verdict at $18.058—As well
as my recollection serves, it should have been $18.250. I presume,
however, the mistake is a matter of no consequence, as the Committees
in Congress, before whom the claim now is, will be governed by the
Record.
Hoping that the expression of feeling on the part of our Legislature,
contained in the Preamble & Resolution, may have a beneficial
effect, and that with your assistance, the claim may be favorably
reported upon, at the present session of Congress.

upon the General Government, ask leave to report the same amended,
as follows;
Whereas a verdict was rendered in the District Court of the United
States, held at Tallahassee, at their April Term 1840, in a suit lately
pending therein, instituted by the said United States against W P.
DuVal in favor of said DuVal for the sum of Eighteen thousand &
fifty eight Dollars, being found due to him by the Jury for services
rendered as Superintendant of Indian Affairs in Florida, from 1822
to 1834, and for advances of money made by him during the twelve
years of his superintendance, and for expenses incurred in supplying
the Indians with provisions:
And whereas, this Legislative Council, in common with the people
of Florida, appreciating the services so rendered by the said DuVal,
as one of the first Governors of the Territory, and in recollection of
the sacrafices made and losses sustained by him, feel an anxious
desire that justice should be done him in the premises, and that his
claim shall be no longer delayed.
Be it therefore Resolved, by the Governor and Legislative Council,
that the early attention of the Congress of the United States be
earnestly invoked to this subject, and that our Delegate be requested
to use his exertions, to procure from Congress the speedy adjustment
and settlement of said claim.
Resolved, also, that a copy of this Resolution be furnished our
Delegate, to be laid before Congress.”

APALACHICOLA 17* February 1843
DEAR SIR Your communication of the 14* December last”
was forwarded from this place to me at Tallahassee during the session
of the Court of Appeals. I have obtained from the clerks in the
diferent counties in which courts are held in the Apalachicola District
the number of cases which have been disposed of and which are
yet pending under the bankrupt law. The result of that information
is as follows
Twenty persons have been discharged and Eighteen applications
for discharge are still pending
In all the above cases the applications were made by the bank-
rupts themselves—none on the part of creditors.
There has been but one case in which the discharge was opposed,
and in no case has it been refused.
As congress has probably ere this repealed the bankrupt law
it is perhaps unnecessary for me to reply to the balance of your
communication. I will however remark that I know of no modifi-
cation of the law which I think would be useful. Its effects, in
this District, have been to restore to business and active employment
a number of useful and enterprising men who, until their discharge,
were in a state of hopeless indebtedness. I know of no evils which
have resulted from the operation of the law
I am respectfully your obdt sevt.

and for other purposes”,” it is made “the duty of the Secretary of
each Territory, to prepare the Acts passed by the Legislature, for
publication, and to furnish a Copy thereof, to the public printer of
the Territory, within ten days after the passage of each Act.”
Beleiving that I will not be able to perform the labor imposed
upon me by the above recited Act, during the present Session of
our Legislature, and fearing that some blame may attach to me
for a Seeming neglect of my duty, I beg leave to make the following
explanation, in order that you may understand the difficulty in
which I am placed.
By a Resolution of the Legislature, passed in Feb’y 1841, the
Hon” W* Marvin, Judge of the Southern Judicial District, was
appointed to revise the laws of this Territory—This task has been
Completed, and he has submitted to our present Legislative Council,
a Revised Code, which is now being adopted with, I beleive, but
few amendments.
In addition, therefore, to the ordinary legislation of the Council,
there will be this Revised Code of Judge Marvin's, forming, as I
understand it will, when printed, a volume of Six or Seven hundred
pages; the whole of which, by the Act of Congress referred to, it
is made my duty to furnish a Copy of, in a very limited time, to
the public printer of the Territory. The greater portion of this
work must be performed, too, during the Session of the Legislature,
when the ordinary duties of my office, of themselves, keep me almost
constantly engaged.
Was there nothing more than the ordinary legislation of the Council,
I could accomplish the labor, in the time specified by the Act of
Congress.
I trust, Sir, that the above Statement of facts will exonerate me
from any blame if the laws of the Territory, passed at the present
Session of the Legislature, should not be published and distributed
as early as usual. My inability, to perform the duty imposed upon
my by the Act of Congress, within the time limited, will not prevent
me, however, from doing so in as short a time, as the magnitude
of the task, and the necessity of my other duties, will permit."

on account of expenses of Courts of the U. S. &c, and on the same day
a letter was written to him stating that the cause of the delay in re-

of his transmitting further accounts and vouchers of his expenditures

it was deemed that the public interest required, and the state of his

course is such that we have come to the conclusion to abandon our
contracts with you, unless you should see fit to arrest his malicious
and uncalled for inteferance with our duties as Contractors.—we have
submitted to his acts of oppression (which he has predicated on Your
authority,) until we can bear it no longer, and in justice to ourselves
must take this course to avoid the ruinous consequences attending our
fulfilment of the engagements to your Depmt; while subject to the
whims & caprices of Mr. Thistle.—We were in hopes that we should
have no further trouble with him, as we had this winter carried on our
operations in a Section of the Country where there is little, or no
public Land, and as our timber had been cut and purchased from
confirmed Spanish Grants where the owners had actually been in
possession for Years.—
The timber thus cut (at an unusually heavy expense) has been
shipped to fulfil our contract at the Norfolk Navy Yard, & would
have been on its way there, but for its detention by Mr. Thistle, who
persists in detaining the vessel until he has ascertained by actual
Survey of a large portion of the country whether the timber was cut
on public land or not—
All that he has to warrant the detention is his own vague suspicions,
which are groundless, as the country where we have cut is covered
for Seventeen, or Eighteen miles with numerous confirmed Grants
whose boundaries actually call for each others lines, without leaving
a single particle of public Land between them; and again, he was
notified by us early in the fall that we intended cutting here, & re-
quested to make what examinations he deemed necessary, so as not
to give us any detention with our timber when it was ready for ship-
ping.—That this detention is malicious, there remains not the least
question of doubt, as the most respectable and undoubted proof can
be adduced that he made the assertion “that he would seize the timber
whether it was cut on public land or not.”—
We would Sir appeal to your generossity & justice, to know whether
we are to submit to this uncalled for oppression or not; We have
already sustained heavy losses enough through Mr. Thistles' mallice
& injustice, and are determined to suffer no more;—His most uncalled
for acts of oppression & userpation of power are predicated upon
Official authority, & even his acts of the most illegal character he
avers. receives Your sanction.—You are certainly aware Sir, that we
do not stand alone in making these complaints; other charges emanat-
ing from the most respectable authority, & substanciated by the most
abundant proof have been preferred against him, & at this moment
lie in the Archives of the Govmt.

By a former Regulation of Your Depmt. where disputes arose in

unsurveyed are within the said District.
Your petitioners would further represent that to Substantiate the
private claims to Lands in East Florida, in the manner required by
order of the Commissioners of the General Land office as published
by The Surveyor General, much inconvenience, and great Expense
would be incurred by the owners thereof in consequence of the re-
mote residence of the Surveyor General.
Therefore your petitioners pray that the Office of the Surveyor
General of the United States for the Territory of Florida, may be
removed to the District of East Florida."

interest in a national and local point of view that I have thought
you would not deem the suggestion and request I am about to make
unworthy the attention of the Department. There is no doubt that
if the ravages of this insect can be arrested, the peninsula of Florida
is capable of furnishing completely the market of the whole Union
with the orange, lemon, & lime. The insect is of the coccus family,
very minute, and covers the bark leaves & fruit, exhausting the tree
of its juices, & destroying it to the root. Whole groves have been
SWept.
It is understood that a similar insect once appeared in the Groves
of the South of Europe, and my desire is that you would do us the
favor to address a circular to the consuls and diplomatic agents at
all the European posts where the orange is cultivated for the purpose
of ascertaining an accurate history of this plague, and of obtaining

[March 15, 1843]
Whereas, it hath been made known to this Legislative Council, by
petition of the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Apalachicola,”
that they have petitioned Congress for an appropriation to deepen
the Straight Channel in the Bay of Apalachicola, whereby vessels of
greater burden can be brought to the wharf of said city—And
whereas, the growing and commercial importance of the said city of
Apalachicola, enables her to ask with great justice for the efficient

aid of the General Government, in order to develope more surely
and speedily her great resources and commercial advantages—And
whereas, the exports and imports from and to the said Bay of
Apalachicola, are continually and surely increasing—And whereas,
her commerce is greatly embarassed in consequence of the filling
up of the channel aforesaid–And it is believed that a compari-
tively small appropriation would effectually remove the cause of
embarassment—
Be it therefore resolved, That the Legislative Council most respect-
fully memorialize Congress that this prayer of the said petitioners, to
wit; the petition of the Chamber of Commerce of the city of Apalachi-
cola, may be granted—and the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars
be appropriated by Congress, from the Treasury of the United States,
for the deepening and widening of the Straight Channel in the Bay of
Apalachicola, to be expended under such appointment and superin-
tendance as Congress may direct—and that a copy of this preamble
and resolution be forwarded to the Secretary of the Treasury, and to
our Delegate in Congress, respectfully requesting him to lay the same
before Congress, and to use his influence and exertion to have said
appropriation made—

Permits, under the Armed Occupation Act “by persons who have
not been on the lands described in their Notices.”*—
You express your “conviction that many abuses might arise from
granting Permits in Such cases”—State that you have “refused to
issue them,” until you “can receive the directions of the Department
on the Subject,”—and that it has appeared to you “that the Bonafide
Settler who has gone into the wilderness, and is there making a loca-
tion, may from the difficulty of Communicating with the Office,
be deprived of his rights, or unfairly speculated on; should others be
allowed to obtain Permits without personally Selecting the lands
they apply for”. &c
It is necessary for you to interpose every proper means to guard
against, and prevent the abuses which you apprehend, or any others
likely to occur in operations under the Act, and by a faithful and
rigid execution of your duties, to protect the rights of all bonafide
Applicants.
The Construction given by you however has excited, as I am ad-
vised much dissatisfaction, and produced inconvenience to Emi-
grants—
I have therefore in regard to this matter carefully looked into the
Act, the 1* Stipulation of which is to this effect. “That Said settler
shall obtain from the Register of the Land Office, in the District in
which he proposes to Settle, a permit describing, as particularly as
may be practicable, the place where his or her Settlement is intended
to be made”: &c.
Neither this provision of the law, nor any other Section of it, appears
to render it indispensably pre requisite to the obtaining of a permit,
that the Applicant himself should in the first instance actually go
upon the land he desires to Settle—I see no objection to the granting
of a permit, when a Bona fide Applicant can so far Satisfy himself
as regards the Situation &c. of the land he proposes to Settle, as to
enable him to file the requisite Notice Accompanied by,
1" The Applicants own Affidavit shewing whether he is “the head
of a family,” or “a single man over eighteen years of age, able to bear
Arms,” and the period when he became a resident of Florida
2" by evidence, in cases where he became a resident of Florida
on the 4” Aug 1842 [the date of the Act].” that he is not the owner,
of 160 Acres of land at the time he proposes to Settle.

Knowledge can make the following Oath. “I aver that the settle-
ment herein intended is not ‘within two miles of any permanent

A Notice thus Supported, will be a Substantial compliance with the

the Affidavit of the Applicant himself—

may wish to come within its purview.”—

[FSL: Govr. Exec. Let. Bk.: M30]
Office of the Secretary TALLAHASSEE March 18th 1843
To/ THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY of the United States
SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith, an Abstract of the mem-
bers of the Legislative council of this Territory, shewing the amount
of their pay and mileage, and containing their receipts for the same,
for the session commencing on the 2" January 1843, and ending on
the 16th inst.” In a few days, I will transmit a list of the Officers,
and others employed in the service of the Legislature, together with
the receipts for their certificates to be furnished by me.
I beg leave to call your attention to the enclosed copy of a com-
munication addressed by me to the Speaker of the Ho. of Rep. of this
Territory,” asking for certain information in regard to the Hon:
Jno M. Palmer, the member from Hillsborough Co, and also to that
of the Secretary of the House, written in reply thereto, under a Res-
olution adopted by the House. Beleiving that I could not, without
a violation of my duty, furnish to M Palmer a certificate for com-
pensation as a member of the House, in case he should apply for one,
I thought it best to obtain from the House itself, the facts in relation
to his absence, and lay them before you. In addition to the infor-
mation contained in the letter of the Sec'y of the House, I deem it
my duty to state that Mr Palmer holds the Office of Inspector of the
Customs at Tampa Bay, and the necessity for his attention to the
duties of that Office was, most probably, the cause of his early and
continued absence from the Legislature. M. Palmer has not, as
yet, applied to me for his certificate. Should he do so, I shall with-
hold it, until advised by you, whether or not it is proper that it should
be given to him—Upon this point, I beg leave to ask for instructions
at as early a date as your convenience will permit.”

Inspectors, with fixed salaries, one to be stationed at Musquito inlet,
the other at Indian river or Hillsborough inlet, within this District;
yet I am so well persuaded, that if one at least of these measures is not
resorted to, the Government must be defrauded, that I feel bound to
renew my application.—
This District from, without including, the mouth of the river St:
Johns, to and including the outlet of Indian river offers an extent of
coast of upwards of two hundred miles, the country bordering on which
is rapidly settling, both from the inducements held out by the Govern-
ment and the cessation of Indian hostilities. Five rivers, the North,
Matanzas, Halifax, Hillsborough and Indian Rivers, all navigable by
vessels drawing from six to sixteen feet of water, run in a direction
parallel with the coast, along this whole distance, at no point more
than three and at some half and even a quarter of a mile from the
beach; forming four different inlets: St Augustine, this port, Matanzas
inlet; eighteen miles south, seven to nine feet deep, Musquito inlet,
seventy miles south of this place, ten to thirteen feet deep, and lastly
Indian river, otherwise called Hillsborough inlet, some two hundred
miles south, navigable also by vessels of light draught of water, when
these facilities together with the vicinity of the Island of Cuba and
the English Bahamas are well considered, it is not without good reason,
I fear, that I apprehend attempts may be made to defraud the revenue,
attempts which could scarcely be known, and if known, with still
more difficulty resisted, by a single Inspector, paid only when em-
ployed, stationed at this port, and myself the only revenue officer in
so extensive and exposed a District.—This I can not better illustrate
than by pointing to a vessel “the Nimrod” a brig of 19740/95 tons,
which had for nearly a whole month been at Musquito inlet loading
with live oak, before I became aware of her arrival; as soon as pos-
sessed of the information, I had ascertained, through the live oak
agent, that the Brig was loaded, if not entirely, at least almost so,
with live oak, cut from lands belonging to the United States, I caused
her after considerable difficulty, to be seized on the 3" instant; but
from my absolute want of means it has been impossible, both to
myself and the United States Marshal, to remove the vessel to this
place, though both the Collectors of St: Mary's and Savannah
have been applied to for the aid of the revenue vessels under their
control.—Yet Musquito Inlet is comparatively close to St: Augustine,
had anything occurred at Indian river it must have been all but im-
possible to have effected anything. I would therefore most respect-
fully suggest that this District be furnished with a revenue cutter,
should this, I beleive, allow me to say the best plan not be followed,
then that I be furnished with, or authorized to purchase a boat

of sufficient burthen to go to sea when necessary, say from ten to
fifteen tons, that I have also power to employ permanently two men
and one boy with additional men when requisite, to man her, allowing
on of the men sufficient pay to insure trustworthiness and some
knowledge of navigation, to whom the powers of an Inspector might
also be given.—At present either of these plans would suffice; other-
wise I should be permitted to employ two additional permanent
Inspectors, with fixed salaries & the use of a row boat, one as already
stated to be stationed at Musquito Inlet the other at Indian river.
I hope that I may be excused for taking up so much of your valuable
time, but I would have failed in what I conceived to be my duty, had
I not laid before you, Sir, facts which, I think, call loudly for an early
consideration.—

referred to in these Several Communications, and the great public
interests involved, have induced me to transmit the accompanying
papers, with the assent of the President, for the purpose of inviting
the attention of the Committee on public lands to the questions Con-
nected with them.”—
This Communication was taken up and examined by the Committee
who reported a bill making the necessary appropriations, and unani-
mously, I am informed urged upon the House the importance & neces-
sity of its passage *—And no doubt was entertained of its passage
could it have been reached on the Calender—but that not being the
case, it sleeps among the unfinished business of the Session.
Fearing this result, the precaution was taken some ten days before
the adjournment, at the suggestion one of the Committee of the
House to Call the attention of the Committee of the Senate also to the
Subject—but for the Same Cause no action could in that body—
And now Congress having adjourned without making provision to
pay Counsel to represent them what is to be done? The Continuance
of your attention and Services in these Cases is deemed of very great
importance to the interests of the United States yet there is no fund
out of which the Department Can Compensate you. I have con-
ferred fully and freely on the Subject with your Delegate in Congress,
and the conclusion we arrived at was, that I should Communicate
to you what had been done in the premises, and submit to you whether
under the Circumstances you should not continue to give your Ser-
vices to the Government in these Cases, relying on Congress at their
next Session to make provision to pay you. I have no authority
in the premises and can hold out no promise of Compensation—All
that I can Say is that I deem your Services of great importance to
the Government—And that I believe Congress will at the next Session
provide a reasonable Compensation for those Services. In this
opinion your Delegate as he will inform you Concurs—If in view of
these Circumstances and upon this reliance for Compensation you
can consistently with a proper regard for your private interests,
Continue your attention to these Cases I shall be greatly gratified
Please advise me of your determination in the matter at your earliest
Conveniance.”

SIR, I have to inform you, that the amounts submitted in your
late estimates, for your own salary, & for Clerks in your Office, as
follows:
For the half year ending 30" June 1843.
For your own salary $1,000.
For Clerks in your Office 1,500 2,500
For the fiscal year ending 30" June 1844

Total $7,500
have been provided in the Appropriation Acts of 24" Dec. last & 3"
March inst.
In making your disbursements under the above appropriations,
I have to request, that you will observe the most rigid economy and
restrict the expenditures as much within your own estimates, as may
be consistent with the public interest, in order that any part of the
balance remaining, which may not be wanted, when the next estimates
for new appropriations are submitted to Congress, may be either be
carried forward for the Service of the ensuing fiscal year, or be turned
over to the Surplus fund, whichever may be deemed most expedient
at the time.
The general appropriation for surveying includes an amount
available for the fiscal year commencing 1" July next, intended for
the extension of the surveys in the “armed occupation district”
Florida, & it has already been recommended, in a communication
from the Hon. D. Levy to this Office, to have surveyed all the lands
included between the Indian river or sea cost, & the townships ordered
to be surveyed last fall on the River St Johns;—no further action
will be taken however, until the plats of at least a portion of the
townships already under Contract for subdivision shall be returned
to this Office.*
In the mean time I will thank you to use the most vigorous efforts
to return as many of the plats of new surveys as possible by the 1"
of July next, in order that the lands not located therein by settlers,
may then be advertised for sale. You will likewise please report to
this Office as early as convenient after the receipt hereof, on the

GENTLEMEN By the 6* Section of the Act of Congress, known
as the Armed Occupation Act, approved the 4" August 1842, en-
titled An Act “To provide for the Armed occupation and settlement
of the unsettled part of the peninsula of East Florida,” it is provided
“That not exceeding two hundred thousand Acres of land shall be
taken for settlement under this Act.”
It therefore become necessary that precautionary measures should
be taken to prevent Permits being issued for more then the quantity
authorized to be taken by law.
To secure this object you are therefore hereby directed
To report to each other and to this Office from time to time, and
as often as you may deem necessary (at least once a month) the
aggregate quantity of acres taken up at your respective Offices
under the Act from the Commencement of Operations up to the
dates of your reports
When you find from the reports of each other that the whole
quantity Authorized to be located is likely to be taken up, or has
Actually been covered by Permits, your Operations must forthwith
cease under the law.
I shall rely upon your vigilance and promptitude to prevent the
possibility of Permits being issued for any excess whatever over
the quantity of 200.000 Acres authorized to be located under the
Aforesaid Act.”

PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT BY RESIDENTS OF ST.
JOHNS COUNTY
[NA:GLO, Lets. from SG, Fla.: DS "I
[March, 1843]
To His Excellency, John Tyler, President of the U States,
The undersigned, residents of the County of St. Johns in the
Territory of Florida, beg leave to represent to your Excellency,
that the Surveyor General of this Territory has heretofore resided
in Middle Florida; that this location was selected before the lands
in Middle Florida were surveyed; that the unsurveyed lands are
now mainly, if not wholly, in East Florida; that the numerous grants,
made to the old Spanish inhabitants, lie here also; that many of
them are within the district now being, or soon to be, surveyed;
that the public Archives, in which are deposited the original grants
and plats of survey, are kept in St. Augustine, & that the United
States surveys can not be properly made without frequent references
to the Archives for these grants & plats; that the proprietors of
these grants, though often of limited means, are subject to much
inconvenience & useless expense, without being able to have their
lands surveyed from the impracticability of seeing the Surveyor
General or finding his deputies, while making the Surveys; that,
in former surveys, many confirmed grants have been run out as
public land, & other irregularities have arisen, which must occasion
great inconvenience & injury to the poorer claimants, and result
only in expensive, litigation. The undersigned believe the above
evils & other inconveniences would be averted by the residence
of the Surveyor General in St. Augustine, or some other part of
East Florida, & that the interests of the United States would be
promoted by preventing irregularities & setting the boundaries of
these numerous private claims. They therefore beg leave most re-
spectfully to suggest to your Excellency the propriety of establishing
the office of the Surveyor General at St. Augustine, thereby advancing
the interests of the United States no less than those of the citizens
of East Florida, in which the unsurveyed lands lie.”

In respect to the supplying of Key West, the General is of opinion
that it is best for a time that the Steamer Cincinnati should be retained
in the public service and the supplies for that Post be generally derived
from Tampa Bay, with the exception of the article of flour, which
the Commanding General thinks had better be supplied from the
north.
I am futher directed by the General to say, that he relies greatly
on your habits of economy, in public expenditures, to reduce the
water craft in the service of the United States, connected with the
9* Department, to the lowest amount practicable, with reference to
the good of the Service.”

STAUGUSTINE E FApril 7th 1843
SIR I mentioned in my letter of the 7” the seizure of the Brig
Nimrod and her cargo of Live oak—she was seized by my direction on
the 3" of March and is now undergoing an investigation before the
court of admiralty which was convened for that purpose on the 5"
inst—The defendants in the suit Messrs Palmer & Ferris on behalf
the live oak and Capt Smith on the part of the vessel used their ut-
most efforts to have the case put off but failed in their undertaking.
The question having been decided this day that the trial must pro-
gress immediately—The oak on board is insured for 10.000$ which
goes to show the value of the cargo—The Brig is valued at 4.000$
and in my opinion there is not the least doubt but that the Brig and
cargo will be condemned, and I would suggest to You the propriety
of the Department in appointing an agent to bid on behalf of the
Government, for if she is put up at public auction to be sold for cash,
the Brig and cargo would not bring two thousand dollars, -You will
perceive in that event the Government could but be deprived of her
just rights.—We on the behalf of Government would have been
willing to bond the vessel and cargo for ten or eleven thousand dollars,
but they being unable to give sufficient security, she will be compelled
to remain here until the case is decided. It is proper for me to remark
that this cargo consists of 5000 feet or upwards of the very choisest

description of Live oak, every stick being such as calculated for beams
and kelson peices—
There is now about 6 or 7000 thousand feet of Live oak at New
Smyrna which has been cut from the public lands and part of the same
being hauled to the landing and the remainder still lays in the ham-
mock—I shall make a seizure of it immediately, and if they will give
bonds for the delivery of it to the Navy Yard for which it is intended,
the proceeds to be retained in the hands of the Government, till all
issues may be settled in a court of justice I shall permit them to do so,
for it would be much more to the advantage of the Gov than it would
to have it disposed of at public auction here.
As I am here to report facts, as near as they present themselves to
me without predjudice, I will take this opportunity to state that all
diligence and perseverance has been used by Mr Douglass on behalf of
the Government from the term of the superior court commencing on
the 13" of March last until the present day—and I hope that I shall
not be under the necessity of stating to the Department again that I
think he is neglecting his duty.
As I perceive that You have reccommended to congress the neces-
sity, of having crafts of some description in this vicinity for the pro-
tection of Live oak. I would suggest to You the advantages it would
be to the General government to have the Schooner “Walter M”
transferred to the navy Department for that purpose,—I under-
stand that the Qr Master has no further occasion for her and that
she will be laid up or sold in a few weeks. She is a good Sea vessel.
of light draught of water, not over 4 feet and well calculated for the
purpose—all repairs that she could require would not cost over 250$
I will here give You the present expense of sailing her—there being
seven men including the captain and Mate it amounts to 235 dol-
lars—By shipping a regular crew the expense could be reduced 25
dollars leaving a nett expense of 210$ prmonth or 25208 per annum-
I will slightly set forth the difference in expense between running a
Steam Boat and a Schooner—by furnishing You with a description
of some part of the coast on the Atlantic side and the price of Steam
boat fuel—At St Augustine the price of wood is 4$ per cord.—at
Mosquito it would be difficult to obtain any, unless there should
be some one there for the express purpose of procuring it, and it
would have to be hauled and flatted a long distance. The water on
the Mosquito Bar at the average tide is about eleven feet six inches.-
If there was a canal cut through at the haulover to Indian river about
40 miles south of Mosquito it would cause all the water from that
source to pass over mosquito Bar which would undoubtedly deepen
the water to about 16 or 17 feet—I have made a rough estimate of


## p. 641 (#657) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 641
the cost of making said canal 30 feet wide and six feet deep, which
would not exceed 10.000$—The waters in Indian river are about two
feet higher than that on the Mosquito Lagoon—that would
give a fine navigation to a rich tract of country and facilitate the
Government in procuring a large quantity of Live oak and red cedar
timber whenever they should require it—The Bar at Indian river at
present is very indifferent there not being over 4 feet at average tides.
The same difficulty presents itself there in respect to Steamboat wood
as it does at Mosquito, and You will perceive that the same difficul-
ties are to be met with at all the Bars between that and the cape,
and there will be undoubtedly a large trade carried on in Live oak
timber in that Section of the Country the ensuing winter—as some
of those Bars at the different rivers and inlets average from 7 to 9
feet of water, and a Steam boat could not possibly cruise from one
place to another at some seasons of the Year more than once in 3
or 4 months unless she was calculated expressly for a Sea boat, and
then her draught of water would be too great to enter any of those
Southern inlets and rivers whereas a schooner could seldom be
delayed, and could run in under ballast wherever there was 4 feet of
Water.—
The expense of victualling and manning a Steam Boat it would be
entirely unnecessary for me to set forth as You are perfectly con-
versant with that subject.”
I beg that You may reply as soon as practicable to such portions
of this letter as You may deem requisite

directed him to do during my absence—The Settlers it appears place
great dependence in the decision of this question, as to their right
to cut and sell Live oak, before they have complied with the act of
congress made and provided for the armed occupation and settlement
of Florida. I will here state that if they should have that right,
there will be four or five hundred engaged the ensuing winter in cut-
ting and selling Live oak in all directions as that appears to be the
principal object of a great portion of those settlers. The trial above
mentioned is progressing rapidly and there is nothing in my opinion
can save the Brig and cargo from being condemned.
I will ask You to inform me if I can create any more expenses, if
not, I shall most probably lose very important suits against Palmer
& Ferris and others, which have been instituted on behalf the United
States. Those suits amount to 150 or 200.000 dollars—The nature
of them is for cutting Live and destroying red cedar timber.—I once
more remark that we cannot sustain a suit without positive proof
that the land which we alledge to be public is so, and that we have to
test with chain and compass.

SIR. I have to invite your attention to the fact that there is in
the Office of the Late Receiver of public moneys at Tallahassee an
iron safe of unusually large capacity, too large for the purposes of
the late Receiver, who, obtained authority from the Secretary of the
Treasury to procure one of smaller dimensions, in view of a suggestion
made by this Office that the large safe might be made to answer the
more useful purpose of protecting from the casualty of fire the impor-
tant field notes & other Archives of your office.”
I will thank you to examine the safe alluded to and report to me
your opinion of its usefulness to your Office, and estimate the cost of
its transportation to S*Augustine in the event of the removal of your
Office to that City.

by upwards of one hundred and fifty Citizens of the County of S'

Generals Office to S*Augustine"—

Collector's office ST: AUGUSTINE E. F. April 20*1843
SIR: On the 7" ultimo.” I had the honor of informing you that
I had caused the Brig “Nimrod” of Hollowell, Maine, burthen 19740/
95 tons, Thomas Smith, master to be seized, said Brig being loaded
almost entirely, if not altogether with live oak cut from the Public
lands, and that I had also directed the proper legal proceedings to be
instituted against said vessel and cargo. It now becomes my duty to
add that after a protracted session, this case was decided in the
Superior Court for the District of East Florida, sitting at St: Augustine,
and a decree rendered on the 18" instant declaring the vessel, together
with her tackle, apparel and furniture to be forfeited, and directing
the same to be sold on the 28* instant, ordering further that out of
the Seventy six sticks composing her cargo, sixty six proved to have
have been cut on lands belonging to the United States, be delivered
to the Government agent charged with the preservation of live oak;
the value of these sixty six sticks is, I am informed from eight to nine
thousand dollars.
Doubtless every effort will be made by the parties interested,
Mess" Palmer & Ferris and the owners of the Brig, to have the whole
or part of the above penalties remitted, the first who have become
enriched by preying, until now unchecked, on the live oak timber
belonging to the Government, the last for a long time past associated
in carrying the live oak thus obtained; but I can not beleive, permit

me to say, that their application can meet with success, overlooking
the facts as they relate to myself, the heavy responsability, respons-
ability indeed which until this instance every officer of the Govern-
ment has feared to incur, and which I have taken upon myself in
effecting the seizure of this Brig and cargo, laying myself open if
unsuccessful to a personal suit in damages for the whole amount, the
personal danger from the little respect paid to the laws securing the
lives of persons in this portion of country, the anxiety, labor, and
expense caused me by these proceedings, for the whole of this strictly
speaking it was perhaps my duty to do; I would be allowed to show
the ill effects which are likely to result from an act of mercy, may I
say so undeserved, as the remitting of any part of the penalties in-
curred, and particularly the forfeiture of the Brig. Since the decree
all persons engaged in the illegal cutting of live oak have been
struck with fear, and I venture to say that if it, the decree is allowed
to take its course, no master of vessel will be found hardy enough
to load with live oak, in this collection district at least, until well
satisfied of its having been cut on private land but should the penalties
which have been imposed or any part of them be remitted, the hope
of a like impunity will cause others I fear, to follow the same course,
reckless of the law, and probably many will escape, and the United
States continue to be defrauded. Again if the decree be allowed to
take its course, it will induce persons residing in the thinly populated
districts where live oak is mostly found, and who from want of proper
information are now rather favorable to the depredators, to take a
different view of the subject, from that which they entertained when
live oak was cut with impunity, and lead them from the hope of gain,
if from no worthier motive, to inform the Government of such depreda-
tions as may come within their knowledge.
I would also remark that in this case not only the timber on board
the Brig has been saved to the United States, but a much larger
quantity which had been cut and partly hauled by the same persons,
Palmer & Ferris, and which has now been taken possession of by the
live oak agent.
May I in addition ask to be favored with such directions to the
Court here, as may be necessary to obtain that portion of my share
of the seizure which shall arise from the neat proceeds of the sale of
the Brig?—
I trust, Sir, you will excuse this lengthened statement in favor of
my wish to put you in possession of the whole of the facts in relation
to this matter.”

of the Mails by high waters, did not arrive here until the last Mail—
I have determined to proceed as the Agent of the United States in
defending their interest against the claims for land in the cases now
pending in the Courts of Florida—or which may arise; and wait
the further action of Congress as to my Compensation—
I am well aware that you have no authority in the premises, but
as my services are deemed important, I will take the risk of depending
on the future action of Congress, who no doubt will do whatever is
right and just for the interest of the United States.
Should Congress think proper to appropriate any thing for my
services, they will no doubt take into consideration the delay, and
expense I must incur previous to their action—I think it but right
to remark that the claimants having heard that my employment in
behalf of the U. States had terminated, made to me liberal offers to
engage in the prosecution of their land claims—This I have declined
doing. for several reasons, but principally on account of my having
acted for the United States heretofore, and in their service obtained
a knowledge of the claims, which might be used to their injury—
Obtaining all the information on one side as their Agent, I would
prefer to continue in their Service—I cannot view it as compatible
with the honor and dignity of my profession voluntarily to change

to do so—I shall proceed therefore without delay to S' Augustine,

SIR: I am in receipt of your letter of the 15" Ult” in which you
state that “many Applications having been made to” your “Office by
Females, for Permits to take up land under the occupation Act, -
and the phraseology of the law being somewhat obscure, so as to
leave it doubtful whether its privileges were designed to be extended
to this class of emigrants,” you request directions on the subject.
You state further that “the District Attorney, M' Douglas, to
whom” you “referred in the first instance, inclines to the Opinion
that the expressions ‘any Person, being the head of a family” were
“intended to include this class of Applicants, -who in all instances,
have either sons or slaves, Capable of labor, and therefore of bearing
Arms; but does not feel altogether satisified of the correctness of
this interpretation,” and at his recommendation you “apply to the
Department for its decision and directions on this subject.”

to cases of Settlement of the same quarter Section by two or more
settlers, and providing that the right to location shall be determined
by priority of Settlement, the following language is employed; “and
the subsequent Settler or settlers shall be permitted to locate the
quantity, he—she—or they may be entitled to elsewhere within the
same township upon vacant public lands.”
The words underscored in red ink in the foregoing, (not italicized

the District Attorney's Opinion as quoted by you, Viz.—that “the
expressions ‘any Person being the head of a family’” were “intended
to include this class of Applicants” [Females]” “Who, in all instances,
have either Sons or Slaves, Capable of labor, and therefore of bearing

Application, to bring the case fully up to the requirements of this
interpretation.”

SIR: Under the Act of Congress of the 4" August 1842, entitled
An Act to “provide for the Armed Occupation and Settlement of the
unsettled part of the Peninsula of East Florida,” * cases of the fol-
lowing description have been Submitted to this Office—
1." The Case of W. Clark stated in his letter herewith (A), dated
the 18" Ult.* at Newnansville E. Florida, from which it appears that
he had obtained a permit to settle a tract he had selected “in the
‘Oclawaha Swamp”—that at the time he selected it, “the Land was
dry, (altho Low”) that “since the winter & Spring however consider-
able rain has fallen and” he has “found it impossible to settle the tract
with anything like a certainty of health or making Crops should” he

“cultivate—the River or Creek over flowing a large portion of the
Swamp bordering on that river” &c.
Mr Clark now applies for a Change of Permit.
2" The next case is that of Walter D. Eretson, presented in his
letter herewith (B) dated the 31" Ult” * at St Augustine Florida,
stating that the land which he had “taken up was on a Private Grant,”
and asking that power be given to the Register to change his permit.
In regard to erroneous entries, or illegal Sales of lands Congress
has expressly delegated Authority to the Executive to afford relief in
Specified and enumerated classes of Cases—See Act of 3" March
1819.”—Clarks Comp: Land laws Page 757,—Act of 24" May 1824*
Page 863, Act of 12" Jan 1825* Page 890—Act of 24th May 1828"

locations of the Warrants of the Canadian refugees,”—Act of 34
March 1831* Acts 2" Sess 21" Congress Page 108.
In the Armed Occupation Act however no power, in express terms,
has been conferred on the Department to Authorize change of
location.—
The principle cannot for a moment be recognized or admitted
which would allow a location to be changed either from Caprice or
desire to get a better tract—but where it should appear by com-
petent, and satisfactory testimony to the Register that the land
first selected was of such a character, either by reason of its total
inadaptation to the purposes of human support, and of the im-
practicability of a compliance with the conditions of the Act as to
the erection of a house—continuous residence, and cultivation,
or where the land selected is on a “private grant” and the permit
absolutely invalid on the account, I incline to the Opinion that
it would be no stretch of Authority but on the contrary the Spirit
and intent of the Armed Occupation Act (which expires 4 Aug.
next) would be subserved by allowing a new location.
Entertaining however some doubt on the subject, the matter
is submitted for your advice and directions in the premises.
With great respect Your Obt Servant

WILLIAM J. WORTH TO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL
[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., W 236: LS]
N° 51 Head Qrs: 9" Department ST. AUGUSTINE May 22, 1843
SIR. On recommendation of the local commander at Fort Brooke,
approved and advised by the General in Chief, the President of the
United States on the 30" Dec'r 1830 caused a reservation of public
lands to be made and announced, thro’ the proper officers, including
“sixteen miles square” of which Fort Brooke Tampa Bay was the
center—By the subsequent instructions of the President, the U.S.
Marshal was directed, on requisition of the commander at Fort
Brooke, to remove all intruders and other persons obnoxious to
the good order and discipline of the troops. The law approved
4" August 1842, usually called the armed occupation bill, makes
donations of land &c and by its phraseology allows of settlement
beyond the distance of two miles from a military post but is silent
in regard to any previous reservation for military or other public
purposes.—The intentions of the Government would seem to be
fully manifested by its instructions to the Marshal of June 13"
1839,” reiterated on the 224 Septr 1842" near two months after
the approval of the act before referred to (under which right is as-
serted to settle up to the distance of two miles) directing the removal
of all intruders on requisition as before mentioned—As the right
to occupy public lands on this reservation at any point distant two
miles is now asserted and favored by the language of the permits
given by the register of the land office, it becomes necessary in order
to forewarn those who may ignorantly or perversely subject them-
selves to removal and consequent loss & inconvenience, and to
forearm the military officer in the performance of his duty, to ask
precise orders as to the construction to be given to the act of 4"
Aug 1842 in the foregoing respect; and also that the land officers
may be instructed in conformity therewith " —the opinion of Mr.
Attorney General Berrien in an analagous case maintaining the
government in reserved lands will be found in a volume entitled
“General public acts of Congress respecting sale and disposition
of public lands—official opinions &c” part 2"—page 174.”

diminished in regard to the propriety of a removal to some point

and the new population, which is fast flowing in, as a great blessing.
As you have consented to defer the final decision of this matter to
the ensuing fall, I will postpone for the present any enlargement
of my views. Would it not be well in the mean time to address a
note to his Excellency, the President, and ascertain whether if con-
vinced that the interests of the Government and the people would
be promoted thereby, he would undertake to remove the Office to

SIR, During my peregrinations in East Florida, I visited and
inspected the lines of some of my Deputies in the Field—and com-
municated with all. I beg leave to suggest the following report of
the progress & probable consummation of the Work for the present
SeaSOIn
M Thomas has finished his operations in the field. He is here,
preparing for a full report which may be daily expected. M' Prevost
will probably return in two weeks, M Weightman about the same
time (both contracts complete)
Colo Washington having run the meridian & parallels is now
engaged upon his district.
Colo Reid is prosecuting his work but will probably be detained
some time owing to incessant rains & high waters—his district being
rather low.
I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from M* A.M. Randolph
requesting a suspension of his contract—Of the truth of his statement
I am satisfied; & respectfully request your concurrence therein.
Mr Whitner states that he will require a suspension of his contract
for much the same reasons as those expressed in M* Randolph's

SIR, I have the honor to inform you that being unable to com-
plete my contract within the given time and being fully convinced of
the imposibility of carrying on feild operations at this season in a
proper manner and without great sacrafice of health if not of life
itself, I concluded it best to come home, ask permission to make re-
turns of the surveys I have made, and beg that the completion of
the work may be postponed until the fall or winter—I will state my
reasons for this course and have no doubt of their being satisfactory
to yourself as well as the department at Washington—Before doing
so however let me call your attention to the fact that altho' my con-
tract was signed on the 12" of Nov. & I was on the ground a few
days after, a starting point was not furnished me until the 21st of
Jany consequently two of the most valuable months in the year were
passed inactively by me altho' at a heavy expense all the while–My
first efforts were to establish the boundaries of the military reserve
of sixteen miles square around F* Brooke; After doing this I began
on the meridian run by Colo Washington, and run out the exterior
Township lines from 27 to 32 inclusive and from the Meridian to the
reserve and Tampa Bay on the west, with the exception of a line in
the S.W. Corner rendered impracticable by a heavy & miry Cypress
Swamp; I then sectioned three Townships which as far as I am able
to judge contain at least as much good land as the others all together
& certainly a greater number of settlers—The other Townships which

I had selected as most proper for sectioning, are not at this time ab-
solutely impracticable, but are literally covered by Muddy ponds &
savannas which exposed to the sun of this low latitude emit such
noxious effluvia as to jeopardize in no slight degree the health of the
Surveyor and his assistants, who are obliged in the course of their
duty to spend (I may safely aver) one third of their time in them; to
you sir, as a medical man the dangers of such exposure must be ap-
parent. The big & little Hillsboro’ the big & little alifia,” the little
Manatee & Bullfrog rivers have for the most part their rise in, and
run their entire length through my district, and altho' insignificant
streams in the dry season of winter, become terrific torrents when
swelled by the heavy rains of spring and summer, overflowing their
banks in every direction, and not only causing great delay to the
Surveyor but presenting an insuperable obstacle to the attainment
of that accuracy so necessary to his reputation and to the public
interest—A reference to my notes will shew that I have carried lines
for several miles in water from two to four feet deep, and have only
left them when the water was over the “Jacob Staff” and it
became impossible to set the compass, this coupled with the fact
that I have counted as impracticable only two places in the whole of
this miserable country will suffice to disprove any suspicion of a wish
on my part to recind my contract, because it has unfortunately
proved a bad one—so far from this being the case, all I now ask, is
pay for what I have done & permission to defer the completion of
the work until it can be done in greater security and a better manner
than at present—Being however fully aware of the obligations I have
taken, should you deem an immediate prosecution of the Survey
essential to the public interest, I stand prepared to resume it Sir, let
the difficulties & dangers be what they may, provided however I
receive compensation for my past labours; this is absolutely indis-
pensable, as the means which I calculated on bearing me through my
contract are already expended. Had my work been ready for me,
when I first reached the ground it is more than probable I might
have completed my Survey before the rains set in, which so much
increased the difficulties & retarded my progress—hoping you will
take my Case into favorable consideration I Remain Sir Yr most

SIR, I had the honor to receive from you the papers herewith
returned, being a communication of the 22" inst, to the Adjutant
General, U.S. Army, from Gen' Worth,”—with remarks endorsed
thereon under date the 30" inst by the Adjutant General, and a
copy of a letter of the 22" Sept. last" from the latter officer to Col.
Vose, relative to the reservation of public lands “including sixteen
miles square of which Fort Brooke Tampa Bay was the centre.”
In Gen' Worth's letter I find the following: “As the right to occupy
public lands on this reservation at any point distant two miles is
now asserted and favored by the language of the permits given
by the register of the land office, it becomes necessary in order to
forewarn those who may ignorantly or perversely subject them-
selves to removal and consequent loss & inconvenience, and to
forearm the military officer in the performance of his duty, to ask
precise orders as to the construction to be given to the Act of 4"
Aug 1842 in the foregoing respect; and also that the land officers
may be instructed in conformity therewith.”
Herewith I enclose a printed copy of the instructions dated 25"
August 1842* from this office to the Registers in regard to operations
under the armed occupation act, accompanied by a printed map,
on which the Military Reserve at Fort Brooke is distinctly laid
down.
From this document it will be seen that the location under permits
of any such reserve as the one in question is interdicted. The 3”
Section of the Armed Occupation Act declares “that no right or
donation shall be acquired under this act, within two miles of any
permanent military post of the United States, established and gar-
risoned at the time such settlement and residence was commenced.”
By the term “military post”, is of course understood the Fort and
also the lands appurtenant thereto, which have been distinctly
reserved, and set apart for military purposes.
No location under the armed occupation act can therefore in
my opinion be legally made within two miles of the exterior limits
of this reservation, and to this effect the Register of the Land Office

SIR I have taken the liberty of addressing you in order to obtain
some information relative to the survey of this part of the country.
There are a number of settlers here, and an addition of thirty to
that number is daily expected, who wish to run their land by the
surveyors lines, and I am unable, when in my official capacity, I
am called upon, to fill up their applications for permits, to give them
the necessary information relative to the situation of their lands.
I have made unavoidable efforts to find the lines said to have been
run at some former period, and the surveyors, now employed in this
vicinity have made the same endeavours without success—It is my
impression that as yet no accurate survey has been made of this
portion of the peninsular, if such survey has been made will you
have the goodness to furnish me with some information so as to
find where the lines are run & you will greatly oblige

to watch that Bar—He is now on a cruise South to New River and
for fear they may get a load, and escape his vigilance, I shall take a
cruise there on monday, or horseback unless my phisician thinks it
would be too hazardous on account of the wounds I have received—
I shall not quit my duty or perservence on account of attacks made
by these desperadoes—It is not likely that I shall be able to start
for the north for two or three weeks on account of the injuries I have
received from Ferris—It is proper for me to remark that they have
men watching and waylaying me on every occasion
I will here take the liberty to suggest to the department if they
should succeed in getting a cargo from Mosquito to Norfolk to have a
seizure made there of the vessel and cargo, for they cannot take a load
from that place, without having one half of it government timber to a
certainty—They may ship it to New York for they anticipate, if
they have not already made their arrangements to furnish the Eng-
lish and French Navy with Live oak timber
One of the agents of the latter was up the river St Johns about four
or five weeks ago—I did not see him myself, but understood from those
who did see him, that he was looking for spars and other timber—as
there was an individual mentioned to him, that there was an act of
Congress prohibiting the transportation of ship timber from this
country to Europe, he remarked that he had obtained authority from
the government to do so—

JACKSONVILLE E. F. June 16th 1843
HON A PUPSHUR SecY US Navy
SIR. It is with no ordinary feelings of regret, that I take upon
myself to inform you of an outrage committed on the public timber
Agent, H L Thistle yesterday, by M. Darius Ferris one of the firm
of Palmer & Ferris, who fell upon M* T, and beat him in a most
unmerciful manner, for no other reason than that M T by the honesty
and integrity of his course, as Agent of the Government, has procured
the condemnation of the Brig “Nimrod” and a large quantity of
Live Oak timber, which P. & F. cut on public lands during the past
winter. Of the large number of persons present on the occasion of
the outrage only one,—the Editor of the “Tropical Plant”—published
at this place—had sufficient of friendly feeling toward M* Thistle,
to interfere in his behalf, and even his interference was of no avail,
as the persons present, and particularly M S D Fernandez, (whose
name you undoubtedly have heard of, as desirous of the office held by
M” Thistle, and also of the office of Collector of this Port) laid hands
upon him, and prevented him from giving relief to M' Thistle, who,
during the whole time nade no defence, nor indeed could he defend
himself, so sudden and violent was the attack of M. Ferris.

It is more than suspected that Palmer & Ferris intend to take away
the timber lying on the beach at New Smyrna, which was condemned
and forfeited by the decision of the court of Admiralty. Mr Thistle
stated to me a few days since that he had provided or shall provide
for its protection—This, however, is his business to inform you, not
mine—I take pleasure in saying of M. Thistle, that during a long
residence in Florida, and an extensive acquaintance as a merchant
I have never seen an officer of the Government so assiduous in his
duty as he has been. Regardless of the opposition of all those whose
interest is opposed to his continuance in office, (and they are as
legion) he has from the first gone on in the course he thought right,
and the decision of the Admiralty court has shown that his labor has
not been in vain. Would he but lean on the side of Palmer & Ferris
(whose money and not their honesty makes them powerful) he would
have made more money than his salary, and saved himself a beating.
It is pretended that the continuance of M* Thistle in the office of
timber agent will only be an useless expense to the Government, there
being, as is said, no timber to protect. Rest assured Sir, that where
there is so much smoke, there must be some fire, and the timber
which may yet be stolen exceeds by far the representation given of it
by some interested persons. I write as a disinterested person. I do
not own, or expect to own, a stick of timber in Florida. But I was
brought up among honest people in the State of Connecticut, and
will take the part of honest people in the Territory of Florida be they
who they may"—

therein stated, for an extension of the time allowed for the completion

will withhold payment for the work Completed & returned to your

the Contracts without loss to the United States.
It is stated in M* Randolph's letter that a reference to his notes
will show that he has “carried lines for several miles in water from
two to four feet deep, and only left them when the water was over the
“Jacob Staff” and it became impossible to set the compass,” as it
cannot be readily Conceived how such lines could be marked on the
field, if they have been returned as complete, you should be cautious
how you pass the surveys, as lines not properly marked on the field
are worse that no surveys at all.”

The recent attempt to murder a woman in the immediate neigh-
borhood of Newnansville in the midst of a thick population and at
noon day was clearly, from the attendant circumstances, not the
work of Indians and such was the opinion of the community in which
she resided; on the contrary, subsequent developments leave no doubt
that it was the act of several desperate runaway negroes.
For eleven months, indeed since my announcement of August 14"

JACKSONVILLE E. Fla. June 23° 1843
HON. A. P. UPSHER Sec. U.S. Navy
SIR Permit me to report to you something of the circumstances
of a most gross and wanton outrage committed upon the person
of Capt. H. L. Thistle Agent for the perservation of Timber on
the Public Lands in East Florida by Darius Ferris partner of David
L Palmer in contracts for furnishing Live Oak for the use of the
Navy of the United States—I wish to do so because I think that
you, Sir, as his immediate superior, should know the manner, in
which Government officers are treated and the spirit in which they
are received here in this Territory which has been so long fed and
fattened by that Government—It seems then that Capt. Thistle
in discharging what appeared to him his duty to the Government,
25 Not found.


## p. 667 (#683) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 667
interfered with the interests of Messrs Palmer & Ferris by seizing
Live-Oak cut by them, as was alleged by the agent, on Public Lands,
and also by procuring the condemnation of the Brig Nimrod which
was freighted with Live-Oak at or near New-Smyrna on the southern
coast—
For these causes Messrs Palmer & Ferris were very much enraged
and from them originated a personal attack by Mr Ferris upon
Capt. Thistle, of which I was an eye witness. The attack was
gross furious and unprovoked by anything which I saw in the conduct
of Capt. Thistle at the time, and was intended at once no doubt
as vengeance and intimidation. Mr Ferris is a very large athletic
powerful man in the vigor and prime of life, Few so powerful are
found in our country, He is much above six feet in height While
on the contrary Capt. Thistle is somewhat advanced in years and
rather below the ordinary stature of man—impar congressus Achilli”
—With such physical advantage, and in a country where personal
rights are too little regarded, Mr Ferris made the assault and beat
most cruelly and unmercifully the Government Agent. For what?
For performing his duty as an officer—for manifesting a proper
zeal in the service of his country—for following the dictates of
conscience, in refusing to violate his oath of office–Can it be possible
that in this free nation where men boast proudly of a system of
self-government, that private individuals not only, but officers of
the Government itself must be met by the mob-spirit at every turn—
Is this freedom? what worse tyranny can exist? Must personal
rights be thus invaded and life endangered with impunity? Is
the arm of the Government palsied that she cannot protect her
own servants? Melancholy and deplorable as the fact may be,
it is still too true that no adequate redress can be obtained for such
an injury before the legal tribunal of this portion of the country—
Ought not then some means to be provided, some measures to be
taken, to protect officers of the United States in the discharge of
their duties?—
I can truly say for Capt Thistle, that I believe his zeal for the
interest of the Government has been unbounded—his perseverance
and energy untiring. No fatigue difficulties distance or expense,
has prevented his appearing at the post where his duty called him—
He is always active—always on the alert—if he has ever overstepped
the bounds of duty by doing too much that fact has yet to appear.
This however is the camplaint against him here—He does too much—
If he were quiescent and passive, if he merely drew his salary and
amused himself with the proceeds—if he interfered with the interest
* Not equal in strength.

of no one he would be more popular here and would save money.
But does the Government need popular or faithful servants? that
her interests should be protected—or merely that her offices should
be filled and her money squandered?—I do not believe that Capt.
Thistle can have saved a penny from his pay. Indeed his expenses
must have far outstripped his income, and he is a very prudent
man—His office is no sinecure. I do not believe that an office re-
quiring more labor exposure and hard service exists even in the
Army or Navy—But I have already protracted this letter far beyond
what I at first intended. I will venture one more remark, it is
this—There are very few men who would be willing to brave the
danger, or undergo the hardship of this office as Capt. Thistle has
heretofore done, and is still doing—Excuse me if I have trespassed,
but I trust I have not—

REGISTER & RECEIVER Newnansville S*Augustine Florida.
GENTLEMEN. In continuation of the instructions in my letter of
August 5" 1842,” under the Act of 4* August 1842, entitled “An Act
to provide for the Armed Occupation and Settlement of the unsettled
part of the Peninsula of East Florida,” I have on this occasion to
advise you under the Direction of the President, respecting the pro-
ceedings to be had next in order, to wit, under the fourth condition
and stipulation of the first Section of the Act, in the words following:
“That Such Settler Shall within one year after the Survey of Said
lands and the opening of the proper Office for the entry and sale of
the same by the United States, prove, before such tribunal and in such
manner and form as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner of the
General Land Office, with the Approval of the President, the fact that
the settlement has been commenced and the particular quarter Sec-
tion upon which it is located.”
With the Approbation of the President then the Register & Receiver
are hereby constituted the “tribunal” before which the proof is to be
made in regard to the cases contemplated by the Act.
With a view then to the proper execution of your duties and to
facilitate operations under the law, you will observe the following
directions.
1" In cases where the land was surveyed at the time of granting
the Permit, the “Year” will commence with the Day when your
Office was prepared to Act under the law; and you are requested
to issue a Public Notice Setting forth such date, designating the
particular township of land, the plats whereof were filed in your
Office at that date, giving the names of the Settlers respectively
in those townships to whom Permits have been granted, with the
No" of their Permits [See form of Notice marked A] Note. Copies
of such public Notices bearing a regular and consecutive Series of
No" from N° 1 should it be found necessary to issue more than, one,
should from time to time be forwarded to this Office; and at the
expiration of the Year, a complete Return must be made indicating
all the settlers in such townships who within the Year (the time
stipulated) shall have complied with the requirements of law by
shewing “the fact that the Settlement has been commenced, and
the particular quarter Section on which it is located.”—Said Return

should designate the particular quarter Sections located by the
respective settlers, and should also shew the names of those who
may have failed to comply with the requirements of the Act. [See
form of Return Marked B.]”
2" In cases where the lands was surveyed at any time Subsequent
to the date aforesaid, you will regard the term of “one year” as
Commencing from the day when the Surveyor General shall certify
the township plat; and from time to time, as such township plats
shall be received at your Office, you will issue a public Notice of the
fact, giving a particular list of such townships, and the particular
day when the term of one year will expire in each case. [See form
of this Notice marked C.]
Note. It is not necessary to send to this Office copies of the public
Notices under this 2" item of instructions, because such notices
would serve no useful purpose, as they would not exhibit the settler's
nanneS.
It is proper however, and you are therefore required to make
Monthly Returns, consecutively numbered, of such settlers, as
may from time to time within the “year” meet the requirements
of the Act—those returns also to indicate the N° of Permit, and
the particular designation of the quarter Section according to the
public Surveys, [For form of monthly Return, See paper D.]”
At the expiration of the year in this class of cases, a complete Return
is also required, similar to that called for in the Cases first referred
to in the foregoing.
The Act provides “that in case of the Settlement of the Same
quarter Section by two or more Settlers, the right to the location
shall be determined by priority of Settlement, to be ascertained
under such rules as the Commissioner of the General Land Office with
the Approval of the President may prescribe; and the subsequent
settler or settlers shall be permitted to locate the quantity, he, she,
or they may be entitled to, elsewhere, within the same township
upon vacant public lands.”
Cases may arise under this Section, where the cultivation by A
may be found to be precedent to that by B, and the erection of a
dwelling by B was precedent to that by A. In such a case, priority
of cultivation must govern. In cases coming within this provision
of the law you are required to give a patient hearing to all the facts to
be sustained by credible witnesses, which shall be adduced by the
contending parties.

SIR. Knowing Your zeal for the welfare of the general government,
I take the liberty to communicate with you concerning the collectors
of customs in this Section of the country—I will first comment
upon that of Jacksonville, and will remark that it is all important
to have them act in accordance with me in protecting the government
against those plunderers in Live oak, red cedar and other ship timber—
The act of 1833 provides for a protection in part by the collector,
where he is directed by said law to be fully satisfied in his own mind
that no part of any shipment of such timber from this Territory
has been cut from the public land—Now I will state that the collector
or acting collector of this port Judge Doggett" is most generally
engaged as attorney for all the trespassers in this Section of the
country in Live oak and other timber from the public Land and a
very warm advocate for Palmer & Ferris. and I will not hesitate
in saying that I do not regard him as a man of the strictest veracity
for the office in which he is now acting, and from choice would sooner
assist them in getting away a cargo of live oak unlawfully, from
the public domain, and shut his eyes against any information that
might be given him than to protect the rights of the Department—
I further state that I understand there are a great many applicants
"NA (GLO, Lets. to SG, IX), advising that a requisition had been made
on the Secretary of the Treasury for the sum of $11,000 to defray the cost of
surveying. -

from this place for that office under the impression that it will soon
be vacant on account of the ill health of Mr Dell if he should not
be otherwise removed—
I understand that Stephen D Fernandez is one of the applicants and
several other gentlemen as I am informed with whom I am well
acquainted, and I do consider that those who are thus desirous of
that office, with a few exceptions, should either of them succeed in
obtaining it, would discharge its duties with even less fidelity than
the present acting collector if such was possible as regards ship timber
being taken from the public domain—
I will state that there are but two gentlemen with whom I am
acquainted in this place, who are competent, and who I think would
be disposed to fill the office to the satisfaction of the department—
Henry D Holland who is a practising phisician and Phillip Fraser
an attorney at Law—The latter if I am not mistaken is or has been
an applicant—Doct Holland has not been such to my knowledge, as
I have had no conversation with him upon the subject, and am not

men would do justice, and am also sure that both of them have gained
enemies in vindicating the rights of government since my arrival in
Jacksonville—
The Collector at St Augustine Mr AW Walker I have no fault to
find with, as I have always found him ready and willing to protect
the interest of the government especially against the Live oak tres-
passer—and men who attend most strictly to their duties, have
generally the most fault found with them, and complaints sent to the
department against them—
Before I close I will touch upon Mosquito, as I understand there is a
light house to be built and a collector appointed for that port—I know
of no applicant for that place except John D Sheldon. who is one
of Palmer & Ferris' best strikers using an expression of Mules the
celebrated negro stealer and conspiracer and no doubt he will come
to the Department with high recommendations from Palmer &
Ferris. Stephen Fernandez, Ross & Holmes and all the combined
force of this class, who are ready and willing to violate the laws of the
United States in cutting Live oak timber—I speak plainly and from
experience—At the time I was waylaid and so severely injured by
Ferris, he was not only backed up by a guard of Live oakers, but
had Stephen Fernandez and W* B Ross to assist him—It is proper
for me to remark that this violent attack had been meditated for
months and months and I have often been waylaid by a gang of
their choice men which I had no great difficulty to repulse without

much personal injury to any one, but at this time Ferris made the
attack when I was completely off my guard and unarmed, and the
only and whole cause was on account of the strict discharge of my duty,
in procuring the condemnation of the Brig Nimrod, and for bringing
suits against them for trespassing upon the public domain, thinking
they might intimidate me or prohibit me from using my vigilence—
but they are mistaken—as it will only increase my perseverence,
and induce me to watch them more closely—

SIR, Herewith is a copy of a letter received from M* Joseph
Chaires—as stated therein M* Chaires did apply to my deputy M"
Prevost, while in the field to Survey the said grant, but the calls of
it would carry it many miles out of his district. The petition asks for
“20,000 acres of land known as the Alachua lands about 80 miles
distant from S*Augustine at a place known as big hammock about
20 miles from the river Suwanee and about 60 miles Westward from
St Johns”
The Survey as made by the Surveyor who originally located this
grant was as follows
“I certify that I have measured and deliniated to Don Jose de la
Maza Arredondo a peice of land which contains 20,000 acres, situated
on both Margins of a Creek known as Alligator Creek, said land com-
mences a little above the head of said Creek and Embraces an Indian
town distant about 80 miles from the Post of Buena Vista, and about
40 miles to the North and West of paynes town, (then comes the

traverse of said claim) *M* Prevost reports that no such creek exists
in his district nor could he find any trace of any survey as above de-
scribed within the limits of his Contract and it would appear evident
that the calls would throw the grant many miles to the North and
West—M Chaires however asserts that his claim is a large Hammock
in the neighbourhood of Township 15 Range 22 S & E again my
Deputy could have no other data by which to locate this claim, but
the calls of the original Survey, as made under the eye of the grantee
at the time when the subject was fresh upon their minds—I could not
require him to locate it by measuring with chain and compass 20 miles
from the river Suwanee, and sixty miles Westward from S' Johns,
which in fact he could by no mode of measurement bring into his
district. I have by request, placed this subject before you for ad-
visement—and in connection, I would respectfully ask, if it would not
be advantageous to the Government, to Employ a competent Sur-
veyor whose sole business it shall be to locate and survey Private
Land Claims in East Florida. I fear that continual litigation &
annoyance will arise under the present plan, the Surveys Sales &
Settlement of the Government lands would be greatly facilitated by
having the location of these private claims fixed and determined.

cree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States at the
January term 1836.
The difficulty now arrises that no such lands as those set forth in
the Survey accompanying the decree are to be found; Nor any of the
lines or marks denoted by the Surveyor nor the stream laid down upon
his plat. It further appears that the said supposed survey of Don
Andres Burgevin does not conform to the description of the lands
granted to Arredondo in the original concession or in the more formal
title of Gov. Coppinger dated 20" March 1817
Under these circumstances I have to ask of the Surveyor General
that he will in the exercise of the discretion vested in him order a
survey of the land designated in the Royal order according to the
description therein given, it being evident either that the Survey of
Burgevin is spurious altogether or that it was not intended to denote

be taken, to arrest the confirmation of these claims, is respectfully
submitted to you. These claims were filed with the board of land
commissioners, but the original grants were not produced then, but
copys so called. were offered as evidence of title; nor are the original
grants to be found here, in the office of Archives—The claimants
pretend, these grants were taken from the Archives at this city, at
the time Florida was transfered by Spain, to the United States, by
some officer of the former government, and (for greater security)
were deposited in the office of a Notary in the City of Havana, where
they say, they now are to be seen.
You will remember that during the administration of President
Jackson, that he appointed & sent Genl. Call as the Agent of the
United States, to Cuba to demand and receive of the Captain General,
all papers relating to the lands in Florida that might be in Havana,
under any pretence, & in the custody of any public office." The
Captain General at that proposed to have dilivered to our Agent,
all papers that were under his control, which of right appertained
to the records of this Territory—Previous to Govr. Calls visit to
Havana for the object mentioned, the Arredondos had filed their
petitions with the board of land commissioners of East Florida,
setting up their titles to these lands, and then copys of the grants
only were filed ” It is strange that they did not point out to the
Agent, the office of the Notary, where these grants are alledged to
recorded & deposited. The parties now interested sent one of there
attorneys last winter to Cuba, to procure the grants, which he failed
to obtain—The Attorney (Mr. Gould) in an affidavit he made lately
in court, for the continuance of these cases swears he saw the original
grants in the office of Manuel. Fornari, then acting as Notary in the
city of Havana, but could prevail” on the Notary to diliver up the
papers; he further states he saw the cirtificates of Thomas de Aguilar
to the grants—who is now dead. The claimants have taken out a
commission & filed interrogatories, for the answers of cirtain witness,s
there in named, to establish the authenticity of these grants, by
proving the signatures of the former Spanish Governor White, and
also the hand writing of his secretary Aguilar, and there is little
doubt they will prove all that may be requested of them, for a gra-
tuity sufficient for the trouble, of remembering with acuracy trans-
actions of such long standing. Whether the President or your De-
partment may deem it necessary to have some Agent in Havana to
Superintend the taking of testimony now sought for to sustain

the grants, and to inspect them in the aforesaid Notarys office, as
well as to inquire into the character of the witness,s who may be
examined in favour of the Claimants is respectfully submitted. It
is more than probable if special attention is not given, to this subject,
the United States will be defrauded of three hundred and forty six
thousand acres of land—My impression is strong from a knowledge
of the facts in these cases, they are founded in gross fraud & forgery.
Under your instruction our Commercial Agent at Havana, could
perhaps do all that could be effected, in sifting the testimony to be
taken their, and assertaing the character & credibility of the witness,
and seeking a view of the grants in the Notarys office, & taking
copys of them lest they may be withdrawn & altered before they are
established by proof. The Commercial Agent might perhaps through
cirtain residents, who were intimate with Arredondo senior & junior
discover, the true character of these grants—
You will observe by the list enclosed that the Honble William
Marvin, has recently filed his petition & tittle in a suit against the
United States for seven thousand acres of land. on the St. Johns
river—The time limited, for suit on such claims, expired one year
after the passage of the Act of Congress of 1828.” If the counsel
for the United States were correct in this position, the Court had
no jurisdiction of the subject matter and so it was urged in argument—
As the limitation had taken effect, and the claimant had not in time
availed himself of the preveledge granted by the Act of Congress:
to sue the United States, he stood precisely in the same situation,
as he was before the existence of the law.
It was insisted however for the claimant, that the act of May 1830.”
dispensed with the limitation of the act of 1828. because the latter
act is silent on that point, and that suit now can be instituted as if
no limitation was named in the act of 1828–Under the most liberal
construction of both acts, the party sueing, could not do so longer
than one year after the law of 1830, and the latter act appears but
a prolongation of the preveledge limited by the law of 1828–If this
provision was repealed by the act of 1830 it must be by implication,
and if so, the other provisions & limitations of the law of 1828, are
repealed in the same manner, although, it would seem the act of
1830 was expressley intended to inforce the general provisions of
the law of 1828—The court decided as they considered the point of
Jurisdiction doubtful not to turn the claimant out of court, observing
that as the case must go up to the Supreme Court, they would con-
firm the claim, in order to have the questiones finally settled—We of
course prayed an appeal, & the case will go up

The Petition filed by the Heirs of Turnbull against the United
States for fifty seven thousand three hundred acres was dismissed
for want of jurisdiction This was sufficient for us—but it was by no
means the only point that would have defeated the claim.
It never can be sustained on its merits, and if the want of Jurisdic-
tion, was over ruled in the Supreme Court. cirtain defeat awaits the
claim.
I will further add that one of the claims in the name of Arredondo
Senior covers in one body twenty thousand acres of land, as firtile as
any land in Florida—it is on the North side of a bold & navigable
river called Manitee, which flows into Tampa Bay The other claims
if established will take a large portion of superior land on the Atlantic

DEAR SIR It had by my purpose to call to see you, but have been
confined to my bed for a week past, and feel too weak still to venture
so far. As I am informed however that you think of deciding today
upon the plan you will adopt for the dock at Pensacola, I have con-
cluded to address you a brief line upon the subject.
I wished to request of you to make it a stipulation of the contract
that the work should be done at Pensacola. The appropriation was
urged by the South and independently of the advantage of the dock,
the benefit of the employment of labours, & disbursement of app" at
Pensacola, is of course a fair incident. I mention this because I
understand, that it is in contemplation of one of the contractors, to
in case his plan is prefered, to have the principal part of the work
done in New York.
The ease with which the Independence entered the harbor of Pensa-
cola, induces me to hope that the contract you make will contemplate
a dock which may be enlarged before the work is done to a deek one
suitable for large frigates, should Congress so direct at the next session.

In reference to the plan, it does not perhaps become me to express
a preference, not being much skilled in such matters—but as it is a
subject I feel great interest in, and which the people of the Territory
are solicitous about, I would respectfully take leave to say, that so
far as I could judge, the plan of Gilberts dock is infinitely best adapted
to the harbor & circumstances of the Pensacola station. I may
properly add, that this was the plan which was generally prefered in
the House, and it w" have been so specified, but that we concluded it
best to leave you untrammeled, in case any further experiments or

SIR. I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of
29" Ult° " transmitting township plats & copies of field notes of
Survey of the townships therein enumerated, situated near the mouth
of the Suwannee River, surveyed by E. L. Thomas, under his contract
of last fall, which have been placed on file in this office.
You remark in your letter, that the remainder of the district of
M Thomas is (as Certified to) entirely impracticable, & his certificate
appears on the face of several of the plats. Since none of the above
plats extend West of the Suwannee River, is it to be inferred from
your remark, that there are no lands in his district west of that river,
& that he has surveyed all the land in his district east of the river.
If you are not certain of this fact, it should be ascertained to your
satisfaction previous to your paying M Thomas for the work returned,
and if he has left any land unsurveyed, he should be sent back to
complete the work under his contract, or a sufficient amount of his

You will pursue a similar course in all such cases as the above, to
prevent the Deputies leaving the difficult surveys in their districts
unfinished, & thus causing an accumulation of small unsurveyed frac-
tions scattered over your Surveying district, for the Survey of which
as past experience has shown, Deputies cannot hereafter be procured
at the price allowed in the original Contracts.

the Cedar Key Islands for Military purposes, which as therein required
should have been noted by you on the plats of frac' tp 15 R 13 E, on
which said Islands are laid down. The omission on the plat in this

HEZEKIAH L. THISTLE TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
[NA:ND, SN Live Oak Lets.:LS]
JACKSONVILLE E F July 20th 1843
SIR—I herein report to You all the facts which have come to my
knowledge concerning trespass upon the public domain in East
Florida–
On my arrival in the Territory and entering upon my duties as
Agent on the 9" of May 1842,” I found that the Public Land in the
neighborhood of the river St Johns and all the principal bayous and
creeks connected with that river as far as “Lake George” had been
stripped of most of its valuable Live oak and red Cedar timber.—
On looking thoroughly into the matter I found that the principle
trespassers were those who had Government contracts, and who had
disposing of timber to the Government for its full value—
The only persons I found then engaged in cutting Live oak timber
were Palmer & Ferris—They had resorted to the method of having
eighths of sections surveyed in different hammocks, and representing
to the inhabitants that they had entered and paid for such land, have
cut and carried away all the Live oak from hundreds of acres in the
vicinity of these surveys.—I have ascertained, on examination of the
books at the land office in St Augustine up to the date of February
1843 that they have neither entered nor paid for the first foot of
public land in East Florida–
You will perceive by my communications now before the Depart-
ment that I have taken the proper steps through the courts of East
Florida to check this mode of plunder and to secure to the Government
the amount of damages sustained by these trespasses.—
You will perceive on file where I have mad a seizure of two
cargoes of Live oak which were shipped to Norfolk for the benefit of
the United States.—The Brig which was seized at “Mosquito” was
* Post, p. 706. See Douglas to Blake, July 10, 1843 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets.
Recd.), relative to a permit issued to L. M. Prevost for Fort King, and enclosing
a letter from Gen. Worth stating that the fort had not ceased to be a military
post. Douglas believed the permit should be cancelled. See also Blake to
Douglas, Sept. 2, 1843 (NA, GLO, Fla. Armed Occup., Bk. 5), agreeing, in reply,
that the Prevost permit be recalled and annulled. It was so ordered, in a letter
from Blake to Russell, Register of the Newnansville l.o., Sept. 2, 1843 (loc. cit.).

condemned with the cargo and I have likewise caused and directed
suits to be instituted against the parties for damages to the amount of
two hundred thousand dollars, and to represent more clearly their
determination to persist in trespassing. I will here subjoin the deci-
sion of Judge Bronson in the case of the Brig “Nimrod” and cargo
above alluded to which was tried in the court of admiralty at St
Augustine in April last—
On application to the Land office in St Augustine to which I was
referred in my instructions from the Department, I found it impossible
to obtain such information as would enable me distinguish private
from public Land, as private grants which had been confirmed and
whose locations were named and designated. had been sectioned of
as Public land and sub divided.—Such information moreover as could
be afforded at that office was not of that practical nature, as would
enable me to sustain suits on behalf of Government, or to justify the
institution of suits at all, without employing a surveyor who could
trace out the lines of these Spanish and other grants and establish
the fact of trespass beyond doubt.—Neither could I make a seizure of
any timber, although confident in my own mind that the same had
been cut from the public land, without possitive surveys, for in many
cases grants have been claimed in sections of the country entirely
remote from the named location, and in any direction from the true
starting point that interest or convenience might dictate.—
I have instituted suits against Blanchard & Parsons for the re-
covery of damages to the amount of Fifty thousand dollars for tres-
pass upon pine timber—
I have received information that considerable trespass has been
committed on the river St Marys for supplying Alburti's Mill with
pine timber.—for which I shall cause suits to be brought as soon as
I can collect sufficient testimony to sustain Government in the same—
I would beg leave to call Your attention to the Mill grant of Charles
Sibbald on Trout and six mile creek of 16000 acres which was ceeded
to him by the Spanish Government.—He purported to have ten
thousand acres surveyed at the above named place, in an irregular
form and representing that there was no more public land in that
section, caused four thousand acres to be surveyed in “Turnbull's
swamp “Mosquito” and two thousand acres in “Bow Leg hammock
“Nassau”—The Superior court of East Florida decided against the
two seperate surveys, authorizing at the same time that the six thou-
sand acres would be surveyed in connection with the ten thousand
above named—Mr Sibbald then appealed to the Supreme court at
Washington and there stated in his petition that He could not get
his full compliment of Land on Trout creek without interfering with
private grants, and being aided by other testimony cooperating with


## p. 693 (#709) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 693
his petition, it was decided that he should receive his land according
to the representations of the different surveys alledged to have been
made.—
This decision will be found on pages 313 & 325 10" vol Peters re-
ports, and also on pages 488 to 496 vol 12" same work—You will
perceive by a diagram of Townships accompanying this document *
that if the Government had been properly represented, a decision
would not have been given by which he has obtained not less than
thirty or forty thousand dollars worth of valuable timber exclusive
of the land.—
The Yellow boundary marked “A” represents the survey made
under my superintendance, of ten thousand acres according to the
decision of the court—The blue line marked “B” was added by my
direction, to supply the deficiency in the ten thousand acres, which
was called for within the yellow line.—The square section bounded
by the red line marked “C” will show that he could have received the
entire sixteen thousand acres in a square form, without interfering
with any private grant of an older date than his.—The circular line
marked “D” describes the outside of the space that he cut over in
procuring Live oak and Saw logs which is public land as the decision
of the court now stands—If I had not surveyed this grant and laid it
down on the township plats, it would have been a long time before
it would have been discovered that the statements of Mr Sibbald in
his petition were incorrect in relation to the deficiency of Land, and
the evidence which he had in this case must have been ignorant of
the nature of their oath when they testified to the matter sett forth in
his petition—From the details of this case it will be easily perceived
in what manner advantage is taken of the General Government where
its interests are not properly attended to.—There are many cases
which could be furnished similar to this and some on a more extensive
scale, but I have selected for Your consideration the above as being
a plain and convenient one, and as Mr Sibbald is a gentleman of
influence, if any injustice has been exercised toward him he will be
fully competent to obtain redress—
It would no doubt be beneficial to the General Government to
examine the claims of Mose E Levy and G. J. F. Clarke and see if they
are located according to the call of the grant.—
The great evil now existing is occasioned by persons holding private
grants, declining to bring forward the plats and papers connected
with the same to the Surveyor General during the prosecution of
the public surveys, by which neglect many private grants are sec-
tioned off as public land and no doubt an evil which occurred in many

instances within the last eighteen months, although public notice was
given, and a request issued in the strongest terms by the Surveyor
General to be furnished with them—
The Department will not fail to perceive the confusion which will
ensue and the difficulty which will be experienced by the Govern-
ments in securing just rights unless congress shall appropriate the
necessary means to locate and survey these private grants and ap-
point a surveyor whose duty it shall be under proper restriction for
the faithfull performance of the same, to apply to the keeper of the
public archives for all plats and papers relative to private land claims
which may not be voluntarily furnished to him by the claimants, and
whenever a starting point can be found, to have an effectual survey
made.—Although I would remark that it would be difficult in many
cases to find any on account of the numerous chimney corner or
floating surveys as I term them—. Many surveys of this descrip-
tion according to report were made by G. J. F. Clarke former Surveyor
General of Florida under the Spanish Government—and purport to
have been done at a time when it is well known that a chain was not
permitted by the Indians then occupying that section of the country,
to be stretched upon the land—
He would float down the river St Johns in a canoe and when he
passed a location which suited his views he might in some cases have
marked a tree upon the Shore then calling for his course and distance
would protract, the same on paper as though the survey had been
done—At other times without going beyond his drawing room, from
descriptions furnished by Indian interpreters or Indian negroes, who
could be hired for that purpose, would make plats of Land, and for
his skill in the performance of such duty would receive a high salary
and sometimes a large portion of the land he pretended to have sur-
veyed for different individuals. Among the numerous Surveys of this
Suspicious and valueless character, indicating by their description the
imposition practised upon the Government, I would refer You in
the book of Land claims accompanying this document," particularly
to the grants which will be found on the following pages viz 129–
130–131–137–138–139–13–128–131—132–140–141–142—&c
many of which to my certain knowledge have no mark that would
justify a surveyor to assume it as a starting point and according to a
decision of Judge Story, when a location or starting point cannot be
established no claim can exist although a grant may have been con-
firmed. The Evil which must inevitably result in the final adjust-
ment of claims of this character can be obviated by no other means
than that of Government surveys as previously suggested.—
80 Present.


## p. 695 (#711) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 695
Great advantages on the contrary would be attained by the
Government, and the just claims of citizens would be secured to them,
by having an early attention paid to these surveys, -as but few res-
ervations can be made with safety in the eastern sections of the coun-
try until some distinction is made between private and public Land
and notwithstanding the value to Land bearing Live Oak timber by
our Government for naval purposes, it is daily sought for and pur-
chased by private citizens for the exclusive object of speculating in
its timber.
It is obvious therefore that no time should be lost in authorizing
these surveys in order that a reservation should be made for all the
Live oak, Red cedar and other ship timber that may be required for
the present and future necessities of the Government, having such
reservations carefully and distinctly marked at intervals of about
twenty chains, as “reserve land” to prevent the possibility of any
encroachment by settlers through ignorance,—For if so reserved there
is still an abondance, should it be left to be purchased without re-
straint by private individuals, or to the reckless plunder of Live oak
contractors, the Government would soon suffer for a sufficient sup-
ply or be driven to purchase at exhorbitant prices—
Should this subject meet with the zeal and attention manifested
by Congress in relation to a Live oak orchard some years past, and
which was actually commenced with a view to plant and cultivate it
will plainly appear, that there is no necessity of resorting to a method
so delatory and expensive, as there is one now in Florida planted by
the hand of nature and which could be made available at an expense
immeasureably less.—And should there be a deficiency I would beg
leave to suggest whether it would not be advisable to purchase such
private tracts as may be covered with valuable timber for ship build-
ing, as it is a well known fact that European Governments have
authorized agents here who are endeavouring to buy up such land or
to contract for a supply of timber for their respective navies.
I would state that there are large quantities of valuable Live oak
timber on the “Ouithlacoochee”. There is choice timber also on the
Hillsborrough river and indian river of which it will be entirely im-
possible to make reservations to any extent, until the surveys hereto-
fore suggested shall have been made—
There is also Live oak, red cedar, and other Superior timber for
ship building in the neighbourhood of Lake Harney. Lake Poin-
sett. and at intervals to the head of the river St Johns which You
will perceive runs parralel with the sea board, and at various points
on navigable water in connection with Indian river at a distance
varying from fourteen to sixteen miles and which with a triffling
expense could be made accessable to flats drawing from two to two

and a half feet water.—I have information from those who have
been further South that there is choice timber for naval purposes
at St Sebastian, St Lucies river, Lochahatchee, opposite Jupiter inlet,
at Lake Worth, and in fact all through that Section of country, of
which reservations could with facility as there are but one or two
private grants to interfere—
I am enabled from personal observation to state that there are
valuable tracts on the Kissimmee river which empties into Lake
Ocheechobee also at Carloosahatchee, and Charlottes harbour, all
of which except that on the Kissimmee are on navigable streams,
carrying over the bar from nine to fourteen feet water.—Capt Powell
informs me that those beautiful groves above named remain yet un-
disturbed but if not strictly attended to the ensuing winter a great
portion of it will be seized upon as common plunder, as there is neither
civil nor military power on that side to protect it, which will be con-
sidered a great inducement to persons desirous of procuring the
material—I would respectfully suggest the necessity of having these
reservations made without delay.—
I will now sett forth the means necessary to effect this object and
likewise such meesures as I consider adequate to protect the govern-
ment against trespass—
It would require a Schooner of about Fifty tons burthen with
centre board, and a draft of water not to exceed four feet, provided
with a thorough going Captain and mate who are not afraid of fatigue
and well acquainted with the coast, with a detachment of eight or
ten marines—likewise a small Schooner boat of eighteen or twenty
tons made of light material and not drawing over two feet of water,
with ten or fifteen men and and three months provisions.
A portion of these men should be marines who could answer the
purpose of sailors and boat hands in the small craft. While in the
Schooner of fifty tons to the marines already described it might re-
quire one or two regular seaman. The small Schooner could protect
all the timber in the different Lakes, creeks and rivers from the mouth
of the river St Johns to its head that at Mosquito, Indian river and
in fact the entire eastern coast—while the Schooner of fifty tons
could keep a perfect lookout on the Gulf side and cruise from Cape
Sable to the mouth of the Suwannee river—
It would be advantageous to have an assistant appointed on the
gulf side whose duty it should be to guard the public domain from
the encroachments of the numerous settlers. who are located there
under the act for the armed occupation and settlement of Florida,
as much traffic in live oak will be carried on this winter. Since it
has been decided by the Attorney General, that they are permitted
to dispose of the timber—

By a reference to a letter in the department You will perceive that
my life has been attempted by an assault made upon me by Darius
Ferris,” which fact being corroborated from a letter from Phillip
Fraser and also one from Henry Barnard, forwarded to the Depart-
ment near that date. Added to the fact that the United States
Whale boat in my service as agent was wantonly sunk by persons
unknown. You will be convinced of the importance of the marines
I have asked for in the protection of life and property—You will
likewise perceive by a reference to a correspondence between Genl
Worth and my self. accompanying this document that no assistance
can be expected from the United States troops stationed in Florida.—
These marines should be stout active men who could act as chain-
men and flagmen in all the surveys necessary for making reservations
and in designating private from public land—
I think it would be a saving and all important to have an assistant
attorney appointed who would devote his whole time and attention
to the interests of the Government, and a clerk capable of copying
plats and keeping a book of entries of all the lands and their location
which might be reserved for naval purposes—This means placed at
the disposal of the Agent who should exercise dilligence and perse-
verence could so organise and arrange this branch of service in two
years as to enable a single individual with a small steamboat or
schooner and a suitable crew to protect all the timber in east Florida–
I would beg leave to draw Your attention to the “haulover” from
“Mosquito” to Indian river—the distance being 750 yards through
shell stone of very easy excavation—By cutting a canal through at
this place of twenty or twenty two feet in breadth with about five
feet depth I am confident would not cost over six thousand dollars
and would open a water communication to a very valuable tract of
ship timber, and afford at the same time great facilities to the agent
in its protection. by admitting a water communication through to
the everglades, avoiding the present dangerous and tideous navigation
outside from Mosquito to Indian river Bar—and likewise throwing
an immense quantity of land into market—
By an additional expense of four or five thousand dollars a water
communication could be effected by way of Lake “Ocheechobee”
and the Carloosahatchee, clear through to Charlottes Harbour on
the Gulf side—
I would draw your attention to the pine timber and likewise to
the Black cypress; the latter is equally durable and of much greater
strength than the red cedar and admirably suited for spars and upper
timber, when it was necessary to have the vessel built light and

strong—It would no doubt be beneficial to have some of the Swamps
bearing this species of timber reserved—
The Yellow pine is of superior quality to that of the same growth
in North or South Carolina and preferable to any other for the Gun
decks of our ships of war.—It should be reccollected that the principle
cause of the superiority of the various descriptions of timber in
Florida is its proximity to the Sea board and being impregnated
with the Saline properties of the atmosphere, the texture is firmer and
the Timber more durable—
There is at present a great quantity of this desscription of timber,
but its abundance will not be of long duration, as mills are daily
erecting for its consumption—It is taken first from the vicinity of
navigable water and mostly from the public domain, as it is thus
procured free of cost, and when the timber is once removed if there
should be no other detriment to the General Government the land
is rendered unavailable, as much of this land is valuable for no other
purpose than for its timber, when once stripped there would be no
inducement to purchase it—
All of which is respectfully submitted for Your consideration

ing what lands yet belong to the United States and what have been
offered for sale.
May I ask of you the favor to furnish either M Collins or myself
with such a chart of the reserved lands on the waters of this Bay as
will be our guide in accomplishing the object of arresting the depre-
dations now being carried on!
I will take advantage of this opportunity, to solicit respectfully
your attention to the whole subject of growing and protecting the
live oak on the waters of this Bay. The Depredations committed on
that timber have been very extensive & still continue—To furnish a
single barge load of firewood, frequently such waste & injury is com-
mitted as can not be repaired in many years—and that an enormous
wrong is done to the government for an individual benefit scarcely
worth consideration. There is no person whose proper business it
seems to be to guard this species of property—M Collins, who seems
desirous of doing every thing within the scope of his authority, is
only “Keeper of the Live Oak plantation”—a piece of property con-
sisting of a few hundred acres about ten miles from this City. That
particular tract he protects with all proper fidelity & he aids me in
finding out those who trespass on the other public lands, but he has no
authority to interpose in any way to prevent the trespass—We have no
live oak agent & there has never been I believe any force detached to
drive off persons committing the depredations.
I would respectfully submit to your consideration the expediency
of adopting some system which would embrase the twofold object of
preserving the live oak we already have and cultivating other planta-
tions. To one accustomed to observe the slow growth of the Oak
species in Northern climates, the rapid growth of the Live Oak in this
latitude is truly astonishing—I have seen trees more than a foot in
diameter in favorable situations which have not been planted thirty
years & such favorable situations abound in this part of Florida.—
It is true that abortive attempts have been made to cultivate this
tree but the spots selected have been most unfit for such a purpose &
were chosen apparently with for no other reason than their immediate
vicinity to the Navy Yard.
I have the honor to be Sir! Very respectfully Your obt Servant

GENTLEMAN, Your letter of 13" inst.” has been received, wherein
you suggest the appointment, by the President, of three disinterested
persons to value, in conformity with the provisions of the Act of Con-
gress approved March 2" 1833, entitled “An Act to establish a town
at S* Marks in Florida,” the lots in said town recently advertised
for sale.
I have this day been advised of the approval of the course proposed
and therefore, on the receipt hereof, you will select three good and
disinterested men to make the assessment and return thereof to you
for your government in the case.
You will, of course, perceive the necessity of selecting such individ-

from any cause, of the inability of any such appointees to execute the
service required, you will promptly make a new appointment.

above plats extend west of the Suwannee River, it is to be inferred
from your remark that there are no lands in his district West of that
river, and that he has surveyed all the lands in his district east of the
river. If you are not certain of this fact, it should be ascertained to
your satisfaction previous to your paying M Thomas for the work
returned, and if he has left any land unsurveyed, he should be sent

There are perhaps some three townships of Land west of the Suwan-
nee, and it was with this knowledge that I required the accompanying
certificate, which I had every reason to believe the truth of, as the
said work had been previously returned as impracticable by R. C.
Allen in first quarter 1829, (the same Season of the year, in which
Mr Thomas was out,) and I have been assured of this fact by persons
who have visited that section of the country I was therefore surprised,
taking into consideration all that I had heard and knew of that dis-
trict, that M Thomas succeeded in surveying the whole number of
miles allowed him by his contract and instructions—it is barely pos-
sible that in a very dry Season, these Townships could be surveyed,
but I entertain no doubt of the entire impracticability of doing so
at the period when Mr Thomas was in the field. Under the circum-
stances, I cannot see how he can be required to return and survey
any more under that contract, which required him to run out 350
miles, and his special instructions say “You are not to over-run your
contract” (carrying out the views contained in your letter of 24”
Sept last * Limiting the amount to be surveyed.)
Again, it is utterly impracticable for any accurate estimate to be
made of the extent of lands, or their practicability in an unsurveyed
tract of Country; we may imagine that a certain district contains a
certain N° of Townships, but when a chain shall be stretched over it,
it may prove to be more or less. I would therefore respectfully ask
by way of instructions which shall govern me in these, and (as far as
may be) in all future operations, whether, when it shall so turn out
that a named district contains much more land than was supposed,
and my deputies have completed the number of miles required of them
by their contract, I am to insist on the further survey of the unesti-
mated or unexpected surplus. The contracts of Mess” Reid & Rand-
dolph are thus circumstanced—I should therefore like to hear from
you on this subject at your earliest convenience.
In the recent surveys, when there have been an unlimited number
of exteriors to run out & a given number of Townships to Section, I
have instructed my deputies to do no more Townshipping, than
would allow them in the fulfillment of their contract to Section the
number required; this I thought was the most desirable course, as
the object of the government (to wit) to bring as much land as pos-
sible into market,) would by any other course have been defeated.
In conformity with your letter I have with-held the payment of
M Thomas, until Ishall hearfurther from you on this subject, & haveno
doubt you will agree with me, when you look at all the circumstances,

Office of the U.S. Atty. for W. Florida PENSACOLA Aug 1* 1843
SIR, In compliance with instructions contained in your letter of
the 15" March last” I have after due notice by public advertizement,
received proposals for the rent of the lots belonging to the United
States in this city.
1. Charles C. Keyser a merchant of wealth & respectability proposes
to give Two hundred dollars for one year for the house & lot situated
at the corner of Palafax & Government Streets and to keep the house &
fences in repair for that period—the rent to to be paid annually or
quarterly as may be agreed upon. I think it expedient to accept
this offer—M Keyser having occupied it for many years (upon what
terms or by whose permission I do not know) has had no competition
in bidding for the lot—I think too that it is a fair rent—the house &
fences are old & much out of repair.
2. Parts of the lots C & D, which are contiguous have been en-
closed & long cultivated as a garden by Antoine Collins—for the
portion so enclosed the best offer made is that of Charles Lavallé,
who proposes to pay ten dollars annually for five years. Mr Collins
without making any bid, says that he is willing to pay at the rate of
the highest & claims a preference on the ground of having put up the
fence, which has encreased its value. What equitable claim he can
have on this ground after having cultivated the lot for many years as
a garden, free of rent it is not easy to perceive.

As there are a number of bidders for this lot, I would advise that if
rented at all it be rented to the highest bidder at public outcry—
3. The unenclosed portion of these same lots has been long oc-
cupied by Hanson Kelly the Post Master of this city & he has erected
on them an Ice House & recently a horse grist mill—Knowing there
would be no competition with him in bidding for this lot, he has made
no specific offer, but proposes to pay whatever annual rent may be
assessed by two disinterested persons—
This I think is a fair proposition
4 & 5. For the other two lots there has been no offer. If it be
desirable to rent them, I would advise that they be offered to the
highest bidder at auction—

knowledge of the country & a close examination of his work, taken in
connection with the certificate of Col: Washington, (Copy enclosed
with your letter) you are inclined to credit, & recommend that the
remainder of his contract be rescinded.
In reply I have to state, that from all past experience it would
be exceedingly impolitick and detrimental to the interests of the
United States, to relax the rule which requires that the Deputies shall
leave no unfinished surveys in the districts covered by their respective
Contracts, particularly in those districts where a part of the Surveying
lies in low lands, since the deputies if permitted to do so, would nat-
urally follow the dictates of their own interest, & select the part
most easily surveyed, leaving the difficult surveying (which often
includes the best lands) to be completed at some future time at greatly
augmented prices. Besides it is not clear whether the Department
has any discretionary power whatever over the matter, after a written
contract has been entered into. The cost of the field work at $4 a
mile, being little more than one cent per Acre, it can hardly be sup-
posed, that any land can be found which would not if set up at auction
bring the cost of Surveying.—I must therefore request, that you
will insist on M Whitner's fulfilling his contract by surveying and
returning all the land enbraced in his district punctually within the
period to which you will extend the time allowed for the completion
thereof, as heretofore authorized in my letter to you of the 17* June
last, for the relief of M" Whitner on your representations made to
this Office.
In reference to any payments to M Randolph I have to inform
you, that advances to deputies are not recognized by the Department
(See Circular of this Office to the Surveyors General of the 5" of
August 1840, one of which was addressed to your predecessor, in which
advances are forbidden,”) you will therefore make out, a regular
account of particulars of the part of M Randolphs surveying examined
& approved by you, and for which you design paying, under my in-
structions of the 17" June last, & having taken the receipt thereon
for the amount, you will transmit the same to this Office, & charge
it in your quarterly surveying accounts. This payment as well as all
others for surveying, you will hereafter enter on a tabular statement

was all eut upen procured from the lands of private individuals
from whom it was purchased by said Palmer and Ferris before it
was cut. It seems that the Agent of the Government professing
to entertain doubts as te whether it had been cut upon public or
private land, seized upon it, and agreed that he would ship it to
Norfolk, on account of the Government, paying the frieght and accus-
tomed charges, and “that after its reception at the U.S. Navy Yard
if he the said Thistle should prove to the satisfaction of the proper
authorities that any part or portion of said timber was cut on the

& enclosing the copy of a letter from M T. N. Weightman, one of

fully corroborated by Mr Prevost and other Deputies whose duty it
was to find the old marks & corners.
It is also stated by Mr Weightman, that the Settlers under the

In reply I have to request that you will give your earliest attention
to this matter, which you will make a special subject in your next
annual report, with which you will submit all the important facts in
your possession, or which you may collect, & an estimate for a special
appropriation to pay for the surveying necessary to renew the marks,
in order that the work may be commenced and prosecuted with as
little delay as possible, after the means shall have been provided by
Congress, and thus prevent the difficulties & embarrassments to
which the purchasers & settlers will otherwise be subjected.
From the fact that your Deputies have not been interrupted by
the Indians this year, it is inferred, that there will be no longer any
difficulty from that cause, which has it appears, until lately, prevented
Surveying operations in your district, & that there will be no danger
of the marks being obliterated if now re-established & renewed.
I avail myself of this occasion to impress upon you the importance
& necessity of supervising the work of your Deputies, before paying
for the same & returning it to this Office, so as to ensure the faithful
marking of the corners on the field. If there is reason to believe that

HON: DAVID HENSHAW Secretary of the Navy.
SIR, My situation in the Land Office here, and a previous residence
in the Territory from the period of its cession to the United States,
having afforded me an opportunity of becoming acquainted with its
Naval resources—or with those productions of its soil, which if pre-
served and husbanded will render it the future nursery of our mil-
itary marine—I venture, with the view of promoting this important
object, to lay before you a few suggestions on the subject.
At the period of the cession, the Live-oak, Cedar, Cypress, yellow
pine, Mulberry, and other valuable species of naval timber that still
abound in the interior—were to be found in equal quantity along the
streams and sea coast of the Territory; where they were easily acces-
sable, and doubly valuable therefore, on that account. On the trans-
fer however of the country to the United States, by Spain—numerous

bands of Live-oak cutters, sent in by Ship-builders and speculators
at the North, commenced a system of depredation on, and pillage of
these materials, which has ever since continued, and has not even
yet ceased. These persons most commonly commenced their oper-
ations ostensably on private grants, which served as mere screens for
the depredations committed on the public lands, from which they
obtained the great bulk of their materials—their proceedings being
further favored by the wild and unsettled state of the Country.
Their depredations however, at length attracted the attention of
the Government, and a Live-oak Agent was appointed—who though
an active and efficient officer, held other appointments, which inter-
fered with his new duties. while the confused state of the land titles
and numerous Spanish grants spread over the country, often ren-
dered it difficult for him to act understandingly; or to avoid collision
with the claimants and settlers of the tracts thus imperfectly sepe-
rated from the public domain. The office becoming vacant by the
death of this gentleman, another appointment was made of a person
who did not long hold the situation. This gentleman was succeeded
by another, who proved himself wholly incompetent to his duties, and
otherwise totally neglected the public interest confided to his charge.
The office was finally suppressed!!” and so remained, until it was
renewed through the exertions of our late Delegate Mr Downing;
when it was filled by the appointment ef Majer Cornelius Taylor,”
a resident of the Territory. This gentleman exerted himself with
great energy in the discharge of his functions, but being personally
unpopular, and charged with duties that brought him into frequent
collision with the claimants to private lands, and the settlers of the
country, as well as the Live-oak cutters—he was enabled to effect
but little, when a change of administration taking place—he was
removed from office.
The present Agent, Capt Thistle is a gentleman of great energy,
hardihood, and Zeal; and would form an excellent executive officer,
under a more extensive organization; or directed by some superior
placed at the head of a Department and resident in the Territory.
It is the purpose of this communication to suggest the establish-
ment of such a Department for the more effectual preservation of
the valuable naval materials existing in the country—which are daily
undergoing waste, and exposed to continued and open depredation.
The organization and details of such a Department, might with
advantage be drawn from models to be found abroad; there being

both in England and France, as is no doubt well known to a gentle-
man of your extensive imformation; complete and seperate Bureaus,
charged with the care and preservation of the public forests, and other
materials connected with the interests of the national marine. In
France, the head of this Department is styled “Commissioner of the
Forests”—and is I believe, appointed by, and under the superintend-
ance of “the Minister of the Interior.” I should however state,
that I have no opportunity here, of obtaining correct information
on this subject; or as to the actual arrangments and details of the
system adopted there.
In England also, there is a regularly organized system for the pres-
ervation and economical management of the National Forests; which
are cut and used on a carefully devised plan, by which a regrowth of
the timber is promoted and secured, and plantations of young trees
carried on and annually added to the original stock. These trees,
even while growing are bent and moulded into the different forms
required for use, by a process, the details of which may no doubt be
obtained by proper enquiry into the subject. There are still large
bodies of Live-oak existing near to navigation, both on the St Johns,
and on the eastern and western coasts of the Territory. On Mr
Bulows plantation, situated on the head waters of the Tomoka River,
which connects with Musquito Bay; there are more than two thou-
sand acres of the finest Live-oak yet standing—and large bodies of
this timber are still existing around the head of “Spruce Creek—”
of Hillsboro River, and Indian River Inlet.* Along the upper waters
of the St John's, and in the neighbourhood of Tampa and Vaccasasa
Bays—large hammocks of oak, cypress, and other valuable naval
woods, are still to be found, and might be preserved by the establish-
ment of such a Department as I have suggested, with some directing
officer placed at its head, and resident in the Territory; and em-
powered to appoint and employ additional number of Agents, as well as
to cause topographical surveys to be made of the hammocks or lots
of Live-oak scattered over the Territory—with a view to their reser-
vation from sale and from settlement.
East Florida might thus be made to form one of the most valuable
and magnificient Naval nurseries ever possessed by any Country;
and an inexaustible source of National Strength & power. Large
appropriations are made at every session of congress, for dry
docks, depots, &c.; which should be regarded as the mere appen-
dices of such a Nursery—on which this expenditure would be much

more worthily and wisely bestowed than on these comparatively in-
ferior objects. The sum now annually paid to Contractors, by whom
the Government is always more or less defrauded—would alone serve
to defray the expenses of the establishment here recommended—or
to pay the salaries of the additional officers and agents who would
be required for carrying its objects into effect. I have more than

CORNELIUS TAYLOR TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
[NA:ND, SN Live Oak Lets.:ALS]
WASHINGTON CITY Aug' 9" '43
TO THE HONL. DAVID HENSHAw Secretary of the Navy—
SIR. As the agent of John C. Houston & John Simpson to receive
the payment for their Live-oak timber, cut by John Almand under a con-
tract with the U.S. for certain Ship timber, I beg leave to state that
said timber was cut at Lake Munroe upon the Lands granted to
Messrs. Houston & Simpson, under the Act of Augt. 4*1842 “provid-
ing for the armed occupation &c of East Florida”—The timber in
question, to my certain knowledge, was cut upon their lands, which
were regularly surveyed & settled by them—These men with others,
settled the country under peculiar circumstances, the went into it
under the invitation & solicitation of Genl. Worth, when it was in a
state of Warfare, & great inducements were held out to them by that
Officer; they were promised arms, munitions & Rations until they should
become able to defend & support themselves, these conditions were
complied with but for a short space of time, a month had hardly elapsed
before the Govmt. withdrew the Rations granted to them, & made
the withdrawal in a season of the year when it was impossible for them
to make a crop to support themselves and families; the country being
in a state of Warfare it was impossible for them to clear Lands with
any safety, consequently they were dependent upon the Charity of
individuals who were in easy circumstances for their Support.—
This however lasted but for a short space of time, their industry &
hardihood enabled them last fall to clear their lands & erect buildings,
& a promising crop now bids fair to recompense them for their toil &
hardships—In clearing these lands there were small Hammocks of
Live Oak, which hammock lands, were the only ones fit for cultivation,
consequently must be cleared.—Early in last fall Messrs Almand &
Hopkins (live oak contractors) commenced operations in this Section
of the country, the timber of these settlers being convenient to naviga-
tion was purchased by this firm, & they proceeded to cut & work it up
for their contract to the U.S.—When the first cargo was cut & ready
for shipping, Mr Thistle the Agent for the Govmt. made some diffi-
culty & endeavoured to prevent the timber being shipped to its proper
destination, application was however made to the Secretary of the
Navy for a permit to have it sent to the Norfolk Navy Yard, & he
acceded to this proposition under certain restrictions (which can be
referred to in a letter from the Depmt. to Mr. Bryant of Florida on the
175 STAT., 502-504.

Subject), before the timber was shipped a bond was given, which is
also in the Depmt.
I would here state that under these restrictions two cargoes have
been shipped, & payed for by the Depmt. without any difficulty,
& no difficulty would have ensued in this case but for a dispute be-
tween Mr Boushell (the agent of Almand & Hopkins), & Mr Thistle
the Govmt. Agent, & in consequence of this dispute the timber was
seized.—In making the seizure it seems that the Govmt. Agent
labored under some erroneous impressions, he inferred that Mr
Boushell made a statement that he had taken advantage of the in-
dulgence granted by the Secretary of the Navy, & had cut timber
wherever he could find it—these impressions appear to have been
wrong, as the persons who were present at the conversation between
Messrs Boushell & Thistle have made affidavit that Boushell made no
statement of the kind & that his conversation could in no manner or
form be construed as an asserton of Boushell to that effect, —Their
affidavits I believe are in your Department, as they have been placed
in the hands of Mr. Bryant, the Attorney of Messrs Almand & Hop-
kins, to be laid before you—
I would further state that I am certain that Mr. Thistle has not
been at Lake Munroe since this timber was cut, consequently knows
nothing in regard to the land where it was cut, his seizure is predicated
upon mere Supposition, & he can adduce no proof to shew that these
individuals have trespassed on the public domain.—
In making these statements I would remark to the Depmt. that I
am conversant with all the transactions in this Settlement since it
has been located, it was made under my superintendence & I have
been constantly there & devoted my time & means to the interest of
its inhabitants, they are honest & industrious men, & have toiled
hard to gain their livelihood, & I trust that you will not after due in-
vestigation withhold from them the payment for their timber, which
is justly due to them—The amount is small to the Depmt. but to them
is of material consequence as their means are small, & the trifleing
pittance which is due to them would enable them to procure some of
the Comforts of life which they unquestionably stand in need of
I would respectfully request your decission in this case as soon as
practicable, as I am desirous to leave here for the North.
Very Respy. I remain Sir Yr Obedt. Servant

SIR—As a reference will be made to the Attorney General for
decision as to right on the part of Settlers (under the Law passed on
the 4” of August 1842 provided for the armed occupancy and settle-
ment of Florida) to cut and sell timber from the lands so occupied by
them, should it be decided in their favor, there will be millions of
dollars worth of valuable ship timber cut and carried away, for at the
least calculation two hundred of these settlers under the above named
act, have taken out their “permits” on land that was covered with
Live oak for the sole object of the timber, without the least idea of
becoming settlers
I would beg to be permitted to enclose a printed notice" containing
my views upon the subject of the rights of the settler which is re-
spectfully submitted for your consideration "–

SIR Concerning the seizure of Live oak made by me on the 23"
of Sept 1842. which was cut by Palmer & Ferris. You will perceive
by my letter to the Secretary of the Navy of Dec 6, 1842,” that it
will be necessary to have it undergo an investigation before the proper

I would likewise suggest in relation to the oak laying upon the waters
of “Mosquito” and also that laying in the swamps which has been

deemed it requisite to request the revenue cutter to visit that place
as often as twice per month. And to make a seizure of any vessel
with its cargo, that should attempt to take away the same or any part
of it—I have left the same instructions with the agent whom I left to
transact business during my absence—
I should be perfectly satisfied on behalf of Government to permit
Palmer & Ferris to export to the Navy Yard at Gosport, or such other
as should be named by the Department, all such timber as they may
have cut in that Section, on Public as well as private land, which
timber is all mixed together (such portion as has been hauled) pro-
viding they would give sufficient bonds to satisfy the Government,
when it shall be ascertained what number of cubic feet has been cut
on Public Land, so that the same snall be forfeited to the General

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE
NAVY
[NA:JD, Atty. Gen. Opinions, Bk. F]
ATTORNEY GENERAL's OFFICE. 11." August 1843.
SIR I have had the honor to receive your communication of the
9" Inst,” requesting my opinion—“Whether the Settlers on the public
lands in East Florida under the Act, to provide for the armed occupa-
tion and settlement of the unsettled part of the peninsula of East
Florida, are entitled immediately, by the simple act of settlement
to cut and sell at their discretion the live oak and other timber, on the
whole quarter section; and if not, what conditions and stipulations
must be fulfilled by them, before they are entitled so to cut and sell
the timber on the quarter section on which they have settled.”
The Act in question entitles any person, “being the head of a family
or single man over eighteen years of age, able to bear arms,” who has
made or shall within one year after the passage of the Act, make an
actual settlement, within the part of Florida therein designated, to
one quarter section of land, upon certain conditions thereby pre-
scribed.
These conditions are;—that he shall obtain a permit from the
Register of the Land Office in the district in which he proposes to
settle, describing the place where the settlement is intended to be
made; that he shall reside in said Territory five consecutive years;
that he shall erect on his settlement a house fit for the habitation of
man, and shall clear enclose and cultivate at least five acres of said
land and reside thereon, for the space of four years next following
the first year after the date of his permit, if he shall so long live; that
he shall within one year after the survey of said lands, and the opening
of the proper office, prove before such tribunal, and in such manner
and form as the Commissioner of the General Land Office, with the
approval of the President, shall prescribe, the fact that the settlement
has been commenced, and the quarter section upon which it is located;
and shall within six months after the expiration of five years from the
date of his permit, prove in like manner, the fact of continued residence
and cultivation.
Upon his compliance with these conditions, the settler will be enti-
tled to a patent for the quarter section, upon which his settlement shall
have been made, and the act explicitly declares, that the title thereto
shall not vest before, and avoids all sales, gifts divises agreements
bonds or powers to sell, transfers or liens whatsoever, of such land or
any portion thereof, made of any time before such patent shall have
issued.
* Ante, p. 710.


## p. 716 (#732) ############################################

716 T E R R I TOR I. A L P A P E R S
It is therefore clear, except in the contingency provided for in the
5* Section of the Act, that the title can in no case vest in any settler
till five years shall have elapsed; and only then, upon shewing a
compliance with the condition of previous continued residence and
cultivation.
The enquiry now is, what are the rights of the settler during this
probation of five years, before his claim to the land has matured, so
as to entitle him to a patent?
My opinion is, that during that period he has no right to cut or sell
any timber, except for the purpose of clearing, cultivating enclosing
and occupying the land so settled. The terms of the grant make it
incumbent on him to improve at least five acres. He has the power
to clear cultivate and enclose the whole. But that power must be
exerted with the bona fide view to a settlement. The law will not
permit him under the pretext of settling, to pillage the public domain,
and having done so, by abandoning it, to defeat the leading purposes of
the enactment. He is in the condition of a purchaser upon terms to
be complied with, who until compliance, will be restrained from acts
permanently affecting the value of the Estate. The destruction of
the timber, except for the purposes of the occupation will be waste,
which a Court of Chancery upon a proper application will enjoin.”
I have the honor to be, Very respectfully, Sir Your obedient Servant
JN° NELSON.
HON: DAVID HENSHAW. Secretary of the Navy.
[Endorsed] Florida: Live Oak: Settlers under the armed occupa-
tion & settlement Act are not entitled to cut live oak & other timber
except for the purpose of clearing until they comply with all the condi-
tions of the law.

MAYOR AND COUNCIL OF ST. AUGUSTINE TO THE
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
[NA:TD, ST, Misc. Lets. on Rev. Marine:LS]
ST. AUGUSTINE E.F. August 14" 1843
TO/ THE HONORABLE JOHN C. SPENCER, Secretary of the Treasury
Washington City
SIR, The Undersigned, the Mayor and Council of St Augustine—
beg leave to represent to you, that both during the late Indian War,
and up to the present moment; the coast of this Territory has been
without any Maratime protection—being a bare and exposed frontier,
on which either smuggling, piracy, or the abduction of slaves, may be


## p. 723 (#739) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 723
carried on with impunity—and as we have reason to believe, have
been perpetrated, both by the Indians and evil disposed white persons
in connection with them.
The Undersigned are induced to address you on the subject, at
this particular time, in consequence of certain recent occurrances,
which tend to shew, not only that the slave property of the inhabitants
of the Territory, is threatened with danger; but also the peaceful
relations of the United States with a Power whose possessions are in
our immediate neighbourhood, afford her Agents and Emissaries
opportunities of tampering with our slaves and abducting them
from their owners—which, embarked as she is in the cause of Aboli-
tion, there can be no doubt of her willingness to avail herself of -
and as is otherwise shewn by the following facts.
The recent occurrances to which we allude, are, first the absconding
some six weeks ago of seven slaves from Key West, who seized a boat
in the harbour, and though closely pursued, succeeded in making
their escape to the Bahama Islands; where they have ever since been
sheltered and have no doubt been made free. Subsequent to this,
seven more negroes two of them employed as sailors on board the
Schooner Water M–a vessel in the Service of the United States,
made their escape in the Pilot Boat of the Harbour, having first
possessed themselves of seven stand of Muskets which formed a part
of the armament of the above vessel. There is little doubt that they
have made, as the first party of fugitives did—for the Bahama Is-
lands—having taken with them a compass, and a sufficient quantity
of provisions to last them in a run to that place.
It must be seen that such occurrances, while they tend daily to
lessen the security, and therefore the value of a species of property
on which the prosperity of the Territory mainly depends—there are
other circumstances connected with this last occurrance, which afford
good ground for believing that there exists in some quarter, and
probably in the Bahama Islands, a regularly organized system for
the abduction of our slaves—or for aiding and abetting them in
escaping from their owners. The circumstances that lead to this
belief, are—that a few days after the occurrance above mentioned—
a suspicious sail appeared on the coast and continued for several days
to lurk on and off the harbour of this place; so that her movements
excited general attention. On being boarded by the Pilots, she was
found to have rather a numerous crew on board—but appeared to be
otherwise unusually light, or only in ballast. The Captain however
on being questioned as to his destination stated, that he was in search
of a market for his cargo—which he represented to be of salt—the
vessel itself being as he said from Rum Key, one of the Bahama

Islands. He nevertheless on being left by the Pilots immediately
put about, and steered in the wake of the Water M-the vessel from
which a portion of the negroes escaped, and which had just previously
left the Port for Key West.
Since the absconding of the negroes, the slave of a gentleman to
whom one of the fugitives belonged—had stated to his master, that
the latter, a few nights before he absconded, observed to some of his
comrades, that a British vessel would soon be off the Port; and that
there would then be a good opportunity for those who wished it, to
obtain their freedom. Under these circumstances the undersigned
earnestly petition that a proper Maratime force may be stationed
on this coast for its protection; and that at least two Cutters be
ordered to ply regularly between this harbour and Key West, so as
to form a check on our slaves along the Sea board; and on those
whom it is believed keep up a communication with them, in order
to withdraw them from their owners; and who may incite them to
still more pernicious acts against the latter.”
We have the honor to be, Sir, Very Respectfully, Your obed’t
Servis.

SIR In respect to the amount due to Mess. Palmer and Ferris
for the cargo of Live oak rec" p. brig Nimrod in December last at
the Navy Yard at Gosport, I have the honor to say that it would
be subjecting Mess" P. & F. to a most onerous and, under the circum-
stances, I am perfectly convinced, unjust necessity to resort to
judicial proceedings at Norfolk. The express stipulation upon which
the cargo was allowed to be shipped, was that unless it was shown
to the Secretary of the Navy that the timber was cut upon public
28Answered post, p. 740.

land it should be paid for. That was the contract made by the agent
of the Dep', and submitted to by Mess" P & F, because they had a
brig under charter in the very act of loading, and any delay w” have
exposed them to expence of demurrage. If the authority of the agent
is recognized, the stipulation of a decision by the Secretary, without
expence to P & F, is binding; if not, the Messrs then P & F should be
imm” restored to the possession of their property. They have paid
to the owners of the land for the timber, as they are ready to prove to
you, and there is not the remotest ground upon which any pretence
can be made that it was not bona fide taken from private lands in
the possession of the persons from whom they purchased. The papers
I handed you a few days since will show this, and I would of course
be gratified if the business could be settled at once while Mr. P. is here.
Mess" P & F are willing and desirous to satisfy the Dept. fully
upon the subject, but if you are unwilling to take up the matter for
imm" decision here, I w” respectfully recommend the following course,
with which I believe they will be perfectly content. to wit that the
U.S. Dist. Atty for the East. Dist. of Flo. be directed to satisfy
himself whether the timber was cut upon public or private land, and
make report to you. If he reports that the land upon which it was
cut, was private property, the cargo to be paid for to P & F, without
further delay.

SIR. The late annoyances to which is experieńeed by Mess" Palmer
& Ferris have been exposed, and the course pursued by the late Agent
of the Dept. for the preservation of timber in Flo. will render it
impossible for those gentlemen to prosecute their contracts without
such instructions from the government as will ensure the usual
liberality. It will be utterly impossible for them to effect a charter
of a vessel for the transportation of Live Oak while a forfeiture is
threatened as the consequence of a mistake or dispute in regard to the
title of the Land from which it has been cut. Mess" P. & F. have and

will always act in good faith. They have now a quantity of timber at
their landings ready for shipment to the yards and are desirous to
proceed in its delivery, and in the completion of their contracts.
As has been usual heretofore they desire that where there are doubts
as to the legality of the title under which they may purchase the
timber, or as to the boundaries of the tract, it should still be permitted
them to ship the timber, they being responsible to the Government for
the same price they had agreed to pay the claimant, in case the dispute
of title terminate favorably to the Gov".
It will also be indespensibly necessary for them to be allowed to
cut kelson pieces from the public land as well as from private, (paying
to the Gov" the usual price for it) as it is difficult to find such pieces as
are required.
I am satisfied that the proper course for the Gov" in such matters is
a liberal one as well as just, and I do hope that that the very reasonable
desire of Mess" P & F. will be acceded to.”

One of these permits is to settle on Boca Chico, the others are all
for settlements on Key Largo.
Under a letter from your Department of the 21" September 1842,”
indicating the opinion that “Cedar Keys and other Islands near the
coast should be held in reservation,” all the Keys on the Coast of
Florida have been regarded by this Office as reserved; and as therefore
not subject to the Operation of the Act abovementioned.—As the
permits mentioned in the foregoing however have been issued, I deem
it proper to ask advice as to whether the two islands mentioned are
still reserved, and if not, at what period they were released from
reservation.”

SIR. As Mr Allmand is now here and anxious to enter into some
arrangement concerning his business, I have drawn a rough Bond
which I submit to You for Your consideration and approval—I do not
consider his case so agravated as some others, and would suggest that
as much leniency be exercised towards him as would be consistent
with the law—After a partial examination of the subject I have been
as moderate in the amount of money to be paid per cubic foot as I
could make up my mind to consent to—
The Law of 1831—2"Section” makes no provision for any violation
of the same through ignorance, and I am placed in office as an agent to
protect the rights of the Government, and consider this a question
which requires cool consideration, as I have put a check to the great
evil hitherto existing in the way of trespass upon the Public domain, it
is important that I should take no steps that may opperate as a
barrier—and as all my movements are closely watched by the legal
talent of East Florida, a dout arises in my mind whether as agent I
have a right to compromise for Live oak or other ship timber which
has been cut since entering upon the duties of the agency for the pro-
tection of the same—Pine timber and wood is of a different nature and
comes under a different head—

should direct the revenue cutter to keep a lookout at Mosquito, as
Levy's false representation in behalf of Palmer & Ferris, asking for
the release of timber (being ignorant where the first stick of it was
cut) availed them nothing. there is no doubt but that they will en-
deavour to remove the timber which is now hauled and laying at
Mosquito, amounting to about Twenty thousand dollars worth-

and money remaining in the court at St Augustine subject to the
order of the Department: Suits which could not be sustained, and
money which could not have been received without ascertaining the
fact that they had been trespassers, by Surveys, and furthermore
incurring all of the expenditures which appear in my account current
as necessary to accomplish the object entrusted to me, and to attain
for the Government its just dues—I therefore respectfully request
that such of my accounts which may not be considered within the
authority given me by the Department—may be reimbursed to me
from such money and property as has been clearly shown to be the
property of the United States before the same is placed to the credit
of the Treasury—
The following is the amount as shown in my account which has been
placed to the credit of the Government
$ 50. From E B Ives for pine timber cut on Public Land
$100. from J Mont Mullen do do
$175 from A Parsons do do do
all of which had necessarily to be ascertained by Survey before the
money could be received or even asked for—
$450. or $ 500 now in the court at St Augustine the remaining pro-
ceeds of the “Brig Nimrod” which is subject to the order of the Secre-
tary of the Navy—
$6000 the least possible value of the sixty six sticks which was
condemned by the same court, and pronounced to be the property of
the United States, and already at the Gosport Navy Yard—being
about 4000 cubic feet—as will more fully appear by the decision
accompanying this statement The Brig and Timber is the property
of the United States without doubt, as the limited time for taking
an appeal passed without the claimants availing themselves of the
opportunity—
The following is a statement of the Suits now pending
$100,000 damages against Palmer & Ferris for Live oak timber cut
in the vicinity of Trout creek, Big Hammock, Cypress Pond and
various other places which a page would not suffice to mention—
$50,000 damages against Parsons & Blanchard for cutting pine
timber, and two indictments against each of these gentlemen found
by the Grand Jury
$100,000 damages against Palmer & Ferris for cutting at Mosquito
From testimony already in my posession, it is clearly the opinion of
Mr Douglass U S Attorney that the Government cannot recover less
than $50,000–
The cargo of the Brig Nimrod seized by me in the St Johns river
in November last is likewise still pending—None of these points could

SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your com-
munication of the 4* inst.” on the subject of obliterated field marks
in East Florida, wherein you request me to give my earliest attention
to this matter, & to make it a special subject in my next annual
report with which I am to submit all the important facts in my
possession or which I may be enabled to collect, & an estimate for
a special appropriation to pay for the surveying necessary to renew
the marks &c.
I have but very uncertain data upon which to found such an esti-
mate, but in compliance with the above request will endeavor to
furnish myself with such information as will enable me to carry out
your views as nearly as possible. In the mean time I should be
pleased to have the advantage of any suggestion which may present
itself to your mind in furtherance of this object.
In another portion of the same communication you say “I avail
myself of this occasion to impress upon you the importance & neces-
sity of supervising the work of your Deputies, before payment for
the same & returning to this office, so as to ensure the faithful marking
of the corners on the field—If there is reason to believe that this
part of the work has been sleighted pay ment should be with held
until proper evidence is produced to remove the doubt.”
Permit me to assure you Sir, that I have & shall continue to be
most careful & vigilant in the investigation of the truth & accuracy
of the Surveys which have & shall be made by my Deputies in this
Territory—It is never the less possible after all my efforts to prevent
or detect fraud & imposition—Advantages may be taken of such a

nature as wholly to elude my utmost scrutiny—My greatest care has
been to select only such Agents as were above even the shadow of
suspicion. This I regard the surest guarantee of faithfulness in the
execution of all contracts which have or shall be entered into with
this Department. If, notwithstanding, the high rank & standing of
each & all of my present Surveying Corps, actual imposition or wilful
neglect shall have been practised by either one of them, I shall look
for prompt detection in the rapid settlement of the country & by
means of the Keen scrutiny of those who shall purchase the public
lands—In such an event it will be recollected that the responsibility
of the Surveyor does not cease after the reception of his Field notes &
pay ment for his work. In view of this fact I have endeavoured to
take the amplest Security of each individual contractor.

cation of 31st Ulto * in answer to my letter of 30" June "last on the
subject of a Private claim of M" Joseph Chaires.
Since the receipt of this letter I have used all means within my
power to acertain whether any such survey as that returned by Don
Andres Burgevin can be identified, in the doing of which, I have ap-
plied to the claimants to know if they can identify their land and can
(in conformity with said survey) point out the begining corner, to
which they have replied, that they cannot locate it; I have made
enquiries with regard to the work generally, as done by the said Bur-
gevin and am credibly informed that it was his custon to make what
are styled “Chimney Corner Surveys” which is nothing more than
returning a plat & notes without ever having been on the ground; I
will therefore be compelled to delay further action on this matter

until some one of my Deputies shall be sent in that direction, when
he shall be instructed to give his attention to the subject.
In relation to the appointment of a Deputy for the exclusive service
of surveying private claims, you say—“It would be very proper & in-
deed it is extremely desirable that a trustworthy & competent person
should specially be employed for this purpose, to receive such com-
pensation as may be allow'd by law”. This as I understand it is at
the rate of $4 per mile, you have not fully understood my views as
I intended they sheuld appear te yet to convey them in my letter of
31st Ulto; I thought that such deputy should receive a such salary
adequate te as would conpensate him; or some other mode of payment—
other than $4 per mile, -no deputy of character can be found, who
would undertake this work at this rate, -it would require an
experienced and competent person & any such an one would refuse
to undertake the work—to do one or two miles in one place, then to
remove his camp 20 miles or upwards for four or five miles, then to
wait for the necessary certificates to guarantee that the survey should
be made,—to be idle until such time as the grantee could point out
his begining corners and many other hindrances which will present
themselves to an experienced Surveyor and prevent his accepting a
contract, on which he must inevitably loose money. If a surveyor
could be allowed a sufficient compensation, I would dispatch one on
this service as early as possible but I cannot procure a Suitable deputy
at the price allow’d by law;

on the 3" of said month I had, as Collector of the District of St:
Augustine, caused the brig Nimrod with a cargo of live oak to be
seized at New Smyrna, Musquito inlet, Florida, for a violation of the
1" and 2* Sections of the act, entitled: “An act to provide for the
punishment of offences committed in cutting, destroying and removing
live oak and other timber or trees reserved for naval purposes,” ap-
proved March 2" 1831,” and that I had also on the 6" of said month
directed suits to be instituted against said brig and cargo; I likewise
enclosed a copy of all papers relating to the case.—On the 18" of
april the brig and cargo, less 10/76" or ten sticks decreed not to have
been cut on lands belonging to the United States, were condemmed by
the federal court for the District of East Florida, the brig ordered to
be sold, the cargo to be delivered to the live oak agent; the sale of the
vessel having taken place, the half of its nett proceeds, after deducting
the expenses of the court, was under the 3" Section of said act, and
by order of said court, paid over to me on the 6" of June last.
The live oak, Sixty seven sticks, nine having been left at New
Smyrna by the brig, has since been delivered and received at the
Gosport Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, 10/76" as the property
of the cutters of the timber, Mess" Palmer and Ferris and the balance
as the quantity forfeited, which by the Navy Yard measurement gave
534 feet to said Palmer and Ferris and 3525 as said quantity forfeited.
I would now therefore, under the third section, already referred to,
claim one half of the value of said live oak timber, which I respectfully
beg, Sir, you may direct to be paid over to me.—

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF THE EASTERN
JUDICIAL DISTRICT
[NA:HF, 28 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[September 1, 1843]
To the Honorable Senate & House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress Assembled.
We the Subscribers, Citizens of Florida, residing in the Eastern
District, do most earnestly & respectfully ask the aid of Congress by
an appropriation to open a Road for facilitating the communication
between the Sea coast at St Augustine and the interior Counties of
Alachua, Hernando and Hillsboro’ and in fact the whole southern
portion of the peninsula lately thrown open to settlement by the
termination of Indian Hostilities.
Your Memorialist will further represent that the only link required
to complete the communication is the distance from Palatka to St
Augustine which distance on a Route suitable for a public road would
be from 25 to 28 miles Moreover a large & valuable portion of public
Lands (say from 20 to 30 thousand acres) have been entirely excluded
from Market & must continue so unless the General Government will
aid in constructing a Road by means of which settlers can see a certain
route over which they can convey their surplus produce to Market.
In a military point of view the advantages of this route are incal-
culable, both in saving of distance & economy of time, as Palatka or
some point in its immediate vicinity must at no distant period become
the terminus of a Rail Road across the Peninsula to the Gulf of Mexico
and it will be all important to have good roads leading from thence in
every direction—
In consequence of the nature of this particular section of the Coun-
try, the obstacles to be overcome (consisting of Bay Galls & Cypress
Slushes wet & swampy and a large Creek almost impassable at the
best of times but in wet seasons is a complete barrier to travel of all
kinds) are so great, as to be wholly beyond the ability of the Inhabit-
ants to accomplish unaided by the munificence of the Government.
Your memorialists venture to hope that on a full view of the pos-
itive interests of the United States in this Route (2/3 of which is
through public Lands) your Honorable Bodies will admit the pro-
priety & expediency of the work and make an appropriation sufficient
to effect the proposed object—
And your Memorialists as in duty bound will ever pray.

SIR: I had to day the honor to receive from your Department, a
letter of the 25" Ult° from H. L. Thistle,” agent for the preserva-
tion of live oak and other timber upon the public land in East Florida.
In that letter, herewith returned, M* Thistle represents that “as
many settlers under” the Florida Armed occupation Act of 4 August
1842 “have taken out their permits on lands in various shapes for the
purpose of enclosing as much Live Oak timber as possible” he re-
quests “to be informed whether the law does not restrict them to a
quarter Section in a square form”—
In reply, I have to state that the law does so restrict them and the
Land Officers have been advised accordingly, and from the general
instructions dated August 25" 1842 "printed copy herewith," it will
be seen (page 4) that the selection under the said act, to the detri-
ment of the U.S. of live oak or red cedar timber is expressly inter-
dicted— -
I beg leave to request that M Thistle may be called on to furnish
a list for the action of this office designating the N° of the permits
& names of the settlers represented by him to have taken live oak
timber in their settlements *—

GENTLEMEN Your letter of the 14" of August" last requesting
that a Revenue Wessel may be stationed at S* Augustine for the
purpose of preventing smuggling, Piracy and the abduction of slaves,
is recieved, and in reply I have to state that the commander of the
Cutter upon the Savanah Station has been directed to touch fre-
quently at S" Augustine and the collector of the District is provided
with a Revenue Boat, these arrangements are deemed all that is
necessary in order to prevent infringments upon the Revenue laws.
The suppression of Piracy, or the protection of private property,
are only incidental to the discharge of the legitimate duties prescribed
by law to the Revenue vessels, and this Department has no power to
provide vessels for either purpose, should however the commander
of the vessel fall in with persons committing depredations upon the
property of Citizens or abducting slaves by sea, he will doubtless
consider it his duty to interfere.

of you if any other steps have been taken? if the department have
positively concluded upon such a removal? If yes—when do you
intend to order it? Or if to carry it into effect, it will be necessary

SIR. As You have decided that some of my expenses in surveying
did not come within the authority invested in my commission—but
from the representation of subsequent facts convincing You that
no suits could have been instituted or sustained against the Brig
Nimrod and other cases without those Surveys. You have admitted
the propriety of having those expenses defrayed by the Court I
would respectfully request that directions may be given to have the
70 Cf. post, p. 778.

amount paid over to me, to be applied for the purpose of discharging
the expenses of the Surveys at Mosquito. which remains from the
condemnation of the Brig Nimrod, in the court of St Augustine, sub-
ject to the order of the Navy Department, amounting to about $500
And in relation to the cargo of Live Oak timber, amounting to
Sixty Six Sticks, the value where of is about $6000 exclusive of freight,
and which was adjudged by the court of Admiralty at St Augustine
in April last to be the property of the United States, as having been
cut from the public Land without authority—by a reference to the
act of 1831, third Section,” it will be perceived that one half is awarded
to the informer or informers, by which I should be entitled to that
portion of the same—
To prove more fully that I was the informer in this case I would
refer you to the enclosed copy of a letter to Mr Wallen, Marked A
dated March 3" and likewise to a copy of one to Mr Walker marked
B. and a copy of Mr Walkers letter marked C*—I would therefore
claim one half of the proceeds of the timber thus forfeited but I
would be distinctly understood that I do not request it for my private
benefit, but I wish to have a portion of it reimburse the expenses I
have been to in surveying in the vicinity of the River St Johns—
There would then be a ballance of upwards of two thousand dollars
to enable me to make surveys that are necessary in some suits now
pending, to ascertain private land from public, and which cannot be
sustained without them—
If my request should be complied with, of which I feel assured, it
will be as the law is very plain upon that point, every cent shall be
accounted for by me, for surveys that I may make for the protection
of timber on the public lands, and other services which are connected
with the agency.
There is a subject for investigation now pending before the court
where surveys will be required to insure the rights of the General
Government.—Suits involving property to the amount of ten thou-
sand dollars and without the above named surveys, the Government
is bound to loose the case—
All of which is respectfully submitted, and an early decision will be
thankfully received.”

SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28"
Ult" referring to mine of the 31* July last” which has reference to
the private Claim represented by M. Joseph Chaires—&c. You state
that “Since the receipt of this letter” you “have used all means with-
in” your “power to ascertain whether any such Survey as that re-
turned by Don Andres Burgevin can be identified in the doing of
which’” you “have applied to the claimants to know if they can iden-
tify their land and can (in conformity with said Survey) point out
the beginning corner, to which they have replied that they cannot
locate it” that you “have made enquiries with regard to the work
generally, as done by the Said Burgevin and” are “credibly informed
that it was his custom to make what are styled ‘Chimney Corner
Surveys which is nothing more than returning a plat of Notes with-
out ever having been on the ground;” that you “will therefore be
compelled to delay further action in this matter until some one of"
your “Deputies shall be Sent in that direction, where he shall be
instructed to give his attention to the subject”—
If the Survey in question cannot be identified in the locality, noth-
ing further can be done in reference to Satisfying the claim without
the interposition of Congress.
“In relation to the appointment of a Deputy for the exclusive
Service of private claims,” you refer to what I have heretofore advised
you in the matter, Viz: that “It would be very proper & indeed it is
extremely desireable that a trustworthy & Compentent person should
especially be employed for this purpose, to receive Such compensation
as may be allowed by law”—
You then refer to the sum allowed by law—state that I “have not
fully understood” your “views” as you “intended to convey them
in” your “letter of 31" Ult”—that you thought “that such deputy
should receive Such Salary as would compensate him or Some other
mode of payment other than $4 per mile”—and state that “no deputy

It is of course not competent for this Office to allow anything

SIR: I have received your letter of the 16" Ins'" accompanied by
one of the 11" Ins" from Gen' Worth * in which he represents that
he has “rec" several communications from Citizens who have at an
early period of the operation of the Armed Occupation Act, taken
out permits for lands; situated within the Reservation around Palatka
from which it would appear that they are menaced with the cancella-
tion of their permits”—the General fears “some misapprehension on
this subject,” and thinks “it has probably arisen from making general
to all reserves, originally deserved necessary to military operations,
a Special decision” asked “in reference to the Post of Fort Brook
alone”—and states that “Palatka has ceased to be occupied as a
Military Post and the buildings erected thereon abandoned to the
proprietor of the soil agreeable to Contract, nor is it at all probable
that it will ever be occupied again.” &c.
The 3" Section of the Armed Occupation Act of the 4” August
1842 is to the following effect—
“And be it further enacted, That no right or donation shall be
acquired under this Act, within two miles of any permanent military
post of the United States, established and garrisoned at the time
such settlement and residence was commenced”—

The terms of this provision of law are clear and explicit—
In order to act understandingly in the matter, and determine the
validity of the Permits alluded to by Gen' Worth, it is requested that
you will,
1* Ascertain from that Officer the precise period at which Palatka
ceased to be a “permanent military post of the United States—
2"You will then ascertain in the cases in which Permits may have
been granted within two miles of the exterior limits of that post, the
time at which the “settlement and residence was commenced” on the
lands embraced by such permits.—
In all cases where such settlement and residence were commenced
after Pilatka ceased to be a permanent Military Post, the Permits
will hold, if correct in all other respects—in all cases where such
settlement and residence were commenced before it was ceased to be
regarded as a “permanent Military Post” and whilst it was “estab-
lished and garrisoned” such permits are invalid—
You will make a careful examination into the facts in each case,
and advise the settlers accordingly, and will make a full report to
this Office at as early a period as possible of all your proceedings
in the premises, making special reference to the No" and dates of the
permits and giving your decision in each case”-

[NA:TD, ST Lets. from Exec. Officers:LS]
OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR OF THE TREASURY Sept 27, 1843
SIR In regard to the claim of J. Westcott Jr, for services rendered
in the Court of Appeals of Florida, at the last January term in the
case of the U States appellant v Richard K. Call, and which you
have referred to this office, I have the honor to report, --It appears
by the papers submitted to me that Mr Westcott was employed “As
assistant Counsel to the Dist Attorney by order and appointment of
the Court of appeals.”
On the 6" of February last, the District Attorney Charles J. Sibley
Esq" wrote * that Mr Westcott had been retained as associate Counsel
and that his charge was $100. On the 27th of the same month M"
* Reply, if any, not found. Cf. post, p. 747.
* Not found.

Sibley was informed in the reply from this office,” that the Solicitor
Could not sanction the employment of M" Westcott. The item
therefore, I am obliged to say ought not to be allowed to M' De
Camp, the Marshal who paid it.
It is the design of the office, as far as practicable, to avoid the
expense which has been incurred in times past, by the frequent
employment of professional gentlemen to aid the District Attorneys.
A practice which prevailed, notwithstanding the circular from this
office of the 15" of January 1832,” a copy of which I transmit.
That circular has been modified on advisement so that the permis-
sion to obtain additional Counsel is to be obtained upon application
to the Head of Department usually through this office, and not upon
request made to the President.
It also appears upon examination of the papers referred to me that
M" DeCamp the Marshal, has paid one Hundred dollars to W* H.
Brockenborough Esq, as Counsel fee in prosecutions of the Territory
of Florida against Jeremiah W Powers on four indictments for forgery.
M" Brockenborough having been appointed by the Court at the
instance and request of the District Attorney. These cases of course
do not appear upon the records of this office—but if they did, in the
absence of authority from the proper Department to procure associate
Counsel, the claim could not be allowed. It seems however to have
been paid by M. DeCamp, the Marshal, and I am obliged also to say
in this instance, that the item ought not to be allowed in his accounts.

“on the subject of missing field marks in the old surveys” &c, and
specially refer to the following portion of it, viz:
“I avail myself of this occasion to impress upon you the importance
& necessity of supervising the work of your deputies, before paying
for the same, & returning it to this Office, so as to ensure the faithful
marking of the corners on the field. If there is reason to believe
that this part of the work has been slighted, payment should be
witheld, until proper evidence is produced to remove the doubt.”
In reference to this portion of my instructions, you assure me that
you “have & shall continue to be most careful & vigilant in the
investigation of the truth & accuracy of the surveys, which have and
shall be made by’’ your “Deputies”, and advise me, that your
“greatest care has been to select only such agents as were above even
the shadow of suspicion,” that “if notwithstanding the high rank &
standing of each & all of your “present surveying corps, actual
imposition or wilful neglect shall have been practiced by either one
of them,” you “shall look for prompt detection in the rapid settlement
of the country & by means of the keen scrutiny of those who shall
purchase the public lands”—that—“in such an event it will be
recollected that the responsibility of the Surveyor does not cease
after the reception of his field notes & payment for his work,” &c.
Your letter evinces a commendable spirit, but you must bear in
mind that until the work of your Deputies is fully tested & its
accuracy ascertained by actual protractions from the field notes, you
are not authorized to pay for it—Besides—even if the work correctly
protracts, and you have any reason to believe or suspect any
irregularities or defects either in establishing or marking the corners
or bearing trees on the field, you are bound in any and all such cases
to withhold payment and forthwith institute a thorough investigation.
If such matters be deferred until the errors are detected, “in the
rapid settlement of the country,” and in view of the responsibility
of the Deputies after the work is paid for, a long train of evils and
embarrassments, saying nothing of the danger of loss to the
government in seeking redress, may be the consequence not only to
citizens in the purchase & location of lands, but to the Government
in the disposal of the public domain.
I am induced now to draw your attention in this manner to this
subject in consideration of the complaints that have been preferred
to this Office against the new surveys that have been contracted for
by you.

the 31* Ult° bearing seven signatures, will place you in possession of
the nature of this complaint.
You will perceive it represented that the writers of the letter
referred to “heard at the Manatee that this portion of the country
(alluding to Charlotte's Harbour) had been surveyed”—But to their
“deep regret after the most minute and vigilant search for the
surveyors lines, for a space of at least twenty miles in radius, one line
has been all that” they “could make out; and that ran north from
Charlotte's Harbour towards Tampa Bay”—that on their “arrival at
the Manitee” they “learned that the whole survey was only a 'sham’,”
&c.
The section of country referred to appears to fall within the con-
tract made by you with Samuel Reed.
As these charges go to discredit the public surveys, it is important,
and you are therefore hereby required forthwith to make an enquiry
into the matter (after calling upon M* Reed for explanation) and to
report the result to this Office as early as possible.
This is merely a preliminary measure, to be followed, if further
information should require it, by an order for a thorough examination
of the work on the ground in connection with the field Notes.
I will write under this date to the individuals making the complaint,
for a statement under oath, and in as specific a form as they can make
it, touching the alleged defects in the surveys. A copy of such
answer as I may receive will be sent to you.”

SIR; At the opening of Congress inquiries no doubt will be frequently
made, (as already has been the case, since peace and quiet have been
restored in Florida) as to the number and description of Indians
yet remaining in the territory, and what disposition they manifest,
as to their emigration west, at some future time?–In order to be
prepared for answering such questions as correctly as circumstances
will allow, I have to request that you will please communicate such
information on the subject as you may be possessed of, or able to
obtain. A tabular statement showing the number, arranged according
to the several bands or towns, &c, would be very interesting, and
useful for the Department of War.
Your report of December 19" 1842,” gave the number captured,
&c, of Halleck Tustenuggee's band, also those sent in by Lt. Col.
Belknap from Pease Creek and Carlosahatchee River, and we have
also the numbers taken by Lieut. Colonel Hitchcock in Middle
Florida, and those of Octeartee's people, seized by Brevet Major
Seawell, but I am inclined to believe there are some other Indians of
which we have no account, known as Southern Indians who came in to
Tampa Bay about the close of last year. If such be the fact, will
you be good enough to furnish me with an account of their numbers,
that I may be enabled to complete a statement made March 28."
1842," of the number of Indians and negroes captured, &c. &c.
Since the commencement of hostilities—and any other information
you may be able to communicate touching the subject, as you may
suppose would be useful, or satisfactory, to be known at the War

GENERAL LAND OFFICE September 29" 1843.
To V. Y. CONWAY Esq Surveyor General Florida Territory
SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of
the 30" Ultimo,” and of the plats of Survey and copies of Field notes
of the townships therein enumerated, recently surveyed under the
contract of M Thomas C. Weightman.
According to these plats, three of the townships, to wit, TP. 21 S.
of Range 18 East, and Tps 14 & 15 S. of Range 20 East, include a
number of Settlements under the “Armed Occupations Act,”" which
have been surveyed, laid down and full colored pink on the Said Plats,
so as to interrupt the regular Section lines, and thereby render the
Sections fractional. This was not contemplated in the instructions
from this Office to you of the 24th Sept 1842,” nor in the instructions
to the Registers and Receivers," copies of which were sent to you.
The instructions to the Registers & Receivers treated the Survey to
be made by the Settlers, as a mere preliminary step, to enable you to
lay down their settlements correctly by “dotted lines in the Official
Plats of Survey,” and as “most useful and material evidence in the
final adjustment of the boundary lines of claims before the patents
can issue”, and likewise to enable the settler as required by the fourth
clause of the first Section of the Act, after seeing the location of the
improvement in connexion with the lines of the contiguous Surveys,
to determine the particular quarter Section, which embraces his
improvement, and which he is entitled to claim.
I have therefore to request, that on the plats yet to be returned to
this Office and to the Register and Receiver, you will have all the
Section lines fully run out and regularly laid down, and that in making
such further surveys as may be necessary to effect this object, you
will instruct your Deputies to confer with the settlers on the spot, and
obtain from them in writing the designation of the particular “quarter
Section” which they may respectively select as embrasing their im-
provements and settlements—On receiving such written designation
(which you will carefully retain in your files) You will indicate on the
maps the particular quarters selected, by a full shade of Pink, noting
by dotted lines or shading as near as maybe, the locality of their
settlements and improvements.—

You will likewise instruct the Deputies, in any case where there is
a “Settlement on the same quarter Section by two or more Settlers”
to lay all the facts before you, and you will thereupon report the
Same to the Register and Receiver for decision under the 2"Section
of the Act”
As the plats of the three townships above numerated will not be
placed in the regular files of plats, you are requested to transmit to
this Office, and to the Register plats of Said townships, amended in
conformity to the views expected in the foregoing.
I perceive that the subdivisions of the fractional Sections on the
above plats are made under the Act of 24" April 1820"—that the
lines are drawn with black ink—and that all the lots are numbered—I
have therefore to state for your information and future guidance in
subdividing fractional quarter Sections, that all new plats must show
the subdivisions in quarter quarter Sections under the Act of 5" April
1832, and the circular of instructions from this Office to the Surveyors
General of the 8" May 1832*—that no lot should be numbered which
forms a regular subdivision of a quarter Section, and therefore admits
of being described by its relative position and that red ink must be
used for all the subdivision lines of fractional Sections, as well as the
figures denoting the lengths of the lines and contents of the lots—
Enclosed is a diagram of the Township 17 N Range 4 East of the
4" Prin Mer: Wiskonsan Ter. showing the subdivisions of fractional
Sections situated on Rush Lake, which will serve as an example.

(Copy) STAUGUSTINE, E. F. Sept 29th 1843.
ROBERT B CAMPBELL Esq Consul for the United States at Havana.
SIR. We have the honor to transmit herewith, a Copy of a letter
from the Solicitor of the Treasury, bearing date the 16" Instant.
There are three Suits pending in the Superior Court in this place, on
as many grants, Said to Emanate from the former Governor White of
East Florida. The Suits were originally instituted in the mames of
Fernando M de la Maza Arridondo and his two Sons. The grants
cover, in seperate tracts, two hundred and fifty six thousand, Fifty
thousand, and forty thousand acres of land, in East Florida which the
claimants aver, were issued to them, the fist, on the second day of
April in the Year 1809. The second on the twenty fourth of April
1810. and the last on the twelfth day of January 1811. No such
grants or copies are to be found among the archives of this Territory.
These Suits were instituted against the United States, near fifteen
years since, under a Special law of Congress, & from that time, to the
present, they have been continued, on the application of the claimants
for various causes, but for some years past, on the ground, that the
original grants were in the Island of Cuba. Before the institution of
these suits, the Claimants presented their petitions for the confirmation
of these claims, before the Board of Land Commissioners appointed
under an Act of Congress passed in the year 1822 or 1823, to examine
into the land claims of East Florida, and to report their decisions

thereon, to Congress." At that time these claimants presented
Copies only of these grants, and the report made by the said Board,
was adverse to these claims." In the suits now pending copies only
are filed, and the claimants have uniformly, (until recently) declared
they had not , and did not know where the original grants were, but
now they pretend to have discovered the Originals in the City of
Havana in the Office of a Notary named Manuel Fornari; the same
office from which they had many years since, obtained the copies of
the Grants It is now stated by the grantees, that original grants
were not only recorded in said notarys office, but are there on file,
although they had repeatedly declared heretofore, that the originals
were not in that office, and therefore they could only obtain copies
from its records. If these grants had emanated from Governor White,
they would have been recorded, either, in the Office of the Secretary
or in the Escrebano's Office in St Augustine. All Grants not made by
the King of Spain himself, emanated from the Governor of Each prov-
ince. If the consession was granted, it was usually indorsed on the
petition of the party, conditional, or absolute, as the Governor might
determine. These concessions, and the petitions, were duly recorded
in the Secretary’s office, and when a survey of the lands was made,
a royal title was formaly given to the grantee, and that was recorded
in the Escrebano's Office at St Augustine—no such grants or records
exist in either of the Offices. We are of opinion, the claimants in
fact, have no legal, or equitable right, or claim, to the land in Con-
troversy, and if such grants do exist in the said Notarial Office of Mr
Manuel Fornari they are fraudulent & false. These grants said to be
made by Governor White, So many years past, and so long before the
transfer of Florida to the United States, renders it more certain they
would have been recorded at St Augustine, if they had ever been
honestly obtained. It is for the Claimants to account for this extre-
ordinary absence of all record evidence of their Claims. The Com-
plainants have taken out a Commission from the Superior Courthere,
to take the testimony of certain persons therein named, in the City of
Havana, and you are named as one of the Commissioners. It is im-
portant the United States should have an agent on the spot able to
protect our interests, in these cases, by a full and fair examination of
the Witnesses, that the claimants may produce, to sustain the validity,
and genuine character of these documents; and especially to ascer-
tain by the proof of the signatures, annexed to the grants, if they are
truly the hand writing of the Governor & Secretary, and also to learn
if practicable, when they were actually placed, or recorded in the

Notarys Office—It should be clearly stated whether or not, the grants
are copies and as such have been recorded.—and also if those on file
are not likewise Copies. The Characters & Standing of the Wit-
nesses if possible should be enquired into, and if they have not some
interest in the events of the Suits, and also their respective ages.
Should the witnesses testify in favour of the Grants, it would be
proper to enquire of them, the facts on which they found their opin-
ions, and conclusions, how they derive their knowledge of the facts,
this would show what credit ought to be given to their testimony.
The Credit & character of the Notary—you may perhaps, by enquir-
ing, learn and particularly if his Office, is the proper one for keeping
land titles and recording grants, made by the Governors of East
Florida, or by the Captain General, for lands granted in Cuba. If
the Grantees or any of them, deposited these deeds with the notary,
or ordered them to be recorded, the fact, that the parties interested,
had so directed, will go to prove, they intended some fraud, and
should not claim any advantage by their own illegal act, If these
Grants are recorded in the said Notarys Office, you may easily learn,
if it is the Custon, or Law, in Cuba, for Notary's to record as a mat-
ter of Course, any writing, offered for that purpose, and how far such
a record would be received as evidence in the Courts of Cuba, in
legal proceedings. It might be prudent to ascertain in what office
grants of lands in Cuba are regularly recorded by Law.
We would suggest if you are not intimately acquainted with the
Spanish Language, that you should procure some competant Spanish
scholar in whom you can confide, to attend the examination of the
witnesses, and see that the words as spoken, are written down, as
uttered by the witness not varied, or transposed, So as to change the
Meaning of the words.
The Objects of the Claimants, is, to prove that the copies admited
heretofore by them, to be in the Office Manuel Fornari are in fact
the Original Grants. It is well known that Ex President Jackson
sent agents twice during his administration, to the Captain General
of Cuba, to obtain all the papers in the public offices under his control,
relating to the Concerns of Florida "–that property belonged to its
archives, and Specially for such as related to the land titles in the
Territory. Gen' R. K. Call. now Governor of Florida was the last
Agent sent to Cuba for this purpose, and Mr Thomas Douglas then, as
now, District Attorney, of the United States for this Judicial Dis-
trict, furnished Genl Call with copies of these grants taken [the papers

of Florida—that property belonged to its archives—and specially,
for such as related to the land titles in the Territory. General R. K.
Call, now Governor of Florida, was the last agent sent to Cuba, for

the Claimants, who took the same to Havana, expressly to ascertain
if the Original Grants were there. After due inquiry, & Strict exam-
ination, in the proper offices no such Grants could be found. The
Captain General afforded him all the aid in his power, to collect all
records, which might properly belong to Florida—and it is believed,
he issued an order, or proclamation, to all Officers under him, to
collect & deliver to General Call, all such documents. If a copy of
this order, or proclamation, can be obtained, duly certified by the
Governor, or his Secretary, under the Official Seal, it might be of
service in the trial of these cases—Should you obtain this document,

It is also discovered that your Deputy (M. Weightman) has thrown
the excess or deficiency on the above and other townships in his
district, on the tiers of sections adjoining the Southern and Western
boundaries of the township instead of throwing the same on the North-
ern and Western tiers, as required by the 3" Section of the Act of the

been marked on the field, it is not deemed expedient to disturb them

SIR. In answer to your communication of the 21" Ult°* desiring
to know to what extent your regularly organized Corps of Surveyors
may be called upon to engage in carrying on the Surveying operations
during the ensuing winter, I have to inform you, that, from the in-
formation now in this Office, the principal surveying which will be
ordered, will be between the lands embraced in the contracts of Henry
Washington Esq & Benj" F. Whitner Esq and the Sea Shore, —and
probably South of the lands embraced in those contracts, and East
of Kissimee River. The extent of these new surveys, however, will
depend upon your report, and the conclusion of the work now under
Contract. Should the interest & convenience of the public require
that many of the Townships the exteriors of which only have been
run, should be divided into sections, the area of the new Surveys will
be diminished, of course, as there are only $10,000.—now appropriated
for Surveys in Florida. It is always expected, however, that the
Surveyor General Should report to this Office such work as the public
convenience requires, and which will bring into market such lands
as will command a ready sale, -as, from his position he must, neces-
sarily, be much better acquainted with the wants of the people and

the Character of the soil, than this Office possibly can be. It is
always expedient, furthermore, that no more surveys should be con-
tracted for, than the force provided for in your Office can prepare
for report to this Office, within a reasonable time after their com-
pletion,-as the mere surveys on the field, the plats of which are not
returned, is an outlay of the public money, without corresponding
advantage to the public service.”

[NA:GLO, Lets. to SG, IX.]
October 12th 1843
W. Y. CONWAY Esq S. G. Tallahassee Florida.
SIR. Gen' D. L. Clinch claims being the owner of certain private
claims, the surveys of which were confirmed by the Supreme Court of
the U.S. at the January term 1842, in the case of “The United States
vs Breward”—Peter's Reports, 16–143–These claims, Gen" Clinch
further alleges, cover certain lands in Town: 13–R 21. S & E, now
in the Alachua District, Florida; and that part of these lands have been
purchased at private sale, and part are covered by “permits” under
the Armed occupation law.”
In order that these conflicting interests may at once be settled, you
are requested to have the private claims, above mentioned, surveyed,
and the surveys of them connected with those of the public lands.
I would suggest, that you should employ on this service, one of your
most experienced and skilful Deputies, whose character for honesty
and integrity is unimpeachable, and after having been put in posses-
sion of the surveys confirmed by the Supreme Court, that due notice
should be given to the parties in interest, of the time when those sur-
veys will be located by the Deputy, that they may, if they desire it,

be present. The deputy should then locate these claims, precisely in
accordance with the calls of the surveys confirmed by the Supreme
Court. Should he, however find it impossible thus to locate them, or
should he find any discrepancies between the lines on the ground, run
by Geo. F. Clark," Sur: Gen" and the calls of the surveys as confirmed,
he should report all the facts to you, and his report should accompany
yours to this Office.
The lines of these private claims and their connection with the
public surveys, should be clearly and plainly marked, and if surveyed
in accordance with the surveys confirmed by the Supreme Court (and
they should not be surveyed at all, unless they can be thus surveyed)
a plat of them, together with a plat showing the sections and subdivi-
sions rendered fractional by them should be sent to the land Office,
and another, with a copy of the field notes, to this Office. When Gen."
Clinch furnishes you with the surveys of these claims, as confirmed,
you may find it necessary to give other and more explicit instructions
to the deputy, a copy of which should also accompany your report to
this Office.
No more than four dollars per mile can be allowed by this Office, for
these surveys, -that being the maximum allowed by law for surveys
in Florida Territory, except a special appropriation made by the Act
of 3" March 1837,” a small part only of which remains, and which can-
not be applied to this service.
As this case may be the first of a series, the principles of all of which
may be fixed by it, I cannot too earnestly impress it upon you to be
extremely careful and cautious in the whole business—in the selection
of your Deputy, and in your instructions to him, which should be of
the plainest and most explicit character, and particularly impressing
upon him, that the lines of his survey, must strictly conform to the
survey confirmed by the Supreme Court.
The surveys mentioned in the decision of the supreme Court, may
be found among the records of the Superior Court of East Florida, as
this case was remanded to that Court, to be further proceeded in, as
regards the rejected survey of three thousand Acres. This tract of
3000 Acres does not, of course, come within the purview of these
instructions.
Charles Byrne, of St Augustine, is the person principally opposing
these claims of Gen Clinch. A M'. Lee, also, has some entries, which,
it is alleged, conflict with them.

Office of the Surveyor General TALLAHASSEE October 17* 1843
SIR, I have the honor to receive your communication of the 29*
ultimo,” acknowledging the receipt of the plats of Survey and copies
of Field Notes of Townships surveyed under contract of Thomas H.
Weightman.
Allow me to call your attention to the following paragraph in
your letter. “According to these plats, three of the townships, to
wit, Tp. 21 S of Range 18 East, and Tps. 14 & 15 S of Range 20 E,
include a number of settlements under the “Armed Occupation Act”
which have been surveyed, laid down, and full colored pink on the
said plats, so as to interrupt the regular section lines, and thereby
render the Sections fractional. This was not contemplated in the
instructions from this office to you of 24" September 1842,” nor in
the instructions to the Registers & Receivers, copies of which were
sent to you” Upon referring to the instructions of 24” September
above cited, I find the following “These will aid you in selecting the
Townships to be first sub-divided, and if received in time, will enable
you to have each settlement Surveyed simultaneously with the sec-
tion lines.” “The Settlements should wherever practicable conform
to the Section lines—they should likewise be represented on the
Township maps by a distinctive colour say a pink shade, with the
name of the applicant, and the number of his notice written thereon.”
The Surveys have been made and the plats returned in strict accord-
ance with these instructions, upon which there seems to be no room
for misconstruction—my instructions to my deputies on this point
were copied verbatim et literatim from your instructions to this
office, duplicates of which were promptly forwarded to Washington,
and placed on file, and consequently recognized by you as embodying
your views—as an evidence of the palpable tenor of these instructions,
every Deputy who was sent into the field, has interpreted them in
the same manner, altho' it would evidently have been greatly to

their interest, to have placed upon them the construction which you
now do, and to have totally disregarded the permits in running out
the section lines. Again, in my humble opinion it would be doing
manifest injustice to the Settler to compel him to come within the
Section lines, as in a large majority of cases these lines would cut up
their settlements in such a manner as to render them valueless. Let
us suppose the case of a settler, who under the Armed Occupation
Act has gone into an unsurveyed portion of the Territory, and when
perhaps the land may not be surveyed in ten years—at the end of
that period the surveys are made, and his settlement is so cut up by
them as to throw him almost entirely into miserable pine barren—
Can it be supposed for a moment that Congress ever intended that
a settler after cultivating and improving a rich tract of land, obtained
through the liberal provisions of this law, should be compelled to
abandon his improvements, and be cut off with such land as not even
the poorest man would receive as a gift?
At the time of the receipt of your communication, the complete
returns of Lewis M. Prevost Jr were ready to be forwarded to your
office, but I have now delayed sending them until I receive further
instructions from you upon the matter, as I do not fully understand
what you still require to be done. You say “I have therefore to
request that on the plats yet to be returned to this office and to the
Register & Receiver, you will have all the Section lines fully run out
and regularly laid down, and that in making such further surveys,
as may be necessary to effect this object, you will instruct your
Deputies &c.” I am at a loss to understand from this whether you
intend that a Deputy is to be appointed to go into the field for the
purpose of running, and marking the Section lines which have been
interrupted by the Surveys of Permits, in the work which has already
been returned into this office, or whether the Deputies who have
already returned their work complete, in conformity with the in-
structions they have received from me, are to be required again to
take the field to effect this object, —or do they refer to future opera-
tions, and are the distances through the permits in Surveys already
made, to be ascertained by latitude & departure and laid down upon
the plats? Should a deputy be commissioned for this purpose, in
what manner is payment to be made him for the work? I should be
pleased to receive from you a specimen of the mode in which you
desire the Township plats to be executed.”

DELEGATE LEVY TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
[NA:ND, SN Live Oak Lets.:ALS]
WASHINGTON. Octr 17–1843
SIR. The substance of the letter addressed by me some time since
to the Bureau of construction, and which it seems cannot now be
traced," was to obtain from you in the first place authority for the
large quantity of Live Oak already cut and ready for shipment by
Palmer and Ferris, (under their contract with the Board of Gehaha
Navy Commissioners) to be shipped to the Yards for which it is
destined according to the contract, it being impossible for P. & F. to
obtain any vessels for that purpose while they are exposed to the de-
lays and dangers attending the harsh course of late introduced into
practise in the management of the Live Oak Agency in Florida. In
the next place they desire a prolongation of their contract for one
year, which has been rendered necessary by the interruption of their
business last winter, and in the third place, they ask the issual by the
Department of such instructions as has been invariably its practise
heretofore, and such as are now in existence in respect to one set of
Live Oak Contractors in East Florida (those from Virginia) to wit,
that where any doubt shall arise as to the property of the soil from
which they have purchased Live Oak timber, the timber shall be
shipped to the Yard for which it is designed, and a measurement of it
preserved seperately, so that should the property prove in the end to
be in the United States, the value of the it, at fair and equitable rate,

cation, it will be impossible for them to proceed with any further work
this Winter, and the consequence will be that the arrangements at the
Yards which depend upon the procurement of this timber will be
disappointed, and that the large quantity of valuable timber cut last
season will remain rotting in the woods until it becomes valueless for
naval uses. As I before remarked it is impossible to charter a vessel
for its transportation without a previous deekaratien assurance by the
Department that she shall not be delayed or endangered by prosecu-

NAVY DEPARTMENT October 19th 1843.
HON: D. LEVY Washington City.—
SIR, In reply to your letter of the 17" inst received yesterday,”
I have to remark that the Department will authorise the shipment by
Palmer & Ferris of the live Oak now cut, on the conditions you suggest,
viz: that if any of it shall have been cut on government land, a fair
price is to be allowed to the government for it.
The appropriation for “Increase and repairs” being exhausted, the
Department has no means to pay for any more live Oak on an extended
contract, and this would seem to be a sufficient reason against an
extension.
I do not think it expedient to authorise Palmer & Ferris to cut live
Oak on lands of doubtful title. It seems to me, that the Contractors
ought to avoid cutting on any land but that known to be owned by
individuals.
Orders will be given to and strictly enjoined upon the Live Oak
Agent to avoid all unnecessary interference with persons cutting

V. Y. CONWAY Esq S. G. Tallahassee Florida.
SIR. On the 21" Ult” you advised this Office, that the survey-
ing season for your district was now approaching, and desired to know
the extent to which new surveys would be ordered. In answer to that
letter I advised you on the 6" inst.” that the extent of the new surveys
would depend upon the number of townships, the exteriors of which
had been surveyed, which the convenience of the settlers, or the
public interest should require to be subdivided, as there were only ten
thousand dollars now appropriated applicable to new surveys in
your District. On the 12" inst,” you were authorized to contract
for the location of the private claims, the surveys of which were con-
firmed by the decision of the Supreme Court of the U.S. at its January
term 1842, in the case of the U. S. vs: Breward. The amount of this
contract must, of course, be deducted from the $10.000—available as
above mentioned for new surveys;—and should you be satisfied that
it is necessary to subdivide any of the townships, the exteriors of
which have been surveyed, you will also deduct the amount necessary
to pay for such subdivisions, from the amount above mentioned;—
and further, should the contracts now in execution, exceed the
estimates made of them, so as to require more than the $20,000—
ordered for them, such excess will be another item to be deducted from
the $10.000 before mentioned. The remainder, after these deductions,
will be applicable for new surveys, and to that amount you are au-
thorized to contract for the surveys of the township exteriors, and
subdivision of townships,—the whole not to exceed the amount of
that remainder—of the lands East of the surveys heretofore contracted
for by Henry Washington and Benj" F. Whitner, and marked A. G.
on the diagram of contracts which you sent to this Office being the
lands due East of Townships 18 to 22 inclusive of Range 33, & those
due East of Townships 23 to 27 inclusive of Range 31.

It is understood that there are a number of private claims in the
region above mentioned, which must be accurately located & surveyed
in connection with the public lands. Where they are based upon
Spanish surveys, or surveys confirmed by the Courts, you will be
careful that they are located in strict conformity with those surveys. --
Where there are no such surveys, they must be surveyed agreeably
to the natural or well established calls of the claim, as shown by the
original evidence of title. Whenever the limits of any claim are
vague or indefinite, notice should be given by you to all the parties in
interest, that, at a time & place, to be designated by you, an
opportunity will be afforded them to produce evidence, showing the
true location of such claims.
Where the claims are not founded on any written evidence of title,
and are merely head rights or settlements, you will cause the locality of
the original improvements to be identified by proper testimony, &
survey them in a square form, so as to place the improvement as nearly
as practicable in the centre. But where you can select a tract, say a
section or subdivisions of sections, that will give the area of the claim,
and embrace the improvement, such tract should be selected, and
designated as the survey of the claim. This will save expense, & at
the same time prevent interference with the regular system of surveys.
On the Township maps in every instance, the sectional N°—name
of claimant, -and N° of claim should be distinctly written in each
survey,–and in the table of contents, which forms a part of the plat,
there should be given the number of section—area of claim—name of
claimant—N° of claim,-and date of Report.
The public lands in the Townships, whether full sections or frac-
tional, will have their usual numbers. Where a private claim entirely
covers a section, the usual number of the section thus covered will
be entirely omitted. After all the public lands are thus designated,
the private claims will be numbered in continuation, beginning with
N° 37—in every instance.
In view of the location and survey of these private claims, and of
the complaints of the surveys recently made, as mentioned in my
letter of the 27th Ult” * I would earnestly impress upon you the
necessity of employing such Deputies only, as are skilful & experienced
in surveying,—of cool and discriminating judgment, & whose integrity
is unimpeachable; and as a further precaution, you will, in every in-
stance, before receiving the field notes from your Deputies, instead of
the usual certificate at the close of the original field notes of the
boundaries or subdivision of each township and fractional township
require the following affidavit, to be signed & sworn to before some

No more than four dollars per mile can be allowed for these surveys,
that being the maximum allowed by law;—and I have to request that
you will use the utmost precaution to prevent your contracts exceed-
ing the amount now available for surveys in your District.
Under all the circumstances above stated, it is highly important
that the surveys of these lands should be well made, and in strict
conformity with the laws; and that you may be fully informed on
all points that can possibly arise in executing your duties, I would
again call your attention to a rigid perusal of all the instructions
from this Office.
As fast as protractions can be made from the field notes, copies of
the plats should be sent to the Land Offices, and to this office,—those
to this office should be accompanied by copies of the field notes, when
they can be prepared in time to accompany them.

convalescent but very feeble & am advised by my phisician and
friends to abstain as much as possible from attention to business—
In reply to Your letter of 25" of August I have to inform You that
no appeal has been taken by Palmer & Ferris in the case of the timber
condemned on board the Brig “Nimrod” and as to that of 4" of
Sept, that indictments, and not suits are the proper course of pro-
ceedings in the cases You mention, against Palmer & Ferris for cut-
ting timber on Public Land at Mosquito—
I can lay indictments again before the Grand Jury at the next t rm,
and if Your witnesses should attend in time, the matter can receive
attention, but I shall not feel justified in keeping the Grand Jury in
session ten days as I did at the last term (after they shall be through
with all their other business) waiting for You and all the other wit-
nesses in these cases—
If however as You suggest “the evidence in these cases, will be the
same as that which appeared before the court of Admiralty in April
last at St Augustine” it is well worthy of consideration, that as we in
that case recovered the timber itself which had been shipped with the
accumulated value put on by its having been prepared for ship build-
ing and actually hauled and shipped, which was more than three
times its value when standing, which You know is the penalty pro-
vided by law, whether we can recover again in another form of pro-
ceedings for the same thing—
If we can clearly prove that they cut other timber on the public
land we can doubtless recover for that

I avail myself of the present oppurtunity again to call your atten-
tion to the subject of the appointment of a Salaried officer, whose
sole business shall be the Survey of private claims in East Florida.
The unavoidable delays which must frequently occur, in taking the
testimony requisite to establish the locality of these claims, & to
decide between the important conflicting interests, are of such a na-
ture as to render it utterly impossible for an honest upright Deputy
to undertake the Survey of them at any stipulated price p" mile.—
I am fully convinced that the only mode in which justice can be done,
both to the Government & to the individuals interested, is to adopt
the course now recommended—
The speedy adjustment of private claims, is rendered more impera-
tive in consequence of the great influx of settlers under the provisions
of the Armed-occupation-Act; Should any delay occur in the survey
of these private claims an almost endless train of litigation must be
the inevitable consequence. I therefore earnestly & respectfully
recommend, that the subject be brought before Congress, & an appro-
priation for this service be pressingly solicited.

views expressed in your letter concerning the locality of the proposed

From the best information I have been enabled to obtain I am in-
duced to believe that the lands in the vicinity of Mosquito Lagoon,
Indian River & Saint Lucie sound are of an excellent quality, & from
their situation on the Atlantic coast, are more likely to command a
ready sale, than any others on the Peninsula.—
I would recommend for immediate survey the District lying be-
tween the contract of Henry Washington & the Atlantic, those lying
between the basis parallels C.D. & E.F. east of the Range line divid-
ing Ranges 35 & 36.—& the district embraced between the basis
parallel E.F. & the parallel dividing Townships 33 & 34, & east of
the Range line dividing Ranges 36 & 37.—The appropriation of
$10,000. it is estimated will be sufficient to cover the expense of sur-
veying the Exterior Township lines of the above mentioned districts,
& to admit of the subdivision of 30 Townships. The above described
districts are laid down on the plats of the peninsula accompanying my
annual report of this date.

private claims owned by Gen' D. L. Clinch, has been received. In
accordance with the request contained in that communication, and
reiterated in your annual report, I will present to Congress the
expediency and propriety of the appointment of a Deputy, at an
annual Salary, to survey, under your direction, all the private claims
in Florida.
In addition to the instructions communicated in my letter of the
20" Ult * I would suggest, that in all cases where private claims
interfere with the Sectional lines, the practice is, or should be, that
an actual measurement must be made on the field, from the point
where the lines of the private claims intersect the sectional lines, to
the nearest section corners. This process will prevent an accumu-
lation of errors in protracting, and enable the draughtsman to designate
the points of error, if any exist.”

WILLIAM J. WORTH TO J. J. ABERT
[NA:WD, CE, TB Lets. Recd.: ALS]
St AUGUSTINE NOvr 10th '43
MY DEAR COLONEL. On examination of the accompanying
Sketch you will perceive that by a cut thro' the little strip of Land at
the Haul over (Fort Ann) which Seperates the Mosquito from Indian
river lagoon, marked half a mile, but in fact Seven hundred & twenty
yards, there will be an uninterrupted batteaux navigation counting
from Bulows Southwardly of 270 miles; thence from the Southern
extremity of S" Lucia a slight detour by the Everglades entering the
Miami sea reach, near Key Biscayne, the Inland passage around the
cape to Key West.
With the countenance and support of the Staff departments, and
the consent of the General in Chief, I propose during the Winter to
employ the Troops of this Garrison to execute this work which will
afford, at small cost, imense facilities to the settlers now studding
the Southern Atlantic coast of the Peninsula, tend to bring the public
lands into market and it may be, in the future, greatly facilitate the
transmission of military supplies in respect to time, expense and
avoidance of hazardous navigation and the active energies of an
enemy's cruisers.
The work, which it is not doubted will at some future period be
executed, of a cut from Bulows Northwardly to unite Mosquito with
Matanza, ten miles, is of magnitude—beyond the power of the
military force and of such a nature as will require consideration and
consent of Congress.
Once assured of the support of General Jesup and yourself and at
expense, drawn from monies applicable to current service, not exceeding
$5,500, I think this work so useful to the public & so creditable to the
military establishment, may be accomplished—say from the Q. M."
Department for regulation allowance to soldiers on extra duty 150
men for 120 day's about $2000—for Tools—scrapers Barrows &c
$2000—from the Topographical funds for the hire of a few civil
employees to assist the Engineer, Survey's &c $1000—my officers
and soldiers will be all the better for the employment.
Altho I propose to give Lieu" Blake the service of several competent
young officers he will nevertheless probably need the aid of a Subaltern
of his own corps with some practical knowledge also, I suppose, you
could detach from Cap" Mackay's party—An Assistant Q M', who
can be spared from this Post, will be employed to make disbursements
and in conjunction with Lieu" Blake superintend the execution.
After consulting with General Jesup, who I doubt not is familiar
with the locale, do me the favor to let me hear from you as early as

of the Sites referred to in your letter as to their importance for military

act making appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of

me to say that I consider myself entitled to compensation at the rate
of $1500 per annum for attending to the Settlement of private land
claims in Florida; yet owing to the extraordinary provision contained
in No 173 of the same act & the part that no appropriation was made
during the last Session of Congress for the payment of such com-

[NA:GLO Lets. Sent, Fla. Armed Occup., Bk. 5]
GENERAL LAND OFFICE November 14* 1843.
HONORABLE DAVID LEVY Present.
SIR: I have the honor to return herewith the letter to you dated
the 8" Ult° at Newnansville from D. Reinhardt Esq,” which was to
day received from you, in which he says that he wishes “to Know if
Patents will not issue to” him “for the Lands of his “two deceased
Sons”—that “one died 8" June in his 19" year” that “his Lands
were not surveyed at the time of his death”—that “the other was in
his 32° Year, a part of his Lands were put into Cultivation in April,”
that his “last son had lived in Arkansas for the last 9 Years, and only
got here in May” &c
On examination I find that a permit N° 234 was issued under date
6" March 1843 in favor of John Q. A. Reinhardt and that a permit N°
540—was issued under date 6" June 1843, in favor of Marcus W.
Reinhardt.
These are presumed to be the two cases to which M. D. Reinhardt
refers.—
Herewith I enclose for M" Reinhardt, a pamphlet containing certain
instructions in regard to operations under the Armed Occupation Act
of the 4” August 1842, and also the Act itself, see Pages 6 and 7
shewing the conditions and stipulations on which certain persons shall
be entitled to “one quarter Section.”—
The 5* Section of Said Act, provides “That upon the Death of any
settler before the end of the five years, or before the issuing of the
patent, all his rights under this Act shall descend to his widow and
heirs at law, if he leaves a widow, and to his heirs at law, if he leaves

none, to be held and divided by them according to the laws of Florida;
any previous sale or transfer of the same, or of any interest, legal or
equitable, in the same, to the contrary notwithstanding.
And proof of his compliance with the conditions of this Act, up to
the time of his death, shall be sufficient to entitle them to the patent.”
Now it will be seen that the law contemplates “a compliance” on the
part of the Settler “with the conditions of this Act, up to the time of
his death.”
M” Reinhardt's Sons were “single” men, and if they complied with
the Conditions of the Act up to the time of their death, their rights
will descend by virture of the Said Act to their heirs, to be held and
divided by them according to the laws of Florida.
Let us see, what these conditions are, bearing in mind that the
Conditions of the Act as applied to general cases, become qualified
by the 5" Sec" of it, when particular cases arise like these in question,
where the settler dies before the expiration of the first year from the
date of his permit.
The Sons of M* Reinhardt “Single” men over 18 years of age, able
to bear Arms, had permits issued to them as aforesaid, on the ground
of their coming within the purview of the 1* Condition or Stipulation
of the Act the 2" Condition or Stipulation requires, “that said settler
shall reside in the Territory of Florida, South of said Township line,
for five consecutive years, and to take his grant on any public land
South of that township.”
Apply the 5* Section of the Act, and this condition is qualified so
as to require his residence as indicated up to the time of his death.
The 3" Condition or Stipulation is “that said settler shall erect
thereon a house fit for the habitation of man, and shall clear, enclose,
and Cultivate at least five acres of Said land, and reside thereon for
the space of four years next following the first year after the date of
his permit, if he or she shall so long live.”
By the 5* Section of the Act, in connexion with the peculiar cir-
cumstances of the present case, the requirement of residence is done
away with, but it is necessary that the residue of the condition as to
the erection of a house, clearing, enclosing and cultivating at least
five Acres should be so far respected as to require some proof that the
deceased had complied with it or manifestly intended to so up to the
time of his death.
The 4* Condition or stipulation is “That such settler shall within
one year after the survey of said lands and the opening of the proper
Office for the entry and sale of the same by the United States, prove
before such tribunal, and in such manner and form as shall be pre-
scribed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, with the
approval of the President, the fact that the Settlement has been com-

menced, and the particular quarter Section upon which it is located;
and also that such settler shall, within Six Months after the expiration
of five years from the date of his permit, prove in like manner, the
fact of continued residence and cultivation, as required in the second
and third Conditions herein above prescribed: Whereupon, and not
until then, a patent shall issue to Said Settler for such quarter
Section.”—
Apply the 5* Section of the Act to this condition in view of the
nature of these cases, and the requirement stands thus
The Heirs of such settler, after shewing that they are such by
evidence Satisfactory to the Register & Receiver (the “tribunal” ap-
pointed to adjudicate in the premises) must shew within a year after
the survey of the lands & opening of the Office “the fact that the
settlement has been commenced, and the particular quarter Section
upon which it is located” and they must “within six months after the
expiration of five years from the Date of his permit prove, in like
manner, the fact of Continued residence” up to his death and manifest
intentions up to that time to comply with the Other conditions “as
required in the Second and third conditions herein above prescribed.”
If M Reinhardt can establish to the satisfaction of the Register
& Receiver, that in the claims of his two Sons, the Conditions of the
Act have been complied with, as explained and applied in the fore-
going to these particular cases, then the rights of the deceased will
descend to their Heirs, & patents will issue accordingly, otherwise not

THOMAS H. DUVAL Esq. Secy of Florida Tallahassee
SIR, I received, to-day, your letter of the 4" inst." inclosing an ex-
tract of yours to the First Auditor of the 23" July.”
That letter, as I understand, was not referred to me, because its
explanations were required in the Auditor's Office, and no action
could be based upon it here, the appropriation being absorbed.
This Department is prohibited by law from entering into any con-
tract, except under a law authorising the same, or under an appropri-
ation adequate to its fulfilment.
Of the appropriation made for pay and milage of the members of
the Territorial Legislature, pay of its Officers, stationery, fuel, print-
ing, and all other incidental and miscellaneous objects, being
$27.125—the sum of $2.945.42 was charged for stationary alone.
Remarks upon such a charge are superfluous—nor is it necessary for
me to suggest the appropriate remedy for such extravagence.
The duty of carefully and economically superintending the disburse-
ment of the funds appropriated by Congress for Territorial expenses,
ought to devolve on the officers appointed and paid by the United
States to protect the public interest. It is impossible for me to under-
take to purchase stationery for the Territorial Legislature of Florida-
or to prescribe the details under which the members may be supplied.
But I can perceive no difficulty in establishing by the officers appointed
by the United States for this and other purposes, such regulations in
regard to Territorial disbursements, as will effectual discourage such

SIR. I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 9"
inst:" which goes so far to inspire the belief, that the charges of fraud
recently made against some of the surveys in your district, will turn
out to be gratuitous.
They were made out in duplicate, one set sent to the Hon: M*
Levy, and the other to this Office, and as the Office was still suffering
great annoyance from one or two similar occurences in other districts,
much magnified by a tardiness in having them corrected, I felt alive
to the responsibility of prompt action.
Should M. Reid sustain himself, as you seem to anticipate, this
office will certainly not be backward in doing him justice, although it
can perceive no cause to regret the course it has pursued. It is of
infinite importance to a country like Florida, in the act of being
settled, to have her surveys clear and undoubted, free from any
just cause of reproach & if possible, above suspicion.”

My object was only to inquire learn if the duties of the Agent of the
Department were understood to extend to the protection of Light
wood, and whether he was acting within the scope of his contemplated
authority, in instituting prosecutions against the citizens of the coun-
try for removing that description of waste wood from public lands.
I was desirous to learn if in the employment of an agent in Florida,
the views of the Department extended beyond the protection of timber
suitable for naval purposes.
It is proper for me to mention that many prosecutions have been
instituted against constituents of mine for alledged trespasses of this
kind, and the vexatiousness to the public of the course pursued upon
that subject has been so great as to elicit complaint & formal present-
ments of grand juries. I desired therefore to invite your attention to
the matter, as it might be that the Agent was going beyond the inten-
tion of the Department; and if so, the necessity of legislation which
might otherwise be asked for would be avoided, by specific instructions.

to justify the arrest and commitment of the Negroes, to the Marshal

to M* Fox that any communication which he might address to the

Bahama Islands. I am directed by the President to authorize and
request you to take all proper steps for reclaiming and bringing back
to the United States the individuals supposed to have been concerned
in the robery and murder above mentioned. For this purpose it will
be messary to repair to Nassau, with as little delay as possible either
in person or by Deputy prepared to prove the identity of the fugitives
in question, and to exhibit such evidence of their criminalty as shall
be deemed sufficient to meet the requirements of the treaty To
enable you so far as this Department is possessed of the means of
doing so, to judge as to the nature and form of testimony to be ad-
duced before the British authorities I transmit to you a printed copy
of the British Act giving effect to the 10" Article of the recent treaty,
together with a copy of a printed paper prepared at this Depart-

attorny of the U States at Key West on the subject of this letter; and
in case any doubts should arise in your mind as to the Course proper
to be pursued in the prosecution of this matter, you will advise with
him concerning it. It would be well to communicate to the Governor
of Florida the substance of this and to request his cooperation, as well
as that of the other civil authorities of the Territory so far as it may
be desirable, in contributing to effect the object in view.”

HON. J. M. PORTER Secretary of War
SIR, Since my last annual report from this office, there have been
removed from Florida to the Indian Territory two hundred and
twelve Indians, who are now subsisting at a daily expense of 7.68%$.
It has happily ceased to be a matter of so much interest as it lately
was, how many or how few have been removed from the Indian
fastnesses in Florida. The war which has so long harrassed the
United States is at an end. Our officers and soldiers, though their
presence in our southern territory is judicious, if not necessary,
are no longer exposed to the hardships of a service that bore upon
them with great severity. The drain upon the Treasury is closed.
Our citizens can sleep in peace and security. A few Indians only
remain in Florida producing no inconvenience by their presence,
the riddance from which is more desirable on account of the ultimate
advantage to themselves, that, must grow out of their removal west,
than from any other reason *

has been lately very extensively cut, one, at least, of these vessels,
the Schooner Louisiana, Charles Marsh master, is, I know, chartered

live oak cut from the public lands, and account for said live oak to the

that I have received no communication from the Department, and
that M* Thistle the live oak agent, is absent from the Territory, I
concluded, on consulting with the District attorney, to send an agent to

SIR, At the last Session of the Legislative Council, two new Coun-
ties were created in this Territory, viz, Wakulla, in Middle, and
Hernando in East Florida, and the election of two additional members
of the Legislature provided for.
This fact was inadvertently overlooked, when the estimate of ex-
penses for the year ending 30 June 1845, was prepared and forwarded
by me on the 13" September last,” and I beg leave now to correct
this omission, by enclosing to you the following estimate,” in addition
to that already sent. As the Act, creating these Counties, was passed
subsequent to that of Congress, making appropriations for the Civil
and diplomatic expenses of Government, for the fiscal year ending
30" June 1844, the pay and mileage of the two additional members,
at the approaching session of our Legislative Council, are altogether
unprovided for.
Is there any mode by which provision can be made to meet this
unforseen contingency?
The account of Edward R. Wellford Esq, late private Secretary to
Gov. Call, has been sent to me by the Hon: David Levy, Delegate
from Florida, in whose hands the same was placed, with a request that
I would include it in the estimate, which I have done, and enclose

V. Y. CONWAY S.G. Tallahassee Florida
SIR. The Navy Department has requested me to cause a survey
to be made, “between the private claims and government lands,
commencing at Lindsay Todd's tract on Spruce Creek, Mosquito
County, Florida, and extending to that of John Andrews, on Indian
River, in the same County, the whole distance of which is represented
to be twenty five miles and forty-five chains, in order that the Agent
for the protection of Live Oak in that Territory, may know what
lands are public and what are private.””
This is part of the land ordered to be Surveyed by my instructions
of the 20" Ult°,” the contracts for which, you advised me on the
4" inst,” would not be given out, till you could ascertain with some
degree of certainty, how much of the $10,000 now applicable to sur-
veys in your District, would remain after settling present liabilities.
There is no doubt but that sufficient will remain, to execute the
Surveys above mentioned, and as it is highly important, that the
public lands should be designated in that region, to enable the Agent
for the protection of Live Oak, to make the necessary reservations of
timbered land, I have to request, that you will immediately contract
for the Survey of the lands embraced within the request of the Navy
Department before quoted, in accordance with the iustructions from
this Office of the 20" Ult° The lands between Washington's con-
tract, marked “A”, and the Atlantic, being Towns: 18 to 22 incl. of
Ranges 34 to 38 inclusive, would, from the information in this Office,
embrace all that is desired by the Navy Department. It may be
necessary, however, to survey Towns 16. of Ranges 33 & 34 to find
“Lindsay Todd's tract on Spruce Creek”, and also to go further South
then Town. 22, on Indian River, to find that of “John Andrews”, and
if so, you will, of course, have such Surveys made. You will take all
the usual and necessary measures, to ascertain what private claims
are in this region, and avail yourself of the information that may be
obtained from the Archives in S*Augustine, for this purpose, and re-
quire that all those claims shall be located in accordance with the
instructions above mentioned. Wherever there is one or more private

claims in a Township, such Township should be subdivided, but it will
not be necessary for the present object, to subdivide those townships
in which there are no private claims. The instructions of the 20th

claims, and in the price that will be allowed for the work. Should it
be found necessary to extend the surveys further North than town-

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF THE
TERRITORY
[NA:HF, 27 Cong., 3 sess:DS]
[November, 1843]
To the Honorable the House of Representatives of the United States in
Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the undersigned Citizens of the United States
and inhabitants of the Territory of Florida, respectfully represents;
That your memorialists, upon the election of David Levy as Delegate
to the last Congress, fully believing then, as they do now, that the
said David Levy was, and is an Alien, and therefore not eligible to a
seat in your honorable body, or entitled to represent Citizens of the
United States; addressed a respectful protest of remonstrance against
his admission into Congress as their Delegate. This memorial was
referred to the committee on Elections, and a mass of testimony,–
much of it irrelevant, and taken ex parte by the said David Levy
without notice to the remonstrants, and in direct violation of the
rule adopted by the committee prescribing the mode in which
testimony should be taken in the case, was received and printed.
Upon this testimony,–a considerable portion of which as your
memorialists are thoroughly convinced, was introduced for no other
purpose, than to mystify an otherwise plain and clear case, -
conflicting reports were made by different portions of the committee.
Owing to a great press of important business in the House, or from
some other cause, no definite action upon the question of M* Levy's
Alienage was had.
This question so deeply involving the inherent and inalienable
political rights and privileges of your memorialists, they respectfully
* Answered Dec. 16, 1843 (NA, GLO Lets from SG, Fla.). Cf. post, p. 811.

pray, may be again taken up by your honorable body and definitively
settled. They cannot doubt that the testimony already taken in the
case, pertinent to, and bearing upon the point at issue, will, if
divested of the great accumulation of irrelevant matter which
encumbers it, amply sustain them in their remonstrance.
M. David Levy claims to be a Citizen of the U. States in right of
his father Moses E. Levy; upon the assumed ground, that the said
Moses E. Levy was in Florida at the time of the final transfer and
surrender of the Floridas to the Government of the United States—
to wit, on the 17" day of July 1821—and thus became a citizen, in
virtue of the Treaty of Cession.—Your memorialists confidently take
the opposing ground, in which they feel that they are indisputably
borne out by the testimony already adduced,—and which they are
prepared to strengthen, if need be, by other and conclusive
documentary evidence,—that the said Moses E. Levy was in the
city of Charleston State of South Carolina, on the 17" day of July
1821. and did not arrive in Florida,—for the first time—until the 25th
day of that Month.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Secretary’s Office TALLAHASSEE Dec 10” 1843
SIR, A sincere desire to see the expenses of our Territorial Gov-
ernment, limited to what was reasonable and proper, induced me to
address you on the 4” ultimo," and make a suggestion with regard to
the future purchase of Stationery for the use of the Legislative Council.
Your reply" contained a reflection upon the conduct of the Ex-
ecutive officers of the Territory, which, permit me to Say, I do not
think is deserved. As an act of justice to Gov. Call, I will state that
he vetoed the appropriation Bill, as it was first passed at the last
Session of the Legislative Council, solely on the ground of its ex-
travagance, and only signed it, after the amount allowed for Sta-
tionery and printing, had been stricken out.
Speaking of the officers appointed by the United States, and allud-
ing, I presume, to the Governor & Secretary, you are pleased to remark
in the conclusion of your letter, that “no claim becomes a charge
upon the appropriation, until it has been adopted by those officers,
and received their express Sanction”—To this, so far as it was intended
to apply to the Secretary, I be leave to reply, that among the duties
of that officer, as prescribed by the various acts of Congress, I know
of none which require or authorize him, either to give or withhold
his sanction to any item of the appropriations made by the authority
of the Territorial Legislature. Nor do I know, in what way you
consider his sanction as expressed, unless the giving of the usual
certificate, under the Seal of the Territory, for a claim allowed by an
Act of the Legislative Council, is regarded as such. If this be so, I
can only Say, that under such circumstances, I have never supposed
that the Secretary had a right to withhold his certificate; for whether
it is given or not, every such claim, under the provisions of the Act
of Congress, approved August 29*1842," must be audited and settled

by the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, and who, in

If the Department, however, is of opinion, that my certificate,
for any claim allowed by the Legislative Council, is such a Sanction
of that claim, as to render it a charge upon the appropriation, and
will instruct me to withhold it, if, in my opinion, such claim is ex-
travagant, I will, for the future, take care to act under such instruction.

on the afternoon of the 19th. and immediately commenced the survey
of the neck of land dividing Indian River and Mosquito South Lagoon
with a view to determine the practicability of cutting a canal to con-
nect the waters of the two streams, and thus remove the great source
of toil and difficulty experienced by all settlers and others passing
from North to South by the inland route from Smyrna to the mouth
of Indian River—-

By an inspection of the Map of Florida it will be seen that there
is a direct inland route by water from the mouth of Mosquito River
three miles from Smyrna, running parallel to the Atlantic Ocean by
means of Mosquito and Indian Rivers with the exception of a narrow
neck of land separating the two at a point designated on the Map
as Fort Ann. At this point, for years previous to the war, Indians,
traders and others were compelled to haul over their canoes, goods
and supplies from one stream to the other, when an interupted navi-
gation again presents itself running, in seasons of high water almost
entirely to Key Biscayne. During the progress of the war lately
brought to a close a large force of regulars and militia varying from
800 to 1000 men was stationed for some weeks at this point with a
view mainly to assist in forwarding supplies of provisions forage and
materials required by the Army operating on the main land to the
Westward, these supplies &c. &c. being brought a few miles South of
Smyrna in transports and steamboats, afterwards taken in small
boats & scows to the “Haulover” and thence carried by wagons
across the to Indian River, to be thence again boated across to the main
land and down the river in the direction of Fort Pierce. I have no
data at my command at present upon which to base a calculation of
the expense of this kind of transportation, but from the large force
so long employed there, the wagons, mules & necessary forage, to-
gether with the supplies for the troops, to say nothing of the neces-
sity of the withdrawal of such a force from the fighting strength
actually in the field, I hazard little in asserting that the expense of
keeping up such a force to overcome the difficulty arising from the
interposition of this narrow neck of land must have cost the Govern-
ment in six months twenty times the expense of cutting a canal from
one stream to the other, and thus dispensing with the great expense
of transporting forage and supplies for the teams & men required to
forward provisions, amunition, &c &c to the Army on the main land,
besides relieving from such harassing service a large body of troops
and rendering them available for actual service in the field. Since
the termination of the war this has been the general route for all
settlers on Indian River St. Lucie, Key Biscayne & Lake Worth.
The bar at the mouth of Indian River does not admit at high tide
the passage of vessels drawing more than eight feet; this together
with the dangerous nature of the bar itself, shifting its position at
every gale or long continuance of heavy weather, the absence of pilots,
and exposed during the prevailing Easterly winds to the whole sweep
of the broad Atlantic, renders the inland communication preferable
at all seasons, notwithstanding the time and labor lost in hauling
over land the boats & supplies of those seeking lands & settlements
in the Southern portion of the Territory. Hence the necessity and

policy of removing this obstruction, and rendering the navigation for
small vessels open and uninterupted from the head of Bulow's creek
falling at a distance of 12 miles into Halifax river, thence to Smyrna
35 miles, to the Haulover 30 miles, to Indian River bar 80 and at
high water by means of canoes & light draught boats thro’ the passes
in the everglades to Lake Worth and Key Biscayne, a distance alto-
gether from the head of Bulows creek of near 250 miles. With this
pass opened and made to admit the passage of boats and scows draw-
ing not more than three feet water there will be no difficulty of moment
in the way of settlers desirous of locating on the rich lands on Indian
River & St. Lucie, well adapted for the cultivation of sugar, cotton,
tobacco & the various kinds of tropical fruits comprising oranges,
limes, lemons, pine apples, bannanas, plantains, yams &c &c &c. and
blessed with a climate remarkable for health, but now rendered almost
useless & bearing but a nominal value will thus immediately present
itself as a highly desireable region for those wishing settlements in
the South and only now deterred from immediate location by the
difficulty of getting there & the still greater difficulty of sending the
products of their labor to market when once located. With these
considerations in view, tending to advance the rapidity of settlement
of the country, increasing ten fold the actual value of the lands, the
mere expense of constructing the canal is of little moment the more
especially as with the application of the proposed means of construc-
tion this expense will be so light as hardly to be felt by the treasury
of the government in its most exhausted condition.
From the survey just completed a map of which accompanies this
report, * it appears that the distance across from Indian River to
Mosquito South Lagoon, is by careful measurement 725 yards, rising
abruptly at a distance of 150 yards from Indian river to 8% feet at the
highest point of land above the level of the water, thence gradually
descending to 6 feet, 525 yards from the same point, again abruptly
descending in the space of 100 yds to the level of the water in the two
streams, with a narrow ridge of 1% feet separating the peninsula from
Mosquito River—Four hundred yards of this distance from Indian
River is through a bed composed of a covering of 1% feet of red sand,
3 feet of hard coquina and the remainder of the distance to the bot-
tom of the canal thro' shell & sand easily yielding to the pick & a
bed of small shell as readily yielding to the Spade. Through this
distance an ordinary excavation of the required depth to give 4 feet
to the depth of the canal is all that is requisite—A section of the
canal thro’ this portion of the work is exhibited on the map in the
section through E. F.—

The remaining distance 300 yds is composed entirely of white
sand; in digging down to the level of the water in the two streams
the sand mixed up with water partakes of the character of quicksand,
the excavation filling up almost as soon as made, and the banks
constantly liable to fall in. In order to guard against such fatal
results, it is proposed to box in the entire distance thro’ the quick
sand by driving piles 8 inches square & 12 feet in length, at a distance
of 12 feet apart, revetting the sides with two inch plank, and to
remove every possibility of the canal filling up either by the falling
in of its banks or by the pressure of the sand & water at the sides of
the canal forcing up the sand from the bottom it is also contemplated
to cover the bottom with two inch plank in such a manner as to
render the whole free from all liability to fill up & the canal at all
times passable. The proposed plan of construction in detail of this
part of the work is shown in the section through C. D., a longitudinal
& transverse section of which is given. For the determination of
the nature of the soil and material through which the canal is de-
signed to pass, several shafts were sunk exhibited on the “Profile of
the Ground” across the Peninsula; 100 yds through the marsh or
Lagoon of the 300 considered as quick-sand is on the same level as
the water of Mosquito river, a mere excavation four feet deep may
be here all that is necessary, although I have estimated with a view
of revetting the sides and covering the bottom of the whole 300 yds
with two-inch plank. It will be seen from an inspection of the map
that from the Eastern termination of the canal in Mosquito river
to the channel of the river there is a distance of about 300 yds gradually
deepening from the shore to 2 feet in depth at the edge of the channel;
the mere deepening of this part of the work will not require much
labor, although it will, unless revetted, be at all times liable to fill
up; nevertheless, it is believed, that the constant passage of boats,
and the nature of the bottom, grass & soft mud with patches of sand,
together with the current formed by the difference of level in the
water of the two streams, depending entirely upon the nature &
direction of the winds, will with slight difficulty keep open a passage
sufficient for boats drawing from 2 to 3 feet water.
It is now proposed to open this canal by such a force as can be
spared for the purpose, taken from the troops stationed at St. Francis
Barracks, and with the assistance of such means as are at the disposal
of the Quarter masters and Commissary Departments at this station,
provided the requisite authority can be obtained for such a disposition
of the troops—The following estimate of expense of construction
is based upon this supposition.

posable for the purpose the work could be completed in two months
after breaking ground, and at the cost of about $4000—Without
such assistance owing to the necessity for the employment of a suitable
vessel, the large force requisite to transport the supplies and materials
to the Haulover, the difficulty and expense of hiring the requisite
teams, the cost of purchasing tools and the pay of a large force of
mechanics and laborers for perhaps a much longer period, the canal
could not be constructed at an expense of less than $10,000–

As there is however no appropriation to which it can be charged ex-

Secretary of War, for which purpose full explanations of all the cir-
cumstances rendering the expenditure necessary will have to be
produced, and which you are requested to furnish. So long as there
was a general appropriation for preventing and suppressing Indian

SIR, The schooner Ellen, between 40 and 50 tons burthen, Reuben
Tripp Jr. master, cleared at this port sometime in the month of July
last, with a Cargo of Lumber for Nassau N. P. After landing some
passengers on the Florida Coast at Indian River, she proceeded on her
voyage, and sometime in the month of August following she appeared
off Indian River Inlet and came in over the bar. Her cargo consisted
of Salt, Sugar and Coffee The whole of the salt was landed and a part
of the Sugar and Coffee and left there. While in the River the U.S.
Revenue Cutter, Crawford, Capt Day, hove in sight, when a manifest
was made out on board the Ellen setting forth the remainder of the
Sugar and Coffee but making no mention of the Salt. The boat of the
Cutter came in and boarded the Sch" Ellen, and the first or second
Lieut. of the Cutter after examining her papers, hold &c. enclosed a
copy of the manifest as exhibited and directed it to the “Collector of
the Customs, Jacksonville E. F.” and gave the same to one of the
Passengers, M*Kinney by name, for delivery. The Sch" Ellen after

taking in some 12 or 14 passengers then proceeded on her voyage to
Jacksonville where she arrived near the latter part of August, in the
evening, and during the night the sugar and Coffee on board was
landed and stored, a small portion of it having been left at St. Johns'
Bar on her way up the River.—The officer of the Customs did not
board her on her arrival at the wharf, and perhaps not during the next
day. Thus was the revenue of the U.S. defrauded thro’ the neglect of
the Officers appointed for its protection. These facts can be proved
by the following testimony—The log Book of the Cutter Crawford
for the month of August, by W* D. Ward of Indian River, Mills O.
Burnham, of Do. Frederic Weedon, of Do. W." Burnham of Jackson-
ville, Geo. M. Barnes of Do. C. S. Emery of Do. and Lewis Mallory of
Charleston S C.
In calling the attention of the Department to the above facts, I
wish to make a futher statement.
The Public Interest requires the appointment of some Efficient
Officer of the Customs at this port,
1* Because, the present Collector (thro’ leave of absence granted on
account of ill health,) has for some time past, and still is away from
this place, having considerable planting interests in the interior say
some 70 or 80 miles distant, and does not come here only once in two
or three months.
2" The present Deputy Collector (acting also as Inspector) has
been absent from this place and at the North some 3 or 4 months,
and now since his return from ill health is unable to attend to any
business, and this is likely to continue so.
3" Because during the absence of the Collector, Deputy Collector &
Inspector, the duties of the Office devolved on W* B. Ross and Thomas
O. Holmes merchants of this place, the former being absent most of
the time and the latter too much engaged in Mercantile business to
discharge the duties of Sub Deputy Collector & that thereby the public
interests have suffered.
4" Because during the absence of the Collector, the Deputy Col-
lector has not with sufficient promptitude and despatch discharged
the duties of his office.
5"And because, if the Revenue has been defrauded in the manner
before specified, it is more than probable it will occur again, there
being many steam-saw-mills in this section on the river and numerous
cargoes of Lumber shipped to the West Indies, which are exchanged
there for articles paying duty in the U. S. and brot to this port.
I would wish to draw the attention of the Department to the fact,
that on account of the facilities afforded to the smuggling of contra-
band articles, and particularly Cigars of Spanish Manufacture, at
Indian River Inlet and Gilberts Bar from their contiguity to the West

Cutters along the coast should be afforded. A large portion of this
interesting country having been recently settled under the “Armed
Occupation act.” It is believed that extensive operations are in con-
templation to avoid the Revenue Law at these places.
I am aware that there have been many applications for the Office of
Collector of this port, should a vacancy occur, nevertheless, from the
fact of having been recomended by our late Delegate the Hon.
Charles Downing dec" and the determination that the abuses that
have grown out of the late administration of the Office should be
corrected, and its duties promptly and efficiently performed if those
in charge of the public interests should see fit to appoint me, induce me

myself entitled upon every principle of Justice and equity to Fifteen
hundred dollars for the present year & there is and can be no reason
why the attorney who may defend them during the ensuing year
should not receive the same amount, or why the assistant counsel
should not be also paid, these claims are of too much moment to the
Government to be lightly regarded or carelessly or inattentively
managed, to their proper and efficient defence, a due degree of experi-
ence and close attention are requisite, & this can hardly be afforded,
or expected, without compensation, so far as it may be in your power
to aid in procuring the proper appropriation for this object; you will

heretofore respecting the employment of assistant Counsel.” Do
make them understand as you well Know that there is necessity for
such Counsel. Any one man in Florida would be overborne by the
efforts legitimate and illegitimate which will be made in this case by
Call and his set. M. Westcott aided me in the Court of Appeals and
there I succeeded If I have aid below I think I can beat them although
his Excellency may again come into Court and spout and Storm in
propira persona as he did before. M Westcott will aid me whether
the Government pay him or not. You Know our connexion and can
judge why he does so. It is on my account merely. On the first trial
he declined on account of the coolness between him and Call, and Judge
Douglas assigned M. Grattan to help me. The United States refused
to pay him for arguing the case in the District Court and also to pay
M. Westcott $100. for arguing the case in the Court of Appeals I
shall satisfy M. W. out of my own pocket if the Government will not.
I am determined not to be borne down in this case and that the Gov-
ernment shall have justice if it can be got here and I think it can.

jurors and himself and all his friends strain every nerve to carry the
cause out of doors. They denounce it as a Democratic persecution.
You can if you will enlighten M* Spencer and M. Penrose as to this
matter. Just look at the Sett-offs filed by Call. Please see also that
Call & Walker do not do me injustice in any communications they
may make to the federal officers. Call as you Know once before
wrote a base and malicious falsehood (of which too you could testify)
respecting Gov" Read and myself to the Secretary of the Treasury and
he is entirely capable of doing it again. He slandered me before be-
cause of my doing my duty without regard to his notions He was
exceedingly hostile because he was indicted for erecting a nuisance—
his Lake Iamona Dam which I presented by instruction of the Grand
Jury. I entertain no ill feeling towards him but I will go straight
forward in all matters where he is concerned and not suffer him or
G. K. Walker to wander a hairsbreadth from the truth nor extend to
them any thing not demanded by strict laws
There is nothing new here except the project of a new Chancery
Court which excites considerable interest. I believe the object is to
have a special Court to wind up the Banks in Chancery so say West-
cott Baltzell and Brockenbrough to the Democrats and the Bankites
go for it because it makes an office. Randall Thompson and half a
dozen others are supposed to be Seeking for it—Dont give it to any of
them. If any Floridian in the District gets it I am next in the official
ranks after Judge Douglas but if you will Send us a good firm anti-
bankite who will do something I will give way. Westcott Baltzell or
Brockenbrough would not have it if you made the Salary $3.000

letter no censure upon the Governor and Secretary of the Territory.
None was intended—but there certainly are suggestions made as to
the duties of those officers which your appeal seemed to require under
existing laws. The Act of 29"August, 1842,” prohibits any payment
on account of Territorial expenses, unless the Secretary of the Treasury
shall have estimated therefor, and the object been approved by
Congress. The estimates submitted by this Department for the
expenses of your Territory, are made up on the statement of officers
appointed and paid by the United States to protect the public inter-
ests—particularly the Governor and Secretary.

No account for disbursements in the Territories can be settled and
adjusted by the accounting Officers, until it has first been estimated
for by the officers of the Territory, submitted by this Department,
and approved by Congress.
It is clearly the duty of the Territorial officers to see that the money
appropriated by Congress upon their own estimates, is applied to
those purposes and no other. The certificates issued under the Seal
of the Territory, sanction the expenditures therein expressed. To
issue them for expenditures beyond, or for objects not contemplated
in the estimates and the appropriation of Congress, and which cannot
be paid here except by a violation of the laws, would be an act of bad
faith towards innocent holders of such certificates, should they happen
to be assigned to them & received in ignorance that they had been
issued without legal authority and without means of payment.
I think, therefore, that the act in question supersedes the necessity
for further instructions in regard to certificates under the seal of the
Territory, and must beg to repeat the suggestion which concludes my
letter of the 16" Nov. respecting the regulation of Territorial
disbursements.

Collectors office DISTRICT OF APALACHICOLA Dec. 21. 1843
SIR I have this day received your letter of the 9" instant.” At
the time I addressed your predecessor a year ago, in relation to the
Port of St. Joseph it had ceased to be a place of business, as the Rail
Road had been removed, on which it depended entirely for communi-
cation with the River and interior country. I so stated in a letter to
the Delegate from Florida with the explanation that Congress would
make it a Surveyors Port, and thereby reduce the expenses of the
District Nothing was done, and I accordingly addressed you on the
23" ult" for the purpose of obtaining your instructions.
There is no business of any description at St. Joseph and nearly
the whole population have abandoned the place. only two or three
families remaining. But as it was the opinion of our merchants that
St Joseph would offer inducements for smuggling if left without an
officer, I did not feel at liberty to withdraw the Inspector or dismiss

him, Untill I should receive instructions, from the Department I
do not think it at all necessary for the protection of the Revenue
that an Officer should any longer reside at St. Joseph, as I think that
any attempt to evade the laws by introducing Goods through that
Port would be made known to this office. But as the Inspector has
remained till the present time employed as he supposed by Govern-
ment he will expect his usual compensation to the time of dismission.
I shall notify W. D. Price, the Inspector, at St Joseph that his pay
will be discontinued at the close of this quarter.

DEAR SIR. The office of Inspector of the Customs at this Port
having been discontinued by the Secretary of the Treasury without
the appointment of any officer in lieu thereof, We would respectfully
request you to use your influence, bothe with the head of the
Treasury, and if necessary on the floor of Congress in obtaining for
Our Port a Surveyors rank on as favourable terms as possible,
although no duties have been collected here for the last year or likely
to be for some time to come. Still the facilities for smugling and
transportation of merchandise over a good road of only six miles to
the waters of the Apalachicola must without the constant presence
of a Custom House officer lead to an illicit trade, alike pregudicial
to the revenue and the fair dealer. Should a Surveyors Port be
established, We beg leave to recommend William D Price the late
Inspector, for the appointment to be made *

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE MAYOR AND ALDER-
MEN OF THE CITY OF ST. AUGUSTINE
[NA:HF, 28 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred December 28, 1843]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled:
The Memorial of the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of St. Au-
gustine Respectfully sheweth:
That at the transfer of the Floridas to the United States, from the
King of Spain, the Governor of the Province of East Florida rendered
to the American Commissioner a Schedule of the Public Property,
which Schedule included all those Lots and Buildings that had been
set apart for public uses, connected with the wants and convenience
of the inhabitants of the City of St. Augustine: and for the better
information of your Honorable Body a Certified Copy of this Sched-
ule, and a translation thereof is hereunto annexed, marked A *
That upon the cessation of the Spanish jurisdiction, the means of
sustaining the Local Institutions of the City, which had been hitherto
liberally and freely afforded to the inhabitants thereof, by the Span-
ish Government also ceased—the Public School established and sus-
tained by the King was discontinued; and all the public property, as
shown by the aforesaid Schedule, was taken possession of by the
military authorities of the United States:
That soon after the transfer of the Floridas to the United States,
they were united under a Territorial Government—the Civil laws which
had hitherto prevailed in the two provinces, were repealed; and a
re-organization of the Government of the City of St. Augustine, con-
formable to our Republican Institutions took place. The Act for
that purpose was approved 13" September, 1822,” and empowered
the Corporate authorities amongst other things, to provide for the
Establishment and Superintendence of Public Schools:
* Present. Cf. ante, XXII, 200–205.
* Fla., Acts, 1822, pp. 86–87.


## p. 820 (#836) ############################################

820 T E R R IT OR I. A L P A P E R S
That the clause thus early introduced into the City Charter under the
new order of things, demonstrated most clearly, the public feeling on
the subject of primary education; and so greatly do your Memori-
alists estimate its benefits, that nothing, in their opinion can justify
any integral portion of a free government in not making ample pro-
vision therefor, but the absolute want of means to effect it.
And your Memorialists further shew, That whilst the Provinces
remained under the Sovereignty of the King of Spain, a Public School
House was provided at his expense: That this House and the Lot on
which it Stands, forms the “Third” item in the Schedule above re-
ferred marked A.: and that on the organisation of the Board of Land
Commissioners for the District of East Florida, under the Act of Con-
gress of 3" March 1823,” and the several Acts amending the same,
this Building and the Lot were claimed by the Congregation of the
Roman Catholic Church, and decreed by the Acts of that Board,”
as rightfully belonging to it:
That the Cabildo (being a body composed of the Governor and
other officers of the King, and of other members elected by the inhab-
itants of the City) held its meetimgs at the Exchequer, Treasury and
Custom House Buildings, where the Governor resided; and at the
transfer, these buildings and their lots were held possession of by the
Collector of the Customs of the United States, and were used as a
Custom House and Stores, until the year 1825 when they were
destroyed by fire, and have remained in that dilapidated state eversince.
That the Lot and Buildings, indicated as the Sixth item, in the
Said Schedule, was by the Said Board of Commissioners divided, and
the one moiety thereof declared to be private property: and the
other moiety thereof has remained in the possession of the City Au-
thorities, on the admitted ground that under the Spanish Sover-
eignty, this property was more immediately devoted to City uses,
but the title thereof is nominally in the United States.
And your Memoralists further shew, That by an Act of the Con-
gress of the United States, approved 8" February 1827, entitled “An
Act to provide for the Confirmation and Settlement of private Land
Claims in East Florida, and for other purposes,” did confirm the
Commons in the City of St. Augustine to the Corporate Authorities
thereof, to the same extent that they were enjoyed under the Spanish
Government; and by the same act did also confirm the Parochial
Church and Burying Grounds to the Congregation of the Roman
Catholic Church; and the “Old Episcopal Church Lot” indicated in
853 STAT. 750–754.

## p. 821 (#837) ############################################

FL OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 821
the Schedule under the head of “Lots,” was confirmed to the “in-
corporated Episcopal Church of St. Augustine.”
That by an Act of Congress, entitled “An Act making provision for
the Sale and disposition of the Public Ground in the Cities of St.
Augustine and Pensacola, and to reserve certain Lots and Buildings
for Public purposes, and to Provided for their repair and preserva-
tion,” approved 28* June 1832,” the said Congress did vest in the
Mayor of the City of St. Augustine and his Successors in Office, in
Trust, the title to the “Old Burnt Hospital Lot” indicated in the
Schedule referred to, as the “Fifth” item, for the necessary buildings
“for Educating free white Children of both Sexes;” and by the same
Act did direct “that the Lots, Buildings and Commons, not set apart
or needed for Public purposes shall at such time and in such pro-
portions and sizes as may be deemed most advisable and conducive
to the interests of the United States and the said Cities (St. Augustine
and Pensacola) be sold at Public Auction, and the money arising from
the sales paid into the Treasury of the United States.
And your Memorialists further shew, That they deem it incon-
sistent with the just claims which they have upon the Fostering Con-
sideration of the Congress of the United States, as well as incom-
patible with the spirit which should exercise its government, that
such a disposition should be made of the unoccupied Lots and Build-
ings, remaining as Public, within the Chartered Limits of the City of
St. Augustine; especially, as it will be taking away every means of
revenue from one of the Oldest Cities on the Atlantic Coast: and it
seems to your Memoralists, that after an existence of so many ages,
its inhabitants should not, by a change of their Sovereignty, be left
without the means of providing for, and of sustaining the institutions
incident to their new relations and necessary to render them useful
members of a free Government, by the most suitable moral and
intellectual cultivation.
and your Memorialists further shew, That the Corporate Author-
ities, since the Act of 1832 have not been able to Erect the Buildings
contemplated in that Act, for the want of the necessary funds; nor
have they been yet able to secure the means necessary to establish
Primary Schools, in consequence of the great and severe difficulties
to which their constituents have been exposed by the Indian
depredators.
Your Memorialists therefore pray, That your Honorable Body
would repeal so much of the Act of 28" June, 1832, as directs the
sale of the Lots, Buildings and Commons referred to, and the dis-
position of the proceeds; and that the title to the Lot indicated as
884 STAT. 550–551.

the “Sixth” item in the aforesaid Schedule be vested in the City Cor-
porate Authorities of St. Augustine, for City purposes; and that all
the other Lots with their Buildings, as in the opinion of the President
of the United States are not needed for military purposes be vested
in the said Corporate Authorities, to be disposed of as they shall
see fit, to enable them to Erect the necessary Buildings, and to form
a Fund for the Establishment and support of Schools for the Educa-
tion of white Children of both Sexes: and that the water Lots and
waste Lands to low water mark, the benefits of which hitherto enured
to the inhabitants of the City, for grazing lands and various other
purposes, be also ceded to the Local Authorities for such general
purposes as may be for their general and mutual benefit; and also,
that the Streets, Lanes, alleys and By-Paths, within the said Cor-
porate Limits, as they existed under the Spanish Jurisdiction, be
also vested in the said Corporate authorities for the perpetual use
of the inhabitants of said City.
And your memorialists, relying upon the known liberality and
justice of the Congress of the United States, and respectfully referring
to the various Acts of your Honorable Body establishing precedents
in like cases, and especially to an Act entitled “An Act granting to the
Corporation of Tuscaloosa certain Lots and Privileges over the reser-
vation and commons in said Town,” approved 26" May, 1824 *—
an Act Entitled “An Act granting certain grounds in the City of
Detroit to the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen and Freeman thereof,”

further supplemental to the Act entitled “An Act making further
provision for settling the claims to Lands in the Territory of Mis-
souri” passed the 13" day of June, 1812 approved 27" January,
1831." Referring also, to the annexed documents, being the afore-
said Schedule A and its translation; surveys of the several Lots

SIR, A few days since I learned that it was the intention of the
Department to abolish the Office of Inspector at S*Joseph.”
It is true business has ceased and there are in are few, if any,
vessels entering that port, but I think the interests of Government
require an officer there of some kind—
You are probably aware, that the Port of St Joseph is of all the
harbors in the Gulf of Mexico most easy of ingress and egress and
admits merchant vessels of the heaviest class—Our foreign trade is
increasing, and especially with Cuba—There can be little doubt but
that Smuggling would be carried on to a great extent in the harbour
of St Joseph, if there is no Officer of Gover" there to protect its
interests.—At any rate, I should suppose the best plan to continue
the present office, till some action of Congress, making it a surveyors
district—
Feeling the utmost confidence in the views as expressed above
let me request you to see the Secretary upon the Subject.—

SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your com-

Ways & Means have enquired of you “whether the keepers of the
archives in Florida may not be dispensed with by requiring some of
the public Officers of the Territory, say the Secretary, or one of the
Registers of the Land Offices to take charge of these archives? or if
both the keepers can not be dispensed with, might not one of them
by a transfer of the whole of the archives to one place?”—and re-
questing my “views upon these questions that they may be sub-
mitted in reply to the enquiries of the Committee.”
In regard to the subject of enquiry, I herewith enclose a copy of
my letter of the 5" of January last to your predecessor,” and respect-
fully submit as the result of further consideration, that public con-
venience in the present localities, & the familiarity of the keepers
of the archives with the existing arrangement of the papers present
reasons for the continuance of the present Officers. I could not
recommend the transfer of those papers to the Secretary of the
Territory, an Officer not responsible in any way to the Department,
nor subject to its instructions, nor do I think it would be proper to
transfer the archives to the Register.
I feel bound to state however that it would facilitate the surveys
of the private land claims to consolidate the two Offices under one
keeper at the same place at which the Surveyor Generals Office is
established (S" Augustine, Flor.), & place the keeper by law under
the control of this Office for reasons appearing in the enclosed copy
of my letter to your predecessor.”

requests me to recommend him to you for reappointment to his old
office which he is informed will be vacated by the present incumbent
Walker Anderson Eq" who is about to remove to Mobile. Mr Walker
resigned the office of Dist Atty some years since” and removed to
Jackson County Florida where he has since been engaged in the prac-
tice of the law. The extreme unhealthiness of his location will force
him to abandon it; and he is extremely anxious to return to Pensacola.
Mr Walker was decidedly the most able and popular Dist Atty in the
Territory. His reappointment to his old office will give general sat-
isfaction. The office is scarcely worth having but Mr Walker is a
singular man of retired habits, and assures me that the President
could not confer a greater favour on him than by appointing him to
this little office in the quiet town of Pensacola, which he says was in-
tended for him from the beginning. I consider M. Walker as peculi-
larly entitled to the patronage of the government, not only on account
of the able and faithful performance of the duties of his late office,

1843"—Not knowing the precise reason why the number of Cases
pending &c was required to be stated; I have included all that were
upon the respective dockets at the Several terms embraced within
the period covered by these accounts [including the Cases between
private individuals]" although I have received fees during that time
in but very few of them: in Civil cases between individuals in the
Territory there are no attorneys fees taxed: in criminal cases the Dis-
trict Attorneys are entitled to a fee for every indictment “found a

sooner paid for, because the Marshal had not funds wherewith to
pay them; indeed even now he is our of funds, and the items for fees
in these accounts, altho' stated because they accrued during the
respective periods which they embrace remain unpaid; this, together,
with the withholding of my Extra Compensation for defending Suits
instituted under the Acts of Congress of 26 May 1828" and 28 May
1830 * on claims to land, operates a most Serious inconvenience to
me. The duties of District Attorney are in this district exceedingly
arduous, owing to the vast amount of criminal & other public business
constantly accruing [the incumbent of the office here being Attorney
as well for the Territory as for the United States]" while the fees bear
no proportion to the time he has to spend, and the labour he has to
perform: I have been compelled to give up a large portion of my pri-
vate practice, that I might devote the necessary time to my public
duties: these privations are therefore the more injurious to me: There
yet remain on the docket ten of these land cases, embracing about
four hundred thousand acres: besides several that have been remanded
by the Supreme Court, which will be docketed & require the Action
of our Court and the Attention of Counsel during the current year &
others will probably be filed.
No appropriations having been made at the last Session of Con-
gress to pay this “Extra Compensation” although the Service was
required by the law, and the instructions of the President;—was
necessary to the public interest; and has been unremittingly per-
formed: I shall be greatly obliged if you Sir, will take the proper
measures to procure an appropriation for this object, at the present
Session; and I would with all due respect suggest that this appropri-
ation ought to be sufficient to pay the Extra Compensation for the
year 1843 and '44;" and also to pay the Services of Gov" Duval the
assistant Counsel for the same time if he shall (as I think he ought to

SIR, I have the honor to inform you that in pursuance of instruc-
tions from your predecessor, and on complaint of the officers in com-
mand at Forts Brooke & King in this Territory, I have removed a
number of intruders on the Military reservations, around those posts.
One of the persons, a man by the name of Helfer, who was removed
at the earnest & reiterated request of Gen Worth, was exceedingly
contumacious: and after giving him repeated notice, and ample time,
to remove quietly, I was obliged at last to call for aid from the post–
Fort King—and remove his effects as the law directs.
He has since, at the instigation as I think, of other “pestilent fel-
lows,” instituted an action of trespass vs myself, & my deputy who
executed the duty.
As this is a matter of public concernment I respectfully suggest the
propriety of a special order to be issued from the Department to the
U.S. Attorney for this District instructing him to defend the Officers
of the government, and to engage, if he thinks proper, assistant
Counsel.—
As it will be necessary in the defence to shew the authority under
which I acted I must solicit the favor of copies, properly authenticated
for evidence, of the following documents from the files of your office,

HONB' JOHN C. SPENCER Secretary of the Treasury
SIR, On the 1. of March 1840,” I suggested to the Department
that, the Surveyors Office at the Bay of S" Andrews in this District,
might be discontinued without any injury to the public interest.
The judicious remarks contained in your Report to the President,
on the diminution of the expenses of the various Collection Districts,
induces me again to renew the suggestion. There is no business
whatever carried on at S*Andrews Bay, nor is there any prospect in
view, that can justify the continuance of an Officer there; the un-
expected visits occasionally at such places of a Revenue Cutter of
any other public vessel, would be more likely to prevent clandestine
transactions, than the knowledge that there existed a negligent in-
cumbent who could be watched and avoided.

the Secretary of War to communicate to the Senate the correspondence
with General Worth and other Officers relative to fortifying the
Keys and Islands around Cape Florida; and connecting the waters of
Matanzas river and Musqueto Lagoon with Indian river at the
Haulover,” in East Florida & C; as refers to this Office, I have
the honor to submit the following extract from my annual report
made in November 1841: viz,
“In consequence of the heavy losses sustained by the public in
the wreck of vessels transporting supplies to the Military depôts
on the Saint John's in Florida, I consider it my duty, to ask your
attention to the condition of the inland communication from Saint
Mary's in Georgia to the Saint John's. Nature has there performed
most of the work; and had that communication been improved before
the commencement of the Florida War, so as to have been used as
an avenue through which supplies and reinforcements could have
been received, the operations there might have been more efficient,
and a large sum would have been saved in the expenditures. I
recommend that appropriations be asked for, and measures adopted,
to complete the work as soon as practicable.
If the inland communication were continued South from Saint
Augustine to Key Biscayne Bay, the military defence of the Peninsula
would be greatly facilitated. The Atlantic coast of Florida is more
difficult of, and dangerous to, navigation, than any other part of
our coast; and under the most favorable circumstances the supply
of all the posts between the two points mentioned is uncertain. The
inland communication to which I allude, and which I urgently rec-
ommend, can be readily effected, and at comparatively little expense.
Matanzas river could be improved and connected through Grahams
Swamp with Halifax river—that river connects with Musquito Lagoon
at New Smyrna—neither would require much improvement.” The
latter by means of a short canal requiring not more than two locks,
might be connected with Indian River. That river extending South
to Jupiter inlet, more than a degree and a half of latitude, requires
no other improvement than the removal of a few Oyster shoals.
About ten miles south of Jupiter Bay is a lagoon (Bocca Rattone sound)
which could be readily connected with the Bay, and which extends
south to Hillsborough Inlet, at least a degree of latitude. From
Hillsborough Bay to New River Inlet is not more than ten miles,
and between the two points is a lake or pond that could be used in
connecting them—From New River Inlet to Key Biscayne Bay is
not more than eight or ten miles—they could be connected by a canal,

or through New River and the Everglades, which approach within
two miles of the Bay.
In the event of war with either of the great European powers
possessing Colonies in the West Indies, there would be danger of
the Peninsula of Florida being occupied by blacks from the Islands—
A proper regard to the security of our Southern States requires
that prompt and efficient measures be adopted to prevent such a
State of things. Whether the Florida War be terminated during
the next Winter or not, I would recommend that measures be im-
mediately taken to erect permanent works at Key Biscayne, Key
West, and such other points among the Keys, or on the Peninsula,
as on examination may be found to possess the greatest Military
advantages. The timely attention of the Government to that
important object may save a heavy expense as well as avert the
most disastrous consequences.”
I also submit the following extract from my annual report dated
the 25" of October 1843, viz:
“Key West, the Dry Tortugas, and Key Biscayne, are the great
strategic points on our southern frontier; they should be strongly
fortified. Combined with proper naval means, they would command
completely the northern entrance into the Gulf of Mexico, and afford
better protection to the commerce of the whole West and Southwest,
than ten times the force employed at any other points, or in any
other way. To render secure our vast possessions, we must pay
more attention to the principles of strategy. On that subject we
have an admirable lession on the policy adopted and perservered in
by Great Britain. That nation, by its positions, held by a comparatively
small force, has completely checkmated the globe. The three posi-
tions named might be rendered impregnable by an expenditure not
exceeding four millions of dollars. They would be worth, in military
effect, an expenditure of fifty millions.”
The difficulties which I experienced when directing the operations
against the Seminoles in the campaign of 1837–8 in supplying the
division of the Army operating south of the Haulover, on the Atlantic
side of the Peninsula of Florida, enable me to speak with positive
certainty as to the necessity of improving the inland communication
from Saint Augustine to Key Biscayne: and circumstances which
came to my knowledge during the Summer of 1837, show the impor-

tance of fortifying that Key, as well as the other points named.”
In my conferences with the Indian chiefs in 1837, I ascertained
that a constant communication had been kept up between the Semi-
noles and certain persons in the Bahamas, and that most of the negroes
who had eloped from their masters & sought refuge among the Indians
previous to the war had been taken from the Peninsula in British
vessels. Key Biscayne is so situated as to command both Providence
& Florida Channels, and if fortified would put an end to the com-
munication between the Islanders and the blacks on the Peninsula:
and if in addition the other points named were strongly fortified,
we should command completely the outlet from the Gulf of Mexico,
through which the greater portion of our exports necessarily pass.”

JOHN J. ABERT TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:SF, 28 Cong., 1 sess.:LS]
Bureau of Topographical Eng” WASHINGTON Jan' 20" 1844
SIR, In reply to so much of the Resolution of the Senate of the 11th
instant as has been referred to this Office,” namely, that part which
relates to a Rail Road across the isthmus of Florida, I have the honor
to report that no surveys for a work of that kind have been made
under this Bureau. An estimate for such a Survey was submitted to
Congress during its last session, but no appropriation was granted,
and in consequence the Bureau is not in possession of the necessary
elements for an estimate of the cost of constructing the work. Under
these circumstances, I can only present some general but highly
probable average of the cost of the road, derived from experience
under similar conditions elsewhere.
The work is intended to secure the trade of the Gulf of Mexico and
the Atlantic, from the dangers attending upon its present track, as
well as those which emanate from the physical conditions of that
track, as those which would be consequent of a state of hostilities
with some maratime power. It should therefore be built substantially,
of the most suitable materials, and adapted to the immense traffick
which will pass over it. The ground is favorable, requiring no serious
cutting or embanking, or as is believed, the passing of any difficult
swamp; the expenses therefore which usually belong to what is de-
nominated the grading of the road will not be proportionally great;
nor are there any great Rivers to be crossed in the route, or any very
extensive Swamps. Under these views it is supposed that the grad-
ing of the road will not exceed ten, or be less than eight thousand
dollars the mile.
Taking it for granted that suitable timber can be obtained from
the forests of Florida, at the mere expenses of felling and preparing
it, and assuming the iron rail at a weight of not less than sixty pounds
to the running yard, then involving all those considerations of neces-
sary turns out, accidents, and contingencies inseparable from works
of this Kind, I do not feel disposed at placing the expenses for this
part of the road for a single track at less than nine thousand dollars
the mile.
These two items will bring the average cost of the road at from 17
to 19,000 dollars the mile.
It is believed that the best route for the proposed road, will be from
Pilatka on the River St Johns, to Fort Fanning on the Suwannee; but

on this subject, I beg leave to be understood as giving an opinion of
what is probable with our present information. The route in this
direction would be about eighty miles long, which would give for the
probable cost of the road, as one or the other of the previous averages
per mile be taken, one million three hundred and sixty thousand, or
one million five hundred and twenty thousand dollars.
Of course Sir, the foregoing estimate does not involve any of those
considerations which belong to wharves, landings, relay or watering
houses, depots, magazines &c &c, but is confined to what relates
solely to the construction of the road.
The construction of all parts of the road, except that which belongs
to the grading or preparation of the soil, being almost purely me-
chanical, the troops of the United States stationed in Florida, could
be employed to advantage only on the grading. And until the
amount of labor which will constitute the grading be accurately
Known, it is of course impossible to say, what would be the amount
of saving in the employment of the troops. It would however be
the difference, according to the number of laborers required, between
the extra price allowed to the soldier on such duties, about eighteen
cents per day, and the price for hired labor in that Country. It
may however be proper to remark that the invention of excavating
machines, has much reduced the amount of manual labor, heretofore
employed on works of this Kind. There is no doubt however, that
the employment of the troops would be a great saving to the work,
and that the Officers with them would be highly valuable as Assistant
Engineers.”

The intention of this Office has been invariably to restrict the settler
to a technical “quarter section”, such being the language of the
law, to the 2"Section of which I would particularly call your attention.
That section provides “That in case of the settlement of the same
quarter section by two or more settlers the right to the location shall
be determined by priority of settlement . . . and the subse-
quent settler or settlers shall be permitted to locate the quantity, he,
she, or they may be entitled to, elsewhere within the same township
upon vacant public lands.” If Congress had intended to grant to
each settler a location irrespective of the public surveys—the arbi-
trary choice of the area of a quarter section, certainly this language
would not have been used, as there could not possibly have been any
occasion for carrying out such a requirement.
Where the surveys were made prior to the settlement, the settler,
as you perceive is required to designate “the quarter section” for
which he wished a permit.
Where the lands were not surveyed, the settler was to designate
his settlement in the clearest manner possible, by reference to some
well known place, lake, river &c, and when the surveys reached that
settlement, his improvement, field, house, barn &c, were to be indi-
cated in the field notes, & shown on the Official plat of survey by a
dotted or serrated line, in the same manner as the ordinary improve-
ments of pre-emptors are designated, showing the extent of the field,
location of the house, barn &c, and the quarter section upon which
such improvement may be located, is the tract to which the settler
is entitled, and to which he must be restricted.
In cases where the improvements of the settler are in different
quarter sections, he can elect which of those quarter sections he will
take, but if he fail to make such election, the deputy who makes the
survey should designate that as his permit on which his main improve-
ments are located, & the “quarter section” thus indicated as his loca-
tion, should be shaded (not full colored) pink, and have the name of
the settler and number of his permit written on it,-the locality &
extent of his field & the position of his house, barn &c, to be exhibited
as before directed. The whole proceedings, so far as the surveys are
concerned, and the indications on the township maps, will serve as
evidence taken on the ground, of the locations, which will aid in finally
determining “the quarter section” for which the patent may issue
to the settler, & in no case should such locations interrupt the lines
of the public surveys.
Where two or more persons are settled upon the same quarter sec-
tion, that fact should be noted by the Deputy, as directed by me in

the letter of 29" Septr last,” to which I refer you for instructions on
this point. It is not probable that the improvements of the settlers
under the Armed occupation law, have yet been much extended, or
that in a country like Florida, the variation of the lines of the public
surveys a few chains East, West, North or South, from the places
where the settler would desire to have them run will work any injury
to him; and I would regret if it did, but whether or not, the law must
be complied with, and if such an extreme case should occur as that
assumed by you, the party injured would doubtless obtain relief from
Congress.
As you have approved of the mode of surveying these permits in-
dicated by the township plats returned by you, and state that the
deputies have returned their work complete in conformity with the
instructions received from you, it will be necessary to make a new
contract with a Deputy to go into the field and run and mark the
section lines which have been interrupted by the survey of those lo-
cations. This must be done so far as the work has been returned and
approved by you, but where the work has not been completed, sup-
plemental instructions should be sent to the Deputies now in the
field, that they may not fall, into the same error. If this work can
be done for four dollars per mile, it will be paid for out of the general
appropriation for surveying the public lands, but if not, five dollars
per mile may be allowed, and it will be paid for out of the special
appropriation of 3" March 1837, for detached surveys in Florida.

under the Armed occupation Act" should be laid down on the town-

position of the peninsula, of Florida, of the shores of the Gulf of
Mexico from those of the Atlantic; on their distance from the populous
portions of the Atlantic Coast, and from the great naval establish-
ments; on the narrowness of the channels—bordered on one Side by
a foreign shore—through which all the trade of this great gulf
including the immense amount thrown therein by the Mississippi—
must pass; and on other circumstances, unfavorable to Security
in time of War, which are peculiar to that region:—this necessity
has often been brought to the notice of the Government by persons
whose duties were connected with the National defences—and I beg
leave to quote on this Subject from a report made by a Board of
Officers in Feby 1840, as follows—
“The first positions that present themselves, on doubling around
Cape Florida into the Gulf of Mexico, are Key West and the Dry
Tortugas.—
“This Board concur in the opinions heretofore expressed in favor
of these fine harbors; and they beg leave to refer for very interesting
Statements, in relation to the latter harbor especially, to a letter from
Commodore Rodgers to the Secretary of the Navy, July 3* 1829–
(Senate document, 1st: Session 21st Congress, Vol 1, N° 1, page 236)
and letter from the Secretary of the Navy, March 25th 1830–(Senate
documents, 1st: Session 21st Congress, Vol 2, N° 111, page 1)”
“A naval force designed to control the navigation of the Gulf could
desire no better position than Key West or the Tortugas.–Upon the
very way side of the only path through the Gulf, it is, at the Same
time, well Situated as to all the great points therein.—It overlooks
Havana, Pensacola, Mobile, the mouths of the Mississippi, and both
the inlet and the outlet of the Gulf.—”
“The Tortugas harbors, in particular, are said to afford perfect
shelter for vessels of every class, with the greatest facility of ingress
and egress.—And there can be no doubt that an adversary in posses-
sion of large naval means would, with great advantage, make these
harbors his habitual resort, and his point of general rendezvous and
concentration for all operations on this Sea.—With an enemy thus
posted, the navigation of the Gulf, by us, would be immenently haz-
ardous, if not impossible; and nothing but absolute naval superiority
would avail any thing against him.—Mere military means could
approach no nearer than the nearest short of the continent.—
It is believed that there are no harbors in the Gulf at all comparable
with these, that an enemy could resort to with larger vessels.—To
deprive him of these, would, therefore, be interfering materially with
any organized System of naval operations in this Sea.—The defence
of these harbors would, however, do much more than this.—It would

transfer to our own Squadron, even should it be inferior, these most
valuable positions; and it would afford a point of refuge to our navy
and our commerce, at the very Spot where it would be most necessary
and useful.—”
“In this report, already too much extended, we forbear to enlarge
on this topic, merely adding that the complete and certain defence
will not be difficult.—By occupying two, or at most three, small islands
the harbors of the Dry Tortugas—(there being an inner and an outer
harbor) may be thoroughly protected.—The works must be adequate
to resist escalade, bombardment, and cannonade from vessels, and to
Sustain a protracted investment; but as they will not be exposed to
any operation resembling a Siege, there can be no difficulty in ful-
filling the conditions.—They must have capacious Store-rooms, be
thoroughly bomb-proof, and be heavily armed.—”
“The fortifications of Key West Should be of a Similar character.—
“No details can be given until all these positions have been minutely
surveyed with reference to defence.—
“The Sum of $3,000,000. was, Some years ago, assumed by the
Engineer Department as necessary to provide defences for the Tor-
tugas and for Key West; and this estimate may now be taken as
ample.—”
“It may be remarked, as applying to the whole Gulf coast, that,
from the relative geographical position of this part of the Sea board,
and the country interested in its Safety, from the unhealthiness of the
climate, nature of the adjacent country, and mixed character of the
inhabitants, it will be some time before that portion within Supporting
distance, whose welfare may be endangered by an enemy, will be
competent, of itself, to Sustain a serious attack from without.—Upon
the Atlantic Sea board, the Alleganies crowd the people down upon
the Shore; every important point on the coast being Surrounded by
a population dense now, and every day rapidly increasing in numbers;
while the ocean and the interior parallel communications transmit
rapid aid to the right and left.—The coast of the Gulf, however, is
thinly peopled in itself, is remote from Succor from behind, and is
almost inaccessible to lateral assistance.—Those reasons, therefore,
which tend to establish the necessity of an organized, permanent,
and timely System of defence for the whole Sea board of the United
States, apply to this part of it with peculiar force.—”
An estimate for these works was included in the general estimates
for fortifications by the Engineer Department at the close of the year
1835.—
It is understood that the necessity for the occupation of one or both
of these positions is so generally admitted as not to need discussion

in this place; but under this necessity the following questions arise—
1st:—Will it be necessary to occupy both positions?—If not, 2" which
shall be preferred?—3" Is there any other harbor in the reef, or near
it, which, deprived of the other two, an enemy might use for his
own benefit and to our hurt?
These questions involve many considerations which can be brought
satisfactorily and fairly into view—and without the risk of mistake,
only by exact and minute Surveys, and my present object is to solicit
that these Surveys may be entered upon without delay, in order that
the results thereof may be laid before the Board of Engineers for their
assistance in Studying out the appropriate means of defence.—
The proper execution of these Surveys will consume not less than a
year; and by the time the plans of defence founded on the maps of
the Surveys are completed, the fortifications now in progress on the
Gulf Shore will have been so far advanced that a portion of the amount
the Treas'y can annually afford for fortifications may be applied to
the projected works.—
Much time must unavoidably be consumed before the defences
upon these Shoals will be completed:—it is desirable, therefore, that
none be lost.—
Up to the present time, it has been of still greater moment to put
in readiness the immediate defences of the principal objects of at-
tacks:—While New Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola could, themselves,
be reached by the enemy with facility, it would have been unwise to
be continuing distant points of contest with him about the trade of
the two former places and the naval stores of the other.—But the
local defences of these places—especially of New Orleans and Pen-
sacola, are now respectable, and we may begin preparations for works
upon their out posts. I have therefore to desire that there may be
made, as soon as practicable, with a view to the establishment of
permanent defences, the following Surveys—
I. A Survey of the group of islands and Shoals called the Dry
Tortugas.—This Survey Should include the whole cluster; and will
comprise a Space about 14 miles by 8 miles—A rectangular parallelo-
gram of these dimensions, of which the longest sides would have the
direction of about N 59 E. would comprise all that is important—and
in Some parts more than is necessary—No Soundings being required
beyond the line of Six fathoms.—It is hardly necessary to say that
the Survey Should be made with exactness in all respects; and that
the map Should exhibit all the information expected from hydro-
graphic maps of the highest character.—Soundings should be very
numerous, especially off the Shoals; the depths; below low water
written with frequency over every part of the water; the horizontal


## p. 844 (#860) ############################################

844 T E R R I TOR I. A. L. PA P E R S
curves under water drawn for every half fathom of depth, on those
portions of the Shoals that may be occupied for defence, and for every
fathom from the edges of the Shoals out to Six fathoms depth.—The
islands Should be accurately levelled; and, independently of their
delineation on the above mentioned map, there Should be a plan of
each on the Scale of one inch to 50 feet, with the horizontal curves
drawn thereon for every foot in altitude above low water.—Each of
these plans Should contain a Strip of Water Sufficient to indicate
positions for landing places; wharves &c—numerous depths being
given at those places.—
On every position likely to come under consideration as a Site
for a defensive work, whether it be an island or a shol, it would be
very desirable to have the facts as to the nature of the foundation—
whether adequate to Sustain heavy walls, or whether piles, or other
means, might be necessary.—But this information Should be com-
municated in a memoir, with any other matter that the Surveying
Officer might deem important or interesting in relation to the occupa-
tion of this group as a defensive position.—
II.—A Survey of the harbor of Key West. This Survey Should
embrace three or four miles in length of the West end of Key West
island.—There appears to be a kind of channel running through the
main Shoal from the West end of the island, in a northwestwardly
direction, into deep water to the north of the Shoal—the Southern
portion of which channel is the harbor proper of Key West.—This
channel Should be thoroughly Sounded out, as well as all ramifications
from it which have any depth:—it is not unlikely that water enough
will be found for armed Steamers to enter this channel from the
north; and therefore it is essential that all such passages, if more
than one, be clearly exhibited.—The Soundings in the channels and
bays—indeed in all the deeper water, should be very numerous.—
On the broad Shoals they may be comparatively few—Sufficient,
however, to show the exact margins of these Shoals and their con-
tinuity.—At the northern end of the channel, the Soundings Should
be carried out to four fathoms; and at the Southern expansion, out
to five or five and a half fathoms.—Such shoals, or portions of Shoals,
as may afford points of defence, Should be minutely Sounded, So as
to exhibit a curve for every half fathom below low water.—The
deeper water throughout the whole Survey, Should have a curve
for every fathom.—
This Survey will be about eleven miles long and about five miles
wide.—Should there be any shoals within two or three miles of the
Southern mouth of the channel, they should be included.—The
general level of the island Should be written in many places, and

FL OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 845
the altitude of all the more permanent points.—The Scale of the
general map may be Six inches to one mile.—
It is desirable to have, on a Seperate map, by the Same Scale,
the whole island of Key West with the harbor at the west end, in-
cluding the positions for its defence.—Most of this Map will be
composed of materials which are also on the general map.—The
eastern portion of the island may be Surveyed with less minuteness,
but it will be essential to Shew all the circumstances that would
bear upon a landing thereon, and the occupation of that part by an
Enemy.—There seem to be boat channels at the last end which might
favor the landing of troops and Stores—Could a fleet cover such
a landing and maintain communication with troops on Shore? Could
the progress of troops up the island be effectually resisted with the
aid of natural obstacles?—if solet these obstacles be exhibited &c &c.—
III.—A careful reconnoissance.–Gaulds chart of 1773–4 & 5*
Shows no other well sheltered deep-water harbors on or near the Flor-
ida Shoals, than those above mentioned.—But this is a point on which
there must be no uncertainity.—There are Several reasons why
this chart Should not be too implicitly trusted:—important changes
may have taken place in the seventy years that have elapsed: im-
portant facts may have eluded the notice of the Surveyor, &c,-
But, besides, Shallow-water harbors and channels have their value
greatly increased by the use, now a days, of many war vessels of light
draught.—There should be, therefore, a general reconnaissance of
the whole Florida reef in order to ascertain the actual depth that
may be carried into all the harbors and passages—The Chart of
Gauld will serve as the basis, and no new chart in lieu thereof will
be required unless numerous and important differences are detected.—
Proceeding Westward from Cayo Largo, the reconnoitreing party
should examine, in Succession, all the inlets—running, in each,
one or more Soundings, as may be found necessary, to ascertain the
maximum depth.—Where the depth is sufficient for the Smaller
Steam vessels of War—Say two fathoms, the Soundings should
extend inward, sufficiently to make the extent of this deeper water;
and where there is a sufficient expanse, and the proper cover to
constitute a safe anchorage, a little trigonometry should be applied
to the Shoals and shores, so as to correct any errors, or Supply any
deficiency in the chart.—Where the facts differ materially from
Gauld, a seperate sketch of the harbor or channel should be made.-

west Florida (1780). See J. C. Simpson, A Provisional Gazetteer of Florida Place-
Names of Indian Derivation (Fla. Geol. Survey, Spec. Pub. No. 1, Tallahassee,

846 T E R R IT OR I. A. L. PA P E R S
The remarks just made apply to the Reef, generally. But there
are certain places where still more care and minuteness will be re-
quired.—At the West End of the Cow Keys, there seems to be an
anchorage which should be examined with attention and, of which
it may be advisable to have a sketch.—Bahia Honda is well covered,
has a pretty good depth, and is of easy entrance.—This should be
very carefully explored, and a sketch made of it: the exploration,
moreover, should extend into, and perhaps for the whole length of,
the channel represented as running through the Shoal in a N.W.
direction from this harbor; if ten feet water can be carried through
this channel at low water, the sketch should embrace the whole.—
To the North of Saragold Key there is a pretty good depth; it will
be necessary to ascertain whether there is, in fact, no better access
to that deep water than the chart exhibits.—Should a passage ten
or twelve feet deep be discovered, a sketch should be made of the
harbor. The Boca Grande passage through the Shoal is represented
as affording a draught of nearly, if not quite, three fathoms;—and
unless there has been a material change for the worse since Gaulds
time, this passage demands particular notice.—Of this whole passage
there should, at any rate, be a Seperate Sketch.
The Sketches mentioned might be conveniently made on a Scale
of two inches to one mile.—
Should there be material corrections to make to Gaulds chart,
a new chart should be formed by copying from Gauld all excepting
the corrected portions which should be introduced in the proper
places—using Gaulds Scale.*—
It is probable that the Sketches, the Memoir, and the chart, of
this reconnaissance may suffice for the objects now in view, without
any other Surveys than those before requested.—But should good
water be found into any of the harbors already known, a new harbor
of good depth be discovered, some additional Surveys may be neces-
sary.—It would be well, therefore, to have the results of the recon-
naissance reported at as early a day as practicable.—It must be
needless to say that the existence or non existence of other good
harbors in the reef bears directly upon the question of the proper
selection of defensive points.”—
I have the honor &c

“Resolved—that the President of the United States be requested
to inform the Gaited House under what arrangements the Indians
at present at Florida remain there—whether any, and what steps
are in progress for their removal under the treaty of Payne's Landing,”
—whether any trading houses have been established or are con-
templated to be established for their use—whether any compen-
sation is paid to any one as Indian Agent or Commissioner in
Florida—Whether any annuity or presents have been allowed to
any of the Indians now in Florida—and what part of the public
domain in Florida has been surrenderd to the exclusive occupation
of said Indians, the area and boundaries thereof; and whether said
occupation is unconditional or for a definite period, and upon stipu-
lated terms”
Upon this Resolution I have the honor to report, that the re-
quirement of the first clause of the same is not answerable by reference
to the files of the Indian Office, at which no communication showing
the terms on which the Seminole pacification was ultimately arranged,
has ever been received. But, and this leads me to the 2" and 4"
clauses of the Resolution, which from their near relation in matter
will be most properly answered together—it is not believed that
any arrangement exists which should interfere with the measures
that the Dep" has been and still is pursuing to accomplish, at the
earliest day practicable, the removal of the entire Indian population
of Florida to the new homes assigned them in the west.
The number so far removed is 3824, of which 212 went off during
the last year. How many still remain is not certainly known but
they are not thought to be numerous. The business of Emigration
is under the immediate charge of L.G. Capers who was appointed
disbursing and emigrating agent of the Seminoles east on the 6"
February, ’41, at a compensation of $5 per day, with allowance for
“necessary travelling expenses.” His last report in relation more
particularly to the emigration represents its progress as slow—the
Indians coming in for enrolment only in very small and occasional
parties—but he expresses that by the close of the year a sufficiently
large party would be prepared to start, and this period having passed,
the next intelligence may perhaps enable me to state that the emigra-
tion is very nearly or fully closed."
The 3" clause of the Resolution inquires whether any trading houses
have been established &c. No such houses are known to exist; no in-
structions for their establishment have emanated from this office; and
none are at this time contemplated

No “annuity” has ever “been allowed to any of the Indians now in
Florida,” and this is the only inquiry of what remains of the Resolu-
tion to which the information of this office enables me to frame an
answer. If any presents have been allowed, the evidence is it will
probably be found in the Office of the 2"Auditor, amongst the accounts
of those to whom the disposal of the public funds was confided As to
the extent and geographical description of the “public demain in
Florida surrendered to the Hadiahs exclusive occupation of the Indians”
(if any) and the stipulated terms and conditions of said occupancy,
I do not know where the information is to be sought, unless in the office
of the Adjutant General, to which it is presumed the reports of the
Officer commanding in Florida, were addressed.

THOMAS H. CRAWFORD TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Report Book 4]
WAR DEPARTMENT Office Indian Affairs February 2” 1844
HON J. M. PORTER Secretary of War
SIR, My reflections have for Some time tended to the impression,
that a longer continuance of our agency of enrolment and emigration
amonst the Seminoles east was becoming unnecessary or certainly
that the expense of maintaining it was quite incommensurate with
any advantage to the public Service to be thence derived; and my
recent consideration of the subject while engaged in preparing an
answer to a call of the Senate relative to Seminole affairs, has strength-
ened this impression into conviction
Since February last no party of emigrants has left Florida, and the
latest official accounts from our agent, and the latest official accounts
from our in relation particularly to emigration, represent the Indians
as coming in for enrolment only in very small and occasional parties.
Since then, Sometime in July, we have received no report—and it
may be presumed that the agent has been disappointed in his ex-
pectation as communicated to this office, that by the close of the year,
he would have mustered a party sufficiently large for removal. Under
such indications of indifference to immediate emigration on the of the
Seminoles, with whom it is not contemplated to exercise coercion;
and considering that the number of those still lingering in Florida,
though unascertained, cannot be large, it does not seem that here-
after the preparations for their removal can be so active as to justify
the retention of a distinct agent, or to demand any Service that can-
not, without onerous imposition, be transferred to the military
I would therefore respectfully recommend, that the further efforts
to emigrate the Indians now in Florida, be committed to the military

upon Major Brown's failure to do so, that he was not immediately

may be serious, and is strange. It is the expectation of the General
that the most energetic measures will speedily be taken by you, to
secure this band of marauders, supposed to be refugee Creeks, and
to send them off to the West; and he desired that such instructions

their goods and chattels from their former homes, the navigation of
the coast of Florida generally being considered dangerous. And

SECRETARY'S OFFICE February 7" 1844
HON: GEO. WALKER President of the Senate
SIR, In answer to the Resolution adopted by the Senate on the
24" ultimo,” I have to state that the books and pamphlets belong-
ing to the Territory have been collected, wherever found, and ar-
ranged in appropriate places in my office. I had no opportunity
during the past Summer, of having any of them bound, as the only book
bindery in town, belonging to P. A Hayward Esq, was destroyed in
the fire of May last—It has been recently replaced however, and if I
can make any arrangement Satisfactory to M* Hayward, for the pay-
ment of the work, I will have such pamphlets and public documents
bound, during the approaching Summer, as may be deemed worthy
of the expense.
I have not, as yet, had leisure sufficient, to make out a list of the
public books, documents &c, in my office, but will endeavour to fur-
nish the Senate with this information in as short a time as possible.
The Act of the Legislative Council, relating to the distribution of
the laws of this Territory, approved 13th Feb'y 1831,” and to which
I beg leave to refer the Senate, has made provision to meet, in a corre-
sponding spirit, the courtesy extended to this Territory by the differ-
ent States of the Union, in forwarding copies of their laws &c. It is
to be presumed that the Executive of the Territory, under whose au-
thority our laws are distributed, has caused the directions of the above
mentioned Act to be followed, and that no farther actions, in relation
to this subject, is required on the part of the Legislature.
It is frequently important that the members of the Legislative
Council, should have access to the Revised Codes of the different
States, as matter of reference. With but few exceptions, the State
laws in my office, are contained in pamphlets, the numbers of which
are incomplete. I would, therefore, respectfully suggest for the con-
sideration of the Senate, the propriety of authorizing the Sec'y of the
Territory to transmit to the Secretary of State of each State of the
Union, a copy of DuVal's compilation, with the request that the
Territory may be furnished, in return, with a copy of the Revised
Statutes of each State."
I am, very respectfully Your Obt Serv"

site of Fort Barrancas, Pensacola harbor, from the Navy to the
War Department.—
A plat of the land in the neighborhood of the Navy yard, em-
bracing the site of Fort Barrancas and its dependencies, which had
been reserved in 1838 for public purposes, accompanied by com-
munication.—Upon the plat, the ground required to be thus transferred
was distinctly marked, and the proposed boundaries between the
Naval and Military tracts was also designated.—
Should Congress during its present Session make the appropriations
that have been asked for Fort Barrancas, it will be advisable to com-
mence the construction of the outwork designed in addition, chiefly for
the defence or the Navy yard, the approaching Season, and it would
be desirable to have previously the controul of the necessary ground.-

in relation thereto, as conveyed in the letter of the Commissioner
of the General Land Office of the 24" Sept 1842.” the permits
located under the provisions of that act were surveyed as they have
been located by the settlers, many of them without any regard to
the section lines, intersecting and interrupting these lines, which
as appears from a review of the whole matter, is not in accordance
with the wishes of the Department; you are therefore requested
to go over district *D (Surveyed by Mr L.M. Prevost) and district
*E, (surveyed by M Tho" H Weightman) and continue all the lines
which have been omitted of Public Surveys through any of these
permits, these being the only districts in which such intersections
exist.—
You are herewith furnished with copies of the following plats,
which will more distinctly point out the lines that are to be con-
tinued. Townships 14. 15 & 16 of Range 21. Townships 14. 15. 16
of Range 22. Townships 15. and 20 of Range 23 all of district D,
by L. M. Prevost; and Townships 21 of Range 18 and Township 14 &
15 Range 20 South & East by Tho" H. Weightman. The following
Instructions from the Commissioner of the General Land Office will
govern you in surveying these lines “The intention of this office
has been invariably to restrict the settler to a technical quarter
section, such being the language of the law, to the 2* Section of
which I would particularly call your attention. That Section
provides, that in case of the settlement of the same quarter Section
by two or more settlers, the right to the location shall be determined
by priority of settlement, and the subsequent settler or settlers
shall be permitted to locate the quantity he, she, or they may be
entitled to, else where within the same township, upon vacant public
lands. Where the surveys are made prior to the settlement, the
settler as you perceive is required to designate the quarter section
for which he wished a permit. Where the lands were not surveyed
the settler was to designate his settlement in the clearest manner
possible, by reference to some well known place, lake, river &c, and
when the Surveys reached that settlement, his improvements field,
house, barn &c were to be indicated in the field notes, and shewn on
the official plat of survey by a dotted line, or serrated line, in the
same manner as the ordinary improvements of pre-emptions are
designated; shewing the extent of the field, location of the house,
barn &c. And the quarter section upon which such improvement

may be located, is the tract to which the settler is entitled; and to
which he must be restricted. In cases where the improvements of
the settler are in different quarter Sections, he can elect which of those
quarter Sections he will take; but if he fail to make such selection,
the deputy who makes the survey should designate that as his permit,
on which his main improvements are located, and the quarter Section
thus indicated as his location, should be shaded (not full coloured)
pink, and have the name of the settler, and number of his permit
written on it;—the locality and extent of his field, and, the position,
of his house, barn &c to be exhibited as before directed. The whole
proceedings so far as the Surveys are concerned, and the indications
on the Township Maps, will serve as evidence taken in the ground
of the locations, which will aid in finally determining the quarter
section for which the patent may issue to the settler, and in no case
should such location interrupt the lines of public surveys. Where
two or more persons are settled upon the same quarter section, that
fact should be noted by the deputy.” You must require of the
settler in writing—the designation of the quarter section he selects
as his permit. In addition to the foregoing you are herewith furnished
with a copy of the Act of 4" of August 1842,” together with a copy
of the General Instructions of this office. This work will require
the exercise of all your energies to execute with accuracy. You will
therefore make yourself perfectly familiar with your General &
Special Instructions together with the provisions of the Act above
alluded to which you are required strictly to conform.
As an attempt had been made to bring into disrepute the recent
Surveys, You are requested to examine closely (and make report
to this office) of as many of the lines in this district as will enable
you satisfactorily to conclude whether the Surveys made by M"
Prevost and Mr Weightman in these districts were actual and accurate
Surveys executed in conformity with their oaths & Instructions or
whether they are “Sham surveys” for which false notes have been
returned. This duty is required of you not from any doubts resting
on my own mind, but to disabuse the mind of the Commissioner of
the General Land Office on this subject to whom insinuations of
this kind have been made.

SIR I herewith enclose to you a report of Suits instituted by me
on behalf of the United States since the date of my last report;"
Late in September, or early in October last a letter was written by
Gov" Duval & myself to M Campbell our Consul at Havanna," on
the subject of a Commission, which had been taken out by the Claim-
ants & Sent to that City to take testimony in the cases of the Heirs
of F. M. Arredondo for 50.000 acres of land; the Heirs of F. M. Arre-
dondo & M E Levy for 256000 acres; & the Heirs of J M Arredondo
for 40.000 acres;—giving to M" Campbell, who had been named as
one of the Commissioners, some information & instructions on the
Subject. This letter was prepared while I was still convalescent, but
very feeble from the effects of the attack of Congestive fever, (which
I before mentioned to you) and was mailed by the Gov' & directed
via Charleston S.C. but we have received no reply from him; The
Gov" who is now absent, informed me that he had enclosed to you a
Copy of this letter suggesting the propriety of your forwarding to
M" Campbell a copy of it from your office, to guard against a possible
failure of the original to reach him; As the term of the Court is

GEN: LAND OFFICE February 22, 1844
V. Y. CONWAY S. G. Tallahassee Flor:
SIR. Application has been made to this Office for an order for the
Survey of 6000 Acres, of the claim of Stephen D. Fernandez, confirmed
by the decision of the Supreme Court of the U States at the January
Term 1836,-Peter's Reports Vol: 10. P303. In the Report of the
Commissioners for ascertaining land claims in East Florida,—State
papers, Public lands, Vol 3, p. 687, this tract is described as situated
“about Cooley's hammock on the North East of Ray's trail.” I de-
clined ordering the Survey of this claim at this time, for the reason
that the Surveying funds would be exhausted by the orders already
issued, but as it was represented to be of the utmost importance to
the present owners of this claim that it should be immediately Sur-
veyed, and that those owners were willing to incur the expense and
only desired the Survey to pass through the usual Channels that it
might be regarded as official, I have consented to order it upon the
Condition that the expense should be paid by the owners of the claim.
You will therefore appoint a Deputy in whose skill and integrity you
have the utmost confidence, and have the claim located in accordance
with the instructions heretofore transmitted giving notice to the par-
ties and advising the Deputy that he must look to those owners for
his compensation upon the approval of his work, requiring from him
the affidavit heretofore prescribed, of the correctness of his field notes.
If there is a Deputy residing in the neighborhood of this land, to whom
you could entrust the location of the claim, it would be expedient to
employ him, in order that the parties may not be put to any needless
expense.”

SIR. Enclosed I send you a copy of a letter from John Pickell Esq

Pickell describes the location of two Saline Rivulets, to the existence
of which it would be expedient to call the attention of the Deputy,

To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress Assembled—
The Memorial of the Undersigned the Register and Receiver of the
District of Lands subject to sale at Newnansville Florida, respectfully
Showeth
That the Act of Congress Approved on the 4* day of August 1842,
Entitled “An Act to provide for the Armed Occupation and Settlement
of the unsettled part of the peninsula of East Florida” ” does not
provide any compensation to the Land Officers for the arduous Extra
labour imposed upon them by the Department at Washington in
carrying it into effect. That under Said act Nine hundred and forty
Eight Permits were issued by the Register at this Office between the
12" December 1842 and the 4" of August 1843. That of these issues,
Monthly Returns were required by the Department and three Copies
were required to be made of each application under the certificate of
the Register and Receiver, making in all twenty Eight hundred and
forty four Copies of Applications, besides the correspondence nec-
essarily attendant on the performance of the duties. The Under-
signed would state that on the Sale of a quarter Section of Land, the
law allows them two dollars each and that the labor attending the
issue of one permit was more arduous than that required in case of the
sale of the Quarter Section
The undersigned would also represent that they have been appointed
the Tribunal before which the Settlers are to make proof of their com-
pliance with the law—that this is entirely extra duty and not imposed
upon them by the Law, that the President of the United States could
have appointed any other persons to said duty, and that they can see

no good reasons why the same Compensation should not be allowed to
them that would have been allowed to any other persons.
That their duties as the Tribunal are to notify the Settlers of the
periods for making proof to take the evidence of at least three persons
in each case and to make monthly and yearly returns to the depart-
ment of those complying with the law, and at the expiration of each
period of those who have not Complied.

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 28 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred March 11, 1844]
To the Honorable The Senate & House of Representatives of the United
States.
The undersigned Citizens of East-Florida, respectfully represent
to your Honorable bodies, that they are settlers on the public lands,
under “the Armed occupation law,” passed in August 1842 to facilitate
the termination of Indian hostilities; that they have taken possession
of the land in conformity to the law & the regulations of the General
Land office; that, immigrating to a section of the country before
occupied & known only by Indians, their knowledge of the places
settled was necessarily limited; that, during the warm & dry season,
after repeated attempts, it has been found impossible, in many places,
to procure wholesome water, —the only water obtained being strongly
impregnated with rotton limestone, the use of which, during the last
summer, has occasioned a general sickness.
Your Petitioners would further respectfully represent, that to
require a continued residence on the land selected by them, will
expose them to constant sickness or death, or will force them wholly
to abandon their Settlements & improvements, already made at great
expence & much Sacrifice of health & comfort; many too, having sought
a new home in the wilderness, have invested their all in these improve-
ments; to give up which would consign them to certain poverty & their
families to distress. The continuance of the condition of residence
on the 160 acres, for which “the permit” is issued, will compel many
to remain, from necessity, to Secure the land to themselves & families,


## p. 875 (#891) ############################################

FL OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 875
till their own death vests the land in their heirs. In such cases, the
United States lose the land, while Florida & the country will lose
valuable & useful Citizens, as the most industrious & enterprising will
be the most reluctant & the last to abandon their improvements &
places.
Under these circumstances, your Petitioners respectfully request
your Honorable bodies so to modify “the armed occupation law,”
that the continued residence of the Settler on the land may be dis-
pensed with, & they permitted to hold the 160 acres by occupation &
cultivation; at least, that this modification extend to those, who, after
repeated trials, have failed to obtain wholesome water, & whose
health & life the experience of the past summer proves would be
endangered by a continued residence.
Your Petitioners would further respectfully represent, that the
circumstances, under which the Armed occupation law was passed, &
under which they took possession of the land, have so much changed,
that the object, to be gained by requiring a continued residence on
the land, no longer exists. Then the settlement & residence of citizens
on the land were deemed important to aid in wresting the Country
from the Indians. Now the whole prospect is changed. The enemy
is gone. The soldier rests at ease in his camp. And the health &
life of the citizen are no longer required for the sacrifice. Humanity
requires they should be no longer exposed to danger.
Your Petitioners also respectfully represent, that, by the proposed
change in the law, they believe the Settlement of the country will be
promoted, & its productions increased. Allowed to reside in healthy
locations, & where wholesome water can be procured, the reputation
of the country for health will be sustained, & life will be saved. Other
Settlements will thicken around them, &, by creating a demand for
public land, the interests of the United States will be advanced, & the
population, & productions, & prosperity of the Territory greatly
increased.
Your Petitioners trust, that these considerations, & others, which
will readily suggest themselves, will induce your Honorable bodies
to regard favorably their petition, & to modify “the armed occupation
law,” in accordance with their prayer, & what the interests of the
country & the dictates of humanity seem to them to require.

SECRETARY DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY
[FSL:Fla., Gov. Exec. Corr.:M 31]
Secretary's Office Tallahassee March 20th 1844.
Sir, The Legislative Council of this Territory adjourned on the
15" inst, after a session of 75 days. I herewith enclose to you a
certified copy of the compensation Bill, passed by the Legislature,
and a list of the members and officers of each House, with receipts
for the certificates given for their pay and mileage. You will perceive
that the Executive vetoed the compensation Bill—This he did,
solely because it provided for the payment of objects beyond, and
not contemplated in the Estimates submitted by him, and the appro-
priation made by Congress. After paying the members and officers
of the two Houses, and rejecting certain accounts allowed in the
Compensation Bill, amounting to $3.872.17 and which would not
appear to be properly payable out of the appropriation made by
Congress, it would still be necessary to bring the former within the
latter, to make a further deduction of $1.115.49.
The morning after the adjournment, I was called upon to give
certificates for some of the items allowed in the Compensation Bill,
by the persons who had rendered the Services, and who not residing
here, were anxious to return to their homes. These were M* Long,
for extra services as Clerk—M" Craft for the Same, and Mr Alexander
for newspapers furnished the House. Although I knew that the
two first mentioned accounts were certainly not among the objects
contemplated in the Appropriation, and perhaps, also, the third,
yet knowing that the services were rendered by the authority of the
Legislature, and that I was not invested by Act of Congress with
any express power to reject accounts, I consented to give them
certificates, which simply stated, in substance, that by the Com-
pensation Bill passed by the Legislative Council of Florida,” so
much was allowed to a certain individual, for certain services. No
Statement was made (as in the case with the certificates given to
members and officers of the Council, whose pay is prescribed by

Act of Congress) that the amount specified was payable out of the
Appropriation made by Congress, to defray the expenses of the
Legislative Council. I am particular in making this Statement,
because I believed at the time they were issued, that the character
of the certificates would prevent their negotiation, and that con-
sequently there would be no danger of third persons suffering by
the rejection of the Accounts at your Department.
I therefore gave them certificates, of the character mentioned—
Also, two others, one to W" Rowlett for $59, and the other to Thomas
Hodgson for $36, both being for fuel furnished the Council—But,
as to these, I presume there will be no difficulty. Directly afterwards,
however, upon referring to your letter of the 21" Dec last,” in
regard to certificates issued under the Seal of the Territory, and
having reflected upon the subject maturely, I was satisfied that I
had acted erroneously in giving the two, first mentioned, although
written in a manner, which I thought at the time, would prevent
any negotiation or assignment to third persons, with a beleif, on
their part, that the Government was bound to pay them. But it
seems to be immaterial what may be the language or character of
the certificate—Many are not able to distinguish between them,
and others, although conscious of the uncertainty attending there
payment, will buy them as matter of speculation. For these reasons,
and because the Compensation Bill exceeds so much in amount
the appropriation made by Congress for the same object, I have
determined not to issue another certificate, based upon the former,
but have referred all the parties interested to your Department,
where the law requires that their accounts shall be settled and adjusted.
This determination has given dissatisfaction to some, who think
that because I gave a certificate to one man, under the Compensation
Bill, I ought to give to all others the same. But if I acted hastily
or improperly in one case, I have no idea that it is incumbent on
me to do so in all—But apart from this consideration, I have no
reason to believe, that any one's claim will be prejudiced by the
want of a certificate, as the account upon which each is based, are
all that the accounting officers of your Department require, in order
that they may adjust and settle the same fairly and equitably. To
aid them in so doing, I shall send by this mail a Statement to M*
Wise,” the 1* Auditor, to whom, if you deem it proper, this letter
can be referred. It seems right that I should inform you, that the
first mentioned certificate, given to M* Long, was transferred by
him to the “Bank of Florida” with a knowledge on the part of the

latter, of the uncertainty of its payment. The same institution
advanced some money to M' Gibbons, the additional member,
from Hernando County, on a certificate of what would become due
him, whenever Congress made the appropriation for his pay and
mileage—I send you his receipt, as also, those of the other persons
to whom I issued certificates. Hoping that the course which I
have pursued, may meet with the approbation of the Department.”

SIR: It is represented to the Department that much inconvenience
is experienced by persons engaged in shipping live oak timber for
want of an officer of the customs at New Smyrna in the District of
St. Augustine to perform the acts required by the act “for the gradual
improvement of the Navy” approved 2d of March 1833,” and that
this inconvenience is particularly felt by the contractor at present
engaged in supplying Timber for the Navy. With the view of obviat-
ing these difficulties as well as for the purpose of affording protection
to the interests of the Revenue in the vicinity of New Smyrna, it is
deemed expedient to appoint an Inspector and Deputy Collector
of the Customs to reside at said place, at a moderate compensation,
say Two Dollars per day. The name of Mr. W. Williams, a resident
of New Smyrna, has been suggested to the Department for the situa-
tion, and you are at liberty to submit his appointment or any other
you may deem more suitable for the approval of the Department, and
specify the compensation proposed to be allowed.”

Florida, approved 3" March, 1843," to locate and reserve from sale,
for the use of a Seminary of learning in Florida.—
The first section of the act of 29" January, 1827* providing for the
location of the two Townships for a Seminary of learning directs that
one of them shall be located East of the Apalachicola River and the
other West of that River. As a portion of the Township East of the
River, there has been selected with the approval of the Department
a quantity of land equal to 11% sections, and as a portion of the Town-
ship West of the River, there has been selected in like manner, a
quantity equal to 31% sections; thus leaving a quantity equal to 24%
sections to be selected by you on the East side of the Appalachicola
River, and a quantity equal to 4% sections also to be selected by you
on the West side of that River.
In accordance with the provisions of the act last mentioned, the
selections are to be made in tracts of not less than an entire section
corresponding with any of the legal divisions into which the public
lands are authorized to be surveyed. In locating such tracts in
bodies of land, other than those of technical sections, two half sections,
or four quarter sections, laterally contiguous and forming a square
tract, similar to a technical “section” of a mile square, may be taken.
When it may be deemed expedient to select a fractional section, such
fractional section must be taken in lieu of an entire section. As
some of the lands selected by your predecessor were found to conflict
with the valid claims of Preemptors, it became requisite to strike
from the selections to the extent of those conflicts, and hence it is
that residuary tracts, less than an entire section, have necessarily
been approved; and, also, as a further consequence of those conflicts,
one tract of a half section, and another one of a quarter section yet
remain to be selected. Two quarter sections laterally contiguous,
must be taken for the half-section. Should it be desirable to select
one or more fractional quarter sections, as a portion of this half section
and quarter section, such fractional quarter quarter section must be
taken in lieu of an entire quarter.
I enclose herewith for your information and government, a list,
prepared in the General Land-Office, of the several tracts which have
heretofore been selected with the approval of the Department for the
Institution in question. You are requested, when the selections are
completed, to forward a list of the same to this Department for its
definitive action.
I have to apprise you, in conclusion, that no provision having
been made by Congress for compensation for the service above

specified, none can, of course, be allowed by this Department. In
making the selections, it is, of course, to be understood, that you are
not to interfere with the rights of preemptors, or those who have made
improvements with a view of becoming purchasers of the land.

On the 4” of January last the Department instructed the Collector"
that in consequence of the statement made in his letter of the 21"

his discontinuance of Mr. Price's services as Inspector was approved.

SIR. Your communication of the 1" Ult.” enclosing copies of
letters from Sam' Reid, Deputy Surveyor, and from J. A. Braden &
H. W. Braden relative to the character of M* Reid's surveys, have
been received. I have also received your communication of the 16th
February last,” enclosing Copies of M* Reid's letter, and the affidavit
of Judge Gates & Col: H. W. Braden, and also letters from Mess”
Camp, Randolph, Brown, Duvall, Hackley & Butler, in relation to
the character of R. B. Kerr, the author of the letter a copy of which
was communicated to you on the 20" January last." The course
pursued by you in this delicate and unpleasant business has been per-
fectly proper. The Deputy who has been appointed to continue the
Sectional lines heretofore interrupted by the Survey of the permits
under the Armed occupation law, will be able to give competent and
disinterested testimony as to the character of the Surveys made by
Mess" Weightman & Provost, which, with the mass of testimony
submitted by you, affecting M. Kerr's credibility, will I hope, remove
every shadow of doubt as to the character of those Surveys.
As you state that you have strictly & closely examined the field
notes returned by M. Reid, and are satisfied, so far as that examina-
tion goes, that his work appears to have been faithfully done, and as
you also certify to the high standing of Judge Gates and the Mess”
Bradens, who have given testimony, from personal examination, of
the correct and satisfactory manner in which M. Reid's work has been
executed the amount of his account which has been withheld, should
now be paid him. The course pursued by M. Reid in obtaining the
testimony of disinterested and credible witnesses to refute the charges
brought against his work is correct & proper, and the measures con-
templated by him to put at rest every rumor on the subject is highly
praiseworthy and should be carried out, —for you are aware, that

Boundary line between the State of Georgia and Florida.” A brief
sketch of the past action upon the subject of this boundary by the
General Government and the State of Georgia may serve at once to
explain its present embarrassment and to indicate the proper relief.
For detailed information on the subject you are respectfully referred
to Document N° 43, House of Rep's, 1* Session 22" Congress."
Soon after the opening of the Surveyor General's Office at Talla-
hassee, in 1824, Surveyor General Butler was instructed by Mr.
Graham, Commissioner of the General Land Office,” to cause the
line to be surveyed from the junction of the Flint and Chattahoochie
Rivers to the mound established at the head of the St Mary's by
Messrs. Ellicott & Minor, Commissioners of the United States and
Spain under the Treaty of 1795. This duty was, accordingly per-
formed by D. F. McNeil, Deputy Surveyor, early in the year 1825. It
appears, from Surveyor General Butler's correspondence, that a line
had previously been run by authority of the State of Georgia, which
was generally South of McNeil's line and in some places as far as
# of a mile distant from it.” No other line was attempted to be run
until, in March 1827, Thomas M. Randolph, Commissioner on the
part of the United States and Thomas Spalding, Commissioner on
the part of Georgia, commenced, under the provisions of the Act of
Congress of 4" May 1826,” jointly to run and mark the line from the
head of S*Mary's, as designated by Ellicott and Minor, to the junction
of the Flint and Chattahoochie rivers. The operations of this
joint Commission were arrested before their conclusion by the heavy
rains, and even if concluded would have been useless, inasmuch as
the State of Georgia had, while the parties were in the field, recalled
her supposed assent to the conclusions of the Commission and de-
clared that the “Head of St Mary's" was a point to be determined
by further investigation; whereas the Act of Congress, of May 4"
1826, had assumed that by Messrs. Ellicott and Minor it had been
finally and conclusively established. From this time until 1834, the
General Government and the State of Georgia seem to have been at
issue upon this point. The State, by resolutions and reports of her
Legislature and communications from her Governor, repeatedly as-
serted and argued her claim to commence the boundary at the head
of the South Branch of St Mary's, while the Judiciary Committee
of the Ho: of Reps. U.S. have as often replied to the arguments of
the State and re-asserted the position taken in the Act of 4" May 1826.

Two Bills have been reported to the Ho: of Reps. from the Judici-
ary Committee: the first (N° 221) during 1" Session 22* Congress,”
and the second (No 270) during 1" Session 23* Congress.” These
Bills were identical. They were supplementary to the Act of 4* May
1826, and authorized the President to cause the line to be run in con-
formity with the directions of that Act, but with or without the co-
operation of Georgia. Neither of these Bills was finally acted on in
Congress, and since the Session of 1833, ’34—the subject does not
appear upon the Journals.
The line run by authority of the State of Georgia, prior to 1825,
does not coincide with that run by McNeil, under instructions from
this Office in 1825. McNeil's line terminates on the S. Mary's at
Ellicott and Minor's mound, and the unfinished line of Commis-
sioners Randolph and Spalding was commenced in conformity with
the Act of Congress, one mile north of that mound. No accurate
line then has ever been run, and it is not known that any legal recog-
nition attaches to any line.
The matter rests in the hands of Congress by whom this Office is
yet to be directed as to the method and the extent of its action con-
cerning it.
It may not be amiss to suggest that, whenever the line shall be
ordered to be surveyed, an accurate performance of the duty will re-
quire a higher degree of skill, a superior class of instruments and a
better rate of compensation than usually fall to the lot of deputy
Surveyors.”

on the 17" of September 1822.”—the second on the 29" of December
1824;” but that now in force is the 20* Section of the act of November
19* 1828, entitled “An act for the apprehension of criminals and the
punishment of crimes and misdemeanors.” The Legislative Coun-
cil of Florida, on the 4" of March 1841, passed a Resolution N° 22,"
the second section of which provides that “from and after the adop-
tion of this resolution, the Marshals and District Attorneys of the
respective Judicial Districts be instructed in making out their ac-
counts against the United States for the expenses attendant upon the
administration of the laws, to embrace in the same such as may occur
in consequence of the apprehension, safe keeping and prosecution of
criminals and the several Judges are respectfully requested to certify
the same.”
Thus while the costs in the first instance are paid by the United
States in all criminal prosecutions in which the Territory is Plaintiff,
the fines, if any are imposed, are paid into the Treasury of the Ter-
ritory, under this Resolution of the Legislative Council.
Fines and penalties, generally, have been paid into the Treasury of
the United States, and constitute a portion of the fund for the pay-
ment of Judicial Expenses.—It appears to be proper that the fines
collected in Florida, should take the same destination, particularly as
in many instances, it would be but a repayment of money advanced
by the general government.
I have no authority to interfere in the matter, to which my atten-
tion has been recently directed, and I therefore present it to your
notice that it may receive the consideration of Congress, if you are of
opinion that it requires their attention.”

[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:LS]
[May 12, 1844]
TO THE HON' J. C. CALHOUN Secretary of State
SIR The undersigned citizens of East Florida, on behalf of them-
selves and many others interested in the culture of the lemon and
orange, take the liberty to address you for the purpose of soliciting
a favor which your official position gives you the power, as they
feel assured you will have the disposition, to grant.
About six years ago an insect made its appearance among our orange
groves which has resisted all our efforts to subdue it, and has now
obtained such an ascendancy as to threaten the total destruction of
this important culture.
The insect is a species of coccus and looks like small oval dry scals
of a brownish red color attached to the leaves & small limbs. They
are apparently inanimate but notwithstanding, they propagate
rapidly and after they have made their first appearance in a grove
soon prevade every part of it. The trees assume in a short time a
sickly appearance, become in a great measure defoliated and dried,
all the limbs decaying and in some instances the trunk down to the
ground
Numerous remedies have been perseveringly applied but with
only partial success. The progress of the enemy is onward and if
not soon arrested the orange culture in E. Florida must be
abandoned—
We are exceedingly anxious to know the history of the coccus
insect among the orange groves of the Mediterranean, and it is to
beg the favor of you to obtain the desired information from our
consuls in those countries that we have taken the liberty to trouble
you with this communication
The queries we would put to our consul for instance in the Island
of Sicily are to this effect: 1* Is there any tradition or record to
shew that the insect above described ever appeared among the orange
groves of Sicily? 2*. If so at what period and how long did it
continue? 3”. Is there any such insect now existing on the
Island? If not how long since it disappeared or was exterminated?
4—While it remained did it desolate the orange groves and prevent
their bearing? 5 Did it disappear spontaneously or by the use of
remedies—if by the latter what are they and how applied? 6 Is
there any book on the orange culture which gives a history of this
insect and if so could a copy be obtained?

It is understood, that some efforts may be exerted in Congress, to

GOVERNOR CALL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[NA:SD, Applications: ALS]
TALLAHASSEE 22" May 1844
SIR I beg leave to place before you charges of a grave and serious
character against Charles S Sibley Dist. Atty of the United States
for the Middle District Of Florida."
First I charge the said District Attorney with aiding and promoting
malicious prosecutions to gratify personal and political animosity.
The Specifications for this charge will be found in two indictments
for “Nuisance” prepared and signed by said District Atty against
myself at the May term 1844 of the Superior Court for the County
of Wakulla. The first of these indictments charges in the usual form
that Richard K. Call did on the 1* day of January 1844 “unlawfully
wilfully and maliciously” erect a pier or filler composed of wood and
stone, in the St Marks River, a navigable stream, by which the naviga-
tion of said River is obstructed. An examination of the facts of this
case, facts universally known in this community, and to no one better
than to the said Attorney, will prove to the satisfaction of any un-
prejudiced mind, the wanton malice, or gross ignorance, in which this
prosecution originated."
Here where the facts are known this proceeding excites only the
contempt and ridicule of all honest and intelligent men. But at

Washington where it was intended to operate, and where the facts are
unknown, to have it said that the Governor of Florida has been in-
dicted, leaves the impression that he has been guilty of some violation
of law or good morals, which renders him amenable to criminal justice.
A brief narrative of the facts will shew the injustice of such a con-
clusion. In the year 1834 the Legislative Council of Florida, granted
a charter to the Tallahassee Rail Road Company.” I soon after be-
came one of the principal Stock holders, and the President of that
Company which situation I still hold. The charter authorized in
express terms the company to construct a draw bridge over the St
Marks River at the intersection with the Rail Road This was ac-
cordingly done, and the pier, for the erection of which I am now in-
dicted was built by the direction of the Company, and under the
express authority of law as early as the year 1839. The draw of this
Bridge was sufficient for the accomodation of all vessels navigating
the St Marks River, and from the time of its construction until the
13" of Sept. 1843, a period of near five years, no difficulty or delay
attended any vessel bound up or down the river in passing the bridge.
At the date above mentioned the bridge was swept off by a storm
which desolated that part of our Sea Board, leaving the pier standing
in the River with a clear and unobstructed passage on each side of it,
sufficient to admit with convenience the passage of the largest vessel
which can ever ascend the St Marks River.
The charge then of obstructing the navigation of the St Marks
River by the erection of the pier is false and unfounded, and the charge
of erecting the pier unlawfully, and maliciously is also false and known
to be so, by the District Attorney before and at the time of drawing
the Indictment. I make this unqualified charge against the District
Attorney, because I know he has been frequently on the Bridge, was
well acquainted with its localities, and that he had every opportunity
of reading the charter in our Statute Book, under which the Bridge was
constructed.
The disastrous storm of the 13th of September 1843, by which I
sustained a loss of not less than $50.000. carried the Bridge erected
on the pier, and deposited it, partly on the Bank, and partly in the
River, a short distance above its former position, and this combined
action of the elements, directed by the hand of Providence, con-
stitutes the ground of the second indictment which charges that
Richard K. Call did “unlawfully” and “maliciously” fix place put
and set a certain deck of a bridge in the St Marks River, a navigable
stream, by which the navigation is obstructed, when it was well known

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 907
to the said District Attorney, that the Bridge was removed and placed
where it now is, by the will of God. I therefore charge, and from
facts and circumstances, shall I think be able to prove that the said
District Attorney well knew every materiel statement contained in
both indictments to be false at the time of drawing them, and that
he has prostituted the authority of his office for the most unwarranted,
and malicious purposes.
I further charge the said District Attorney with high misdemeanor,
in compromising various criminal prosecutions in the Courts of this
District for private ends, and I charge him with official impropriety
in receiving pay in the name of fees from defendants in criminal cases,
as an inducement to dismiss proceedings against them, after indict-
ments found, and in cases where the facts and the law made it his im-
peritive duty to prosecute to conviction.”
I will sir in a few days forward evidence to support these charges.
But if a more public investigation of them should be deemed proper.
I respectfully recommend that Ex Gov W* P Duval, James E. Broome
Judge of the County Court of Leon County, residing at Tallahassee
& David L. White, Judge of the County Court of Gadsden County,
Quincy, be appointed commissioners to take testimony, and report
the result to the proper Department of the Government."

GENERAL LAND OFFICE May 27* 1844.
REGISTER & RECEIVER at Newnansville E. Florida.
GENTLEMEN, Representations have been made to this Office by the
Hon: David Levy that cases exist in Florida, in which Settlers are
subjucted to very great expense, inconvenience and hardship, in con-
sequence of their being compelled to appear in person with their
witnesses at Newnansville and S" Augustine, to make proof of Set-
tlement &c.
The 4" proviso of the 1* Section of the Armed Occupation Act of
the 4th August 1842,” is to this effect, “that such settler shall within
one year after the Survey of Said lands, and the opening of the proper
Office for the entry and Sale of the same by the United States, prove,
before such tribunal, and in such manner and form, as shall be pre-
scribed by the Commissioner of the General Land Office with the Ap-
proval of the President, the fact that the settlement has been com-
menced” &”—Pursuant to this requirement of the Act, the Register
and Receiver have been Designated as the “tribunal,” before which
the proof is to be made and in my instructions of the 29* June 1843,"
it is stated that “it would be desirable that in all cases of conflicting
claims, the parties should appear before you with their respective
witnesses, in order to give you an Opportunity of cross examining
the witnesses” &°.
There is nothing in the law and instructions quoted incompatible
with allowing Settlers, to whose Claims there is no Opposition, to
make their own depositions and have their witnesses examined before
a local Magistrate duly authorized.
In all cases then, where the claimants cannot without expense and
hardship, or other serious inability, appear at your Office in person
with their witnesses, you are authorized to dispense with such per-
sonal attendance, but, in such cases the following requirements must
be observed.—
The proof must be taken and the witnesses examined before a
local Magistrate, whose Official character must be certified under
Seal, by a Clerk of the Court, or other Officer using a Seal—

The affidavits of the witnesses must be subscribed by them respec-

and credibility must be certified to by the Magistrate.
Such testimony must be sent to you Officially, under Seal, the par-
ties paying the expense of transmission through the mail or other-
wise; and where Sent by an Attorney, the Power of Attorney giving
Authority to Act must accompany the papers, and at the same time,
the Affidavit of the Claimant must be sent, giving the reason of his
inability to attend.—Of the Sufficiency of this proof, which is to be
filed before you within the time required by law you are to judge as
the “tribunal,” under the Act.
This instruction is not intended to embrace within its purview,
parties whose right is contested, or to whose claim there is any op-
position.
They must appear before you for the reasons stated in my letter of

Among those evils which have been brought to their notice and
which they cannot look upon as less than a leading and threatening
one to the interests of the community in the great looseness or laxity
that too generally prevails in the management of the Slave population.
It is a fact as established by proof which they cannot hesitate to con-
sider more than abundant that from want of care or a mistaken
policy on the part of many slave owners, an inertness in the enforce-
ment of the laws or a lameness in the laws themselves an extent of
privilege and indulgence is permitted to this description of population
to which they can have no consistent claim and which is wholly in-
compatible with a just estimate on their part of their proper position.
In this connexion the Grand Jury Present that if there is no Statute
in existence which prohibits gambling in the Slave an impunity is
secured to him by a strange omission on the part of the Legislature
in the perpetration of a crime that is made severely and justly punish-
able in a white man, a distinction in favor of the negro neither in
wholesome keeping with the rightful spirit of our institution or in
consonance with the plainest principles of common justice—
The Grand Jury also present as a positive injury the almost universal
usage among Slave owners in making the slaves in substance free
dealers by allowing them to go forth and hire themselves by the day
or otherwise to who ever may incline to employ them no matter for
what service This practice which is of necessity followed by a relaxa-
tion of dicipline and in them a forgetfullness of duty, gives them the
possession of money and affords them the means of debauchery and
cannot but lead to the ultimate ruin of the slave, if not to more dis-
astrous consequences to the Community, It is the Grand Jury are
aware contended by not a few that in as much as negroes here are
mostly property there exists as a general rule no right to Legislate for
their government, that this should be left to the undisturbed dis-
cretion of the owner, At the same time that we freely admit the
property condition of the Slave we by no means yeild a full assent to
the correctness of the proposition that the owner is entitled to the ex-
ercise of an entire independance in regard to the management of this
property, because the public weal greatly depends upon the propriety
of manner in which it is governed, and it is therefore the undoubted
privilege of the public to supervise and even dictate in the matter, so
far as the same may be necessary to the general safety
Horses or cattle are assuredly not less property than slaves! and
yet legal enactments have been deemed requisite to govern and
restrain these—if then it be proper to provide by law for the control
of a description of property from which nothing beyond contingent
minor injury is to be apprehended, how much more proper and
necessary is it, to establish security against the great moral detriment

which must inevitably spring from the presence of an inadequately
restrained and weakly governed slave property.
A case has been brought to the knowledge of the Grand Jury of
most culpable mismanagement on the part of a slave owner which
seems emphatically to demand the expression of their unanimous
reprehension—They allude to a case in which a slave was shown to
have perpetrated a violent assault upon the person of the son of
the owner, The son being at the time manager of the plantation
upon which the slave was—which outrage the owner not only pro-
tected the slave in on his own premises—but in the practice of wholly
misapplied lenity successfully devoted his exertions to procure the
entire escape of the culprit from chastisement under the law thus
in effect justifying the slave—such a course pursued by masters
is not only calculated to have a baneful influence upon the interests
of other owners of slave property, but is likely moreover to lead to
consequences even more hurtful to society at large.
The Grand Jury hold that mere abstractions even in law palpably
hostile to the public safety cannot and ought not to be entertained
and however far the suggestions of the Court in the charge as to
the investigation and presentment of crime in the slave population
has from legal quibble, or from any other cause fallen short of bringing
upon offenders the merited inflictions, They may not withhold the
unanimous proffer of their own thanks to his Honor Judge Bronson
and the unqualified opinion that the community at large is most
deeply indebted to him for his course in the matter—which if it
has been prevented the production of any other good has had the
effect to suitably awaken the community to a sense of wide spread
and alarming evils.
The Grand Jury present the existing system of Patrol in the City
of St Augustine, as lamentably defective & as entirely failing to
produce the objects intended by it, They conceive that to ensure an
effective organization of this portion of the City Police, a regularly
enrolled gaurd should be established under the engagement of service
for a specified period and with a provision for such reasonable payment
as will impose the obligations of a faithful discharge of duty, and
they respectfully recommend the Subject to the early consideration of
the City Council—While the Grand Jury would give their full and
hearty commendation of a due energy and vigilance on the part of the
public officer—they do not hesitate to deprecate and condemn in
their proceedings and prosecutions vexatious and unnecessarily
harassing—they therefore present as injuriously affecting the harmony
and interest of the community that from an excess of zeal or some
other inconceivable cause on the part of certain Federal Officers a
vast and unprecedented amount of litigation involving great incon-

venience and expense to the Citizen—much onerous and causeless
labor to the Court and the almost total engrossment of the time of
the District Attorney, and at heavy cost without any adequate
good to the Government, has of late been introduced and practiced
gregiously annoying to the public, which has already seriously checked
and must it is beleived, if persisted in ultimately in a great measure
destroy the commerce of the District
The Grand Jury regret that no action has as yet been taken in
Congress upon the subject of the losses of our inhabitants by the
late Indian War, in relation to which, a petition from the sufferers
in this section of Country" and a memorial from the Governor
and Legislative Council of the Territory, were some months since
forwarded to Washington.” They trust that an early opportunity
will be taken at the rext Session, to bring this matter so vitally
important to a numerous class of our Citizens and so just and righteous
in its demands—in a strong and favorable light to the attention
of that body, and that it may be urged with a zeal and earnestness
to which it is so manifestly entitled in Equity.
In conclusion the Grand Jury respectfully call the attention of
the General Government, to the fact of the greatly increased and
increasing duties of the Judge of this District—It is a matter of
indisputable notoriety that the labors performed by this officer far
exceed those of any other Judge in the Territory while his compen-
sation if it do not fall short of that of other officers of his grade is
far from being justly commensurate with the amount of service
he is called upon to perform and they therefore recommend that a
suitable increase of salary be allowed to him.
The Grand Jury request that this presentment be read in open
Court and published in the Newspapers of the City and copies for-
warded to our Delegate in Congress and to the State Treasury and
Navy Departments

REGISTER AND RECEIVER at S*Augustine E. Florida.
GENTLEMEN Herewith I send an Act of Congress approved the
15" ins", entitled “An Act to amend an Act entitled ‘An Act to provide
for the Armed Occupation and Settlement of the unsettled part of
the peninsula of Florida’.”
To the provisions of this Act which are clear and explicit, I invite
your careful attention.
By the 1* Section, Authority is given to the Commissioner of the
General Land Office to permit a change of any location made under
the Act of the 4"August 1842" on lands discovered after the issue of
the permit to be liable to overflow, “provided Application for Per-
mission to Change,” “shall have been made at the proper land Office
before” the 4th August 1843.
You are requested to report for the decision of this Office, all such
applications, each accompanied by the testimony submitted in support
of it, indicating the tract originally located, and the one applied for
in lieu thereof, -with your joint Opinion in the case.
By the 2* Section, it is provided that in all cases of Settlement
under the Act of 1842 “upon lands not surveyed before the issue of
permit, the settler may after Survey locate his quarter Section in any
legal subdivision of Continuous or Contiguous Sections, or fractional
Sections, so as to make up the quantity” of 160 Acres as (near) “as
may be and to include his improvements, and as much of the lands
described in his permit as is consistent with the System of the public
Surveys.”—
You will take care that this provision of law is properly and faith-
fully carried into effect, having due regard to compactness of form in
Location, so far as is consistent with the law and the rights of the
settlers under it.
By the 3" Section of the Act you will observe that the requirement
of actual residence by the Act of 1842, on the tract located under it,
is only dispensed with in cases where the land upon which the habita-
tion may be erected, shall be entered and paid for, if in market, or if
not in market, shall be so entered within three months after it shall
have been offered at public Sale.
In all cases then where the habitation may be erected on a tract
other than that located under the permit, and the purchase is not made

of the tract embracing said habitation as required by this Act, the
Claimant will forfeit all right under the Act of 1842.
The 4* Section provides “that in any case in which the title of the
United States to the land, or any part of it not less than forty Acres,
described in the permit” or “contained in the quarter Section upon
which he shall have located, shall prove to be defective,” a tract of
equal quantity “to that of which the title shall have proved deficient
as aforesaid, may be located elsewhere upon vacant surveyed lands,
within the same township, or within the nearest township in which
there shall be a sufficient quantity of vacant arable land.”
In all applications for the benefit of this Section of the law, you
will require satisfactory evidence to be filed in your Office, Shewing
the tract claimed, and the nature and extent of interfering titles, and
on the papers (proof &c) You will endorse your decisions, and des-
ignate thereon the tract allowed to be located in lieu of that to which
the title of the United States may be defective.
You will also require the permit to be surrendered in such cases and
will note thereon, your decision in brief, and also the description of the
tract taken in lieu of the land embraced by the United States De-
fective title as aforesaid. You will also report an Abstract of all cases
admitted by you under this Section of the law, shewing the particulars
in each case.
The 5* Section needs no elucidation or comment, only requiring
care and attention on your part, and a proper return to this Office of
any proceedings under it."

SIR: Your two letters of the 13th ult,” and 5th instant” to the
Secretary of War, the first in reference to apprehended difficulties
with the Indians in Florida, and the second, reporting that three or
four men of a surveying party had been killed by Indians near Peas
Creek, have been received, and copies furnished to Brigr. General
Worth to induce inquiries and vigilence.”
I deem it proper to add that the reports received recently from
Lieut. Col. Belknap," Commanding at Tampa Bay, of the friendly
disposition of the Indians in Florida, and of their humanity in one
or more instances to white men in distress, do not agree with the
representations made by your correspondents, and lead to the belief
that they are misinformed as to the true condition of affairs in that
quarter.—
I am Sir, &c.

SIR I have the honor to inform you that I have recently heard
from my entire corps of Surveyors in the Indian River District &
they are all moving on in fine health & spirits. The Indians oc-
casionally afford a little diversion by offering a harmless menace—
Some time since a Deputy found painted on one of his blazed line
trees a rifle & cross—designed I suppose to indicate the penalty
of violating their reserved rights, by crossing their lines.

SIR I herewith enclose to you my reports of Suits decided &
pending in our Superior Court at the last March term thereof. at St.
Augustine, which was adjourned over to the first Monday in June
& ended on the 29* day of that month, I have no suitable blank
forms for reports of Land Cases & have therefore made one seperate
from the other, embracing all the cases on the Land docket at that
time; & also those which have been remanded by the Supreme court
for further action in the Court below; but which have not yet been
docketed; by which you will perceive that a final disposition was
made of six cases embracing upwards of 380,000 acres of land, & that
the cases remanded & not docketed embrace about 200.000 acres;
leaving yet fourteen cases embracing about 260.000 acres, for the
further action of our Court here. This Service is attended with much
labour and responsibility. No specific appropriation was I observe
made at the last session of Congress to defray the expense of defend-
ing land claims in Florida; was one asked? If there was please in-
form me at what period of the Session, & the cause of its failure, and
why I cannot be paid out of the contingent or Judiciary fund without
any such specific appropriation, I was so paid at one period for sev-
ral years, as there has been “a decided increase of duty” in that
branch of service, I take it for granted that the Salary has not been
reduced 7°

SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letters of the 22" May,”
and 2** and 3" of June last,” with accompanying papers,”—com-
plaining of certain malversations in office of Charles S. Sibley, Attorney
of the United States for the Middle District of Florida. With regard
to the first specification, the aiding and promoting malicious prosecu-
tions to gratify personal and political animosity, -I can only state
that this department is not the proper authority to which application
should be made in the first instanc a Court of Justice, in my opinion
is the proper tribunal to examine and pronounce upon this charge, and
to it recourse ought first to be had by the parties aggrieved. The
other two allegations, charging Mr Sibley “with high misdemeanors in
comprising various criminal prosecutions,” &c. and “with official
impropriety in receiving pay, in the name of fees, from defendants
in criminal Cases, as an inducement to dismiss proceedings against
them after indictments found,” &c, are of a character to challenge
inquiry.” A copy of the papers preferring these charges will accord-

SIR: On the subject of your letter of the 18" Ins” I have to
state that the reservation of Keys or Islands ordered pursuant to
advice from the War Dep" embraces, according to the understanding
of this Office all tracks of land on the Gulf side of the Florida Coast,
which may be entirely surrounded by water, and which are so well
Known under the Designation of “Keys” or “Islands”—
I am of opinion that you much over estimate the area that will
be covered by Said Reservation, but I will transmit to the Secretary
of War a Copy of your letter in view of your suggestion to restrict
the reservation to the Islands “Surrounded by navigable waters—
or outside the Actual Coast—or at and opposite harbors,” and in refer-
ence also to the alternative which you suggest in case the reservation
is not restricted.—
In regard to your remarks respecting the Military Reserve at
Tampa Bay, I have to state that it is Contemplated, & protected
by law, and if there is any undue exercise of Military Authority at
that place to the prejudice of any citizen, complaint should be pre-
ferred to the War Department."

We are induced to believe from what the Negroes tell us (of course

on the 27th Ult off Pensacola Bar was the Boat of the said Jonathan
Walker and if so that there is scarcely room for a doubt that the
“Poinset” could have overhauled her in a few hours, and have saved
us the delay, trouble and expense to which we have been subjected
by the application for the services of that Wessel being refused.

SIR, The communication of the Commissioner of the General
Land Office of the 22" inst,” together with its enclosure from the
Receiver of public moneys at Newmansville, Florida,” in reference
to certain reservations ordered to be made in the Territory for the
use of the War Department, have by your directions been examined
at this Bureau.
So little of the Coast of Florida on the Gulf side is known at the
present day, that it would seem to be injudicious to attempt to des-
ignate by name each Key or Island which might hereafter be required
by the War Department for military purposes.

The Florida Keys (proper) have been accurately surveyed and
laid down upon the Chart of Gauld, published in 1790.” These Keys
extend from Cape Florida on the Atlantic, to the Tortugas, in the
Gulf of Mexico, some 250 miles in extent. Among these Keys there
are doubtless some which it would be proper to reserve; for example
Key West, if it be the property of the United State, and for Naval
purposes, probably the Tortugas Keys; other points it would be nec-
essary to reserve for Light-Houses, but as before stated, it would
seem in consequence of the want of sufficient knowledge of localities,
to be injudicious to attempt to designate points for reservation.
Cedar Keys, near the mouth of Suwanee River, and now used as a
depot for troops, was reserved from sale by an order of the President
of the United States, dated 24 March 1840.
In the absence of exact information I would respectfully recom-
mend that the suggestion of the Receiver at Newmansville be adopted,
to wit: that the reservation from Sale for military purposes so far as
Islands and Keys are concerned should be confined to such as may
be “Surrounded by Navigable waters”, or, “at and opposite
Harbours”.”

can be no necessity for the very comprehensive reservations first de-

it is quite important that the portions of ground wanted, or likely to
be wanted, for public purposes, should be designated as soon as
practicable. The reconnaissance & surveys of the Florida Reef
which I asked for last winter, will supply accurate information as to
all those islands: and it might be worth while to send an officer or two
next winter, along the coast of E. Florida, to make a reconnaissance
for the purpose of selecting all the probable sites of Military works or
establishments. In the meantime the reservations might be made
under the limitations expressed by Mr Parsons. I can detail one or

TALLAHASSEE August 6th 1844
SIR Your letter of the 13th ultimo, with its enclosure, was for-
warded to me on its receipt by M. Papy,” by express, to St Andrews
Bay, West Florida, where I had gone to spend a few weeks with my
family. I returned as soon as I could with convenience, but the
fatigue of a journey of upwards of 120 miles, through a sandy pine
barron, in an open sulky, the thermometer upwards of 90° has oc-
casioned me such illness, that since my arrival, I am scarcely able to
attend to business.
I have seen the evidence &c forwarded to you by my brother, Col
Sibley " this day, and also his letter accompanying it." Had I been
here in time, it should have displayed less resentment against the
authors of these charges, and its tone and temper would have been
more mild. However my friends may be excited on this subject,
I assure you, the making of these charges has not in me, caused any
feelings of bitterness. I feel confident groundless as they are, they
cannot injuriously affect my character, and, I only regret that I have
an enemy, (which I did not before believe,) who would have done me
so great injustice. I do not desire to know who have made these
charges, which it may be necessary, by the indentification of the cases
referred to, to direct my attention to evidence, to disprove them.
Indeed I prefer their names should remain unknown, for in ignorance
or uncertainty, I shall still extend to them those civilities, which under
other circumstances I should feel obliged, from self respect, to withold.
Besides, it might occasion unpleasant difficulties between them and
some of my friends. By the next mail, if my health permits, I will
address you fully with regard to these accusations, and give the ex-
planations you ask for in your communication. In the mean time,
I enclose to you, a copy of a letter, containing sundry queries to Leslie
A Thompson Esq," Counsellor at Law, who acted for a long time as
the deputy of different former District Attorneys of this District,
and who was also Auditor of Public Accounts of the Territory of

SIR Wm. P. Duval Esq of Florida has presented to this Office an
account for professional Services rendered as Land Agent. and Counsel
of the United States in defending their interests in Certain land Cases
pending in the Territory of Florida—All of which are particularly
enumerated in the account itself. and in an official Statement of the
Clerk of the Court. which accompanies it. To place this fully before
you I also inclose a Copy of a letter from the Solicitor to Governor
Duval. dated 25th March 1843. under which these Services were
rendered. From this you will perceive that the Services of Gov. Duval
were deemed of great importance to the U. States, and that he the
Solicitor entertained a Strong Confidence that Congress would make
a Special appropriation to Compensate him—No such appropriation
was made however, and this account is now presented for the Specific
Services rendered under the beleif that it may properly be paid either
out of the appropriation for unproved Claims or the appropriation
for the payment of the expenses of Suits & prosecutions.—
In regard to the Sums charged it will be seen from the Certificates
of the District Judges & Attorney and the Hon D. Levy. delagate
in Congress from the Territory & members of the bar that they are
deemed reasonable and proper, and Such as would be charged by any
good Counsel in that Territory for the like Services.—

to a close, the business of the Executive Office, at this season of the
year, has not, usually, been considerable, or of an arduous or difficult
nature. Unless something extraordinary, therefore, should occur
(which I have no occasion, at this time, to anticipate) I do not suppose
that there will be any absolute necessity of your being here until
sometime in the fall. In the meantime, should I apprehend that
any thing will occur, requiring your presence, you shall be promptly
advised of it.
I think it proper to say to you, that I have this day written a letter
to the Secretary of War," requesting that he would furnish the neces-
sary arms &c, to a company of artillery, which has been formed and
organized in this City, under an Act of the Legislative Council, passed
at its last session. It is under the command of an able and experi-
enced Officer, and most worthy citizen, Cap’t John B de Corcé, and
if the arms and other equipments necessary, can be obtained from
the Government, I have no doubt but that it will be made a most
efficient corps, through the zeal and ability of Cap’t de Corcé, and
capable of rendering signal service to the Country, whenever called
upon to Act. If you should feel disposed to aid the Company in its
application, during your visit to Washington, and can succeed in
procuring the arms required, it would give great satisfaction to our
Citizens, generally.
Be pleased to accept my warmest thanks, for the friendly assur-
ances contained in your letter.

your mind all apprehension of danger to your constituents in Florida.
I may further add that my recent conversations with General
Worth give me further assurance of the safety of the people of Florida
from all mischievous intentions on the part of the Indians.
I feel assured you will agree with me that individuals on the fron-

SIR Your several communications of the 7th "8"" & 10" * inst
have been received.
You will have perceived by the letter of instructions addressed to
you on the 2" July,” that the Appropriations for Florida were made
without reference to this Bureau. Consequently that it had no means
of knowing the proper route for the contemplated Rail Road.
In the absence of the necessary information upon which instructions
could properly be prepared, application was made to the Delegate
from Florida (at whose instance the appropriations were made) for
such information as would enable the Bureau to carry out the object
and intention of the law, and it was upon information thus derived
that your instructions were prepared.
It would appear by your communication, and by the representation
of others capable of imparting correct information upon the subject
of the route of the proposed Rail Way, that a better and shorter line
than that designated in your instructions of 2" July, is to be found
between Pilatka and the Gulf.
Under these circumstances you will consider your instructions in
reference to this particular survey suspended until the Chief Topogl.
Engineer now absent from this City, can be apprised of the fact.

SIR, Lieu" Col" Belknap, Commanding at F* Brooke, remarks
in an official report of the 16" ins" on Indian matters”—“I under-
stand that a person by the name of Russel, from North Carolina
has been appointed inspector of the revenue at Charlotte Harbor
and that he is now in this neighborhood on his way thither.”—
There is not a settlement or habitation South of Manatee, a small
stream emptying into Tampa Bay at least seventy miles Westerly
from Charlotte Harbor—with the latter there is not the slightest
intercourse except by an occasional fishing canoe from Tampa or
vessel dispatched there on Indian matters—At Manatee there is a
thrifty settlement to which vessels resort with supplies, but very
rarely—this stream however, as stated, empties into Tampa Bay
and is presumed to be within the revenue district of the off of that
dept stationed at F* Brooke. It is certainly convenient & accessible
to him at all times.
If this appointment & location has been deemed necessary to
prevent smugling, the precaution can only result in a useless waste
of public money—Charlotte Harbor, and the Keys which form it,
lies in its whole extent proximate to & opposite, seaward, the Indian
boundary and—saving a few individuals hear after referred to-
there are none but Indians to depredate upon the revenue—The

positions of those people.
I beg the subject may be presented to the early attention of the
Secy of War & by him to the notice of the Treasury Dept. in the
hope that the subject may be reviewed and the locale of this revenue
officer at least be changed.
Within a few months several white men have taken post on one
of the Keys lying between Pease Creek & Carloosahatchie (See map)
and opened an active whiskey traffic with the Indians—It is abso-
lutely necessary those intruders Sh" be removed: but before proceeding
to do so, thro’ the Marshal, I request that inquiry may be made
at the general land office to ascertain whether any authority has
been granted for said occupency.”

C. TAYLOR, Esq." Enterprise, Lake Monroe Florida.
SIR, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18"
ultimo.”
In regard to establishing, for the accommodation of the new settlers
in Florida, a land office at Enterprise, on Lake Monroe, and a mail
communication from Pilatka by Enterprise to Tampa, they being
subjects entirely within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of the
General Land Office and the Post Master General, you should address
those officers in relation to them.
As to your complaint that the new settlers have not been aided
as they should have been with arms and subsistence, so far as this
Department is concerned, every thing has been done, that with
propriety could be under existing laws.
It is confidently believed that your fears of molestation or danger
from the Indians remaining in Florida are groundless, as recent
and authentic information indicates that there is no reason for sup-
posing any such disposition on the part of the Indians if they are not
interfered with.
Your reflections and insinuations in regard to General Worth are
regarded as entirely unjust and unfounded. Aside from his well
known patriotism, zeal and vigilance, the Department has ample
assurance, in the measures he has adopted, and in the peace and
tranquillity which has prevailed between the citizens and the Indians,
that he has omitted nothing requisite to ensure protection and safety
to the citizens of Florida.

HON W* WILKINS Secretary of War
SIR A letter from Hon D Levy to the President, dated 14"August,
last,” relating to the commencement of works of fortifications on the
Florida reef, including Key West, and the Dry Tortugas, having just
been referred by you to this Office, I have the honor to report in rela-
tion thereto
That some five or six weeks since I had a conversation with M"
Levy on this subject, in which I stated to him that in my opinion it
was premature now to expend money in erecting works on any posi-
tion in that reef, because the same money could be, as yet, expended
to greater effect, as regards general results elsewhere; but as Con-
gress had, by making a specific appropriation, decided to now begin
on that reef, it was not for me to say that it was too soon.-That
accordingly, I should willingly begin the moment we were in posses-
sion of the necessary information. That this, however, was a com-
plicated problem, not to be solved in a moment, nor by piece-meal-
That we must know accurately all the harbors accessible to men of

whole reef, and a Survey of each man of war harbor, which I had
officially called for six months ago.—See letter from this Office to
Secretary of War, dated 30" January 1844.”
As expressive of the views of this Department, I beg leave to refer
you in a particular manner, to that letter—which sets forth, in some
detail, the necessity and importance of fortified points upon the Reef
in question; the matters to be considered in selecting positions; and
the exact knowledge indispensable to the establishment of a system
of defence that—notwithstanding the most rigorous and deeply stud-
ied economy, must to fulfil its great object involve the expenditure
of a large sum of money. That letter calls specially for information,
without which, to proceed will be to act with blinded eyes.—
I am not certain as to the disposition made of the call but presume
it was put in such train of execution as the importance of the subject
was deemed to demand.
Congress having decided to proceed with these defences, it will be
the duty of this Office to prosecute them with all the vigor warranted
by the extent of future appropriations. And the existing appropria-
tion will be applied as designed, at the earliest day possible. But
first of all, the information necessary to a proper desposition of these
funds must be obtained.
It would be very easy, now, with our present imperfect knowledge.
to expend in an off-hand way, all the money Congress has granted,
and much more too, in the erection of Batteries on the Florida Reef;
a pressing political exigency might arise (or it may without my knowl-
edge now exist) exacting all that impromptu energy and zeal could
achieve: but I do not suppose the Government would be satisfied
with the one course, or that it regards any such need as demanding
common prudence to be set at nought.—on the contrary, I suppose
Government and Congress to look to their agents for the best appli-
cation of these means, that it is in their power to make, and such a
supposition implies, of course, resort to all the preliminary investiga-
tions bearing upon the great questions of adaptation efficiency and cost.
Such a supposition does not imply that the precautions demanded
by experience and forecase, in cases easy and of merely local impor-
tance are to be disregarded in this instance, much complicated and
involving interest only national and great.—
Unless some pressing exigency really exist, I trust such course will
be pursued as will permit the defences of the Florida Reef to be the
subject of investigation under the most favorable circumstances for
the able and judicious solution of a proposition so important. The
first steps in that course are indicated in my letter above referred

to.—In the mean time, I heartily desire that the preliminary Surveys
and reconnaissance, therein asked for, may be prosecuted, and the
results presented with all practicable dispatch. The grant of money
by Congress (since the date of my letter) has settled the question of
order of commencement: and we have to presume, that Congress
desires the period to be the earliest, connected with a proper
commencement.
I can promise the zealous labors of the Officers of the Department
in every way that may expedite the matter, after the requisite facts
shall have been deposited with them. You are of course aware,
that this office is not entrusted with the duty of making such Surveys

On the 11" June 1844, the charges, against Mr. W. Y. Conway
Surveyor General of Florida, of malfeasance in office, and peculation,
were filed in the general land office, as specified in paper (A).
To those charges Mr. Conway filed his answer marked (B) on the
17th August 1844."
Without remarking upon the efforts of Mr. Conway to put by the
investigation of those charges, by evidence to sustain or to repel
them, as had been ordered, and without travelling out of the answer
of Mr. Conway and the documents in the general land office and in
the Office of the Comptroller, these facts are apparent. On the 19th
June 1843," Mr. Conway addressed a letter to the Commissioner of
the general land office, informing of the death of the son of W. Y.
Conway, who at his death was a clerk in the office of the Surveyor
General of Florida at a salary of one thousand dollars per year,
asking permission to divide, “the three thousand dollars” (appropri-
ated for the salaries of three clerks) between the two, They are willing
to do the additional work” &c (as appears in paper E. To this the
commissioner answered by letter of the 28* June 1843,” saying
“while holding you to a strict accountability under your official
bond for the faithful and diligent discharge of your official duties
in all their details”, you are permitted, “so to apportion the legal
appropriation for clerk hire, among the Clerks in whose skill and
ability you repose confidence, as to secure the greatest amount of
public benefit to your branch of the public service. You will there-
fore act in the premises according to the best dictates of your own

the 30" June 1843, Mr. Conway drew quarter yearly for the salaries
of his two clerks at the rate of $375, per quarter year to each paid to
the two for each quarter only five hundred dollars & retained to his
own use too hundred and fifty dollars for each quarter out of the $750.
drawn by him quarter yearly on account of Clerk's salaries. The
clerks agreed with Mr. Conway for the salary of one thousand dollars
per year to each; and that Conway should charge the government
as for the salary of fifteen hundred dollars per year to each, and that
Conway should retain to himself the said excess of one thousand
dollars per year out of the appropriation for pay of clerks, so as to
increase his salary from two thousand dollars per year as established
by law, to three thousand dollars per year: and this agreement so
made by Mr. Conway with his clerks who held their offices at his
will and pleasure, he has carried into execution actually and practically.
Such agreement so made and so practised upon by the said Conway
as surveyor general of Florida, was a gross abuse of the trust reposed
in him by the government, a flagrant malfeasance in office, an unfair
practise by him committed upon his Clerks who held at his pleasure.
The wrathful abuse which Mr. Conway has lavished upon his Clerks
Nunes & Prevost, since they have disclosed those facts, are impotent
to do away the facts, seeing that they are confessed in Mr. Conway's
answer in pages two and three. After such facts so clearly appearing,
confessed by Mr. Conway's answer in his own hand writing, I for-
bear to remark upon the matters contained in the charges and specifica-
tions and his responses. I recommend to the president that Mr.
W. Y. Conway, be removed from the office of Surveyor General of
Florida.48

ACTING GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE

[FSL: Govr. Exec. Corres. : M *]
Executive Office—TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA, September 12" 1844
SIR, Since my letter to you of the 16" ult." (to which I have not
as yet received a reply) I have ascertained that the amount of Ap-
propriation made by Congress in 1839," for the erection of public
buildings in this Territory, was, at the request of the Governor,
placed in certain Banks, and made subject to the order of the Treas-
urer of the Territory. I presume there can be no objection to pur-
suing the same course, with regard to the Appropriation made at the
last session, for the completion of the Capitol in this City. I would,
therefore, respectfully request that you would pay, or cause to be
paid to the Treasurer of Florida, or his order, (to be placed to the
credit of the fund for finishing the Capitol) the amount of the appro-
priation made for that object. Henry L. Rutgers Esq is at present,
the Treasurer of the Territory.
The accommodation of the Legislature at its approaching Session,
as well as the preservation of the building itself, renders its early
completion a matter of much importance to the Territory."
I am very respectfully Your ob" Serv"

thousand dollars were appropriated “for the survey of private claims
in Florida, and their connection with the adjacent public lands, at a
rate not exceeding five dollars a mile”—and of the appropriation of
$110,000—made by the Same Act “for surveying the public lands,
in addition to the unexpended balance of former appropriations, to
be apportioned to the several districts according to the exigencies of
the public service, exclusive of surveys in Louisiana,” the sum of
fourteen thousand three hundred dollars has been apportioned to
Your District for new surveys, and seven hundred dollars for inci-
dental expenses.
The sum of $15,000 thus apportioned to your Office being much
less than the amount asked for by you, and embraced in the estimates
submitted by this Office to Congress, it may be proper to state in
explanation, that only about two thirds of the amount of general
appropriation required by this Office, was appropriated by Congress,
consequently the same proportion of the amounts estimated for by
the Surveyor General, will necessarily be apportioned to their respec-
tive Districts.
It has been determined to pay out all the appropriations for sur-
veys, provided by the above mentioned Act, directly from the Treas-
ury Department, to the Deputy Surveyors entitled to receive them,
and in making a Contract, it should be specifically set forth in the
Contract, that the Deputies will receive their compensation direct
from the Treasury Department, upon the receipt of their accounts at
this Office, properly receipted by them, and certified by the Surveyor
General, accompanied by the approved plats of the Surveys for which
such accounts are rendered, and it should also be set forth in the
Contract, that the Surveyor General reserves to himself the right to
appoint a Deputy to examine the work at the expense of the Deputy
who executed it, whenever, in his judgment the public interest re-
quires it.
The establishment of this rule, which, of course is a general one,
and intended to apply also in the disbursement of all future appro-
priations, for Surveys, will relieve the Surveyors General from all
trouble in making disbursements, except in paying the salaries of
their Clerks, and the incidental expenses of their respective Offices.
I have thought much upon the change, and am well satisfied, that
whilst it will afford great relief to the Surveyors General, it will, in
other respects, greatly promote the public interest.
The undrawn balance of your apportionment of the appropriation
of 3" March 1843," will be remitted to you as heretofore, to pay for
495 STAT. 637.

the surveys Contracted for by you under instructions heretofore
issued.
The appropriation of $5000 above mentioned will, it is belived,
enable you to have all the private claims located in the region of
Country which has been surveyed; and where you are perfectly
satisfied that any Deputy will have extraordinary difficulty in sur-
veying the lands, or locating the private claims within the Contract
allotted to him, you may allow such Deputy five dollars per mile
for every mile and part of a mile of the boundaries of the private
claims located by him within such contract;—You will however, use
every care and precaution to prevent imposition, and only make the
allowance where you are perfectly satisfied that the difficulties to be
encountered by the Deputy are of an extraordinary character, and
such as will justify the allowance.
For the Kind of private claims to be surveyed under this appro-
priation, I refer you to my letter of the 14" June last,”—And for
the manner of surveying them to the instructions of 20" October
1843 * and 28th February 1844.”
From your annual report, and the best information that can be
obtained, it appears important that the tract of county between
ranges 16 and 19, inclusive and Townships 13 and 19 inclusive,
should be resurveyed if, on examination it appears, as stated, that
the marks of the old surveys within those limits have been obliterated.
The new surveys on the Gulf coast, should include such of the lands
on the Suwannee, within Thomas' district as can be surveyed;—
those South of Township 16 between Weightmans and Prevosts’
districts & South of those districts to the lands surveyed by Ran-
dolph; and South of Reeds district to Charlotte Harbor. The
surveys on the Atlantic border will include the unsurveyed lands
north of Washington's districts, –South of Houston's recent contract,
and between Whitner's and Jone's Districts; the money apportioned
to you to be applied in equal parts as near as possible to such of the
surveys above mentioned, on the Gulf and Atlantic Coast, as will
be most Conducive to the public interests.
If you are perfectly satisfied from the examination heretofore
made that an entire resurvey is necessary, if the lands beforementioned,
between Ranges 16 and 19 inclusive, and Townships 13 and 19
inclusive, you will have the whole of them resurveyed in exact ac-
cordance with the original field notes. To indicate the lines thus
resurveyed, and the corners thus established, you will use some

plain and distinct mark different from the ordinary mode of marking,
yet easy to be made and understood, so that the settlers will be
able readily to distinguish the lines and Corners of this resurvey.
The instructions of the 20" October last,” before referred to, will
govern you in making your new Surveys; numbering the Sections
&c—and those of the 24" January last,” directing the mode of sur-
veying the improvements of Settlers under the Armed occupation
Act are modified in consequence of the passage of the Act of 15"
June last," amendatory of the Armed Occupation Act, so that the
Settlers in all cases “in which settlements have been made under
the provisions of said Act, upon lands not Surveyed before the issue
of permit, —the Settler may, after survey locate his quarter Section
in any legal subdivision of Continuous or contiguous Sections, or
fractional Sections, so as to make up the quantity of one hundred
and sixty Acres [as near]" as may be, and to include his improve-
ments, and as much of the lands described in his permit as is con-
sistent with the system of the public surveys;”—that is he can take
continuous or contiguous half quarter Sections, so as to include
his improvements and as much of the land desired by him, not ex-
ceeding one hundred and Sixty Acres, as can be embraced by regular,
legal subdivisions or half quarter Sections of the same or different
Sections.
You will immediately contract for this work, using rigid economy,
and endeavour to have it done as low as possible consistant with
correctness;—And under no Circumstances will you exceed the maxi-
mum per mile fixed by law, or the amount apportioned to your Office
for the survey of the public lands, and for surveying private claims,
the amount appropriated for that object; And that there may be no
risk on this point, you will so estimate the amount of surveying in
each contract, that the amount estimated shall certainly exceed the
actual amount of surveying to be done in it.
In ordinary cases you will be governed by the instructions of 5"
August 1840 "—regulating the size of the Contracts, and the time to
be allowed for their completion;—but particular Cases may arise
where the interests of the Government may be advanced by enlarg-
ing the size of the Contracts, and extending the time for their com-
pletion. In such cases you will exercise a sound discretion, bearing
in mind, however, that in all cases the plats for the surveys of one year

must be forwarded to this Office in time to be embraced in the procla-
mations of sales for the next, so that a fresh supply of lands may be
annually brought into market, and the object of the appropriations
be carried out, in extending the settlements, and increasing the
public revenue. Consequently no Contract should be given out
which will require such a length of time for its completion, that the
plats cannot be returned in time for the sales of the next Season.
It is probable that most of the marks of the old Surveys in Your
District were made by blazing pine trees, or deeply marking them so
as to wound the tree. The turpentine exsuded from the wounds
thus made, and flowed to the ground; and when the grass was fired
in the fall, the flame would follow up the turpentine & burn out the
marks made by the Surveyors. The wound in the tree would thus
be enlarged, and the same consequences would follow, till the tree
was burnt off, and in this way, it is supposed, the marks of the former
surveys have been destroyed. To guard against accidents of this
kind, you will instruct your Deputies in no case to mark pitch pine
trees, but where suitable corner trees of other wood cannot be found,
they must use stakes of hard wood squared to about six inches, into
which they will deeply burn or mark the number of the Section,
Township and Range, covering the top of the stake with tar & char-
ing the end that is to be inserted in the ground. These stakes should
be firmly planted in the ground, and mounds raised around them
about three feet high. The witness trees should not be of pitch pine,
where others can be obtained, but where they cannot, the pine trees
should be simply marked in the bark in such a manner that the mark
would be distinct, yet not so as seriously to wound the tree.
The plan of blazing the lines adopted by your Deputies should be
abandoned, as that is the common mark for roads, tracts &" and in
lieu of it they should indicate the lines run by them, by two or three
chopps or hacks on the trees. Five Townships will be subdivided
in each contract given out, to be selected by the Deputy with a view
to the accommodation of settlers, and a ready sale of the lands. You
will therefore require of each Deputy an affidavit, that the Townships
subdivided were occupied by Settlers, or contained the best lands in
his contract: and where he reports any part of his contract as “im-
practicable,” you will require his affidavit to that effect and a full
statement of the causes that render it so. You will also require
your Deputies to approach the Gulf coast as near as practicable, &
where they cannot survey to the actual coast, they will state that fact,
and not meander the swamp bordering the Gulf, nor close their lines
upon it, but leave them as unfinished surveys. Part of the Gulf
Coast, it is stated, is cut up by streams, bayous &" into a multitude
of Islands or Keys the Surveys of which would cost probably more

than the land would yield to the Government. In such cases the
Deputy will restrict his operations to the main land, and not attempt
the survey of those Islands as Keys.
You will be careful to have your Deputies correct their chains by
the standard in your Office, and instruct them to ascertain at least in
every Township, and as much oftener as necessary and state in their
field notes so that it may be indicated upon the Township plats, the
variation of the Magnetic Meridian; and where the Township bound-
aries, and Section lines are seen by different variations, that fact
should be stated in the field notes, and introduced as a note upon the
Township plat. In executing the resurveys above directed, they
should also ascertain, and note down, the variations by which all the
lines were run.
In every case in which you have doubt, you will please confer
with this Office; and in all cases where you have reason to suspect the
correctness of the work done by any of your Deputies, the necessary
investigations should be immediately instituted;—And that every
preliminary precaution may be taken to insure correctness in the
returns, you will require the Deputies to give ample and satisfactory
security for the faithful performance of their contracts; and in addition
to the usual oath or affirmation required of them in entering upon each
contract, you will notify them that the following oath or affirmation
will be required to be affixed by them to the Field notes of each
Township. Vizt.

SIR, By the Act of 17* June last, entitled “An Act making appro-
priations for the Civil and diplomatic expenses of Government
for the fiscal year ending the thirtieth day of June 1845, and for
other purposes,” four thousand five hundred dollars were appro-
priated “for Compensation of the Surveyor General of Florida and
the Clerks in his Office” and of the appropriations heretofore made
for the same object, a balance of fifteen hundred and fifty four 25/100
dollars still remains to your credit, making together the sum of six
thousand and fifty four 25/100 dollars; of which, however, you cannot
expend more than $875 for Clerk hire in any one quarter, that being
one fourth of the amount allowed your Office for that object by
the organic law of 9" May 1836.” One thousand dollars were
also appropriated “for Salary of an Assistant Surveyor, to survey
the private claims in Florida under the direction and supervision
of the Surveyor General of Florida;” and fifteen hundred dollars
“for pay of chain carriers, markers, transportation, provisions &" "
In disbursing these appropriations you will use rigid economy and
whenever possible, have the work done by the piece as directed by
existing instructions, rather than giving a regular annual salary.
Under the appropriation of $1000 “for Salary of an Assistant
Surveyor &" Col Francis L. Daney has been appointed to that Office
and will be ordered to report himself to you for instructions, you
will require him to take the usual oath of Office & to execute a Bond

to you with good and sufficient security in the sum of five thousand
dollars, for the faithful performance of his duties.
The duties of this Office will be to aid you in making all such
examinations, either in the Office or field, as you may deem necessary;
touching the survey of private claims in your District, to survey
such private claims as you may direct, and in fact, under your super-
vision and direction to do any and every matter connected with
the Surveys of private claims in your District, which you may deem
essential or important to the public interest. The appropriation
of $1500 for pay of chain carriers &" will be applied as therein specified
to the payment of incidental expenses growing out of the examinations
or surveys to be made by this Office.
In making up your Salary accounts, you will make separate charges
under each distinct appropriation, and where piece work is given out,
a detailed statement of the work done should accompany the quarterly
accounts, with a tariff of the charges made for the work, certified
by the Surveyor General over his own signature to each statement,
that the statement and charges have been examined by him and
found correct, and a separate receipt from the Clerk who did the
work, should accompany the statement.
Although the Organic law gives $3.500 per annum for Clerk hire;"
it by no means follows that the Amount is to be expended and should
the business of your Office increase so as to render necessary the
employment of three Clerks, it would be better to restore the old
rate of Compensation of $1000 per Annum. And thereby restrict
the aggregate expenditure to that of the preceding year.

following form. Vizt:

SIR, You were apprised in my communication of the 19" Ulto *
that your remarks in reference to surveys ordered in Florida, for a
Rail Road across the peninsula, and for a Canal at the Haulover
would be laid before the chief Topogl. Engineer for his consideration.
He has examined your reply to his letter of instructions of 24 July,"
and now calls your attention to the following extract from that
communication.
“It has been represented to me, that ground highly eligible of a Rail
road exists between Jacksonville and Post N° 4, near the Cedar Keys,
and that all the difficulties of the route will be found between the har-
bor and this post. The distance from post N° 4 to big Kay, is about
one mile and a half. This space will recieve your earliest and most
careful attention, in order to determine the practicability of passing
over it with a railroad; the probable cost of that distance, and its
length. Having ascertained the route which the road should pursue
over this space, and the point of the first land near post N° 4, with
which it will communicate, you will then have the survey continued
from that post to Jacksonville. It is not doubted that a previous re-
connoissance of the ground will enable you to mark out the path for
this survey with sufficient Accuracy to justify from its results a safe
preliminary estimate, and a basis from which the road which hereafter
may be constructed, can be definitely located.”
The Chief Topogl. Engr directs that you ascertain as a preliminary
measure, all circumstances connected with this western terminus, for
whether Pilatka or Jacksonville be the Eastern terminus, it in no
wise affects the Western; it is known that the two former points afford
good harbors, and that they are easily accessible both from the sea

and from the land, but in the case of the western terminus it is not
known whether a good communication between the harbor at Cedar
Keys and the main can be established by Railway. This question
therefore will first receive your attention, and your surveys upon the
Western side of the peninsula will be extended inland as far as Fort
Walker, or some other point in the neighbourhood of the Alachua
Prarie or Orange Lake, a point which would be common to both lines
across the peninsula, one by Jacksonville and one by Pilatka. When
the facts are collected you will report the results to this Bureau to-
gether with an estimate of funds necessary to complete the surveys
of both lines, in case the sum now appropriated should be found to
be insufficient.
In reference to the Haulover Canal; inasmuch as you have been
notified by the General commanding the troops in Florida that he can
afford you no assistance in officers or men, you will proceed after
having completed the Surveys for the Railroad, to make such exam-
inations as will enable you to state the cost of constructing a Canal
at the Haulover independently of any aid from the troops."
As there are no officers of the Corps unemployed, you are author-
ized to engage an assistant at a rate not exceeding three dollars per
day.

condition of the Seminoles in Florida, and is fully impressed with the
belief that under your command a safe and pacific disposition has
been established and manifested amongst those Indians, yet, it is
thought that the safer policy requires their removal from the Terri-
tory. Their emigration would be an act of humanity towards the
Indian—would be safety to him from any wanton or provoked out-
break, and would save the inhabitants of Florida from all uneasiness,
whether real or groundless.
You will, therefore, resort, without delay, to the adoption of all
peaceful means to induce the remnant of Indians in Florida to emi-
grate to the country West of the Mississippi river. Military force
will be avoided, and the arts of persuasion be alone resorted to—
and then, presuming your influence and persuasion thus exercised,
will be successful, the emigration will be conducted with gentleness
and humanity. Those Indians, if they have any reflection or sagac-
ity, must be convinced that their present residence is only tempo-
rary, and that their safety and ultimate happiness must depend upon
their removal and joining their brethren in the West. No one can
be responsible for the continuance of perfect tranquillity—one mis-
chievous white man, or one revengeful Indian, may disturb the whole
country and produce much disaster.
In making your arrangements for the emigration, the Indians will
be informed that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs is now in prog-
ress with a negotiation by Commissioners to adjust the difficulties
that have heretofore disturbed both the Creeks and Seminoles and
prevented a portion of the latter under Wild Cat and others from
settling upon their own land West of the Mississippi, and that final
measures will will be adopted, very probably this fall, by the Govern-
ment to assign or secure homes for the future residence of the Sem-
inoles according to their wishes.
In giving these instructions it is necessary I should express the
opinion that they cannot be considered as an infraction of the Mili-
tary arrangements made by you in July and August 1842.” If it is
now reasonably apprehended that safety to the Indians themselves
and the tranquillity of the Territory require the change neither party
should object, particularly when the Government will conduct the
change agreeably to justice & humanity. The arrangement to which
I refer must always yield to public policy.

[NA:GLO, Corres. Relating to Armed Occupation:C]
Copy CEDAR KEYS Oct 25* 1844
THO" H. BLAKE Esq Com Gen. Land Office
RESP" SIR Last winter I wrote you making enquiries &c relative
to the islands on the Coast of Florida & whether they could be held
under the Armed Occupation Act,” to which you replied that they
could not & that the Permit to Augustus Steele for Depot Key about
which I particularly called your attention, was directed to be an-
nulled ”—but to which notification so far as Mr Steele is concerned
not the least regard has been paid, he having continued to exercise,
and that arbitrarily, as full authority in and about the island as
though he were the bona-fide owner, pulling down & erecting build-
ings-selling rights to land and taking them away again, because he
deems himself free from any obligation to comply by the terms of the
law under which he pretends to hold—and so far as the notification
is concerned, he defies the Government to deprive him, as he says, of
his rights, and that he will show the Department whether they can
set aside a law of Congress & permits, issued by the Land Officers
at Newmansville for the occupation of Land under that law, by sub-
stituting their own will. He forgetting that any laws having reference
to the subject of lands, and using language belonging to the science of
Geography, that the words must be construed to have the same mean-
ing in the law, that they have in the science—thus as the law was for
the Armed Occupation of the peninsula of Florida, it could not em-
brace islands on the coast. Independent of those other considerations
which as I stated in my former letter were fatal in my estimation
to the validity of his grant,-yet now from not having cultivated
land as the law requires—within the year of the date of his permit
he has in addition forfeited all claim to the island.
In the letter before referred to, I suggested & allow me again to
urge the importance of having the island surveyed & laid out in lots &
sold at public sale, the longer this is delayed, the greater the difficulty
become, from the erection of Buildings of various kinds—as at pres-
ent it is the Depot of the trade of the Suwannee, and there are now
2 wharves, one about 400 ft & the other rising 500 feet long, 4 ware-
houses from 100 to 140 ft long besides stores & dwellings; most of
which Buildings he purchased at the Govt sale for $227. I think it
was, by agreeing with others that he only should bid, & which Build-
ings must have cost Gov" $50,000. I have no doubt the sale could beset
aside by proving collusion which can readily be done. I would also

suggest (if it would not be thought intruding my opinion on the Secy
of the Treasury) that Mr Steele be instantly removed from his office
here as Collector of the Port (Deputy of St Marks but the only officer
here) as it is wrong for any one to be continued as an Officer under
Govt & at the same time opposing & defying them.
There is another subject to which I would wish to call your atten-
tion & which is alike due from me as every other citizen. There
is a man here of the name of W" Crawford who took up one of these
Islands, also under the Armed Occupation Act, but who is now trying
at the land office at Newnansville to make an exchange for it, for
what is called Black Island, pretending it is Main land, tho the water
surrounds it & it was entered under that law, by a person of the name
of Wolk as an island, he being taken to it & shewn it as such by the
same Crawford. But what I wished particularly to name is, that he
has for sometime past been cutting Live Oak therefrom for sale, which
is in violation of law. I presume you will take immediate action in
the case—he has a partner or Partners, I believe in the business, a
mercantile house here, but there are men here who can testify, posi-
tively on both those subjects which I cannot not having been on the
Island since Crawford took possession, but Tho" H. Parsons Tho"
Duffield, Tho" Seelman Alex Calligan & others can.
By addressing me at Columbus Col Cy E.F. I should receive any
reply you may deem proper to favor me with.

to “any excess of expenditure heretofore made beyond former appro-

cation the purpose of Congress in “completing and rendering secure

the propriety of my paying off such arrearages as may have accrued

SIR, On the application of the Hon: I. H. Bronson, Judge of

that such of the public buildings at Fort King as shall be necessary
for the accommodation of the courts when holding their session for
Marion County, be placed in the possession of the Marshall of

with the approbation of General Worth, turn over to the Marshall
the necessary buildings for the sessions of the Court and for Offices
for its several Officers, taking his obligation that he, or his successors
in Office, shall restore them to the agent of the Quarter Masters
Department should they become necessary for military purposes.
As other buildings may be required for the accommodation of the
court and the citizens who may attend it, you are authorized to
rent any of them, not at present required by the public, to responsible
citizens who may desire to occupy them. The conditions will be
to keep them in good repair & restore them whenever required

SIR, Your letter of the 28" ult, with its inclosures, is received"—
The instructions you ask, appear in the proviso of the appropriation
in question. It is not in my power to render their import and design
more clear.
If expenditures exceeding the amount of the former appropriation
of 3" March, 1839,” have been incurred upon contracts entered into
without authority of Congress, they must be provided for by the
local authority which directed them.
Such is the general policy of Congress in regard to Territorial
expenditures as appears by the second Section of the act of 29"
Aug. 1842.”—In this particular case, every doubt as to the proper
application of the appropriation of the last session is put at rest
by the express enactment, that it shall not be construed to sanction
any excess of expenditure beyond former appropriations for that
object. However inconvenient it may be to require the authority

SIR, There was an appropriation during last session of Congress for
removing obstructions to the navigation of the rivers Choctahatchie &
Holmes, ten thousand dollars; and also for the removal of obstructions
to the navigation of the River St Marks above the confluence of the
Wakulla river 2500 dollars.”
The only information we have in reference to the first (Chocta-
hachee & Holmes.) will be found in the inclosed letters.” In reference
to the second it has been stated that the difficulties to be removed
are impending trees & snags.
The first enters into Choctahatchie bay, which communicates with
Pensacola bay by Santa Rosa Sound.
It is presumed that the difficulties on each River consist in Snags
rafts and impending trees, but without precise information directions
in reference to the work cannot be given.
You will therefore as soon as practicable make an examination of
these rivers and report results to this office. Lieut Smith will ac-
company you & funds to meet the expenses of the examination will be
furnished on your requistion.”

SIR. Enclosed I have the Honor to transmit you my Accounts for
the Nov" Term of the Court which I trust will be found correct. In
relation to Geo Stafford Special Jailors bill, I have to state that we
have no secure Jail here, for two reasons, first because it is in a ruinous
condition and Second because it is situated half a mile from the town,
in the bushes, and if repaired could be broken at any moment, with
assistance from the outside, which has invariably been done heretofore
when any prisoners were confined there, and in order to keep prisoners
we have to hire a house in town and keep a regular guard to watch it—
The Jailor has had nearly the whole time ten or twelve prisoners in
custody, and has charged only as for one man at the rate of three
Dollars per day, which I consider reasonable, and hope it may be
allowed without any further explanation.”

CITIZENS OF EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 28 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[Referred December 16, 1844]
To the honorable the Speaker, and House of Representatives in Congress
Assembled
The undersigned Citizens of East Florida, beg leave to petition
your honorable body, for the opening and establishment of a public
Road from S." Augustine to S' Lucia on St Lucia Sound via New
Smyna—Your petitioners ask leave to state that within the last twelve
Months, the number of enterprising emigrants who have taken out
permits and Commenced Settlements on the St Lucia Sound and
its vicinity, under the Army occupation bill, amounts, including
their families, to about Twelve hundred Souls. These hardy adven-
turers, thus located near Three hundred miles South from S' Augus-
tine, which is the nearest, of the old Settlements, have had to encounter
incredible privations and hardships. They are Composed principally
of persons of limited means, whose enterprising spirits, and indomi-
table Courage, to surmount all pecuniary embarrasments, and forego
all the comforts of the “old fireside” have been induced to meet
hardships and fatigue, to which they were heretofore strangers, with
a Cherfulness truly Commendable.
Most of them have had to Make their tours of Exploration and
Settlement, (After arriving at St Augustine) by what is termed the
inland passage.—I—E—in Small boats and Canoes through the
intricate and dificult Lagoons marshes and mangrove Islands, of
Mosquito and Indian Rivers, (interrupted by several haulovers,

which can only be passed with extraordinary and painful labor:)
over a Space of from Three to Four hundred miles. The greater
portion of these hardy and worthy emigrants have yet to remove
their families, moveables and Stock, to do by the above described
inland navigation, rout, is utterly impossible! To do so by Coast
navigation, around Gape Cape Canaveral, is dangerouse, expensive,
and equally as objectionable as the other rout—and these two methods
of travel or transportation, are now the only two that can be embraced
by either the Emigrant Traveler or invalid, Formily the Old King's
Road was open and in good order from S" Augustine to New Smyrna,
But during the late Seminole War it has been destroyed, or by natural
decay, become impassible. It is now in Contemplation to recommence
the settlement of New Smyrna this fall—And already a large number
of Planters have returned to their plantations recently made desolate
by the Savage Seminole—near this once flourishing and prosperous
Settlement, When your honorable body reflects upon the facts
connected with the subject-matter for which your petitioners pray
the isolated situation of the settlers of New Smyrna—S" Lucie—Lake
Worth—and still farther down the eastern Coast of the peninsula—
their respectable and growing numbers and importance—the hard-
ships and sufferings they have encountered; they Confidently an-
ticipate that the fostering hand of a great and good Government
will be extended, and that your honorable body will make such
appropriations as in their wisdom they shall deem necessary to
open and establish a road from St Augustine to S' Lucie via New
Smyrna; And to that end Your petitioners as in duty bound will
ever pray.

15th of June 1844,” I am of Opinion particularly in view of the 40
Acre principle recognized in the 4* Section of it, that the Same prin-
ciple may govern in the locations contemplated by the 2" Section
of Said Act.
The 2"Section gives to Settlers the privilege of making Contiguous
Selections in tracts of any legal Subdivisions, and by that general
term, is understood tracts of eighty Acres, being the Smallest quantity
Subject to Sale, except under the Special Act of the 5" of April 1832,”
supplementary to the several laws for the sale of public lands, reducing
it to forty Acres where the Applicant files his Affidavit setting forth
the particulars specified in the Act.
That Act is not applicable to the cases of settlers under the Armed
Occupation Act. The 4* Section of the Amendatory Act of June
15th 1844, however authorizes the settler under the Original law, to
select forty Acre tracts where the title of the Government to the
premises located shall prove defective & I can perceive no propriety
for making a difference between the two classes of cases, or that the
smallest quantity mentioned may not be selected under it.
You will therefore consider my instructions of the 26" July last "
as rescinded, and permit settlers to make their selections under the
2" Section of the Act above referred to, in quarter quarter Sections
having respect to compactness of form.

* The annual report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, Dec. 10,
1844, communicated to the Senate by the Secretary of the Treasury, Dec. 16, 1844
(Senate Doc. 7, 28 Cong. 2 sess., p. 7), contains the following: “In Florida, the
sales have been very circumscribed, as it was thought probable her citizens had
not sufficiently recovered from their Indian troubles to be prepared for them;
and it might have had the effect of throwing her choice lands into the hands of
distant capitalists. From the surveys already returned, and those now in prog-
ress, heavy sales may be expected there in the course of the coming year. The
act of 15th June last, amendatory of the ‘Florida armed occupation act, has
afforded salutary relief in many instances; and although there may be a few cases
of hardship not within its purview, these, as they may come up, will present fair
subjects for legislative relief. Whilst on this subject, I beg leave to renew the
recommendation in my last annual report, that provision be made by law for
remunerating the local officers in Florida for their arduous duties incident to the
proceedings under that act, and that a table of fees be established for all the local
land offices, to prevent the renewal of complaints by our citizens, of having to
pay charges unauthorized by law, sometimes reasonable enough in amount, but
in others onerous and extortionate. The boundary line between this Territory
and the State of Georgia still remains unsettled, after various efforts, commencing
twenty years back, directed to that object, by Congress, the State, and this office.
It is a matter of interest to the General Land Office, inasmuch as the surveys
cannot be closed in that quarter until the line is established. The boundary
line between this Territory and Alabama is also unsettled, never having been
ascertained by actual survey; and this office has been informed that there is a
strip of country between them, over which neither the State nor Territory exer-
cise jurisdiction, designated the “Neutral Ground'.”

completing and rendering secure and tenantable the State-House

and will be paid and charged to that appropriation. Allow me to
suggest in accordance with the Comptroller, that the drafts hereafter
drawn, may expressly state that they are drawn in execution of the
Act of 17* June 1844 *—and to submit whether it would not be more
regular to draw them in favor of the Treasurer of the Territory and

SIR. During the last Summer Lt Ebenezer Farrand of the U.S.
Navy reported to me the names of a number of Trespassers upon
the lands of the U.S. Situated in this District, in conformity with
instructions which he had received from the Navy Department.
Lt Farrand's examination was confined to a portion of St Rosa County,
which lies Contiguous to this County, and he found that in that por-
tion, about 50000 acres of land had been stripped of pine timber
which alone gave it any value.—His examination of the Country
was very minute and he procured very accurate information, both
as to the trespassers and the extent of depredation upon each eighth
of a section within the range of his enquiries, so that in carrying the
cases into court I was furnished with an amount of testimony rairly
obtainable in Such cases & which I thought abundlently Sufficient
to Sustain the prosecution in every case reported. Acting under
the implied instructions of the Navy Department which had directed

Lt Farrand to confer with me I prepared at the last term of the U.S.
Court for Santa Rosa County forty eight bills of indictment under
the Act of the 2" March 1831 * (Vol. 8. page 461) against the tres-
passers whose names had been reported to me by Lt Farrand, and
sent them before the Grand Jury with the witnesses to prove the
facts and the extent of the tresspasses
As I have reported to you in my general Semi-annual statement
every bill was ignored—It does not become me to report my Con-
jectures as to the cause of the failure of these bills, I will only mention
therefore as facts from which you may draw your own conclusions,
that the foreman of the G. Jury was charged with having cut down
more than 8000 acres of of the public lands, and a majority of the
Jury are also charged with being offenders under the same law. I
have also Since the bills are were ignored understood both from the
foreman & other members of the G. Jury that they were satisfied
notwithstanding the charge of the Judge, that the law of 1831 was
not intended to apply to persons cutting Pine timber on the Public
lands. I am myself of opinion that the law was designed primarily
to protect, the live oak, and red cedar growing upon the reserved
lands—the caption of the act—the phraseology of the whole act
and the duty of enforcing its penalties, being confided to the Secretary
of the Navy, all indicate the object of the law to have been to protect
timber valuable for Naval purposes from depredation, but it is
equally clear to my mind that the terms of the act enlarges its opera-
tion So as to include all tresspasses upon any public land who cut
and carry away any timber whatsoever I respectflly solicit from
you an opinion on this point and also further instructions as to my
duty in prosecuting this matter. There are two other counties
belonging to this judicial district, in either of whch the Subject
would be more impartially examined than it is possible to have it
done in Santa Rosa County Shall I lay the bills of indictment before
the Grand Jury of one of those other Counties? Lt Farrand reports
to me that there are many more tresspassers in Santa Rosa County
than those with whose names I have been furnished.
I have the honor further to report to you, that inasmuch as the
law of 1831 is restricted in its application, by the act of limitations
of April 30" 1790 " to tresspasses committed within the last two
years, and the tresspasses reported to me by Lt Farrand, had ex-
tended over a period of ten or fifteen years, I deemed it my duty

to institute a number of civil actions of tresspass in behalf of the
United States against the persons reported to me as trespassers.
These Suits were brought at the late term of Santa Rosa Court and
were continued to the Spring Term. A preliminary question was
however mooted and decided at this Term, upon which I respectfully
Solicit your opinion, as it will probably be taken to the Court of
Appeals, should there be a final judgment against any of the defend-
ants. The ground was taken by the Counsel of the defendants
that the U. States Courts in Florida have no right to entertain a
Common Law action of trespass, when the U States is the party
plaintiff. The position was maintained with much ingenuity, but
the plea was overruled by the Court—As the trespasses upon the
pine timber of this part of the Country have been very extensive, and
are being Carried on at this time upon a very extensive scale, the
interests of the Government demand, that its officers here should
be punished with the best advice and the most precise instructions.
The performence of my duty in this regard has already been met
with much feeling on the part of the alleged trespassers, but I shall
not be deterred from discharging my duty, by obstacles of that
nature, tho' it will make me solicitous not to transcend the bounds
which duty prescribes. I ask then respectfully for full and minute
instructions and that you may the better understand the whole
case I beg leave to refer you to Lt Farrands reports to the Secretary
of the Navy, of his agency in this business.

of the Navy upon this subject, I shall enclose to him a copy of this

money could be refunded, or other lands be entered.
As many of these are without doubt cases of hardship, which the

your files, and by correspondence with the parties interested, to pro-
cure the original receipts, or, where they have been lost, authentic

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 28 Cong., 1 sess. :DS]
[No date, 1844 c.]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,
the petition of the subscribers Citizens of East Florida respectfully
showeth that the policy of the General Government in respect to the
integrity of the various Indian tribes resident within the United
States was adopted and has been pursued for the purpose of pre-
serving their Identity as Independant nations that the attempt
to extend that policy to the Seminole tribes resident in Florida re-
sulted in a long and grievedus struggle between the United States
and the Seminoles, in consequence of the Endeavours of the former
to remove the latter from the vicinity of the white population of
this state to a country provided for them westward of the Mississippi
river. The Seminoles desired to remain in their native country.
& they So far Succedeed in their opposition to removeal that a Large
boddy of them Still remains, Settled by consent of goverment in the
Southern part of Florida—that the general goverment still pursueing
the same policy towards the Seminoles though foiled by the means
employed to remove them passed an act on the 4” of August 1842
Entitled an act to provide for the armed occupation & settlement
of the peninsula of East Florida * the Said act provides that any
person who shall settle with in the Seminole Country or the Limits de-
scribed in said act & reside therein for the period of five years accord-
ing to the Law Shall be entitled to a patent for one hundred & sixty
acres of Land or one quarter section as a Donation from the United
States
that the object the General Goverment intended to attain by
granting this donation of Land was the occupation & settlement
of the county acquired by the war from which the Seminoles had
retired or were driven. & also for the purpose of conveying to the
minds of the simple natives in a practical way the imposibility of
their remaining in the district of country Set apart for them in the
peace arrangements of General Worth. & the absolute necesity of
their ultimate removeal to a country where they would not be Ex-
posed to the inroads of the whites
that the opperation of Said act so far as it has been permitted
has been Extremely beneficial reduceing the Seminole reservation,
thereby promoteing the policy of the United States, & the welfare
of this State, peopling the Country abandoned by the indians &
placeing it it is hoped on Endureing & firm safeguard against further

hostile aggressions from the Seminoles. The Settlements made by
this act spread over the greater part of South Florida not now in
posession of the Indians are of the most permanent caracter & would
have been much more widely Extended had it not been for the Limi-
tation of the act itself & the assignment of a Large part of the Lands
appropriated for this purpose to the Seminoles who yet remain to
be removed
that the object of the Law (viz) the permanent Settlement of
the Country & the Exclusion of the Indians from the Soil So far as
the act itself & the attendant Circumstances would permit has been
fully accomplished & no good reason now remains why the provisions
of the Said act anexing Conditions to the donation may not be so
modified as to put the holders of permits into the immediate posession
of the Lands described therein
that Such an amendment of the Law will be productive of varied
benefits immediately to the Settler. Indirectly to the State, &
more remotely to the general Interests of the United States. For
the Settler would come at once into the Enjoyment of the fruits
of near four years toil & privation, the State revenue will be relieved
by the removeal of the Exemption from the Large body of Land
Claimed under this act, & the United States will have increased
demands for the public Lands adjacent to those donations
that your petitioners are Citizens of the United States & of this
State they have done Every duty as Such, paid taxes for the suport
of Goverment & caried armes in its defence & in fact have per-
formed all the duties accorded to them as Citizens to perform they
believe your Honourable Body did not intend to Load the Settler
with more duty than what might be Sufficient to Secure the object
of the Grant they are of opinion the uncertainty attending the Lo-
cation of permits & settlements thereto is a Serious impediment
to Locations by purchaseers or those who desire to purchase when
the remaining Lands come into market & your petitioners are of
opinion that at this precise time all proper means should be used to
increase the number of inhabitants in South Florida there is no
more effectual way to do this than by encourageing Emigration
from the neighboring States Finally that the policy of the United
States in respect to the preservation of the indian tribes as independ-
ant nations as far as contemplated by this act has been fully sustained
by its opperation, & the permanency of the settlements made under
the Same undoubted having put the country on the Seminole border
into the hands of the poor but hardy farmers who have Endured
innumerable privations & difficulties thus confineing the Seminoles
to the district assigned them within the borders of this State by
the general goverment & so not only fulfilling the intention of the

therefore your petitioners humbly pray your honourable body in
your wisdom & Justice to relieve us from so much of the opperation
of the armed occupation act by amending the same So that upon
proof made as required by Said Law the patents may issue forth
with to the Settlers whome permits have been granted & your pe-
tioners beg Leave respectfully to refer your Honourable body to

mending this matter to the Serious Consideration of Congress as

HON GEO. M. BIBB Secy of the Treay
SIR, I am informed by Capt. Nones of the U.S. Rev Cutter
Lagare who went to the port of Havana to fill his boiler with fresh
water, that the Fishing Smacks employed in this District when
they enter the Port of Havana either take off or cover up the names
of the Vessel on the Stern, and enter and leave the Port under Spanish
colors—On enquiry of them the cause of this, he was told that it
was to avoid tonnage tax—duties on fish &c—The fishing Smacks
employed in this District I have not the least doubt are really American
property. The impropriety of changing the character of these
Vessels, in entering a foreign port is very manifest but the case does
not seem to be provided for in the Revenue laws, and as far as I can dis-
cover, I am powerless in the matter, Hence I lay the whole before
the Department for its instructions. The origin of the American
fishing Smacks, being permitted to supply the Havana market with
fish is traced to the time that Com. Porter in Command of the Mexican
fleet occupied this harbor about the year 1826 & 7 His cruises
aided by the Columbian Privateers so cut up & annoyed the Commerce
of Cuba, that even the fishing Vessels could not venture out—Then
it was that Licenses or permissions were issued to American vessels
to Supply Havana with live fish—And Smacks owned wholly by
Americans have been employed at the business ever since. The
fishing on the Florida Coast is so much superior to that on the Cuba
side, as to pay well those engaged in it—The Spanish permissions or
licenses is not a Custom house document, but as I understand issues
from the Farmer of the fishing business—for it is a Government
Monopoly, farmed out in Havana. From 24 to $30.000 Dolls as
near as we can calculate has been the Yearly value of the fishing
business as heretofore carried on, between the Florida & Cuba which
amount is brought into this port in Specie. I never before had
any official information on this subject but have suspected that
in connection with the farmer of the Spanish Monopoly, the fisherman
evaded the Spanish regulations on the Cuba side. But they conform

[NA:JD, Sol. Treas., Opinions]
Office of the Solicitor of the Treasury. January 8, 1845.
SIR, I have recieved your letter of the 24" ult," and regret the
untoward circumstances attending the Bills of Indictment against
the persons complained of by Lt. Farrand for trespassing upon the
timber lands of the United States. For the results, you are in no
wise accountable. I concur with you in opinion that the terms of the
act of 2d. March, 1831,” comprehend the cases of those who cut and
remove pine timber, although the prime object was to protect Live
Oak for the use of the Navy. If the Juries but do their duty the
offenders will be made responsible for their unauthorized destruction
of public property. If the depredations were committed more than
two years since, so that the act of April 30, 1790," becomes a bar to an
indictment, resort to the action of Trespass seems highly proper if
it can be sustained. While there is a doubt on this point, as you
suggest there is, it will not be expedient to multiply cases until it
shall have been judicially determined." You ask my opinion upon
the ground taken by the Defendants, –that the U.S. Courts in Florida
have no right to entertain a Common Law action of Trespass, when
the U. States is the party plaintiff. I regret that you did not furnish
me with a brief of the argument in favor of this position, as it is always
unsatisfactory if not unsafe for a Stranger to the local laws and practice
of a State or Territory, to decide a mooted question in regard to such
laws or practice, without the aid of those whose residence and pur-

suits presuppose a minute knowledge of both. I must content myself,
under such circumstances, with the remark that, by the 1st. Section
of the act of May 15th. 1826." (3d. Story's Laws U.S. 2023.) the
Superior Courts of the Territory of Florida have original, but not
exclusive, jurisdiction of all suits in which the U. States are a party,
whatever may be the amount in controversy. Why they may not
bring an action of Trespass, I do not understand. If I have over-
looked any statutable provision conflicting irreconcileably with that
just cited, I will thank you to refer me to it, and, at the Same time,
furnish me with a brief of the arguments on both sides. Until the
point is determined, (and by your letter it appears that the defendants
intend to insist upon it,) I should not recommend the institution
of other Suits, unless there occur some flagrant case of Trespass,
which it may be important at once to Suppress. I shall submit
the general subject to the consideration of the Secretary of the Navy,
and advise you of the result.
It is certainly of importance that the cases should be brought in
a county, where a Jury can be found not obnoxious to the same charge,
and guilty of the offence upon which they are to pass, if it can be
done; of that you are best able to judge. You will press for an early
decision of the main question, and be cautious to preserve such evi-
dence as may come to your knowledge, for the purpose of proceeding
against those to whom it may apply. The idea that the U. States
cannot maintain a Common Law action is more fanciful than sound,
as I apprehend. The District Courts have a Common Law jurisdic-
tion, and so, in my judgment have the Territorial Courts in Florida.
The latter, by the law of 1826, are vested with jurisdiction of all
Suits in which the U.S. may be a party; and Suits embrace not only
what the Common Law recognized among its old proceedings,
but proceedings to ascertain legal rights, whether known or unknown
to the old Common Law of England."

cedar, or pine, are forbidden by Law, and that it is the duty of the
Department under the direction of the President, to cause the tres-
passes to be prevented, and those committing them to be proceeded
against. This may be done by civil suit or indictment.
Your suggestion to the District Attorney for West Florida in your
reply to his letter, copies of which were enclosed in your communica-
tion, not to multiply judicial proceedings until the question has been
settled seems to me to be very judicious and should govern him in
his action.
I am, respectfully Your obt. Servt.

ing my recommendation “respecting a provision for compensation to
the land Officers in Florida under the Armed occupation law”—
The recommendation to which you have reference also alludes to
the expediency of establishing by law a table of fees, “for all the local
land Offices, to prevent the renewal of complaints by our Citizens
having to pay charges unauthorized by law, sometimes reasonable
enough in amount, but in others onerous and extortionate.”
The cases alluded to are not considered as coming strictly within
the purview of the laws prescribing the duties of the Officers—being
the transcribing of papers on the files of the Office, to be used in ref-
erence to suits at law, and other purposes, frequently comprising
voluminous documents; also the copying of township maps and dia-
grams, and the transcribing of field or descriptive notes of surveys
for the particular information & use of individuals, both purchasers
and others.
Being satisfied that it would be of public utility to have such a
table of fees, I have in the accompanying draft of a Bill,” presented in
a separate section, a provision in reference to that object and which
can readily be detached should you not concur therein.
In relation to the special compensation provided in the 1st Section
for the Offices in Florida, I should explain, that it would give to each
of them for each permit the sum of two dollars—I have framed the
Section in this way in reference to the principle upon which the allow-
ance is to be made, and desire to be understood as submitting entirely
to you and the Committee the actual amount to be allowed.
I am very respectfully Sir, Your Obt Servt

SIR, In compliance with the request of the Register of the Treas-
ury Department, I transmitted to him, on the 13th Sept 1843,” the
usual estimates of the Appropriation necessary to defray the expenses
of the Legislative Council of this Territory, for the fiscal year, ending
30" June 1845. At that time, the number of representatives was 29,
and had been for several years previous, and this was the number
for whom pay & mileage was estimated by me, in the estimates above
referred to.
In February 1843, the County of Hernando (now Benton) was
organized by the Legislature, and in March 1844, the Counties of
26 Present.

St. Lucia and Marion. The representative from the former, was
permitted to take his seat in the House, at the last Session, and
those from the latter were allowed the same right at the present
session.
The question, as to the right of the Legislature, to increase the
number of representatives, beyond the number warranted by the
provisions of the Act of Congress of June 18th 1834* (since which no
other Act has been passed by Congress, apportioning representa-
tion in this Territory) was involved in the admission of the members
from the three new Counties, above mentioned. The claims of the
members elected from St. Lucia and Marion Counties, to seats in
the House, were referred to a Committee, who have decided in favor
of their right to admission, and their report has been concurred in
by the House. I herewith enclose to you a printed copy of the pro-
ceedings of the House on the 14" inst, containing the report of the
Committee, and the vote of the House thereon.”
Three additional representatives having thus been admitted into
the House, since the estimates referred to, were submitted by me,
the question arises whether the pay and milage of said additional
members, can be paid out of the appropriation made by Congress,
to meet the expenses of our Territorial government for the present
fiscal year. If you should be of opinion, that the provisions of the
Act of Congress, above referred to, have been violated by the Legisla-
tive Council, in increasing the number of representatives, will the
Department consider this a Sufficient cause, to refuse the payment of
the claims of the three new members, even if there should be enough
left, of the present appropriation, to pay those claims? But, sup-
posing the increase of representation does not conflict with the Acts
of Congress, and the appropriation is only sufficient to cover the pay
& mileage of the usual number of the Council, and their officers (to
wit, 15 Senator & 29 Representatives) I beg leave, respectfully, to ask
you whether their claims, under the Act of Congress of 29 Aug" 1842,"
would not be entitled to payment, to the exclusion of those of the three
additional members?
It has been usual for the Sec'y of the Territory, to give to each mem-
ber and officer of the Legislative Council, at the close of the Session,
a Certificate, under the Seal of the Territory, for the amount due him.
These certificates sanction the expenditures therein expressed, and
are issued, it is presumed, under the forms of legal authority. The
members & officers of the Council, therefore, find no difficulty in dis-
posing of them to third persons, upon whom falls the loss, should their

payment be refused at Washington. It seems clearly, therefore, to
be my duty not to issue any certificate, which I have not every reason
to believe, will be paid on presentation at the Treasury Department.
In asking your opinion, then, upon the queries above addressed
to you, and instructions thereon for my guidance, I am influenced,
solely, by a desire to do justice to all parties concerned—to the Govern-
ment, to the three new members, and to those who may, by assignment,
become the holders of their certificates, should they be issued by me.

TALLAHASSEE Jan'y 18" 1845
DEAR SIR, I sent you, a short time since, an Abstract shewing what
the deficiency in the present appropriation would be, should the
Council extend their Session to 75 days. Since then the House has
decided that the two new Counties of St Lucie & Marion are entitled to
representatives, and the members from those Counties have accord-
ingly been allowed to take their seats. The number of the House has
thus been increased by the addition of 3 new members, including the
one from Benton Co, since the estimates for the fiscal year ending
30" June 1845, were forwarded to Washington by me on the 13"
Sept 1843.” My own opinion is that the Legislative Council has no
right, under the Act of Congress of June 18" 1834 * to increase the
number of representatives. Such seems to have been their own con-
struction of the law until recently—For when the new Counties of
Santa Rosa and Wakulla, and allowed each one representative; the
representation of Leon and Escambia, out of which the former were
carved, was proportionally reduced. But however this may be, I do
not think the three new members can receive their pay and mileage out
of the present appropriation. The ordinary and usual number of the

Council (to wit 15 Senators and 29 representatives) for whom, doubt-
less, the present appropriation was made by Congress, will exhaust
the whole amount in a Session of about 48 or 50 days. Their right
to receive and use it, as far as it will go, will be held, I presume, by the
Department, as paramount to that of the new members.
I have, today, prepared and transmitted to the Register of the
Treasury Dep’t, an additional estimate covering the amount of the
pay and mileage of the 3 new members, for the present Session, which
I have requested him to lay before the proper Committee in Congress.”
I hope Congress will allow an addition to the Appropriation sufficient
to pay their claims.” If any thing can be done in the matter I know
it will receive your attention &c

[NA:GLO, Abandoned Mil. Reserv. File, Box 8:LS]
FORT BROOKE, Fa. January 21" 1845.
SIR, I have the honor to submit for the consideration of the general
in chief and Department of War, a proposition to reduce the limits of
the land directed by the President to be reserved for military purposes
around this Post, from Sixteen to four miles square.
The accompanying map shows the reservation,” as now established
marked A B and that proposed marked in like manner d e. It is
hardly probable any considerable portion of that proposed to be ex-
cluded, owing to its general sterility, will be for many years occupied,
except, on the Hillsboro river, outside the new line, for the purpose of a
County site when it is desirable to the convenience of the people that
a Court House &c be located. In that immediate neighborhood,
Commissioners duly appointed, have selected a quarter section, for
which it is understood application will be made to Congress: this
selection reaches on its Southern face to within the Garrison grounds
and if permitted will inevitably be productive of collisions and mutual
inconvenience—the reduced reservation will, it is believed, equally
serve the purpose and promote the convenience of the citizens.
Several enterprising settlers having established themselves within
the present limits, under the armed occupation (or donation act) in
good faith and in ignorance of the intrusion, it is hoped by the proposed
arrangement may be enabled to perfect their titles under the permits

granted at the land offices: while this modification will gratify the
citizens it can operate no material inconvenience or disadvantage to
the public service, except in the supply of fuel, and this exception is
merely contingent, so it is quite unlikely that any but a very trifling
garrison will be retained here after a few years, meanwhile, the im-
probability of extensive settlements hereabouts will admit of any
needful supply from unlocated lands, as at present, by the labor
of the troops.
Should the government assent to this proposition the convenience
of the community will be promoted by an early decision.

“The express mail between St. Augustine and Tampa Bay, gives
me so much trouble with the Post Office Department—being against

Copy H* Q” 9th Dept. S*AUGUSTINE Feby: 9. '45
GENERAL, The establishment of a civil mail across the Peninsula,
from Palatka to Tampa, has enable me to withdraw the military ex-
press heretofore indispensable—The necessity, in any contingency,
has ceased for the further occupation of Fort King, as a military
station—the detach" at that point has been accordingly withdrawn
except an individual to hold possession in behalf of the United States
until disposition shall be made, by proper authority, of the public
buildings.
I respectfully Suggest that the buildings temporarily assigned for
the use of the Federal Courts, be turned over to the Marshal without
condition or Consideration and that the remainder be Sold, after due
notice, to the highest bidder—It is not probably the whole, will bring
an amount equal to the expense & fees of Sale—Originally of slight
construction & unseasoned materials they are in ruinous condition &
rapid decay and yet will answer a momentary purpose for use of the
courts and afford comfort & encouragement to new settlers—
Should these suggestions be approved, it may be well to advise
the land officer in order that the lands appurtenant, may be included
in proximate Surveys, now being made, and opened for private entry
or public Sale.
I am General With high respect yr Obt Sev"

PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTIONS BY THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
[NA:HF, 28 Cong., 2 sess.:C]
[February 15, 1845]
Whereas by reference to the various Maps of Florida it is found
that the waters of Indian River and of the River St Johns are laid
down as approaching very near to each other, And Whereas this in-
formation is confirmed by the opinion of those who have travelled in
and are acquainted with that Section of Country, -And whereas it is
for these reasons confidently believed that a Canal Six or seven miles
in length might be made to connect the navigable waters of the two
said Rivers—And whereas the opening of such a Canal would be of
great importance to that section of Country through which those two
Rivers flow in as much as it would open an inland communication
with a vast extent of Country in Florida and the Cities of Savannah
and Charleston which it does not now possess, and would have a
tendency to increase very rapidly the population of the Southern
part of Florida and consequently add vastly to its importance and
prosperity, increasing at the same time the value of all the lands in
that Section of country—
Therefore be it resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council
of the Territory of Florida that our Delegate in Congress be and he
is hereby requested to use his best efforts to obtain an appropriation
from Congress for a Survey of that portion of country lying between
the head waters of Indian River and the River St Johns with a view
to the opening of a canal to connect the two Rivers—
Be it further Resolved that our Said Delegate be requested to urge
the appropriation by Congress of a Sum sufficient to defray the ex-
penses of a Survey between the head of Indian River and Cape Flor-
ida with a view to the ultimate connexion of Said Water courses by
Canals for the purpose of forming an Inland water communication to
Cape Florida—
And be it further Resolved that as soon as this Preamble and Res-
olutions shall have passed both houses and been approved by the
Governor a copy thereof duly authenticated by the proper officer be
forwarded to our Delegate in Congress.—
I certify the foregoing to be a true Copy of the Original Preamble
and Resolutions Adopted by the Legislative Council of Florida and

THE CHIEF ENGINEER TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:WD, CE Com. to SW and Cong., Bk. 5]
Engineer Department WASHINGTON February 18" 1845
HON W* WILKINS Secretary of War
SIR, I have the honor to state that I have this day received a Second
partial Report from the Board of Engineers sent to examine the Flor-
ida Reef and the dry Tortugas with reference to a system of defence.”
They have given this latter group a careful inspection and report
in favor of an immediate commencement of operations at one of the
Keys which they designate as the most important both for defence
and as a depot of Stores. The tenor of their Report, in full corrober-
ation of the Statements and opinions of the officer who preceded
them, and in coincidence with my own opinions derived from a study
of the best surveys extant, leaves no doubt in my mind of the pro-
priety of beginning at the position indicated, as soon as Congress
shall supply the means. The Simplicity of the site, and the ease with
which the indispensable conditions can be fulfilled, will permit the
plans for the fortification to be completed before they can in any
event be needed so that we may confidently assert that no other de-
lays will attend the commencement of them, than such as are involved
in the remoteness and isolation of the situation.
Should Congress deem the political condition of the Country to
demand a more vigorous prosecution of the florida reef defences than,
in the imperfect state of our knowledge, we could before venture
upon, I have, therefore to propose an additional grant of $150,000
for the fiscal year beginning July 1" 1845—to be applied to that
object.”

Engineer Department WASHINGTON Feby 181845
THE HONORABLE W" WILKINS Secretary of War
SIR/ It is desirable that measures be immediately taken to Secure
to the United States the title to the Site of the projected fort at Key
West, in order that no delay may occur in the application of the
funds now available for that purpose, after the exact position of the
fort shall have been fixed and the plans matured.—The Board of
Engineers now engaged on that duty, have not made their final re-
port, but sufficient information has been received to determine the
fact that the S. West Point of the Island must be occupied.—I have
therefore to request that the President of the U. States may be de-
sired to give the necessary instructions to the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, to cause to be reserved, for Military purposes, so much of the
S. Western portion of the Island and Shoals of Key West, as lie South
of the limits of the old “Town plat,” and West of a South Eastwardly
line, from the said limits of the town to the South Shore of the Island,
half a mile distant from the Light-house and parallel to the West
Shore.
The proposed reservation, therefore, will be bound, on the North,
by the limits of the old “Town plat” of Key West; on the West &
South, by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico; and on the East, by a
line commencing at a point on the South Shore, half a mile distant
from the Light-house, and running parallel to the general direction
of the West Shore of the Island to the limits of the said Town plat.
I enclose a Sketch of the West end of the island of Key West, with
the proposed reservation of the Island and Shoals marked thereon."—
The Surveys of the Gen'l Government have not yet reached this
island, and existing claims to a certain quantity of land which have
been confirmed by the Acts of Congress of the 24" of May 1828"
and 26* May 1830," have not yet been located.—It is not therefore
known whether all the land embraced in the proposed military reser-
vation belongs to the United States, but it is desirable to reserve the
whole, or as much of it as possible; and that the location of the claims
above recited should be made east of the reservation now asked.-
The Department is not able to indicate the course to be pursued to
Secure, within the Shortest time, possession of the land to the United
States,—if it be still possible to do so—but does not doubt that, in

knowledge of the great importance of the operations contemplated,
the best and most expeditious course will be pursued.—
In connexion with this Subject, I must draw your attention to the
Joint Resolution of Congress of Sept. 11" 1841,” forbidding the ex-
penditure of money upon sites until the title be secured to the United
States.—Should the sites above mentioned not be upon public land,
the Suspension of that Resolution as regards that position (and the
Tortugas Keys also, if they are covered by private claims) would
Seem to be indispensable to an early commencement of fortifications
on the Florida Reef.”—

[Referred February 26, 1845]
The undersigned inhabitants of West Florida, Memorialists, To the
Senate and house of Representatives in Congress assembled, do re-
spectfully herewith petition that honourable body in the following
prayer Viz. That having a full knowledge of the want of suitable
Quarters for the comfort and Convenience of the US troops stationed
for its defence in Pensacola harbour do Respectfully request proper
appropriations be made to erect such for a full Regiment the prob-
able number required to Garrison the three forts, at the site of Bar-
rancas the healthiest location in the neighbourhood of the Forts and
So Conveniently situated as to be within a few minutes run of Either
Forts Pickins or M"Ree. The Memorialists take upon themselves to
draw the attention of Your honourable body to this Subject through
Motives of humanity and Justice to the Soldiers who are stationed
here and on whose lives we trust the defence of our families and our
property. By Enquiring of the engineer & Quarter Masters depart-
ment, your body will ascertain there never has been provisions made
for Quarters for the Soldiers designed to Garrison the forts in Pensa-
cola Harbour. The consequence is they are now living in temporary
Sheds at Barrancas erected by their own labour hardly sufficient to
protect them from the storm and not from the inclemency of the
weather and that while in the neighbouring state of Louisiana and in
East Florida the soldiers have had erected Comfortable Barracks at
neither forts Pickins M*Ree or Barrancas has any provisions been
made for the Most important Station in the South and the Key of the
several Southern neighbouring States. besides the object in a national
point of view is important to the Government. Should accommoda-
tions be made at the healthy site of Barrancas for troops for instead
of having to incur anually the expence of hiring ground building Sheds
&c at Pass Christian for those stationed at New Orleans and Baton
Rouge and also at Indian Key for those stationed at Key West during
the Sickly Months They Could be Concentrated at Barrancas and
undergo in a large body the elementary exercise of drill &c so neces-
sary to decipline and in fact be made a school of practice for infantry
and Artillery and We ever pray. &c. &c

SIR, I beg leave to call your attention to some cases of mine now
in your office, of entries in the St. Augustine Land District, of Florida.
* House Journal, 28 Cong., 2 sess., p. 484. No specific appropriation appears
to have been made for quarters for the troops at Pensacola. But in the act
approved Mar. 3, 1845 (5 STAT. 746—747), there is an item of $170,000 for repair
and enlargement of barracks and for the erection of temporary cantonments at
such posts as may be occupied during the year.

They are entries made when John C. Cleland was Receiver, and, not
being regularly reported by him, patents have, in consequence, been
refused. To remedy this irregularity the act of June 15" 1844 was
passed.” But it is now contended that these cases are not within the
purview of this act, because the entries were of lands not subject to
private entry.
It is respectfully submitted, that as Mr. Cleland was the agent of the
Government, to sell these lands, and that individuals could not be
expected to know whether the lands they applied to enter had or had
not been offered at public sale, except upon information derived from
him, that the error could not be the fault of the purchasers. The
irregularity of these sales was designed to be remedied by the act of
1844, which was a virtual recognition of the acts of Cleland while
Receiver, extending that justice to the citizens for which they have
never looked to the Government in vain.
Being an act of liberality and justice, it is submitted that it should
be liberally construed, and that although the entries mentioned may
not come plainly & strictly within its letter, that they are clearly
covered by its spirit—It is therefore hoped that you will order the re-
lief contemplated by that law to be extended to these cases.

[Referred February 28, 1845]
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress Assembled.
Your petitioners, inhabitants of the City of S" Augustine Florida,
respectfully represent, that most of the youths of this ancient town
are growing up without education and that their parents in many
instances are too indigent to pay for their instruction. The govern-
ment of Spain made no provision for any School or College in East
Florida, and consequently many of our inhabitants are without that

education so indispensable to a free people. Without education,
neither our Constitution or laws will be understood or maintained.
The rights and liberties of our Citizens, though Secured by the great
Charter of our union, will serve but little purpose unless the principles
on which it is founded shall be firmly and clearly impressed on the
minds our rising generation. The protection and blessings we have
enjoyed under your patronage for more than twenty three years, has
taught us the value of liberty, and inspired us with devoted attach-
ment to the United States. The salubrity of S*Augustine is known
throughout the United States, and a Site more advantageous for the
establishment of a college, will not be found in all the South. The
catholic congregation, represent that their Church covers most of the
lot on which it Stands, and they have not ground Sufficient to erect
a college thereon. That the grants to private persons made by the
Spanish authorities, long Since, covers all the land in the vecinity of
S*Augustine, so that for many miles around, no School Sections could
be reserved, thus leaving the inhabitants of this City destitute of the
donation which Congress has so liberally provided for the inhabitants
of other Townships.
Your petitioners State that many of our citizens are decended from
Spanish ancestors who Settled in this City, while this province was
in possession of Great Britain and had been kept under the Military
Government of Spain until the transfer of Florida to the United
States. They have during that time enjoyed but few privileges of
improvement or education.
Your petitioners therefore pray that fifteen Sections of land may
be granted to the Catholic Congregation in this City to enable them
to erect a Suitable Institution of learning, and that a lot in the said
city known in the Plan and Survey of the Same, as the Custom
House lot, adjoining the lot on which the Catholic Church Stands,
may also be granted to said congregation, on which to found a col-
lege. Your petitioners state, that the Custom House was many
years since destroyed by fire and has ever since remained unocupied
and is now a heap of ruins. That the United States will never need
at this place a Custom house, and the said lot is in the middle of the
City and cannot be built upon while owned by the United States:—
its condition renders it a nuisance.
The Catholic Clergy at their own and the congregation's expense,
have now a common school and from their zeal and untiring energy
they have under tuition about seventy five boys, many of whom are
taught gratis and the others pay but a nominal Sum for the learning
they receive. With the aid Solicited of Congress your petitioners
entertain no doubt that the Catholic Congregation here will estab-
lish an institution that will do credit to our country. Youths from

ST. AUGUSTINE E. F. March 3rd. 1845.
COLONEL: I received your communication of the 31st January *
when on the point of leaving for the Haulover, the report called for
therein was made on the 1st Feby," but delayed in its departure near
two weeks owing to the failure of the mail.
I have lately returned from a re-examination of the Haulover, hav-
ing examined so much of the country in that vicinity as the recent sur-
veys of the deputy surveyors acting under instructions from the Gen-
eral Land Office rendered necessary. I have not found it expedient
to change the position of the canal intended to connect the waters of
Mosquito Lagoon and Indian River, being satisfied after careful ex-
amination of the localities with that view that the cut across the
Haulover at Fort Ann is the best position for the contemplated work.
It will be seen by consulting the printed map accompanying my pre-
vious report " that the direction of the cut is objectionable being al-
most perpendicular to the direction of the currents both of Indian
River and Mosquito Lagoons. This original location, faulty in it-
self, was made in consideration of its being the shortest line across
the narrow neck of land forming the Haulover, and it being contem-
plated to construct it by the troops with as little expense as possible.
This measure having failed, more care has been taken to give the canal
the best direction to guard against the formation of bars at either
mouth, and a different location made, increasing the distance to be
cut about 150 feet, which however will involve but slight additional
expense in its construction I see no reason to change the amount
estimated for in my letter of the 1st. February; by reports in the news-
papers of the action of Congress on the subject I find that $5000 has
been appropriated by the House for this purpose; this together with
the $1500 already appropriated will I think ensure the construction
of the canal—
Should the additional sum of $2500 asked for the completion of the
survey of Rail Road routes across the Territory be appropriated I
would beg that the earliest information may be given me in order that
I may complete the surveys before the warm and possibly wet season
should interrupt our work.
The aid of another officer of the Corps, who is not quite unexper-
ienced, if such an one is disposable would be of great assistance to me,
as I find no little difficulty in performing all the duties assigned me

SIR In reply to the letter from the Secretary of the Treasury of
the 3" inst:” reporting that the reservation of the S.W. portion of the
Island of Key West could not be made for Military purposes, I beg
leave to state, that as the Commissioner of the Genl Land Office re-
ports, that the whole Island is covered by claims which have been
confirmed; it would seem unnecessary to require the Survey proposed
by the Commissioner, unless the Survey of the Island is necessary to
reserve to the U States the Shoals which envelop the S.W point.—
It is very important that these Shoals at least should be reserved
and I have therefore to ask that the Secretary of the Treasury may be
requested to direct the reservation—
The limits of the Shoals desired are embraced between the water
line of the Shore of the S.W. Point of the Island (commencing at its
intersection with the Old Town plat, and extending South to the
Light House, Point, & thence East, half a mile from the Light House)
and the Channel."—

which has been suspended from the consideration that there was no
appropriation for private surveys—
The sum of ninety dollars & eight cents is also due to George Mackay
for the location of private claims under his contract of 12” February
1844–
And the further sum of one hundred & seventy one dollars is alike
due to Henry Washington for the survey & location of private claims
made under-contract bearing date 15* February 1844.
These several sums amounting in the whole to Three hundred &
twenty dollars & seventy cents—I respectfully request may be charged
to the appropriation of $5.000—made at the session of 1844–& which
was designed exclusively to pay for the survey & location of the private
claims in East Florida—& their connection with the public lands.
All these surveys have been received and approved by me & allowed
for at the former rate of $4. pr. mile.
I must again respectfully call your attention to my several communi-
cations upon the subject of the amount necessary to complete the pay-

SIR, The Legislative Council of this Territory, which commenced
its Session on the 6" January last, adjourned on the 11" inst, after
a Session of 65 days.
The Appropriation made by Congress for the pay and mileage
of the members of both Houses and pay of their officers, amounting
to $14,189.20,” was exhausted in fifty days. At the expiration of
that time, therefore, viz, on the 24th February last, I gave to each
member and Officer (exclusive of the members from the three new
Counties of Benton, St Lucie and Marion) an unqualified certificate
for the amount of pay and mileage then due. These certificates,
alone, are expected to be paid out of the present appropriation.
For the remaining part of the Session, viz, for the fifteen days
succeeding the 24" February last, I gave to each member and officer
a certificate, which will not be payable from the Treasury of the
United States, unless Congress should, hereafter, make an appropria-
tion therefor. These last mentioned certificates are all dated on
the 12th inst.84
Beleiving that the three members from the new Counties above
mentioned, could not properly be paid out of the appropriation
made by Congress for the pay and mileage of the members at the
present session, I gave them, also, conditional certificates, payable
whenever an appropriation was made therefor by Congress. I
herewith send you their receipts for the same.
Enclosed, you will also find a certified copy of the Compensation
Act passed by the Legislature on the 11" inst.” The amount appro-
priated by Congress (as you will see by reference to the Act) for
Contingent expenses of the Legislature, including printing, Stationery,
fuel and all other objects, is $7.675.”—The Amount appropriated

by the Act of our Legislature, for the same objects, including $300
for the distribution of the Laws, and the estimated amount of $400,
for printing the same, is $8.778.82—This, you will perceive, is ex-
clusive of the allowance due the ten regular and authorized officers
of the two Houses, whose services for 50 days must be paid out of
the Appropriation of $14,189.20.
The appropriation, then, by Act of the Legislature, for all con-
tingent objects, exceeds that made by Congress by about $1,103.82.
I have thought it proper, therefore, to refer all the parties holding
accounts, allowed in the Compensation Act of the Legislature, to the
Treasury Department, the accounting Officers of which are required by
law, to settle and adjust the same. All of those accounts will be for-
warded to the Department in a few days.
The pay roll, containing a list of the members and officers, with
receipts for their certificates; given unconditionally, for the first 50
days of the Session, as well as for those given conditionally for the
remaining 15 days, will be ready for transmission to you by the next
mail. At the request of M. L. Baker Esq. a merchant of this City,
I have this day forwarded to you, a package containing various
certificates, and an account for printing, all of which belong to him
I would merely remark that all of those certificates have been assigned
to him, and received by him, with a full knowledge on his part, that
they cannot be paid, without a further appropriation by Congress.
As before remarked, none of the Certificates given by me, were in-
tended or expected to be paid out of the present appropriation, except
those issued to the members and officers for their pay and mileage for
the first 50 days of the Session.

[NA:JD, Sol. Treas., Lets. on Debts and Suits, Bk. 23]
Office of the Solicitor of the Treasury March 19th 1845
SIR I have received the letter of the Hon. D. Levy of the 26th Feb-
ruary * inclosing one from Fran” Cummings to him dated January
31** proposing to purchase from the U. States lot N° 113 in the
City of Pensacola for the Sum of $1500, referred by you to this Of-
fice—And in regard to this proposition have the honor to report—
That it appears from the Correspondence of the District Attorney
of Florida with this office that tho the titles of the lot in question
was acquired from the Crown of Spain under the Treaty ceding the
Floridas to the U. States—The fact that the U. States owned this lot
was first Communicated to me by letter dated the 13" January
1843," in which he advised me that propositions had been made to
him to rent it, & requested instructions on that subject—.
By the Act of Congress establishing the office of Solicitor of the
Treasury, it is provided “that the Solicitor shall have charge of all”
lands and property which have been or shall be assigned set of and
conveyed to the United States in payment of debts, and of all tracts
created for the use of the U. States, in payment of debts, due thereon;
and to sell and dispose of lands assigned or set off to the U. States in
payment of debts &c”.—Under the provisions it was seriously doubted
whether this office was authorised to exercise any authority or con-
troul whatever over property acquired as this was—After further cor-
respondence with the District Attorney as to the situation, improve-
ments value &c of this & other lots in Pensacola acquired in the same
way I address him on the 23* September 1843," as follows It is matter
of some doubt if this Office was the power to take charge of the lots
at Pensacola which you enumerate in your letter of the 1" of August,

last "They belong to the U. States, and are not in charge of any offi-
cer of the Government so far as I am advised I have concluded “that
it would be best to instruct you to lease them for a term not exceed-
ing one year with a clause inserted in the leases, that they must be
surrendered if the U. States should require it within the year for any
purpose whatever”—Under these instructions, the lot in question was
rented by the District Attorney to Charles. C. Keyser one year for
$200–"he to keep the house & fences in repair for that period” this
he thinks is a fair rent, as the house & fences are all & much out of
repair”—
In regard to the value of the lot I have no knowledge except
what is derived from a report made to me on that subject by the
District Atty. on the 1" August 1843. in which he says “Lot known
in the plan of said City as lot No 113 containing 80 feet front on
Government Street by 190 feet depth on polafax Street with large
frame building thereon situated on the Corner of said lot, now occu-
pied by Charles C. Keyser—This was the old Spanish hospital.—It is
in the very center of the business part of the Town and is very
valuable”—
From the foregoing you will perceive that the law does not confer
upon me authority to sell this lot, and that I have felt myself at lib-
erty to take tempory charge of it; So far as to rent it & see that it is
taken care of—I have felt it my duty however to furnish all the infor-
mation which my office affords on the subject—It is stated in the
letters inclosed by Mr. Levy " that this house & lot, is not now
wanted for public purposes, and whether it ever will be necessary
for such purposes I have no means of knowing—As it appears to have
been set apart however for public purposes in the establishment of
the Town of Pensacola, by the Spanish authorities, and the U. States,
require much space for the accommodation of the Naval & Military
establishments at Pensacola, it occurs to me that it will prudent be-
fore deciding on the sale of the property to cause it to be examined
by the proper officers with a view to the future probable wants of
the Government for these purposes—
Should you determine that it is proper to sell the lot, I beg also to
suggest that the District Attorney be instructed to announce that
determination so as to invite competition—It is situated in a central
position in the business part of the town it is now occupied by M"
Keyser, who the District Atty. states is “a Merchant of Wealth &
respectability, and has occupied it for many years, but upon whose
permission or upon what terms he does not know”—He doubtless
would become a competitor for the lot, and I should doubt whether

offer of it, & that on a reasonable credit for a portion of the purchase

gard to the matters, and respectfully submit them for such action as
you may deem necessary & proper, I return the letter of Mr. Levy

GENERAL LAND OFFICE, MARCH 21* 1845.
SIR, Respecting the letters from the War Department referred
by you to this office on the 8" instant " I have the honor to state,
that on a previous application by that Department for the reserva-
tion of a part of the Island of Key West and the Shoals adjacent
to the South West point of it, I returned an answer on the 26" Ultimo,”
that the whole Island appeared to be covered by the grant of Estrada,
the Governor of East Florida, of 28." August 1815 to Juan P. Salas,
confirmed by the 1* Section of the Act of 23" May 1828° to the
extent of a league square (6002 50/100 Acres) in the names of John W.
Symington” and George Murray" claiming under Salas. The present
application for the reservation of these Shoals, is, I believe, without
precedent in this Office. There has been no survey of them, nor
indeed has there been any official survey of the Island, and the reser-
vations heretofore made have been based upon actual surveys,
which gave an identity and locality. The want of a survey, however,
in this case, is to a great extent supplied by the accompanying chart
marked A,” on which the boundaries of the proposed reservation are
colored yellow, and by which enough can be established to embrace
the wants and answer the purpose of the War Department. Doubts
were entertained whether this reservation of these shoals could be
ordered, in view of the rights of the riparian proprietors, but upon
investigation I have come to the conclusion that under the laws of

Spain no claim to these Shoals could be raised under the grant from
that Government to Salas, and that if beyond low water mark as
stated by the War Department, the reservation of them will not inter-
fere with the rights of the riparian proprietors.”
The case is respectfully submitted for your consideration, and
should you concur in this opinion, I have to request that you will
obtain from the President an order for the reservation of these Shoals,
and of Fleming's Key, a small Island north of Key West which is
also wanted by the War Department, and on the receipt of that
order the necessary instructions will be given to the Surveyor General
of Florida and the Land officers at St Augustine.—the proposed
reservations being within the limits of that Land District. The

What the effect of these laws are upon the Superior Court of this
district, and how far or to what extent its powers and jurisdiction are
suspended or annulled, or whether the Court or its jurisdiction is
actually abolished before or until the organization of the State Ju-
diciary and federal Courts, seem to be questions of some difficulty and
about which various opinions are entertained; and connected with or
growing out of these queries are one or two questions which are proper
to be decided by the Treasury Department, and which I will proceed
to explain—
The State Courts or tribunals cannot be organized until some time
in July or August, and in the mean time the Spring Terms of the
Superior Court should, according to the existing Laws, be held in five
or six different Counties in this District (as I suppose also in other
Districts) and the necessary orders made for transferring any remain-
ing causes, appropriately belonging to the State tribunals, to those
Courts—The Dist Court of the US, provided for by the Supple-
mentary Act will not, I am informed, be organized by the apptm" of
Judge, Marshal &c until sometime in June or July, and even when it
is organized I see no provision for the transfer of causes from the pres-
ent Superior Court to that Court—
Now one of the first questions which necessarily arises from this
State of things is, whether the Marshal will be furnished with the
necessary funds from the U.S. Treasury to defray the Expenses of
holding the Spring terms of the Courts, and whether the Salaries of
myself and other officers of the Court will be paid up to the time of
the organization of the new federal and State Judiciary—On this point
I should be glad to be informed immediately because if it is decided
by your Department that these Expenses and Salaries cannot be
paid, on the ground that the Court is abolished and the officers of
it defunct by operation of the Act, admitting the State of Florida, then
of course for the same reason it would seem to follow that we should
not continue to do any further official acts—
You will of course bear in mind that the present Superior Court
possesses the powers and judisdiction of a circuit & District Court of
the U.S. as well as a Territorial Court and there are now many causes
pending in it which belong exclusively to a federal Court and cannot go
to a State Court;—and many such causes in which the United States
are a party—If the court is considered as abolished by virtue of the
Act of admission then all this class of causes fall with it or are dis-
continued, and the injury to the Government would be very great—
it seems to me that this cannot be the case, but that the Court must
be considered as continuing in existence until expressly abrogated by
Law or until some provision is made for continuing or transferring
563214–62–66


## p. 1034 (#1050) ##########################################

1034 T E R R IT OR I. A L PA P E R S
this class of causes or business to the proper U.S. Courts—The powers
and jurisdiction of the Court as to Matters & causes properly belong-
ing to State Courts, may perhaps very properly be deemed to be
suspended by the act of admission, or annulled by implication, as
being incompatible with the Sovereignty of the State—but as to its
jurisdiction in other causes or matters properly belonging to an U.S.
Court, I see no reason why the same principle should apply, but on the
contrary that the Court should continue, till some act of Congress
expressly abolished the powers or until some provision was made for the
transfer of that class of business to the appropriate federal Courts.
So far as it respects Territorial business, or so far as it reflects that
class of causes or business which are properly cognizable by the State
Courts, ample provision is made for their continuance and transfer
to the appropriate State Courts (vide Sec" 2 & 4 of the Schedule &
ordinance appended to the Florida Constitution which may be found
in the 4" Vol. of the Ex: Documents of the 3"Sess: of 25" Congress—
Ho: Doc: No. 208–page 20. & 21.) but that ordinance of the State
authorities cannot I apprehend confer any authority on me as an U.S.
Officer, or authorise me to do any act appertaining to the Duties of
an U.S. Judge
Congress certainly could not have intended that there should be
a kind of interregnum of three or four months, and it is manifest that
the public interest would be best promoted by the present Courts
and authorities continuing to act until regularly Superseded and the
business can properly be transferred to other Courts—And though
I am reluctant on the one hand to exercise any power or authority
which may be doubtful or questionable—Yet on the other hand I
should be equally unwilling to avoid or shun any proper responsibility
which may rest upon me in consequence of this conjunction of circum-
stances or lack of clear legal provision—nor should I regard the ques-
tion whether my salary was or was not paid, as of controuling influence,
but only as tending to give me your construction of the late acts of
Congress and thus aiding me in determining what course I ought to
pursue, or how I should construe them
As the Courts, if they are held at all, must commence on the 4"
Monday of April I beg the favor of an early reply"—

SIR—Florida having been, “admitted into the Union on an equal
footing with the original States, in all respects whatsoever,” on the
3" Instant; it has become a Serious question here; whether the powers
of our Superior Courts; (which were established & derived their
authority from the acts of Congress entitled “an act for the establish-
ment of a Territorial government in Florida” approved March 30"
1822" 3"Storys Laws p. 1828." The act to amend said act “ap-
proved March 3" 1823”3"Storys Laws p 1902 and the act to amend
the several acts for the establishment of a Territorial Government
in Florida approved May 15" 1826." Ibid 2033) have ceased to exist.
An act was also passed on the 3" Instant" providing for a District
Court with Circuit Court powers for the district of Florida; but
that court is not yet organised, & if it were, the act contains no pro-
vision for the removal of causes from the Superior Courts into it:
the impression of my mind at first I must confess was, that as those
courts were established by Congress under the clause of the Con-
stitution which impowers it, to make all needful rules & regulations
respecting the Territory or other property belonging to the United
States; or under the power resulting from the right of the United
States to govern a Territory which it had rightfully acquired, &
not under the provisions of the first Section of the third article of the
Constitution which does not apply to them (opinion of the Hon.
William Wirt attorney general; opinion of Attorney General of the
United States p. 378, opinion of the Hon Felix Grundy attorney
General Ibid pages 1236 & 1237, and the case of the American In-
surance Company et al. vs Canter & others 1 Peters Rep. 541 to 546.”
All their powers ceased “Co, instanti” with the approval of the act
of admission (or at least so soon thereafter as the act was promulgated)

except so far as those powers may have been continued by the Con-
stitution of the State; which it was believed could only give them
authority so far as regarded suits that might be instituted in, or such
business as might be done by Judges of, the State Courts but the
Judge of our Superior Court (the Hon Isaac H Bronson) for whose
legal opinions I have a high respect, is inclined to a different opinion,"
& although he has not yet fully decided the question, he has intimated
an opinion, that so far as the Court possesses or exercises the powers
of a United States Court, & in causes & matters properly & soley
cognizable in a federal Court, the powers of our Superior Courts
are not revoked or annulled; if it is so (he says) the operation upon
the causes & interests of the United States will be most disastrous
If these tribunals are dead & defunct then of course (he supposes
that) all suits & causes pending in them are discontinued & at an
end also; unless there is some special provision of law, by which they
are continued & (can be) transferred to other and appropriate tri-
bunals, perhaps he is right in the view he takes of the present powers
of these Courts: it were well that they possessed the power to go on
with the public business; Such a State of things as he depicts, is
certainly to be deprecated, As regards the State government, the
Convention which formed & adopted the constitution of the State;
has by a schedule & ordinances therein declared “In order that no
inconvenience might arise from the organization & establishment
of the State government that all officers civil & military now (the
11" day of January 1839 the date of the Constitution) holding their
offices & appointments in the Territory under the authority of the
United States, or under the authority of the Territory shall con-
tinue to hold & exercise their respective Offices & appointments
until Superceded under the Constitution” Had Florida been ad-
mitted into the Union immediately after the adoption of the Con-
stitution this schedule & ordinance would probably have answered
the purpose for which it was intended, without any question having
been raised upon it; but during the time which has elapsed since the
adoption of that instrument by the convention; most of the persons
then holding offices in the Territory of Florida have departed this
life; or been superceded by others. It is perfectly clear that the
convention did not intend that any interregnum should take place,
and it is also quite evident that it did not contemplate that so much
(or any considerable) time would elapse before the admission of
Florida into the Union. Can we in this state of the case say, that
the word now in the schedule & ordinance applies to the time of ad-
mission & not to the date of the Constitution? If not, can we reject

it altogether? In a word can persons not then holding office, but
who have since that time been elected or appointed to offices in the
Territory of Florida, either under the authority of the Territory or the
United States in accordance with the most liberal rules for the con-
struction of Statute which can be applied to that schedule & ordi-
nance now find in it authority to “hold & exercise their respective
offices?” If they can, I am not sure that it will relieve us entirely
(if at all) from the difficulty, as respects the business of the United
States. I am aware that there are strong authorities to sustain the
position that “Whenever the intention which the makers of a statute
entertained can be discovered, it ought to be followed in its construc-
tion in a course consonant to reason & discretion although such con-
struction seems contrary to the letter of the Statute: especially T. C.

also true that where great inconvenience will result from a particular

at Gaines' pen, to this place. On this route I saw and conversed
with nearly all of the few inhabitants settled directly on the road,
and many others, as most of them had business with me, and they
all, expressed their full confidence in the pacific disposition of the
Indians and that the inhabitants are, and will be, entirely safe from
any molestation if they will let them alone and not go among them:
But that any attempt to remove the Indians by force, will invole
the country in a repetition of all the dangers and sufferings of the
late war.
So far as I could learn no Indians have been seen on any of these
roads since last October or November, when three men, hunting,
came to a house, or near it, nine miles south of fort Dade, but did
nothing to molest the family by hostile manner, or the slightest
theft. The woman of that place has since become a widow, but
still prefers remaining there, with half a dozen small children and
considerable property in stock (cattle) rather than return to her
friends and relations in the older settlements. Yet many of the
more distant settlers are not pleased that the Indians are permitted
to remain in Florida, and profess to apprehend iminent dangers.
Many families from the northern part of the Territory, some of
them very respectable, have removed down the peninsula, and
others contemplate doing so: Not satisfied with what they can
find out of the Ever Glades, some, no doubt, will be disposed, for
no commendable object, to establish themselves in or contiguous
to the Indian district: already such an attempt has been made south
of Tampa Bay. If they are allowed to fix themselves on the Indian
line, the apprehended dangers and war will soon be realized. To
guard against this I think the United States government should
preserve a neutral border, of twenty five miles in width, between
the white people and Indians, across, or into, which no white man
or Indian should pass except at stipulated places, with permits.
This will occasion but very little, if any, loss to the national wealth,
or State population, for that part of the country is so unsuitable
for the abode of industrious, honest, white people that it is not likely
the whole border would sell for twenty five thousand dollars, or
support one hundred families
I have deemed it proper, General, to communicate this information
to you, and you may keep the letter as a public one, or throw it in
the fire at your pleasure.”

Ins. Gen. Respecting Indians in Florida, That part of the country
adjoining the boundary line of the district assigned to the few Semi-
nole Indians still in Florida, is believed to be, in general, poor “pine
barren” and would not, to any extent, be occupied by agriculturists,
and any other class of settlers it is of great importance to keep from
the immediate vicinity of the Indians. This can be effected, perhaps,
by adopting the excellent suggestion of Colonel Churchill, Inspector
General, the writer of this letter, by setting apart a neutral border
of twenty five miles in breadth. It is understood that the Commis-
sioner of the General Land Office is desirous of acertaining the bound-
ary line of the present Indian district, with the view of terminating
his surveys there at; and I would recommend, as one means of effecting
the object proposed by Colonel Churchill, that the Commissioner
be instructed to let none of his lines approach the Indian boundary
nearer than twenty-five miles. Respectfully submitted to the Sec.

GENERAL LAND OFFICE April 8" 1845
V. Y. CONWAY Es Sur Gen St Augustine Florida
SIR, Yours of the 17* February has been received," enclosing
one plat of Township boundaries and five Township plats, being the
entire resurvey of A. Worrall Esq. on the Withlacoochee River. I
am surprised that you should have approved this work, and sent up
the account for it to this Office for payment, when from the diagram
returned by you, the surveys by M. Weightman in Townships 15.
16. 17. 18.19 & 20 of Range 19. Township 14 of Range 20, and Town-
ship 20 of Range 18 overlap the surveys by Clements, resurveyed by
Worrall, from one to one and a half miles on the parallels and a half
mile on the meridians. But this surprise is immeasurably increased
when by referrence to the plats of these townships transmitted by
you on the 30th Aug, 1843 * & 13" May 1844." the two surveys
are represented as harmonizing perfectly, the lengths and bearings
of the lines and connections all given, and the work appearing as
perfect as could could be desired, and all examined and approved by
you. These things have a tendency to destroy the confidence of the
Office in the correctness of your returns and to produce such doubt
of your Official acts as to delay the public business. It is hoped
however that a similar exhibition of carelessness, to say the least of
it, will not again occur. I have suspended M. Worrall's compensa-
tion for the work done by him in these Townships until this Office
is satisfied that he correctly retraced the lines heretofore surveyed
by Clements, when thus satisfied the amount suspended will be imme-
diately remitted to him. For the balance of his account a requisi-
tion was submitted on the 3" inst, to the Secretary of the Treasury,
with a request that it be remitted as directed. You will immediately
recall all the Township plats in which these errors exist, which have
been sent to the land Offices, and appoint one of your most experi-
enced Deputies, in whose skill and integrity you have implicit con-
fidence to correct these surveys. On the presumption that the
Diagram returned by you on the 17" of February last correctly
depicts the state of these surveys, you will instruct the Deputy to
cancel all the marks of every description made by Clements which
interfere with Weightman's work in Townships 15. 16. 17. 18 & 19
of Range 19, to retrace all the lines originally run by Clements in
these Townships, which are not interfered with by Weightman's work

and to close the work in those Townships and establish new town-
ship and section corners upon Weightman's exterior meridians and
parallels, in such manner that the new corners shall be distinguished
from those established by Weightman. The sections will retain the
numbers which they now have in the field as shewn by the accom-
panying diagram.” This tier of Townships cannot now be made
perfect without an immense cost to the Government and as the land
is reported as not being valuable it is deemed proper to make the
corrections at the least possible cost and hence this patch work,
which is disgraceful to the service, must now be adopted, the ne-
cessity for which should never have existed, and would not, had proper
care and attention been given to the business. So much of the lines
run by Weightman in Townships 20 of Ranges 18 & 19, as interferes
with the lines formerly surveyed by M Clements in Townships 19 of
Ranges 17 & 18 will also be cancelled and the necessary connections
given to calculate the areas of the fractional sections thus caused
upon the entire Northern boundary of T. 20. R 18. and in part upon
the Northern boundary of T. 20 R 19.
On the accompanying diagram the surveys are represented as re-
ported by you and if your report is correct, the dotted lines on that
diagram are those which must be obliterated in the field as above
directed, and the numbers of the sections those which must remain
upon the field, you should furnish the Deputy with a Copy of this
diagram, and instruct him, first to ascertain whether it is correct and
if so to obliterate the dotted lines in such a manner, that they will
not mislead or produce confusion, and to number the sections as there-
on indicated. The offsets on the old basis parallel between Town-
ships 14 & 15, shewn upon the diagram transmitted by you, have
induced the idea that the survey by Mr Weightman of T.14. Range
20 overlaps the old surveys in Townships 13 & 14 of Ranges 19 &
20, but as these interferences are not shewn upon the Diagram re-
turned by you, specific instructions in relation to these Townships
cannot be given. The Deputy should first examine those interfer-
ences and also the work done by M Prevost, which I fear is in like
condition and make immediate report of the whole matter to you,
that instructions may be sent to him before he leaves the field. If
you have remaining sufficient of the fund for completing unfinished
surveys at five dollars per mile you may pay for the lines actually
run and marked under these instructions at that rate, which will com-
pensate the Deputy for his services in obliterating the erroneous and
interfering work, and if you have funds for that object you can also
contract with the Deputy for the resurvey at $4 per mile of such
other portions of the work contiguous to the contracts of Mess"

Wightman & Prevost as will create an inducement to him to take the
contract.
From the evident and total disregard of instructions manifested in
the location of permits No" 89–139–796 & 508 in T 19 S. of R 17 E,
it would seem to be useless for this office to send you instructions.
The location of these permits is a subject which has been so fully
discussed and the principle—that they must be located in accordance
with legal subdivisions—has been so distinctly inculcated, that it
was thought there could be, with relation to it, no misunderstanding.
If you will refer to the surveying laws and instructions you will per-
ceive that there is no authority to lay down the West boundaries of
permits 89 & 139, or the south boundary of 508, or the North bound-
ary of 796, in the manner indicated on the plat. If these boundaries
have been run on the field, Mr Worrall must correct them before full
payment can be made for his work, and if only laid down on the plat
they must be corrected, and the plat is herewith returned for that
purpose. It is hoped that a similar subdivision will not again be
made, and to prevent a recurrence of such errors, I refer you partic-
ularly to the act of 11" Feby, 1805" the provisions of which are so
plain that they cannot be misunderstood.
You will please prosecute this matter with all vigour, as M' Wor-
rall's account for these interfering surveys will remain suspended till
the necessary examinations are had, and if, on examination, the error
is found to be in the retracing of Clements work you will report the
facts immediately to this office, that other and further instructions
may be given.”

grows out of the recent change in the relation in which Florida stands
to the General Government.
The question is, whether the United States district Courts in Florida
as organized under the Territoral Government have at this time, juris-
diction of prosecutions and suits in which the United States is a party
and will continue to have such jurisdiction until they are superseded
by the organization of the “district of Florida” as provided for in “the
act supplimental to an act for the admission of the States of Florida
and Iowa into the Union and for other purposes” approved March
3rd 1845.52
The terms used in the 3" section of that act are prospective—
“that the said State shall compose one district&c” and the constitution
of the State of Florida provides in the 1" section of the 17" Article as
follows: “all laws and parts of laws now in force or which may be
hereafter passed by the Governor & legislative council of the Terri-
tory of Florida, not repugnant to the provisions of this constitution,
shall continue in force until by operation of their provisions or limita-
tions, the same shall cease to be in force; or until the General Assembly
of this State shall alter or repeal the same” and in the fourth section
of the same article as follows: “all officers civil and military now hold-
ing their offices and appointments in the Territory under the authority
of the United States, or under the authority of the Territory shall
continue to hold and exercise their respective offices & appointments
until superseded under this constitution”—
The first legislature of the State of Florida will convene on the 4"
Monday in June and before that time, occurs the regular period for
holding the Spring term of the Courts in this district—You will find
from my previous correspondence with your office that prosecutions
and suits against Trespassers upon the public lands in this district
are either pending or ready to be preferred and instituted to a very
large extent” and it is important that I should have the best advice
as to the propriety of proceeding with them at the approaching term
in case the “district of Florida” is not organized by the appointment of
a Judge prior to the term.
There is one consideration which renders it greatly desirable to
avoid delay if it can be done, and but for that consideration I myself
would counsel delay so as to avoid all doubts upon the subject of
jurisdiction—The prosecutions to which I have alluded are founded
upon the act of the 2" March 1831* in relation to the cutting of
* 5 STAT. 788. See supplementary act approved Feb. 22, 1847 (9 STAT. 128–
131), regarding the transfer of certain classes of cases to the U.S. District Court
for Florida. See also act creating an additional U.S. District Court for Southern
Florida, approved Feb. 23, 1847 (9 STAT. 131–132).

timber upon public lands—the cases are numerous and important for
the depredations have been very extensive and very great—but the
act of limitation of April 30" 1790"Sec 31 which restricts the penalties
of all such acts as that of 1831 to offences committed within the last
two years has already exempted many of the trespassers from pros-
ecution and the lapse of every additional month is depriving the
United States of the protective benefit of this act. It is now nearly
twelve months since Lieut: Farrand of the Navy received orders to
attend to this subject (& this first put the Trespassers on their guard)
and if no bills can be preferred till the first court of the district of
Florida is held at Tallahassee in January next as is provided by law, it
is obvious that nearly all the offenders previous to L'Farrands arrival
here will be protected form prosecution by the act of limitation.
These considerations make it desirable that the bills should be pre-
ferred at once if it can be done, but of course, if our existing Courts
have no jurisdiction, it is best that no abortive attempt should be
made to enforce the law.
With regard to the civil suits which have been and are to be in-
stituted in behalf of the United States, I do not apprehend that any
loss or inconvenience would ensue if delay should be thought ex-
pedient or necessary.

By the 1* section of the Act of March 3" 1845" it is enacted,
“That the States of Iowa and Florida be and the same are hereby
declared to be States of the United States of America, and are hereby
admitted into the Union on equal footing with the original States
in all respects whatsoever.” The Judicial system established by the
laws of the United States for the Territory of Florida, was in full force
at the time of the passage of this Act. When she becomes a State
of the Union, and at what time the jurisdiction of these Courts shall
terminate,—whether on the passage of the Act, or when her organi-
zation shall have been completed by her own State authorities,
acting under her State Constitution, as to all subjects within the
control of her Legislature, and as to others by the complete organiza-
tion of the Federal Courts, authorized by the Act supplemental to
the Act before referred to, are questions of much interest. They
are however questions for the Judiciary itself, and must be settled
by the Court. I will only remark, that it cannot be presumed to
have been the intention of Congress to have produced an abeyance
of all Government in Florida, from the passage of the Act of admission
to the organization of a new order of things,—that there was to be
no Government, Executive or Judicial, and no laws except the funda-
mental law established by their Constitution. On general principles,
I am clear in the opinion, that this is not the result, and such has
been the practice it is believed in at least ten of the thirteen new
States heretofore admitted into the Union. I therefore entirely
approve the course indicated by the Solicitor of the Treasury, of
instructing the District Attorneys to proceed with the business of
the United States in the existing Courts. But as I have before
remarked, this is a question of Judicial authority on which my official
opinion would have no controlling influence with those on whom
its decision devolves.
The only question involving Executive authority and action is:
Have you now, in the recess of the Senate, the power to appoint the
District Judge, the District Attorney, and the Marshal, whose offices
were created by the Act entitled “An act supplemental to the Act
for the admission of the States of Iowa and Florida into the Union,”
approved March 3" 1845?” The question has often occurred, and
the interpretation of the Constitution has been so well established,
that I cannot doubt on it. If vacancies are known to exist during
the session of the Senate, and nominations are not then made, they
cannot be filled by Executive appointments in the recess of the
Senate. And the rule is the same, where offices are created by law,

information necessary to the District Attorney to enable him to

the investigation as will lead to the conviction of the guilty. I have
delayed answering your letter until this moment in order to obtain

presented on that day for payment, by James Hall & Co. of New

having been previously notified by Hon. Mr Hamlin, of Maine, of

[NA:JD, Sol. Treas., Lets. on Debts and Suits, Bk. 24]
Office of the Solicitor of the Treasury April 30" 1845.
SIR Yours of the 29" Ultimo,” in relation to the effect of the act
admitting Florida into the Union, upon pending suits, prosecutions
and processes in the Superior Courts of the Territory in which the
United States are interested, and asking instructions from this Office,
relative thereto,-has been received.
You say: “Florida having been admitted into the Union on an equal
footing with the original States, in all respect whatever, on the 3"
instant, -it has been a serious question here whether the powers of
our Superior Courts, which were established, and derived authority
from the acts of Congress entitled “An act for the establishment of a
Territorial Government in Florida, approved March 30" 1822” "—
The act to amend said act, approved March 3" 1823."—and the act
to amend the several acts for the establishment of a Territorial
Government in Florida, approved May 15" 1826." have ceased to
exist. An act was also passed on the 3" instant, providing for a
District Court, with Circuit Court powers, for the District of Flor-
ida,—but that Court is not yet organized,—and, if it were, the act
contains no provisions for the removal of causes from the Superior
Courts into it.”
Since the 4" of March 1789.—when the Constitution of the United
States went into effect, there have been thirteen new states, which
have established their constitutions and been admitted into the
Union, under as many separate acts of Congress. Provisions were
made in but three of these acts of Congress, to wit, in those admitting
the States of Maine, Missouri,” and Alabama,” into the Union for
the transfer of the pending suits, prosecutions, and processes, into the
new Courts established by the several acts of admission.—There may
have been no occasion for such provisions in the acts admitting Ver-

mont, Kentucky, Tennessee,” and Maine, as those states were sever-
ally formed out of Territories within the jurisdiction of four of the
original and existing states, and the Federal Court system had already
been extended over them, and would remain thither, -and in all its
force and effect, unless, and until changes were introduced by other
laws. But it was otherwise with regard to the States of Ohio," Lou-
isiana," Indiana," Mississippi,” Illinois "Arkansas,” and Michigan.”
They were all formed out of Territory belonging to the United
States;—and it would have been interesting to know what became of
the pending suits, prosecutions, and processes in their several Terri-
torial Courts, at and after the time those States respectively were
admitted into the Union—The Book of Reports, which I have had an
opportunity to consult, have furnished me with no information upon
the subject. Whether the suits were permitted to abate, and were
commenced de novo, or whether they were transferred de facto to
the new Courts and “had day” therein, according as they pertained
to the State or Federal tribunals, I am unadvised. Whatever may have
been the course taken in regard to them, it would seem to have been
generally acquiesed in, for my scrutinies have brought me upon no
adjudication which attests that any questions were raised about
them, which brought to judgement the matters of right or jurisdic-
tion involved. I had hoped to have derived some accurate and use-
ful information, from the files and records of this Office, so far as the
States of Arkansas and Michigan were concerned, inasmuch as this
Office was established prior to the admission of either of them. They
furnish, however, nothing very precise or positive, -but it may be
regarded as a negative, pregnant with some importance, that they
make known no embarrassments affecting pending suits, prosecutions,
or processes, which attended the changes of those Governments.
Such a circumstance would seem to authorize strong inferences, at
least, that they were either regularly tried and disposed of in the
courts where they were commenced, or being transferred de facto to
the appropriate new tribunals, were without available opposition,
tried or disposed of there. In the absence of all counterproofs it
would perhaps be allowable to carry the inferences further, and de-
duce like results as attending pending suits, prosecutions and proc-

esses, in Ohio, Louisiana, Indiana, and Illinois, after those states
respectively were admitted into the Union; and a long, unbroken
usage like this, in the silence of the laws, might reasonably be applied
to Florida in a like conjuncture.
The power to transfer causes from Superior Courts to the new Dis-
trict Court, in the absence of any express authority to do so, after
the District Court has been organized and put in operation, is a ques-
tion of much interest, undoubtedly, and as an original one, would not
be free from difficulty and must have been upon us, for judgement
and action, had the offices pertaining to the new Court been filled
during the Session of the Senate. We are happily disembarrassed of
that question at this time, as the President has wisely determined
that he cannot make those appointments “during the recess of the
Senate.” A just interpretation of the clause in the Constitution
which confers the power to fill all vacancies, makes it plain that he
is without the power to do so. It provides that—
“The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may
happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions
which shall expire at the end of the next Session”.
The word “vacancies” in all proper parlance, and ex vi termini must
apply, and can apply, to such offices only, as have been actually
vacated by death, removal, resignation, or promotion;—and surely
cannot and do not apply to offices which never were filled, and which
could not, for that reason, have been vacated. But were I even
mistaken in this, and the expression should receive a larger interpre-
tation, it would by no means remove the obstacles which exist to
making the appointments at this time; for if the offices of Judge,
District Attorney, and Marshal, created by the act of 3" March
1845,” are to be regarded as “vacancies,” then they must have been
such, at and from the moment the offices were created—that is to say,
while Congress was in Session, and not “during the recess of the
Senate”; and, it might be added, that the word “happen” would seem
inappropriate applied to any “vacancies” other than those where the
changes had been wrought through power, will, or casualty.
On the receipt of your letter, I addressed a communication to the
President,” suggesting these views against the power of making the
appointments at this time; and he, having referred it to the Attorney
General, received a reply concurring in my views, which, having ap-
proved, he transmitted to this office.* Copies of each of these com-
munications, I transmit you herewith.”

The real and the only question requiring consideration now, is; At
what time does the act, admitting Florida into the Union, put an end
to the functions of the Superior Courts established in that Territory
by Congress?
Before responding to this question, it is proper that I should notice
and dispose of some suggestions, to which your letter has called my
attention, in regard to the effect and operation of the 4* Section of
the XVIIth: article of the Constitution of Florida, upon the Terri-
torial Courts, and the suits, prosecutions, and processes pending
therein. That Section is as follows:
“All officers, Civil and Military, now holding their offices and ap-
pointments in the Territory, under the authority of the of the United
States, or under the authority of the Territory, shall continue to hold
and exercise their respective offices and appointments, until super-
seded under this Constitution, and all actions at law, or suits in
Chancery, or any proceeding pending in any Court of the Territory
of Florida, may be commenced in, or transferred to, such Court of the
State as may have jurisdiction of the subject matter thereof.”
Strongly as my convictions might incline me to the conclusion,
that, in regard to pending suits, prosecutions, and processes, appro-
priate to the adjudications of the State tribunals, the above provision
of the Constitution of Florida fully meets the difficulty and provides
for it, and that the terms, “now holding their Offices and appoint-
ments,” under a just interpretation, and with the help and guidance
of pertinent analogies, refer and pertain to the functionaries who hold
them, without regard to any changes of the individuals who may be
the functionaries; yet, having no rightful jurisdiction in the premises,
I do not deem it proper to give my opinion upon the subject.
Whether, however, the fourth section referred to can have any effect
upon the duration of “offices and appointments”, made “under the
authority of the United States,” which do not obstruct, and which
may (at the option of Congress) survive the organization and estab-
lishment of the State Government, is quite another question; and still
another question would be, how far “actions at Law, or suits in Chan-
cery”, pertinent and appropriate to the adjudications of the Courts
of the United States, abate with or survive such organization and
establishment of the State Constitution. Can the fourth section
of the article referred to preserve such Offices, or entitle such causes,
to “keep day” in Court? Neither: nor for a moment, in my opinion.
Can it then abridge the duration of such offices, or abate and put an
end to such causes? It is equally impotent, in my opinion, to do
either.


## p. 1055 (#1071) ##########################################

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 1055
The Executive nor legislative powers, constituted and established
by Congress in the Territory of Florida, nor the functionaries admin-
istering either, can survive the change of Government when it shall be
effected, because the effect of the admission into the Union is to vest
those powers in offices created by the substituted State Government,
and they are to be administered of course by functionaries of its own
appointment.—The Executive and Legislative jurisdictions will thus
have passed away, and the offices, therefore, which were constituted
but to give them practical efficacy could not, by any means, or for
any time, survive the disruption. But it most concerns us to know
whether, if at all, the fourth section affects the duration of the judicial
power vested in the Territorial Courts which were created by Congress,
or under its authority? If the power, or any part of it, survives, it
confers, and has, and keeps jurisdiction, and in the absence of a pro-
hibition mere implication would be enough to save the Courts which
would be essential to the exercise of that jurisdiction until their func-
tions were supplied by substituted judicatures. But the question we
have first to do with is, what effect, if any, the fourth section will have
upon the judicial power vested by Congress, and in the Courts which
Congress constituted; or upon the jurisdiction which it gave to such
Courts; or upon the Officers appointed by the President and Senate,
who minister therein. After due consideration, I am not prepared
to attribute any effect in the premises to the clause referred to in the Con-
stitution of Florida. I ascribe the whole, such as it is, and be it what
it may, to the act of Congress admitting Florida into the Union. How
far that act may be deemed to affect those questions will be hereinafter
considered.
It may be said, that inasmuch as the Constitution of Florida has
received the sanction of Congress, its provisions have derived there-
from all the weight and authority rightly due to the act of Congress
itself which attested that sanction by receiving her into the Union,
imparting to, and accepting from her sovereign powers, and thereby
giving to those provisions activity and force and putting them in op-
eration. Certainly, it is fair to infer, and I agree in the main, that
whatever passes Congress, receives its approval, and has the impress
of its authority, but then these inferences have their limitations and
restraints, and can only be true and allowable in those cases where
Congress has the right to examine, and the jurisdiction to decide,
and the power to reject, the several and particular provisions which
the instrument passed upon by Congress may contain. Does Con-
gress possess so large a jurisdiction in the premises that it may exercise
supervisory powers and discretion over state constitutions submitted
to its approval without limitation, and therefore without control?
I have not so read the constitution and cannot think so.

On the application of Territories to be admitted into the Union
as States Congress may, indeed, admit them, or refuse to admit them,
but can it impose any binding conditions of admission which are
incompatible with that precise and indispensable equality among
the States, in reference both to the Sovereignty parted with, and the
Sovereignity reserved, which the constitution at once allows and
requires—establishes and secures? There is no one practical equality,
more precious or prized, than the exclusiveness of the power, inherent
in every new state, to determine for itself, without the “let or hind-
rance” of Congress, what provisions its own Constitution shall contain,
just as every other state which has entered into the Union has decided
that question aforetime for itself. Congress if, indeed, to take care
that each State provides itself with a “Republican form of Govern-
ment,” for none other could be adopted to abide the restraints, or
realize the privileges which the Constitution imposes in the one case,
and confers in the other. Beyond this, and its general acquiescence in
the usual and essential results, of substituting State for Territorial
forms of Government, nothing, in my opinion, is to be inferred from
the admission or rejection of a State, of the assent or dissent of Con-
gress, either to the whole or to any of the particular provisions con-
tained in its Constitution which can be regarded as in any wise con-
clusive or even as authoritative. If future scrutinies shall make
manifest a repugnance of any of them to the Constitution, laws, or
Treaties of the Union, it would be past all the powers of Congress to
protect, and hence nothing in the act of admission could save them
from the penalties of nullity and aviodance, which the Constitution
itself denounced and inflicts. On the other hand, those provisions
which are free from such repugnance and obnoxious to no objections,
derive and have, all their force and virture from the conventions
which established the State Constitutions, and the people who accepted
them, and none whatever from the imputed but impassive sanctions
of Congress in admitting into the Uuion the States which made them.
If this were otherwise what else could follow, but that amendments,
made in state constitutions after the states were admitted into the
Union, being without the sanction of Congress, would be held as
less authoritative, and therefore of slighter obligation, than the
provisions contained in them at the time they were admitted? Such
discriminations would soon originate the principle and arouse the
incentive, and those influences being brought to bear, would shortly
thereafter, introduce the practice of submitting all such amendments
and the state constitutions themselves, to the revision and action
of Congress. This would effect a practical revolution of the Govern-
ment—concentrate all sovereignty in centralism—and all that identity
and distinctiveness which these states preserve in Federation,

together with all the inherent Supremacy of each in the powers they
reserved out of the grants to which they made, would disappear and
be lost in the sameness and oneness which would result, from this
centralizing jurisdiction over the municipal Sovereignty of the States.
Hence, I do not think we can derive any aid in our examination from
the saving provisions contained in the fourth Section of the XVIIth:
article of the Constitution of Florida and consequently that if the
pending suits and processes in the Superior Courts of Florida are
to be saved from abatement, and “keep day” therein until the Dis-
trict Court has been organized and put in operation, we must go
in quest of authority elsewhere, and more adequate to the purpose
in view.
The three acts of Congress cited in the paragraph of your letter,
which I have quoted, informs us of the Courts in which the judicial
power, existing in the Territory of Florida, was vested, and of the
jurisdiction they were possessed of, at and before the passage of the act
of the 3" of March 1845.” admitting Florida into the Union. A
careful analysis of these acts presents us with these results: -
1"That Congress constituted and established in the Territory two
Superior Courts, and vested the judicial power in them “and in such
inferior Courts and Justices of the Peace, as the Legislative Council of
the Territory may, from time to time establish.”
2" That by virtue of those acts, the jurisdiction conferred upon
the Supreme Courts, and which they were seized and possessed of,
at and before the passage of the act of the 3" of March, 1845. above
referred to may be summed up as follows:
1* The jurisdiction derived from an act entitled “An act of to es-
tablish the judicial Courts of the United States,” approved the 24"
of September 1789,” and the act entitled “An act in addition to the
act entitled “An act to establish the judicial Courts of the United
States,” approved the 2" of March 1793;” both of which acts were
extended to, and given effect in, the Territory of Florida, by the two
acts of Congress you refer to, -the one of the 30" of March 1822.”
and the other of the 3rd of March 1823." and vested in its Courts
these jurisdictions:

the authority of the United States, committed within the respective
districts, or upon the high seas &c.

2" Exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of Admiralty
and Maritime jurisdiction &"; inclusive of all seizures on land or sea,
or on other waters emptying therein &".
3" Exclusive original cognizance for penalties and forfeitures in-
curred under the laws of the United States.
4" Cognizance, concurrent with the Courts of the several States,
or the Circuit Courts, of all causes where an alien sues for a tort only
in violation of the law of nations, or a Treaty of the United States.
5" Cognizance in like manner of all suits at common Law where
the United States sue, and the matter in dispute amounts, exclusive
of costs, to the sum or value of $100; and of all other suits of a civil
nature at common law, or in equity, where the matter in dispute
exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of $500;—and where an
alien is a party, or where the suit is between a citizen of the State
where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another State.
6" Exclusive jurisdiction of all suits against Consuls or Vice Con-
suls, save in certain cases, excepted in the first named act.
7" Power to hold special sessions of the Courts for the trial of
criminal causes—to take, and in certain cases to invest, in others the
power to take, bail &"
2" In addition to the jurisdiction thus set forth, and thus derived,
the acts of 1822, and 1823. above referred to, and of 1826. conferred
and vested the following jurisdictions in those Courts:
8" Jurisdiction in all criminal cases.
9" Exclusive jurisdiction in all capital cases.
10" Original and appellate jurisdiction in all other crimes and of-
fences, committed against the laws of the said Territory.
11" Original jurisdiction in all civil cases in law and equity, whether
arising under the laws of the said Territory, or otherwise, where the
sum in controversy shall amount to $100—and in all suits in which
the United States shall be parties, whatever the amount.
12" Appellate jurisdiction in all civil cases originating in the infe-
rior Courts of the Territory, whatever may be the amount in contro-
versy.
13"All other jurisdiction of a general nature, which pertain to Courts
of the United States as such, and per se, wherever they may be
holden, and perform their functions.
Such were the depositions of the judicial power in Florida, and
such the jurisdiction which pertained to them at and before the act
of the 3" of March 1845. by virtue whereof Florida was admitted
into the Union on an equal footing with the original states in all respects
whatever” It is all important to the attainment of right results in
the premises, that we should know, with all attainable precision,

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 1059
when this act takes effect, upon the existing Government of Florida.
Let us equire then,
1" Whether the act admitting Florida into the Union took effect
from and after its passage?
If it did, it is plain that the Territorial Government of Florida is
at an end, and if the consequences attributed to the demise of the
Government have ensued, its executive, legislative and judicial pow-
ers have shared its fate. The very functionaries who ministered
therein, being divested of jurisdiction, are void of authority. The
newly created offices not being filled up, are void of all capacities for
business, and destitute of all the means to enforce authority. Suits,
prosecutions and processes, abated by inaction are “without day” in
Court, and a sullen interregnum prevades all Florida–Chaos seizing
upon the sceptre of order, reigns in triumph over reason and the laws,
and all the most valued rights of citizenship are under the capricious
and ruthless dominion of the law of the strongest!
If these are to be deemed some of the general and necessary results
of abolishing one Government, before and until another was consti-
tuted to stand in its stead, and perform its functions, they are results,
of a surety, which Congress could neither have designed nor expected.
Its own organic laws had called the Territorial Government into being,
and under American usages had parcelled out its jurisdiction to ap-
propriate Departments. No express provision in the act of admission
abrogated these laws, ex instante with its passage, and if they were
not abrogated then how are they abrogated yet? If they stand
repealed, it is plain that implication has overcome intention, anddone
it all. That intention of making the Government and its authority
and jurisdiction survive the passage of the act referred to. is every
where conspicuous in the act entitled “An act supplemental to the
act for the admission of Florida and Iowa into the Union, and for
other purposes”" which was passed on the same day with the act to
which it is supplemental, and is otherwise and plainly manifest.
Proofs of this are readily adduced:
1"The 2"Section provides—“That all the laws of the United States
which are not locally inapplicable, shall have the same force or effect
within the said State of Florida as else where within the United
States.”
What laws could those have been which were to have force and
effect in the State, but those which had previously “force and effect”
in the Territory of Florida, which could not have been locally inap-
plicable until the Territorial Government, to which Congress had
made them locally applicable, had passed away, in the presence and
"1 5 STAT. 788.


## p. 1060 (#1076) ##########################################

1060 T E R R IT OR I. A. L. PA P E R S
by virtue of an actual change of Government, and when most of those
laws which conferred jurisdiction (as I shall shew hereafter) will and
must survive all changes of Government in Florida?
2" The third section provides for the establishment of a District
Court which shall be held in said District, to consist of one Judge &" &"
who shall, in all things have and exercise the same jurisdiction and
powers, which were by law given to the Judge of the Kentucky district
&" All this is the language of the future and not of the present. The
Judge is “to be appointed. The “jurisdiction and powers” are to be
vested in him. They cannot vest until he is appointed, and then
and not till then, he “shall have and exercise the jurisdiction and
powers” intended to be conferred. And what becomes of “the jurisdic-
tion and powers” ad interim? Are they in abeyance? The act does
not say so. No reason is assignable why it should be so. No conflict
or repugnancy can arise, unless, and until there are two judcatures in
esse, claiming the investiture and exercise of the same jurisdiction.
No motive to produce an interregnum is attributable to Congress—
no purpose of doing so is any where manifest, and in the silence of the
laws, and where the motive and the purpose are both wanting, it
would be both illogical and visionary to conclude that such an effect
had been wrought.
3” The sixth section provides “that these shall be allowed to the
Judge aforesaid an annual compensation of $2000, to commence from
the date of his appointment, to be paid quarter yearly at the Treasury
of the United States.” This vests an unqualified discretion in the
President and Senate to determine when the appointment shall be
made, and allows them an indefinite locus penitentiae in which to
concur and fix their choice; and thus at one and the same time legalizes
such delays as may intervene, & saves the office and its jurisdiction
from lapsing, for nonuser, ad-interim.
4" The appropriation act, whose passage bears even date with
those of the two acts referred to (3rd March 1845)” provides for the
payment of the public functionaries who administer the Territorial
Government of Florida, in its various Departments, by virtue of
previous laws and appointments, until they shall be regularly super-
seded by the organization of the substituted State Government, and
of the newly created District Court of the United States for the State
of Florida.
5" In point of fact none of the disastrous results attributed to the
immediacy with which the act was supposed to take effect, from and
after its passage, have ensued. The old Government remains in full
and effective operation. All the public officers continue to perform

the duties and receive the salaries which prior laws prescribed & es-
tablished. The Courts are still open to to enforce their rights and
redress their wrongs; penalties are still exacted, and punishments
inflicted, for disobedience to the laws; and all submit, and none com-
plain. Practically, therefore, the act, as yet, has been without effect;
and as similar delays attended the entrance of all the other new states
into the Union, and no interregnum took place in any, we are bound to
conclude that these practical results were at once foreseen and des-
ignated. Both in fact and in purpose, then, the Territorial Govern-
ment of Florida survives the passage of the act of admission. None
attribute to that measure instantaneous effects upon the existing state
of things. The Government of the Union still maintains and exer-
cises its accustomed authority over the people of Florida, and they still
recognize its power and jurisdiction, and submit to its authority. We
can expect, therefore, nothing less than that this state of things will
continue as it now is, up to the time when the state Government shall
be organized and put in operation; and consequently, that the Superior
Courts, with all the branches of jurisdiction which the analysis I have
made in a previous page enumerated (from N° 1. to N° 13, both
inclusive) and assigns to them, will remain unchanged during that
interval. Our next inquiry will naturally be:
2". What changes will be wrought in the existing state of things
by the actual organization of the State Government, and its entrance
upon the functions assigned to it, by its own constitution, and by the
Constitution and laws of the Union?
An essential and immediate consequence must be, to put an end to
all the Executive and Legislative functions which are incompatible
with the Supremacy and exclusiveness of all that municipal sovereignty
which the states hold in reserve, and, while this Union lasts, may not
part with, nor this Government acquire. Upon the judicial power,
the effect of the change will be far less thorough and radical, because
the most important portions of that power must survive all changes
which are made. The third section of the supplemental act referred
to specially provides, that the District Judge, to be appointed under
that act “shall in all things have and exercise the same jurisdiction
and powers which were, by law given to the Judge of the Kentucky
District, under an act entitled “An act to establish the judicial Courts
of the United States.” What such “jurisdiction and powers” are,
are ascertained and condensed in the synopsis, (already presented)
wherein they are enumerated from N° 1 to N° 7, both inclusive; and
which are therefore not only now in force, but are to remain in force
after all shall have been accomplished, which both acts of Congress
may have designed. The Superior Courts will retain, furthermore,


## p. 1062 (#1078) ##########################################

1062 T E R R IT OR I. A L PA P E R S
that portion of jurisdiction which they acquired under the act of 1826,”
and which given them cognizance of all suits in which the United States
shall be a party, whatever be the amount in controversy; and also
such further jurisdiction as is referred to, and embraced in N° 13. of
the synopsis I have made. It is unnecessary to decide, at this time,
what will be the duration of the two branches of the jurisdiction last
referred to; further than to say, and such is my opinion, that they will
last quite as long as the Courts upon which they were conferred. Be-
yond then, no portion of the jurisdiction vested in the Superior Courts,
by the several acts of Congress of 1822–’23,” and '26 will,” in my
judgement, survive the change of Government, when it is effected.
But it may be said, that jurisdiction is one thing, and its depositions
quite another. That jurisdiction may survive the event, which
changes the depositories. So it may, when the changes take place.
I do not question at all the efficacy of the 4" section of the XVII.th.
article of the Florida Constitution, to transfer from the Superior
Courts all suits, prosecutions, and processes, appropriate to the state
tribunals, and where it shall appear that the concurrent jurisdiction
of the Superior Courts is taken away as aforesaid, as soon as the
State Legislature of Florida shall have prescribed the occasion and
the modus in which it shall be done. Further than this I contest its
jurisdiction to go. I regard the provisions of tis constitution quite
as impotent to abolish the Superior Courts, as I have already main-
tained it is impotent to preserve them. The doctrine would be as
novel as it would be mischievous and disorganizing, that the state
authorities were competent to abolish the Courts of the United States
or to dispose of, or disturb, the Government causes pending thither.
The Superior Courts of Florida were constituted and established by
Congress, and in the exercise of its rightful authority; the Judges,
the District Attorneys, and the Marshals who minister therein, were
appointed by the President and Senate of the United States, and they
are paid out of the common Treasury of the Union. Hence, though
their functions may be restricted, and their jurisdiction abridged,
under the new order of things, both the functionaries and the offices
will outlive the change of government, and for such length of time as
Congress permits. If the state authorities of Florida may abridge
the duration of the Superior Courts, and control or disturb them in
their allotted jurisdiction and functions, or put an end to the Govern-
ment causes pending therein, what forbids their wielding a like control
over the District Court, and the jurisdiction, and functions, and

causes, of which it may be seized and possessed, whenever the public
authorities of this Government may put it in operation?
Upon the whole, I am of opinion that the Superior Courts have
at this time, and will continue to have, until the State Government
is put in full and effective operation, all the powers and jurisdiction
they possessed at the time that the act for the admission of Florida
into the Union was passed; that the functionaries who minister
therein are as competent now as heretofore to the performance of
all their duties; and that the causes pending therein at the time of
the passage of that act or since that time, must “keep day” in Court
until regularly disposed of thither, unless before then the State Govern-
ment shall be put in operation; and that, from and after that time,
that portion of the causes pending therein appropriate to the state
tribunals, may be transferred thither for prosecution and trial.
Hence, and furthermore, my instructions are, that the Government
suits, prosecutions and processes pending in the Superior Courts
be proceeded in, & that new suits, & prosecutions (appropriate to
their jurisdiction) be instituted therein precisely as if the act for the
admission of Florida into the Union had not been passed."

following order, to wit: first, the amount due to individual claimants,
and secondly, those due to the Territory of Florida, provided that
the whole amount of supplies paid for shall not exceed the quantity
of each description to which the said troops were entitled by existing
laws.”
By a joint resolution, approved March 1” 1845,” it is provided,
“that nothing contained in the joint resolution of April 30" 1844,
or in any other Act or resolution shall be understood or construed to
prevent the Secretary of War from allowing and paying any just and
equitable claims for supplies furnished, or advances or loans of money
made to provide for the defence of the inhabitants and suppression
of Indian hostilities in the Territory of Florida, provided that the
amount so allowed and paid shall not exceed the sums already appro-
priated by law.”
On the 4” of March 1839, the Legislative authority of Florida,
by an Act,” a copy of which is annexed, authorized the Governor
of the Territory to raise any sum of money, not exceeding one hundred
thousand dollars, by issuing bonds or otherwise pledging the faith of
the Territory for the re-payment thereof.
In pursuance of this authority, the Governor of Florida borrowed
a certain sum of the Union Bank of Florida and a certain other sum
of the Southern Life Insurance and Trust Company and issued bonds
to secure the payment thereof; a copy of which is annexed."
These bonds, to the amount of forty six thousand dollars, in the
hands of persons to whom they have been negotiated, as it is alleged
for a full consideration, are now presented and payment thereof
claimed of the United States, under the said joint resolution of the
1* of March 1845, and the Attorney General is respectfully referred
to the different views taken by my predecessors on the subject of
the payment of these Florida Bonds. Mr Secretary Porter decided
that any balance standing to the credit of the Territory of Florida
might, (before Congress interposed and directed the disposal of it)
be applied to the payment of the claim of the Bond holders. Both
Mr Secretary Spencer and Mr Secretary Wilkins held a different
opinion, as the case then stood, but since the adoption of the reso-
lution of the 1* of March 1845, the latter decided that the bond
holders ought to be paid. You have his views in extenso in one of

the papers herewith transmitted." The last resolution—that of
the 1* of March last—removes the restrictions imposed by the
preceding resolution—One question is—Could these bond holders
have been paid under the laws and resolutions as they stood before
the resolution of the 1" of March last, if these restrictions had not
been attached? The second question is; does the last resolution
do more than remove these restrictions, or does it confer or imply
authority in case it did not exist before, (the restrictions being laid
out of view) to pay the bonds now presented for payment.

SIR I have the honor to forward by the mail of to day a large
amount of work to your office from which you will perceive that
we have not been idle. The necessity for employing an extra clerk
for a short time arose from my very great anxiety to bring up some
arrears with the Registers which were chargeable to former negligence,
needless now to refer to, but which shall not again occur. I am
happy to be enabled to report to you that by great exertion & dili-
gence we have the work of the season fairly before us & shall without
doubt regularly keep pace with the surveys as they are returned
into the office without again infringing upon the limit noted in your
instructions of the 22nd Ult.”
The reasons for detaining the Maps now sent which have been
ready for transmission some 3 or 4 months will be found in my letters
of 13th Jany" 24th Feb’11 & 10th March” in this present year.
I may again remark that the Deputies who performed the work
now reported & who are all in the field left with me at the time of
their departure, full vouchers covering their entire claim which will
be forwarded so soon as the amount is transmitted to pay them.
The statements, showing the acknowledged balance in each case,
are in the hands of Merchants of this City, who advanced the several
amounts for their accommodation & have been deeply disappointed &
chagrined at the delays to which they have been subjected, the
vouchers for the sums actually paid were forwarded with my last
Quarterly account on the 31* March 1845.” By this it will be
seen Sir, that I am a creditor to the Government (including the
$59.62 bal. reported as due for the survey of private claims) to the
amount of $264.81 cts Upon this subject also I beg leave to refer
to my letters of 13th Jany" 28 Feb” & 10th March” present year.
I most respectfully ask that the amount necessary to pay the
acknowledged balance due for the surveys of 1844, herein refered
to, be transmitted with all convenient despatch together with the
sum due for the survey & location of private Land Claims reported

SIR I have considered your communication of the 3" Instant, as
to the extent of power conferred by the Joint Resolution of the 1"
March 1845,” which is amendatory of the Resolution passed 30"
April 1844,” respecting the application of certain appropriations
heretofore made.
I understand from the papers which were transmitted with your
communication, that the Bonds of which payment is demanded, were
given for loans of money made to provide for the defence of the inhab-
itants and suppression of Indian hostilities in the territory of Florida:
That the money so loaned was expended for those objects; and that
reimbursement has not been made to Florida of the expenditures thus
incurred, or by Florida to the Bond Holders.
It also appears that the appropriations made by Congress for these
objects by two Acts of 23* August 1842* are not exhausted, and that
a sum now stands on the books of the Treasury, to the credit of this
head of appropriation, more than sufficient to pay the Bonds now
presented.

The material question presented for my opinion is: Does the Res-
olution of 1* March 1845, confer or imply, authority to pay the
bonds now presented for payment?
The Joint Resolution of 1845 declares, that nothing contained in
that of 30" April 1844 or in any other Act or Resolution, shall be
understood or construed to prevent the Secretary of War, from allow-
ing or paying any just and equitable claims for supplies furnished, or
advances or loans of money, made to provide for the defence of the
inhabitants and suppression of Indian hostilities in the Territory of
Florida, provided that the amount so allowed and paid shall not ex-
ceed the sums already appropriated by law.
In construing this Resolution, the intention of the Legislature is a
fit and proper subject of enquiry and when ascertained, must control
the construction. That intention must be collected from the Act
itself, and other Acts in pari materia. Whatever the terms em-
ployed may be, they are to be construed to effectuate the intention of
the Legislature. By the Act of the Florida Legislature of 4* March
1839,” the Governor was authorized to raise any sum of money, not
exceeding One Hundred Thousand dollars, and to issue Bonds for the
same. In execution of this power, he issued these Bonds. By an
Act of Congress of 23* August 1842, an appropriation was made for
preventing and suppressing hostilities in Florida, to be expended under
the direction of the Secretary of War; and by another Act of the same
date, provision was made for the payment of the Florida militia with
specified restrictions.” By an Joint Resolution Act of 3" March
1843,” the Accounting Officers of the Treasury are authorized to
settle claims for supplies furnished the Florida militia, on principles
of equity and justice, under the direction of the Secretary of War.
By the Joint Resolution of 30" April 1844,” restrictions are imposed
on the settlement of these claims and the accounting officers are
directed to discharge the claims for said supplies in the following order,
to wit: 1" the amounts due to individual claimants; and 2* to the
Territory of Florida; with a proviso, that the whole amount of supplies
paid for, shall not exceed the quantity of each description to which
the said troops were entitled by existing laws.
The Acts of 1842 and the Joint Resolutions of 1843 and 1844, all
required that accounts should be rendered for audit and settlement,
which would at least shew on their face the particular description
of supply for which payment was demanded. For without this the

FL OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 1069
accounting officers could not determine whether the proviso last
quoted presented an obstacle to payment. There was no difficulty
in meeting this requisition of law, by the two classes of creditors to
whom payment was directed by the Resolution of April 1844. In-
dividual claimants and the Territorial Government, could readily ex-
hibit the items of an account for supplies furnished. But there was a
third class of claimants, the holders of Bonds issued under the Act of
4 March 1839, who could not do this. They had loaned their money
for the protection and defence of the Territory, but had no agency or
Knowledge of its expenditure. And in this state of the law and of the
claims, the Joint Resolution of 1* March 1845 was passed. It
differed in its terms from those which had preceded it in two important
particulars. For the first time, payment of just and equitable claims
for loans or advances of money, made for the defence of the inhabitants
of Florida is spoken of; and the proviso removes the restriction which
limited payments for each kind of supply, to the quantity of each
authorized by law. Why were these important modifications made?
What loans or advances of money were thus provided for? The
Resolution of 1844 had explicitly directed, that Florida should be
paid all claims for supplies, but the proviso implied that such pay-
ments were to be made on accounts specifying the description of
supplies furnished, and it is not to be supposed, that it was in the con-
templation of Congress to pay to the Territorial Government loans
or advances made by individuals, and which were unredeemed by the
Territory. Individual claimants had been preferred in the order of
payment to the Territorial Government for supplies furnished, and
were paid directly at the Treasury of the United States. By previous
enactment the United States had assumed the expenditures of the
Territory, and the payment to individuals for supplies furnished in
the suppression of Indian hostilities, and by the Resolution of 1845,
it seems clear to me, that it was the intention of Congress to assume
and pay claims for loans and advances made to Florida for this great
National object; and the terms employed are sufficient for that purpose.
I am not aware of any rule of construction which would forbid that
this intent should be carried into effect. I am therefore of opinion,
that the Resolution of March 1845 is directory, and that the thirty
five Bonds now presented for payment having been given for loans
made for the defence of the inhabitants, and suppression of Indian
hostilities in the Territory of Florida, may be paid under the authority
of that Resolution, subject alone to the restriction of the proviso, that
the amount so allowed and paid shall not exceed the sums already
appropriated by law.
Being of opinion that the Resolution has this effect, I have not
deemed it necessary to examine the first question presented. The


## p. 1070 (#1086) ##########################################

course of reasoning adopted would seem to lead to the conclusion, that
such payments could not be made without the authority conferred by
the Resolution of 1845. I do not however, intend to express an
opinion as to the equitable right of the Bond holders to be substituted
for the Territorial Government. I repeat that I have not deemed it
important to give an opinion on any other question than on the ex-
tent of authority conferred by the Joint Resolution of 1* March 1845,
construed with the series of Acts and Resolutions in pari materia.”

SIR, I have the honor to return herewith the letter to you from
the Secretary of War, of the 10" instant,” and its enclosures, relative
to the additional reservation of twenty five miles around the district
* Ante, p. 1072.

set apart for the use and occupancy of the Seminoles in Florida, by
Gen' Macomb in 1839.
On the accompanying diagram” this district is represented, as
near as practicable, by red lines. The yellow lines embrace the
twenty five miles additional, which the War Department suggests shall
be reserved as neutral ground. These lines, you will perceive, em-
brace a number of Townships marked T, of which the Township
boundaries only have been surveyed; and a few of those colored blue,
which have been subdivided and recently proclaimed for sale, but
not yet offered.
It is presumed that the object of the War Department would
be obtained by limiting this reservation to twenty miles, the bounda-
ries of which are indicated by green lines on the accompanying diagram,
excluding the whole of Townships 28 & 29 of Range 22, and Town-
ships 33 and 34 of Range 21, which could therefore be offered in
accordance with the proclamation now issued. By thus reducing this
reservation, the symmetry of these townships would be preserved,
and the lands would probably bring a better price to the Government,
and be more valuable to the settlers;–and the only interferences
with the proclamations, would be the suspension of a part of Town-
ship 24, Range 29, and the whole of fractional Township 26, Range
31.40
I respectfully submit this matter for your consideration, and upon
receipt of your decision the necessary orders will be immediately
issued to the Surveyor General and the Land officers.

THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:TD, ST Misc. Lets. to Pres.]
TREASURY DEPARTMENT May 17th 1845
SIR, I have the honor herewith to submit the enclosed communi-
cations from the Secretary of War and the Commissioner of the Gen.'
Land office," with the accompanying papers, relative to an additional
reservation of public lands around the District set apart for the use
and occupancy of the Seminoles in Florida.
The Secretary of War proposes a reservation of twenty five miles
around the District in question.” The Commissioner of the General
Land Office suggests that the reservation be limited to twenty miles,
as a reservation of that extent would probably accomplish the object
of the War Department, & the only interference with the proclama-
tion for sale now issued, would be the suspension of a part of town-
ship 24. Range 29 and the whole of fractional township 26. Range 30.
On the enclosed diagram, the Seminole District is represented, as
nearly as practicable, by red lines, the reservation proposed by the
War Department, as neutral ground by yellow lines, and the reserva-
tion as recommended by the Commissioner, by green lines. The
townships colored blue have been proclaimed for sale, and it will be
perceived that the reservation suggested by the Commissioner would
interfere with the existing proclamation only to the extent before
stated, and would preserve unbroken townships 25 & 29 of Range 22
& townships 33 & 34 of Range 21 which being now proclaimed, could
by the adoption of that reservation, be offered for sale.
I approve of the reservation proposed by the Commissioner, and
respectfully submit the papers, with my recommendations that it
receive the sanction of the President.”
I have the honor to be, Very respectfully Yr obt. Servt.

A copy of this map will at an early day be forwarded to your office.

making it desirable that the country should be surveyed & brought
into market as rapidly as possible.
In view of this fact & in accordance with the suggestions contained
in your letter of Instructions of 17* Ult:" I shall confine the Surveys
for the coming season principally to the subdivision of those Town-
ships heretofore surveyed which contain lands desirable for immedi-

In order that there might be no impediment to the sale of those

been making exertions to have the private claims in that vicinity
located. One of my Deputies has recently returned—having located

terests of the service, and supposed necessities of the case—The Map
of 1839, prepared by Lieutenant Blake and other officers, is accurate—
There is another material inaccuracy in tracing the line which Igranted

instead of the south branch of Pease-Creek—see text and map here-

[NA:TD, ST Lets. from Individuals, Land Offices:ALS]
STAUGUSTINE June 9. 1845
DEAR SIR I wrote you a few hurried lines on my in to this city.
Lest it may not have reached you, I beg leave to repeat its subject.
I observe that Land sales have been advertised for Florida." The
late administration had concured with me in a policy respecting the
lands in Florida, which I was in hopes w” meet with your concurence.
We require military strength upon the exposed peninsula of Florida.
The only way to secure this is by encouraging the settlement of small
farmers—I cannot explain to you fully by letter the mode in which the
disposition of the public lands can be so arranged as to effect this, for
I have not time. But this is certain, that the sales you propose,
especially at the season appointed, will throw our lands entirely into
the hands of speculators, and the consequence will be that emigration
of the kind required to give strength will be arrested, & we shall have
upon the most exposed & vulnerable point of the south—in fact the
very key to the South—the element of weakness which an immense
slave population will create. That you may form some conception
of this, I will mention that before the war in one of the peninsula
counties with a slave population of fourteen hundred there were only
10 or 15 voters.
I sincerely trust that you will cause the order for sale to be re-
scinded, or at all events will direct it to be postponed to December
next, before which time I will be able to confer with you.
In haste Yrs Very Respy

INDEX NOTE
In compiling the list of names of persons for this index, deficiencies in spelling
found in the text have been corrected, in so far as sources now available permit,
and variants found throughout the text have been assembled in parentheses. The
nearly illegible character of the handwriting in some instances, which leaves the
reader in doubt as to the writer's intent, and the obvious ignorance, or careless-
ness, often displayed by the signatories account for many variations in orthog-
raphy. With respect to the signers of petitions, like names, with identical spell-
ing, are also frequently attached to successive documents on related subjects from
the same locality; yet a comparison of the handwriting discloses occasional impor-
tant differences. In such instances separate entries have been made in the index,
though the reader is warned that names were often written in by hands other than
the subscribers’; finality in this regard cannot therefore be established in every
case. On the other hand the fact that the same name is variously spelled in
sequential documents does not argue against identity of person, which is likewise
disclosed by a comparison of handwriting as well as by such other tests as docu-
ments of legal record, genealogical data, and whatever knowledge of the various
residences of a given person may be derived from the papers embodied in the
present volume. But whenever there is doubt as to such identity a separate
entry has been made. In some instances the index material is organized according
to office or function under a duplication of the principal entry (see DuVal, Wil-
liam P.).
Names of English origin have been listed in the index as written (if the signature
was not by mark); but Spanish names, which often appear in the text written
phonetically, with much variation, have been entered in the index under the
forms commonly used in available sources, followed by their variants in paren-
theses.
