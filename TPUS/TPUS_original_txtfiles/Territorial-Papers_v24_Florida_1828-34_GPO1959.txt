DELEGATE WHITE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR

Ho OF REPs May 1* 1828
SIR, The repeated complaints I have received in relation to Fugitive
slaves, within the limits of the Florida Indians,” & the difficulties
necessarily arising in relation to the rights of individuals make it
necessary that some certain mode should be adopted for the more
speedy & satisfactory decission of these questions.
I respectfully suggest that instructions may be issued to the agent
to refer all these questions to the Judge of the District & that the
Judge be requested to decide & report the cases to the Department so
that an order may be issued on the basis of a Judicial decision"—
This course under such regulations as may be devised by the wisdom
of the Department will greatly promote the harmony of that part of
the country & save the Department itself a number of vexatious &
difficult investigations—
I have the honor to be yr most obt st

Humphreys wrote to McKenney, Mar. 7, 1828 (loc. cit., Lets. Recd., Seminole;

strayed Cook negro. McKenney answered, Mar. 27, 1828 (loc. cit., Lets. Sent,
Bk. 4; printed, Sprague, op. cit., p. 48), that such force could not be used, and
Brooke informed Humphreys, May 2, 1828 (Sprague, op. cit., p. 52), that he had
no men to spare for the duty. Concerning other cases involving runaway negroes,

DEAR GENERAL, I received from the Office of the Commissary
Gen' of Subs. an extract of a letter from L. F. D. Newcomb addressed
to you," and which I submitted to the Postmaster General represent-
ing, that “they can place no confidence in the Post Office Establish-
ment in Allachua”—and that the P. M. is not trustworthy, and igno-
rant. The P. M. General desires to ascertain whether there are any
acts or omissions of the P. M. at “Wanton's which can be subjected
to investigation, or whether the representation is founded on the
notorious character of the P. M. which deprives him of confidence
in his station. If M Newcomb will furnish more specific information,
of either kind, an investigation can be instituted (without reference
to his name, unless required by extraordinary circumstances not to be
anticipated.)
The Postmaster General has authorized the establishment of a
private P. O. at the “Seminole Agency,”—the proceeds of postage
being allowed for the transportation of the mail from the nearest
P. O.—on account of its distance from the mail route."
I have the honor to be D Gen. with high respect Your obed. Serv.

TO HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, You will direct Col" Humphreys, in order to a speedy decision
on all cases which may be submitted for the recovery of run-away
Slaves, to refer them to the Judge of the District; and if his decision
be favorable to the claimants, you will order the Slaves to be delivered
in pursuance of that decision the claimant giving bond to abide by
such other legal proceedings as the parties holding the Slaves may
think proper to adopt.
You will address the Judge a line requesting him to decide and
report the cases to you, to be forwarded by you to the Department
for its information. Let the reports of the Judge be on the basis of a
judicial decision.”—

20 Printed also in Sprague, Fla. War, p. 54.
21 Judge Smith wrote Humphreys, May 10, 1828 (ibid., pp. 53–54), that property
belonging to the Indians or in their possession could not legally be taken from
them, that their annuity could not be withheld because they failed to surrender
property claimed by whites, and that claims involving runaway negroes were to
be referred to him. A further letter from id. to id., Oct. 13, 1828 (NA, OIA Lets.
Recd., Fla.), gives an opinion as to Indian title to property, repeats that their
annuity could not be withheld, and describes the manner of trying claims to
runaway negroes. See also Smith to Del. White, Dec. 4, 1828 (loc. cit.), which
was referred by the latter to the Secretary of War, Dec. 30, 1828 (NA, WD, SW
Reg. of Lets. Recd., No. 24, W 34; the text is missing). DuVal was instructed,
Jan. 2, 1829 (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 5), that Judge Smith's decision as to the
ownership of slaves was to be considered final and that delivery to claimants was
not to be preceded by any other report or judgment. The Secretary of War was
informed by McKenney, Apr. 15, 1830 (loc. cit., Bk. 6), that $5 a day was a fair
allowance to Smith and expressed doubts as to Smith's service.

The charge of postage on proposals for publications, like that which
you have enclosed to me, is the Same as on letters. They are neither
newspapers nor pamphlets, the only articles on which the law makes
abatement from letter postage. The distance from Claiborne is more
than 80 miles; therefore the postage is 12% cents for a single letter;
and three bills, besides the paper which covers them, makes a quad-
ruple letter, amounting to 50 cents postage.”

and the return of the documents enumerated—The whole Subject
Shall have my earliest attention—The field notes Shall be made
agreeably to the form recently received and the paper to correspond
as nearly with the former, as it can be procured.
I had dispatched a few weeks Since, my Surveyors South & East
for the completion of the work contemplated in my estimate, but they
returned immediately owing to a fall of rain having inundated the
country, So as to render it impassible—I have therefore dispatched
them west with instructions to complete the remaining private claims
than can be found, and all and every unfinished work that may be
practicable and which ought to be Surveyed—The ensueing fall must
be devoted to the Section of Country South & East as the only period
that Supplies can be transported into the interior to Sustain the
Surveyors during the execution of that work; and I am impressed
with a belief from recent information had, that a Small portion only
of that Section of Country will admit of Settlement—Your letter of
the 17" Ult” covering a Commission” from the President together
with a blank bond has been received and Shall be attended to without
delay.

Engineer Department. WASHINGTON, May 28* 1828–
TO THE HON. SAML. SOUTHARD Acts Secretary of War
SIR I have examined the communications of Mr Jos White of
Florida, relative to the extinguishment of the title of an individual to
the site intended to be occupied by the Fortifications on Santa Rosa
Island for the defence of the Harbour of Pensacola, for which an
appropriation was made at the late Session of Congress,” & I have
the honour to report: That it has been always the practice of this
Department, before proceeding to the construction of Fortifications, to
obtain in behalf of the Government, an undisputed title to the site
to be occupied by them: Although in the present case, no part of the
Appropriation was expressly stated in the Law to be applicable to the
purchase of the Site, yet it is deemed perfectly competent to the War
Department to make such an application of it, as it appears by
reference to the records of this Dept that this course was taken, under
circumstances precisely similar, in the cases of the works on Oak
Island & Bogue Point in North Carolina—I beg leave therefore to
recommend, that should the title of the person who claims the site
on Santa Rosa Island be found good, the Sanction of the War Depart-
ment be given to the extinguishment of it by means of a portion
of the Appropriation already made for the Fortifications at
Pensacola *—
respectfully Submitted
AL" MACOMB M Ge" Ch E
* Filed with Del. White to the Chief Engineer, May 26, 1828, which enclosed
documents regarding the ownership of the tract in question, granted to Vicente
S. Pintado, Dec. 17, 1817, and subsequently purchased at a marshal's sale by
Henry Michelet on whose behalf White made an offer to sell the land for $4,000.
* The act approved May 24, 1828 (4 STAT. 310), provided $20,000 for fortifica-
tions at Pensacola. See the Chief Engineer to the Secretary of War, May 7, 1828
(NA, GLO, Abandoned Mil. Reserv. File).
* A deed executed by Joseph M. White, attorney in fact of Henry Michelet, on
May 28, 1828, conveyed 1,181 acres of land on the west end of Santa Rosa Island

TALLAHASSEE, Indian Office May 30" 1828
COLo THO" L. McKENNEY
SIR, I had the honor, to receive your letter of the 7" Inst,” together
with a letter from the Commissioner of the General Land Office,” and
one from M* Allen, the Agent of the Kentucky Deaf and Dumb
Asylum,” in relation to the reservation of a tract of land in the County
of Gadsden, made in favor of Neamathla, an Indian chief;
The Chief has never complied with any of the provisions of this
reservation, and absolutely refused to reside on it. Neamathla left
Florida, in January 1825, and returned to the Creek Nation, of which
he was a native and is now Chief of a Town, in that Nation. In my
opinion, it would be inexpedient, longer to reserve this Tract of Land,
for the purposes designated by the Treaty, with the Florida Indians.
Neamathla has repeatedly assured me, that he never would reside on
the Land.
I am with great respect Your Ob' Servt.

it inexpedient any longer to retain the land granted to Neamathla by
the Treaty with the Florida Ind" for his use as intended by the treaty—

letter, namely—That Neamathla abandoned his reservation in 1825,
& refuses to return to it; and that it is not, at present, occupied by
any descendants or connexions of his, whose names have been fur-
nished to the Superintendant or agent, in compliance with the “Addi-

Post Office, PENSACOLA, 30th May, 1828.
SIR,-The Captains of Wessels, which regularly run between this
Port and New Orleans, inform me that you do not require them to
deposit their letters in your Office: this circumstance makes it difficult
for me to enforce the provisions of the 17th section of the Post Office
law;” and I have respectfully to request your co-operation in getting
them into the habit of complying therewith. I have regularly en-
forced the law, so far as I could, ever since I was appointed Post
Master, and I have been censured by some for so doing, on the ground
that you omit to do so.
I am of opinion, that the charge of land postage on letters, by vessels,
from Pensacola to New Orleans, is not required by the law, and that
six cents only should be charged by you on each packet or letter; but,
as you are of a different opinion, I shall request the decision of the
Post Master General on the question.”

POST OFFICE, New Orleans, 5th June, 1828.
SIR.—The Captains of Wessels who have told you that I do not
require them to deposite their letters in my Office," have knowingly
told a thing they know to be false, and have attempted to impose
upon you. When Captains of vessels call to deliver their letters, I
generally enquire if what they deliver to me is all they have; they are
also by law obliged, on making their entry at the Custom House, to
swear that they have delivered all letters in their possession into the
Post Office;—in taking command of the vessel they swear to support
the Constitution and laws of the United States; therefore, if any
Captains of Wessels trading with your place, have delivered letters
contrary to Law, they have committed perjury; and, if their names
and the facts were to come to my knowledge, I would prosecute them
immediately. I would therefore feel under much obligation to you,
if you would give me some information on the subject.
I charge, and have, since our correspondence on the subject, charged
only six cents on letters from your place by vessels.”

claims in Florida,” and also a copy of the Report of the Register &
Rec' of the Land Office at St Augustine acting as Commissioners,"
& referred to in the 2* Section of the Act.
You will perceive that the 1st Section of this act confirms specifically
three claims in West Florida, and such claims in East Florida as have
been recommended for confirmation by the Commissioners or by the
Register & Receiver acting as Commissioners on the conditions and
to the extent particularly stated in the Act.
These claims correspond very nearly, if not precisely, with those
referred to in the 12th Section of the Act approved the 8th of Feb”
1827." and it is therefore necessary that under the provisions of that
Section they be accurately laid down on the Township plats returned
to the Land Offices and to this Office.
If the three claims in West Florida confirmed by this Act have not
been laid down on your plats, you will cause them to be so laid down
as Soon as practicable. I understand that the claimant of No 10.
is disposed to avail himself of the conditions of the Act.
The 4th Section of the Act having prolonged the time for the ad-
judicating on the private land claims in East Florida, I am appre-
hensive that a further delay of the public Surveys will be unavoidable.
If however on advising with & obtaining the necessary information
from the Register & Rec" at St Augustine, you may be of opinion that
you can with propriety extend your surveys in East Florida, you will
proceed to do so as early as practicable in the ensuing Autumn.
The 6th Section of the Act provides for a judicial decision of all
the claims under the Treaty with Spain, not settled by the provisions
of this Act and which have not been reported as antidated or other-
wise fraudulent, and which contain a greater quantity of land than
the Commissioners were authorized to decide, as it would be unad-
visable for the Government to proceed to the sale of the land that
may be thus claimed, it will be necessary for you to lay down on the
township plats the claims of this discription, So far as it can be done
from the information filed with the Commissioners, or that obtained
from other Sources, with the view of withholding the lands from Sale
until there be a judicial decision, or the claimants shall have failed
to avail themselves of the provisions of this Act.
With great respect &c G. G.

CANTO: KING 6th June 1828
SIR A post office having been established lately, at the Seminole
Indian Agency, it is the nearest point to Canto: Brooke, and to which,
all letters intended for that post, should be addressed, and should be
so noted, on, the Register.
In writing to you, relative to the recruiting service the other day,
I ought; to have said, that it is not my wish, to go on the recruiting
service, this year, in any event, but, should wish very much to be
detailed, next spring, or fall, for the New York Station, as M” Brooke
and her family, will remain at the north, until, that period.
Whilst writing, it becomes my duty, to to mention, a circumstance,
very injurious to the public service, both in a military point of view,
& the value of the public lands, in the neighborhood of Tampa Bay.
Several persons, have settled near Canto: Brooke, who are in the
habit of selling whiskey, to the soldiers & Indians, and cutting wood.
It is out of my power to prevent it, there being no court, nearer,
than St Augustine, and to exercise force, would subject myself, & the
army, to the abuse of every newspaper, in the Union, and perhaps,
induce the Secretary at War, to suppose, that, an improper exercise
of authority, had been used. I wish therefore that, I could be em-
powered, by the proper Dept, to remove such of those persons, who
are, in the habit, of committing the offences, complained of. An early
attention to this, matter, would be beneficial, to the U. States."

WASHINGTON June 15* 1828
SIR, I had a conversation yesterday with the Atto General, & he
concurs in opinion with me about the two sections of the Act of which
we were conversing"—I called at your office to see your instruc-
tions *—found that you had not directed the Register & Receiver, to
authorize the selection of a smaller for a larger quantity, to wit, 19
arpans for 640 which the claimant of No 10 is anxious to do—both
are within the plats and the grants, the major may include the minor,
but if a claimant will take less than is offered him it will be within
the spirit of the law. I take leave also most respectfully to suggest

directed in the Act of Congress—I understand that the Deputy
informed Col Searcy the draftsman, that an Island owned by me,
had increased lately, & the same Deputy wrote to my agent that he
did not survey it because he had no one to shew it to him—It seems
that he could not find it, and yet knew it had increased in size—
This Island was granted as an Island “Pocomas, O menus” more or less
and has not increased—It never was surveyed but a plat made which
has been furnished, & was granted to a Spanish officer for his public
services as Containing 800 arpans more or less—It probably contains
double the quantity, & did when it was granted—It is difficult to be
surveyed, but that is no reason for its postponement—When the law
directs a public officer to do an act, & he is also instructed to by the
Head of his Department, & fails, I know the the legal remedy, but
I have no desire to resort to it, if the surveyor or his Deputies do
not neglect it intentionally—I have as yet no other reason than the
fact above to suppose that the excuse of the Deputy was a good one,
& request that he be again instructed to make the survey, & if I am
informed when they are there, or my agent we will send to shew him
that Island, the enlargement of which only he has discovered.

GEORGE GRAHAM TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 21]
18th June 1828.
THE PRESIDENT.
SIR, The Act passed on the 23" of May last " entitled—“an Act
supplementary to the several acts providing for the settlement and
confirmation of private Land claims in Florida” having authorized the
claimants to Lands not confirmed to file petitions in the District Courts
of Florida for the adjudication of their claims “according to the forms,
rules, regulations, conditions, restrictions and limitations prescribed to
the District Judges and claimants in the State of Missouri and Terri-
tory of Arkansas to institute proceedings to try the validity of their
claims”—and as claims to the value of several millions of dollars will
thus be brought before the District Courts of Florida for decision, it
behooves the United States, therefore, to take all due measures for
the thorough investigation of these claims, and to take care that all
the Laws and regulations of the Spanish Government relative to the
disposition of the public domains in the several colonies be fully pre-
sented to the Court. To do this it will be essentially necessary to have
a person employed who is well acquainted with the Spanish language,
and who has made an opportunity of becoming conversant with the
Laws of Spain relative to the disposition of Lands in the Colonies.
Mr White, the present delegate from Florida having been one of the
Commissioners for deciding on the private claims in West Florida, the
report made by which commission is one of the best and most satis-
factory that has at any time been made on the subject of Spanish and
British claims, and having acquired a competent knowledge of the
Spanish language, and made himself well acquainted with the Laws
of Spain in relation to the disposition of her Lands, I take the liberty
of suggesting the expediency of employing him as assistant Counsel
under the provision of the 11" Section of the Act above referred to—
Should Mr White be thus employed, and should the Attorney Gen.'
deem it expedient to have the aid of a person conversant with the lan-
guage and Laws of Spain in preparing the cases on which appeals have
been taken from Missouri and Arkansaw there would appear to be a
peculiar propriety in employing Mr White to aid the Attorney Gen' in
preparing these cases as the decision on many of the cases in Florida
will essentially depend on the principles which may be established by
774 STAT. 284–286. Section 6 of the act is quoted; section 7 provided that claim-
ants could take appeals to the Supreme Court within four months after the decision
of the district courts, whose judges were to be entitled to extra compensation for
performing duties under the act.

HON. MR WHITE of Florida, now at New York.
SIR, I have in a conversation with the President expressed an opinion
of the necessity and propriety of employing some person well ac-
quainted not only with the Spanish language but with the Spanish
laws relative to the disposition of the public domain in the Spanish
colonies as assistant Counsel under the provisions of the 11" Section
of the Act passed the 23" of May last, and at the same time suggested
your name as a person well acquainted both with the Spanish language
and laws, and regulations relative to the disposition of the public
domain. The President acquiesced in the propriety of employing such
assistant counsel, and expressed his opinion in favor of employing you,
provided there was no objection arising out of your situation as a
delegate, and he was not aware that there were any such, and provided
also an arrangement could be made with you as to the compensation.”
He seemed also to think that it would be advisable to extend your
employment to the aid of Mr Wirt in preparing the cases from Missouri
for trial at the next term of the Supreme Court. On this latter subject
I will see Mr Wirt and ascertain his views. I think however that you
had better address a letter to me stating the terms on which you would
act as assistant counsel, and those for which you would undertake to
aid Mr Wirt in the Missouri cases to be tried at the next term of the
Supreme Court.

that I should be engaged in the defence of the suits now depending, &
those which may be instituted, against the United States—
I have devoted three or four years to the subject of the organization
of the Spanish Tribunals, the powers of the Provincial officers, & the
history, changes, & modifications of the local ordinances of the
Spanish Government, in relation to the disposition of the Royal
domaine—In addition to this, I have procured several collections of
Spanish law, and numerous copies, of written orders Commissions, &
official letters, prescribing the duties, & limiting the authority of the
local officers, at my own expence, and at great trouble—When I
filled was in the office of Commissioner, I remained in the country
three years in the laborious discharge of its duties, & exposed my self
to the resentment, persecution, & indeed hazards of assasination
(which was once attempted). of those who had claims which we were
compelled to reject—Our report was approved with a commendation
never bestowed on any other by Congress”—of All the Boards of
Commissioners that were ever organized before, there was no report
against British grants within the former Province of West Florida, &
valuable lands in Louisiana, Missisippi, & Alabama have been
confirmed to the amount of more than two millions of acres—Since
our Report Congress have not confirmed any more, either in those
states or in Florida—It may confidently be asserted that our report
on that class of claims has saved more than one million of acres to the
goverement, of the most valuable lands—I mention this to shew that
the U States have no claim upon me without paying me an adequate &
liberal consideration & that I have by the opinions I have pronounced
deprived my self of the opportunity of appearing as Counsel in
numerous cases. As soon as our office was closed and before our reports
were published, The British claimants offered to employ me in all
their cases, & two percent on the amount would have been a handsome
fortune. You state that the President wishes to know what Compensa-
tion I will ask. This must of course depend on the number and nature
of the cases, in which I may be retained—There is now in the supreme
court a case from Mississippi involving a question of the validity of a
British grant which may incidentaly affect the U States to the amount
of more than a million of acres, although the contest is between two
individuals. The principle to be settled is a most important one.
I am willing to appear and argue, or assist in prepareing arguments
against the British claim, or claims for $500—There is a question also
involving all the grants in the country between the Mississippi &
Perdido made by the Spanish authorities subsequent to the time at

which we claim that it was ceded. I was applied to to appear against
the pretentions of the U States, with M Webster, but they did not
pay the fee, the case was not called, & I would prefer to appear for
the U. States. for this I would require $500—This is also a contest
between individuals, but the decission will affect the U Stats by
settling a class of claims of more than a million and a half of acres.
The claims of Missouri and Arkansas now depending, or which
may be brought to the Supreme Court refer to the same questions
that were before our Board, & if the President supposes that my aid
would promote the public interests, I am willing to assist the Atto
General for $500 in the principal case, & one or two hundred in each
of the other cases that are now depending or which may be brought
to the supreme Court—I am not yet employed in a singgle case in
Florida, & am willing to be engaged to oppose such claims as were
reported against by us, and to indicate by law, & documents in my
possession, the opinions I delivered in my official character—Propo-
sitions have been made to me by the claimants in two cases which if
complied with, I shall act as assistant counsel for them—The principle
on which they must be decided is different from any other, & will not
conflict with any doctrine laid down in the Reports—The one is a
grant of indemnity for losses, the other a question purely of national
law. I would not be willing to engage to argue against all the claims
in Florida, but to assist the District atto in such as I consider illegal
& vicious—In these I would appear on the same terms as the Missouri
cases—As my duties at Washington would require me to be some-
times absent I would only engage to superintend the pleadings, &
direct the manner of proceding to present the points on which the
supreme Court could give a proper opinion—In the settlement of a
few leading principles, to be extracted from the most obscure system
of jurispudence to be found in the history of any Country, in a
foreign language, & in many instances depending on Commissions, &
official letters never printed a quantity of not less than six millions
of acres of land depend. The sums which I have charged would not be
one fourth of a per cent upon the amount, & not one per cent on what
will actually be saved to the governent if the questions are fairly
presented—I am not willing to appear in any, unless I am retained
in all of those mentioned above, & particularly in the British grants
& those of Missouri & Arkansas—As to the Florida cases I should like
to reserve to my self the right of appearing for such of them, as I
find have claims not conflicting with any principle which may come
up in the others; & such as are of undoubted validity. I shall be
pleased to be informed of the views of the President as to the Com-
pensation, within a few days, as my future course will be governed

SIR I have the honor to submit for your information, the Copy
of a Letter addressed by me to the Hon: M White,” together with
his answer"—I had not an opportunity of seeing M" Wirt before he
left the City for Annapolis, and I presume that no decisive opinion
can be given on the propriety of employing M" White in the cases
now before the Supreme Court, without previously advising with
Mr Wirt—As to the employment of M" White as assistant Counsel
under the provision of the 11." Section of the act approved the 23"
of May last,” & in particular as to the extent of duties that may be
required of him, & the compensation for the same, I presume that it
will be equally expedient to consult with the Attorney Genl: who will
I believe be here in a few days—Alth” it is by no means the intention
of the Law or the wish of the Executive to interpose obstructions to
the final decision in favor of every Claim fully sanctioned by the Laws
& regulations of the Spanish Government, yet the limitation to his
services as proposed by M. White may produce some embarrassment
as to his employment.
I have therefore in acknowledging M" White's Letter, only stated
that it has been submitted to you, & cannot probably be acted upon

in which they occur, and before proceeding to the removal of them,
you will report to the Department all the information you can obtain
respecting their nature and extent, and probable effect of their re-
moval on the navigation of the river above, and, you will also furnish
Estimates as near as may be of the Cost of removing them, and the
mode you propose to adopt for that purpose, you are also instructed
to make a survey of the river & Harbour of S" Marks, for which pur-
pose an appropriation of $500 was made at the late session of Con-
gress"—
The object of the survey being to ascertain the practicability &
expense of removing the obstructions to the navigation it is necessary
that the report & map should exhibit fully the nature & extent of
those obstructions, together with accurate measurements of the width
and depth of the channel in the whole length of the part surveyed—

Congress having extended the period for adjudicating private

however Communicate with the Register & Receiver at your request,
and apprise you of what I may Ultimately determine upon.
My Deputy Surveyors have just arrived from the West, have been
driven out of the Country by the extreme heat of the weather. The
claimants have not in one Single instance availed themselves of this
opportunity to have their claims run out, although notified through
the paper at Pensacola; and the deputies remaining at that City four
days under very heavy expences. I am apprehensive that large
portions of those claims are So poor as to induce the Owners to
permit their Survey and Sale with a hope of future indemnity by the
United States, this opinion however is wholly my own without any
information on the Subject from others.
I forwarded my Bond to Judge Randall for his Certificate a few
days Since and which he returned in Consequence of a Small informal-

has been executed and forwarded this day to Judge Randall, who will

has not been directed to the exclusion of this work. If the map is not
engraved, & the Report printed, before the meeting of Congress one
year more will be lost. It has not been my habit to complain, or to
encourage an idea that the South is neglected—I have never believed
that such was the intention of any part of the govement—I feel exceed-
ingly anxious to have that report presented—The reports which have
been unofficially made has caused the subject gradually to fade from
the public mind—You will perceive from the paper I enclose that here

several reasons for the delay—The fund of $20,000 cannot be expended
unless it has been diverted to other objects, & if so, it is but reasonable
to claim that the map & Report be engraved & printed out of the other

I ask the favor of you to read a letter I had the honor to address to

1 See ante, vol. XXIII, 786, n. The Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser,
Feb. 15, 1828, printed an article by White dated Jan. 19, 1828, discussing the
practicability of the canal. Maj. Perrault's report of Feb. 1, 1828 (see ante,
vol. XXIII, 855, n.), was transmitted to Gen. Bernard, who in the same month
began to compile his own more detailed account (Bernard to the Chief Engineer,
Feb. 11, 1828, NA, WD, CE. Lets. Recd., B428). On the suggestion of Bernard
(Feb. 19, 1828, letter not found) the Chief Engineer, Feb. 20, 1828 (loc. cit., Lets.
to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 3), authorized Perrault to prepare a general map of the
proposed canal.
2 Answered July 14, 1828 (NA, WD, CE Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 5), that the
report and maps were in a state of forwardness. White proposed, Dec. 6, 1828
(loc. cit., Reg. of Lets. Recd., No. 2, W 326; text missing), the immediate engrav-
ing of the canal survey, but was informed by the Chief Engineer that there were
no funds for the purpose (Dec. 16, 1828, loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 5; printed,
Pensacola Gazette and Fla. Advertiser, Feb. 24, 1829). Gen. Bernard and Capt.
William T. Poussin, Feb. 19, 1829, signed the original “Report of the Board of
Internal Improvement on the Contemplated Canal between the Atlantic and
the Gulf of Mexico,” which with a draft copy is in NA (WD, CE, Case and Drawer
Bulky File No. 72). Copies of the report are loc. cit., Corps of Engrs. Repts., and
loc. cit., TB, Repts. of Bd. Inter. Improvts. It is printed in H. Exec. Doc. 147,
20 Cong., 2 sess., S. Doc. 102, 20 Cong., 2 sess., and H. Doc. 185, 22 Cong., 1 sess.
Sections of the report are headed: Topographical and Hydrographical Descrip-

of the Several Routes of a Canal Across the Peninsula of Florida, Inland Naviga-
tion along the Coast from Tampa Bay to the Head of the Delta of the Mississippi,
Improvements through the Delta of the Mississippi, and Summary. The fact
that the Wacissa river did not appear on the map was stated by John G. Gamble,
Jan. 9, 1830, who believed that a connection with St. Marks river would make it
part of the canal. His letter was transmitted by Del. White to Gen. Bernard,

The condition of the Florida Indians is such as to its very wretched-
ness, besides the annoyance which they occasion to the Citizens of
Florida, and which is consequent upon their poverty and want, as to
make it extremely desirable to relieve both; and nothing prevents
the steps being taken, at this time, which you suggest, but the in-
adequacy of the means provided by Congress for such objects, and
which will it is feared, be scarcely Sufficient to pay the cost of the

had not reached him. He intends to embark at this Port for Key West.
When he gets here, I Will enter into the Necessary Bonds, and take
the Oath of Office, of which you Shall be notified. So Soon as I arrive
at Key West, I will Commence taking the Census,” agreeably to
your instructions, and forward them on in time for the Meeting
of the Senate.
Permit me Sir, to request the favor of you to have forwarded on
to Key West, as Soon as may be Convenient, a Sett of the Laws
of the United States, as those that were in my office, have been
delivered over to Adam Gordon Esq" the present Marshal. It Will be
of the highest importance to have them, as I presume Nothing of the
Kind Can be found on the Island. It has been Suggested to me, that
the most Convenient and expeditious plan Would be to Send them
to the Havana, to the Care of the American Consul, who Will have
almost daily opportunities to forward them to me at Key West.
There is another Subject to which I beg leave to Call your attention.
I am informed that it is the intention of the Navy Department to
Sell all the Public Property at Key West. Would it not be better to
reserve one of the Buidlings for a Court House. I am told that the
Hospital is the best Calculated for that purpose. I do myself the
Honor to Write by this Mail to the Secretary of the Treasury giving
him also my Views on the Subject. If you can make this arrangement,
I think it will be a great Saving to the Government, and Convenience
to the Court, as Houses must be Scarce and Very expensive.”
Please accept for your self my grateful acknowledgements, for this
further Proof of your friendly patronage, and assure the President
of my everlasting gratitutde, and best Wishes for the Health and
happiness of you both.—
I have the Honor to be, With the highest Consideration your most
obedient and Very obliged humble Servant,

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
17" Ulto"—with the enclosed extract of a letter from the Hon" M*
White, on the Subject of the duties appertaining to this Office.—I have
also received a letter from M* White on the Subject of Some private
Claims in West Florida.”
The accompanying documents N° 1.2 & 3 will apprise you of the
Steps taken to have the private claims Surveyed, and under your
letter of instructions of date the 18" August 1827,” I feel justified in
Saying that all has been done by this department that Can be required
of it—If the Surveys which have been executed are to remain open for
additional Surveys they Cannot be Completed until the ensuing year,
and will tend to accumulate difficulty on difficulty in this Office. On
this Subject I must await your instructions—enclosed you will find my
answer to M.” White, Subject to your perusal, and I must ask the
favour to have it Sealed, and forwarded to his address—I would
barely remark that the Deputy Surveyor alluded to by Col° White
was in his Company at Pensacola, on Several occasions during his
Stay there under my instructions, and that Col." White gave him as
a reason for not going with him to Shew his lands, the delicate health
of his Lady, yet why did not the Col" Send Some person or why did his
Agent Subsequently fail to attend to Col° Whites business.
I trust Sir, that you will have no other than a just regard for the
fulfilment of the laws in this matter, and that my Deputy Surveyor
and myself will not be held Subject to the will of any person who may
choose to Call for Surveys when their liesure and inclination prompts
them.
I have the honor to be very respectfully Yr Ob Sert

Owing to the Country South & East being So much inundated with
the late rains as to render Surveying impracticable in that quarter at
this time; you will proceed west, and take up all unfinished work above
the parallel except, where it may interfere with Forbes” and Inner-
arity" large Claims Completing the Same as far as practicable under
Your General instructions
You will be furnished with a list of private Claims which have been
Sanctioned and yet remained to be Surveyed—Your attention is
particularly Called to the Completion thereof So far as you Can
identify them.
Should there not be found a Sufficient quantity of Surveying to
Complete Your Contracts or the Season too far advanced before you
Complete, You are Authorised to desist work provided you deem it
hazardous to Continue the Same;—in the former event you will have
assigned you Sufficient work to Complete Your Contract So Soon as
the fall Season Sets in, to enable you again to take the field, you will
also take up any unfinished work South of the parallel and west of
Choctawhatchee.
It is extremely desirable that your visit to the West, may Supercede

You also instructed me to be and attend in the Town of Pensacola,
from the 5"Until the 10" of August, for the purpose of receiving from the
different claimants Such information as might be necessary to enable
me to find the diferent tracts of land &C Sir, in Compliance of which
I arrived at the Town of Pensacola either on the 3rd or 4" of August,
and remained there until the 12" or 13" of Said month, without being
able to obtain but little information of advantage to me, from the
claimants, Some of them appeared to be willing to afford any infor-
mation, others were indifferent, and Some were not to be Seen.
I proceeded to the woods on the east Side of the Escambia Bay, near
the head of the Same, above the basis parallel, and Commenced work
about the 27 or 28" of August, my Young Men with me were taken
Sick, in Consequence of which together with the death of my Son,
and one other young man in my employ I was under the necessity of
leaving the Country for a few weeks for Steeer-ahd-fer Safety—I re-
turned again early in November and took up my work, I went again
to Pensacola, about the 22nd November for the purpose of Seeing
Some of the Claimants to induce them, to Send Some person or Come
themselves and Shew me their lands, Some did So, and had their
lands Surveyed, others would not Come, all of which I Surveyed,
that I could by any means find, and Some with the utmost difficulty—
In relation to the Island in the Escambia river, I was at no time able
to procure any person to Shew me the land, Co." White told me that
a Mr Williams would be with me for the purpose of Shewing me Some-
thing about it, but he failed to do so & as I was informed there are
many Slues that run, through the Islands, which makes it difficult
for a Stranger to make any particular designation.—There was a
package of papers Sent to me, being directed to Ja" R. Donelson [o]r
myself, Said to belong to Co." White, with a letter of instructions, but
of no Service to me, without a pilot, the letter I believe I left with
A. Gordon Esqr of Pensacola, and the other papers, sent back to the
Post Office I believe, from which they Came—with much difficulty
I assure you that it was that I got to Survey as many private claims
as I did, I believed it to be my duty to Survey all I Could find, and
was at the trouble and expence of obtaining from the Keeper of the
Public Archives a list of all the Claims that he Knew any thing about,
in the Section of Country I was directed to work in, but for want of
the necessary information I have no doubt there are a few yet un-
surveyed, but if the necessary information Can be obtained I am

SIR, Last winter I had the honor to Submit to your predecessor

were approved by him—but at that time no appropriation had been
made for the removal of Such Indians as might be willing to emigrate
to the country assigned to them west of the Mississippi-

Gov: Barbour assured me if the appropriation was made by Con-
gress," he would do all in his power to promote the emigration of the
Indians in this quarter—I was then as I now am, particularly desirous
Co.' Thos. L. M*Kenny should visit the Indians in this Territory.
His knowledge of the Indian Character, habits and Manners, better
qualify him for effecting the views of the Gov" in relation to these
unfortunate people than any other man I have ever known; and your
predecessor Said that if he could possibly dispense with his Services
he should be Sent to Florida—
I am aware Sir, that M Barbour by some was censured for sending
M" M*Kenney last Summer on a visit to several Indian Nations,"
but the Services he rendered to the United States, were certainly
highly valuable; and when the violence of party Shall Subside the
foresight of Mr Barbour & the Services of M" M*Kenny will be
acknowledged by all, who understands the interest, and appreciates
the honor of the country.
Beleiving that he will do much more by his presence among the
Indians than he can possibly effect for the country in his office for a
few months to come, I request you will (if his Services can be with-
drawn from his Office) permit him to visit Florida—Nothing Short
of the conviction that his influence with the Chiefs of the Indian
Tribes in this Country, will be equal to effecting the objects of your
Department, would induce me to make this request
Convinced that the happiness and prosperity of this Territory must
be greatly promoted by the removal of the Indians, and that by such
removal humanity will be consulted and the remnant of these Tribes
Saved from distruction.

SIR, The change which has recently taken place in the Minister of
War," has, it is feared delayed the execution of a plan which I had
the honor to lay before the late Secretary Gov: Barbour for the
removal of the Florida Indians.” I had urged to Gov: Barbour the
importance of your visiting this country to effect this desirable object,
and, understood from him if the appropriation passed Congress
sufficient to commence giving effect to the plans of the Gov" in con-
centrating the Indians, he would if your services could be spared
send you to Florida—I yet hope his successor will consent that you
shall visit Florida, as I am convinced you would have great influence
with the Chiefs of the Siminole Nation—
I have written to the Secretary of War urging that you may be
sent to this quarter,” and I hope he will accede to the request—If the
business of your Office should prevent your absence from the City
I request I may be authorised to send a party of Indians to visit the
Country designed for them, and that the Sub Agent Maj. John
Phagan may have the conduct of the Party, a more careful and
vigilent and valuable Officer is not to be found any where. I can
depend on his decision, prudence & Integrity of character This Officer
and one individual I can select to assist him, or in case of his illness
or death to lead the party will be all that is necessary—
My plan is to take one respectable Indian from each Town, not
permitting the whole party to exceed twenty five—That they shall
be furnished each, with a horse bridle Saddle rifle two blankets & a
Kettle and such necessaries as will be required—what portion of the
fund appropriated for the emigrant Indians will be assigned to this
Superintendency to meet the expense of the emigrating party is for
the Secretary to determine. I desire to be at liberty to exercise my
discression in arranging this party except in the essential article of
expence—I do not confidently state that I shall succeed fully in
meeting the wishes of the Gov" but I will omit nothing on my part
that will give satisfaction to the emigrants or the Department.—
It may be necessary for me to visit the Indians at the Agency,
and on the Appalachicola River, and to converse with the Chiefs—
Should the Dept not be able to spare you I must request if I am
authorised to act in this business you will send to me such a talk as

TALLAHASSEE July 24" 1828.
TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR. The communication of the Engineer Department of the 30"
Ultimo has been received.” I shall proceed agreeably to your instruc-
tions to make the examination of the Appalachicola River and report
to the department the nature and extent of the obstructions to the
navigation of said river and the effect of removing them, and shall
immediately thereafter furnish an estimate of the expense, and the
mode I propose to adopt for that purpose. In the mean time I now
offer to the department such information as I possess, founded upon
a previous cursory reconnoissance. The obstructions above alluded
to consist principally in deposites of quantities of drift wood and large
trees with their roots in such portions of the river as are tortuous and
winding. It will be necessary to make use of flats or scows with
Spanish windlasses to remove them, after they have been cut or sawed
under the water. As the water in this river is low in the fall of the
year, the sooner preparations for the work are commenced the better.
I will therefore immediately after the examination cause two flats
between 50 & 60 feet long with Spanish windlasses to be built at or
near the junction of the Flint and Chattahouchie Rivers, in order to
commence operations whenever the water is low enough, and when
I shall have been furnished with the requisite funds for one month’s
wages and provisions of the hands to be employed for in the service
and the contingencies for building the flats, and purchase of axes,
chairs, cables ropes &ca &ca. It will require 20 able bodied hands,
experienced axemen and boatmen for the period of three months to
remove the obstructions to the navigation of the Appalachicola River
as effectively as is contemplated by the Act of Congress.” The follow-
ing is a rough estimate of the expense & provisions of 20 hands for one
month, together with an estimate for building the flats and purchase
of chains, cables, axes &ac &ac
20 hands at $1. per day for 30 days $600.00.
Provisions & whiskey for same, for 30 days @ 50/100 300.00.
2 Flats @ $75 each is $150, cables, chains, windlasses axes,
grindstone (all to be sold after work is completed for US) 300.00
Total for first month $1200.00
After the above examination and commencement of preparations
are finished. I shall proceed to survey the river and Harbor of St

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:GLO, PLC, Incoming Corr.:LS*]
Office of the Attorney General of the U. States
No 2. July 26 1828.
SIR, I have read the correspondence between M* Graham, the Com-
missioner of the Gen' Land Office, and Colo. White,” relative to the
employment of assistant counsel to the District Attorneys of Florida
in defending the interests of the U.S. against the claimants of Spanish
grants in that Territory. I collect from the correspondence that
those claims are to a very great amount and that they rest in a great
degree on Spanish ordinancies, decrees, orders &" many of which have
never yet been published and are not to be found but by accident in
private and different hands. It is manifest that the success of the
United States in the Supreme Court must depend on the proper prep-
aration of these cases in the courts below, the Supreme Court being
limited on appeal to the case as it stands on the record. And it is
equally manifest that these cases cannot be properly prepared in the
Courts below except by Counsel who are masters of the whole law
on the subject. M Whites service as a Commissioner for the settle-
ment of these claims and the experience derived from this service,
and the circumstance which he states of his possession of many of
those obscure and unpublished orders, decrees, letters &" on which
the power of the subordinate officers of the Spanish Crown to make
the grants in question do materially depends would certainly point
him out as the person who ought to be retained, if his services can be
commanded, for a liberal compensation. I would advise that Colo
White be generally retained as assistant Counsel to the District
Attorney in Florida: that he received a liberal retaining fee and such
other fee for the argument of each case as you may think reasonable;
with a special understanding that it be considered part of his duty to
see that the each case is properly prepared before it be submitted to
the Court for it's decision. I do not think that Colo. White, on
farther reflection, will insist on being left at liberty to take cases also
against the Government; and to make his own selection of the cases
in which he will appear on the one side or the other; because of the
extreme delicacy of such a situation and the misconstruction to which
he will expose himself, let his conduct be ever so pure. Indeed I do
not think that the government could with any propriety enter into

such an engagement with any gentleman, if they can find a competent
assistant on whom they may rely in every case.
I beg leave to suggest that it will be very important to have a com-
plete collection of all the Spanish & French ordinances &" affecting
the land titles in Florida and the other Western territories and States
formerly belonging to the Crowns of Spain and France at different
times. Such a collection will be indispensible to a just decision of
these claims by the Supreme Court. If Colo. White could be induced
to compile such a collection, with an accurate index, it would be of
inestimable value in these controversies: and the expense of printing
a full edition would be well bestowed by the Government. Such a
work seems to me to be most imperiously called for by all the Courts
and all the Counsel who will have to act upon this interesting subject;
and the value of the subject at stake as well as the activity with which
these claims will be urged against the U.S. require that no time should
be lost in making the collection. Such a work would be of infinitely
more value than the assistance of any counsel that could be com-
manded in the mere argument of the causes.
With regard to the cases which Colo White mentions as depending
in the Supreme Court, between individuals, but in which the U. S.
are concerned I know nothing of these. He does not give the names,
and my docket gives me no information of such cases. I cannot
therefore judge of the necessity of calling in assistant Counsel to the
Attorney General. I can only say in general, that it will always be
agreeable to me to have assistance in the public causes in the Supreme
Court whenever the Pres' shall think proper to give it: In a cause
depending on the local laws of Spain in her former provinces, laws
and ordinances and orders, depending, often, on mere letters and
which have never been published, such assistance would be indis-
pensable unless I could be put in possession of the laws themselves.

however very desirous to employ you as assistant counsel under the

COL. ROB" BUTLER Surveyor Tallahassee.
SIR, Your letter of the 15" ult” covering one to Mr White has
been received," I am not certain as to Mr. White's present direction,
I have however sent the letter under cover to the Post Master at
New York with directions that if he does not call for it in all this
month that it be returned to this Office.
I very much regret the delays which have occurred in laying down
the private claims in West Florida which you state to have arisen from
the defects in describing the claims, so that the Surveyors are unable
to locate & survey them from the information derived from the
abstracts of decisions, & from the neglect of the claimants to come
forward and give the necessary information by which they may be
ascertained and surveyed.
Before the lands are subdivided for sale, I wish another effort to
be made this autumn to survey all the private claims confirmed, and it
would be advisable to give early & due notice in the Paper published in
Pensacola, of the time that your deputies will attend there for the
purpose: this notice should be accompanied with a list of all the
claims, the description of which is so defective that they cannot be
located and surveyed from the information derived from the public
archives, and the claimants informed that if they do not attend or
furnish the necessary information that the Lands will be surveyed as
public land, without respect to such claims—and the lands should be

he takes a lively interest in the object of sett'ling the Indians of

Lands, by taking therefrom the Live Oak & other valuable Timber,
I am requested by the Secy of the Treasury to call your attention to
the Instructions heretofore given on this subject.”
It is beleived that a large portion of such depredations are com-
mitted
1st by persons under the cover of Contracts with the claimants
of Spanish grants, dated subsequent to the period limited in the Treaty.
2nd. Under cover of contracts with the claimants of Lands whose
claims have been regularly filed but not confirmed by Congress.
3rd. Under cover of contracts with claimants whose claims have
been confirmed either as valid under the treaty, or as donations, but
which claims are attempted to be located on Lands not covered by the
original grant or donation, for the double purpose of obtaining better
lands, and disposing of the valuable live oak Timber.—
It is understood that the Courts in Florida have refused to sustain
actions for trespass brought by the U States against persons who affect
to claim under a Spanish concession, or under a donation from the
United States.
It is not beleived that this refusal of the Courts can extend to the
cases coming under the 1st or 3" Classes above mentioned.
The claims of the 1st Class are declared by the Treaty to be invalid
and the question which arises in relation to those of the 3" Class is not
a question as to validity of title, but one of mere location to be de-
cided on record or oral testimony as the case may be. It is therefore
the wish of the Secretary of the Treasury that in cases coming under
the 1 & 3" Class above referred to, where from the representations of
the Agent of the Navy Dept. or from other information, you have
cause to beleive that trespasses have been committed on the public
Lands you will institute suit against the trespassers
With respect to the 2" Class of Cases, the Courts may probably
entertain doubts of the propriety of sustaining actions of trespass so
far as the validity of title might be involved in the decision; but it is
presumable, that on the representation of the Agent for the Navy, that
the claimants in these cases were cutting down & taking off valuable
live oak Timber essential for the use of the Navy, the Courts would
grant injunctions to stay Waste, until the validity of title was decided,
and if they should refuse to do this, it is possible that they might be
induced to lay an injunction on the purchaser prohibiting the payment
of the purchase money until the title to the Land was decided, this
latter course if it can be effected in any way, would more probably

arrest the depredations on the public lands and the destruction of the
Live oak timber than any other that could be devised.—
Should the Courts however oppose themselves to either of the
modes above referred to by which the Live Oak Timber may be pre-
served for the Gov" you will then have recourse to the provisions of the
Act of the last Session of Congress providing for the settlement & con-
firmation of Private Land Claims in Florida, and whenever a claimant
shall avail himself of the provisions of the 6th Section of that Act,”
you will apply for an injunction to stay Waste, provided you are ad-

source that the Lands afford valuable Live Oak timber, lying within

the Report of the Att" General on the subject of the land claims in
Florida—If I were to consult my individual interests I should decline
any offer on the part of the U. States-Having acted, however in the
Office of a Commissioner under the Florida Treaty, there are a num-
ber of claims reported by me as a constituent member of the Board
in West Florida as invalid and fraudulent, that I never could advocate
consistently with delicacy and propriety—I feel highly flattered by
the desire the President has been pleased to express to engage me as
assistant counsel, as it Evinces his confidence, and approbation of
the Report made by the Commissioners—I acknowledge the force
of the reasoning of the Att’ General and the propriety of the Condi-
tion annexed by the President to my employment—I have promised
only to assist in the argument of two claims against the government,
those of John Forbes & Co & Arredondo—The first depends on an
Indian Sale and a decree of approbation by the Provincial Governor—
The other was a contract to bring settlers on a tract of land designated,
within a certain time which was not done before the Treaty and
transfer, and the question to be decided is how far the transfer to the
U. States absolves the grantees from the performance.—These two

claims are anomalous—There are none of the same kind in Florida—
They depend on principles so entirely different from all the rest that
one might argue them without the delicate relations suggested by
the Att, General—If the proposition to be retained had been made
before I engaged to assist in the argument of these two claims I
should not have agreed to any proposition—The question about the
title of the Indians with or without the Consent of the Spanish
Government and a contract pending when the province of one Sov-
ereign is transfered to another government, and the principles of
National law applicable to it, cannot relate remotely to the powers
of provincial officers, the composition of local Tribunals, the formali-
ties of Spanish grants, the performance of conditions, the official
letters on which concessions absolute and conditional were made—
These last are those which the Att’ General says it is indispensible
to have, in the preperation of the cases below and for his government
in the Supreme Court, —I am willing to undertake 1* to collect and
furnish you with a reference to all the decrees, official letters com-
missions and instructions, laws and ordinances relating to the con-
cessions of lands in Florida so far as I can, Copies of which can be sent
to the District Attorneys for their information and government.
2" I will agree to furnish the Att’ General with a reference to all
the laws and ordinances organizing Spanish Tribunals with those I
obtained from Cuba and from Spain, which will assist him in the
defence of the suits now depending in the Supreme Court from
Missouri and Arkansas as well as those to be instituted under the
act of the last session in Florida.
3" I will engage to defend any suit against the U States instituted
upon any title pronounced by the Board of which I was a member
fraudulent, to furnish the evidence I have in relation to it, and to
argue it in the Court below and in the Supreme Court if desired by
the Atty General.
4* I will engage to assist in resisting the British claims in Florida
in the Court below or in the Supreme Court.
It is known to you and the President that in the Treaty between
England and Spain in 1783, it was stipulated that the British pro-
prietors should sell out their possessions within a limited time," and
if their value was such that it could not be done, a longer period
should be allowed—as the Commissioners were not apprized of any
proclamation of extension and forfeiture, they recommended the

confirmation of all British grants in Louisiana, Mississippi and Ala-
bama not subsequently granted by Spain for confirmation and they
have been confirmed. I ascertained that after the time limited in
the treaty had expired the Spanish authorities allowed a longer
period, and finally after several extensions, a formal decree of forfei-
ture was made.—This decree I obtained with great difficulty, and
now have it. This document alone has saved a million of acres of
land to the U. States, The fact of its existence is stated in our
Report and no British title has been confirmed in Florida. Our Re-
port is satisfactory to Congress but if the question is agitated in
Court, the production of the authenticated document will be required.
I mention this as a single case to shew the magnitude of the interests
of the government and the difficulty of the Subject.—If the President
thinks the information I have collected in three years of laborious
examination may be useful to the government I am willing to stipu-
late to receive the sum you mention for a retaining fee not to appear
in any other cases than the two mentioned against the U. States and
to perform the services stipulated above as well as I can. $1500 to
be paid now & 1500 when I furnish the Att" General with a reference
to the ordinances—To stipulate not to appear in thirty cases in which
I should certainly be employed beside the fraudulent claims refered
to and to perform a service that no other can, since the death of my
colleague," I think must be considered by the President a reasonable
compensation. I cannot undertake it for less. It might be demon-
strated that this sum would be but a small commission on what has
already been saved by my exertions to say nothing of the labor, vex-
ation, confinement and persecution, consequent on my arduous
services for three years in that office—No sum would be an adequate
compensation for the vexation and calumnies I experienced for the
honest discharge of my duty."

proposed in this answer. He informed me that it was his intention
to leave Boston, upon his return to Florida this morning and he will
probably reach Washington as soon as this letter.
You will make the necessary arrangements with him for collecting
the decrees. Laws and Ordinances and other Official Documents
relating to the grants of land in Florida under the Spanish & British
Governments and those that are in the Spanish language translations
must be made. If M Trist" has a competent knowledge of the
Spanish I wish you to engage him to make the compilation and
translation of these ordinances and Documents to be published. I
hope the attorney General will be at Washington when Mr White
passes through and that they may confer together with regard to the

will issue the requisition to the Treasury for the payment now to be

[NA:WD, CE. Lets. Recd., M.464:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE Aug 18" 1828.
TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE UNITED STATES
SIR. Agreably to my instructions,” I proceeded to make an
examination of the river Appalachicola, & the obstructions to the
navigation to said river, and have the honor to make the following
report of their nature and extent and the effect that their removal
will have upon the navigation above. I commenced my examination
at the junction of the Flint and Chattahouchie rivers and descended
in a boat with 4 men to the Appalachicola Bay, keeping the
channel usually navigated by steamboats and other craft and ascer-
taing the depth of the same by sounding all the way with a lead line
with the feet marked as high as 20. I find the obstructions to con-
sist of 3 kinds viz 1" sand bars. 2" Drift wood in large deposites,
extending entirely and forming in one place a complete dam across
the river, 3" Isolated sawyers and snags in various points directly in
the channel of the river.
The water immediately above the confluence of the two rivers
above stated, is only 4 feet deep; sand bars of considerable width,
say 300 yards in the narrowest place extending entirely across the
two rivers, and subject to change their position at every high rise of
the waters. At the head of the Appalachicola, the point where my
examination commenced, I find 8 feet water and a good wide channel,
which continues 3 miles down the river as far as a small island, im-
mediately below which, there is a sand bar extending entirely across
the river upon which there is only 4% feet water. This sand bar,
together with the only other one 35 miles below at an island opposite
to Blunt's town and having 6% feet water upon it, form the only
obstruction to the navigation of the first enumerated class; the water
in no other place on the river being less than 8 feet, and channel
wide and regular, ie, invariably following the bends of the river
except at the Ochesee Bluffs, where a ridge of rocks extends from the
right bank nearly across, throwing the channel on the opposite point.
The removal of these sand bars, I apprehend, was not contemplated
by the act of Congress. Below Blunt's Town down to the Bay the
water is from 12 to 20 f* a distance of 100 miles.
There is a cut off, of one mile in length, which has become the only
passage, in consequence of the main river, being at this time entirely
stopped up by a sand bar, extending entirely across 4 or 5 feet above
water. This cut off, is full of snags and sawyers of the most dangerous
kind, and must al[so] be removed; they extend in many places nearly
* Ante, p. 31.

across the channel and down the whole distance in clusters of 8 or 10
together, about 10 to 20 feet apart. The channel, however, is deep
and the current rapid, ahé which will make them difficult of removal.
The next grand obstruction is at the River of Sticks, so called, about
10 miles further down. It consists of an accumulated mass of large
trees with their roots, thrown up at each successive freshet, and
forming a complete dam across the river, extending a quarter of mile
down the river. The water is here backed up 3 feet perpendicular,
and has vent only through a cut off, by a small passage 20 feet wide,
cut by the crews of 2 Steam boats and 2 Keel boats, who were detained
a week in the performance. The half of the appropriation must be
expended on this obstruction, and here the work must be commenced.
Steamboats cannot pass until this great obstruction be removed.
These 2 last enumerated form the obstructions of the 2" class.
The 3" class consists of isolated sawyers & snags at different points
in the river from the junction of the Flint and Chattahouchie down to
the Bay of Appalachicola, and measurably easy of removal with the
proper means and force. I have written to this Department my
former views and the mode I proposed to adopt for the removal of the
obstructions; which was to build 2 flats 60 feet long 12 feet wide,
attach them together, and erect Spanish windlasses thereon to draw
out the snags and Sawyers after they are cut off sufficiently deep.
This mode requires the employment of 20 hands for the space of 3
months together with a considerable supply of cables hausers chains
&ca &ac &a which I find are not to be procured in this Territory:
I shall be, therefore, under the necessity of going to New Orleans to
procure them. I therefore request that the funds of which I spoke
in my last communication " may be deposited to my credit at New
Orleans, where I shall be about the 20" of September next. I will,
also, there purchase at less expense by 100 per cent the provisions &a
for the supply of the hands, and have it transported to the Appa-
lachicola Bay by the 1* of October, the season of the year when the
river is at the lowest stage, and consequently the most proper time to
commence operations. The effect of the removal of the obstructions
will be that the river will be navigable at all seasons of the year as far
as Aspalaga a new town on the left bank of the Appalachicola river
about 8 miles from the junction of the Flint & Chattahouchie, for
boats not drawing over 6% feet water, and three fourths of the
year as far as the confluence, a distance of 144 miles from the Bay
of Appalachicola. The Chattahouchie is navigable at all seasons
160 miles for boats drawing 3% feet water as far as Columbus at the
falls of said river, and the Flint for boats of the same draught as far as

Bainbridge in Decatur County, Georgia, a distance of 45 miles
from the confluence passing through a fine Cotton Country and
possessing on their banks a body of lands not exceeded in fertility by
any in the Southern Country. The Appalachicola River lands are
no doubt equal to those of the Mississippi for the culture of sugar
cane, and the value of these last, will be greatly enhanced by an
uninterrupted navigation to the sea. The lands on all the above
rivers that have lately come into market are settling rapidly and the
time is not far distant when the Appalachicola and its tributary
streams will waft on its surface millions of pounds of cotton from the
up Country of Georgia and Allabama, and convey from its immediate
borders the agricultural products of thousands of acres cultivated by
wealthy & enterprising sugar planters, to a certain and easy market
at the Haeuth ef Bay of Appalachicola. Such will be the certain
effect of removing the obstructions to the navigation on this beautiful
and majestic River.
It has been suggested to me, and I have no doubt of the fact from
my own experience, that the employment of a small steamer of from
20 to 25 horse power in removing the obstructions would be a more
expeditious and less expensive method than 2 flats joined together
with Spanish windlasses erected thereon; Now if the appropriation
would cover the expense, and I am confident it will, and if the Chief
Engineer coincide in opinion with me and leave the matter to my
judgment and prudence I am bold to say, that while at NewOrleans
from information I have received, that I can purchase a good second
hand steamer of the above power, for the sum of $1500 to $2000,
together with all her cables hawsers &ca &ac, and the balance of the
appropriation would be amply sufficient to defray the expense of
10 hands (half the number when flats are to be used) for the period
that would require to remove] the obstructions, and in half the time
that from the commencement of operations. The experiment has
already been tried on the Altamaha river in Georgia, and succeeded
admirably, and indeed in the removal of some few of the most obvious
obstructions, it has been successfully tried on the Appalachicola river,
by Captain Jenkins of the Steamboat Fanny of 30 horse power, which,
by the bye, cost 18 months since, in Mobile, only $3000. Another
advantage would be that the Steamboat could be sold at the end of
the time for as much as she cost, or perhaps more, and thereby save
to the United States, that amount. I have consulted with some of
the most intelligent and respectable men at Appalachicola Bay and
they not only strongly recommend this course, but deem it impos-
sible to remove, without a greater appropriation, the obstructions in
any other way. While at NewOrleans I will acquaint the Department
with the information and data that I shall collect in relation to this

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
(with its enclosures) under date the 25" July ” by the mail before
last; I have Carefully perused the Several Communications enclosed.
and Cannot withhold an expression of Surprise at their Contents.
The Country South & east represented as So desireable, with the
exception of a Small part on the Suwannee, if I am not entirely mis-
informed, is generally, so poor as not to admit Settlements; much the
best part of it has been offered at the last Sales, and did not afford
so much interest to buyers as to induce the purchase of a dozen lots,
South of the Parallel: but of this you have the evidence in your
possession—The suggestion of Majr. Ward that my Deputies, Sent
to Survey South & east, this Spring as a reason for not Completing
that work either found it “impracticable or unprofitable,” is, to Say the
* These townships to be proclaimed to be Sold in January 1829–See letter in
answer Sep. 12. 1828–[Penciled notation in the margin opposite the above portion
of the list]. See post, p. 77.

least of it uncharitable, they are gentlemen acting under the Solemn
obligation of an Oath, and possess a reputation that would repel the
idea, that they would decline work which they were ordered to
execute under the plea of its being unprofitable, of this fact they
have given ample proof in the extremely unprofitable (and almost
ruinous work) of laying down the private claims in West Florida.
The Major, I hope labours under a mistake in the idea entertained
that his previous representations gave rise to your instructions to
the Surveyor General. I trust Sir, that your instructions grow out
of your Knowledge of the duties assigned you by your government
and a direct Communication with this office—The great Solicitude
of the Citizens to have that Section of Country run out, Seems not
to have been generally expressed; as I am free to acknowledge it is
new to me, and had they expressed Such Solicitude I could have given
them a Knowledge of the measures taken on different occasions to
have that Country Surveyed of which you have been regularly
apprised,—my letter to you of July 3rd 1827.” gave my views of
the necessity of having that Section of Country run out, and which
required your authority for So doing, having been restrained by you
in running So many Township lines—I beg leave to refer you to the
third and fifth paragraphs of M. Washingtons letter,” and the en-
closed “Official Documents” ” to satisfy you that “things are”
fairly “Conducted”. in this office. That part of your letter which
relates to the immediate duties of this office together with the Con-
tents of yours under date 1" inst "will be disposed of in a Sep-
arate Communication.
I feel that an apology is due for troubling you with this letter,
but really Sir, I Consider it a paramount duty to place my official
acts before you in their true light for many reasons, and not the least,
that of retaining your good opinion.

SIR, In your letter of instructions of the 25 July 1828" you direct
that the Township lines of all the lands in West Florida, should be
run, and the Surveys both public & private be entirely completed by
July next.
Having received your instructions some time since not to survey
those large tracts claimed by Forbes & C" and Innerarity, which lays
in West Florida, doubt exist on my mind whether you intend by your
late instructions to include them or not. Will you have the goodness
to inform me what your present views are, on this subject, as I should
deem it my duty under the late instructions to include those claims.
The instructions contained in your letter of the 1" of August
1828" received by the last mail & which relates to surveying of the
private claims in West Florida, shall be immediately attended to—
The duties incident to laying down those claims, when the lands have
been run out will be particularly distressing and ruinous to the Depu-
ties employed, as I have no doubt a large portion of the claimants will
pay no attention to their interest and the claims are so imperfect in
their locations & land marks that it is impossible for the Surveyors to
proceed without the Claimants identifying them in person.
These continued efforts on the part of the Government to induce
Claimants to have their rights Secured, is Certainly praiseworthy, but
on the other hand, how distressing to the persons employed in the
execution of these duties, and withal, what an extension of duties and
rendered more difficult involves upon this office.—I hope and trust
that when the Surveys to the east are to be executed, that I shall be
authorised to give timely notice and to finally close the surveys (as
the Deputies progress) under the provisions of the Laws.
I have received a Copy of the Acts passed at the last Session, this
evening by mail, also the revised Land laws as advised in your note.

MY DEAR SIR—Your letter of the 4" ulto," thro some probable
failure on the northern mail route was not received untill a few days
since, and a misunderstanding about the departure of the Post boy
from this neighbourhood prevented my replying. as I intended, by
the last mail from Tallahassee—
I could have wished your letter of appointment to have been accom-
panied with the instructions of which you speak, as without them I do
not feel prepared either to decline or accept of the situation proferred
me—If the necessary examinations of the channel way to be im-
proved have been made by the U S Engineers, and a plan for the
execution of the work has been matured, and the appropriation made
by Congress corresponds with or exceeds the estimates in the official
report in your Department: you may consider this as my acceptance

If however no examination of the Inland passage between the S*
Marys & St Johns has been made, and no report on the most advisable
or feasible plan for the improvement of its navigation has been sub-
mitted to your consideration, and the appropriation made by Con-
gress is an arbitrary sum granted on the vague representations of
private Individuals; and your appointment is to be considered as con-
ferring on me full powers with the consequent responsibility of accom-
plishing a speculative object within the pecuniary appropriation made,
you must receive this as declining an appointment requiring, in the
first place nearly a full season to make the preliminary examinations
and to mature a plan for the work and fully another to execute the
same with the possibility of being embarrassed from the sum allowed
proving inadequate to the object to be accomplished—You will from
the above readily comprehend the views I take of this subject—I can-
not without a very great sacrifice of my private interests devote more
than one season to the work contemplated, which however would be
sufficient if the preliminary examination plans &c have been made;
and I would not hazard on inadequate means the possibility of a
failure—If therefore from a knowledge of the facts you feel authorised
to receive this as an acceptance of the appointment proferred me:
you will be good enough to forward without delay the necessary in-
struments, plans &c on the receipt of which I shall be prepared to
commence operations—You will have no time to loose, as a portion of
the first part of the season favourable to [the oper]ations contemplated
will be lost in [MS. torn] preliminary arrangements which will have to

October & shall expect to hear from you on all events by the 1 Week of
the same month—I presume the contract system for the work to be
performed will meet with your approbation & if so it will require some
time in extending notices so as to elicit competition—

[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., B 210:ALS]
CANTO: BROOKE Septbr 9" 1828
SIR I had the honor to receive by the last mail, yours of the 8"
Ultimo," relative to the quantity of land which should be reserved,
for the use of this post.
In answer thereto, I have to report, that the lands, in the neighbor-
hood, are excessively poor, and barren, and, that, they are not sus-
ceptible, of the least valuable cultivation. They are interspersed, with
live oak hammocks, which may be considered, as, its only value, and
no doubt, if, taken care of, are, and will be, of much national impor-
tance. The reservation, bearing in view, the exclusion of persons,
disposed to sell ardent spirits, to the troops, should be so extensive,
that the men, could not absent, themselves, for the time, which, it
would require, to go, and return, from the houses, of those squatters,
without being detected. The chief (and may be said) the only object
of those settlers, is, to dispose of whiskey to the troops, and Indians,
which they have, and continue to do, to the great annoyance of the
command, and injury to the soldiers, and Indians.
I would therefore recommend, that the reservation, should com-
mence from Gadsden point, (which separates, Tampa, from Hills-
borough, bay, the latter ef of which, we are located on) along the
eastern shore of Tampa, to its head, from thence, a due north course,
to the Indian boundary line, then east, along this line, to a spot,
opposite, the eastern side of the Thlonotossassa, hammock, (and in-
cluding to said hammock) and from thence, a due south east course,
til it strikes the Allaphia river, (with the islands, in the Hillsborough
bay. A reservation less than this would be of little utility, because,
if it does not extend, to the Indian line, those squatters, would estab-
lish themselves between the reservation, and the Indian boundary,
by which location, they would be, both, in the immediate neighborhood
of the Indians, and the Cantonment. This reservation, would extend
from seven, to fifteen miles, and, in no instance, farther from the Post.
It would be desirable, that this reservation should be established, as
soon, as practicable, as I have been informed, that several settlers,

Benvenue or Lockacray near Tallahassee FLORIDA September 11" 1828.
SIR, In obedience to the orders of the Engineer Department of the
30" June last, " I proceeded to make a survey of the River and
Harbour of S’ Marks, Florida, with the view of ascertaining the
practicability and expense of removing the obstructions to the naviga-
tion of the same. I commenced my operations at the natural bridge
of the S" Marks (a distance of eighteen miles from the junction of the
S" Marks and Wakully Rivers, and the point to which the navigation
of small crafts had already extended, and at which it must of necessity
stop) and proceeded as far as the extreme point of the shoals in the
Bay of Appalachie embracing the whole of the the objects contemplated
by the Act of Congress on this subject.
The River St Marks rises suddenly from the ground, and forms a
beautiful basin of two hundred & fifty yards wide, and nearly a quarter
of a mile in length, presenting to the delighted spectator a bold sub-
stantial stream of one hundred yards wide and continuing with occa-

are two obstructions of the first class, or order; One a mile below the
basin; and the other about two miles farther down the River. They
both consist of a stratum of soft limestone rock running entirely across
the river, about one hundred yards in width, and leaving only a depth
of three feet water, for the passage of the Keel Boats. They would
require a very considerable sum to remove them; but in as much as I
did not consider this class of obstructions enbraced within the Act of
Congress or my instructions, I made no attempt to form any correct
estimate of the amount required to remove them to the depth that
would render the river, thus high up, susceptible of navigation for
vessels frequenting the tide water below. A channel of twenty feet
wide, and three feet deep, cut out of the rock, allowing a passage for
boats drawing six feet water, would cost not less than three thousand
dollars.
Many logs and trees have fallen from the banks on each side which
in one instance at a small Island have nearly damed up the river,
rendering the passage for Keel-boats very difficult and somewhat
hazardous. They can easily be removed at a trifling expense. These
last obstructions appertain to the 2" class.
About three quarters of a mile below the town of Magnolia, there
is a casual of obstruction about one hundred yards long and twenty
feet broad, lying at the bottom and paralel with the river, on the right
bank, consisting of a deposite of mud and grass, the removal of which,
would make the river navigable for vessels drawing ten feet of water
at high tide. The peculiar locality of this deposit has thrown the
whole volume of water on the left bank, and caused an increase in the
current so as to form a very considerable rapid. The removal of this
casual obstruction so as to make the river, thus far, in high tide,
navigable for vessels drawing ten feet water would cost five hundred
dollars; an inconsiderable sum, when the difference and draft of water
to be obtained, is considered. Wessels drawing over six feet water
are now under the necessity of lightening their cargoes before they can
reach Magnolia, their post of destination, three fourths of a mile
above. The river from this place presents no serious obstructions,
if we except a few remnants of fallen timber near the banks, which the
enterprising citizens of Magnolia have accidentally left in clearing
the river of these accidental impedements to the navigation.
At Fort St Marks the depth of water in low tide is ten feet. The
tide here ebbs and flows twice in twenty four hours, and rises not
less than three, nor more than four feet, each tide. There are phe-
nomena which do not occur in any of the rivers or harbours of the
northern side of the Gulph of Mexico. The tide in all the other
principal bays and rivers in this great Estuary ebbs and flows only

once in twenty four hours and never rises over two feet perpendicular
on ordinary tides.
The next obstruction in the River (at this place called the Appalachie
after its junction with the Wakully) is at the Middle ground, so called,
about three miles distant from Fort S. Marks; and as one of those
obstructions originally contemplated to be removed by the framers
of the Act of Congress, but subsequently extended to the S" Marks
river, properly so called. It must be observed that the channel of
the river St Marks runs, & is nearly coequal with its width and follows
its uniformly in its meanders, except at the points forming rapids:
but the moment we enter the Appalachie, the river and the channel
are two distinct objects, and not at all dependent in their respective
courses upon each other. I have therefore taken great care to lay
down on the map the precise course of the channel with its depth at
low water mark as well as the obstructions presented to view at the
same stage of water, in order that the Department may more fully
understand their nature and extent. The obstructions in this river
Appalachie which are of the casual or accidental class have been
considered in a two-fold point of view: first as to their peculiar lo-
cality, causing an angle in the channel; and secondly: as to their
nature, as respects the materials of which they are composed. The
one under contemplation, consists of two oyster bars, extending from
either bank of the river, and so situated with regard to each other
as to cause a right angle in the channel, and at same time blocking
up a certain portion of it.
It has generally been considered by coastwise navigators that a
channel not exceedingly tortuous of one hundred yards in width is
sufficient for vessels in their trade, drawing generally when loaded
from eight to ten feet water. In ascertaining the extent and making
an estimate of the practicability an expense of removing an obstruc-
tion to the navigation of a river or harbour calculated only for the
entrance of coasters of this large class, I was governed by this rule,
and conceived, that only to be, in fact, an obstruction to the navi-
gation, which embraced either or both these impediments. At the
point now under consideration the channel is somewhat crooked, and
the oyster-bar forms a point of projection forty-five yards, leaving a
channel only fifty five yards wide and eight feet at low water mark.
It is proposed to cut off this point or bar forty five yards; and in
order to make the water of equal depth with that in the channel
above Wiz, ten feet, and to deepen the present one two feet more,
making ten feet water at low tide, and a passage one hundred yards
wide, tolerably straight. The point or bar as well as the bottom of
the channel, is composed of Oysters in bed, and in detached parcels.
This spot is designated on the map by the colour of red.


## p. 73 (#85) ##############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R H TO R Y 73
The next and main obstruction in the channel of the river is the
one at a place called “the Devils Elbow,” and designated on the map
by the colour of blue. It is composed of the same materials as the
preceeding one, and differs only in its extent, and the acuteness of
the angle, and the width of the channel and the depth of the water.
The channel is very crooked, and narrow, being only twenty-five
yards wide and the water very shallow only six and a half feet deep.
In making an estimate of the expense of removing this, and the
preceeding obstruction, I was governed entirely by the mode to be
pursued in their removal.
I propose to the consideration of the Department the following
method of removing these two last enumerated obstructions. The
improved Mud Machine now in use for clearing out the docks and
rivers on the Atlantic Sea-board, is undoubtly the only cheap mode
of effecting an excavation in places of this sort, and could be used to
great advantage in the river and harbour of S’ Marks.
It may be objected that these machines are only used in removing
soft mud, and that they are not applicable to purposes of this kind:
but from the knowledge I have of their capacities to remove any loose
bodies under water, I am convinced, that their application to the
removal of Oyster-bars would be attended with complete success;
provided the materials of which these bars are composed, were so
loosened and detached as to enable the scoop of the machine to em-
brace their contents in detached portions. I propose to detach and
loosen the Oyster-bars by means of iron-crow-bars sharpened and
flattened at one end. The operators must stand in a flat or scull
moored at the proper place, and I have no doubt that four hands
in a day would detach as many of the oysters or clamps on the bar
as the machine would raise and deposit in the scow. Admitting the
cost of the mud machine to be fifteen hundred dollars, together with
the flat and utensils; I think I hazzard not too much in saying that
an additional sum of five thousand dollars would be amply sufficient
to remove every obstruction in the Appalachie River and make it
navigable for vessels drawing thirteen feet water.
From this point there exist no farther obstructions to the naviga-
tion. There are, it will be perceived, many Oyster-bars and shoals
in the Bay, laid down on the map, but the passage through them
being at the narrowest, not less than one hundred and fifty yards
wide and increasing the nearer we approach the Sea, Bay to the width
of a quarter of a mile, I have deemed it unnecessary to make an esti-
mate of the expense of removing any other of the bars; as the channel,
independently of its increased width, is not very tortuous, and the
depth of the water, fourteen feet, being one foot more than is proposed

to take up to Fort S" Marks by the removal of the Oyster-bars at
the localities, already mentioned.
With the view of facilitating the entrance of vessels into the har-
bour of S’ Marks, I respectfully recommend to the Department the
necessity of an appropriation for the establishment of buoys and
beacons on the shoals in the Bay of Appalachie, and the mouth of
the river. A pair of Beacons on the shoals, would be sufficient,
and about a dozen buoys, on the principal Oyster-bars at the mouth
of the River, would render the navigation at all times more easy and
certain and less precarious and more durable than the Stakes put
up by the Pilot, for his own special guidance."

SIR. In reply to your letter of the 1st Ins".” I have to state that I
do not perceive any necessity for extending, for the present, the Town-

I am well aware of the embarrassments experienced by the Deputy
Surveyors arising out of the negligence of the claimants to come for-
ward and designate such claims as are not so distinctly described in
the records on which they were confirmed as to enable the Deputy to
find & survey them without the aid of the claimant and I very much
regret that there has been an omission in all the Laws confirming
private claims to make provision for compelling the claimants to have
their Lands surveyed within a given period. There is a necessity on
the part of the Gov" for surveying those claims in order to ascertain
the public Lands subject to Sale. The 7th Sect. of the Act passed the
8th of February 1827.” directs the manner in which this shall be
done and all that can be expected of the Executive Officers is that
they procure all the information which the public archives contain
of the locality and description of each claim, and use due diligence &
precaution in carrying into effect the instructions given under the pro-
visions of that Section. When these means will not enable you to lay

SIR, Your report on the removal of obstructions to the navigation of
the Apalachicola River has been received," & I am instructed, by the
Chief Engineer, to say that it is, as far as it goes, very satisfactory,
but it is necessary that a detailed estimate of the expense of effec-
tually removing the obstructions should be made, in order that if the
sum actually appropriated should be found insufficient for that pur-
pose, the additional amount required may be embraced in the general
estimates of this Department for the ensuing year—The employment
of a steam boat whilst the sum appropriated is so small, is deemed a
hazardous experiment, & the other method you propose for carrying
on the operations (by means of flat boats & windlasses) will therefore
be adopted, & your plan of commencing at the lower obstructions is
approved—To enable you to carry the project into effect, a requisition
is this day made for $1500 to be deposited to your credit in the Branch
of the U. S. Bank at New Orleans agreeably to your request—With
respect to the removal of the lower obstructions, at the place called the
“River of sticks,” it is suggested whether it will not be more feasible to

RICHARD C. ALLEN TO GOVERNOR DUVAL
[LC:Pensacola, Florida Argus, Nov. 4, 1828*]
TALLAHASSEE, Oct. 6, 1828.
HIS EXCELLENCY WM. P. DUVAL,
SIR, Having in the fall of 1826 at your request, accepted the agency
for the location of the Seminary Lands in this Territory, and having
completed the locations, as nearly as is thought consistent with the
interests of the Territory, under present circumstances. I think it
proper to lay before you the result of my labours, and to present for
your consideration and opinion, whether under present circumstances,
the location of a portion of the land, should not be deferred for the
present until the public surveys are further prosecuted. It will be
recollected that an act of Congress, approved 3d March, 1823, granted
for a Seminary of learning in the Territory, a township of land in each
of the Districts of East and West-Florida.” Under this act, and in
pursuance of your directions, I proceeded to the examination of the
country West of the Suwanee river, and after a most minute and care-
ful [examination]” of a great number of Townships, assisted by Major
Romeo Lewis and others, I made choice of, and selected, Township 5,
North of range 11 West, situated West of the Chippola river, in the
county of Jackson. The Register of the Land-Office at this place had
due notice of the selection, as had your excellency, by the agent's
report. The Government of the United States afterwards sold to pre-
emption claimants, nearly one-third of the Township selected. By
an act of Congress, approved 29th January, 1827, it is provided that
the deficiency may be supplied by locating the quantity covered by
those claims in “sections upon any unappropriated lands in said district
of country.” *—This last act also provides for the location of the re-
maining Township in sections, East of the Appalachicola River. It
therefore became necessary to re-examine the country West and East
of that river, and to be much more special and minute in the examina-
tion, than was required in the observations previously taken, with a
view to the selection of the best Township, as was provided by the
act of 1823. I have succeeded in obtaining about 22 Sections East,
and about 8 West of the Appalachicola River, and probably from 3
to 6 others may be located to tolerable advantage East of the Oscilla
river, in a tract of country already surveyed. There will then remain
about 14 sections to be located which I have no doubt may be hereafter
laid upon valuable lands; but at present, and under the law as it now

reads, it is impossible to obtain lands of much value. It is therefore
respectfully submitted whether it is not proper to hold in reserve a
portion of those lands to be disposed of according as after events may
suggest. In relation to the quality and situation of the lands already
selected, I will merely remark, that they are believed to have been been
located, all circumstances considered, to the very best advantage, and
that with very few exceptions, they could be readily sold at fair prices,
and the agent can with great confidence assure your Excellency, that
he has exerted all reasonable industry and diligence, and in many
instances incurred considerable money expenses, to obtain for the
Seminary the most eligible situations and the best lands. A list of
the lands selected, and maps shewing the situation of each tract will
be furnished if thought necessary.”

WASHINGTON CITY, October 6* 1828.
SIR, Agreeably to your request, I communicate to you the informa-
tions in my possession in relation to the Inland-Passage from S“Mary's
harbour (G") to St John river (F*).
Two water communications might be opened between S" Mary's
harbour and S" John river: one for boats through what is called
Inland-Passage, and which, on account of the numerous, short and nar-
row windings, could not admit of the passage of sloops unless large
expenditures should be made. The other should be a thorough cut
canal from Bell river to a branch of Nassau river and would form a
link of the contemplated line of inland navigation along the atlantic
coast.
In regard to the former or present existing communication, the
ports where the tides meet are those that require improvement; they
are denoted in red ink on the map surveyed under the direction of
L* Colonel Perrault.”
The first obstruction is found between St Mary's harbour and
Nassau river; it consists of a shallow channel, two miles in length,
* A petition by the Legislative Council of Florida for permission to dispose of
lands reserved for schools and seminaries was referred to the House Committee
on Public Lands, Jan. 28, 1828 (House Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., p. 225). No
report has been found.
* In NA (CR, WD, CE Civil Works File, L 23a) is an undated map of St.
Marys Harbor, the inland passage, and part of St. Johns River by Lt. Col. P. H.

left dry at low tide, and affording about three feet at high tide.—To
improve this channel to a depth of four feet at common half tide and
on a width of thirty feet, the expense would be about . . . $8.400.
The Second obstruction, between Nassau river and Talbot inlet, is
700 yards in length; it is left dry at low tide.—To improve this channel
to a depth of four feet at common half tide and on a width of twenty
yards, the expense would be about . . . . . . . . . . . . $3.300.
The third obstruction, between Talbot inlet and the S" John, has
a length of four hundred yards and is but one foot deep at low tide.—
The improvement of this place, on a convenient width, would cost
about . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1.400
The fourth and last obstruction is at the Sisters: it is a narrow bar
which would require for its improvement about . . . . . . $340.
Therefore to render the Inland Passage navigable through out, at
half common tide, for boats not drawing more than three feet and a
half, an expense of 13.440 dollars will be necessary and would be
sufficient should the work be judiciously directed.”

COL” THO" LM"KENNEY Gen Supt Indian Affairs
SIR, I have lately visited the Indians on Appalachicola River and
find the Chiefs anxious to visit the Country west of the Mississippi.
I found the Indians much afflicted with the venerial disease in its
worst form; many of them are very ill. I have ordered that medical
assistance should be furnished to them. These Indians residing
immediately on the River, must soon become extinct. The trade is
increasing fast and their intercourse with the boatmen, will certainly
destroy them. I suppose that not less than fifty of them are now ill
and Several dangerous.
Humanity demands the removal of these unfortunate people as
early as possible.
I am respectfully Your Obt St

SIR. I have the honor to return the T. plats inclosed with your
letter of the 13" Ult°* and to remark in explanation that the Escam-
bia River was not laid down, owing to an oversight of the Draftsman
and escaped our observation in the general examination—You will
observe a difference in the appearance of the Conecuh River on the
township plats arising from the fact of having a meridian run on the
west, which differs in a small degree from the paralels of the surveys
East; they having been extended under many difficulties of swamps,
water courses, and bad ground—The necessity for this course was made
manifest by the representations of the Dep’ surveyer that in many
places the connection could not be made across that river and there-
fore the survey was connected with its margin giving rise to the small
difference observable.

of valuable timber upon the Public Lands.” In my letter I omitted
to mention one class of depredators upon the public lands who inflict
more injury than they who merely cut the Public Timber for sale I
mean the squatters upon the lands lyeing on the waters of Pensacola
Bay which are suitable for Brick Yards. Since the date of my letter
I have been informed of several Brick Yards which have been recently
established and of its being had in contemplation by individuals here

country is to be found in small spots only. and these spots when
favorably situated upon water courses are very valuable. It is
belived that the only clay in the U States of which fire bricks can be
made is to be found in the neighborhood of this place and the few
bricks which have been sent from here for sale, to New York & Phila-

the clay is not the least evil which the government will suffer, since
the timber on the neighboring lands will be consumed with very little

SIR I beg respectfully to ask your attention to the accompanying
resolutions of the Board of Aldermen of this City—In the discharge
of the duty which these resolutions impose upon me little more is
necessary on my part than to lay them before you
The deep interest which this City has in the expeditious and
substantial construction of the Bridge in question and in the faithful
application of the means appropriated by the Government for this
purpose will it is not doubted be appreciated by you as a just cause for
the present claim upon your Consideration.
The great diminution of the force originally employed in this work
by the removal of twenty four men and one officer from a detachment
consisting of ninety men, which took place about three weeks since, was
seen by the inhabitants of this City with much regret, as tending
materially to retard its progress, while the current and continuing
expenditures to be met out of the appropriation for the work were
understood to be very immaterially, if at all, reduced by this reduction
of force—But now that the work is entirely suspended, and, as it is
understood, will continue so until the month of October, the City
authorities have felt they would be wanting in duty, if they refrained
from soliciting your interference—The suspension of this work is
alleged to have taken place under a general order having in view the
preservation of the health of the troops in warm climates—Though this

climate bea warm one, it is respectfully suggested that, in this particular
part of the Country, it is not only an innoxious but an extremely salu-
briousand healthful climate; and that during no part of the Summer are
the ordinary labors of those whose avocations expose them to its
unmitigated influence, abandoned or suspended—It is therefore
believed that the troops engaged in this work might labor with entire
security during seven or eight hours in the day; yielding to their
unclimatized constitutions, if indeed they be unaccustomed to a warm
climate, repose during the extreme heat of the day;-thereby saving
very considerably of the limited appropriation allowed for the con-
struction of this Bridge and the necessary Causeways—The Causeways
designed to connect the Bridge with the main land being left in
an incomplete state, with several unfinished sluices through them,
cannot it is believed be thus subjected to the ordinary action of the tide
without suffering very material injury; and much fear is entertained
that if this work be allowed to remain in the condition in which it is
at present until the month of October, it will not only be much
impaired, but will in all probability—be wholly destroyed by the
equinoxial storms of the approaching autumn, from which we are
rarely entirely exempted—
These considerations together with the resolutions on which they
are founded are submitted to you very respectfully, and under a
perfect conviction that you will not only see the reasonableness of the
anxiety of the municipal authorites of this place on the subject to
which they refer; but that you will by every means in your power
promote and secure to the inhabitants of this part of the Territory

Whereas the appropriation lately made by the General Government
for Constructing a bridge over the S. Sebastians river being too

of said appropriation to construct said Bridge, with the assistance
of a detachment of U.S. Soldiers, previously employed in opening
public roads, and then under the Command of Said Lieut. Brown; And

where as even with this additional aid of the U.S. Soldiers, said
appropriation may be insuficient unless said work be conducted with-
out any unnecessary obstacles thrown in the way to its completion:
And whereas said work is necessarily retarded by the removal of a
Number of the Soldiers who have been employed on it. And whereas
it is at present entirely stopped, and said bridge left in an unfinished
State, in consequence of Same Order to the Officer now Commanding
Said detachment of Soldiers—that the Said Soldiers discontinue the
work untill September or October Next. And whereas said appropri-
ation now Small is consuming away by the heavy expences necessarily
incurred during the Suspension of said work. And whereas these
circumstances not only prevent a speedy completion of Said bridge,
but may eventually defeat it altogether, Therefore,
Resolved that the construction of Said bridge is a matter of deep
interest to the Citizens of this place, and they view with concern any
unnecessary interruption in the work which tends to delay, and may
eventually prevent the Completion of so desirable an object.
Resolved that a representation be made through the Mayor to the
Quarter Master General, of the present condition of Said bridge and
the circumstances which delay and will probably prevent its com-
pletion—and that he be respectfully solicited to permit the number
of soldiers already removed, and such as may be hereafter removed,
to be replaced by an equal number of others; and that the said
Lieut. Brown be permitted to proceed with the Soldiers to finish and
complete said bridge.

DAVID B. MACOMB TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER
[NA:WD, CE Lets. Recd., M485:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE October 15th 1828.
SIR. Your communication of the 23"September has been received."
The peculiar nature of the deposites of drift wood and timber, and
large trees, together with their peculiar localities, render a correct
estimate of the sum required to remove them effectually, almost a
matter of impossibility. I have in addition to my own experience
founded on a personal examination of the obstructions to the naviga-
tion of the Appalachicola River taken great pains to acquire informa-
tion from persons formerly engaged in removing similar obstructions
on the Altamaha, and they have coincided in opinion, with me as to
the number of hands necessary to be employed and the time requisite
in a good stage of water, to remove effectually those on the Appalachi-
cola. It has been my endeavour, in making the estimate transmitted
to the Department, to confine the expenses within the amount of the
appropriation; and I have since my reconnoissance of the river,
entertained no doubt, that the appropriation is sufficient for the object.
Indeed, upon a subsequent examination of the “river of sticks”
from which I have just returned, I had come to the resolution of
removing the island as suggested, and rendering navigiable the cut
or thoroughfare, as suggested in your communication, considering it
as the only mode of securing uninterruptedly the navigation of this
important river at this place.
For the purpose of making the Department better acquainted
with the peculiar locality of this obstruction, I have sketched a map
of the river for a half a mile above and below the place called the
“River of Sticks”. I have also marked the channel (by dots,) as
it actually exists, and laid down the islands and the relative situation
of the existing obstructions.
It must be observed that the channel of the Appalachicola follows
and probably more regularly depends upon its sinuosities (with one
exception, viz at a place called the Ochessee Bluffs, where a stratum
of rock extending nearly across the river, throws the channel on the
point) than any river in North America; the deepest water being
invariably, if unobstructed by fallen timber from the banks; within
a few yards of the shore, in the cavities or bends of the river.
The large island on the west side, was, I have no doubt, originally
a part of the Point, and the channel ran, agreably to the above
premises, between it and the small island on the East side, and also
in high freshets though the cut, between it and the East Bank of

the River: but the small island (er; at that time the only island)
from its peculiar situation near the bend on the East side, served in no
small degree to force the ehahhel current towards the point upon the
West side of the river; (particularly in high freshets, when the head
of the cut or thoroughfare on the East side became blocked up by
drift wood and trees) and requiring consequently a greater vent,
than was afforded, between the then Point on the West side and this
island, it forced its way through the low ground, behind the then
point, and formed a new course for itself, which from its width and
depth previously to its being filled up, as represented on the map,
has been deemed by Boatmen, to be the real channel of the River.
But, subsequently, by the deposite of drift wood on the point of the
newly formed island, and its accumulation farther down, this new
channel became entirely filled up; a circumstance owing, no doubt,
to the decrease of the island on the East side; the channel between
which and the-Point island increased in width in the same ratio.
In this stage of the process, it would appear, that nothing more would
be required than to have waited the results of future freshets, the
effect of which would in time, entirely remove the small island, and
thereby cause the channel to move in its natural (with respect to the
bend of the river) course, without the least danger of a future deposite;
but, it so happened, that the accummulation of drift wood and trees
ea on the point island has latterly been greater than the decrease
of the small island, and at this time extends within twenty feet of
the lower point of it, and the cut or throroughfare between this small
island and the East shore, being, at its head, entirely blocked up by
a sand bar and a considerable deposite of driftwood also, it necessarily
follows that in order to insure a permanent channel not liable to be
obstructed, the small island, as well as the deposite of drift wood, or
dam between the two islands ought to be entirely removed; all which
I had come to the determination to do; and have made my arrange-
ments accordingly: my hands are nearly all engaged, and will be in
readiness when the flats are finished: In the meantime I shall now
hasten to New Orleans to purchase hawsers, ropes tackel &ca &ca,
which I informed the department could not be procured in this
part of the Territory, and hope to be in successful operation on the
River Sticks in two weeks from date: our Packets generally perform
the trips to NewOrleans in two weeks and sometimes less.
With regard to the comparative expense of removing the obstruc-
tions at the above place on the Appalachicola, in the mode already
communicated to the Department and the one above suggested, I
have no hesitation in declaring the latter mode of removing the island
and rendering navigiable the Cut or thoroughfare, to be the least

expensive in the end; as well as the only one by which the navigation
can be made permanent and not subject to future obstructions. This
island is 200 yards long and 55 yards wide in the widest place. I
propose to cut several small channels through the island, and suffer
the current to pass through. the depth of the channel or cuts would
be 8 feet, which is the height of the island above the surface of the
water, and the width from 4 to 6 feet. wide; then cuts would, from
the peculiar composition of the island soon enlarge themselves; and
by assisting the operation with the spade after having previously
removed the timber and trees, I have no doubt that in a short time
the whole island might in this way be removed, and open thereby a
larger space for the water to pass, reduce it to its natural level (ahd
it is 2% feet higher above the obstruction or dam) and enable me to
work away with greater facility the drift and timber between the
two islands. When this is effected I shall consider the half of my
commission as executed. After I shall have completed the removal
of the obstructions at the place called the River of Sticks, I will
report progress to the Department, and proceed, if the stage of the
water permit, to the removal of the remaining obstructions"

SEMINOLE AGENCY 20th Oct 1828
COL THOMAS L. MCKENNY
SIR, I have the satisfaction to state, to you, for the information of
the department of war, that at a meeting of chiefs and others of the
Seminole Nation held yesterday at M*Kenzie's Pond, near this
Agency, pursuant to appointment made by me, for the purpose of
procuring the nation to send a deputation to examine the Country
West of the Mississippi; it was determined, that the measure should
be adopted, if still called for by the Government, and a deputation
Sent, at the opening of the ensuing Spring—The Chiefs in Council
were Hicks (Head Chief) Holata Emathla; Holata Mico, Fuke lustee
Hajo, Hitchitee-Mico, Tuskumhaw. & the Sub Chief Mad-Lizard.—
The four first named will doubtless be recollected by you, as a part of
the delegation which visited the Seat of Government in 1826." Their
wishes tribes, with two or three others, not represented in the meeting,
but which may be safely relied upon to join, should the wished for
emigration take place; comprises at least two thirds of the numerical
strength of the whole nation.
I have good reason to suppose, that this unexpected determination
on the part of the Chiefs above mentioned, has been induced (among
other reasons) by my volunteering to accompany them, on the pro-
posed excursion; which I was led to do; from a belief, that the step, as
primary to a final removal of the Nation, is desired by the Govern-
ment: and a conviction I have long felt, that Such removal, under
suitable and fair circumstances, would tend to the benefit & happiness
of the Indians themselves:—distressed as I know these people are, by
irremidiable evils within the present limits of their National Territory,
& harassed by the persecution of their neighbors without and judging

from the reputed character of the new country offered to them, I think
it may be confidently calculated, that a visit to it, will result in a
general & entire removal of the Nation.—If I have understood the
views of the Government aright on this subject, and the measure
proposed, receives its approval; little desirable to any one, in point of
personal convenience and comfort, as the duty of executing it, must
necessarily be; it will nevertheless afford me gratification, to be
instrumental in carrying it into effect; especially, as my engaging in it,
seems to be considered a point of so much importance by the Indians—
In conferring, as I have, with the chiefs, in relation to the suggested
journey; I have acted, it is true, without any formally delegated
authority; but I have at the same time, been influenced, by a wish to
promote the object of the department & should the steps I have taken
be sanctioned, it will be to me, matter of pride:—If, on the contrary,
the disapprobation of the department should be awarded to me, a
notice to that effect, will easily correct the error and do away all that
has been done "—

Col° White of Florida,” as the delegate of those who felt aggrieved,
and others, charging the agent with a want of disposition to aid them
in recovering their run-away Slaves.” From time to time orders were
issued from this Office of the most peremptory character,” perfectly
to the satisfaction of the claimants, who, however, always responded
that they would have no avail since Col° Humphreys was determined
not to assist them in the recovery of their prosperity. At last, special
charges, more serious in their nature came in—The first—I report is
made by a M. Kingsley.” He charges the agent with having kept
one of his Slaves on his own farm under a borrowed name, one year
after he had applied for him; and states the confession of the identity
was only extorted from the agent, at last, by his having got secret
information of the identity, when he was given up. The agent's
defence was, he was not known to be the same negro. He charges
him also with having kept, for a whole year, Mr. Cooks negroes after
he had been positively ordered by the Secretary of War to give them
up.
Second—A report of the Legislative Council and resolution, strongly
implicating the agent with an illicit trafic in slaves, and with being
opposed to the emigration of Indians from Florida "-but no proof
accompanies it.
Third—A letter from J. M. Hanson, unfavorable to the agents
veracity, and charging the trouble Mr" Cook has had to his indis-
position to carry the orders of the Department into effect."
Fourth—Another letter detailing the vexatious state of things in
regard to the agents conduct, and says if the War Department was
informed of the dissatisfaction that exists among the people of the
Territory, generally, against Col”. Humphreys, he would be removed
immediately. It is certainly true that great dissatisfaction does exist.
Col”. Humphreys pleads his inability to do more than he does to meet
their wishes in regard to their Slaves.
Fifth—A letter from Archibald Clark, charges the agent with op-
posing obstacles to the recovery of Slaves on the grounds that the
bondsman which were required to be given in security to abide the
final issue of a trial, did not live in Florida *—After detaining the

Messenger thirty days, keeping up meanwhile, the impression that
the bonds were acceptable. The letter is a strong one, and I know
no excuse that can be offered for the agent in the course he took. I
consider him as having, by his conduct, virtually put at definace the
order of the Department—The plea he makes that security within
the Territory was necessary, cannot be sustained, since it was not
required.
Sixth—Charges against the agent upon oath. William Everett
swears that he went to the agency to claim seven negroes.” The
demand for them was made in writing. The agent promised to con-
vene the Chiefs to consult them about the delivery of the Slaves.
Affiant waited a long time, but the Chiefs were not called together.
The Chiefs when called, declined to take and deliver the Slaves.—
The agent then proposed to buy the Slaves. It was refused. But
finally it was agreed to sell and at a reduced price two of them, they
being all over whom the affiant and the person with him had control.
The terms of the agent were accepted from a belief that unless they
were, all would be lost. He has no doubt but the Chiefs would have
brought in the Slaves had the agent directed it. Affiant has been
much about the agency, and from what he has seen, and knows, has
no doubt the agent is engaged in speculating in the purchase of Slaves
among the Indians—that instead of aiding in their recovery, he
raises obstacles in order to purchase them at reduced prices. He does
not believe that any man has a reasonable hope of obtaining slaves
from the Indians unless the agent will do his duty, with more zeal
and sincerity than he has witnessed in his own business. The slaves
sold to the agent had never been seen until after the sale, when he saw
one of them. The others, the agent told Affiant he had seen, and that
they would come to him.
This testimony being on oath, and transmitted by the Governor
entitles it to credit. But whether the agent could break the force of
it by any opposing testimony is not known. If the case be as it is
stated, without any palliating circumstances the agent cannot be
justified. Indeed he was expressly forbid buying Slaves, by this
office, under the usual sanction, and authority of the Department
of War. This express order it appears he has disregarded.
The agent is charged by J. M. Hanson, with employing workmen
in erecting buildings for his own use, and charging the cost to the
Government—the buildings referr'd to, are, a house for a sugar
mill." Mr. Hanson says the above can be proved. Other work as
reported by a respectable mason to Mr. Hanson, amounting to 170,

or 180 Dollars, was, about one half of it, setting sugar Kettles for
the agent, was included by the agent as work done for the United
States—The agent giving the mason his own private note for the
amount, which has not been yet paid. This, it is asserted, can be
proved. Hanson promises to prefer charges, and meanwhile asks the
Governor to with hold the money for the agency House—as he will
be able to prove the accounts unjust.
Governor Duval considers it important that the conduct of the
agent be inquired into, but by some one other than a Citizen of
Florida—whose feelings could be warped no way.
I submit herewith Col° Humphreys explanations &", N° 7 and 8."—
The remarks I respectfully add to this hasty synopsis, are, there
exists against the agent great excitement in Florida—He is loudly,
and constantly complained against, and has been for two years—the
directions of the Department have not been conformed to by him, on
the questions of difficulty—His answers, and reasons appear evasive—
The charges against him on oath, are serious, and if not met, would
make his removal indispensable. But whether true or not, such is the
excitement against the agent in Florida, and especially since the
Governor has assumed the relation to him which he has, as to make
his services in that quarter of but little, if any use to the Government
whilst his dealing in Slaves in direct violation of an express order for-
bidding it, indicates a feeling of insubordination which makes it
questionable whether orders on any other subject would be met
differently. If not it is manifest that the duties of the agency could
be more acceptably performed by some one else."
Respectfully submitted.

Forbes & C* now of record on the Equity side of the District Court,
and subject to my controul as the District Attorney of Middle
Florida.—It is Scarcely necessary to remind you of the importance of
this claim, but I consider it my duty to give the department to under-
stand, that the Claimants have filed in this Cause a documentary
title of a most formidable character, linking together their chain of
evidence so strong, as to require on the part of the government the
most decided vigilance—
First then I will bring to your notice the leading facts, and Secondly
I will point out, the only remedy in my humble opinion we can apply
to arrive at the true merits of this claim.—
It must be borne in mind, that Messrs White & Overton in their
report of this Case, as commissioners of the United States, made an
unfavourable report "thereon, but now the claimants produce a host
of documents, said to be obtained since the report.—But where do
they Spring from? Havanna the residence of Colin Mitchel one of
the Petitioners before the Court.—I am not disposed lay aside the
ordinary Charities which I profess to ascribe to human actions gen-
erally, but Spanish documents of Sudden Concoction, brew" and
brought into esse to day, which ought to have been produced yester-
day, touching and concerning a pretended contract of thirty or more
years, is rather Suspicious to Say the least.—
I find upon examination of their documents, Eighteen of them are
certified as of record from Havanna.—Now Some of them, indeed, the
principal portion of them, might as well have been produced pending
the Commission, as at this crisis.—Why it was neglected, the investi-
gation I am about to Suggest, may possibly lead to an answer, to this
suggestion then I will now call your immediate attention.—
Believing as I sincerely do, from my Knowledge of the Spanish
character, that the documents now on file in this Case, purporting to
be on record at Havanna are not genuine and believing moreover,
from all the Circumstances, that the Officers at Havanna have been
operated upon in this matter, as in most other public duties Confided
to them, the United States cannot safely go into the merits of this
claim, unless they open a commission at Havanna.—It must be borne
in mind, that the Congress of the United States have extended to the
Claimants an unprecedented privelege, placing their claim upon the
very pinnacle of Equity, backed by all the doors that open to every
Species of Foreign evidence—The government then in this aspect of
the case, can only rebut the introduction of improper and evasive

documents, by going to, and prying into the very records from which
they profess to obtain their documentary title—
I propose to open a commission at Havanna, and attend the execu-
tion of it myself.—It may be well to explain, why Mr Brent's the law
Agent will not have it in his power to attend to this matter, though this
gentleman will do So, yet, it will lead to great delay, a consequence
much to be dreaded by the friends and well wishers of this last Southern
offspring of our republic.—
His business at St. Augustine and Pensacola will occupy him the
Coming winter, and he is then desirous of returning home, to arrange
his affairs, So as to attend this Court, and other Courts Early in the
Spring—I would Suggest, that the government procure me letters
from the Spanish minister at Washington, and from such other per-
sons, as would lead to an acquaintance with the influential public
functionaries at Havanna—I would further suggest, that the Consul
and Commercial Agent of the United States be instructed to aid and
give me every facility in his power—I would further suggest, that the
government authorize and instruct me, to employ an intelligent Span-
ish lawyer, to aid me in the investigation, and in the execution of the
Commission—I would further suggest, that the government authorize
me to purchase such Spanish works, as may tend to throw light upon
this Subject—
With this authority I can no doubt bring to light important facts.—
I am informed here, that there is a regular Packet plying between Key
West and Havanna—leaves Key West every other day.—I can reach
Key West from here in one or two ways—either by going via Pensa-
cola, or watch an opportunity from St: Marks by water—The court of
Appeals of this Territory will meet the first monday in Febr January,
and will adjourn in five or Six days.—Immediately after the adjourn-
ment of this Court, I will Set out in the execution of this important
duty, Should my government view it in this light, if not, my mind will
be relieved from the responsibility I apprehend in this Cause.—If the
government Should deem it important, to Send me upon this business,
be pleased to say, I would wish my instructions to be full and clear as
to the extent of my powers, and would not like to act with any discre-
tion, unless under imperative circumstances incident to Such a mis-
sion—I would call your attention to another important fact—The
Petitioners call for 1,200,000.—acres, and I am credibly informed that
the claim will mete 2,000,000 of acres.—I am not apprized from the
present Situation of this Case, whether it will be necessary to order
a Survey of the claim—if I should make up my mind to do So, I will
of course inform the Department.—I would Suggest, that this Com-
munication be referred to the Attorney General, who may be able to

SIR Your letter of the 7" Ulto:” was received last evening—I
regret that Gen" Bernards absence from Washington prevented an
immediate reply to my communication of the 4" of September"—
The time which had elapsed had encouraged the belief, that that letter
had been received as a non-acceptance on my part of the agency for
superintending the improvement of the navigation of the inland
passage between the St Marys and S" Johns Rivers," and that other
arrangements had been adopted for the forwarding a work of so much
importance to the Inhabitants of that part of Florida.—As however
this appears not to be the fact and you still depend upon my services,

(notwithstanding the preliminary examinations of the channel way
to be improved are not more matured than I expected:) I wish to
prevent any further delay in the commencement of operations by our
correspondence, proceed as early as practicable to the S" Johns; make
the examinations of the obstructions at the points designated in the
inland passage proposed to be improved: and prepare a report, as you
request, accompanied with an estimate of the probable cost of their
removal and of the expences to be incurred in carrying on the work
during the remainder of the present year—I will immediately issue
for proposals from those willing and capable of contracting for the
whole or parts of the work to be accomplished, as well from those who
would prefer furnishing labour—So that we may be able to decide on
the most effectual and advantageous mode of conducting the opera-
tions contemplated.—I must confess in a Country like this where
laborers are owned: and where none but the laborers of the country
can be depended on or have been accustomed to the climate that my
preference inclines to the contract system with Responsible Indi-
viduals; adding to the security by making no payments but for work
performed.—
Should I therefore receive offers from Individuals of the description
alluded to I shall proceed immediately to the commencement of the
work, bestowing upon it such occasional personal attention as will
ensure the faithful performance of their contracts.—If however this
be impracticable (of which) you will receive the earliest information,
and the work must be conducted under the immediate direction of the
Governmental Agent as this will require more of my personal attend-
ance than I can possibly bestow: I shall expect to be relieved by some
Officer from your Department, or receive instructions to transfer the
superintendance to some other Individual.—
As I shall at present need funds only to meet the expences of the
preliminary examinations contemplated I will thank you to forward
me to Tallahassee a check on the Bank of New Orleans, or a draft on
the Receiver of Public monies at Tallahassee for 500 dollars.

THE subscriber, being authorized by General Lafayette to dispose
of part of his lands in Florida, will receive proposals for the purchase
of the East or North half at the option of the purchaser, of the Gener-
al’s township of land, which half will contain eighteen sections, of
640 acres each. The terms of sale will be cash, or one fourth in cash,
and the residue in annual instalments, no exceeding four, satisfac-
torily secured, with interest on the amount of each instalment from
the day of sale. This township of land adjoins, at the South West
corner, the city of Tallahassee; and in reference to locality, healthful-
ness of climate, fertility, and adoption of soil to the culture of sugar,
it is excelled by no other township of land in the Territory of Florida.

laws. It is entitled “an act to discontinue certain postroads and to
establish others.” "
By the 19* Section of the post office law you will observe, all
vessels are prohibited, under a certain penalty, from conveying letters
on an established mail route, and by the law of 1823, all waters on
which steam boats regularly ply are to be considered as established
routes.”
If the provision of the 17* Sect. apply as well to coasting vessels,
as to vessels from a foreign port, you at once see there is a conflict
between this provision and that of the 19* Sect. The latter forbids
the conveyance of letters on mail routes, except under a contract
with the P. M. G. authorized by the 5. Sect., while the former author-
izes it. In giving a construction to a statute, every part, if possible,
should be so construed as to be carried into effect. The intent of the
legislature is to be ascertained, by a liberal and fair construction of
the words used throughout the statute. It would seem to be doing
violence to the intention of Congress, to presume that they adopted
conflicting provisions in the 17" and 19" Sections of the law under
consideration, when the language of the 17* Section is susceptible of a
fair construction, which avoids any conflict with the 19* Sect.
The language of the 17* Sect. although somewhat equivocal, would
seem strongly to refer to vessels from a foreign port. On what other
ground can have been the necessity of using the words, “within the
U. States” in the second line. Had the provision been, “that no ship
or vessel arriving at any port where a post office is established, it
would have applied without doubt, as well to coasting vessels as vessels
from a foreign port. But the provision is “that no ship or vessel
arriving at any port” within the U. States shall be permitted &"—
The words “within the U. States” were not designed to be considered
as surplusage or unmeaning, and when the provision of the 19* Sect.
is adverted to, there would seem to be no good ground to doubt, that
the provision of the 17* Section was intended to apply to vessels from
a foreign port, arriving at a port within the U. S. Any other con-
struction of this Section destroys the provision of the 19* Sect. and
authorizes vessels to convey letters on an established mail route, and
on failing to deliver them, the commandants must be prosecuted under
the 17th Sect. From the 18th Sec. the letters delivered under the
provision of the 17* Sect. are clearly considered ship letters, and not
such, on which, inland postage is to be charged.
By a liberal construction of the 5* Sec. all vessels which ply regu-
larly on an established mail route, when conveying letters, are con-
* Approved Mar. 3, 1823, 3 STAT. 765.
*Approved Mar. 3, 1825, 4 STAT. 107.

sidered under an implied contract with the Dept, as post masters are
instructed to received and pay for the conveyance of such letters.
If masters of vessels on a route convey letters and fail to deliver them,
they may be proscecuted under the 19 Sect.
It would be preferable, however, to make contracts with the masters
of vessels, as well those which regularly ply on mail routes" as others,
by which they bind themselves to convey and deliver letters, and the
P. M. G. to pay them, on delivery, either 2 or 3 cents for each letter.
You will observe in my letters to Phil" & N. York, that a charge of
inland postage is to be made, for the distance letters are conveyed
on an established route, but the voyage being continuous, inland
postage can in no case be added to ship letter postage. Any distance
of mail route will authorize the charge of 6% cents postage, which is
the highest rate of ship postage.
Letters on which inland postage is charged when mailed at the
office to which they are delivered, for some other office, to which they
may be directed, should have no additional charge of postage, beyond
what the length of the water and land route authorizes.
The letter of the 29" Oct 1825* to your predecessor on the above
Subject was written, if I mistake not, by a gentleman in the office,
and signed by me, without a full investigation of the Subject, which
I was under the necessity of making, in my correspondence with the
merchants of Phil"—I am not at all displeased at your vigilance and
scrutiny on on this subject. An impression was made by your former
letter, that you had used efforts with the P. M. at New Orleans, to
induce him, to disregard the instructions of the Dept.
According to the above construction, there is no means by which
the commanders of coasting Vessels can be found to deliver letters
in the post office, which have been conveyed on waters, no part of
which is established as a mail route. This would probably be the
case with letters conveyed from Pensacola to Mobile. But, such
places are few in the Union, and post masters have generally been
able to make contracts with the commanders of Wessels, so as to
avoid any loss to the public. It is my intention to present some
modifications of this law to Congress at their next Session.
Persuasive and gentle means are generally found more efficacious,
than harsher modes, for the enforcement of law or instructions; and
I trust, that the small amount of business done at your office, will
not cause greater difficulty than has been experienced, on the above
subject, at the more important Seaports in the Union.

TALLAHASSEE November 26* 1828
SIR. Your communication of the 6" October last requiring me
to furnish an estimate of the expence of this department for the first
quarter of the ensuing year has been received *
The balance of the amount of the appropriation for removing the
obstructions in the Appalachicola Say $1500 will be required perhaps
before the commencement of the next quarter: But if the Govern-
ment contemplate making or rather recommending a farther appropri-
ation for removing obstructions, which possibly may exist in the
Appalachicola River subsequent to the completion of the task I
have undertaken then I would respectfully recommend an appropri-
ation of $10,000 for the removal of permanent (the existing ones
being only casual with the exception of the river of sticks) obstruc-
tions to the navigation of said river, and a present removal of the
casual obstructions to the navigation of the Chipola river, a tributary
of the Appalachicola, and winding its course through a fertile and
already tolerably populous country, all in the Territory of Florida.
If the Department will order me after my work on the appalachicola
* This circular authorized the selection of school lands under the act of May 20,

is completed I will make a reconnaissance of the Chipola river and
that part of the Chattahouchie which runs in the Territory of Florida
and make an estimate of the expense of rendering those rivers com-
pletely navigable at all seasons of the year for Steam Boats. The
above amount would go very far to accomplish this very desirable
object, and I presume the Department are already so well informed
of the immense trade that is bursting forth on these rivers; for a
more general and detailed view of which, I refer you to our able dele-

SIR. Your communication of the 31* October last" was received by
me on the Appalachicola River I have been returned from New
Orleans for 12 days. previous to my departure, I had engaged a Mr
Brown with 10 men and a good Keel Boat to make a commencement
upon that part of the river alluded to in your letter, and on my return
I found he had so far progressed as to make to have taken away about
30 feet of the island and cut off some few of the snags and sawyers
between the island and the point on the West side. I found that the
base of this island is composed of a thick marle upon which the current
when let in upon it makes little or no impression, and that the spade
and mattock will have to be used to a great extent. The navigation

at this place was before he commenced, entirely impeded, and the
experiment of removing the island has so far succeeded as to widen
the aperture and enable a Steam Boat to pass up with some difficulty:
a further excavation and finally an entire removal of this island will
cause this part of the river to be as easily navigated as if there had
never existed any obstruction. I have engaged 10 more hands from
this place and proceed with them tomorrow to the spot, to drive on
the work. I have purchased provisions blocks tackeles axees &ac
chains &ac &ac at New Orleans and have them safe in store on the
river to be used as occasion may require. If the water should rise
of which I am apprehensive on account of the lateness of the season,
I will be under the necessity of removing the men &ac farther up the
river to the next grand obstruction, at the cut off, where they can
work to as great advantage as if the water was low. I shall require
another remittance next month; I have been so employed that I have
not had time to make up the account of amts expended, but will do
it when I return again from the Appalachicola I find that keel boats
are more advantageous than flats would have been, and I therefore
declined building them and have one large and one small keel boat,
which I find more manageable in the swift currents

It is extremely desirable that an office should be established here,
as early as practicable, as the place is rapidly increasing in size &
commercial importance & it is nearly one hundred miles to the nearest
Post office, to which we can have a direct communication.
I have recently learned that a petition has been got up in Jackson
County, by Co." Beveridge and Genl Call, reccommending another
individual as P. Master
If there is such a petition it must have been signed by persons at a
distance, as it has never been presented to a single individual in this
place—I have always understood, that the Post Master Gen' in every
instance expects the applicant to be recommended by the citizens
in the immediate vicinity of the Post office—
Dr White the Collector of this Port has informed me that some

Mr Phelps as Post Master," but Mr. P. does not desire the appoint-

KEY WEST 27 Oct. 1828
MY DEAR SIR, For the last two weeks, I have been a resident of
this Island, & am highly gratified at the prospect it presents of health,
comfort & convenience—no place has ever been more unfairly rep-
resented—so far from its being low & marshy (as I have often heard)
it is precisely the reverse, the Island is formed of a hard limestone
rock, covered with a fine rich mould, from six to twelve inches in
depth, & sufficiently elevated—it is thickly set with evergreen timber
of various sorts & sizes, & beautifully variegated with flowering shrubs
and vines, the harbor is excellent, the breezes fresh & apparently
pure, & tipen the fish abundant & good—upon the whole I think it
a pleasant healthy residence for at least nine months in the year.—
The town is handsomely situated, & contains at present, about six
hundred souls, & will no doubt increase rapidly in size & commercial
importance.— -
Situated as this place is, I think it should in some degree, com-
mand the attention of the Government—From its peculiar location,
it may be made the key to the Commerce of the Gulf of Mexico,
& should be regarded in that light—the causes which lead to so
much fatality, when it was used as a Naval station, have wholly
been removed, & nothing of that sort can now be apprehended.—
While at Washington last winter, I understood that a Company
of troops would be stationed here, in the event of the establishment
of a Court, should it be deemed necessary—As the population of
this place, will always in a great degree, be composed of foreigners
from various Governments, and as such persons are but little ac-
quainted with our habits & customs, & usually form very erroneous
& imperfect ideas of liberty, as found in our Country, I can readily
perceive that a military force may sometimes be necessary to sup-

port the Civil authority—many of these people are of the opinion,
that as soon as they land on our shores, they are at liberty to do as
they please, & it is difficult to learn them, except by punishments,
that restraints can or ought to be imposed in a Country where the
Citizens profess to be free—& to inflict these punishments it may
frequently become necessary to resort to force."—
It is the opinion of all commercial men, (& in which I fully Coin-
cide) that this port should be entitled to the priviledge of drawback,
& should also be allowed to enter vessels & cargoes Coming from
any part of the world; may I beg your attention in a particular
manner to this Subject.—
The Sec: of the Navy, has authorized the Marshal to take posses-
sion of an Old building here formerly erected for a Hospital, fer to
be used as a Court house; the ground upon which the building stands
is private property, but the proprietors of the Island have agreed
to make it over to the Gov" for any length of time for which it may be
used as a court House, provided it shall be repaired in such a way
as shall make it decent & respectable—it needs some repairs before
it can be used, & I think the terms proposed by them, should be
acceeded to, as it will can with much less expense, than will be re-
quired to build another, be made an excellent Court house—it will
also be necessary to erect a Jail, as there is no house on the Island which
can be used for that purpose.—
Let me hear from you at every Convenient opportunity, letters
addressed to the Care of M. Hunt or the Naval agent at Pensacola
will be forwarded to me, or they may be sent through the Commercial
agent at Havanna.
Accept my D’Sir, renewed assurances of regard & esteem from

of Three thousand five hund" acres of land shall be tried before the
District Court of the United States, to comply with which Law a
Sollicitor with a very considerable Fee on the part of the Defendant
is required, and this condition in most Cases would render it impossible
for the claimants in most cases to avil themselves of their Just Rights
for the want of means to maintain a prosecution and Fee suitable

suitable Council may be furnished to them under the aforesaid
circumstances by the Government of the United States and that one

furnished to them to protect their Rights and plead in their behalf
before the tribunal of the United States and your Petitioners will

afford to the establishment on Key West, and to the interests of the
United States—
The position of Key West in a commercial point of view is peculiar—
its immediate vicinity to the Island of Cuba and the West Indies gen-
erally, its lying in the midst of the dangerous shoals and navigation to
the Gulf of Mexico, the various accidents to which the commercial
marine that resort to its vicinity is subjected, and the heterogenious
congregation of individuals of all nations, most of whom unacquainted
with our laws, and by habit respecting only Military force, together
with the late infractions of the law of nations attempted by vessels of
foreign nations, and piratical associations, all seem to offer very strong
reasons for complying with the request of the authorities of Florida,
that a Military post should be established on the Island of Key West—
I would therefore respectfully recommend, that a company of the
Fourth Regiment of Infantry, now stationed in Florida, should be
stationed at Key West, and that suitable arrangements be made during
the present season for erecting quarters, stores, and even for a small
fort or battery of four heavy guns—That the Proprietors of the Island
grant to the U.S. a sufficiency of ground, to be held by the U.S. only
so long as it may be used for Military purposes—
Should you approve of the establishment of a Military post at Key
West, I will loose no time in putting into execution your orders in the
CaSe 21

should consider the establishment of a Land Office at Pensacola as
inexpedient because I do not believe that the annual receipts at an
Office established there would exceed the expences of the Office.
The petitioners seem to have been misinformed on the Subject of
the Laws in relation to Preemption rights. The Law requires that
those claiming a preemption right shall establish such a right and
pay for it previous to the public sale of the adjacent Lands—Whenever
a number of townships are proclaimed for sale the Register & Receiver
of the Land Office where they are to be sold, give public notice to all
persons claiming preemptions within those Townships to come
forward by the time fixed by Law, and establish and pay for the
same. As there is a public sale of Lands to take place at Tallahassee
in the month of January next, the Register and Receiver have I
presume given the usual notice to the claimants of preemption
rights, and it is to that notice the petitioners refer.”

SIR, In one of your official Reports about two years ago, you recom-
mended the opening of a military Road from Pensacola to Blakely,
& to Mobile point,” for which an appropriation would have been
asked if you had not Suggested that it might be executed out of the
Contingent fund—The location, & improvement at the Navy Yard, &
Commencement of the Fortifications, & the recent establishment of
an Arsenal a short distance above Blakely, renders your recommenda-
tion in a Military point of view much more interesting—To this may
be added the recent establishment of a line of Steam boats from
Mobile to New Orleans, & the appropriations to improve the naviga-
tion—This latter consideration however is desirable on account of the
general Convenience & accommodation a good Road would furnish
to all who travel that way—I will take it as a favor if you will in-
form me whether it can be done without a special appropriation &
if not, will you recommend one to the Committee? Comeing under

REPORT OF HOUSE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC LANDS RE
PREEMPTION
[NA:HF, Repts. Comm. Pub. Lands, 20 Cong., 2 sess.: D*]
[December 19, 1828]
Pre-emption to certain Persons in Florida.
No. 9 20th Con. 2d. Sess.
Mr. Isacks. Made December 19. 1828.
The Committee on the Public Lands being instructed to inquire into
the expediencey of granting the right of pre-emption to those per-
sons in Florida, whose improvements were sold in 1825, and those
included in the lands ceded to the Indians, and who would have
been entitled to a pre-emption if the sale and cession had not been
made before the passage of the pre-emption law of 1826
Report:
That by the act of 22d April, 1826,” the right of pre-emption to a
quarter section of land was given to heads of families or persons over
the age of 21 years, who, on or before the 1st day of January 1825,
had actually inhabited and cultivated a tract of land in Florida, and
had not removed therefrom, of which settlement, proof was required
to be made to the Register and Receiver of the Land Offices. But
in may 1825, and before the passage of the pre-emption law, a part
of the public lands in Florida were sold by the United States; and it
appears by a certificate of the Register and Receiver at Tallahassee,
that eight persons had made settlements on the lands which were
sold, who, under said pre-emption law, had the sale not been made,
would have been entitled to a pre-emption in the land they occupied.
These persons in the opinion of the Committee, were equally entitled
to the favor of the Government on account of these early settlements,
with those who did not happen to live on the lands which had been
sold before the privilege of pre-emption was recognized; and as the
best amends which can now be made for the loss of their improve-
ments and the lands they had selected, they ought to be allowed the
privilege of entering an equal quantity of land, at the Government
price, elsewhere.
The testimony on the other branch of the resolution shows that
two persons, namely, Ellis Wood and Mary Downs were actually
settlers, and would have been entitled to a pre-emption, but that the
land on which they lived had been reserved to an Indian Chief, by
the treaty of the 18th of September, 1823. That, by the act of 2d

a bill for that purpose.”

1. The price demanded for the lot upon which the Custom House

2. A suitable lot for the Custom House could not be obtained for a

3. The materials of the present Custom House could not be advan-

advantage.

suitable for $2000, and I would beg leave to recommend this course
to the Department.

The lot offered to the Government is in my opinion well adapted to
the use for which it is intended, and its price extremely reasonable.
I consider it worth $6000, and would recommend that the offer of the
proprietors be closed with. I have forwarded to the Department a
chart of the island of Key West which will shew the situation of the
lot. There is a small Building upon the Custom House lot which
might be disposed of to advantage, and which has been hitherto used
for the boatmen, but as the streets now laid out will interfere with this
house, I beg the Department will authorize its sale
I should have furnished the Department with the information

REG & REC AT TALLAHASSEE. F.
GEN" Your letter of the 26th of October relative to the case of
Mr Michilet, having with the protest of the Corporation of Pensacola
& other papers accompanying it,” been submitted to the Secretary of
the Treasury," I am requested by him to inform you that the Selec-
tion of Mr Michilet of the nineteen acres of land designated on the old
plat of the Town of Pensacola as reserved for the purpose of a “Navy
Yard & watering place for Shipping” cannot be approved.
This decision is not influenced by an opinion that the piece of Land
above referred to, is the property of the Corporation of Pensacola, on
the contrary it is beleived the reservation was made for National, and
not exclusively local objects, but it is given on the ground, that no
Such liberal construction should be given to the Act of May last,” as
would divest the public of a piece of property so long appropriated and
because the fact of its having been so appropriated being immediately
within the knowledge of the Committee who reported the Bill, it
probably might have been one of the reasons which induced the limita-
tion inserted in the Act as to the minimum quantity of land that might
be located by the claimants.—
Mr Michilet's relinquishment is therefore returned to you, and as he
will have to make a different selection it will be necessary for him to
make another relinquishment and that heretofore made returned to
him.
In giving instructions relative to the execution of the Act of 23"
May 1828, nothing was said on the Subject of the relinquishment that
was to be filed with you, as provided for by the 2" Sect. of the Act,
because the law seemed to have left that matter to the judgement &
discretion of the Register & Receiver, and because they were better
acquainted with all those forms which the laws of the Territory re-
quired to give validity to Such an instrument, and it was beleived
that they would take the same measures to Secure the rights of the
Government as if those rights had been their own.—
* NA(GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee), enclosing a protest of the city
authorities of Pensacola against the claim of Henry Michelet to 19 arpents of
land on the western border of the city fronting the bay, which was claimed by the
city as public property and which had been fraudulently obtained by V. S. Pintado
from whom Michelet had derived his title.

The law requires that the relinquishment must be made by “all
the parties in interest” that is of the parties who hold the interest in all
the Lands relinquished. If the original grantee relinquish, he should
show by satisfactory evidence from each Office in which a conveyance
of the Land might be admitted to record, that no Such conveyance was
of record, & if necessary he should be required to make oath that he
was the only party in interest of the Land relinquished.
If the heir, devisee or assignee of the Original grantee make a
relinquishment, he should in addition to the above requisites exhibit
a regular & well authenticated Chain of title, from the original grantee,
to the Lands relinquished. I think it would be proper to have the
relinquishment recorded & the originals or authenticated copies filed

MY DEAR SIR I returned here a few days since, having examined,
as directed,” the inland passage between the S" Marys & S. Johns—
I find that the principal obstruction at the Amelia narrows may be
easily obviated by a short canal from a branch of Belle river to Amelia
sound—The distance by this operation will be shortened nearly 3
miles, and the canal may be dug at an expence not exceeding the
estimate for removing the obstacles in the narrows—I have received
and shall acceede to proposals from a responsible & competent Indi-
vidual to execute the whole work agreeably to my advertisement for
13.500 dollars—
From an estimate made by me I inclined to the opinion that
hired labor under government superintendents, with all the expences
necessary as the preparations of boats, accommodations &c. &c. &c
would bring up the cost to an amount greatly exceeding that Sum—
You may safely calculate that the work contemplated will now be
performed for the estimate & provision only for the contingencies will
have to be made—They cannot possibly exceed 1500 dollars & I
mention this fact to you in time to bring the subject before Congress;
or to embrace it within the contingent expenses of your Department
for the year 1829–The principal item will be for my compensation,
which will vary of course according to the time consumed in executing
the work—
I have received from the Treasury Dep a draft of 500 dollars, but
will thank you for a further remittance of 1000 dollars which will

of the S" Sebastian river—The road appears to me to be one of the
best that the nature of the soil will admit of, and as far as I can learn
is so esteemed by the inhabitants; but the Causeway has been left in
an unfinished state, in consequence of the withdrawal of the Troops
that were at work upon it "–It is L' Browns opinion that the labour
of twenty men for six weeks longer would have brought it to a com-
pletion, but as labourers could not be hired but with great difficulty;
as the orders for a detail from the Garrison here, leave it at the discre-
tion of the Commanding Officer what number he can spare, as never
more than eight seven at a time were furnished under these orders;
after but two or three, and none after the order for the trial of L." Brown
arrived; the work has from that time been entirely suspended—I
would however remark that as this causeway cannot be used when
finished, until the contemplated Bridge has been built, that little or
no injury will result from the present suspension of the work; but that
when resumed it will be important that there should be orders speci-
fying the precise number of men that the Garrison shall furnish.
(say one Serjeant and fifteen men) who when once detailed shall in
no case be changed until the work is finished, except at the request of
the q Master, or for sickness, or crime, in which cases others shall be
immediately detailed to supply their places—
With respect to the Bridge over the S" Sebastians, proposals for the
building of which by Contract have been issued by L" Brown, and a

copy of which is herewith inclosed,” I would remark, that should he
fail in obtaining a reasonable Contract here, yet if the Advertisement
be published in any part of the Middle or Eastern States, describing
the width of the river to be about 310 feet its depth at high water
averaging about 14 feet, that its scite is within half a mile of S"
Augustine, and that the Stehe and Timber may all be obtained within
eighteen miles & the Stone within three miles with very little land
carriage, I have no doubt but that a Contractor with a gang of hands
would arrive and complete the work in less time than it could be done
in any other way—
As to the road from Tamoka to New Smyrna, it appears to be the
general opinion here, that it can be of no service, and will be seldom if
ever used, as it will run through a barrern and often inundated coun-
try, and as there is a navigable river in almost a straight line between
the two settlements—If this be the case, and the road should not be
constantly used, it will soon be grown up & obliterated, at whatever
expence it may be made, reasoning from the road constructed a few
years ago by Cap" Burch from this place to Talahassee, which from
want of use in some places near here, is now hardly to be discerned—

SIR: The Government of the U.S. has been greatly importuned by
the Authorities of Florida and especially by the delegate in Congress,"
as well as by the National Authorities on Key West,” to cause to be
established on that Island a Military Post, to protect the place from
lawless adventurers and to enable the magistracy and the Courts to
carry into effect the laws and decrees.—The Government is disposed
to acceed to their wishes, but before taking any measures of a character
to give permanency to the object; it is desirable to ascertain from the
proprietors, who are much interested in having the troops stationed at
Key West, whether they are willing to release to the United States a
suitable site, for the erection of Quarters and a Battery—You will
therefore proceed to Key West by the earliest opportunity, or send an
Officer, who, may in your opinion be competent to the duty, for the
purpose of consulting with the Authorities at that place, as to the
precise views, which they have in asking for a Military force, the posi-
tion most proper for the establishment of the troops, and works, if
necessary together with the quantity of land that may be necessary
for said purposes, and to obtain from the proprietors the release of the
ground during the continuance of the troops at Key West, or for so
long a period as the said land shall be occupied for Military purposes—
It is expected that the proprietors will make this session without
expense to the U. S. Having made these preliminary arrangements,
you or the officer sent by you, will examine the nature of the soil,
* A memorandum of these sums is present.

whether materials are to be had on the Island for erecting the quarters,
fort or battery: if lime and shells are to be had suitable for making
tapia buildings, or shell-stone that may be employed for that purpose:
whether the position to be selected is a healthy one and if not whether
it is susceptible of being made so by removing the bushes, drawing the
stagnant water and letting in the salt water from the Sea,—You will
also cause to be enquired into all the facts concerning the former
Naval establishment, why it was so unhealthy; if there was a want of
police on the Island at the time, or if it is insuperable from circum-
stances beyond contol—In fine, to make yourself acquainted with
every circumstance and fact relating to the place—as to its Military
advantages, commercial, agricultural, fishing, wrecking, and indeed
every description of advantage, including Naval purposes, and also
all the disadvantages under every point of veiw, especially as to it
Military occupancy—Should the War Department decide upon placing
a force there, it is probable that it will be made a dependency of Tampa
Bay establishment, and consequently one company from that place,
or from the 4th Regt, will be ordered to Key West, so that it may be
reinforced should it be found necessary, and also releived at stated
times should it be judged proper to consider it rather as an out post
than a permanent garrison—It would be as well perhaps, to take the
Surgeon of the post under your command, with you, if you go, yourself
to the Key, if not, to send him with the Officer that you may select
to perform the duties herein directed."
I have the honor to be Sir Your Most. Obt. Servt.

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF KEY WEST
[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 2 sess., DS]
[January 10, 1829]
To the Senate & House of Representatives of the United States.
The memorial of sundry inhabitants of the town of Key West,
would most respectfully represent: that from the increased number
of inhabitants and business of the Island, the establishment of a mail
between this place and the main, would be of the first importance to
them, and it is believed it would be mutually beneficial, particularly
to persons engaged in commerce throughout the United States
* Answered Feb. 10, 1829 (NA, WD, HQA Lets. Recd., M 1828), that he would
repair to Key West immediately and make his report from that island. See Col.
Clinch to the Adjutant General, Aug. 12, 1829 (NA, WD, AGO Lets. Recd., C 150),
advising that Cantonment Clinch should be abandoned and Cantonment Brooke
strengthened if the Fourth Regiment moved to Key West. See also post, p. 503.

Your memorialists believe that the advantages of a Mail from this
place, would be important to the Government in a political point of
View, as frequent and certain communication could then be held with
the West India Squadron] and th[MS. torn "] officers upon the
Island, which at this time is precarious and frequently delayed a
long time after it should have been received.
It is believed a Mail route could be established between this place
and Charleston, to depart twice a month at an expense not exceeding
Two thousand dollars as there are already vessels regularly running
between the two places and there is no doubt the owners would
make a contract upon the most liberal terms, and your memorialists
with great confidence assert, that the amount of Postage received
would be sufficient to defray the expense of the route. The communi-
cation between this place and Havanna is almost invariably effected
in one night, the distance being about seventy miles, and vessels
are regularly coming from thence, about twice or three times a week;
if a Mail route was established from here there can be no doubt, the
merchants of Havana, [MS. torn "] avail themselves of it, in their
communications with the United States, and immense and important
advantages would result to the commercial community, from the
facility and certainty with which information could be obtained
from this important Island.
Your Memorialists therefore most respectfully pray, that you will
afford them all the aid in your power, in the establishment of a Mail
Route between this place and the city of Charleston South Carolina,
or such other place as you may deem most advantageous.

RICHARD C. ALLEN TO DELEGATE WHITE
[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 2 sess.: ALS "]
Tallahassee FLORIDA 12* Jan 1829
HONBe JOs M. WHITE
DEAR SIR, By a resolution of the last Legislative Council, a resolu-
tion, passed at a previous session for my benefit,” is refered to you,
and through you to Congress; That you may understand something
more of the merits of the claim than you can do, from the resolutions
themselves, I beg leave to present for your consideration a few obser-
vations.
The resolutions refered to, you have seen—you will recollect also,
that the first Act of Congress granted for a “Seminary &c two entire
townships," to be located under the directions of the Secretary of the
Treasury, one in the Western, and the other in the Eastern land
District.—The selection of these townships was referd to Gov. Duval,
by Mr Rush in the fall of 1825.”—The Gov. being desireous that the
selections should be made at an early time, and to the greatest ad-
vantage—Urged Maj Lewis * and myself to undertake it, supposeing
from our observation and experience in these matters—our Knowledge
of the situation of the fine lands &c, that we could do more justice
to the Territory than any other persons here—After much hesitation
on our part, and after being much importuned, I verry reluctantly
undertook the locations, and immediately proceeded to the business—
In the winter of 1825-6 Lewis & myself proceeded to the Chippola
Country, where we remained six weeks industriously employed in
traversing that Country, a labour of the most arduous and unpleasant
description.—This examination resulted in the selection of a Town-
ship, which is admitted by all, to embrace a greater proportion of
fine lands, than any other in that section of Country;—By acting
promptly I was enabled to select this township, before the Township
granted to the Deaf & Dumb asylum was located, which prevented
the Agents going into to it for any share of his township.—The pre-
emption law extracted a large portion of the Township refered to.
Subsequently you procured the passage of a law, authoriseing the
location of the remaining Township and the quantity extracted by
preemption claims from the first, to be made in sections.”—The
"Printed also in A. S. P., Pub. Lands, VI, 169–170.
* Present, dated Nov. 20, 1828. See act dated Nov. 21, 1828 (Fla., Acts, 1828,

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 139
Country was extensive and but little known, being entirely unsettled,
except in those parts, where preemption claims covered the good
lands, or at least left vacant but few tracts of a section in a Square
form, that could be esteemed valuable or of good quality—These
circumstances, could not have been anticipated by me, but they added
greatly to the labour, and to the expenses of the undertakeing. I was
aware that the trust was a responsible one, and now I discovered, the
expenses & labour would greatly exceed what I had at first supposed;
and that my only reward would probably be, the ill will, & sometimes
abuse, of persons, who wished to purchase lands, which I thought it
my duty to select, beside seriously affecting my interest in other
respects—Often have I repented most, heartily the engagement, but
was urged to continue.—I have frequently gone, with a party of hands
employed & paid by myself—with pack horses provissions and camp
equipments, prepared to remain several weeks, for the purpose of
makeing selections for the seminary, my expenses were necessarily
verry considerable.—I can at any time, convince any impartial mind
that I will be greatly looser by the business, if the two sections are
secured to me, as contemplated by the first resolutions to convince
you of the correctness of this statement, it will be sufficient to remark,
that many tracts have been selected & reserved by me, which I could
have purchased without competition, and sold again, almost immedi-
ately at from four to six dollars per acre, many instances have occurred
in which it would have been attended with no difficulty.
Your Knowledge of this Country, and the seattered dispersed
manner in which the fine lands are scattered over its face, the labour
and dificulty attending a close & minute examination, so as to obtain
the best lands will enable you to appreciate my services.
I believe that it is conceded by every one, that the lands reserved
are the verry best that could have been obtained and that probably
no other person in the country, could have done the Territory more
justice. Nor is it objected, that the two sections is an extravegant
allowance, but the Idea is, that the land itself ought not to be appro-
priated in this manner, and that the government of the U. States
ought to pay all expenses of location, because, the law directs, that
the locations shall be made under the directions of the Sect” of the
Treasury. I cannot believe however, that Congress can be persuaded,
that the Gov" are is properly chargeable with such expenses.—It
appears to me that the expense of selecting &c, is justly and fairly
chargeable against the land itself.—The Govt. granted for a specific
object, two townships of land, to be “located” &c, upon any lands
not otherwise appropriated &c, Now, until these lands are selected
in persueance of the act, the grant is not complete, it no where attaches,

it is not available. To perfect the grant, an after act is necessary, the
performance of which will be attended with necessary & unavoidable
expenses. There is no provission by the grantee for the payment of
such expenses, certainly under such circumstances the property when
granted obtained should be charged therewith. All the states which
have received similar grants, have paid for locating &c. The case is
simply this, a verry laborious, troublesome and expensive service has
been performed, to the entire satisfaction of those, who held the
supervision and direction thereof, and of all others, who have taken
the trouble to examine for themselves. Indeed none have complained.
These services were expended performed and these expenses incurred,
to perfect or render complete, that which was before imperfect &
incomplete, by them, it is admitted, that it has been done, in an
advantageous & satisfactory manner—What then, is more equitable
& just, than that the same grant should be charged with all necessary
expenses, and a fair compensation for services, by which it has been
greatly increased in value—And what could be more unjust, than to
detain from me a just & equitable allowance for services, and a
restoration of moneys necessarily expended in the performance of
that service.—I put it to your unbiased judgement, whether, upon
every principle of justice I have not a right to demand of the grant,
or property itself, such compensation—Then as to the reasonableness
of the allowance made in the first resolution. I will remark, that none
of the members thought the allowance too great, several of them have
informed me, that they would give me a statement to that effect and
that they were fully convinced that the two sections would be quite
moderate enough.—Their value has been greatly exagerated in a
piece signed Junius, which I suppose you have seen—I would say the
value as he gives it, is at least double that which could be obtained in
any reasonable time if ever. Maj. Adair * has been here and wit-
nessed the progress of this business—And to him I beg leave to refer
you for the correctness of matters of fact stated above. Should you
concur in the view of the matter taken above, I hope you will interest
yourself for me, and obtain the Act of Congress contemplated by the
first resolution. I hope you will excuse this, it was written in much
haste—Maj. Adair can tell all the news &C."

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF MAGNOLIA
[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[January 12, 1829]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled,
The Petition of the Undersigned Merchants, and Citizens of the
Town of Magnolia, Territory of Florida, respectfully Sheweth: That
your Memorialists having noticed the introduction of a Bill before
your honorable body for the establishment of a Port of Entry at Fort
St Marks," and desirous that, -for the common benefit of the Coun-
try, and in consequence of advantages which your Memorialists
humbly conceive Magnolia to afford, for such an object,—it may be
located here; beg leave to present the following facts:—
Magnolia is situated at the head of navigation upon the river St
Marks,—nine & an half miles, in a direct line, and fourteen by the
course of the river, from the Gulph of Mexico: and five and an half
miles N. N. E. from Fort St Marks. The Appalachee Bay, at a point
called “Spanish hole” (five miles below Fort St Marks and Thirteen,
by water, from Magnolia) affords a good harbour from all winds and
safe anchorage for vessels drawing fourteen feet of Water—where they
may safely discharge or take on board Cargoes, by means of lighters,
which are kept at Magnolia for that purpose. Between “Spanish
hole” and Fort St Marks, the navigation is obstructed by Oysterbeds,
so that vessels, drawing more than Eight feet, cannot ascend the
river to that place, in ordinary tides, without lightening. The same
draught of water may also be brought up, in ordinary tides, to Mag-
nolia. With spring tides (that is, tides which occur upon the full
and change of the moon,) Eight and an half to Nine feet may be
found up to St Marks, and, under the same circumstances, nearly
the same depth to the town of Magnolia. By reference to an official
Certificate of the Surveyor of the Port of St Marks (accompanying
this memorial)*—to which your Memorialists respectfully invite
your attention, it will be seen that, since the establishment of the
town of Magnolia, and several commodious warehouses therein, the
greater part of the Shipping arriving at the Port of St Marks finds its
way to the former, notwithstanding the location of the Surveyor
* S. 64, introduced Jan. 21, 1828, passed the Senate Mar. 7, 1828 (Senate
Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 106, 211), but failed of passage in the House (House
Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 388, 396, 459). Another bill (S. 25) was intro-
duced in the Senate, Dec. 16, 1828, but on Jan. 6, 1829, was ordered to lie on the
table (Senate Journal, 20 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 35, 39, 60, 65). See post, p. 152.

and his office at the latter. Of 1422 Tons shipping that arrived at
Fort St Marks from June to December (1828) inclusive (after having
deducted from the amount of tonnage entered, the sum of 105, the
burthen of a Brig which unloaded below St Marks, and whose Cargo—
was transported in lighters above Magnolia to Rock Haven,) it
appears that 1052 Tons passed up to Magnolia, while 370 remained
at St Marks. A part of that number consisted of transient vessels,
touching on the way to other ports in the Gulph. Upon the estab-
lishment of the City of Tallahassee it became necessary for the
Merchants and Traders of that place to fix upon some point, accessible
to shipping, as a general depôt. St Marks was, then, the only place
known to them as affording the immediate facilities they required.
Since the settlement of Magnolia, -within a period of Eighteen
Months, the Merchants and Traders of Tallahassee, or those of them,
at least, not having Storehouses at St Marks, have found it advisable
to receive their goods, for homeward transportation, at Magnolia,
and also to send articles of produce collected in the course of their
business to the same place for shipment. As a prominent advantage
to justify such a preference, it might be mentioned that the distance
from Tallahassee to St Marks is 23 Miles, while to Magnolia it is
seventeen, -creating a difference of some importance in the expense
of land transportation, and that the road leading from St Marks to
Tallahassee (or several miles of it near St Marks where it is overflown
by the tides) always bad, is, at times, almost impassable by loaded
teams; while that from Magnolia to Tallahassee, being upon more
elevated ground & beyond the reach of tide water, has been usually
good, and is better capable of improvement at but little expense.
An evidence of the advantage of transporting goods, destined for the
interior, from some point higher up the river than St Marks, may be
found in the fact that two vessels within the last six months, having
goods for the interior, have discharged their Cargoes below S*Marks
into Lighters, for the purpose of having them carried to Rock Haven,
Seven Miles above Magnolia, beyond which there is a Boat navigation
only.—Besides many local advantages, Magnolia is the nearest point,
enjoying like facilities of navigation and trade, to an extensive &
fertile region of Country, lying in a North East direction and bordering
upon the Mikasukie Lake: A section of Country which sends already
the whole of its production of Sea Island & Upland Cotton to this
place for shipment: and is believed that from Two to Three Thousand
Bales will be shipped hence during the present Season. But the most
important staple of that and other portions of this Territory will be
found to consist in the article of Sugar, for which the planters through-
out Middle Florida are known to be preparing to grow upon a great
scale. Sugar is an article that must find its way to the nearest

navigable water. That place for Nine Tenths of the land adapted
to the culture of the cane in Middle Florida is Magnolia.
Your Memorialists will further state that Magnolia, at this time,
contains a population of 300 Souls, and has Twelve Mercantile Houses,
engaged in extensive business in the sale of goods and the purchase
and shipment of the products of the Country: a number not inferior
to that of any other Sea port within the Territory.
The Town of Magnolia owns seven sail of vessels, measuring Five
hundred Tons; and it is worthy of remark that but one other vessel
is owned within the Apalachicola District—a Sloop of about 35 Tons,
half of which is owned at Apalachicola, the other half at Tallahassee.
Fort St Marks contains Twenty Inhabitants, including Fishermen
& Pilots. The place is deemed so unhealthy that, of the few residing
there, several are making arrangements to remove: and it is usually
almost deserted during the summer months. Should your honorable
Body deem it advisable to establish a Custom House at that place,
the Officer charged with its duties must necessarily reside at Magnolia
a part of the Year.
The Location of Magnolia is such as to warrant the belief that it
will continue healthy:—situated upon a pine bearing soil, of sufficient
elevation, and supplied with wholesome water.
Your Memorialists deem it the most eligible and central point for
the meeting of the great agricultural and shipping interests; and con-
fidently trust that your honorable Body will deem it advisable, should
a Custom House be established upon the river, to direct that its
location be at Magnolia.
And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray

DEAR COLO I send you herewith the opinion of Judge Bracken-
ridge in the cases of Robinson & Gregory " presenting the long liti-
gated questions as to the right of the settler to take his preemption in
two eights instead of an entire quarter & of two settlers on the same
quarter to take each an adjoining quarter so as to secure his improve-
ment. Owing to a doubt in the minds of some of the Court as to
their power to issue a mandamus cases were postponed to next Court.
In regard to the first question not a doubt was entertained by the
Court it was considered clear & unquestionable, as to the second there
seemed to be a division, Judge Smith not having made a settled opin-
ion & Judge Randall refusing to consider it because of his opinion
as to the powers of the Court. In any event however there could
be but a division of the judges thus Judge Woodward & Brackenridge in
favor of the applicant Judge Smith (supposing his opinion made up)
& Judge Randall against it."
To the settlers it is most important that this question should be
determined the one way or the other, many of them are desirousto
sell & all are anxious to have their patents. There is only one appli-
cant for the benefit of the 3/8" law who is Colo Robinson there are
about 50 claiming the right to enter in 8" So is it not better for the
Gov' to terminate a controversy of such little interest by giving up
the point or if not submit the matter to the Atto. Gen' to be decided
by him. It is however submitted to your discretion to take the best
means of effecting our wishes.
There is another subject to which I would ask your attention.
There are some cases of preemption claims above Ellicotts line &

SIR A large party of Indians are now with me on buisness Holata
Emathla one of the chiefs named in G. Humphereys letter of Octor

few chiefs present did assent on their part to send out some of their
people to look at this new country spoken of by the agent. He also
states that the great majority of the chiefs have not been consulted
and that the nation is not apprisd of the matter, It is my opinion that
we shall have much more difficulty than the Department, could an-
ticipate from the Agents letter, and I am decidedly of opinion if a
party of the chiefs are invited to Washington, and I can meet them
many difficulties will be surmounted "-The chiefs request that their
annuity for the present year may be remitted as early as possible,
and my advice is that they be paid here, when I can explain to them
any objects & inforce the views of the Government on such subjects
as you may deem necessary & proper, If a deputation of the chiefs
should be allowed in that case they will take their departure from this

Relative to the disposition of the Indians to remove from Florida—
proposes that a deputation be invited to Washington—Much
anxiety has existed in Florida to rid the Territory of the Indians
within it. The condition of the Indians would seem, apart from all
the wishes & sufferings of the Citizens by their means, alone, to
demand that all measures likely to effect the object of removal be
adopted. For myself I have never doubted the readiness of the
Seminoles to leave Florida. The Gov" in its negotiations on the
subject, has been met always by obstacles. I believe if five of the
principle Chiefs were invited on here, the work might be done. The
efforts & expenditures of the past authorize this movement, & the
Citizens of Florida press it—whilst the abject & suffering condition
of the Indians appear to demand it. I Respectfully recommend it.

SIR In obedience to your instructions after giving due notice to the
parties concerned we proceeded to examine the contested preemption
cases referred to us for further consideration. No evidence was
produced against any other claim than that of Peter W. Guatier
Senior, N° 99 and in the absence of further testimony we have no
reason to alter the decision before given in those cases. The evidence
produced on this occasion against the claim of P. W. Guatier, Sen"
fully sustains the opinion heretofore given by the Register & Receiver,
that the claimant continued to be a citizen of the State of Georgia
until long after the passage of the Act granting preemptions. He
came to Florida in 1822 And located his negroes on the Land which he
claims, he improved a large plantation which he has continued to

cultivate ever since. He visited this plantation frequently and some-
times remained two or three weeks. It was never his permanent
residence until after the passage of the Act under which he claims it
cannot therefore be said that he “actually inhabited & cultivated” this
land prior to the 1" day of January 1825, there were few settlers in
that Section of Country whose cultivation was so extensive as that of
the claimant. If the equity of the Claim can be considered we are of
the opinion that it should be confirmed. How far we are authorized
to depart from the Strict letter of the Law, and decide on equitable
rights is a matter of some doubt, and we therefore refer it to the
department to determine if the claim shall be allowed or not—
The cases arising under the mandamus of Judge Woodward were
brought before the Court of Appeals at the last term, but the Court
entertaining a doubt on the subject of jurisdiction has postponed its
decision until the next session when we entertain no doubt the decision
of Judge Woodward will be reversed.”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF THE
MIDDLE DISTRICT
[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[Referred February 16, 1829]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled.
The memorial of the undersigned, inhabitants of the Middle Dis-
trict of the Territory of Florida, respectfully represent, that your
memorialists, identified with the interest and prosperity of this section
of Country, have heard, with the deepest concern and regret, that a
Port of Entry is to be established at Magnolia, on the river S*Marks.”
Your memorialists hope, they may not be considered officious or dis-
respectful, when they endeavour to shew, the inconvenience and in-
jury which must result from the adoption of this measure, and while
they demonstrate the superior advantages of St: Marks, as the com-
mercial depot of Middle Florida, this demonstration will be the more
easily effected, by a reference to the map, herewith presented,” and
to which your memorialists beg leave to call your attention. Situated
at the confluence of the rivers S*Marks and Wakulla, with an open
exposure to the gulf, from which it is not more than ten miles distant,
S*Marksisequally accessable byland and by sea. It is the highest point
to which, vessels drawing more than eight feet water, can be navi-
gated, and from thence, to all the rich settlements of the interior,
highways have been, or may be constructed.
By the removal of a few obstructions, which may be accomplished
with little labor and expense, the river St: Marks would afford a safe
and convenient navigation, from the ocean to the village of S’ Marks,
for vessels, drawing ten feet water. At present, all vessels of a greater
draft than eight feet, are compelled to anchor in the bay, at a distance
of eight miles from S' Marks, from whence, their cargoes are trans-
ported in lighters or small boats, to the warehouses at S*Marks. The
expense, delay and inconvenience, attendant on this mode of trans-
porting the articles of import and export of this country, is already
sufficiently embarrassing, but how greatly must that embarrasment
be augmented, when the port of entry shall have been established at
Magnolia, a distance of eight miles farther in the interior, than S*
Marks? and which is approached by a contracted, rapid and serpen-
tine stream, presenting Continued difficuly and delay to the enter-
prising mariner? Wessels drawing more than six feet, cannot in the
ordinary stages of the river, ascend to Magnolia, and from this point,
to its confluence with the Wakulla, the river is confined within such

narrow limits, that none but vessels of the very smallest class, are
enabled when they have arrived at their place of destiny, to turn
about, for the purpose of descending, and are most frequently com-
pelled to drop down the stream, stern foremost, until they arrive
near S Marks. When the difficulty and delay, attendant on the
ascending and descending the river, to and from Magnolia, is con-
sidered, it must be evident, that every article delivered at that place,
must be charged with an additional expense to the importer and con-
sumer, as the freight of every vessel will be regulated, by the time
necessary for the completion of her voyage, and the obstacles which
are presented to its accomplishment. The inconvenience and impro-
priety of placing the custom House and the revenue Officers at a dis-
tance so remote from the sea board, must be manifest, to every ob-
server. It exposes the mariner to unnecessary trouble and delay, it
exposes the merchant to hazard, and it exposes the revenue to loss
and depredations, affording facilities to smuggling.
The security of the Revenue, and the advancement of Commerce,
mutually demand, that the Custom House should be established at
that point, where communications by land and sea are most easily
accomplished; and your memorialists hazard nothing in the assertion,
that there is no position, between the Apalachicola and the Suwannee
rivers, a distance of more than two Hundred miles, so well calculated
for commercial purposes, as the port of S’ Marks.
Your memorialists would further, most respectfully suggest, that
their interest as well as that of the United States, would be mate-
rially advanced, by causing the public land, within and adjacent to
the Fortress of S* Marks, to be laid out in Town lots, and Exposed
to sale at public auction.” Your memorialists are aware, that an
objection may be urged to this measure, in consequence of this prop-
erty being situated within the limits of the grant to Forbes & Co.,
but as neither the Government of Spain, from which this grant, if
any, eminated, or the Government of the United States, have sanc-
tioned or confirmed a grant to individuals for the public domain,
within the limits of a Fortress, or within One Hundred feet from its
wall on the Exterior (and in most instances, not within one mile from
a Fortress), your memorialists believe, there would be little hazard,
in thus far disposing of the public property.
If it should be said, that this fortress may be required for the future
defence of the Country, your memorialists would reply, that the fort,
and its appendages, are already in a state of ruin and dilapidation,
and if it were in complete repair, it would be inadequate to the end

proposed. From, its structure, it must have been originally designed,
as a defence alone against Indian assaults, and must, at all times,
have yielded to the attack of those Experienced in civilized warfare.
Even the position, is no longer important for military purposes, as
the settlements have already extended in advance of it on the West-
ern margin of the bay, and an invading enemy, might land at the
entrance of the harbour, and penetrate the interior of the Country,
without receiving the smallest annoyance from the Garrison of S*
Marks. If it be the intention of the Government, as we hope it is,
to give protection to this portion of our sea board, it will be neces-
sary to assume and fortify a position, at or near the entrance of the
bay. Wherefore, your memorialists pray, that the public ground,
within the Fortress of St Marks, and from One Hundred feet from
its wall on the Exterior, be laid out in Town lots, and exposed to
sale at public auction.
And your memorialists further pray, that the port of entry, about
to be established at Magnolia, be abolished, and that it be removed
to, and established at S*Marks, and your memorialists will ever pray

they have lived for several years, expended much labor and great

question was vested in the United States That this beleif should

and prosperity of many of the families of the undersigned rest upon
the issue of the question. Considerations like these and others of a
similar character naturally growing out of the subject, justify the
undersigned in the request which is now made of your Excellency—
that you would be pleased to appoint additional Counsel to assist the
district attorney and Law Agent already appointed. Should this not
be commensurate with the powers vested in Your Excellency, they
would respectfully solicit that they may be authorized on their own

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U STATES.
SIR, I submit two communications from the District Attorney of
Middle Florida,” which were heretofore submitted to the Executive
but not having been acted upon it would seem to be important that
some immediate measures should be taken on the subject. And I
would take the liberty of suggesting the propriety of the employment
of assistant Counsel in the cases of Forbes and Arredondo, with au-
thority issuing from the Dept. of State, to go to the Havanna, and
require that the originals of all papers in relation to lands granted
by the Spanish Authorities in Florida should be given up, and in
particular such papers as related to the land claimed by Forbes &
C° and Arredondo.—
The Counsel thus employed should also be instructed to take all
proper and necessary measures to counteract those which the claim-
ants are represented to have taken at Havanna for the purpose of
establishing their claims.
The papers herewith enclosed and marked from no 1 to no 4.
show the measures which have heretofore been taken by the President
in relation to the appointment of assistant Counsel, under the provi-
sion of the 11th Sect. of the Act approved the 23" May 1828,” by
which it will appear that the duties of that Officer does not extend
to the two cases above mentioned."

WASHINGTON CITY 13th March 1829
SIR. During the last Session of Congress a memorial of the in-
habitants of the Middle District of Florida,” was Sent to the Dele-
gate praying that a portion of the publick ground at and near the
Fortress of S’ Marks might be laid of in Town Lots, and exposed to
Sale at Publick Auction. What attention was paid to this memorial
I am uninformed, but believing that the Land Department is vested
with ample power to carry this plan into execution, if approved, and
knowing the deep interest which is felt on this Subject by the People
of Florida, I am induced to present it to your consideration. S"
Marks is the commercial Depot of Middle Florida. The imports and
exports to and from this point are already considerable, and are in-
creasing with great rapidity. The right to this property yet remain-
ing in the Government individuals are prevented from making the
improvements necessary for the conveniences of commerce. If a few
acres of land was laid of in Town lots and exposed to market at the
approaching land Sales, they would bring a considerable Sum of
money, and would contribute greatly to the convenience and pros-
perity of our Country. Allow me to Solicit your attention to this
interesting Subject.

SIR. The undersigned inhabitants of the County of Alachua, having
heard that strong efforts are making to prejudice the Government
of the U. S. against its Agent for Indian affairs in this territory.
Col. G. Humphreys, & as we beleive with a view to effect his removal

thereby & not with a Single eye to the public good—the only motive
which the undersigned conceive could justify an attempt like that
thder under consideration against a public officer—beg leave to
state that an acquaintance of many years with Col Humphreys during
the time he has been in the discharge of the duties as Indian Agent,
has enabled us to form a correct estimate of the principles which
have governed him in the discharge of those duties; Some of us have
narrowly Scrutinized his conduct in relation to our Indian affairs

intercourse because we had heard his policy condemned & his motives

that however we may have been at times disposed to eensttre censure
his proceedings, are nevertheless Satisfied his course has been correct
& his policy in the management of our Indian relations judicious,
and based upon justice. & having a tendency to place their relations
upon a footing of permanent friendship: Under these circumstances
we cannot, but anticipate his removal his—Pemeval as an evil to be
deprecated & therefore beg leave respectfully to request that it may
not take place. We have good reason to beleive that if the Services
of Col: Humphreys in his present capacity are continued, the final
emigration of the Seminole Indians out of Our Territory (an event
so much to be desired by the Inhabitants of this County, most of
whom reside in the immediate vicinity of the Indians) may in a
short time be effected. We know that his influence with the the
Indians has been already. to a considerable extent successfully exer-
cised upon that Subject & it is confidently Supposed by us, that if
Suitable encouragement is given to his effort, they will eventually
lead to a perfect accomplishment of this all important object. The
undersigned donot intend to place themselves in the light of champions
to Col. Humphreys & must not be so considered, as we are actuated
in making this communication solely with a desire to further the
cause of Justice & premate promote the public good.

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of

the Treasurers draft for the amount apecified.
You inform me that my accounts still remain in your Office, waiting
the transmission of the work upon which the payments have been
made—I am aware of this circumstance and regret most sincerely that
the reiterated orders from the Department for the Surveys of the
private claims West, have rendered this delay indispensibly necessary,
of which I informed you" when I received your last letter of instruc-
tions on that Subject.” To have made out and transmitted the work
before the Surveys were closed, would have subjected this office the
second time to the formation of a large portion of it, which I never for
one moment apprehended was the wish of the Department; more
particularly as I informed you that the third Survey would prevent me
from reporting the previous work until a final return should be re-
ceived in the Office—this is about to be effected in a few days and you
shall be put in possession of the entire work as Soon as practicable.
On the Subject of examinations of Surveys in comparision with the
field notes before payments are made, such has been the uniform
practice of this Office heretofore and they Shall meet with a more
critical examination hereafter.

advice of the attorney general & regret that he was so situated that
I could not obtain it, this claim embraces some of the best sugar lands
in the Territory and will be prosecuted with zeal and ability propor-

pilation of Spanish laws &c. will be published and ready for dis-

Some of the Co" constituents in this quarter have taken umbrage
at his being engaged as assistant supposing that he is to appear in
court against the claimants to lands.”—I understand that his duties
under that appointment extended no farther than to the making
of the compilation above mentioned & that having been finished
that he has nothing more to do as assistant counsel if it would not be
inconsistent (or interfere too much) with your duties, you would
do me a very particular favour by informing me specifically what the
nature of Col Whites engagement as assistant counsel was and the
duties (all the duties) he was bound to discharge under it.—he has
been faithful & indefatigable in the discharge of his duties as Delegate
& has represented us ably in Congress, he is now before the people
for reelection, and I think that not only the people of this Territory
but of the general government would lose much by his defeat our
Congressional election takes place on the first monday in May next
you will therefore perceive the importance of an immediate com-
munication on this subject if you should feel willing & at liberty
to make one.”
I am Sir with great Consideration yours &c

of lands in her colonies, together with a long letter dated Feb. 4, 1829, in which
he recounted the origin and progress of his labors connected therewith. The
signed copy of White's letter and one by the President, Feb. 11, 1829, presenting
the letter of White and a descriptive list of the documents on deposit in the
Department of State, are in NA (HF, Orig. Mess. Pres., 20 Cong., 2 sess.). The
foregoing letters, the list, and the documents are printed in H. Doc. 121, 20 Cong.,

DEAR SIR: You will probably remember to have been informed by
his Excellency the Governor of Florida, that at his instance, I had
been induced to undertake the location of two Townships of land
granted by Congress for a Seminary of learning in the Teritory of
Florida." There yet remains about fifteen sections to be selected,
a few of which I feel it my duty to locate upon some small Islands,
lying East of the entrance of the Suwannee River which have not
been surveyed. The Islands are small, & cannot become valueable
except for Temporary residences and fisheries; but good lands are
scarce, and I do not believe selections can be made of more value to
the Teritory than those Islands may prove. They are unclaimed and
it will be impossible in some instance to connect the Islands with the
main land in the survey, as they are not in view. I am determined,
because I think it my duty, to select to the amount of one two or
perhaps three sections on those Islands I wish therefore to be informed
whether locations by special calls in such case will be allowed. I

GEORGE GRAHAM Esquire Commr Gen' Land Office
SIR I observe that an appropriation has been made to defray the
expense of surveying the private land claims in Florida * & I beg
leave to suggest that it is of importance both to the Goverment and
to the claimants that the surveys should be made as soon as possible
great difficulties exist with respect to claims the boundaries of which
are undefined & particularly with the donation claims which are
generally for 640 acres each some of the claimants wish to cut off
the valuable timber others to build and make improvements on their
claims but do not know where to begin or by what rule the Surveys are
to be governed, a man for instance (& such or similar cases are not rare)
has a donation for 640 acres his improvement is at the end of a narrow
but good hammock of live oak now must he take his 640 acres in a
square with his improvement in the center or may he make it of what
width he pleases & run up the hammock for quantity I think he should
take it in a square, but they are not generally satisfied to do that, but
adopt the latter principle and some of our County Surveyors when
called to survey these tracts make it a point to run the lines in that
manner which will best suit the interest of the claimant regardless of
that of the goverment, this is certainly wrong but it will be difficult to
correct the evil untill the general public survey is made The agent of
the Unit[ed] States for the preservation of the public timber in Florida
complains much of the difficulties which he has to encounter from
these indefinite claims it is hoped they will soon be removed.—I wrote
you by last mail requesting amongst other things to be informed

It now becomes necessary to act upon this—The District Attorney
of East Florida, has transmitted to this office certain documents
relating to the claim of Arredondo & Son and others, to a tract of
land in that territory, on which he asks advice.” The Court sits in
Augustine, on the first Monday in May, and it will consequently
be desirable that no time should be lost in providing Counsel to
represent the United States in this matter—
I beg leave to suggest that as cases of this sort will probably occur
frequently, it may be of importance that some professional gentleman
in this vicinity should be selected to prepare the cases for trial on the

No 33, 1"April 1829
THO" DOUGLASS Esq.r Dist Atty U.S. S." Augustine
SIR, Owing to professional engagements contracted by Mr Berrein
before his appointment as Attorney General, the case of Arredondo,
among others, has been placed by the President under my direction,
and I proceed, at his desire, to answer your letter of the 4th February,”
which, with the accompanying documents, has been handed over to
me for this purpose.
Your answer is so full and so judiciously drawn, that it leaves very
little for me to suggest in the way of amendment. There are a few
points, however, to which I should be glad to call your attention, and
which you will please to consider not as substitutes for any ground
taken in your answer but as additional and supplemental thereto
1 It is left questionable by the recitals in the Supposed grants
whether Arredondo did not represent himself and family as settled on
the lands in question, before the grant: it is possible that the meaning
of the recital is that he was settled with his family in East Florida,
merely, and not on the land. If, however, the representation was that
he was settled with his family on the land, and the fact were not so, it
ought to be directly denied, and relied on as a misrepresentation which
should avoid the grant.
2. It is very clear from the recitals in the grant, that the land was
representated to the Spanish Intendent as vacant, having been
abandoned by the Indians who had formerly occupied it, and that it
was upon this representation that he declared the lands to be crown
lands and granted them to Arredondo & Son if, indeed, the grant be a
genuine one; whereas I am told that they were not vacant nor aban-
doned by the Indians, but on the contrary that they had constantly
been and still were occupied by the Indians at the date of the alleged
grant. General Call, who is here, and is, also, engaged in this case,
supposes that the Surveyor, Pintado, could never have gone actually
upon the lands, so as to qualify himself to support this representation
of the petition which led to the grant, but whether he did or not, he,
Gen' Call, understands this representation to have been false in point
of fact—If so, I should deem it advisable that the answer should
recite this misrepresentation and take the ground distinctly that if
the grant did proceed from competent Spanish Authority (which you
will still deny) it was fraudulently and surreptitiously obtained by
imposing on the Spanish authorities a false representation of facts
and as it would have been cancelled by the Spanish Sovereingn on
* See ante, p. 168, n.


## p. 179 (#193) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 179
that ground, so it may be cancelled by the Sovereign authority of the
U.S, and that a Court of equity cannot, consistently with the prin-
ciples which govern that tribunal, lend its aid to give effect to a grant
obtained by fraud and misrepresentation
3. The alleged order of Ramizes, extending the time for commencing
the settlement for one year more, is said to have been made on the 2"
Dec 1820.—I should think it advisable that the answer should treat
this order as equivalent to an original grant and, therefore, as void, not
only for the want of original powers in Ramizes to have made such a
grant, but because made at a time when according to the treaty of
cession the grants of Spain were no longer to be respected, and made,
therefore, in violation of the treaty—See the 8th article of the treaty
of cession
4- I should think it proper to insist in the answer that the long
fixed and settled policy of Spain was to parol out her colonial domain
with reference to the single object of population, and that, according
to that policy, grants for the purpose of speculation, were not tolerated:
that the rule which required the settlement to commence within three
years, did not contemplate a mere formal commencement, which
should open the lands immediately to speculation in the hands of the
grantee, but a fair and bona fide commencement to be followed up
and completed with all reasonable diligence; whereas, in the present
instance, it is manifest from the shewing of the Petitioner, themselves,
that the purpose of Arrendondo and Son in obtaining this grant (if it
ever was obtained) was, in direct contravention of the settled policy
of the Spanish Crown, for the purpose of Speculation and sale: that if
anything like a settlement was ever attempted by Arredondo & Son
within the time limited by the grant (which ought to be denied) it
was a mere colour and shew of a commencement, for the purpose of
proceeding at once to their leading and paramount object of Specula-
tion, as will be manifest from the dates of the several deeds set forth
with the petition
5—You have said in your answer that there was nothing in the cir-
cumstances set forth in the petition to absolve Arredondo and Son
from a compliance with that condition of settlement on which the
validity of the grant was to depend: I concur entirely with you in this
position—I would have added that as the grant itself, upon that
express condition, was the Act of a Sovereign, it was not a matter for
judicial enquiry whether any circumstances had arisen to excuse a
compliance with that condition, but that it was competent only to the
Sovereign who had imposed the condition, to release it, or to excuse a

non compliance with it: and now to the Sovereign power of the US
who have taken, under the treaty, the place of Spain.
6–It would seem from the evidence before the board of Commis-
sioners in the case of Levy,” a purchaser under Arredondo & Son,
that this was not the only grant which Arredondo had received in
EFlorida from the Spanish Intendant, but that there had been a
previous grant or grants to him. Whereas I understand that, accord-
ing to the Spanish regulation, the petitioner was required to take an
oath that he had received no previous grant—The correctness of this
conjecture will, I understand, soon be tested by an Agent who will be
sent by the Government to Havana to examine the Spanish Archives
with reference to this and other subjects of enquiry. Should the
fact turn out to be as I have supposed, it will be proper to introduce
this fact into your answer as a new and distinct grounds for avoiding
the last grant on the ground of fraud and imposition on the Spanish
Authorities
There will be no difficulty in your obtaining leave to withdraw the
original answer, and file a new one in which you can incorporate, at
the proper places in your former answer, the suggestions which I have
made: or if the withdrawing your former answer should be objected
to, you can, without doubt, have leave to file a Supplimental answer
taking these new grounds.
I would recommend that you move for an order on the petitioner to
file all the original papers on which he relies, for the purpose of ascer-
taining by inspection the genuiness of those papers and the modes of
authentication and, among other things whether they be rubricated
according to the Spanish forms and in what books belonging to the
Spanish Archives they have been registered and recorded: this latter
clue ought to be in the hands of the agent who visits the Havana
Among the papers which ought thus to be filed should be the petition
of Arredondo & Son for this grant for the purpose of ascertaining more
precisely the representations on which this grant was founded.
This paper, nor a copy of it, is not among the papers annexed to the
petition: nor is the report of the Surveyor Pintado. They ought both
to be there
I recommend, also, that a call be made for the specific power from
the crown of Spain to Ramizes, under which he professes to act in
making this grant. The recital of such a power in the grant will not
suffice. We must see the power itself or an authentic copy of it; and
the Agent who visits Havana ought to compare this copy with the
original, or to take a copy from the original while at Havana. I am

strongly under the impression that Ramizes had no such powers—
and that what he alludes to in the grant was simply a letter from the
King exhorting him, in general terms to encourage the settlement of
the Province by all the means in his power—which can be fairly
construed only as referring to an encouragement within the scope of
the standing regulations—I find that the commissioners of the land
claims in West Florida refer to an edict of the King of Spain in 1754
as the basis of all the colonial land regulations: this document I have
not seen, though it may possibly be in the back of those regulations
which is about to be published here by the authority of the govern-
ment”—I would recommend that whatever Spanish edicts or regula-
tions are relied on in the trial of the cause should be incorporated
in the record—or so specifically referred to by the Record as to leave
no doubt of their identity when the cause comes here

Sir By the last mail I received your favour of the 17" ult." In
which you request me to State to you in detail the particular services
that have been rendered in my district by M. Brents the Agent
appointed under the sanction of the act approved the 23" of May 1828.”
And also as far as practicable the extent of the services that may
probably be required of him within th[e] present year. In answer
to which I have to state that M. Brents visited this district in the
month of November last while our Superior Court was in Session &
spent about ten days examining the papers and documents relating
to that class of claims which it was expected would be brought before
the court under the act above mentioned, but one suit had then been
instituted under that act, I furnished him Copies of the petition and
answer in that case, which he examined & stated his views with
regard to the course which should be pursued in the defence, I am
not aware that any other services have been performed by M. Brents
in this district, or that up to that period there were any other for
him to perform. It is impossible to determine at present the extent
of the services that may probably be required of him within the
present year. only seven suits have as yet been instituted, although
there are about eighty claims which come within the provisions of
the act. from the indifference hitherto manifested in relation to a
large portion of these claims I am inclined to believe that they will
never be prosecuted, in every suit more or less oral testimony must
be taken, but it appears to me that a general superintendant whose
duties extend to the other three judicial districts as well as to this,
cannot attend to this duty and that the discharge of it must neces-
sarily] devolve principally upon the resident attorney, and] permit
me to assure you that so long as I am honoure[d] with the place which
I now hold it shall not be n[eg]lected.

much solicitude that I am induced to present them a second time for
the consideration of the Government.—Occupying an insulated spot,
more than two hundred miles from the nearest Military post, or, in-
deed, any other place from which the smallest aid could be procured,
surrounded by a sea infested with pirates and other depredators al-
most as lawless, you will believe, that a few unarmed inhabitants
have but little reason to felicitate themselves upon the security
afforded to their persons & property.
When I first came to this place, finding that the population was
composed of a heterogenous mass, congregated from various parts of
the world, many of whom were unacquainted with the operation of
our laws, and had for several years been living in a state of unre-
strained, and indeed licentious, freedom, I anticipated that the
officers, of the Court might meet some difficulty in carrying into effect
its judgments and decrees. To obviate this, I addressed a letter to
the Delegate from the Territory requesting him to apply to the War
Department for a company of troops to be stationed here, to aid
them in any emergency which might arise.” To this application
Major Gen. M'Comb responded, by directing Col. Brooke to proceed
to the island, examine its situation, and report upon the propriety
of making it a military post "–This duty has been performed by
Col Brooke" and I expect a company of troops will eventually be
stationed here; but untill that shall be done, unless some other regu-
lation be made the Islanders and much valuable property must re-
main in a cruelly exposed situation. When I made the application
to the war department, I had no view, other than the one disclosed,
but the transactions of every day since, have convinced me that an
efficient force is of more importance for other Objects—At this time,
the Gulf is infested with a horde of pirates, who shelter themselves
among the rocks and in the small inlets along the coast of Cuba,
Occasionly darting out upon Our Wessels, murdering & robbing, and
sometimes extending their depredations as far as the Coast of Flor-
ida.—A short time, since a piratical vessel, manned by upwards of
one hundred desperadoes, came to our coast, took a Sloop and com-
pell'd the master to pilot them to such places as they directed—So
daring an act convinces me that they are capable of any attempt,
and when it is known that large sums of money are frequently de-
posited here, an attack may be dreaded. But this is not the only

source of uneasiness; many not engaged in open piracy are almost as
dangerous and lawless in their conduct:—a few days ago a Brig bound
from Havana to Cadiz was wrecked upon the Florida reef—the Brig
was lost, but the crew, consisting of 40 persons, were taken off and
brought to this place and notwithstanding the services rendered them
in preserving the lives and the kindness and hospitality extended to
them in their distress they made an attempt to seize the vessels em-
ployed for their benefit and after their arrival in port, committed
such outrages as compell’d Captain Harrison, of the Revenue Cutter
Pulaski, to send out his crew to check them—these men are now at
large on the Island, and must remain so, ungarded, until an oppor-
tunity can be had of sending them to Cuba.
It is with pleasure I acknowledge that the Officers commanding
the Revenue Cutters upon this station have given every protection
to the inhabitants at this place, and to our Commerce along the
Coast which their limited means would allow. At my request Cap-
tain Harrison has been in port, and in the vicinity as much as his
other duties would permit; but at no time and under no exigency,
could he furnish more than fifteen effective men and this force is
believed to be much too small for any beneficial purpose.—If the
Crews of these vessels were increased to the extent allowed by law,
the most important advantages might be derived from their services
not only in securing the revenue but in guarding our commerce from
Piratical aggression and protecting the inhabitants of the Island
from lawless invasion.—at present they must be wholly inefficient in
any hostile operations as there are not more men on board of either
than are absolutely required to navigate them and so far from being
able to defend our Merchantmen from piratical Cruisers, they could
not under the most favourable circumstances, successfully compete
with several that are now afloat—
It is for the purpose of asking from you an increase of the force of
these vessels, that I have addressed you at this time; believing that
the circumstances, by which we are at present surrounded will induce
you to grant this request The full compliment, of seventy, men, al-
lowed by law would make them highly effective, but less than fifty
at such a time as this, would keep them partially inoperative

COL. JAMES GADSDEN Tallahassee Florida.
SIR, In your letter of the 5" of January last,” giving me some
account of your examination of the inland passage between the S'
John's and the S' Mary's, you say that by the next mail you intended
to forward a more detailed Report on the subject. The length of time
which has now elapsed, without the receipt of that report, makes me
fear that it has been lost;" and to avoid further inconvenience from
the delay of funds, a requisition, heretofore delayed, in expectation
of your report and estimate, is to day made for $1000 to be remitted
to you at Tallahassee, for the purposes of this work. As the sum of
$13500, of which you have been advised, is the whole amount appro-
priated for the object intrusted to you," it is necessary that the
expenditures, on any contract which you may make, including your
own compensation, should be confined to this sum; and if it should
appear that any further appropriation is necessary for the completion
of the work, it will be asked for, on your estimate at a future time—
At the late session of Congress an appropriation of $6.500 was made
“for improving the Harbour of St Marks by removing obstructions in
the same”; * this appropriation was based on an estimate of M. D. B.
Macomb, who is engaged on the improvement of the Apalachicola
river, and it is desirable to procure a suitable Agent for carrying on
the improvement of S' Marks, with as little delay as practicable—I
have therefore to request that you will name to me some person of
good character, and competent to direct the work; or if possible, that
you will yourself undertake the Agency; in that case, you are requested
to adopt measures to have the object of the law carried into immediate
execution.”
A copy of M" Macombs Report and map is herewith transmitted.”

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
PENSACOLA, April 12" 1829.
GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt by this
day's mail of your order of the 23" Ulto.,” in relation to the Road
between Pensacola & Blakely, & Mobile Point; and repairing that
from Pensacola to Tallahassee.—
I am now on the point of leaving here for New Orleans to be absent
a week at farthest; and immediately on my Return shall make arrange-
ments to commence the work—and in the manner suggested—by
hired axe-men:—Preparatory to the actual commencement of the
work however it will be necessary for me to make some additional
examination of the Routes—especially that from Pensacola to Talla-
hassee.—
I request that you will favor me in the meanwhile with your instruc-
tions as to whether the Road between Pensacola & Blakely, & Mobile
Point shall be opened & worked upon in the manner recommended
in my report of 10" March 1828.”—Also whether in opening the Road
from Pensacola to Mobile Point, it is intended that I shall follow the
route by “Poncho's Ferry” on the Perdido River as is recommended
in that Report. This Route is I think to be preferred at the present
time, as it is the only one leading to Mobile Point which will have
the advantage of a public Ferry kept by a Citizen either at this or at a
future time. On the other mentioned and more direct route, (which
is also preferable as to ground,) to Mobile Point, a ferry must be kept
up for military purposes only, and is not likely to be the case except
in a period of war.—
I am at a loss to understand whether the Road from Pensacola to
Tallahassee ordered to be repaired, be the one opened by myself &
called the Military Road, or that upon which the mail is transported;
hence in relation to it I am also constrained to ask your further
instructions.—That Road (the Military Road,) owing to the almost
utter impracticability of keeping up the Ferry across the Bay at this
place, is not nor can ever be of any great utility to the Public gen-
erally;—added to this no ferry is now, or has been, kept up for a long
time, at the Choctawhatchie River;—This Route, although much
the most direct & shortest, yet it leads near to the Sea Coast, cutting
numerous streams, through a sandy, sterile, Pine Barren Country,
in which there is no prospect of settlements being made; of course
the Road is neither used nor worked upon by the Citizens, nor will
it ever be kept up by their labor. I know that it would be more agree-

able too, to the Citizens of the Country that the money appropri-
ated should be expended on the Route by which the mail travels
from this place to Tallahassee; and which I would myself most
respectfully recommend to your favourable consideration; with this
difference only, that if a ferry should be established at the Head of
Pensacola Bay, as there is now an order of Court for, I would recom-
mend that the money & work should be expended at that crossing in
preference to going higher up by “Cotton's Ferry” on the Escambia
which is the present route.—The crossing at “Cotton's Ferry” through
the swamp is four miles,—and it will take one third of the whole sum
appropriated to make that swamp of good passage in high water,
owing to wide & numerous Bayous running through it.—If the Ferry
is established at the Head of the Bay as spoken of, both Roads join
in the high Pine woods opposite to “Cotton's Ferry”, and from
thence will be the same.—If it is decided to improve the Post Road
to Tallahassee with this appropriation,-and not the Military Road
to Tallahassee,—which I certainly think preferable; and it is left to
my discretion which of the two Ferrys to pass at, my first step will
be to ascertain the difference of labor really required at each, with the
wishes of the People themselves in relation to it—as also to all other
parts of the Route most proper to work on in expending the amount
appropriated.—I must also request to be instructed whether when
working on this Road too, I am to be guided in my manner of doing
it, by the mode recommended in the said Report of 10* March 1828,
touching the Roads to Blakely & Mobile Point.—I have in that
Report explained fully my views as to the manner most proper for
working on Roads in a Wilderness Country like this:—besides, the
small sums appropriated will admit of no other kind of Roads being
made.—I will only add further, that in a Country newly settled like
this, I have ascertained by experience that the money of the Govern-
ment is best employed by improving the Roads which the Citizens
lay out and use:—and in the present case I should only have to keep
in view the mail Road towards Tallahassee, without any extraor-
dinary deviations from that Route which is the most direct as used
by the Citizens & by Travellers.—

[April 13, 1829]
TO/ GEORGE GRAHAM Esq. Gen' Land Office
SIR/I am in the receipt of your two favours of the 21 Feby * & 17."
Ult” * These communications reached me irregularly owing to high
waters. This cause alone must be my apology, in not giving the latter
communication, a prompt and immediate answer. “The particular
services that have been rendered in your District by M. Brent's the
Agent appointed under the sanction of the act approved the 23rd
May 1828” * is the first enquiry made by the Department, and in
reply thereto I can only state, that Mr Brent's arrived at Tallahassee
in October last—that he advised with me upon all occasion's, touching
the interests of the government, and used great dilligence in making
the necessary preperations to take testimony in Forbe's case, the
only case pending in Middle Florida.—Mr Brent's visited St. Augus-
tine, and returned through this place on his way to Pensacola, and
whilst here, we agreed to open two commissions in the aforesaid
case—One at Pensacola, and one here.—Upon Mr Brent's] arrival
at Pensacola, he informed me of his examination of the public archives,
stating that he had discovered important testimony, which would
be taken there, under the commission this spring.—This gentleman
has not arrived in the Territory that I can learn, tho' he may be at
Pensacola at this time, attending the execution of the Commission.—
“It is also desirable, that you should state as far as practicable, the
extent of the services that may probably be required of him within
the present year[.”]
In reply to this enquiry, I find it difficult to give a prompt and
ready answer, inasmuch, as I am in the dark, how far the government

may or may not be disposed to sanction my views already intimated,
and now for the first time submitted to the President U. S.–If the
government or Petitioner's, open a Commission at Havanna this
Spring a Competent Agent must be employed to execute the Commis-
sion, and too great care cannot be used in the performance of so deli-
cate a procedure.—The two Commissions refered to, with other
testimony I have been enabled to discover since M. Brent's absence,
will occupy M. Brent's at least two months, with all the aid I can give
him.—If the government and Petitioners determine not to open a
foreign Commission, this case will be ready for argument in October
term next in all probability.—M. Brent's services will be highly
important in the necessary preperation of this case, and no doubt he
can employ himself, so as to answer useful purposes to the govern-
ment.—I need not remind the department of the importance of this
case, embracing some of the richist portion of the public domain in
Middle Florida—covering nearly two millions of acres, and taking in,
within it's portentous grasp, many of the most important commercial
depots of Florida.—The citizens of Middle Florida, are impatient for
it's settlement, indeed, the agricultural & commericial interests of
this people are very much cramp" and impeded by the doubts which
cloud this subject.—No efforts of mine have been spared to bring about
this desirable end, yet there is too much at stake, to allow me to act
precepitately or incautiously.”—
I would remind the government, that the Honb" Mr Berrien Atty
Gen' U S is employed by the eehamissiehers Petitioners in this Case,
and tis presumed, he will reserve to himself the privelege of fulfilling
his engagements to his clients.—This state of things, necessarily
precludes us from advising with the Atty Gen' in the progress of this
cause, and with whom by law I am authorised to consult and advise.—
I hope measures will be taken touching this latter point, so that I may

TREASURY DEPARTMENTApril 14, 1829.
SIR: Your favor of yesterday is received * and I also regret not
having an opportunity of a conference with you before you leave the
city. With regard to the Land Claim to which your note refers, I
have to observe that when I requested M. Graham to confer with
you on the subject, and especially as to the amount of a retaining
fee that would be satisfactory to you, I requested him to say, that the
President desired you to consider yourself as retained in all the dis-
puted claims in Florida and Missouri, arising under Spanish grants
which might depend upon similar principles. It was under this view
of the subject that I suggested to the President the propriety of giving
you a retaining fee of one thousand dollars, which he consented to,
with an understanding that an additional fee should be paid for argu-
ing each of the cases of Forbes and Arredondo in Florida, and that of
Soulard ” in Missouri, and such of the other cases as the President
may hereafter deem proper to employ assistant counsel to argue in
the Supreme Court. Should other cases of the same character be
ascertained in Alabama or elsewhere, there can be no objection to
including them in the engagement, which will be the more necessary
for the reason stated by you in relation to the propriety of giving
instructions to the District Attorneys in preparing the cases for trial
in the Courts below.
Instructions will be given to the District Attorneys to correspond
with you through the Treasury Department,” and every other facility
in the management of these very important causes that can be afforded
will be granted with the greatest readiness.
I am very respectfully, Sir, Your Obdnt Servant

COMMISSION OF JOHN G. STOWER AS UNITED STATES
ATTORNEY (SOUTHERN DISTRICT)
[NA: SD, Attys. Temp. Comms. Bk. 1]
[April 20, 1829]
ANDREW JACKSON, President of the United States of America,
To all who shall see these presents, greeting:
Know ye, That reposing special trust and confidence in the In-
tegrity, Ability, and Learning of JOHN G. STOWER of New York I do
appoint him Attorney of the United States for the Southern Judicial
District in the Territory of Florida;" and do authorize and empower
him to execute and fulfil the duties of that Office according to Law;
and to have and to hold the said Office, with all the powers, privileges
and emoluments thereunto legally appertaining, unto him, the said
JOHN G. STOWER during the pleasure of the President of the United
States for the time being, and until the end of the next session of the
Senate of the United States, and no longer. -
In Testimony Whereof, I have caused these Letters to
be made Patent, and the Seal of the United States to be
hereunto affixed. Given under my hand, at the City
of Washington, the twentieth day of April in the year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and twenty Nine and of the Independence
of the United States of America, the fifty third.”
ANDREW JACKSON,
By the President:
M. WAN BUREN, Secretary of State.
* Stower was appointed to replace William A. McRea who was informed of
the action, Apr. 28, 1829 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., XXIII). McRea was killed,
May 24, 1829, by one Charles E. Hawkins, a former officer in the Mexican navy,
with whom he had fought several duels (LC, Tallahassee Fla. Advocate, Mar.
14, July 11, and Aug. 1, 1829). Stower, a former Representative in Congress
from New York, was recommended by the Congressional delegations from that
state and from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, Feb. 20, and Mar. 4, 1829
(NA, SD, Applications). His nomination for a regular term, Jan. 5, 1830, was
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, Feb. 3, 1830 (Senate, Exec. Journal,
Iv, 42, 55). Del. White's objection to the appointment (post, p. 333) delayed the
committee's report until Mar. 3, 1830 (Senate, Exec. Journal, IV, 56,64, 85), and
before further action could be taken Stower resigned (post, p. 382). See post,
p. 415.
* The commission was transmitted to Stower, Apr. 30, 1829 (NA, SD, Dom.
Lets., XXIII), and he accepted, May 15, 1829 (loc. cit., Acceptances). He reported
from New York, Oct. 15, 1829 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets.), that he was on his way to
Key West. He announced his arrival, Nov. 10, 1829 (loc. cit.), but too late to
transact any business at the court.

to the District Attorneys in Florida in consequence of having been

relative to the Florida Cases.—But as the general objections, stated
by you are applicable to the cases in both Territories, I shall forward
extracts from your letter to the several District Attorneys in Florida,
and shall request of them to forward their answers for your super-

and in each of the several classes of cases that may involve similar
points.”—

master general however, established an office and a private route to
this place, by which the proceeds of postage alone were allowed to
defray the expense of transporting the Mail.—Under this arrangement
no contract for carrying the mail can be made, as no person is willing
to undertake it and depend upon a source so precarious for compen-
sation,-We are therefore virtually deprived of the benefits of a Mail
communication,-
We therefore earnestly request you to endeavour to have some
provision made by Law, for carrying the mail weekly from Quincy or

Esq
SIR, The Hon: Joseph M. White having been retained as assistant
Counsel under the provisions of the Act of May 1828,” in all the cases
that may arise under that act with the exception of those of F. M.
Arredondo & Son, and of Forbes & C° and as it is of much importance
that the cases should be properly prepared before they are presented
to the Courts, and that each and every point on which the U States
may rely for the purpose of defeating the claim, should be clearly and
distinctly stated in the answer to each bill filed against the U States:
you will therefore call on M* White for his aid and advice in drawing
your answer in each case (with the exceptions above stated) in which
you may deem such aid and advice necessary or desireable. M"
White is specially engaged to argue, not only in the Courts below, but
in the Supreme Court all cases pronounced by the Board of which he
was a member, fraudulent, if any such case can come before the Courts,
and in all cases in Florida depending on British claims, and under his
general retainer the Government considers him bound to argue any
case that it may be deemed necessary that he should argue in the
Courts below."
I enclose for your information & guidance an extract from a letter
from Mr Wirt to the Secretary of the Treasury," which altho' written
more particularly in reference to the cases in Arkansaw, yet the gen-
eral suggestions are also applicable to many of the points that will be
embraced in the cases arising under the Act of May 23* 1828.
* This letter was also sent to Thomas Douglas with the addition of the follow-
ing: “P. S. As it would appear from a published letter from Mr White that he
does not take the Same view of his engagement that is taken by the Gov" and as
yr answer as amended in the case of Arredondo & Son, (& which Mr White repre-
sented as depending on points altogether different from the other Cases) embraces
points that will be applicable, it is presumed, to many other cases in the Alachua
Country, it is particularly advisable that you communicate and advise with M*
Wirt on every doubtful and difficult point.”
* Approved May 23, 1828 (4 STAT. 284–286).
* This Extract sent Mr White Apl. 24. '29; and copy of letter as addressed to
Thomas Douglas Esq sent Gen R. K. Call [Marginal note on the MS.] Opposite
the same paragraph are the following marginal notes: “Copied for Hon S D
Ingham 11 June 1829” “Copied for Hon L. McLane Secy of the Treas, 24 Dec'
1831.” The extract was sent to White on Apr. 24 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent,

In consequence of the previous engagement of the Attorney Gen',
M” Wirt has been retained in the particular cases of Arredondo &
Son, and Forbes & C° and in such other cases as the engagements of
the Attorney General may render it inexpedient for him to argue in
the Supreme Court. I am, therefore, directed by the Secretary of
the Treasury to request that your answers to the bills filed not only
in each of the cases above mentioned, but in every other case of impor-
tance arising under the Act alluded to, should be transmitted thro'
this Office for the purpose of being submitted to M'. Wirt before such
answers are filed.
As the cases will probably resolve themselves into several classes of
cases which embrace the same points, and will require similar answers
it will of course not be necessary to forward your answers in more than
one case of each of such classes.—
It is also presumable that a few cases may be selected which will
involve each and every point on which it may be necessary to obtain
the decision of the Supreme Court. Such cases if possible should
first be prepared for trial and brought up on appeal, leaving the other
cases untried below to abide the decisions of the Supreme Court.—
I am also instructed to express the desire of the President that your
particular attention and vigilance be given to the management of
all the cases arising in your District under the provisions of the Act
of the 23" May, 1828. and that in drawing up your answers to the
Bills filed, you take especial care to embrace every point on which
the United States may possibly rely for defence."

to the earlier letter, Graham stated on Apr. 17, 1829 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Sent,

documents in that case. Ringgold explained, May 5, 1829 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets.

other principles than those stated in y” letter to me of the 14th of
August 1828,” and will embrace points for decision which are common
to many other cases in Florida, arising under the Act of May 1828.—

convenient place to open the investigation, accordingly apprised Co'
Humphreys of my determination
From the magnitude of the charges & the ardor with which they
had been pressed, not a doubt was entertained but that all needfull
assistance would be afforded to facilitate the investigation What
was my surprise to find the reverse—Those who had been most
clamourous appeared most disposed to evade the enquiry—And in
one instance there was a positive refusal, either to sustain his charges
by his own affidavit or the testimony of others. he appeared dis-
pleased that the Gov" had not taken earlier notice of his complaint,

Out of all the charges Direct & indirect that had been made only
the four contained in N° 10—were attempted to be sustained
To the first charge see (N° 10.) the three Depositions Marked (A)
were taken they do not sustain the charge—They shew no want of
respect for the orders of the Department or zeal in the discharge of
duty the Letter to M Lancaster (spoken of by Lowe) the Agent does
not deny but explains to be an act of friendship not incompatible
with duty, it was designed to give Chaires or his Atty. notice that
he the Agent was about to have delivered the negroes in obedience
to the order he had rec". So that he could have an opportunity of
asserting, by due course of Law an adverse claim to this property.

The second Charge is in my opinion no better sustained, the Depo-
sition of W. Smith Esq" was the only one taken see (B) 'tho he is
entitled to entire confidence as a man of strict verasity, he was evi-
dently mistaken as to the delivery of the Negroe Girls, I learned
from M. Kingsley, that the Girls had been delivered & sold in the
month of July last, of this I presume M. Smith was not informed.
this charge was predicated upon a Volunture, Exparty, affidavit of
W" Everet—Strong & explicit. But from all I can learn of this
mans Character, any Statement coming from him should be rec" with
caution. Mr John Buck to whome he refers (in a letter to me (Marked
B.B.) contradicts his whole statement. I called on him expecting a
confirmation, but he declined giving evidence as he says, out of
Delicascy to Everett. I have but little confidence in the statement
of either of them.
On the third charge the Deposition of M. Morgan was taken (See
C) He stated that the Work done by him in setting sugar Kettles
for Co.' Humphreys as well as the Chimney to the Agency House was
all charged to the United States—he likewise gives it as his opinion
that the labour & materials furnished by Co." Humphreys on the
Chimney, was worth fully as much as the price charged for setting
up the Kettles. Let this be admitted and yet the least that can be
said. It is certainly a loose, careless, & unjustifyable manner of

transacting business—It would have but little trouble for the Agent
to have kept a regular account of the Labour & Materials supplyed
by him, the Gov" could then have known for what they were paying
To the fourth charge S. Streeter was examined (see D) Much tes-
timony could have been procured to establish this charge in part,
Wiz, that the Indians were in the practice of leaving there own bound-
ary & roaming throughout the Territory greatly to the anoyance &
injury of the Citizens It is within my own observation & was ad-
mitted by the Agent. But he denies having the power to controle
them in that respect—Not knowing how far his authority extends,
or what power he has, I can only state that the evil exists to a verry
great extent—Some exertions were made but without effect to re-
strain them. whilst I was in the Nation. The Agent sent out a small
atthaber detachment to arrest & bring in a party of Indians charged
with committing some depredations. But they escaped pursuit &
could not be found
To account for the reason why so few depositions were taken &
the length of time employed about it, It is necessary to state that
in all most every case there was an absolute refusal to give testimony
unless in obedience to a compulsory process On application to the
District Atty. to know if such could be had he gave an opinion that
it could not—The Witnesses were scattered over several hundred
miles of Country, & both the weather & the Roads extremly bad.

he was here some months since for taking Depositions on behalf of
the United States in relation to a claim in the Middle District and of
some written memoranda which he prepared for my guidance in the
matter I understood also from himself and do not doubt that he
made a somewhat laborious examination of the original documents
in the office of the keeper of the public archives in this place
The weight of the duties of M" Brents lies in Middle Florida. There
were presented to the Commissioners two claims for large tracts of
land by John Forbes & C° One of these claims, and the most valuable
of them lies in Middle Florida. It is supposed that the decision of the
Superior Court upon this claim will test the validity of the other
which is situate in this District. I presume therefore that the latter
claim will be presented to the Court of this District more for the sake
of preserving to the claimants the right secured to them of bringing
the suit than with a view of litigating the subject here In relation
to the other claims in West Florida I doubt much if the services of
M. Brents will be necessary at all. The claims here are of small
value—will not exceed two in number—and the only one on which
suit has yet been brought is of undoubted validity
I will avail myself of the present opportunity to say that if a seven
years acquaintance with the titles to land in this country—the fact
of my being the representative of the Government in this District—
and that of my having superintended the taking of all the testimony
which has been taken in relation to the claim of Forbes & C° should
be thought by the President to qualify me in any degree to be useful to
the United States in the Court of the Middle District I will will-
ingly attend the trial of the large claim above mentioned, on being
instructed to do so. I believe the claim to be decidedly bad; and it
cannot be doubted that the Territory will ultimately suffer even more
than the United States from its confirmation *

no other arguments to offer than those now before you embraced in
my letter of the 12" Inst." and all my correspondence respecting this
Road from its commencement up to this time.—I ever believed that
no ferry could be kept up over this Bay opposite to Pensacola, and I
believe so still.—It is however, I ought to remark, the Judges' wish
to leave the Military Road Seventy five miles East of Deer Point,”

assertain the true state of the complaint & for that purpose made use
of all proper means to procure testimony by calling on all & every
individual who had lodged complaints & those refered to by them at the

& the examination of such as he thought proper to call on. Many &
obstinate dificulties presented themselves, (as they were alluded to in
my last. not necessary here to repeat).—from the extrem bad state
of the Roads & weather. & from great exposure bad health ensued

Gad Humphreys to Alexander Adair
SEMINOLE AGENCY 27* April 1829.
ALEX ADAIR Esq." Special Agt. War dpt.
SIR, Upon a review of the testimony adduced in support of the com-
plaints against me, which under the authority of the dept of War,
you have been engaged in investigating, I do not conceive it requisite
to enter into a formal defence—it seems to me, that it would be poorly
complimentary to the good sense of the President, and any thing but
respectful to him, to suppose, that a studied argument is necessary,
to convince him, of the entire groundlessness of the accusations, nay
more, that the Statements, which form their basis, are the offspring
of malevolence and cupidity; for I may safely assert, and without the
fear of well grounded contradiction, that there is not, in the whole
mass of testimony taken in the case, one particle of such proof, as
would be admissable in a court of law, which goes to sustain even a
single charge, enumerated in the catalogue of my alledged enormities;
nor has there indeed, been any proof, legal or illegal furnished on the
part of the prosecution (if we except the affidavit of the draggooned
affiant, William Everitt) which is not wholly destroyed by over-
whelming opposing testimony, and even Everitt's assertions are in
substance positively and unqualifiedly contradicted, by the statement
of his associate in business, Mr Buck; which statement, though not
made under oath, is equally valid in law, with the procured exparte
affidavit it contravenes, and decidedly more to be respected, as
evidencing regard for truth; a principle, which is not to be found
among the characteristics of the affidavit.—Gross as is the Statement
of Mr Everitt, I must confess that it does not surprise me! When I
consider his character, and reflect in whose hands he was, when his
statement was made; I only wonder that his pliancy of conscience was
not further used against me. Here for the present I leave him and
his employers to such enjoyments as their own sober reflections upon
their conduct in this matter, may bring with them.—There is another
witness in the case, (Waters Smith Esq") whose elevated standing,
claims from me for his statements, the tribute of a passing notice—
The high respect heretofore entertained by me, for this gentleman
renders the task which justice to myself imposes of pointedly adverting
to his testimony, peculiarly unpleasant, nevertheless, duty seems to
forbid, my passing unheeded, the glaring discrepance which a com-
parison of his statements, with those of three other gentlemen of
equal respectability so clearly exhibits.—Mr Smith states on the 19*
of Feby. 1829, that a negro woman named Sally; whom he was em-
powered by Mr Kingsly to receive from me, as Agent for the Seminole

Indians; though often applied for, had not been delivered.—His
language upon the subject at the date before named is, “This woman
has not been delivered”
By the certificate of Maj Glassell, and the depositions of Lt New-
comb and Assistant Surgeon Hawkins," it will be seen, that this woman
had as early as November or Dec 1828, (at best 3 or 4 months pre-
vious to the date of Mr Smiths statement) been delivered by me to a
person fully and specially authorized by him, not only to receive, but
sell her; and of the fact of said delivery and also of a sale, he had been
seasonably and distinctly advised—How under such circumstances, it
was possible for him to deny the delivery, I am utterly at a loss to
imagine, unless it may be attributed to a treachery of his memory, and
this I would fain believe to be the fact, and indeed I would adopt
almost any belief upon the subject, sooner than draw the conclusion,
that he had, under the solemnity of an Oath, wittingly mistated—Over
this transaction (much as it was calculated to injure me, and strange
as it may appear) I freely say, let the veil of Charity be thrown, and
let the remembrance of it pass away, never to be recalled; If he has
acted honestly, his own conscience will bear him out, if wickedly,
there is a tribunal before which he must inevitably answer for it—With
the witnesses I have now done! It was not my intention in the first
instance to have said as much, I will only add that there are reasons
abundently substantial, which would have fully justified me in alto-
gether declining to answer the charges, had I felt so disposed,—
waiving hewever these ebjeetiehs (weighty as they are) ever influeheed
by the wish- The exparte and of course illegal mode directed in the
case by the dep", as exhibited in your letter of instructions, (leaving
me no room to doubt from the character thus stamped upon the
investigation, in its outset; that it was designed, not to promote the
ends and further the sacred cause of justice, but as an engine to be
wielded for the unhallowed purpose, of gratifying personal dislike
and advancing selfish views)—and again, the total want of Specificness
in the charges, as to facts dates &c &c—These or either of them, if
urged, must in a legal point of view, have formed an insuperable
objection to the proceedings—Waiving however these considerations,
(weighty as they are) and influenced by the wish to encourage a free
and full enquiry into my conduct, which had been subjected to the
repeated aspersions of interested and malignant libellers; I determined
to remove all obstacles depending upon myself and give such a latitude
in the examination as should leave my enemies no room for quibble,
or ground for after insinuations of an unkind nature, and at the same
time place the prosecution in its true light.—befere the geverañaeht

SIR. The communication of the Chief Engineer of the 21" March
1829.” has been received and would have been attended immediately
but for my absence on the Appalachicola River.
I herewith transmit to the Department Duplicate abstracts of
disbursements on acct of the survey of the River and Harbor of St

for the above survey, whereby it appears that a Balance is due me of
$87.87 a receipt for which is also transmitted and which amount I
request may be paid to General Alexander Macomb for purposes of
which I have advised him.
I have twice visited the River Appalachicola with the view of
renewing operations in that quarter but the water I found entirely too
high, and the weather too cold to work advantageously. I only wait
for a subsidence of the present freshet, to attack again the River of
Sticks. The amount of labor expended upon that part of the River
during the month of November, has thus far proved advantageous to
the navigation of the River by Boats of all kinds, and has completely
tested the principle in the removal of the island, a part of which only
was dug away last fall. I find that there has been no farther accumu-
lation of drift wood and that the island has only to be removed on the
one side and a quantity of old drift wood on the other side, to give a
sufficient vent for the whole of water of the river I have every thing
in readiness to give an immediate attention to the Removal of the
obstructions of the whole River as soon as the water subsides.”

would represent a grievance of which they have heretofore
complained.
At the November Term of this Court, the then Grand Jury repre-
sented to the Court, the situation of the Jail of the Town of Key
West, and strongly urged the propriety of an appropriation on the
part of the General Government, to build one adequate to our wants.
Living in an isolated spot, apart from the main land and without
the ability to procure assistance in the want of its necessity; the Jury
are strongly impressed, not only with the pecularly dangerous situation
of the Inhabitants of this Island; but from the present condition of
the Jail, with the unfortunate situation of those who are confined:
Self preservation and the common feelings of humanity compel the
Jury to ask some assistance from the Government, to effect so desir-
able an object, and as a furtherance of their views: they present the
following reasons.
It is a matter too generally known, to require discussion, that the
great majority of the population of this Island, is composed of Mari-
ners, employed in the wrecking business, and it was to determine
their rights and of those interested in such cases and protect the
Revenue that a Court was organized at this Island—The habits the
mode of life of Mariners when upon shore, are also well known—and
though this Jury believe this population to be as good and orderly as
in any other portion of the Union yet, here as in all other places, the
strong arm of the Law is too often required to preserve order among
them and punish the guilty.

Coming from all parts of the world and of every class and denomi-
nation, it is but rational to suppose that the law should be often
exercised to punish offenders under the law, by imprisonment is here
impracticable—The Territory has no Jail The Town Council of Key
West, have by subscription erected a small Jail about twelve feet
square, in which all prisoners are confined; and at this period, three or
four imprisoned, for offences against the laws of the United States.
We further present, that humanity dictates the erection of a Jail,
in consequence of the confined state of the prison: one died there dur-
ing the last fall, and two are seriously ill for the want of air and exer-
cise and during this summer, we know not what may happen but
anticipate evil.
We are under the peculiar protection of the General Government
of the United States, and we appeal to its liberality, to its justice to
erect a building; so necessary for our safety and the lives of prisoners.
We present as a grievance the want of a Jail and respectfully urge
upon the Government the propriety of erecting one on this Island

THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL TO DANIEL E. BURCH
[NA:WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 13]
May 13th 1829.—
CAPT: D. E. BURCH, Asst: Quarter Master Pensacola—Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 12" Ultimo.”—You will
exercise your own judgment, in regard to the course of the proposed
road from Pensacola to Mobile Point. The route by way of “Panchos
Ferry,” though somewhat longer, seems to combine more advantages
than the other, taking into view the relation it holds to Blakely, that
it coincides in part, with the road from thence to the Point, and that
there is an established ferry on it. The amount appropriated, and
of which you have been advised, will determine the description of
*0 House Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., p. 362. Congress not having made an
appropriation, the Legislative Council by act approved Feb. 10, 1831, author-
ized the retention of $2,000 from the territorial tax on auction sales in Key West,
to construct a jail and cistern, and designated L. M. Stone, the U. S. marshal,
and W. A. Whitehead, the collector of customs, as commissioners to superintend
the construction of the jail (Fla., Acts, 1831, p. 28).

road which is to be made. That referred to in your letter of the 10th
of March 1828,” seems very well suited to the nature of the country
through which these roads pass, and the objects in view in opening
them.—
With respect to your proposition to apply the means at disposal,
to the repair of the road on which the mail is now carried between
Pensacola and Tallahassee instead of the military road, I have to
remark, that the appropriation is specifically for the repair of the
latter, and there would be an objection to departing materially from
its course. If the present post road intersects the Military road at
an inconsiderable distance from Pensacola, and is located on better
ground, it might, perhaps, be admissable to do as you propose; but,
if as I am inclined to believe, these roads do not intersect each other
at all, your suggestion could by no means be adopted, since it would
be a misapplication of the appropriation.—I will thank you for further
information as to the course of these roads.—
I send you enclosed herewith, copy of a letter from Judge Bracken-
ridge,” making some suggestions as to the best mode of operating
on the road to Tallahassee—He has been informed, that you are
charged with the superintendence of the work.—

SIR I have recently been advised of the institution of a Suit by
John Innerarity a member of the House of Forbes & C" against the
United States for the recovery of a tract of land embraced between
the River Appalachicola and Choctawhachy Rivers, in West Florida.
The grant does not specify the number of acres, but from its boun-

is one of the cases in which I have been employed by the Government
as assistant Counsel. I expect to receive a copy of the bill in this
case in a few days, when an answer shall be prepared. In the case
of Forbes & C° you have instructed a copy of the bill and answer to
be forwarded to M'. Wirt for his inspection, and I wish to be informed
whether it is the wish of the Department that the same course should
be pursued in this instance. An other Suit has been instituted for
the recovery of a large and valuable Island in the Appalachicola
River, said to have been granted to John Forbes individually in the
year 1811. This is the 3"Suit which has been brought by the members
of that House against the United States. I wish to be informed
whether it is the wish intention of the government to employ me in
the last mentioned case, and if so whether a copy of the bill and answer
shall be forwarded to Mr Wirt Or to Mr Berrien.

TALLAHASSEE June 2* 1829
SIR On this day your letter dated 7" May was rec" with the Span-
ish document & as the mail is shortly to depart have but little time to
answer it. Owing to the lack of a translation we are as yet unable to
judge of the effect of the document. We are however disposed to
suspect that it is a Wicked Contrivance of our adversaries together
with the Spanish officers to assist the Claim of Forbes & Co. This
house had great influence with the Spanish officers & the Claims in
the name of this house are now in the hands of a Wealthy & powerful
Combination of men, some of whom live at Havannah. Forbes
Claims in part are derived from Indian sales & sanctioned by some
of the inferior Spanish officers who it is believed had no power to
sell or Sanction sales. The Claimants wish if possible by presump-
tion or otherwise if pessible to shew that the higher officers of the
Spanish government (even the King) have sanctioned the purchase
of the indians & the acts of the inferior officers; or that being in-
formed of these Acts have not disavowed them. This it is believed has
been attempted by Causing their statements & evidences of title, to
be entered among the Archives at Havannah & from thence among
the Archives at Madrid; and furthermore it is believed that the
influence of this house through their agents has induced the trans-
mission of the documents (forwarded) to be sent to our government
here to be filed among our Archives and in this way to deduce the
Conclusion & beliefs that the whole transaction has been fair–
The Claimants have already got papers from Havannah as also
from Madrid filed among the papers of this suit. It is believed that
the accounts of the sales of these lands was never filed among the
archives of Madrid untill the year 1824. Altho we communicate
freely with the departments of our government, yet it is thought
unnecessary to make the foregoing statement or rather opinion of
ours public. We are apprehensive that we shall be under the necessity

PENSACOLA, F. June 2" 1829.
GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 13" Ultimo;"—And to report that I have commenced working
upon the Road from this place to Blakely, having engaged a sufficient
gang of Negroes with an Active Person to superintend their labour.
This mode is much better than a contract, as it will allow of having
a better Road at a less Cost in money, and is moreover preferable to
myself in its superintendence.—
I have no doubt but that the appropriation will enable me to com-
plete the Road to Blakely on the plan proposed; and also open in dis-
tance more than half of that to Mobile Point; and in that case, as
this last Road will be for Military purposes solely, I request you will
be pleased to inform me whether I may not be allowed to expend a
sufficient sum from out of the appropriation for the Q Mrs: Depart-
ment to enable me to complete it to the Point.—It would also be prop-
er, I think, while working in that part of the Country, after having
completed the Road to the Point, to open the communication by a
Road from thence to Blakely, by continuing the Road northwardly
to Blakely from the Point where the two coincide;—for which refer
to my sketch of 10* March 1828."—This Road too, is required
almost exclusively for Military purposes. The additional sum which
will be required to complete the first named, I estimate at $2000;
and for the last named $.1000.—In relation to the Roads from Pensacola
to Tallahassee, I have to state that the Road on which the mail is
carried does not coincide with the Military Road at all; nor does it

intersect it until within a few miles of Tallahassee. I shall therefore
make my arrangements to commence the Repair of the Military Road
so soon as the Heat of the Summer is over. The first forty miles
of the Route is almost entirely destitute of any but unwholesome
Pond-water, & in a dry season, a scarcity even of that.—The appro-
priation of $.3000, will be but barely adequate to place in such repair
as I should wish it to be left by me, the first seventy five miles; and
which is the portion of it that seems to be particularly interesting to
Judge Breckenridge."—
I do not approve at all of his proposition to employ the Inhabitants
to work as Labourers on the Road; it would not only be a more ex-
pensive, but an insufficient system.—Indeed there is not a single
family living in the entire district for Eighty miles East of Deer Point,
bounded North by the Waters which empty into and form Yellow
Water Bay, and the Sea-Shore on the South. It is well known, I
thought, to every one that the only labouring class of people, are
negroes, so far South as this; and it is with them only that I should be
willing to undertake to do work; even if the white men could be hired,
to whom the very name of overseer would be an insuperable obstacle:—
and it would be equally difficult to get an overseer who would be
willing to superintend the work of white men.—

ANDREW JACKSON President of the United States of America,
To all who shall see these presents, Greeting:
Know ye, That reposing special trust and confidence in the Integ-

him Marshal of the United States for the Southern Judicial District
of the Territory of Florida and do authorize and empower him to
execute and fulfil the duties of that Office according to Law; and to
have and to hold the said Office, with all the powers, privileges and
emoluments thereunto legally appertaining, unto him, the said JOHN
DEAN during the pleasure of the President of the United States for
the time being, and until the end of the next session of the Senate of
the United States, and no longer.”
In Testimony Whereof, I have caused these Letters to be made
Patent, and the Seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.
Given under my hand, at the City of Washington, the Sixth day of
June in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty
nine and of the Independence of the United States of America, the
Fifty third ”
[Andrew Jackson]
By the President:
[Martin Van Buren] Secretary of State.
* This commission was delivered at Washington; see post, p. 236. Dean suc-
ceeded Wilson who was informed of his displacement, July 8, 1829 (NA, SD,
Dom. Lets., XXIII). From Pensacola Wilson wrote to the Secretary of State,
Dec. 7, 1829 (loc. cit., Applications), enclosing testimonials (not present) and
claiming injustice had been done in removing him. On the same day (loc. cit.)
he informed the President that he had gone to Key West to collect documents
to prove that the charges against him were false and malicious. He applied for
the consulate at Havre, France. After unsuccessful attempts to see the Secre-
tary of State in Washington the following March, Wilson appealed to him, Mar.
29, 1830 (loc. cit.), for public employment and on June 29, 1830 (loc. cit.), applied
for the consulate at Vera Cruz.
* In response to a request from Dean, written at Key West, Sept. 17, 1829
(NA, SD, Misc. Lets. Rel. to Accts.), he was informed on Nov. 5, 1829 (loc. cit.,
Dom. Lets., XXIII), that a box containing a set of the laws of the United States
was being shipped to him.

GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
(NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:LS]
TALLAHASSEE INDIAN OFFICE June 9* 1829.
Hon" JoHN H EATON Secretary at War.
SIR, The duties which are usually assigned to the governors of
Territories in their capacity as Superintendents for which compensa-
tion is allowed by the government heretofore, has been taken from
me, and allotted to others, while the unprofitable and labourious duties
fell on me.” What benefit has resulted to the government by this
change, must be submitted to your judgment. What has been ef-
fected in relation to the claims for slaves in the Seminolee nation, and
how far they have been decided on, is unknown to me.
Whether the interests of our citizens will be promoted, by keeping
the Superintendent in ignorance on this subject, you can determine.
To me the citizens look for the protection and delivery of their prop-
erty. The Indians confide in and follow my advice, when not mislead
by those whose duty it is to advise them honestly.
I herewith transmit you a copy of my letter to Owen Marsh of 29*
May 1829, and a copy of his answer of the same date. That the
agent has traded largely with the Indians, I have no doubt; and that
he claims, and has on his plantation at the agency, slaves belonging
to the Indians, which he has no right to hold, I am convinced. What-
ever step the government may take in relation to the agent, still the
slaves and cattle which he has procured from the Indians, ought to
be retained by the order of the Department, until the examination
can be made as to the manner he has acquired this property.
If ever the government overlooks the violation of the Act of Con-
gress, which prohibits every person employed in the Indian Depart-
ment from trading with the Indians,” that moment consigns these
unfortunate people to certain destruction. Were I permitted to give
an opinion as to the mode of deciding the claims to property in the
Indian boundary, it would be to give notice to all parties concerned,
to attend at the Agency, —assemble the Chiefs of the nation,-and
have a fair investigation of the claims on both sides.
When I acted as I did once in this business, this course was adopted,
28 DuVal wrote to the Secretary of War, June 8, 1829 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd.,
Fla.), comparing his salary as Superintendent of Indian Affairs with the allow-
ances made to Gov. Cass of Michigan Territory and Gov. Clark of Missouri
Territory. He granted that there were more Indians in each of those territories
than in his superintendency but he emphasized that his labors were increased by
the few agents that were allotted. Justice required that such a situation be
remedied. See post, p. 230.

and in a very short time, many slaves were given up with the unani-
mous consent of the Chiefs, and all parties were perfectly satisfied
What is said in this letter in relation to the several subjects herein
mentioned, is submitted to the Department with the assurance, that
I neither wish or expect my opinions to have more weight, than
my official station may entitle them to, under the practice of the
government, and from my knowledge of your judgment and prin-
ciples, I confidently look for justice to all the parties concerned "

cattle which belong to the Indians, some of which he has not paid
for, but yet retains—as you acted as sub agent for several years, it
may be in your power to answer these questions, and I trust you
will do so. The agent has not executed the orders issued by the War
Department through me, to deliver slaves at several times to certain
citizens of Georgia and Florida who claimed them, but I beleive he
has thrown difficulties in the way of the owners of the property in
order to purchase up their claims at a reduced price. If you know
anything in relation to these facts, please to state it. If you as sub
agent executed my order for the delivery of slaves to their owners,
was your conduct approved by the agent.
The interests of the country call for an explanation of the conduct
of the agent. I have been severely censured by many of my fellow
citizens who owned slaves among the Indians, because they enter-
tained the opinion that I have not discharged my duty and compelled
the agent to perform his. So far as my authority and power could
extend, every thing I could do, was done by me If the agent has
disobeyed his orders, or in any particular acted improperly, either
towards his Government, our citizens or the Indians over whom he
presides, his conduct should be laid before the War Department.
I trust you will give such information as you possess in relation
to subjects herein mentioned, or any other that may be know to you,
that you consider deserving of attention,
I am Respectfully Your Obedient Servt
Wm P. DUVAL
[Endorsed] Letter to Owen Marsh—(Copy)
Oren Marsh to Governor DuVal
(Copy) TALLAHASSEE May 29* 1829.
TO HIS EXCELLY Wm P. DUVAL
SIR Yours of this date is received, in which you inform me that
charges have been made by the Chiefs of the Seminolee nation of
Indians, against Col. Humphreys, Indian agent in relation to the
payment of the annuity of 1826 to the chiefs of that nation—also
demanding information on several subjects, which are supposed to be
subjects of charge against the said Humphreys.
In answer to the first enquiry, I must say that as the payment of
the amount due the Indians for that year was made at Baltimore or
Washington City—and as I was in the nation myself, it is impossible
that I can be personally acquainted with the circumstances: but the
following is the story related to me by all the chiefs and interpreters
who accompanied him. Col. H. drew the money in the City of Wash-
ington, and left for Baltimore, where he paid the chiefs between Two


## p. 233 (#247) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 233
and Three Thousand Dollars, and took their receipt for the whole due
the nation. $450 was paid to two of the chiefs, each, and $200 or $250
a piece to all the others including the colour'd or mixed blooded one,
belonging to the Creek nation, 5 in number. This statement was made
by the chiefs through the Interpreter to M Hardage, a white man who
accompanied them, and who was present at the time the money was
paid as he stated to me, and I cannot for a moment doubt his word,
for independent of his having the reputation of being one amongst the
most honest men in the world, I am personally acquainted with him,
and know him to be so.
Col. H. denies to me and other persons that he took any money from
them for spoilations upon the crop at the agency, during the year 1827,
although he imposes upon the credulous red men with that allegation;
for they have never taken the trouble yet to think on the subject, or
they would recollect that their money was taken during the year 1826
and the crop destroyed in 1827. It is but a short time since he has
confessed even so much as to admit that he did withold a portion of
their due under any pretence.
With regard to the stock cattle which were delivered to the Indians
of that nation, I can say very little. I was not at the Agency at the
time the stock cattle were delivered, and do not know the number
they received: but this fact is certain, he has a large number of cows
now on hand, or in his possession, of that stock, and which are in the
marks and brands of those delivered by Major Chaires, I have heard
him say he purchased them from the Indians, and I have no doubt
that he might have purchased some 8 or 10 from them; but cannot
beleive he ever bought as many as 70 or 80 head of cows and calves.
Indeed I saw 30 or 40 head of cattle in his yard a few weeks, which
never were delivered to the Indians, some of which are now in his
possession. This fact can be fully established by calling on M" John
Stafford of Alachua, who was employed at the Agency at the time to
hunt and mind the stock delivered for the Indians.
He has purchased slaves of the Indians, I beleive at any rate, he had
one, a girl called Kate, which he obtained from an Indian woman
called Nelly. This one he has sold to a gentleman in the neighbour-
hood. With this exception, I beleive it would be difficult to prove
that he has purchased any from the Indians in his own name, nor do I
beleive he purchased the one above mentioned, for I have been told
by the Indians, that she was given to him upon a pledge, that the
slaves which were in dispute between Mrs Cook of St: Augustine and
the Indian woman, should not be delivered to the white claimant. I
am certain that on one occasion, and I beleive in almost every one,
he has thrown every obstacle in his power, in the way, to prevent the
delivery to the white claimants of the slaves in the nation.

The particular case is the one in which M* Everett of Georgia was
concerned. If it should be necessary, these facts will be developed.
I was ordered by the agent under that of the Secretary of War, to have
delivered to Mrs. Cook of St: Augustine, a large lott of negroes that
were in the nation, and executed the order in less than two weeks from
the time I received it. The agent appeared to be displeased, and said
to several persons and to me, that I had acted improperly and he
beleived that if I was worth it, the Indian woman could recover dam-
ages of me if a suit was commenced.
He has negroes in his possession, which he beleives and perhaps
knows to be the property of an Indian or Indians. They were pur-
chased from a M. Day of N. York, through his agent at St: Augustine,
Application was made to him, (the agent) by the Indian claimants to
recover the property for them, some one or two years before he made
the purchase; and it is beleived that he purchased them much cheaper,
by saying to persons who wished to purchase, that if they did buy
them, he would have them out of their hands in less than three months.
Col H. has been in the habit of purchasing cattle from the Indians,
and of course bought them cheap; and in many instances, he has
given them due bills signed “G.” which the Indians have shewn to
the officers, some of them at Tampa Bay, and complained that he
refused to pay them.

American minister in Great Britain, June 11, 1829, and to Alexander H. Everett,
American minister in Spain, June 16, with instructions to obtain the material
requested by the Secretary of the Treasury (NA, SD, Instructions to Ministers,

examination of the correspondence files of both the State Department and of the
American Embassy in London produced no letters to show that the American
Minister there obtained and sent to Washington copies of the Indian treaties.
The explanation may be that Del. White had already written to the legation to
request these same documents, for he wrote to Thomas Douglas, Nov. 8, 1829
(NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.), stating that he would send him copies of the
treaties which he had obtained in an authentic manner. Texts of several Indian

As the Island claimed by Forbes is probably on the West side of the
main channel of the River, I presume the suit for it has been brought

decision in this case as in the case of the lands claimed by Forbes &
Co. which lie on the East side of the Appalachicola and in the Middle

SAMUEL BRENTS TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
[NA:GAO, Misc. Treas. Accts., No. 56,033:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE June 29" 1829
SIR On the evening of the 22" instant the letter ef the of the
Secretary of State was rec" informing me that the president had con-
fered the appointment of Law agent in Florida upon Richard C
Allen.” I was then busily engaged in Closing some answers & other
preparations in the several Cases in West & Middle Florida.—As I
was sensible no other person at that time understood those Cases as
well as myself, & that the public Service might not suffer, I determined
to continue at the place & Compleat the business I was then engaged
in. I done so, & surrendered the whole of the papers in good order
to M Ringgold and General Call (the law agent not being at the time
in town) with my earnest advise & opinion as to the future manage-
ment of the Cases.—Since that time I have seen the law agent &
imparted to him my advise, such as I thought (if pursued) might
ensure Success. I am now about to leave the territory & expect to
reach home in about 25 days and while I quit the office under Circum-
stances which might be supposed by others to subject me to some
mortification, yet I feel none on my own account: On the contrary I
have felt peculiarly gratified at the expression of public opinion favor-
able to my management of the business of the United States in the
territory, & a strong desire that I should return to the fall term of the
Court at this place & Jackson Court in West Florida to assist in the
defence of those weighty Cases arising out of Forbes' grants in which
there is so much interest felt by the good people of the territory.—
As an evidence of the estimation in which my services in the territory
have been held I inclose you the letters of General Call & M Ringgold,”
which you will be kind enough to preserve & with this lay before the
President.—They wrote & handed them to me without Solicitation,
& expressed their regret that it was made necessary for me to quit the
Service.—My own determination at this time is to return in the fall
if able to get back; & in the mean time if it be not improper permit
me to request you to forward to me the Compelation of Spanish laws
Collected by Colo White. I am in hopes my future labors may com-
pensate the government for this small expenditure. I am not Certain
that it will be of any Service–It may be that I have already the same
matter in other books.—I have the Strongest anxiety for the Success
of the government as to the Claims in Middle Florida one or two
in West Florida & a few in the County of Alachua in East Florida.—
A large number of the Claims in East Florida are not worth much—
* NA (SD, Dom. Lets., XXIII).
* Both present, dated June 23, 1829.

Scarcely worth a defence—het Nothing but banks of Arid Land or
impenetrable marshes, perfectly uninhabitable.—As the connection
between myself as an agent & the government is dissolved, it would
afford me infinite Satisfaction if my Circumstances in life would
enable me to omit the Subject of Compensation alltogether—Such
however is not the Case.—My accounts are to be audited at the dis-
cretion of the President before whom you will please to lay them &
request an early adjustment.”—My account is here inclosed exclusive
of the Annual Compensation which it is hoped the President will raise
above the sum of $1500. There was no express agreement between
the government & myself but it was Certainly held out as an induce-
ment to me at & before my acceptance, that the Compensation would
be at least $2000 per annum. Even of that sum a large portion must
necessarily be exhausted in the expences. I Can say with Certainty
that all of what I have drawn has been laid out in the necessary
expences of the business, altho I have been exceedingly economical.
It is hoped that the President in Closing the accounts will not be
influenced by any belief that the business has been in the slightest
degree neglected.—Such (permit me to say) has not been the fact
altho some well meaning persons about Tallahassee may have thought
so.—From the time I rec" the appointment my attention has been
incessant altho not always in Tallahassee or even in Florida. Last
year before I left home my time had been assiduously employed in
preparations derived from the Spanish laws & ordinances & from the
reports of the Commissioners & papers pertaining to the particular
Cases which had been placed in my hands—These had been atten-
tively Studied.—When I went into Florida I took up residence at
Tallahassee, There were very extensive preparations making to
Commence suits but not a single suit Commenced.—I left there and
went on to attend the Court at St Augustine & there (in the month of
November) found only one suit, the very weighty suit brought on the
Claim of Arredondo & Son for a large body of the best land in East
Florida.
To this Claim my particular attention was directed–It was placed
in the best situation for trial. Copies of all necessary papers were
obtained to enable me to Study the Case at home & which has been
accordingly done. On my return to Tallahassee last fall I found the
weighty Case brought on the grants to Panton Leslie & Co & John
Forbes & Co for upwards of a Million of acres of the best land in
Middle Florida–In this Case there were perhaps 20 quires of Spanish

documents filed.—they were refered to a translator & when translated
were to be Copied before any answer Could be made.—To perform the
business of translating & making out Copies (a thing indispensible)
required, & actually took upwards of three months. I went from
thence to Pensacola taking with me Commissions to take depositions
in the last mentioned Case which has been done. The offices of the
Archives at S" Augustine & Pensacola were examined & papers
obtained preparatory to the Cases brought & expected to be brought.—
When at the last mentioned place (Pensacola) in December finding
nothing further to do, which Could not be done any where else as well
as in Florida, & finding it important to obtain (by examination of the
old papers of the Spanish government at Orleans) the Commissions of
the Intendants Morales & others as evidence in an extensive Class of
Cases in in Middle & West Florida I formed the design of returning
home by the way of the Mississippi, & done so, intending to return to
Florida early in the Spring. My time during the whole winter was
devoted to the business in Florida.
In the month of March I set out by the way of the Mississippi expect-
ing to be in Florida early in April. On my arrival at Orleans I was
detained there between three & four weeks before I Could obtain a
vessel for S' Marks—While at Orleans a part of my time was quite
profitably employed for the government in examining Spanish books &
procuring some suited to my business. After obtaining a vessel for
S' Marks, it was by reason of adverse winds 2 Weeks before I arrived
at the latter place being the 8" of May & immediately Commenced
business—In a few days after I went to Tallahassee & I believe the
whole population of Tallahassee & Surrounding Country as far as they
had an opportunity of witnessing can bear testimony to my unremitted
attention to the interest of the Country.—On my arrival at Talla-
hassee early in May, it was found the Claimants had not yet Com-
menced their suits—They waited untill the last days having untill the
23” of that month to Commence. In the single suit which I had left
in Dec in the Court at Tallahassee the translation of the papers, &
Copying had only been Compleated.—Finding none of the suits ready
for taking despositions my time has been much employed in drawing
answers in the Cases at Tallahassee & West Florida, & it is to me a
source of some gratification that in the answers in all the weighty
Cases such a history & argument (refering to both law & fact) is left
as it is hoped will if followed almost ensure success; & at any rate
greatly assist those assigned to pursue the Cases. I have left nothing
undone which in my judgement Could be in any degree Serviceable to
the government. Believe me Sir I retire from office with perfect
Composure entertaining no unfriendly Spirit towards those well dis-

CAPT: DAN' E. BURCH, Asst: Quarter Master, Pensacola–Florida.—
SIR, I have further to instruct you in relation to the Military Road
leading from Pensacola to Tallahassee."—
That part between Deer Point and Alagua, and that part between
Ocheeses and Tallahassee, will be improved. The intermediate
space, that is, between Alagua and Ocheesee, being so little travelled
as to render repairs of very little use, in fact to make repairs there
would be an unnecessary expenditure of public money, and by confin-
ing them to the two portions named they can be put in a much better
state, than to repair partially throughout.—
Your particular attention is called to the Bridges—pine poles are
not to be used, for they are of such a nature as to render them, by
rotting, good for nothing in a very short time. The Bridges must be
made of Juniper, or light wood and heart of pine.—
The proper places to cross and bridge the Alagua is left to your own
decision.”—

JAMES GADSDEN TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER
[NA:WD, CE Lets. Recd., G 245:ALS]
WAs CISSA 12 July 1828 [1829]
SIR. The result of my examinations of the obstructions to the
inland passage between the S. Johns and S Marys rivers, and of my
agency on the work contemplated for its improvement would long
since have been reported to you,” had I not found from some experi-
ments made on the soft mud forming the obstacles to be removed,
required a reexamination and a change in the plan first decided on—
With the exception of the impediment at the Sisters, which is a bed
of oyster shells, the obstructions at the other three points contained
in the report of the examining engineers to your Department, are
formed by deposits made at the meeting of the tides setting in by the
various inlets on that coast—The operation therefore of the currents
being a continued one and the mud in the bed of the channel being
easily stirred up and as soon deposited, when the cause of its motion
ceases, any removal would be but temporary; and new deposits of
mud might be expected almost as fast as the banks are removed.
The channel at Fort George dividings eentains is of a greater depth
than was contemplated to be given at the Amelia narrows and the
Sisters, the extremities of the inland passage)—I have therefore
directed the appropriation more particularly to those obstructions
and to that at Talbot Island—The Amelia narrows are not only two
miles in extent, but very crooked and narrow, as you may perceive
by the map—It would require to be straitened widened & deepened,
and no work bestowed on it, within the appropriation made, could
have been permanent, or could have admitted a passage for any but

boats—On examination I found that Pine Isle. Creek, a branch of
Belle river and navigable for Schooners of 100 tons burthen almost to
its head, could by a short canal through the marsh be connected with
another creek communicating with the Amelia Sound below the
narrows; and I was the more inclined to this improvement as it might
be made permanent, and could be connected with the more enlarged
views of inland navigation contained in the recent able report of
Gen.' Bernard on the canal connection of the Gulf with the Atlantic
Ocean * —
I could obtain no offers to my proposals for furnishing labor, and
but one offer and that from M. Kingsley for executing the work agree-
ably to the plan last adopted *—An examination of both the beds of
the old channel at the different dividings, as well as the marsh thro
which the contemplated canal was to be excavated: I found that at a
depth corresponding very nearly with the ordinary low tide, and in
some instances 1 foot above it, the basis was soft mud almost in a
semi liquid state, and that any excavations below that depth would
immediately endanger the banks above—It was necessary therefore
to regulate for the present the depth in the canal, as well as that at
the different narrows to be improved, by this fact, though I am
inclined to the opinion that as the weight of the earth placed on the
banks is felt below, a greater depth may be obtained—hereafter—if
otherwise it may be necessary to face the canal & the Talbot narrows
with palmetto logs before a passage for steam boats or vessels of any
magnitude can be effected at common half tide—By the improvements
which will be completed under my agency; boats of the largest class
may pass at common half tide and Wessels of 30 or 40 tons may without
difficulty pass through at low tide—
I have made a contract with M Kingsley to complete the Canal,
deepen the creek with which it communicates; and face its mouth with
a stockade of palmetto logs so as to prevent the formation of sand bars
from the operation of the tides; remove the sand bars from Talbot
Narrows, and remove the shell obstructions at the Sisters for the
appropriation 13,500 dollars—At the time of concluding the contract
I did not advert to the fact of exceeding the appropriation by emolu-
ment; but as this will be inconsiderable, provision can be made, I pre-
sume, before the completion of the work—If otherwise and you would
prefer my doing so: there will be no difficulty in omitting the work at
Talbot narrows untill further appropriations can be obtained for the
more permanent removal of the obstruction at that & other points-

I shall reply very soon. In the mean time I take leave to say that
the question as to the principles involved in the case of Arredondo &
son was one exclusively for the consideration of the late administra-
tion. The Report of the Commissioners had been several years in the
Department and it was their duty & their right so long as the Constitu-
tion confided the execution of the laws to their discretion to see whether
my view of the case corresponded with the facts. The question pre-
sented by me in my letter of the 14" of August * is in my opinion the
only point on which the validity of the title depends & is the only one
I ever intended, or ever shall argue before the Court.
I have received a letter from the District Atto of East Florida in
which he makes the following extract from a letter of yours to him
“Mr Wirt has requested me to furnish you with a debate in Congress
on the subject of British claims. This debate I have not been able to
obtain, but Mr White ought unquestionably and by his own admission
to have furnished you with all the information in his power on the
subject of British claims.” The debate here refered to was one in
which I had the principal participation in opposition to the British
claims, & the newspaper containing it was sent to the Editor of the
Gazette in St Augustine by me and published and if the District Atto
has not seen it it is not to be attributed to my neglect. I requested
him last fall when I went to East Florida and have since written to
him to notify me as soon as any British claim should be filed & that I
would give my personal attention to it. I am now informed that a
number are presented, as well as conflicting Spanish & British titles
between individuals, & although the government are not directly, they
are indirectly interested in the issue. I shall go to St Augustine to
the November Court and attend to them.” The debate refered to was
mentioned by me in your office on the morning of its publication, & I
asked you to read it. However much some persons here and elsewhere,
may be disposed now to undervalue my services I do not hesitate to
say that if it had not been for the Report drawn by me, and the debate
commenced by me that the U States on the principle established in
Mississippi on the subject of British claims would have sustained a
loss of more than a million of acres of land. I assure you sir, that
whatever may be the views of those who compose the present govern-
ment & whatever representations may have been made to them, I
shall honestly & faithfully fulfil my engagements as I have always
done to the satisfaction of those who may be interested. The late

officers appointed here are almost without an exception, personal and
political opponents of mine, with whom I have but little intercourse,
and judgeing from the past I have every reason to apprehend that
every effort will be made to injure me at Washington. I have to re-
quest that as an act of justice, if any representations are made, that
before they are made the foundation of letters to District Attorneys
in which my conduct may be implicated or indirectly censured that
I may be informed of it.
The construction I placed on my contract was one which in my
opinion both the spirit, & letter, as well as the understanding with the
late President warranted; on this subject however I do not desire to
say more at this time. I shall do the duties according to your con-
struction & the government may consider it the performance of the old
engagement, but I shall consider it a service never stipulated to be
performed by me, & if Congress shall entertain the same opinion I
shall look to them for an adequate renumeration.*

TO HIS EXCELLENCY A JACKSON President of the U States.
SIR. There is a grievance & Subvertion of the law practiced in this
region of our government, of which I feel in duty bound to represent
to your excellency. I consider it an erie which concerns and strikes
at the very root of one of the greatest priviledges excercised by free-
men—I allude to the Conduct of John Jackson Esqr. Commander of
the Revenue Cutter Marion on this Station.
At the election for a delegate to Congress held at Indian Key in
this C° on the first monday of May last, Capt. J Jackson permitted
his two Lieutenants Messr" Day” & Harby "to go on shore from the
Cutter under his command with most of the crew of said Cutter for
the purpose of voting. Eighteen of whom did, & the two Lieutenants

said Cutter declined voting in consequence of Lieu" Harby requiring
their vote for Col J M White when it was their wish to vote for Co.'
James Gadsden—By a law of the U States approved the third of
March Eighteen hundred & twenty three, “To amend an Act for the
establishment of a territorial government in Florida,” "it is enacted
“that Soldiers of the U States shall not be entitled to vote.” I
am not at present prepared to say that men serving on board of
U States revenue vessels are soldiers, nor should I like to say so, but
tis my opinion they are embraced under that head, so far as it re-
spects elections
I would further represent to your excellency that at the Election
for a member of the Legislative council held at this place on the first
Monday of June last Capt. J Jackson permitted his two Lieutenants
and the crew of the Cutter under his command to come on shore for
the purpose of voting—The men offered to vote but was refused that
priveledge by the Inspector of the Election—After much wrangling
between the two Lieutenants and the Inspectors, they took their men
from the Poles, disguised them in the garb of common sailors, sent
them back, and most of their votes passed before the cheat was
discovered.
I am well aware it is an evil which your Excellency cannot easily
avert, but I feel I do my duty in representing what I consider improper
conduct in officers of the general government.
I would further draw your excellencys attention to the Circumstance
of Capt Jacksons making a packet vessel of the U States Revenue
Cutter Pulaski, by his going to Havanna to look for & bring a Spanish
claimant for a prize brig that was undergoing adjudication at this
place, the doing of which he knew Would be of serious injury to
Citizens of the U States. He was aware that if some claimant, other
than his two Lieutenants Messrs Day & Harby who had libelled the
brig for salvage (in consequence of their having slept on board of her
as Revenue officers) did not appear she would be given up, & fall into
the possession of citizens of the United States who had legal claims
against her.
In coroboration of the above statements I enclose Certificates from
some of our most Respectable inhabitants.
Finally I would represent to your excellency that if officers & sailors
of the Revenue & Navy are allowed to vote, they can at any election
on the sea coast, return representatives who are not the choice of the
people, who are the actual resident citizens—I would enclose certi-
ficates that the persons who have given certificates concerning the
conduct of Capt. Jackson and his two Lieutenants Messrs Day &

SIR. The undersigned members of the Volunteer Corps, “Florida
Guards” being appointed a Comitee for the purpose, respectfully
represent, that in order to insure permanency in the Establishment of
that Company, it is desireable that it be provided by the Goverment
with a Suitable Stand of Arms & that your Excellency will be pleased
to cause an application to be made to that effect To the propper
Authorities in behalf of the Company. Some of the reason which have
weight in the estimation of the Company & of its Comitee in making
the request are these 1" the absolute necessity of having the Company
provided with Arms & Acoutrements alike without a uniformity in
the arms, the Manuel & accompanying exercise cannot be as perfectly
acquired as with it, the Company is bound by its Constitution to
uniform itself in the Article of dress, but it would be attended with
great difficulty & expense to require it to apply the Same rule to
Arms, Many, we may say the Majority of our Members, have not the
ability to meet such an expense, in addition to that required. in the pro-
vision of even the most economical dress. many have Guns or Fowling
pieces of Some Sort, which do not answer the purpose of Drilling, they
will reluctantly purchase others more suitable while they have any
thing which can be Substituted, the consequence of obliging the mem-
bers to purchase Muskets & Accoutrements, would be the withdrawal of
such as have not the ability to comply, endangering the prosperity
& permanency of the Company. 2dly we would respectfully suggest
to Your Excellency the expediency of Maintaining a well disciplined
Company upon this part of our unprotected Sea Cost, & but a short
distance removed from a race of men, who though at present on terms
of perfect Amity with us, Yet look with a Keen eye of Jealousy upon

glad to inhabit again, recent indications as communicated through the
medium of the publick prints have placed this suggestion in a palpable
light & leave at least some room for apprehension the encouragement
therefore that may be given to those disposed to unite in the formation
of Volunteer Companies would if so extended, operate not only as a
stimulus to their perfection but as an incitement to the whole com-
munity to be organized & Armed for any emergency that may occur,
& such encouragement we doubt not will be considered by Your
Excellency as desireable & worthy of Your recomendation to the
Authorities of the General Goverment—and lastly in the most
respectful manner we would refer to the example furnished by Gov-
erment in relation to the volunteer companies of other Sections of the
Union a part in each State being provided with arms at the publick
expense; this being among the first application for such an object
within our Teritory—we trust that being urged by Your Excellency
upon the Grounds suggested or others which may occur to You, its
prayer will be readily granted. The number Composing the Company
is at present about forty five,that number will be gradually increasing,
The law of the Teritory provides for the number which shall constitute
a Volunteer Corps. & would therefore prescribe the number of Arms
requisite The Company have adopted the Infantry dress & exercises,
Any Security that may be required from the Officers for the careful
preservation of the arms & for their safe return when called for will be

it will remain for you, by a rigid supervision of the operations of the

It is desirable that you should, as early as practicable, examine the

nature and extent of repairs to be bestowed upon it, and make the
necessary arrangements to have them effected. The sum appro-
priated for this object is three thousand dollars, which you will be

to effect a repair of the whole road, it will be applied as far as it will
go towards that object.—It is however very desirable that the road
should be put in good travelling order throughout the whole distance,
if the appropriation can be made to effect it in a proper manner.—I
shall cause the amount appropriated to be remitted to you—and you
may apply a portion of it to the current service to be reimbursed by a

Your having declined to undertake the direction of the contemplated

were it not for the hope that you may be yet induced to undertake
it—If a contract for effecting the improvement could not be made
advantageously and it should become necessary to carry it on by
means to be procured and applied on behalf of the Government the
employment of a person to act as the immediate Superintendent,
under your direction, would relieve you of the necessity of giving
your personal attention to the work except occasionally when it might
be convenient and would not materially interfere with the attention
necessary to be given to your private concerns—If such an arrange-

is agreeable to you the arrangements for giving effect to it may be
made whenever you think it most advisable and the necessary funds
will be furnished upon your requisition—If it be done by Contract the
Contractor will of course provide any machinery or other facilities
that may be necessary but if not done by contract it is considered
that you are authorized to provide them—Perhaps the dredging
machine which has been used for deepening the Channel at Mobile
might be procured on very low terms if there is no further use for it—
The person by whom it was built, Mr John Grant of Baltimore,
furnished one for Sacketts Harbour for $2300 capable of raising from

This makes the 4" time during this summer that I have gone to the
river to remove the obstructions; viz, in the months of May, June,
July and August; and and have been obliged to return from the same
cause. About the latter end of the present month or beginning of next,
the water will, I hope, be low enough to resume operations.
The Account of disbursements and expenditures stands thus at the
present time: viz.
Expense of Reconnoissance $95.00
Work and labor at the river of sticks 600.00
one keel Boat 450.00
Blocks & tackel chains cables &ca &c &c 200.00
$1345.00

All of which items will be presented with their proper vouchers and
requisite forms at when the return of the work is made by me to the
Department.
I have not yet drawn the last remittance of $1500 placed to my
credit in the Branch Bank of the U.S. at New Orleans, now will I
do so, until the work is in a greater state of forwardness. If the
River continues too high on the first week of October, it is supposed
that it will not fall any lower after that period during the present
season. In consequence of the work done at the river Sticks, and
the high stage of the water, the navigation has been unimpeded since
January last, and the beneficial results to the trade & commerce of
the river have been sensibly felt.
I will report again next month.”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY MASTERS AND OWNERS OF
WESSELS IN THE TERRITORY
[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:DS *]
[September 13, 1829]
Memorial to the Hon: the Congress of the United States.
The memorial of the subscribers respectfully represent that they
are masters and owners of vessels engaged and employed in affording
assistance to other vessels which by accident or misfortune get aground
on the reef and numerous shoals & rocks with which the coast of
Florida abound, and for which assistance they expect no other remun-
eration than what may be adjudged by the proper tribunals of their
Country. They cherfully concede that the courts have invariably
manifested a disposition to do justice in all cases, and to all parties
concerned.
But we humbly beg leave to remark that there are many instances
which do, and must occur wherof from the peculiar circumstances
connected with the case we are debar'd from that compensation to
which we are justly entitled.—The remedy can be furnished only by
your honorable body, and for this we humbly pray.
It sometimes happens that foreign vessels and vessels from foreign
ports are driven ashore on the reef, shoals & Rocks before mentioned;
and from their situation cannot be relieved without the aid and assist-
ance derived from the Wreckers, which has been at all times hazard-
ous, tho'—promptly extended—That proper salvage may be deter-
mined on, -it is necessary to take the vessel saved to some port, where
the amount allowed, is upon the appraised value of the Cargo—which,
when named, may, to those who have never examined, and made
themselves acquainted with the subject, appear fully sufficient:
nevertheless, when all the circumstances attending are explained,
proves totally inadequate—For when the duties required by law are
paid, the sum is so reduced as to afford nothing like a reasonable
compensation; and there have been many instances of property found
derelict, and totally abandoned, which was saved at great labor and
difficulty, not yielding one cent to the salvors, in consequence of the
heavy duties to which they were liable, and which for the future,
under existing circumstances, we will be compell'd to abandon, unless
relieved in some manner or mode devised by your honorable body, to
insure some reasonable compensation, for goods wares & merchandize
thus situated, the duties on which, equal or exceeding the value of the
article.—We therefore pray that when goods wares and merchandise

liable to duties, be saved, by any regular wrecking vessel, that such
part which may be adjudged for salvage, be exempt from the payment
of any duty; or at least, an equal percentage from the duties accruing
to the Government from that portion awarded the salvors, as may be
awarded in the aggregate of the Cargo. In requiring this, (which we
deem equitable and just) we will presume to remind your honorable
body, that were it not for our exertions, the great revenue now derived
by Gov' from wrecked property would be entirely lost, —and for
meritorious services thus rendered at the risk of our property &
lives, attended with great labor, we consider ourselves entitled to a
due reward.
Your memorialists further beg leave to represent in behalf of their
petition that they have provided vessels of a superior class, and of a
construction admirably calculated for their occupation, and such as
will enable them to afford assistance, when ever the same is practi-
cable. In doing this we have been compelled to expend our means;
and are moreover, subjected to great expence in maintaining the crews
employed; and are likewise exposed to daily hazard of loosing our
property, while engaged in saving that of others.—We also respectfully
suggest that notwithstanding impressions abroad, there is no business,
where the remuneration is so uncertain as that of wreckers, as it is not
unusual for vessels to cruise a year without meeting any employment-
Your memorialists further represent that the provisions of the law
of Congress " requiring each wrecking vessel to have a licence from
the Judge of the Superior Court ef Admiralty excludes those from the
occupation who are not of a respectable character, and we appeal to
the court of Admiralty at Key West, and every other respectable in-
habitant of that place whether our conduct has not on all occasions
been distinguished for humanity to those in distress; or therebe, a
single instance, where they have not acted with fairness, and fulfill'd
every duty incumbent on them: and before closing our petition we
will advert to the fact, that there has not been a single life lost by
Wrecks on the Coast of Florida since its session to the United States;
but on the contrary several lives have been lost among those engaged
in saving the lives and property ef ethers from Wrecked vessels whilst
actually engaged in saving the lives their humane and laudable efforts
to save others.
Relying on the equity and justice of your honorable body we pray
for such relief only as may be just and proper.—

SIR, It has been represented to me that a large party of Indians
from near the Agency in this Territory have crossed the Suwannee
into this County (Leon), and that they have driven off from their,
Settlements, a M. Cook and a M. Howard, with their families, and
that the Indians have taken their crops of Corn, and killed their hogs
&c. As M. Cook has made these Statements to me, I have deemed it
advisable, to direct the Subagent, Major John Phagan, to take his
Interpreter, and go down where the Indians now are, and to enquire
into the facts. If true, he will report the Same to G. Humphreys,
the Agent, who will be directed to call on the Cheifs, and have the
depredators brought home. I apprehend no serious difficulty, but
deem it proper in time, to put a stop to any disorderly conduct on the
part of the Indians. Should any thing occur, worthy of your notice,
it will be communicated as soon as the information is obtained I am

GENERAL LAND OFFICE, Sept. 22" 1829.
GENTLEMEN, I enclose for your information, a copy of the surveys
of the public Lands in the vicinity of the Barrancas and the Navy
Yard, at the entrance of Pensacola Bay.
The tracts coloured yellow, are represented as private claims but
it is understood that the titles to all of them, with the exception of
that numbered 6. and confirmed in the name of William P. Anderson,
have been purchased up by the Navy Dept. It is also understood
that the claim of F. S. Pintardo * to a tract of land at the West End
of St Rose Island, and which was rejected by the Board of Comm"
has been bought up also, thro’ M White, by the Navy Department.
I would therefore suggest the propriety of reserving, for the present,
for the use of the Navy Dept. and for military purposes, all the Lands
on the East side of the Bay of Pensacola, which lie West of the East
boundary of Fractional Township 2 South, Range 28 West, and all
the Lands on the West side of Pensacola Bay, included in Fractional
Town: 3. South, Range 30. West, and so much of Fractional Town:
3 So:, Range 31 West, as lies South of of the Creek, called Grand Bayou
and East of the private claims in the names of F. Barrios and J. Barella.
These Reservations are marked on the Plat in red lines, that on the
East of the Bay, includes 9053,36/100 Acres, after deducting the

The memorial of the undersigned respectfully shewith, that an
appropriation has been made by the Government, for the continuation
of the public road, from St Augustine in East Florida, to the old
Town of New Smyrna on Moscheto inlet,” and that the said road was
discontinued at Tomoca, on the representation of the officer, who
had the superintendance of the work, that there was no necessity for
a road from New Smyrna to Tomoca, as there were no settlers at the
former place, which was the case at that time, but since then, some
of the undersigned have purchased tracts of land, and are actually at
work, establishing sugar plantations in Turnbulls Swamp, at New
Smyrna, and several who reside in New York, whose names could not
be procured to this memorial, (they being absent) have been here,
and made purchases, and will commence their plantations the ensuing
winter, and that there are very extensive tracts, of very rich lands, in
the immediate vicinity of New Smyrna, which in the course of a few
years will be settled, and as a public road would greatly facilitate the
communication with this place, and as no agent has been appointed,
since the removal of Lieut. Brown, the former agent, Your Memorial-
ists respectfully solicit, that the old road, made by the English Govern-
ment, may be cleared, and repaired, and Bridges built across the

HON: SAMUEL D. INGHAM, Secy of the Treasury:
SIR, I have been informed by Henry Wilson Esquire, late Marshal
of the United States for the Southern district of Florida, that some
objection has been made to the settlement of his accounts for repairs

done to the Court house at this place, in consequence of his not having
received direct authority to make them, and he has requested me to
state the circumstances which led to the expenses incur'd by him for
those repairs.
When I reach'd this Island, I was informed that a house which had
originally been intended for a Naval Hospitality had been given up
by the then Secretary of the Navy to the State department for the
purpose of having it used as a Court house; but upon an examination
of its situation, it was found wholly unfit for use without considerable
alteration and repairs. It had never been finished, & was nothing
more than a shell when M. Wilson received it; besides which, it leaked
badly, was surrounded by an almost impenetrable thicket of under-
wood, and was altogether in a ruinous condition.
It has always (so far as I am informed) been considered a part of
the duty of the Marshals of the U. S. Courts, to provide & furnish
rooms for holding the Courts when none have been provided by the
Government; & the expenses incur'd in doing so have in all cases, I
believe, been allowed in the settlement of their accounts. Without the
performance of this duty it would in many instances be impossible to
hold the Courts; & believing that there could be no difficulty on such
a subject, & indeed, that the Marshal of this district was bound to do
acts so essentially important, I requested him soon after our arrival,
to cause the necessary arrangements to be made for the transaction
of business.
Under these circumstances, & taking into view the fact that the
Hospital had been turned over to him for that express purpose, he
deemed it his duty to cause such alterations & repairs to be made in
that building as were absolutely necessary to make it answer the end
for which it was intended.
In making this alteration & repairs, I believe he had an eye to the
most rigid oeconomy, but from the high price of labor & the difficulty
of procuring materials, the accounts may have been swelled to an
extent beyond his expectations; of this much however, I am certain,
that under the circumstances by which he was surrounded, he could
not have made the building answer the purpose at a less expense than
he incur'd, & it is yet far from being as convenient & comfortable as
could be wished.

dep" at this place, which terminated, with a request that I would
communicate my views on the subject.
Upon my arrival here Maj. Wilson (my predecessor) had left the
Island, consequently I cannot give any satisfactory information rela-
tive to its disposition heretofore; tho’ the result of my inquires are,
that the houses were rented last year generally at a high price in
consequence of the scarcity then, and a particular Spirit of competition
at the time: whether the rents have been collected &" &°, I am unable
to say farther than I have understood that one of the proprietors
claimed ground rent, but all of the circumstances I presume, are filed
in your office.
The Houses erected on this Island by the diferent Naval Officers
of the West India station consisted of a Hospital, Comodores quarters
with several small Houses, a ware House, sail loft &"
The House erected for a Hospital has been fited up for and is now
occupied as a court House, with Clerks and Marshal's Offices; and
those for the commandants quarters, are now, and I believe have
been, since the establishment of this as a port of entry, occupied by
the Collector: The residue are now unocupied and going fast to decay;
the Court House is within the pub. square ie the “donation lot;”
the balance are all on private land claims which makes it the more
necessary that they should be disposed of immediately. —I have con-
versed with one of the proprietors Col. P. C. Green, now on the Island
who assures me that a reasonable time shall be allowed for their
removal by the purchasers, the sale of which, under existing circum-
stances, I would advise; tho' what ever instructions you may think
proper to give me, shall be strictly attended to.”
With due deference allow me, Sir, to avail myself of the present
oportunity to impress on your mind the urgent necessity of some more
effectual provision, than the present; being made at this port for our
destitute mariners. Since my short residence on this Island I have
witnessed more human misery, than I had ever expected to see within
the United States.
There are probably four or five hundred Mariners engaged on this
coast wrecking and fishing, (who like all other sailors, (I believe it a
characteristic trait) are remarkable for their improvidence and reck-
less disregard of future events. Those engaged in the wrecking

Secretary of the Navy, Oct. 24, 1830, Jan. 12 and Feb. 25, 1831 (loc. cit., Captains'

business sometimes receive several hundred dollars as prize money,
which they usually spend in riotous dissipation, and whilst doing so,
they contract the malignant diseases peculiar to this climate, which
will not admit of disipation or exposure.—I have no hesitation in
asserting my belief that a number of those destitute creatures have
died for want of the most ordinary assistance!—The few inhabitants
on this Island, who were able, have extended relief as far as they
could, but which was necessarily limited as they received no assistance
from the hospital fund of this place, that having been expended, long
since; and in a manner that afforded no (Comparative) Relief,-for
want of a regular established hospital, physician and nurses.—surely
our Government is able, and no doubt are willing when properly
advised, to provide for her destitute mariners.—I believe they are
considered in all civilized countries as proper subjects for guardian-
ship, which is evidenced by the exactions of Hospital money &"—I
trust you will pardon me if I have addressed you on a subject with
which you have no official control or influence, but the impressions
left on my mind (in the absence of all reference) are, that the act of
Congress (I think of 1811) makes some provision for all naturalized
seamen of the United States, and leaving it measurably discretionary
with the sec' of the Navy, when, and where, to establish a hospital,
and in the event of that particular fund being inadequate, he is req"
to report, upon which congress will make a special appropriation from
the Treasury of the United States to supply the deficiency.” Beleiv-
ing this to be the law, (in substance) I am induced to address you;—
tho' should I be laboring under erroneous impressions relative to its
provisions, I well know you will excuse the motives that induced me
to trouble you, and that you will cherfully aid in your private or
public character in making some future provision for the object
contemplated, in the absence of any present.
The House belonging to your Dep', occupied at present by the
Collector of this place, is well calculated for a Hospital, and I have no
doubt but the proprietors would dispose of the lot and suitable grounds,
on very reasonable terms for so laudable a a purpose. Any further
information, or assistance that I can render, will be freely given.

GENERAL

PENSACOLA Oct” 16th 1829
GEN' I have the honor to enclose herewith my accounts and
vouchers for disbursements in opening the Road from Pensacola to
Blakely.—Although all the economy possible, and all diligence in
carrying on the work, has been practised. Yet the whole of the Appro-
priation has been necessarily expended in opening the Road to Blakely,
Contrary to my expectations, for I expected there would have been
a part applicable to opening the Road to Mobile Point But I have
found in this case, as in all others of a similar character where no
exact data can be had to base estimates on, that the expense of a work
is more easily calculated at the close than at the Commencement of
it.—By reason of shortening the Road in Crossing many heads of
Branches there was tenfold more work necessary in Bridges and
Causeways than I had anticipated, well acquainted as I was with the
Country generally.—Moreover the Road has been opened in a very
different manner from what I first contemplated.—It is laid out in
straight reaches, each extending as far on the same line as the Country
would allow of, and the Stumps of the trees cut down into the ground
so that a carriage wheel can run directly on to and over them without
jolting or inconvenience.—In fact it is made as well as a Road can be
without being turnpiked; and is so laid out and opened that it will I
am confident be both useful and permanent. Of the first 30 miles
from Pensacola eight miles are opened 32 feet wide—22 miles are
then on an average of 20 feet in width; and the remainder of it being
through the more open Pine Barren, is 18 feet wide.—The whole
entirely cleared of all Stumps and Logs, or any other cause of inter-
ruption whatever. The appropriation having been exceeded $2.11/100
I have in order to Balance and close the Road account charged that
sum in my Quarterly Acc" Curr" on Acc" of Q M* Dept. in Settling
which I trust it will be allowed as a charge, being so trifling in amount,
upon the appropriation on acc” of Q M* Dept.—The only expense
incurred by the U. States for my Superintendance is my Acc" for
transpo. of baggage $23.40/100 as charged in voucher N° 54. of Ab-
stract B. in Accts: on acc” of Q M Dept.—Same Quarter with this.
In closing this letter I beg leave respectfully to state as my opinion
that in a Military point of view Roads should be opened, so soon as
an Appropriation can be obtained from Pensacola to Mobile Point,
and from Mobile Point to Blakely, and more especially the first
named Road.—From my perfect knowledge of these Routes and of
the Country through which they will pass I think that I can say

SIR Acting as a Committee appointed by at a meeting of the
Citizens of Alachua County for the purpose of communicating with
the General Government concerning the helpless and unprotected
condition in which the Inhabitants are left, in relation to the Indians,
by the removal of the garrison from Fort King, we beg leave to hand
a memorial signed by its citizens.
Your good sense will no doubt enable you readily to perceive from
the tenor of this memorial the necessity which exists, of our being
protected by an adequate force, and that too promptly; for already
has report reached us, tho’ not yet properly confirmed, that a family
of the name of Howard have been butchered at Suwanney Old Town
by the Indians—They are moreover buying up all the powder they
can get at unusually high prices
* See post, p. 384.
* Filed with a letter of transmittal from Andrew J. Donelson to the Secretary
of War, Oct. 23, 1829. The latter referred it to Macomb.
* This communication was evidently drawn up in August or September. See
Brooke to the Adjutant General, Sept. 13, 1829 (NA, WD, AGO Lets. Recd.,
B 258), advising that Fort King was too expensive to supply, and urging instead
two infantry companies at St. Augustine from which detachments could be sent
out after Indians. See also id. to id., July 16, 1829 (loc. cit., B 208), stating that
additional quarters would be needed at Cantonment Brooke if the Fort King
contingent were to remain.

F L OR I D A T E R R H TO R Y 283
It may be proper to mention that our settlements are scattered from
the northern boundary line of the Seminoles to the Suwanney and
S’ Marys River. From the manner in which the settlements are
generally located, the junction of the males of any two families at the
house of either would leave entirely exposed the property and family
of the other—From this you may conclude what would be the conse-
quence if all the men were ordered out; Our force would be too weak
to permit its being divided, so that it could be efficient but at one
point at the same moment—while the rest of the county, through which
would be scattered their respective families, would be without the
smallest shadow of protection. And what must be the result of this
fact? Why, that in a case of danger every man will be compelled to
remain at home to protect to the best of his ability with his single arm,
the objects most dear to him, thus leaving it in the power of an enemy
to cut us off peicemeal, or as it were, in detail, with little or no hazard
to themselves.
The only remedy for this state of circumstances which presents itself
to our view, is that proposed in the memorial above referred to.—to
wit. That a garrison of four companies of United States troops be
stationed at Micanopia in this county—By this means whenever an
alarm occured, the Inhabitants from every part of the County would
flock to it with their families, and having deposited them thus in a
place of safety, would be unburthened of his cheif care, and be then
ready to fight the battles of his country. Which would be rendered
more effectual, by the power, which the adoption of this plan would
afford of cooperating with the regular forces.
These advantages were not afforded by the station at Fort King—
being located so far within the boundaries, that in time of war, no
man would have risqued his family through an anemy's country to
have reached; while it had but little power of restraining the Indians
from roaming at large in the Territory of the whites, for from their
situation it was rendered troublesome to send detachments among us—
and when such detachments were sent, they could stay but so short
a time that the Indians had it in their power to conceal themselves
until the danger was past, without the least possibility of detection.
Micanopia is situated about twenty five miles north of the Agency—
and thirty East of the Suwanney Old Town—it is well watered—a
high and healthy situation. The land carriage to the S Johns would
be between forty and fifty miles—one half the distance that was re-
quired for the delivery of the stores at Fort King, until shortly before
their removal—nor will the cost of the Beef and grain required for their
consumption amount to half the expence which was found necessary
for its obtainment at that station.


## p. 284 (#300) ############################################

284 T E R R I TO RIA L PA P E R S
The situation of Micanopia is such that with all ease and convenience
detachments might be constantly kept on duty, which will be the only
possible means of keeping the Indians within their boundary and of
putting a stop to their depredations—while in time of danger it would
be of easy access to all parts of the country—
Again—with regard to the arms requested to be sent among us.
We stand sir in actual need of them. There are not more in our
opinions than one Tenth of our men who could bring into action guns
proper to be used there. Besides which our Regiment is almost uni-
versally desirous of forming into volunteer uniformed companies,
which are generally the most efficient arm of the milita, being better
disciplined, but are prevented from doing so, by their being unable to
obtain regular arms—there being but few public arms at the seat of
Government.
The major part of the force at present stationed at Tampa Bay
might with propriety be removed to this part of the Country—at
Tampa they are of little use or benefit, which will appear to you by a
reference to the map of this country
We might enlarge, Sir, our views to a considerable extent on the
subject on which we have the honor of adressing you, but have con-
cluded that, in resigning the matter, with the few remarks above
submitted, yet r entirely to your own good judgement, we shall have
no reason to fear its reception of proper attention—Yet permit us,
Sir, to add one remark—That we are an integral part of the citizens
of the United States, and stand in need of protection from the General

on our property and lawless conduct have been continued from time
to time.
We have repeatedly complained to the proper authorities of the
Territory—of the impropriety of many of the priveledges granted
to these people; but we are sorry to say without effect. Our situation
at present is alarming, and rendered still more so by a leave of ab-
sence for six months which we are sorry to learn has been granted
the Agent. Within a few days parties of them have been detected
in the fact of plundering our stock, in the very heart of our settlements,
and fifty or sixty miles beyond their boundary.
About four weeks since a deputation from the Creek Nation visited
these Indians—their business unknown, but certain it is, that their
conduct while here was calculated to produce alarm. Since which
time we have been informed that a party of one or two hundred of
them have come among the Seminoles, and still remain there. We
have further, from the Acting Agent M. Sims, information that the
chiefs of the Seminoles were to hold a Council, for what object un-
known, and that their deportment is hostile.
For the protection of our frontiers, and to quell the fears of the
people, we would beg leave Respectfully to request that a garrison
of four Companies of U. S. Troops be stationed at Micanopia, in
this County. Tho' we admit that the company recently stationed
at Fort King had its influence, yet in case of difficulty their efforts
to check the Indians would have been of little avail being twelve
miles within the boundary, and affording no possibility of protection
to our families, or of co-operation with our militia.
We would beg leave further to request That, One Thousand stand
of Arms with ammunition, may be sent to the Col. of the sixth Regi-
ment of the Florida militia, in this county, to be distributed to those
who may not be supplied with arms.

JUDGE SMITH TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:ALS]
ST AUGUSTINE District of East Florida 18 Nov. 1829.
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
SIR, I have recently been informed by William Levinston, a present
resident of this city, who has lately returned from a visit at Washing-
ton, that while there he had the honour of a personal interview with
the President, and that on that occasion he learnt that a memorial
had been received by you from Joseph S Sanchez, containing com-
plaints or charges against me as Judge of this District.”
It is painful to me Sir, that complaints should be preferred against
me from any source, whatever may be its character, or however
unfounded the complaints may be—it is far more so, when it is feared
they have made unfavourable impressions against me on your mind.
But I rely Sir, on your justice, and on a consciousness of having acted
on all occasions in my judicial capacity with great care, and with the
strictest fidelity; and I do believe that a plain and true statement,
which I am able now to make, with such documents as the suddenness
of the occasion will permit me to collect, must change the unkind
sentiments, which this Mr. Levinston boasts you entertain in regard
to me, and convince you that misrepresentation and cruel calumny
have been practised to do me the greatest injury.
So far as I could learn from Mr. Levinston, the complaint had
relation principally to a judicial proceeding against Rafael D. Fontané,
José Elzaurdi and Joseph S. Sanchez—and perhaps also, to two
several occurrences that took place, the first in 1824, almost six
years ago, where a person by the name of Coe was concerned, and the
other in 1826, nearly four years since, in which a Mr. Cox * was the
party—neither of these transactions had any connexion with official
duties; still, anxious to avoid difficulty with any person, I sincerely

of prudence on my part—for in both instances I was attacked per-
sonally, and with great violence, and am not conscious that I was
guilty of any fault, unless it be so to defend myself. I speak of these
transactions with the more reluctance, because both of the persons
have been some time dead—and both of them, before that event,
exonerated me from blame, told me their feelings were not unfriendly,
and the latter especially, that he had been instigated by others, and
not actuated by his own feelings in the attack upon me: that such
was the fact, as to the complaint made by M. Coe, no one here, I
believe ever doubted. I attended Sir, the dying bed of the one—and
contributed, before his death, to relieve the necessities of the other:
no unkind recollection rests on my mind respecting them, and I cannot
therefore now willingly, even in my own defence, utter a reflection on
either. But the circumstances I have stated, show the unworthy
motives of the complainant, in making these matters, at this time, a
ground of imputation against me, more especially, when among the
files of the House of Representatives, or in the Office of State, a
document may be found with the volunteered signature of this very
complainant, joined with that of almost every individual of his
community, testifying in the strongest terms to my merits, with a
view to this very transaction in which M. Coe was concerned, at a
time during my absence from the district, when it was understood, it
had been made a subject of secret accusation against me.
I need only add, that the evidence relating to it, was submitted at
an early period, both to the President of the United States, and to
the Judiciary committee of the House, and by neither was my conduct
deemed blame-worthy.
As to the affair with M Cox, it has never, unless at the present
moment, been a ground of complaint against me, M Cox having
I believe uniformly, since it happened, exonerated me from blame,
and repeatedly declared that I could not have acted on the occasion,
otherwise than I did.
I will pass from these subjects, to that which I understand has
been the chief cause of the complaint, the Judicial proceeding against
the complainant and against Rafael Fontanë and José Elzaurdi
already mentioned. This Sir, is a recent transaction, and I can have
no difficulty in completely evincing its character. The documents
herewith transmitted prove an outrage committed by these persons,
in grossness and daring violation of Law and decency, rarely equalled
in any country, and which in this district none could have been found
sufficiently irresponsible and destitute of moral restraint, but them-
selves, to have practised.

They also show a forbearance, and discrete exercise of my authority
as a magistrate, which I truly believe, when known, You Sir, will
applaud. It will be seen, that I was careful to call to my aid the
respectable magistrates of the county and city—to advise with them,
and that from their advice, I deviated in no particular—that the
delinquents were mildly dealt with, and where there was doubt, the
most lenient course pursued—and under the circumstances, I may
be pardoned in adding, that I was dispassionate, even where passion
might have been expected and excused—that my duty as a magistrate
was discharged in a manner strictly legal and according to precedent,
where error would not have been just cause for accusation, and that
my conduct was entitled to, and received the decided approbation of
all the moral and respectable people of this community.
These documents Sir, while they prove the correctness of my own,
as conclusively establish the misconduct of the complainant, and the
bad motives by which he has been governed in his accusations,
whatever they may be, made against me. These motives are further
elucidated, by his attempt, disrespectful even to you Sir, to procure
a publication of his memorial in the National Telegraph, for the
purpose of subjecting me to public odium, at the same time that he
transmitted it to you, for your consideration and decision. For the
correctness of this assertion, I beg to refer to the Editor of the Gazette
named.
I am unwilling Sir, to speak lightly of the character of any person:
but where it is warranted by truth, in self defence I may be justified
in saying, that Simeon Sanchez' accusation against me, in this com-
munity where he is known, and where it is known that he is wholly
reckless of right or wrong, and void of every sort of responsibility,
would be esteemed as entitled to the least possible consideration.
Rafael Fontanè his associate, and William Levinston have both been
at the seat of Government: S*Augustine has certainly been unfortu-
nate in these representatives—The first name of the first is synoni-
mous with nothing reputable, and since I have been in this country,
has never failed, I believe for a single term, to be borne on the criminal
docket of the court. How much credit ought to be yielded to the
latter in any representation he may have made in regard to me, may
be determined by the statement concerning him which accompanies
this letter. -
How far persons like these, are to be favoured in complaints which
they may chuse to prefer against judicial or other officers, I have no
right to say, but I submit Sir, to your discernment, whether they
may not be encouraged to an extent, not only grievous and harrassing
to the officer, distressing to his family and unjustly injurious to

character—but subversive also, of subordination to the laws and of
judicial firmness and independence.
I will not detain you longer Sir, than barely to remark, that I have
now been in the district, in my present office, more than seven years.
The peculiar materials, unquiet and discordant, generally marking
the population of a new Territory, cannot have escaped your observa-
tion—Here, to talent and enterprise, often exhibited, but not as often
well regulated, to the mere adventurer, and to persons who have left
their former abodes for any cause, is added the remnant of a Spanish
people, who I certainly would be the last to reproach, but who, just
released from the despotism of Spanish rule, under our free institu-
tions, do not always exhibit a capacity to submit to Laws, whose
sanctions, widely different from the arbitrary mandate of a Provincial
Governor, rest almost exclusively in the moral sense of the community.
Thus situated, and where the judicial has been the only restraining
power, the Territorial Executive influence never having been seen or
felt in the district, and where too, this judicial power has been vested
in a single Judge, his duty must indeed have been difficult and arduous.
Such Sir has been mine—and during the years passed here, that I
should have escaped without difficulties and without, at times, cavil
being excited against me, ought not to have been expected, and would
have been inconsistent with the existing state of society. In every
part of the Territory difficulties have arisen—Judges have been
attacked and abused. In this county Justices and other magistrates,
amiable in character, and honest in office, have been attacked con-
temned and beaten—my accusers, being always on such occasions,
conspicuous actors. The same course has been attempted upon me—
and it is now attributed as a fault, that I would not submit to be
abused and beaten. I have laboured Sir, in the discharge of my
duties, without yielding to fatigue—I have endeavoured to administer
the Laws faithfully and impartially—uniformly to support order and
peace—to sustain the moral and religious institutions of society—to
serve and benefit the people of the district—and though complaints
are made against me—I beleive they are from the bad, and from a
very small part of our community, and I have the consolation of being
assured, from many sources, that the moral, the intelligent, and the
respectable, perhaps indeed nine-tenths of all the people of the dis-
trict, reward these exertions with their esteem and approbation. I
may state these things Sir, without the imputation of arrogance, when
under accusation—In other circumstances I should be silent.
I trust Sir, that my communication, and the documents with it,
may be received, and be favoured with a candid examination. I
ardently hope they may be satisfactory to you—and I pray Sir, that

whatever disposition may be made of the memorial against me, that
these may accompany and be filed with it.
It is my intention to repair to Washington, the moment official
duties will admit of my absence from the Territory—but constant
terms in the district, followed by the court of Appeals at Tallahassé,
demand my time till the middle of January, after which, if further
explanation be necessary, I hope I may in person be permitted to

pose of inquiring into and deciding on the several Charges alledged
against them as above stated—Whereby all further proceedings there-
in at the time were wholly interrupted and suspended—
And said Fontané, Sanchez, and Elzuardi were each of them guilty

that the Judge there of “should be put down”!—in refusing to obey
its lawful orders, and openly and loudly declaring they would not pay
any regard to the said Court – in applying various opprobrious epi-
thets to the Court, charging it with injustice and tyranny—in cursing,
threating and abusing a witness before the Court when inquired of
as to a fact by the Judge, and in endeavouring to intimidate the Judge

by shaking at him in an angry and threatning manner their clinched
fists—
And the said Sanchez was guilty of further contempt and outrage
against the Court, by openly declaring that “the Judge was a tyrant”
that he had but a short time to remain”—“that he should be put
down”, and that he the said Sanchez “would put him down”—
Accompanying these opprobrious charges with violent imprecations
and menacing gestures and and also with shaking a Large Cane at
the said Judge-
And the said Fontané and Sanchez, were guilty of further Contempts
in openly and loudly charging the Judge with falsehood while making

mischeiviously inclined, and that they will materially thereby affect
the peace and happiness of the settlement and have requested that a
post might be established somewhere in the interior, in order to check
the restless disposition evinced by the Indians.—
The Army being already too much broken up into small detach-
ments, it is not considered to be beneficial to incur further expense
in the Peninsula of Florida, by the establishment of additional posts
there, under present circumstances; but I am instructed by the
General in Chief to say to you, that you will consider it your duty,
to watch over the interests and peace of the inhabitants of the Penin-
sula, and that should any interruption of them by the Indians, be
reported to you, you will ascertain the fact and protect the inhabi-
tants; but at the same time, will take care to involve no extraordinary
expense. The show of a detachment of one company where there
may be disorders, will be sufficient to keep the Indians in order should
they manifest any disposition to be mischeivous. It is presumed an
excursion could be made at any time by a company, lightly armed and
equipped for a short tour of service, without any considerable expense,
and it is such a movement, which is contemplated as all that will
be required to keep peace in the Peninsula and which you are author-
sed to make."

APPALACHICOLA RIVER Dec 5" 1829.
SIR I have the honor to inform the Department that the hands
employed under my direction in clearing out and removing the
obstructions on the Appalachicola River, are doing well, and we have
succeeded in making the river more easily navigable for Steam Boats
for the distance of 75 miles from the Bay. As long as the water con-
tinues low I shall continue operations, which however, I am afraid
will not be longer than the end of this month. We have been at work
since the 25" of September, with from 10 to 15 hands, and I have the
satisfaction of informing the Department that the navigation has been
so far as we have gone, been materially improved. The operations

have been confined principally to that part of the river, called the
“Narrows” and “the river of Sticks.” Freights on the River have
diminished one third in price and will no doubt diminish much more
the ensuing season, when all the obstructions are removed. I am
inclined to think that the present appropriation of $3000, will not
be sufficient for the object for which Congress passed the Law.” There
will have been paid laid out and expended on the river during the last
and present year, on the 25* Instant, about the sum of $2400, leaving
an unexpended balance, besides, keel Boats flat Boat chains cables
&a &a of $600: not counting my per diem allowance and percentage.
Now the question is, whether the above sums unexpended, will be
sufficient to finish the river. or whether it will be adviseable to go
on again next season with only this small sum to expend. or whether
it would not be more proper to advise the proper authorities of the
fact of this insufficiency in order to obtain another appropriation to
complete the object. This then is the object of this letter to the
Department. Experience has shown me, altho' I was formerly other-
wise of opinion, that the sum of $3000 is not sufficient to carry into
complete effect the object of Congress.
It would require about $2000 more to render the river safe for the
navigation of steam and other Boats. and I am warranted in saying
that the above sum only will compleate it. I refer the Department

GEN' I have the honor to forward herewith my accounts and
vouchers for Expenditures on account of appropriation for repairing
Road from Pensacola to Tallahassee."
I had made my calculations when furnishing Provisions to the
Working party on the Road, so as to Carry them up to about the 1"
of December; knowing that the expenses must by that time absorb
the appropriations; And accordingly drew them off the Road on the
sixth Inst—discharged all hands, and closed the accounts.
The Season has been uncommonly fine during the whole time they
were at work so that none of the labor of the hands has been lost in
consequence of bad weather.—The Road was so much grown up and
the Bridges and Causeways so delapidated that the whole had to be
entirely renewed.—The Bridges are built of the best materials the
Country afforded—the causeways entirely covered with earth—And
the whole calculated to stand for some Years, unless in case of extraor-
dinary freshets; And when such occur no kind of work will stand their
force.—Every practicable economy was used, and as much work
obtained from the hands as could possibly be, by Judicious Manage-
ment of their labor, but the hands were necessarily withdrawn from

the accounts, $145.62/100, which I have turned over to Judge Bracken-
ridge at his request, to be expended in Bridging the Alagua Creek, the
receipt for which is filed with my Quarterly account Current.—
He will superintend the construction of the Bridge, and select the
Site for its location, which will not be that of the former one on the
Military Road; it being necessary to enter the Settlements of Alagua,
to deviate from that Road and cross the Creek some miles higher up;
After the Bridge is finished he will furnish me with the necessary
receipts for the expenditure of the money in order to my having the
necessary credits at the Treas Depart".—
When this Creek is Bridged all that was necessary in the repair
of the Road, (having determined to deviate from the old Military
Road before reaching the Alagua Creek & cross it at the Settlements,
and there terminate the work on the Western end of the Road,)
will have been done; because that part of the Road from Tallahassee
Westwardly towards Ocheesee passes through Settlements and is
kept in good repair—indeed at the two principal Rivers, Ocholockony
and Little River Fall Bridges have been erected by private proprie-
tors.—

WASHINGTON Dec 10th 1829
SIR, By an Act passed in 1826-7" for the settlement & confirma-
tion of private land claims in East Florida it was provided that the
holders of claims over 3500 acres should connect their surveys with
the Township plats &c—The object of this provision was to prevent
the sale of private unsettled claims as public Lands—By the Act of
1828 a certain number of claims were confirmed to the extent of a
League Square on certain conditions. It is certainly incontrovertible
that as soon as the condition was complied with it became a private
confirmed claim & must be surveyed as such—The Surveyor General of
Florida however still insists that the claimants must at their own
cost & by their own Surveyors still connect the little survey with
the Township plats-For what object I cannot immagine—Congress
have confirmed their claims & under a general law, providing for the
Survey of private confirmed claims they wish their lands surveyd—
I am requested by Henry Michilet of Pensacola to solicit your atten-
tion to this subject & to request that instructions may be given for
the survey—The claim of Bonal has not yet been surveyd & is in
the same neighborhood of that of Michilet & can be surveyed by the
same Deputy—It is a matter of great interest to the U States, the
Territory & the claimants that these orders be given immediately—
Will you be so obliging as to hurry the Report of the Register &
Receiver of East Florida.

DEAR SIR. I trust that you will not deem our acquaintance so

My commission as U. S. Attorney for the District of West Florida
expires on the twenty ninth inst, and I have reason to believe that
attempts have been made and will be made to prevent my re-appoint-

are to be supported I have no means of knowing; nor would it perhaps
be necessary to trouble you with a detail of them if I had Permit me
however to ask of you the favor to speak with M. Van Buren on the
Subject
My Office is of little value and I had intended to decline a re-
appointment to it But the Act of Congress authorising the Courts of
the Territory to adjudicate the Land claims of Florida,” by devolving
upon me the almost exclusive management of the defence in the
important claims within my district, has occasioned me much trouble
and research for which, should I be left out I would probably be
deprived of all compensation, as I have already been of the privilege
of appearing on behalf of the claimants. Allow me to say also that
the interests of the government in this particular might suffer mate-
rially if an individual unacquainted with these claims should now be
appointed in my stead

WASHINGTON CITY December 14 1829
SIR You will perceive by the Memorial that I handed to you
yesterday, in regard to the establishment of a mail rout from the
Seat of Gov' to Key West," the petitioners are anxious to make
Charleston (SC) the distributing office, which would certainly be
very desirable, inasmuch as the mail could be carried to Key West
by that rout several days sooner than via Tallahassee, but as the
expenses in carrying it the latter rout would be considerably lessened.
I do not suppose they would have any particular objection to its being
sent that way—I am not prepared to say what the mail could be
carried from either Charleston or Tallahassee for twice a month, but
I should suppose that it could be done from Charleston for about
$4000, and about $2000 or 2500 from Tallahassee *—
There is another subject to which I beg leave to call your attention—
It is the dividing line between the Collection districts of St Augustine
& Key West, The two Ports are nearly 500 miles apart, and the
jurisdiction of the Collector at Key West only extends to Cape Sable
and the Islands nearest thereto, which is not more than 40 miles
from Key West as you will see by a referrence to the law which was

Johnson, chairman of the House Committee on Post Office and Post Roads,
Mar. 16, 1830 (NA, PO, PMG Lets. to Cong.), presenting information regarding
proposed new post roads, reported on Florida as follows:
“In Florida it is proposed to establish a route from Charleston—S. C* to Key
West in Florida—If the intention is to go by water it would convert the ocean
into a post road; but the P M Gen' has already ample power to provide for the
transportation of the mail by water—If by land it is already established to St
Augustine and the list contains a route from St Augustine to Key West. This is
therefore omitted—
There is also a route proposed from Augusta in G* by Tallahassee & St Marks
to Key West, which is included in the list; but it will be a most expensive route
as proposed & it is worthy of consideration whether it will not be better to omit
it except from Tallahassee by St Marks to Key West, there being already a route,
tho' more indirect from Augusta thro' G" to Tallahassee—”

from your letter that the Surveys in question would be suspended
and my accounts proceed in their regular train of Settlement; and
being anxious to place full and accurate information before you, I
have been waiting the arrival of two deputy Surveyors who are
interested in these Surveys when my report would have been made
for your decision.
By reference to the Surveys on the Escambia, it will be found
that the parallels of the Townships on the East are South of those on
the West, and the Range inself Somewhat narrowed on the North,
which Arises from the following causes: Wiz, In running the parallel
in 1824–5, the waters were extremely high and the Season inclement—
the distance across Black water and Escambia Bays about 6% miles,
Ret:Hääg di-wieliag thena on the parallel & nothing but marsh in which
the Surveyor and hands were frequently obliged to help each other
out of the Mud: the observations taken across these bays by means
of Flags, in all probability were imperfect and a variation north from
the true line might have been the consequence.
When the Surveys were ordered to be executed in that quarter
the Swamps of the Escambia were impracticable owing to high
waters; in consequence of which I directed a Meredian to be run
from the first Township Corner, west of Said river, and the Surveys
to proceed west. When the Range in Question Come to be run out
Subsequently the facts above Stated developed themselves, Yet I
am persuaded that the Surveys on the river are correctly made,
That this Range, should have narrowed on the north will readily
occur to you as a matter not to be Controuled from the circumstance
of Several Surveyors being engaged in running the Ranges from
Tallahassee to the point on the east, and a new Meredian extended
on the west of said river it would have been a miracle to have fitted
them exactly. With these explanations and a reference to the returns
forwarded you, I am in hopes they will prove satisfactory."

informed him of various reports unfavorable to the character of John
Dean lately appointed Marshal of the Southern District of Florida *—
The President assured me, in a manner which whilst it evinced his
elevation of character was highly satisfactory to me, & will be, to
those I represent that if improper persons had been recommended &
appointed, & he could be satisfied of the fact, that he would himself
correct the evil by substituting honest & competent men—He
requested me to submit the nature of the complaints against M. Dean
which are as follow.
I was informed by M. James M*Mullin of the firm of Wellford &
McMullin late of Baltimore, & now of Tallahassee that John Dean
was a clerk in their store, & that after he left their employment
various errors were discovered, in their books which impressed him
most unfavorably towards the honesty of the said Dean, & he does
not hesitate to express his belief that he is not an honest man-
I also saw a letter from a most respectable merchant of Baltimore to
Mr MeIMullin saying that Dean was in that City Shortly after his
appointment endeavoring to borrow money to get to Key West,
saying that he had expended all his in Washington in procuring his
security—This Gentleman added that such appointments would be

extremely injurious to the administration—M*Mullin is a man of as

perceived that this immence amount of property is, or will be in the
hands of an individual of at least doubtful, & suspicious character

I was encouraged with the hope, as expressed in my report of October
last; * that the Contractor would enable me to close my agency under
your department by this time—M Kingsley however was called
north in November, and his agent not understanding some precau-
tionary instructions I had transmitted herein, deemed it most prudent
to suspend the work at Amelia narrows untill his employers return—
This became the more necessary from the difficulty of operating to
advantage during the high autumnal tides—By this days mail I
received a letter from M Kingsley stating that he would resume
work late this, or early the next month, and would be prepared for
my final inspection of the improvement of the Inland navigation in
February next-
The delay has been advantageous as affording time for the banks
to settle, and an opportunity to the Contractor of judging of the
effects of the current and of applying the proper remedy
I have just received over the signature of the Secretary of War (but
not untill after I had sat down to make out my accounts for the
closing quarter of this year) Copies of two sections of the acts of
Congress of January 1823 relating to disbursing officers,” and regret
that you should have deemed so delicate a hint of my supposed public
obligations at all necessary—The penalties in the 3"Section, you must
be aware can have no terrors for me, other than the accompanying
implication of what I never was & never will be a public defaulter,
and in postponing the closing of my accounts, for the reasons stated
above, I feel a conviction that the public interests have not been

“District of East Florida County of Alachua Superior Court for
December 1829.
“Grand Jury Room, the 26" day of December 1829.
“The Grand Jury for the County of Alachua, considering it both a
right and a duty to express their opinions on matters interesting to the
public, and especially to their own County and District; beleiving also,
that the exercise of this right, and the discharge of this duty, in a
cautious and deliberate manner, is often advantageous to the com-
munity in obviating evils, and promoting benefits, take the liberty to
represent—That they are of opinion, from a knowledge of the localities
and character of the Country, contiguous to the public, commonly
called Bellamy's road, that the repair and renewal of that road East
from this Court House to Picolati on the St. John’s River, will be
attended with no advantage or convenience to the public. They are
of this opinion, because the district through which this road passes,
more than sixty miles in extent, is without a settlement upon it, and
will probably long remain in this state;—because it terminates at a
point on the River, where there are no inhabitants—where the river
itself, is exposed to bleak winds, is of great width, and generally
impassable, and where, as no ferry has been recently kept, none can
be expected with any certainty in future;—and because, if this road
should be again opened, it would again grow up, for want of use, as it
has already, since it was cut and cleared by Bellamy, in 1826.”
“The Grand Jury, therefore, beg leave to recommend, instead of a
waste on this road, of the public money appropriated by the munifi-
cence of the General Government, that it be employed and expended
in the highly useful and beneficial purpose of Clearing, straightening
and improving the public road from this Court house to Jacksonville
on the S" Johns—A route of the first necessity, and which does, and
will continue to command and accomodate more travel, than any
other in East Florida.”
“The Grand Jury respectfully request, that a Copy of their present-
ment, as to this road, be transmitted, by order of this Court, to the

[NA:SD, Applications: ALS]
WASHINGTON Jan 4* 1830
SIR, When I proposed to address a communication to you on a
subject as I conceived demanded by a sense of public duty to my
constituents I did not suppose an opportunity would have been af-
forded me of a personal interview with the President—After I had
commenced, & before I had completed the letter of which the en-
closed was the commencement, I was invited to visit the President
with a view to a conversation on the public affairs of Florida.
I availed myself of that occasion to say what I intended to have
added to the letter which I Should have asked the favor of you to lay
before him—I found that he had already received letters from the
Territory on the subjects most interesting to the people there, & on
the points that I desired Should be presented to him.
I have been led to believe that my interferance was considered
rather intrusive and unauthorized by perhaps some of the functionaries
of the govement-As the motives & grounds of my petition or re-
monstrance, are disclosed in this unfinished communication, I have
thought proper to submit it to your candid consideration—I hope
while it evinces a disposition on my part to maintain the rights which
belong to my official Station, it will not be found to claim an improper
assumption of authority, or to set up unauthorized & preposterous
pretentions-
I beg leave to assure you that no personal, or official disrespect has
ever been intended by me to any of the high officers of the Govement,
& that the only motive I have at this time in submitting this paper,

[Endorsed] Florida Appointments White, J. M. Jan 4. 30. The
Delegate of of Florida
[Enclosure]
Delegate White to the Secretary of State
WASHINGTON Dec 28th 1829.
SIR, In our recent personal interview, you did me the honor to
request a written communication, relative to the appointments in
Florida, assuring me at the same time, that whatever I might have to
suggest on that subject would be favorably received by yourself and
submitted with your best reflections, to the pleasure of the President,
who might also be expected to bestow on it his respectful considera-
tion.
Relying on this assurance, and regarding it as an invitation to lay
before the Executive the wishes and feelings of my constituents, I
should not manifest a proper sensibility to my rights and duties as
their Delegate, if I forebore to express their sentiments with that
frankness which belongs to the occasion, and is equally due to them,
to you, to the President, and to myself—The population of Florida
consists almost entirely of emigrants from Virginia, North and South
Carolina and Georgia, principally from the two latter States. It
must be known to you that they cherish in common with their country-
men certain views of policy, and principles of legislation which have
been familiar to them from their youth and are inseperable from their
existence.
It cannot have escaped your attention that the people of the South
receive few offices from the General Government and derive little
advantage from its patronage or expenditure—I submit how far on
principles of sound policy it is proper to increase an inequality al-
ready existing, and to agravate the evils of our condition by sending
among us those who are strangers to our habits, aliens to our institu-
tions, feelings, and if you please prejudices, incapable of entering
into our interests, and not always able to suppress opinions dangerous
to our peace, and distructive to our rights to property.”
I firmly believe that three fourths of the whole population of Florida
are much and justly dissatisfied with the appointments made there-
* See Gadsden to the Vice President, Aug. 12, 1829 (Jameson, ed., Corr. Cal-
houn, pp. 814-816).

In saying this I mean only to speak their language, and that of truth
without disguise and without offence, untinged even in the form of
expression by any feelings of local or general faction, private interest,
or personal resentment—
It is more than conjectured that the provincial party opposed to
me are at least as much discontented as my friends—They have not
concealed their chagrene from officers of the Government, and I am
informed that their complaints have even reached the ears of the
President himself—such a coincidence of opinion between those who
concur so seldom, is no slight proof of the depth and universality of
the feeling I have attributed to my constituents. While expressing
as I am bound to do their disappointment and mortification, I feel
it my duty also to state, that I have never desired to exert, or at-
tempted to acquire a personal influence in appointments for the Ter-
ritory—I have always had at heart the selection of able and honorable
men, and next to this I have insisted that the wishes and interests
of the people of Florida should be respected—Heretofore, fortunately
I have succeeded in procureing the general recognition of this prin-
ciple, and when, which has been seldom, circumstances were suffered
to require a departure from it, such forbearance, circumspection, and
delicacy have been exhibited as became the public functionaries of a
generous and powerful Government, toward the humble agent of a
helpless, distant and dependent province.
Whether there is any peculiar exigency at the present moment
calling for a change in the favorable dispositions heretofore displayed
to the people of Florida, or how far under given circumstances any
administration may feel bound to overlook the preferences of those
in whose country, and for whose benefit and Government, offices have
been created, are questions which I have not the slightest disposition
to agitate.
Whenever it shall be determined that it is expedient to make
Territorial appointments without respect to the wishes of the Terri-
tory, or the formality or a reference to its only authorized agent here,
such agent cannot be expected to intrude information, or volunteer
opinions, and the Government assuming the responsibility from which
he is exempted, relieve him from a burthensome and invidious portion
of his duty-
That the mind of the President has been prepared to receive with
distrust any recommendation of mine on the subject of offices in
Florida, or at least that efforts have been made to effect that object
there can be no question. In the first conversation I had the honor
to hold with him, he intimated that there was so much divission
among 115* and so many complaints of each other, that the Govern-
ment would form unfavorable opinions of all, and be compelled to

select its officers from abroad—I am not aware that my friends or
myself are justly liable to be comprehended in this remark, and I
claim an exemption from its force for them and for myself—I declare
and appeal not only to the files of the Departments, but to the rec-
ollection of those who filled them, to sustain the declaration that we
have never under this, or the preceeding Administration wearried the
high officers of the Government with our local bickerings, or loaded
their Bureaus with our complaints and recriminations. If the mur-
mers of the minority have been so numerous as to draw down upon
the whole the censure due only to a part, I most sincerely deplore
an incident which by creating disgust here, may injure those who are
not at all responsible for it.—
If I can be permitted to have access to the complaints which I have
most respectfully solicited, and the President and yourself amid your
other more important duties, can find time to indulge me with a full
and frank discussion of the subject, I pledge myself to remove every
unfavorable impression against my own course, and that of those
who elected me.—
I think I understood from the President in the same conversation
that there were no removals except for oppression or defalcation—
The conversation was interrupted by company and I might have mis-
taken his meaning. If charges of this discription have been made
against the twelve officers removed in Florida, the oppression or de-
falcation was unknown to the people of the Territory—
It is due to the Executive that no motive of delicacy should prevent
the disclosure of charges which produce a removal, since odium may
thus unjustly be diverted from the faithless servants to the vigilant
and unspareing guardians of the commonwealth—
In relation to the merits or demerits of the removed, however, it
is unnecessary to speak, since I learned from our interview that to
reinstate them was impossible. If then there can be no restorations
on account of the condition of our Territory, and is deemed proper
to exclude its inhabitants from office, I submit for the reasons before
stated the propriety of making a selection among Citizens of those
States whence our population is derived.
The characters, talents, and qualifications of the prominent men
there, are known to our people and will bespeak for them the public
confidence and respect, and a similarity of interests and opinions
between the public agents and the population cannot fail gradually
to restore harmony to our society, and to improve and consolidate
all our institutions.”

GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter
from Lt & Aid de Camp Cooper dated on the 30 Nov 1829,” which
letter relates to a subject of very deep interest to the citizens of
Middle and Eastern Florida, and also places the officer Commanding
in the Peninsula of Florida in rather an awkward predicament, as it
exacts certain duties of him without placing the adequate means in
his hands, or without giving him sufficient latitude, to effect the
object in view. A pretty correct knowledge of the Topography of
Florida, the character, views, and interest of its inhabitants, as well
as the character, disposition, and wants of the Creek & Seminole
Indians, enables me to form a tolerable correct estimate as to the
least expensive, and most certain mode of giving safety to, and

would be required for the road from Pensacola to Marianna and $2000 to $2500
for the road from St. Augustine to Tallahassee. The Quartermaster General

$35oo (loc. cit.).

quieting the fears and apprehensions of the Citizens of this new and
interesting section of the Union.
Altho' I am Hatteh strongly in favor of keeping the Companies of a
Regiment as much together as possible, I am of opinion that in the
present case, it would be much more to the interests of the service,
and more likely to effect the object in view, to have a company
stationed near the Indian boundary, than to have one occationally
sent from this post-In coming to this conclusion, I have been gov-
erned by the following reasons. A company permanently stationed
near the boundary line, would keep the Indians in awe, and prevent
them in a great measure from making their predatory excursions into
the settlements, and if any depredations were committed on the Citi-
zens, and complaints made, the commanding officer, if vigilent and
efficient, could intercept them before they could return to the Nation—-
This post is distant from one hundred and twenty, to one hundred
and fifty miles from the settlements usually visited by the Indians,—
the latter could if so disposed, commit the greatest outrages on the
persons and property of the Citizens, and return to their hiding places,
before the commanding officer could be apprised of the facts. The
country between this post, and the settlements is generally low, and
during the summer and fall months, the water is scarce, and of very
bad quality, & should it be found necessary to detach a company
during those months, it is believed that the health, if not the lives of
the men would be endangered by it.
On the score of economy a decided preference, will be found in favor
of the location of the Company—This opinion is strengthened by the
enclosed statement, made by Assistant Commissary Lieut Newcomb,”
which I beg leave to submit to your consideration—
Lieut Newcomb was stationed some time at Fort King, and is a
young officer of high promise—The quarters at Fort King could be
reoccupied at very little expense, or if a more eligible and convenient
site, can be found, at or near a place on the Ocklawaha river, known
as Paynes landing (and from every thing that I can learn, I am in-
duced to believe such a site can be found) temporary log huts, could
be erected in fifteen or twenty days at a very small expense to the
government. This proposed site is fifty miles by water from the S*
Johns River, and about twenty five by land–It is fifty below Fort
King by water, and about fifteen by land, and I feel confident that
an active and efficient officer, with twenty five or thirty men, could
90 Present.

clear it out, and make it navigable from the S. Johns to Paynes
landing, for the largest class of boats, or small schooners, in fifteen
or twenty days. This object being accomplished, the Troops at
that Post taking every thing into consideration, could be supplied
on as good terms, as they could at S*Augustine.
Lieut Graham ” who has command of the company engaged in
repairing the military road, between this and the agency, and who
is a most active and efficient officer, informs me that he expects to
complete it, by the last of February, after which should the company
return to this Post, they will have to erect quarters, as their are only
quarters for four companies,—I therefore have the honor to recom-
mend, that after the object for which the Company was detailed is
effected, that he be directed to take post either at Fort King, or Paynes
landing, and remain until next winter, and there to be releived, or
ordered down as circumstances may render necessary—send out small
detachments, with directions to go through the settlements on the
Frontier, as often as necessary, to examine and open the Ocklawaha
River from Paynes landing to its mouth so as to enable the command
to get all of their supplies through that channel—Should you feel
disposed to confide these arrangements to my judgement, and dis-
cretion, I will be strictly responsible for the quiet of the Frontier,
and the economy of the expenditures made by the Detachment. I
beg respectfully to submit to your consideration a copy of a com-
munication to Major General Brown, & which grew out of an order
from Major General Brown, confiding the protection of the Frontiers
of Georgia and Florida to my care"—

It is true that many causes of Admiralty & Maritime jurisdiction—

MEMORIAL TO THE PRESIDENT BY INHABITANTS OF
EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:DS*]
[Referred January 11, 1830]
To, ANDREW JACKSON, President of the United States
The memorial of the undersigned most respectfully sheweth, that
they, with many other respectable citizens of the United States have,
with unfeigned regret and disquitude, to deplore the continuance
among them of Joseph L. Smith, the Judge of the Superior Court for
the District of East Florida; as, from his numerous violations of the
law and of justice, he has rendered himself unfit to discharge with
propriety and impartiality the solemn duties of his highly responsible
office. Your Memorialists deprecate the necessity of having recource
to self-defence to protect themselves from his violence and oppression;
and unless the Cheif Magistrate of the United States, to whom they
all look up with confidance and reverence, will not redress their
numerous greivances, they must resort to the “ultima ratio regum' to
protect themselves.
Representations were forwarded to the last Administration repro-
bating the conduct of that individual, both in his private and public
capacity; but strange to say, they were never noticed at least, not
acted upon, consequently affording him fresh opportunities of wreak-
ing his private malice upon all those whom he chose to consider his
* A copy of this memorial submitted to the Senate (NA, SF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.)
by Judge Smith contains the following note: “Of the 10 Signers of the above
complaint—1. Joseph Elzaurdi has given an unqualified retraction disavowing
all cause of complaint—2. B. Segue's name is borne on the memorial of the
County of St Johns, praying for my reappointment. 3. J. A. Coffee's name is
borne on the memorial of Duval County. 4. William Livingston’s name is borne
on the memorial of the County of St Johns. 5. Joseph Delespine's is borne on
the same memorial bearing testimony to the uniform faithful and impartial dis-
charge of my duties, and urging my re-appointment—6. R. D. Fontane disavows
the complaint, and declares it was not signed by him. and so also virtually does
Joseph Delespine, who bears strong and distinct testimony in my favour.
“Of the four remaining signers, Downing, Sanchez Gray & J. M Fontane,
though I do not know that they have disavowed the complaint in writing, yet I
am informed from the most credible sources, that each of them has expressed his
regret that he signed the complaint, that he believed me a capable Judge and that
the interests of the district called for my re-appointment.
“Is it possible that more could be done to invalidate and annul a complaint,
than that those whose signatures are attached to it, should turn round and deny
the complaint, or deny that they had cause of complaint, and that he against
whom it was made is a faithful officer, and aught, for the interests of his District,
to be continued, or join in a strong memorial bearing testimony to his merits,
and praying the President to re-appoint him. Washington 31. Jany 1832

enemies; But many of his former friends are so disgusted with recent
acts of his violence, injustice and partiality as to declare openly, that
they will no longer support a man guilty of such reprehensible be-
haviour; a man whom all desire to look to as an example of all that is
noble, just, and honorable, and not as one using his Judicial power
to accomplish his political projects, but which they have to despise
as the vehicle of private slander and the head which directs it, as a
Bully among the people. All your Memorialists most respectfully
solicit an investigation into his character, and request it at your
hands as the President of the United States bound to protect all good
Citizens of our happy Country, and above all to sustain unsullied
the purity of the Judiciary, as no greater evil can exist in any com-
munity, than a Corrupt Judge.—Your Memorialists, therefore, with-
out further preface, beg leave to lay before you the specifications of
their charges, and will state nothing but what can be proved by in-
disputable evidence. For further information on this subject, we
respectfully refer you to Governor Duval General Call, Colonel
Gadsden, and Major Chairs and Doctor Gibson, residents of this
Territory. Your Memorialists also humbly request your attention
to the Affidavits, already filed in Washington, of Levoritt H. Coe,
James P. Cotter and Samuel Northrup, and to those now inclosed.
It has been stated that the President cannot remove a Judge in a
Territory without an impeachment, and with the approval of the
Senate. If it be so, it is indeed a greivous burden on the People.
When we consider the trouble and difficulty attending a prosecution
of an impeachment, and the accumulating complaints of the people,
it is to be hoped that their interests and liberties will be paramount to
any that may be felt for an Individual, and entitle the foregoing
statement & inclosed Affidavits to evry consideration which their
importance requires”-

THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL TO DELEGATE WHITE
[NA:WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 13]
Jan'y 20" 1830.
HON: Jo" M WHITE. H. Rep"
SIR, I enclose herewith, a letter from the clerk of the District Court
of Florida, covering an extract from the Presentiments of the Grand
Jury of Alachua County,” expressive of the opinion, of the inex-
pediency of bestowing any repairs upon that portion of the road from
Tallahassee to St. Augustine, which lies between Alachua Court
House, and Picolata, on the St. Johns River.
The officer charged with the superintendence of this work has been
engaged upon it now about a month, & there is reason to apprehend,
that the greater part of the money at disposal, for this object, will
have been expended before further instructions could reach him. As
the appropriation was made at your instance, I should be glad to
receive your views on the subject.
You are aware, that the appropriation being specifically for the
repair of the Road from Tallahassee to St Augustine, could not be
applied to any other, as suggested by the enclosed papers, without a
law authorizing it—The work could be suspended until such authority
be obtained, or the whole of the present appropriation might be ap-
plied to the Tallahassee Road lying west of Alachua Court House,
and an appropriation obtained at the present session, for the repair
of the other road from that that place to Jacksonville. The latter
would, perhaps, be the better course, as it would leave more funds
applicable to the western portion of the Tallahassee road, & thus
ensure a more thorough repair than could possibly be effected by the
same means throughout its whole course.

the representation. You will therefore, if you receive these instrue-

the road lying between Alachua Court House and Tallahassee.
It was suggested, in connexion with the above mentioned representa-
tion, to repair the road leading from Alachua Court House to Jackson-
ville, instead of that to Picolati; but the appropriation being specific,
could not be diverted, and it was deemed the better course, to expend
it all upon the road West of Alachua Court House, and endeavor to

tions to the people who have confided their interests to my care. I am
animated neither by personal resentment, nor political opposition.
I have no friends to recommend for the Offices in question and am
indifferent who fills them, if the incumbents are men of good character,
correct habits, and sufficient qualifications.”
The people of Florida necessarily denied any agency in the con-
firmation or rejection, of these appointments, have yet as deep an
interest in them, as those of any part of the union—However in-
capable, or unprepared for self government, the theory of our laws,
and Constitution, may suppose them, yet, they have a right to be well
governed, and the helplesness of their dependent condition, only
authorizes them to look with more confidence, and to speak with
more freedom to the generous protective powers of the Senate—
The inclosed draught of a letter prepared for the Secretary of
State,” will explain the views which I had the honor to suggest for
his consideration—I regret that they brought no conviction to his
judgment, since the pain of making this appeal had otherwise been
spared me. As it is, I have no choice. It is my duty as the Repre-
sentative, and in the name of the people of Florida to remonstrate
against a confirmation of the appointments of James D. Westcott,"
Secretary, and John G. Stower * District Attorney of the Southern
Judicial District—
In the performance of this unpleasant task I shall not stop to
enquire how, or by whom, these Gentlemen were recommended."
The Senate are conversant with the value of recommendations; it is
known with how little regard to merit they are frequently given,
sometimes because refusal is ungracious, often to avoid importunity—
There is a just difference in the object for which they are intended,
as there is in commerce, between the home Market, and exportation—
It is sometimes harder to obtain recommendations for the humblest
office in New York, or New Jersey, than the first in Florida or Arkan-
sas. The Territories are too apt to be considered as the patrimony
of the decayed, or neglected politicians of the States, and the condition
of Society imputed to them as a reproach, is in part to be attributed
to impolitic appointments—The rule however is not without excep-
* A similar letter criticizing B. D. Wright was addressed by White to the
Vice President, Mar. 18, 1830 (NA, SF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.), which enclosed letters
from Lackland M. Stone and Judge Brackenridge that were equally critical of
Wright's ability and accomplishments.

tions. It has not yet been proposed to fill the Government of Michigan,
with cast off agitators from Georgia, or the Carolinas—
In Florida there are at present six Gentlemen holding important
Offices, all of whom are from the non-Slave holding States—It is not
the purpose of my Constituents to draw invidious distinctions, but
they most respectfully beg leave to question the propriety of sub-
jecting a southern population to be governed by persons whose views
and principles are so much at varience with their own. To them it
seems that the danger of disturbing questions now happily at rest,
is increased by appointing to office in Southern Territories, those who
seldom have discretion enough to conceal opinions odious to the
population. Nor can they perceive the propriety of rewarding even
meritorious servants, by so distant a removal from the sphere of their
past utility—No practical injustice they conceive will be done to any
aspirants for Office by confining their ambition to the places most in
unison with their habits, and education. Each quarter of the country
it is believed affords situations numerous enough to gratify all who
come recommended by signal merit, or distinguished talent. But my
Constituents do not rest their opposition to M* Westcott on this
ground only. He came among them thena entirely unknown. They
had not heard of the services by which he obtained his distinction.
His reputation had not preceded him. They knew him but by what
they saw, and on that they formed a judgment decidedly unfavorable.
They have learned that he is a native of New Jersey, and was lately
a clerk in the State Department. Some political or other controversy,
which placed him as he imagined under the neccssity of sending a
challenge, induced him to tender his resignation, inasmuch as he had
heretofore condemned such a violation of the law by an Officer of the
Government. His resignation was accepted, and his place filled. The
quarrel was adjusted, and the people of Florida, ignorant of the
evidence he had given of his fitness for the Office, saw him with some
surprise translated to the Territory as Secretary, in virtue of which
commission he is now Acting as Governor. They believe him without
the talent, experience, or discretion, requisite for such a trust, and
their intercourse with him, far from changing, has only confirmed
that opinion. For myself I can say that since my departure from the
Territory, the appointment has never been mentioned to me without
being condemned, and this without distinction as to local or general
parties. I believe that nine tenths of the people are dissatisfied, and
having learned from the highest authority that offices are created for
their benefit, not for individuals holding them, they cannot persuade
themselves that their wishes when known will be disregarded.
When the duty of scrutinizing the pretensions of persons nominated

imposes on the confirming power the necessity of examining into mens
characters and habits the task of adducing evidence becomes a delicate
and invidious one. It is natural, therefore, that I should prefer plac-
ing the objections of my Constituents whenever it is possible on a
well supported ground of expediency, in accordance with the spirit of
our institutions, and if I am not greatly mistaken, repeatedly recog-
nized by the Senate itself. In all governments the happiness of the
people is, or ought to be the first object of the rulers. It never can
be their true interest to consult the qualification of any individual at
the expense of the wishes of a community—The letter of Governor
Duval " which I have the honor to enclose will satisfy the Senate
that there is great dissatisfaction existing in Florida on this subject.
He concurs in the Statement and opinions expressed in my letter
to the Secretary of State. Florida has been principally settled by
a population, respectable, well educated, and intelligent—They
know that the surest guarantee they can have for the fidelity and
zeal of the public officers is their community of interest and feeling
with the people, and the conciousness that the laws which they
administer, and the policy which they adopt are to bear equally
upon themselves as parts of the system—There are honest and capable
men enough in the Territory to fill all its offices to the satisfaction
of those whose rights and interests are involved in their correct
administration. If any adequate motive of public policy excludes
them from all participation in the official honors and emoluments of the
province, which they have made their home, and in whose prosperity
they have the deepest stake, surely it cannot be necessary to increase
their mortification by placing over them in authority, those whom they
believe to be incapable of useing it either with the kindness of Masters,
or the modesty of Stewarts.
It is incumbent on me also most respectfully to state my objections
to the confirmation of the appointment of John G. Stowers—He is not
only the Attorney for the United States charged with the interests of
Government in the numerous and important questions which arise
under the laws of Nations, and the Revenue, and other acts of the
United States, but he is the prosecutor for all offences against the laws
of the Territory. M. Stowers was appointed last April.” He did not
arrive at key West until December," after the adjournment of the
fall court, and immediately returned to the North. His services are
in constant requisition, yet he has not spent a week at his post for
nine months—Highly respectable professional Gentlemen assure me
that he had not the necessary legal acquirements for such an Office.

He is moreover represented to be a man of idle and loose habits
devoted to gameing and upon one occasion in this City suffered
personal chastisement from one of his own colleagues for an alleged
attempt to cheat at cards. I am aware of the responsibility of such
a charge and am assured by Gentlemen of unquestionable veracity
that if compulsory process be allowed to bring in witnesses the
facts can be proved. When I called at the Department of State to
obtain information relative to the removals and appointments in
Florida, I understood one of the reasons assigned for the selection of
M. Stowers was his being the only applicant. This of course would
be sufficient had the office been then vacant, but as it was at that
time filled by a Gentleman of competant talents and legal learning,
whose commission was not about to expire, applications could hardly
have been anticipated. The absence of competition does not argue
the impossibility of making a better choice. -
These remarks extorted from me by a strong sense of public duty,
are submitted with the most sincere difference to the wisdom and
justice of the Senate."—

SIR, In consequence of extreme indisposition since my arrival in the
city (a few days since) I could not pay my respects in propria persona,
of which I am very anxious as I have heard with infinite surprize and
astonishment that my character has been assailed with the view of
preventing my nomination before the Senate: *—that there would be
an effort made when ever a probable chance of success should offer)
to prevent the confirmation of all the appointments made by the pres-
ent Executive in Florida,—I had expected from the tone of a few
individuals of that Ter” who I understand assumes dictatorial
powers;—but that my private character (which I understand is the
case) should be assailed at this distant period, -and as I must suppose
by persons who are entirely unacquainted with me, -and who prob-
ably never saw me, -has astonish'd me indeed. You Sir, will no
doubt apreciate my surprize properly when I inform you that I have
pass'd through the ordeal of some kind of public employment since
I was 21 years of age up to the present moment without having my
pub. or private character assailed, ühless save only those whose abuse
I esteem preferable to their commendations.
I hope Sir, under existing circumstances, that you will not consider
me obtrusive, or requiring too much in requesting you to confer (if
necessary) with the President, to the end that any nomination that
might be contemplated, should be suspended for a few days 'til I can
venture out, prepared I hope—to refute and repel any and every
charge derogatory to my character. Before closing this communica-

Head Quarters of the Army WASHINGTON Jany 28th 1830.
To THE HON. JOHN H. EATON, Secretary of War.
SIR; The subject of the letter of Mr White of Florida addressed to you
on the 25th inst." and refered by you to the General Head Quarters of
the Army, I have attentively considered. Mr White states that he
has received a presentment of the Grand Jury of Alachua County east
Florida," and various letters, urging the necessity of the establishment
of one or two companies of troops at Cantonement King in East
Florida; or at some point, between the Indian line and the White
settlements, to preserve the latter from the constant depredation of
the Indians on their settlement and property.
There was formerly one company stationed at Fort King: It was
represented to the Government, to be a useless expense to keep the
troops, in that quarter, and the seperation of the Army, into garrisons,
so small as one company, was also found to be attended not only with
great expense; but with injury to the discipline of the Army.
Under these views and considerations the Troops after duly con-
sulting with intelligent officers and individuals on the subject, were

of returning to Key West to adjust his accounts. In the same source are printed
the following: Joseph Anderson, First Comptroller of the Treasury, to the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, Mar. 26, 1830; the official bond of Dean, June 6, 1829; the

of the Treasury to the President of the Senate, Mar. 30, 1830; and a statement of
the revenue received at Key West during 1828–1829. These documents were
also published in the Pensacola Gazette and Fla. Advertiser, Mar. 30, 1880.

The Commanding Officer at Tampa Bay was however instructed
to watch over the interests of the people in Alachua, and to protect
them against any depredations which the Indians might be disposed to
commit.” He was authorized to march detachments of Troops into

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF EAST
FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[January, 1830]
To the Senate & Howse of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled
The undersigned your petitioners humbly beg leave to represent
the great inconvenience they now labor under from the want of a port
of entry somewhere on the River St Johns—
Numerous masters vessels now engaged in the West India trade
direct to this River are subjected to the expence and inconvenience of
a journey from this to S' Augustine for the purpose of entering and
clearing their vessels a distance of forty Miles—
In a Country like this where the mode of conveyance is precarious
and expensive, it is easy to conceive the difficulty merchants residing
here are liable to in chartering vessels for their trade owing to the
over charged freights Masters of vessels will always exact under this
state of affairs. Taking into account the growing importance of this
Section of Florida & the extent & size of the River St Johns, the no
inconsiderable quantity of good lands directly upon its banks, & the
much larger that must shortly present their products to its bosom
as the only channel through which they can pass—Your petitioners
are not aware of any objections that can be raised against this measure
equal to the advantages to be derived from its adoption. If it were
for no other object than to protect the revenue from the pernicious
effects of an extensive smuggling trade the benefits of which go to a
few, and the evils to all, your petitioners think the measure feasible
& almost imperative on the authorities of the Nation. This subject
has for a long time been before Congress and its importance urged
the Legislative Council of 1824 recommended this measure, & the
succeeding Council of 1825 reiterated its importance by an article on
the subject in their general memorial to Congress, an extract of which
follows
“We also strongly recommend the establishment of a Custom House
at Jacksonville on the River S‘Johns; for these reasons, that it will be
a great relief to Ship Masters coming from a foreign port, who are
now compelled to travel from 40 to 50 Miles to enter their vessels, &
because it is a place of considerable enterprize-
Another reason why this point is recommended in preference to
any other is partly the healthy situation of the place, & its commodious
distance from the mouth of the River, & partly because it is the
centre of navigation in East Florida-”
These arguments which had their weight at the time they were

made, & which were unanimously supported by the Legislative
Council, continue to support the measure with superadded import-
ance—All the navigation of importance passes to its destination either
to this place or at some point above or else within 5 miles below—
Jacksonville is situated on the Kings Road from Georgia to S*
Augustine, and is the point thro' which the Northern Mail together
with the Tallahassee Mail passes South into the Territory.—This is
also the place where the United States have two Courts a year, &
where more than half the business of the Court of East Florida is
transacted These and other considerations have induced your peti-
tioners to renew their application. And they most earnestly hope
their prayer may be heard—

[NA:TD, ST Lets. from GLO to ST, Bk. 8 *]
Examined. GENERAL LAND OFFICE 1 Feb. 1830
HON. S. D. INGHAM Sec. of the Treasury
SIR I now return you the note of Mr White" covering a resolution
of the Legislative Council of Florida which was referred by you to
this Office "— A reply to which has been accidentally delayed—
The instructions to Gov Duval to Select the lands appropriated
for colleges in Florida, were given from the Treasury.” His letter
designating the Lands selected" was referred to this Office and
answered, See page N° 1.
I presume the instructions were entirely silent as to the allowance
of any compensation for making the Selections, the law being Silent
on that Subject In authorizing the Governors of the States & Terri-
tories to make these Selections. the Sec of the Treasury no doubt
has been governed by the consideration that the difference in the
value of the Lands Selected at the discretion of the Gov" and of that
which would be selected by himself or any other U States Officer
merely from an inspection of the Surveyors returns would more than
compensate for any expense which the States & Territories would
incur in procuring the Selections to be made by actual inspection
of the Lands. I know of no instance in which the expenses incident
to the expeases Selections made by the Gov' of States & Territories
have been allowed at the Treasury, or of any law under which such
an allowance could be made. A distinction might for these instances
be made in respect to and in favor of Territories, but if so a Special
appropriation should be obtained. The papers are herewith returned

REPORT OF HOUSE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC LANDS

[February 5, 1830]
No. 162. Pre-emption to certain Persons in Florida Made February
5th 1830.
Mr. Isacks, from the Committee on the Public Lands, to which the
subject had been referred, made the following Report:
The Committee on the Public Lands being instructed to inquire
into the expediency of granting the right of pre-emption to those
persons in Florida, whose improvements were sold in 1825, and those
included in the lands ceded to the Indians, and who have been en-
titled to a pre-emption if the sale and cession had not been made
before the passage of the pre-emption law of 1826, report:
That by the act of 22d April, 1826,” the right of pre-emption to a
quarter section of land was given to heads of families, or persons
over the age of 21 years, who, on or before the 1st day of January,
1825, had actually inhabited and cultivated a tract of land in Florida,
and had not removed therefrom; of which settlement, proof was re-
quired to be made to the Register and Receiver of the Land Offices.
But in May, 1825, and before the passage of the pre-emption law, a
part of the Public Lands was sold by the United States; and it ap-
pears by a certificate of the Register and Receiver at Talahassee,
that eight persons had made settlements on the lands, which were
sold, who, under said pre-emption law, had the sale not been made,
would have been entitled to a pre-emption in the land they occupied.
These persons, in the opinion of the Committee, were equally entitled
to the favor of the Government, on account of these early settlements,
with those who did not happen to live on the lands which had been
sold before the privilege of pre-emption was recognized, and as the
best amends which can now be made for the loss of their improve-
ments, and the lands they had selected, they ought to be allowed to
privilege of entering an equal quantity of land, at the Government
price elsewhere.
The testimony on the other branch of the resolution shows that
two persons, namely, Ellis Wood and Mary Dawes, were actually
settlers, and would have been entitled to a pre-emption, but that the
land on which they lived had been reserved to an Indian Chief, by
the Treaty of the 18th of September, 1823.” That, by the act of

2d February, 1827, section 15,” the right of pre-emption, elsewhere,
is given to three persons who had made settlements on lands reserved

bill for that purpose.”

The United States by the Relation of Lewis Gregory vs The Reg-

This case comes before the Court by writ of error to the Judge of
superior Court of the middle District, & the error alledged, is, the
having issued a Mandamus to the Register & Reciever of the western
land District, commanding them to admit to entry, two seperate half
quarters of a section, in the same section, within their District, The
said Gregory having proved himself entitled to the preemption of a
quarter of a section, under the act of Congress of the 26" of April
1826.86
The first question for the Court to consider is, whether the Relator
has a perfect legal right, & for which he has no other specific remedy.
His right to purchase, or his preemption is not disputed, on the con-
trary it is admited. The only question, is, as to his right of making
his selection in distinct half quarters, instead of being compelled to
take it in one entire quarter of a section: & this must depend upon
the provisions of the act of Congress of the sale of the public lands.

Before proceeding to give a construction to the acts, it is proper to
remark, that as the preemption law, intended to confer a benefit, it
should be construed favourably to those entitled to claim under it.
That they should be allowed to apply it, in the manner most advan-
tageous to them, unless the words of the law admit of no doubt, or
unless such construction, should contravene the general pollicy of the
laws relating to the sales of the public lands, or should occasion,
inconvenience, embarrasment or injury to the public interests.
It will be necessary to pass in review the various acts of Congress
on the subject, some of which are to be regarded inpari materia" &
others as parts of the same acts, being made such, by express refer-
ence. The first, but imperfect outline, of our laws relating to the
surveying, & sale of public lands, may be traced to the Ordinance of
1788 land laws 349.” The mode of laying them off in ranges &
townships, & the the subdivisions of townships into sections of a mile
square, was then addopted; but the mode of selling them, afterwards
underwent important changes, the most considerable of which, was
the subdivisions of the sections & the price & the mode of payment.
At this period, townships & sectional townships, were offered for sale
entire, while other were sold in lots of one mile square, which, as has
been observed, was then the smallest subdivision. The sale of entire
townships was discontinued, & there was a still further subdivision
of the section. The range & township lines, became merely the means
of a more perfect & regular division; but for the purpose of sales, the
subdividing lines, whether actually marked, or only ideal, were those
which governed.
The act of the 18" May 1796,” making some important alterations
in the terms of sale, & in laying off the one half each township, into
sections of 640 acres, each. Here is a change of names from lots to
sections, but the thing is the same; that is a distinct portion of ground,
capable of seperate designation or description. The act of the 18"
May 1800," directs a still further subdivision into half sections, &
that of the 26" March 1804 into quarter sections;" the half sections
to be formed by lines running north & south, & the quarter sections
by lines East & West, in the latter case dividing the section into 4
equal parts, each forming a lot or distinct portion of ground. In
these minor subdivisions however, the law provides, that the lines

shall be ascertained at the expense of the purchaser, the sectional
lines only, being surveyed by the Government. It is evident from
the act of the 11" February 1805 (Land laws 515) * that it was in-
tended, that each subdivision, should form a distinct lot, as it is
declared, that the half section, & quarter section, shall be held, &
considered, as containing a certain number of acres, whether the fact
be so or not. The last and smallest subdivision, was required by the
act of the 23"April 1820 (Land Laws 770) * & is that of half quarters
by North & South lines drawn through the quarter sections. The
act of 1805 is refered to & the new lot, or subdivision, is placed on the
same footing with those that had been previously made. From that
time, the public lands for the purpose of sale, have been considered as
consisting of lots containing the Eighth part of a Section, or the half
of a quarter Section. At the public sales, lands were required to be
offered in lots of that discription, but at the private sales, which
succeeded, the purchaser had his option to purchase entire sections,
half sections, quarter sections, or half quarters, provided, he ebserved
he observed the mode addopted, in the in the division of the section
into its subordinate lots; that is, he could not take a half section, by a
line drawn drawn East & West, or a half quarter by a similar line drawn
across the quarter section.
It is now proper to proceed to the examination of so much of the
act of Congress of April 1826 * commonly called the Florida preemp-
tion law, as relates to the subject before the Court.
This act refers to a similar one passed the 5" of February 1813 in
favour of Illinois,” but previously to the subdivision, & sale of public
lands in half quarters, & previously to the alteration in the price &
mode of selling. It is therefore not applicable in its literal extent,
although expressly declared so, perhaps by the oversight or inatten-
tion of Congress, which might have precluded the doubt which has
arisen in this case, by the simple addition of a few sentences. The
act gives to the Florida setler, the right of preemption to a tract of
land under “the same terms & restrictions, conditions, provisions &
regulations in every respect” as are directed by the law of Illinois.
But this must be understood to mean in conformity to the subsequent
alterations in the general plan of the disposal of public lands. Two
very important ones had been made, first, in the subdivisions of the
quarter sections into half quarter sections, in the diminution of the
price & in the denial of credit. If the law was taken literally, the

Florida setler would be required to pay $2 p" acre for his land, but with
a credit & he would not be allowed to purchase less than a quarter
section. This is not contended for, & it is admited that he may pur-
chase in half Guarters. It is contended however, that according to the
following clause in the Illinois law, he is precluded from selecting his
half quarter, in the manner he claims to select in the present case,
although any other purchaser, either at the public sales or afterwards
at private sales might do so if he thought proper; which would be
denying to him the right expressly given him—that of purchasing on
the same terms of other purchasers, at public sale. The words of the
law are as follows, “provided that no more than one quarter section of
land shall be sold to any one individual in virtue of this act, & the same
shall be bounded by the sectional & divisional lines run or to be run,
under the direction of the Surveyor general, for the division of the
public lands.” The Court considers the sectional & divisional lines, at
the time of the passage of the law, to have meant, the lines bounding
the lots of one mile square, the lines drawn from North to South,
dividing these into half sections, & the East & West lines forming
quarter sections. At that time a quarter section could not be pur-
chased by taking one half on one side of any line, & another half on a
difrent side, so as to constitute a quarter section in amount, but this
can now be done in consequence of the present subdivisions. The
object of the provision which has been quoted, was merely to confine
the purchaser to the determinate portions, or lots, into which lands had
been divided for the purpose of sale; that is to say, into sections, half
sections & quarter sections; & is there any, reason, why any purchaser
at the present time, unless expressly restricted, may not purchase a
half quarter, in the same manner, that he could have purchased a
quarter at the passage of the act? It was the policy of the general
government to preserve the general plan by selling in distinct lots,
& it is the only policy which the Court can discover. The clause
which immediately preceeds the one first refered to, is that, which, in
all probability was present to the mind of the person who prepared
the Florida law, “every such person &c shall be entitled to the preference
in becoming the purchaser from the United States of such tract of
land at private sale, at the same price & on the same terms, & condi-
tions in every respect as are or may be provided by law, for the sale
of other lands sold in the said Territory at the time of making such
purchase.”
The purchaser now, at private sale, can take in half quarters, either
adjoining or otherwise, as he may think proper; but the Florida
Setler is restricted by the expressions of the law, which give to him
only the preemption of the tract of land which he has inhabited &

cultivated, & therefore in the opinion of the Court, the half quarter
which he claims to purchase, must be contiguous to such tract of land,
but in what relative position of contiguity does not seem material, so
far as the government is concerned; although to him it may be highly
important.
The Court is therefore of opinion that the setler is not bound to
take his tract in one entire quarter section according to the law of
Illinois, but may take it in seperate half quarters adjoining the tract
which he has inhabited & cultivated, but without regard to sectional
divisional lines excepting so far as they bound the half quarters.
The next question is as to the power of the Court to issue a man-
damus in this case. The Court does not hesitate to say, that where
a legal right is witheld, it ought to be inforced if this be within the
power of the Court. It is admited that where an act is left to the
discretion, that is, either to be done or omitted at the pleasure of
the Agent, or where it is of a deliberative or juditial charactar, or
where the Agent is acting under the immediate orders of a superior,
the mandamus, is not a proper remedy. We do not however see the
force of the reason, that in allowing the remedy, it will be to permit
the government to be sued indirectly, when it cannot be sued directly.
We consider this as a suit of the government against its Agent, or
rather a command to that Agent, to do the will & pleasure of the
government, as announced in its statutes: & this through the organ
created for the purpose of expounding & inforcing them. The
Register & Reciever are the officers immediately directed by law to
do these specific acts, & in relation to these they are not to be consid-
ered as acting under the orders of a superior. -
They are directed by law, to sell at private sale to any applicant,
such of the public lands, as shall have been offered at public sale.
No discretion on Stieh ań such an application is allowed them. It is the
absolute legal right of every one who has resolved to purchase. Can
they be said to act in a judicial or deliberative capasity, in this case,
or under the orders of a superior, or have they discretion to sell or
not to sell, at their pleasure? The Court will admit, that in de-
termining the right of the person claiming the preemption, which
depends on evedence to be produced to them, they are required to
deliberate, but in this case, the right having been ascirtained &
admited, the relator stands on the same footing with other persons,
claiming to to purchase at private sale. If the question of selection
depends upon the law, it is immaterial whether its construction offers
a plain or a difficult case, its meaning must be refered to those whose
province it is to give the legal exposition.

The last question before the court then is, whether the power is
given to the superior courts of the Territory to issue writs of Man-
damus in cases like the present. We think the power is so compre-
hensive as to apply in all cases. The power of Congress to confer
it, cannot be doubted, & it is given without limitation or restriction.
We are therefore of opinion that the writ was properly issued by the
Judge of the Superior Court.

for various reasons, to hold the case under advisement)
The Register and Receiver of the Western Land District v. s. the United
States 96
[No Date]
The Register and Receivers of the Western Land Dist. W. S. the
U. S. by relation of Robinson and Swearingin.
The Relators claim under the Florida preemption law, the right
to purchase, in addition to the quarter on which they are settled, two
adjoining quarter Sections. The question arises under the third
Section of the act of April 1826: this act provides that in case, “where
two, or more persons entitled to the right of pre-emption, on one
quarter, or fractional quarter of a section of land, they shall be au-
thorised to purchase one, or more quarter Sections, which with the
quarter Section, or fractional quarter section, shall be equally divided
between them, in such manner as the Register and Receiver shall
direct, so as to secure as far as may be practicable, to each, such
person, their improvements respectively; provided, that in no in-
stance, shall any person be entitled to a preference, in the purchase,
for more than one quarter Section of land, in addition to the portion
of the fractional quarter of a Section on which he is settled.””
The clause of the law of Illinois,” which declares that no more than
one quarter of a Section shall be sold to any one individual, I consider
inapplicable, because the Florida law presents a case not within the
contemplation of that of Illinois; and it is moreover, admitted, that
under the second Section of Florida law, if the Relators had been
settled on a fractional quarter Section they would be entitled to two
er Haere quarters besides the fractional quarter. The question must
therefore, turn altogether, on the construction of the Florida law.
The intention of Congress, was to secure to the settler his improve-
ments; this I think should not be lost sight of for a moment. The
obscurity in the phraseology of the law, arises from the use of the

word they, instead of each, and the word fractional in the concluding
part of the proviso. Is the latter, to be taken to mean only the legal
fraction (a less quantity than one hundred and sixty acres) in the
surveys? It is no doubt used in this sense in the third, as well as in
the preceding section; but may it not also be used in a different sense
by Congress? The act speaks of two, or more persons settled on a
quarter, or a fractional quarter; it continues to declare that they,
alluding to both, shall be authorised to purchase one, or more quarter
sections upon which such persons shall be settled: which (thus still
preserving the connection with the quarter Section, or fractional
quarter Section) shall be equally divided &c. The mode of division,
which was contended for as an argument against the settlers on an
entire quarter, being each allowed to take an additional quarter,
applies equally to two, or more settlers on a legal fraction. It was
contended, that in the first case the only privilege of the two settlers,
was to choose one adjoining quarter, and that the Register and
Receiver would then divide the half Section between them: but the
directions to those officers to act as umpires, and divider are the same
in both cases. If the word fraction had been omitted in the latter
part of the proviso, it would have been clear; it would then read
thus; provided, that in no instance shall any person be entitled to a
preference in the purchase for more than one quarter Section of land,
in addition to his portion of the quarter Section in which he is settled.
Or, if the expression had been, in addition to his portion of the quarter
Section or of the fractional quarter Section &c.
I can discover no reason why the two settles on what I have called
the legal fractional quarter should have the privilege of purchasing,
each another quarter, which would not apply to those settled on an
entire quarter Section; but which, has been broken into actual
fractions, by their respective improvements. These improvements
are to be secured as far as may be practicable; and in order to do
this, it may be necessary for Register and Reciever to allow to one
settler a much larger portion of the quarter settled on, than to the
other. I think there is therefore either an inaccuracy in the
phraseology of the law, or the word fractional, is equally applicable
to the case of the actual, or accident fraction, as to the legal fraction.
It seem to me, that the object of the law was to give to each settler,
the pre-emption of a quarter Section at all events; but foreseening
difficulties from conflicting settlements in the same quarter, or frac-
tional quarter, it was thought advisable to throw this into the bargain,
under the freindly umpirage the Register and Receiver. The term
divided equally, does not necessarily refer to quantity: they are

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 353
explained by the subsequent expressions “so as to secure to each
person, as far as practicable his improvements.
The impossibility of effecting a division on the principle contended
for, without at the same time, disregarding the respective improve-
ments, is a practical illustration of this view of the subject. Suppose
A and B. settled on different sides of a quarter section; if a quarter be
added on the side of A, how can the land be divided equally so as to
give B, his improvements? It is, true the difficulty may be in some
manner obviated, by allowing each to take an adjoining half quarter,
or by telling them they must agree among themselves; but these are
expedients; they are not constructions of the law, which is supposed
to confer determinate rights.
That it was the intention of Congress to give to each of the settlers
on an entire quarter Section, adjeihing an additional quarter section,
is rendered perfectly satisfactory to my mind, by an exanimation of
the pre-emption law of Missouri, which is a law in pari materia," and
perhaps the law of which, that of Florida, was intended to have been
a literal copy. Perhaps after all, the whole difficulty may have
arisen from the mistake of a copying clerk. The expressions of the
Missouri law, (passed 24 April 1816 land law 701) are therse, “That
in cases where two, or more persons, entitled to the rights of pre-
emption, shall be settled upon one quarter, or fractional quarter
section of land, each person shall be authorised to purchase one, or
more quarters.” The expressions in the law of Florida are precisely
the same, with the exception of the word each, which in the Florida
law, reads they. If the word each were inserted in the Florida law,
the matter would be placed beyond a doubt. But I think the inten-
tion of Congress is sufficiently manifest, to warrant the court in
taking the word they, to mean each, and to give the Relators two
quarter sections in addition to the one on which they are settled,
instead of giving them but one.
I acknowledge that the case presents, on mature reflection, greater
difficulties, than at first occured to me; but in looking to the object
of the law, which was to reward the enterprise of the early settlers,
and the same time to secure to them the fruits of their labor, by allow-
ing them their improvements, I can not entertain a different opinion.
I must here remark, that on the subject of the power to issue the
mandamus, although perfectly satisfied on general principles, yet, in
looking at the decisions of our Courts in the United States, I can
discover a reluctance to assume it in these cases. For my own part,

SIR I have the pleasure to inform you that the land cases in this
district are progressing as rapidly towards a final termination as from
their number and magnitude could reasonably be expected, in the
investigation of these cases I have derived much aid from the compila-
tion of Spanish law &c prepared by Col. White ” which our Court
has decided may be read as authority in favour of as well as against
the United States, this will be found a valuable work in those Countries
where there are many titles to land derived from the Spanish Gover-
ment, the materials of which it is composed are no where else to be
found embodied in the same work & there are many of them which
are no where else to be found in the English language. Col White
suggested to me when he was here on his way to Washington City
that he intended this Winter to add an appendix to this work consist-
ing of all such additional Spanish laws ordinances &c as can be found
and also the decisions of the Supreme Court upon questions arising
under these laws and ordinances and under the Treaty of Cession
such an appendix would add greatly to its value Gen Call who is
now at Cuba will doubtless collect many valuable materials which it
would be for the benefit of the United States to have published in
such a work, & I would suggest the propriety of giving them that
direction unless he should collect enough to form a book of them-

SIR, Your several communications on the subject of the Surveys
binding on the Escambia R. (particularly that of the 26th Ulto. with
explanations,”) leave me conclusively to believe that great error has
been made in those surveys, or that they have not been platted cor-
rectly from the field notes, I have therefore to observe that the in-
congruities in relation to them, must be in some manner reconciled.
The fractional Townships on each side of the Escambia must be laid
down in connection with that River, in conformity to the present
marks & bounds whatever may be their relative position on each side
of the River.—Altho' always desireable yet it is not indispensably
necessary that the Township corners and lines on the East of the
River should correspond with those on the West, but it is essentially
necessary that the surveys should be exhibited on the plats precisely
as they have been executed, on the ground, exhibiting all their dis-
crepancies, if there be any. If the lines have been actually & ac-
curately run, and the Townships platted from the field notes, there
can be no difficulty in doing this, and making a proper connection
of the surveys with the River & with each other, but if the work
upon the ground has been improperly executed, or if the platting has
not been accurately made from correct field notes, then the necessity
of correcting the error, wherever it may be, is evident—
If there should be more land to be sectioned between the two
opposite surveys, they should bear a following number to the high-
est in the Township to which they may be attached. And should
errors be discovered in the surveys already existing they should be
corrected without altering the Sectional numbers as originally marked
& called for, on the ground.—
I beg leave to refer you to my several letters on the subject of
these surveys.

DEAR SIR I had the pleasure of receiving per last mail, your favor
of the 28” Ult° on the subject of donations of land." I thank you
for the information communicated; & will esteem it an additional
favor to be hereafter apprized of the probability of the law passing.
During the past week I have explored the river Waucissa,” from
its source, (3 miles SW of my house) to its confluence with the Ausilla;
& thence to the Gulph. For a distance of four miles before joining
the Ausilla, the Waucissa spreads out into a large swamp; with a
multiplicity of branches of various sizes. Some of these branches
enter the Aussilla above the natural bridges, which obstruct that
river in its passage to the sea—others disappear under the earth-
and only some of the smaller ones keep above the surface, & finally
conduct into tide water. There will be difficulty in obtaining a boat
navigation—nevertheless it may be affected by throwing several of
these branches together, & deepening & widening one of the channels.
The excavations will sometimes be in mud—sometimes in rock—
and the saw & axe will be as much employed, as any other instrument,
to remove logs which seem to have been embedded in the swamp, at
some remote period. I believe however that with an expenditure of
three or four thousand dollars, a good navigation for boats drawing
two feet water, may be be obtained from the Source of the Waucissa
to the Gulph. The distance in a straight line about 20 miles. With
such a navigation, a land carriage of 18 miles would be saved to all
the country north & east of the Waucissa—& to those as far west as

Col° Murat. The Monticello district would be as much benefitted
as any other. At present the settlers as far east as Hickstown trade
to Magnolia; & to these there w” be a saving of land carriage of 18
miles. A town w” grow up at the head of the Waucissa with which
we would all trade.
Will it be practicable to get an appropriation of money to enable us
to effect this desireable object? “Uncle Sam” is also deeply interested
in it. The U. States have much land yet to bring into market in the
fifth Range North of the Base line; & also the country from the head
of the Waucissa to the Gulph. This latter district of country so
immediately interested in this improvement is 18 miles in length;
nowhere less than two miles wide; & for the greater part of the dis-
tance I believe it to be six miles wide. The proposed improvement
w" quadruple the value of this land; much of which is of good quality,
& all of it well timbered.
If an appropriation in money cannot be obtained, would it not be
possible to get a donation in lands? A donation of some five or six
sections of land, with the priviledge of locating them in parcels of a
quarter section, would probably enable us to accomplish the object.
Indeed I am so deeply interested in having the work done immeditealy,
that I would at once undertake it this—werk, myself, for such a remu-
neration. It is all important to those of us who have sugar crops, to
have a water conveyance, instead of land carriage.
I will be happy to hear from you on this subject; & am now looking
for the promised letter communication from “A looker on in Venice”.—
M” G & myself tender our sincere gratulations upon the perfect
restoration of M*W* health. It will afford us the greatest pleasure
to see you both at Waukeenah.

SIR, I have the honor to enclose a communication I have this day
received from James Dell Esq a Member of the Legislative Council
of Florida, and one of our most respectable citizens; residing near
the Seminole reserve:"—and also a copy of a letter I have in conse-
quence addressed to the Creek Agent.” Other representations of
a similar character have been repeatedly made to me during the last
week from gentlemen of the first respectability, and who urge that
upon the score of general policy, (especially as the removal of the Semi-
noles as well as the Creeks and Cherokees beyond the Mississippi is
contemplated, and which the influence of these fugitives will go to pre-
vent if possible,)—as well as upon the ground that the presence of
these “renegadoes” is a cause of annoyance to the white inhabitants, –
some measure should be taken by Government to compel the return of
the stragglers to their own nation, and to prevent if practicable their
migration hither hereafter.
I have also the honor to enclose a copy of a letter received this
day from Col° Humphreys” in reply to my communications to him

[Enclosure: DS]
Memorial to the President by Citizens of the Territory
[February 1, 1830]
To His Excellency Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of
America—
We the undersigned citizens of the County of Leon and Territory
of Florida represent with the greatest respect to your Excellency
that Middle Florida in general is distinguished by a paucity of streams
of running water of a volume and permanency of supply suitable to
mills and other machinary propelled by water. This is eminently
and peculiarly the character of the County in which your petitioners
reside, and the consequence is a great scarcity of lumber. The few
streams of the requisite size and seats for mills, in a County forty
miles in length by thirty in breadth, are with two exceptions found
only within the limits of Forbes purchase, On this purchase and at
points accessible to the citizens of Tallahassee and its vicinity, exist
seats which have been improved for the purpose of supplying, the
necessities of the public They are uniformly surrounded by large
tracts of sterile land, covered with a growth of pine which cannot
be destroyed for ages, and the use of which can in no manner lessen
the value of the land. Your petitioners beg permission, most re-
spectfully to state to your Excellency. that the District Attorney
of the United States, for the District of Middle Florida has obtained
from the Judge of the said District a writ of injunction directed to
certain proprietors of saw mills, in Forbes purchase suspending their
opperrations indefinitely—and forbidding them to use pine timber,
growing on any of the public lands*—Your petitioners believe there
* A copy of the writ issued by Judge Randall was forwarded to Graham by
Ringgold, Feb. 9, 1830 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.). See Graham to Ring-
gold, Mar. 4, 1830 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 1), informing him that the
memorial had been presented by White to the President who believed he had
no power to interfere. Ringgold wrote again to Graham, Feb. 16, 1830 (loc.
cit., Misc. Lets. Recd.), stating that the injunction had been defied and that
he had requested attachments and the appointment of a receiver for the mill.

is no law of the General Government, prohibiting the use of such
timber for purposes solely of domestick application They under-
stand in the neighbouring state of Alabama the practice is universally
tolerated, That no citizen or community, has been denied a similar
accommodation when the object has been confined to domestic
supply and they solemnly declare their belief, that no lumber within
the said County of Leon has ever been sawed for any other purpose,
that none has ever been exported nor was any ever prepared with
that view, To inform your Excellency, that the use of these seats—
and the pine timber in their vicinity are essential to their accommo-
dation and convenience; that they are indispensible to the wants of
this youthful community still struggling with most of the hardships
incident to the first settlement of a new country, will be sufficient
to procure a revocation of the orders under which the District At-
torney has acted. They are willing even to go farther, and pro-
nounce the measure impolitic even if the Government act, with a
view singly to the value of their own property supposing them to
be proprietors of said purchase; for they entertain no doubt, that
these mills add decidedly to the value of the lands included within its
limits, Your petitioners believing that your Excellency is guided by
a liberal and enlighten’d policy—withetit the shaallest stain er time-
ture ef the sinister eehsideratieh ef pelities whieh usually Haingles
se mueh in the measures ef a Perritory—appeal with the greatest
confidence to your generosity, and solicit the interposition of their
respected chief magistrate to grant them the necessary relief.

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE MAYOR AND ALDER-
MEN OF ST. AUGUSTINE
[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[February 23, 1830]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress Assembled.
The Memorial of the Mayor and aldermen of the city of S*Augustine
Respectfully Sheweth,
That there are several lots in this city belonging to the United
States, from which your Memorialists believe the Government derives
no manner of benefit, and for which, they therefore venture to think,
it has no use. These lots have been in the possession of the Military
of this post since the cession of the Country to the United States,
and your Memorialists are not aware that any of them have, since
that event, been used for any public purpose—That they are not so
now, and have not been so for a great length of time past, your
Memorialists are authorized to affirm.
Besides the lots above referred to as being in the possession of the
Military, there is one, called the Old Hospital lot, which has been
for several years past, and is now, under the directions of the Gov-
ernment, in the possession and use of the Corporation of this city.
From it a small annual revenue of about sixty dollars is derived by
the city.
The Old Hospital and Smith's lots are the only ones which can be
considered as having improvements of any value on them. They
have each a building on them, but in a state of great dilapidation from
the want of necessary repairs. They are consequently of little value
and in a course of rapid deterioration. The greater number of lots
belonging to the Government stand in conspicuous parts of the City,
and from their neglected, ruinous, and unimproved condition, affect
very prejudicially its appearance and well being.
Your Memorialists influenced by these considerations, and the
great need which this city stands in of the bounty of the Government,
earnestly pray your Honorable Bodies to be pleased to grant these
lots (which are particularly described in a schedule hereto subjoined)
to the Corporation of this City. There are many Objects in and
about this city demanding, and well worthy of, improvement; but
which from its very limited resources are wholly beyond attainment.
The donation which Your Memorialists humbly presume to re-
quest at your hands would go far towards enabling the city to ac-
complish them, and would in many other respects be of great im-
portance and benefit to it.—
Relying on the munificence of your Honorable Bodies for a favor-

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF THE TERRI-
TORY
[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred March 2, 1830]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the undersigned, Citizens of the Territory of
Florida, Humbly Represent,
That the Government of the United States have at all times con-
sidered it important to protect every branch of the public expenditure
with a view to economy and particularly in the Management of the
mail department, to observe the means by which the great ends of
the Common good may be protected is all important to the prosperity
of the Country. Your memorialists in making this appeal to your
Honorable body believe they will not be charged with too great bias,
influenced by individual interest or feeling, but on the contrary, the
prominent and leading features of this Memorial will tend to promote
the Commercial interests at large, independent of any immediate
local advantages to your memorialists.
Your memorialists would therefore most respectfully represent,
that under the present Mail arrangement to Tallahassee the Seat of
Government, your Memorialists are only entitled to a mail a week
arriving at the latter place every Monday. This Mail is transported
from Augusta to Tallahassee via Milledgeville and Hartford in the
County of Pulaski, Georgia: and, your Memorialists believe there
can be no good reason assigned why the mail should not come direct
from Augusta to Tallahassee, when it can be transported from the
latter place saving a distance of seventy five miles. Your memorial-
ists further represent, that looking to the actual difference in the
distance and at the same time to the superiority of one route over
the other, they humbly apprehend, it is equivalent to One hundred
miles in favour of the route direct from Augusta: And your memor-
ialists further represent that there are only two post offices between
Milledgeville and Hartford, at which point the mail strikes the direct
route from Augusta to Tallahassee, passing over a broken and hilly
country, presenting many formidable obstacles as a carriage highway,
such as bad roads and Water Courses, all of which are encountered


## p. 370 (#386) ############################################

370 T E R R ITO RIA L PA P E R S
merely to meet the Convenience of the community between Milledge-
ville and Hartford which could be effectuated by a Horse mail from
the former to the latter place.
Your memorialists further represent that under the present mail
arrangement they labor under the most serious difficulties. From
their geographical situation, they are cut off from the best and easiest
communications through which to extend their Commercial relations,
and they humbly hope that the Mail route may be changed so as to
meet the interests and convenience of your Memorialists, and further
pray that the mail may be transported twice a week direct from
Augusta which will tend to extend to this Community a more direct
and safe intercourse with their neighbors.—
And your Memorialists further represent, having an eye to the
Commercial importance of Havanna immediately in our neighbor-
hood, the Government of the United States must be alive to the
growing and existing relations between that great Commercial depot
and the Cities of every part of our Union. Your memorialists gen-
erally indulge in the hope, and humbly suggest that the establish-
ment of a direct mail route from Augusta to S' Marks, Middle Florida,
and from thence to Havanna via Key West” would not only tend
to facilitate Commercial intercourse, but go far to aid and strengthen
the revenue of this government. Your memorialists do not entertain
a doubt when the mail route from Augusta to S' Marks direct comes
to be enquired into by the proper Department, it will be found that
the mail can be transported to Tallahassee in four days, which would
make ten days from the seat of our Federal Government, whereas
by the present arrangement, fifteen days are consumed.
And your Memorialists further represent, and it is the opinion of
persons intimately acquainted with the navigation of the Gulf of
Mexico and its tributary Waters, that three Mail boats fitted up for
passengers, to ply between S. Marks and Havanna via Key West
would meet the most decided encouragement and not cost the Gov-
ernment more than ten thousand dollars per annum, which sum your
Memorialists verily believe would be covered by postage receipts in
behalf of the Mail revenue. By the present Contract, your Memor-
ialists learn, that the annual sum of Twenty five hundred dollars or
more is paid over and above the receipts of the Post office Depart-
ment. Your memorialists further represent there can be no doubt
but that the Spanish authorities would readily enter into an arrange-
ment so reciprocal and so highly advantageous to the merchants of
their own provinces and calculated to produce that mercantile inter-
course and interchange so highly beneficial to trade; and indeed as
* See ante, p. 306.

your Memorialists are informed that at this day the Spanish authori-
ties permit the mail packets of other nations to enter the Port of
Havanna free of charges.—
Your memorialists further represent, that the Island of Key West
is assuming an important attitude, & whether viewed in the light of
a Commercial, military or naval depot, it must ere long be considered
as the key to the Gulf of Mexico so far forth at least as the American
trade is concerned. Your memorialists would respectfully suggest
from the growing consequence of Key West it concerns the govern-
ment and deeply interests your Memorialists in having a certain and
permanent communication with that place, and amongst other
reasons your Memorialists would suggest at this time, that altho’
Key West is protected by the Judicial and Executive arms of the
Federal & Territorial Governments it cannot be approached with
any degree of certainty, but all is left to hazard and doubt. In
tender Consideration whereof, and for the reasons set forth by your
Memorialists, they humbly pray that this their Memorial may
receive the mature Consideration of your Honorable body.” &° &”

[NA:SF, 21 Cong. 1 sess.:DS *]
[March 13, 1830]
To The Honorable, the Senate, and House of Representatives of the
United States, in Congress, assembled.
The Memorial of the Subscribers, Inhabitants, of Musquito County
in the Territory of East Florida, and Masters of Wessels, and others,
now in the Harbour of New Smyrna in said district, Respectfully
Sheweth, that we are suffering considerable privations, and difficulties,
in the trade to this quarter in consequence of there being no Light
House at Musquito Inlet, or Buoys on the bar; that Since the Ter-
ritory came into possession of the United States, the intercourse and
trade of this immediate district, has rapidly encreased, and from the
zeal manifested in taking up lands for the culture of Sugar it may
fairly be presumed, that a Vast business will ere long be carried on
in that article, in addition to which large Quantities of Live Oak
timber, so essential in the construction of our Navy, grow in this
Section of the Territory all of which must pass over Musquito Bar,
we would here further state that during the last fifteen months
about Thirty sail of Vessels (principally Brigs, and large Schooners)
have passed over this bar, and that at this time there are seven sail
of Wessels in this Harbour, ready for Sea; We therefore respectfully
request your honorable body to pass a law for the erection of a Light
House, on South side of Musquito Inlet, and placing Buoys on the
Bar, and your memorialists as in duty bound will ever &c

To HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Govt of Florida & Sup'

SIR, I am directed, by the Secretary of War, to communicate
to you that the President has, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate appointed John Phagan of North Carolina Indian agent
to the Florida Indians.” You will notify him of said appointment;
and require of him to submit his bond which will be in the sum of
12,000$, for the approval of the Department. On that approval
being announced to you, you will give him his instructions. He
will be referr'd to you for them.
At the same time the Secretary of War requests that you inform
Col° Humphreys that he is superseded; and that his agency will
terminate on the receipt of your letter conveying to them the
information."—
I have &c, &c,
THO" L. MeKENNEY.
* Nominated Mar. 12, 1830, and confirmed, Mar. 17 (Senate, Exec. Journal, IV,
68, 72). Phagan's bond was received in May and his commission was transmitted
in June (McKenney to DuVal, May 27, and June 10, 1830, NA, OIA Lets. Sent,
Bk. 6). This appointment left a vacant subagency on the Apalachicola river.
See DuVal to the Secretary of War, Aug. 17, 1830 (loc. cit., Lets. Recd., Fla.),
enclosing a petition dated Aug. 1, 1830, from John Blunt and other Florida chiefs
to the President and the Secretary of War.
* Acknowledged July 13, 1830 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.). Humphreys,
who was thus displaced, petitioned the House of Representatives in 1831 (House
Journal, Dec. 12, 1831, 22 Cong., 1 sess., p. 33; petition not found), for indemnifi-
cation for losses sustained as a result of having to surrender his lands and improve-
ments to the Seminole. The House Committee on Private Land Claims did not
consider him entitled to compensation, since there was a difference of opinion
as to the cost of clearing land and the buildings had been built at government
expense without his informing his superiors that they were placed on his land
(NA, HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.). Pursuant to a Senate resolution of Jan. 14, 1835
(Senate Journal, 23 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 92–93), the Indian agent, Wiley Thompson,
was instructed on Mar. 21, 1835 (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 15), to investigate
Humphreys’ claim. Thompson's report, with supporting documents, submitted
July 9, 1835 (loc. cit., Lets. Recd., Seminole), showed that the tract of land pur-
chased by Humphreys from Antonio Alvarez was at a different location than the
Indian agency and that the buildings there had been constructed at government
expense. Therefore there was no basis for the claim.

[NA:SD, Fla. Archives: ALS]
TALLAHASSEE Mar. 28. 1830.
SIR In my last " I promised to furnish a more full report of my
proceedings as Special Agent of the United States in the Island of
Cuba, which I have now the honour to submit.
Finding it impossible to proceed to Havanna until after the com-
mencement of the Sickly Season of the last year, with the permission
of the President my visit was postponed until Subsequent to that
period. I left home on the 22" of December and arrived at Havanna
on the 5th January last. On the 6th. I addressed an Official note to
the Captain General informing him of my arrival and requesting an
interview with him.” On the 7th I was verbally informed through the
American Consul M Shaler, that the Cap. General would see me on
the 9th. of January. Deeming this mode of communication unusual
and disrespectful, I declined the interview and addressed him an
other note accompanied with your letter, which I was charged to
deliver to him. An answer to my Second note was given, and soon
after a reply to your letter which is herewith enclosed was sent to
me. Thus situated I did not call on the Cap. General, until I had
been waited on by his public interpreter, and furnished with a full
Explanation, and apology, for the manner in which I had been re-
ceived. I then accepted an invitation to wait on him, and after pre-
senting my commission from the President of the United States, I
demanded such original documents relating to the land claims in
* Other applicants had offered themselves for the position (NA, SD, Applica-

as references Postmaster General W. T. Barry, Secretary of War J. H. Eaton,
and Major William B. Lewis. Byrd C. Willis, of Tallahassee, was recommended
by Del. White to the Secretary of State, Mar. 4, 1830.

return from Havana and containing a brief summary of results.

Florida as might exist in the Archives of Havanna. To this he re-
plied that he had he pewer te deliver them withetit the speejal eréler
ef the King but he premised te fürnish me with Cepies ef stieh as +
Paight designate; all the papers belonging to the Archives of Florida had
been delivered at the surrender of the Country, and that there were
none remaining within his government. On being assured to the con-
trary he observed that he was the mere military Commander of the
Island, and had no power to deliver the original papers without the
orders of his government, but that he would with great pleasure fur-
nish me with copies of such as I might designate, I then addressed him
a letter a Copy of which N° 1 is herewith enclosed, to this I received
for answer that he had given the necessary orders to the different de-
partments of his government to furnish the copies required. After
the procrastination and delay common to those people, the Original
title papers in the care of Aradondeau " & Son, John Forbes & Co
west of the Appalachicola Panton Leslie & C° and John Forbes &
C° and John Forbes individually were produced. When the Copies
were nearly completed I had an opportunity of seeing the originals,
which I found to vary so materially from the Copies on which the
claimants has founded their actions, I considered their production at
the trial indispensably necessary for the defence of the United States.
And I determined notwithstanding the former refusal of the Cap.
General to renew my demand of the original. This I did in a letter
of 16th. feby. a copy of which N° 2 is herewith enclosed" and after
much difficulty and delay succeeded in attaining them.
The original deed from the Indians to John Forbes & Co." Convey-
ing the land on which fort S" Marks is situated, and which was then
garrisoned by the troops of Spain, is signed by twelve obscure indi-
viduals, most of whom resided within the limits of the Creek nation
north of the 31st degree of latitude. The Consideration for which
the sale was made is still blank in the Original, though the Copy filed
by the claimants is filled up with the sum of $19,387.4% Reals. The
deed to Panton Leslie & Co is more formal, but is liable to the following
objections it was made subsequent to the death of Panton and Leslie.
It purports to have been made by the Seminole Indians in considera-
tion of the debts due by them to the said house, But the list of debtors
as well as those who signed the deed there shew that they belonged
to the Indian towns within the limits of the United States, the con-
firmation by Governor Folch” of both these claims covering near

two million of acres of land is evidently spurious. But even if it was
genuine, I have obtained the most conclusive proof of the total want
of power in Gov. Folch to confirm those grants. The second grant
to John Forbes & C° is estimated to contain one and a half million of
acres, but from the boundaries Extending from the Appalachicola to
the River Choctawhatchee and presenting a part front on the Sea
Coast of more than a hundred miles it must contain nearly double that
quantity. It purports to have been granted by the Cap" General of
Cuba in consideration of losses said to have been sustained by the
said house. This grant bears upon its face the most conclusive evi-
dence of its fraudulent character. The original dates have been
erased and others inserted, in order to bring it within provisions of the
8th, Article of the treaty which renders good all grants made subse-
quent to the 24th. day of Jany. 1818. The grant to John Forbes
individually is for an Island in the River Appalachicola said to contain
7,000 acres. This depends alone on a deed of gift from a few of the
Indians most of whom lived north of the 31st. degree of latitude, and
never was formally confirmed Felek by Governor Folch or any other
authority of the Spanish Government.
The grant to Arredondo and Son for 24 miles square genuine, but
was made on Conditions that the grantees should settle on the land
two hundred Spanish families, the settlements to be commenced within
three years from the date of the grant. These conditions have never
been Complied with, and the grant must be considered valid. I
obtained Copies of several other documents, relative to the power of
the officers of Spain to make grants of land in Florida This was
accomplished by employing the keepers of the Archives to search for
them privately, and after I had paid for and obtained the Copies, I
procured the authentication of the Cap. General, in every instance
where I asked for documents, without having first seen them, I was
informed by the Cap. General that they could not be found.
His reluctance to afford any facility to the United States in the
investigation of these matters was evinced on all occasions, but in the
instance in which I asked for a copy of a letter from Gov. Zespedez."
of East Florida to Gov. Oneill” of West Florida, his unwillingness was
more particularly manifested. A copy of this letter with the Certifi-
cate of the Cap. General Annexed, had been filed by the claimants
in the Case of John Forbes & Co from its phraseology I believed it to
be spurious, and I asked for a copy with a view of detecting a fraud,
but I was informed by the Cap. General that no such letter could be
found in the Archives. The lands granted to Forbes & Co is situated

What it was made by Gov. Folch of West Florida. The letter above
Whentioned states that the jurisdiction of West Florida had been
\xtended from the Appalachicola to St. Marks river, which would

Convinced that the Copy filed by the claimants is faithless, and I
Welieve the Cap. General was unwilling to Expose the fraud. To his
note N° 3.” informing me that this letter could not be found I ad-
dressed him another letter a Copy which is herewith Enclosed N° 4"
To this he replied N° 5" that he had ordered the search for this
document to be renewed and if found a Copy should be sent to me.
See a Gepy ef this letter N° 4.
There was another instance in which his prejudices in behalf of the
claimants was clearly exhibited. A Commission had been sent out
to Examine witnesses in the Island of Cuba. It appears to be a reg-
ulation of that government that no public officer can be examined as
a witness in any case without first obtaining the permission of his
immediate Chief. I had been present when one of the claimants ap-
plied to the Cap. General for permission to Examine three witnesses
which was granted without a moments delay. Some time after I ad-
dressed him a note a Copy of which N° 6" is Enclosed asking per-
mission to Examine an individual in behalf of the United States.
This application was referred to the Kings Attorney for an opinion,
who stated in reply that I could only Examine the witness before the
Cap. General, which he communicated in a letter of 4th March, a
Copy of which N° 7. is also Enclosed,” to this I addressed him a let-
ter of which N° 8* is a copy and which closed my correspondence
with him.
I feel confident that I have procured every thing necessary for the
defence of the United States in the cases above mentioned But there
are many documents belonging to the Archives of Florida, still re-
maining in the different departments of the Government at Havanna
which may be of great importance to the government as well as our
citizens. They were ceeded to the United States with the territory
of Florida, and ought to be placed in our possession, I would there-
fore respectfully Suggest the propriety of instructing our Minister

have replied that all the documents and Archives were delivered when
Florida was Surrendered to the United States, But this statement is
incorrect for I have Seen and Examined privately a number of those
documents and with the knowledge I now possess of their situation I
feel well convinced that I could with the proper authority easily pro-
cure them, and I would willingly undertake it, if this measure should
be adopted. I found the Cap. General extremely unwilling to enter
into a correspondence with me, and in no instance did he ever reply
to one of my letters without first consulting the other authorities of
the Island as you will perceive from his answers. This reluctance I
understand was created by the publication of his correspondence with

government.

THOMAS L. MCKENNEY TO GOVERNOR DUVAL
[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 6]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs, 13" April, 1830.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY William P. Duval, Tallahassee, Florida.
Sir, The President and Secretary of War are both anxious to promote
the welfare of the Indians by every means in their power. They
believe amongst the best means of accomplishing this is to educate,
and improve their children. This course has been pursued with the
Choctaws and Creeks and Chickasaws and Potawatimies and others
with great effect. Children of all these and other tribes have been
put to school and educated, and learned to speak our language, and
then on their return have been able to transact business for their
tribes, and confer great benefits upon them.
By the treaty with the Florida Indians of 18* September 1823, a
provision was made for the purposes of education," and to carry it into
effect, Congress appropriated the sum of one thousand Dollars a year,
for the term of twenty years;"no part of it appears to have been drawn,
except the allowance for 1825," and that was not used for the purpose
intended, and for which it was sent. It is believed the Florida
Indians could by your influence be induced to second the wishes of
* No transmittal letter has been found.
* Believing that Exum would retain his more lucrative job as deputy surveyor,

recommending the former governor of Georgia, John Clark, as permanent marshal.

* The act approved May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 38), appropriated $2,000 for the
support of a gunsmith and for education to be paid on an annual basis for twenty
years.

the President in the education of their children, especially as it will
cost them nothing. They would give great pleasure to the President
and Secretary of War, if they would, as it would evince their wisdom,
and shew that they were anxious to promote the welfare and happiness
of their children. I write therefore by direction of the Secretary of
War to get you to explain fully to the Florida Indians this important
subject that the amount now due under the provision of the Treaty,
as well as that which will become due, may be employed, under the
direction of the President for the object for which it was provided.
You will know how to introduce this subject, and convince them of
its importance— For after all, the greatest benefits which we can
bestow on the Indians, is to enlighten and improve their Children,
and Qualify them to be of use to themselves and their tribes. This is
considered a very important object, and as such your particular atten-
tion is called to it. Much can be done by you in effecting this humane
object; and much is looked for to be done. I am aware of the preju-
dices of these people, and how hard it is to fix their attention upon such
an object—but by patient instruction and counsel, much can be
effected.
It would be very useful to have all these tribes represented at one
common school. They would form friendships, and go home, and be
able to allay much of the excitement which a want of better acquaint-
ance occasions; and mutually benefit each other's tribes &c. &c.
The President would no doubt prefer to have these children sent
to the school in Kentucky, called the Choctaw Academy, and which is
located at the Blue Springs in Kentucky, the residence of Col° R. M.
Johnson. This school is under the particular regulations of the
President of the United States, and if children are there, they will
be under his most immediate care.
If the Indians shall consent to send their children eight boys between
the ages of 10 & 14 may be sent, and sent immediately. Their
expenses and the expenses of the person who may take them to Ken-
tucky will be paid by your bill on the Department of War—Where it
is possible, to get them, vouchers will be expected for their expenses.
The number viz: 8 will be kept up for 5 years, after which period,
the number will be reduced to 4—and so continued for 8 years until
the annuity will expire in 1843.”
Very respectfully &c.

RICHARD C. ALLEN TO GEORGE GRAHAM
[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.:ALS]
Tallahassee FLORIDA 13" April 1830
GEORGE GRAHAM Esq Commiss" of the Gen' Land Office
SIR, I feel it my duty to Communicate to you, that in the large
grant made to John Forbes & Co. West of the Appalachacola & East
of the Choctawhatchy Rivers,” now claimed by John & James In-
nerarity, and now pending in the Superior Court for the Western
District, under the Act of 23* May 1828.” We have detected, by
means of an original document, brought from Havanna by Gen' R. K.
Call, the grossest attempt, to impose upon the government by fraud
and forgery, that has ever been develloped in this Country. Erasures,
and alterations of dates, are so palpable, that is only necessary to
see an examine the document, to be convinced that it is base attempt
to bring the grant within the provissions of the Treaty, by antedating
it, & by other alterations equally palpable and material.-
The document in question is the original petition of John Forbes
to the Captain Gen' soliciting the lands, his (the Cap" Genls) order
referring it, to the Surveyor Gen' and to the Kings attorney, and their
Seperate reports thereon, and finally the grants, in the usual form;
Signed by the Captain Gen". All that part of the petition of Forbes,
which refers to and speaks of the boundary of the lands he Solicits,
as well as that part of the grant which refers to the same matter,
has been taken out, and other Sheets introduced, as is evidenced by
the difference in the ink, the hand writing, the Stamp of the paper,
the mis Spelling of John Forbes name (which is throughout spelled
John Farbes), beside many other marks apparent upon upon in-
spection which leave no doubt upon my mind, but that it is Spurious.
The claimants brought suit upon a copy, properly certified, which
is entirely fair upon its face, alledgeing that the original belonged to
the Archives at Havanna, and that they could not obtain it, that the
U. States Should obtain it if it was desired, that the Government
could demand it from the Spanish Gov" as a document belonging to
Florida, which they as individuals would have no right to do, &c.
This grant is supposed contain near 1,500000 acres, including a great
extent of Sea Coast, and some of the finest Bays & harbors on the
Florida Coast, with many thousand acres of verry fine lands, which
probable but for the accidental discovery of this document would
have been lost to the U. States.
The object of this communication is to suggest that the original

record (expediente) should be in all cases produced by the claimants
and filed.—I feel convinced, that in most cases where copies only
have been produced, that the original would detect fraud either in
the quantity, the location, or something else equally important for
the interest of the Gov". All the papers relating to grants of lands in
Florida belong to the U. States and she has a right to demand them
of Spain. Individuals have not this right, and therefore they offer
certified copies, & require the Gov' to obtain the originals, as she alone
has the right to demand them. I would therefore suggest the pro-
priety of a Special Mission to Havanna, with authority to demand all
papers of whatever discription, which properly belong to the Archives
of Florida, under the treaty of 22" Feb 1819, and that in the mean
time, the trial of all cases now pending under the Act of 23" May 1828,”
in Florida, where the originals have not been produced, be suspended
until they are produced, or until the return of the Agent sent out for
the purpose aforesaid. I make this Sugestion under a thorough
conviction that the interest of the U. States would be materially
subserved by the production of the original papers in several of the
cases now pending in Florida. I would be pleased to hear from you
as early as convenient upon the subject of this communication.”

DEAR SIR—I learn with pleasure that an appropriation of two

road from the commencement, it being a favorite object with me to
see a mode of passing from New Orleans to the North, without being
obliged to go round the peninsula of Florida by sea, or to go high up
through Alabama, through a hilly, or rather broken country, and
unhealthy. It is a singular fact, that on the line of this road from
Mobile to Pensacola, and thence to Tallahassee, the country is remark-

completed. Since I had the pleasure of seeing you, the two appropria-
tions, that for a road from this place to Mobile, and from this to
Alaqua, have been expended. I have not travelled the road to Mobile,
on which a stage now runs once a week, but it is spoken of in very
high terms by those with whom I have conversed, and it is said to be
equal to any northern turnpike. I have no hesitation in saying that
a stage might run in a day and part of a night to Pascagoula, and tak-
ing the steam boat, passengers might go thence to New Orleans in
twelve hours. I have travelled the road to Alaqua, and I can assure
you it is well executed—it will require little or no repair for twenty
years: the causays, will last forever, and the bridges are constructed
of light wood, that is of yellow pines, which have been dead perhaps
for fifty years, have dropped all their sap, and having been scorched
by fires when they stood, when cut down, they are composed entirely
of resin, and possess a specific gravity greater than water: in fact the
wood sinks like iron or lead. This wood is almost imperishable.
There is now twenty five miles of fine stage road, which may
with ease be travelled in a day. The only defects are, that the stumps
on the old military road are cut too lew high, and one of the fords is
too steep for carriages, that of Clear creek. There is still one stream,
that of little Alaqua, which wants a bridge, it will be a weeks work for
five hands. The instructions which were given by you, in relation
to the materials of the bridges, have had a most excellent effect, and
I have no doubt that in future, all the military roads will be constructed
in the same way. I am deeply impressed with the importance of this
road. The mere transportation of troops is not the only military use;
eehsiderable the transportation of the mail, and the certain and rapid
communication of intelligence from the Seat of government to the
extreme Southern frontier, are of the highest importance in time of war.
I speak with perfect confidence when, I say, that it is practicable, to
form a communication by this route, which will enable the govent to
transmit intelligence to New Orleans, regularly in twelve days.
Capt. Burch before leaving this place put into my hands the sum
of 1403 to be expended in completing the road to Alaqua. I have
just returned from that place, having eempletd—the built a bridge
over the Alaqua of three Arches, and one over Jones' Creek, the first
is seventy five feet in length, the other forty. The timber is of the
very best kind-superior I believe to any on the road. In fact, I have

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 399
taken unusual pains. The Alaqua is the principal stream between
Pensacola, and Chactahatchy. Besides making the bridges, I have
made fords across two streams on this side of Rock Creek, where
Capt: Burch left off, but one of them, (Little Alaqua) requires a
bridge; having already expended forty or fifty dollars etight out of
my own pocket, in addition to the sum left with me, besides giving
my personal attention, it would not be reasonable to expect me to do
the work. I have cut about two miles of road through thick ham-
mocks, among large trees of every kind, which is very different from
cutting in the open pine woods, where there may not be tree to cut in
two hundred yards. I have employed persons to cut about an equal
number of miles in the pine woods.
When I admit that the road was well made by Cap. Burch, I must
also state the truth, although not for the purpose of complaining of
him, and I do not wish anything I may say will to be regarded in that
light, Capt. Burch never saw the road but once, which may be excus-
able on account of his having other duties to perform: but he had
favorites and relations to serve. The compensation allowed the
Superintendant, if I am correctly informed was eleven dollars a day—
five for his personal services, and six for his cart and horses, which
were provided with provender at Publick expense. I am also told
that the negroes of his father in law M* Bellamy were paid from fifteen
to seventeen dollars a month, and were found in provisions from Pen-
sacola, when they might have been obtained cheaper in the country.
Fifteen dollars and found, is the usual wages at the publick works,
and in this neighborhood, because there are many reasons why owners
of slaves do not like to employ them on the publick works, one of
them is the habits which they are apt to acquire—and free white
laborers are very unwilling to be employed then among slaves. But
this is not the case in the interior, when the slaves are employed near
their homes, and not usually separated from their families. Laborers
enough can be had at fifteen dollars and find themselves. I have had
no difficulty in doing so, and can procure any number that may be
wanted. I have found it more advantageous and economical to make
specific contracts where I could: for instance, the frame of the bridges
of Alaqua was furnished for forty dollars, that of Jones' Creek for
twenty five, and the hauling cost about twelve, at 175cts per day for
oxen and driver. Besides it is worthy the consideration of the govern-
ment, that by the distribution of small sums in this way among
worthy and industrious people, much good is done to them and to
the country at large. I am therefore not satisfied with the manner
in which the money has been expended by Capt Burch. I could have
done all the work he has done for half the amount. The present

Quarter Master, Cap. Shannon,” I believe is a different kind of man—
he has no individual views or friends to serve. Although but slightly
acquainted with him, I am confident he will have a single eye to his
duty.
I am aware that there is a delicacy in permitting any interference
with the duties of an Officer, who is responsible to his superior for the
faithful discharge of them. Yet, if it can be done without infringing
upon this rule of propriety, I should like much to have something to
say in the making of this important link of the road from Alaqua to
Mariana. I have traversed the country so often, and have thought
so much on the subject, that I can be of use to Capt" Shannon, in
assisting to select the ground for the road, and would cheerfully lend
my personal assistance in exploring it. Capt. Shannon cannot be
so intimately acquainted with the Country. The selection of the
ground from Alaqua to Hard Labour, a distance of forty five miles,
is of great importance and is very difficult—and on the proper selection
of this part of the road, will almost depend the value of the read rest.
The Chactahatchy, has the worst swamp of any river in America, it
is the great obstacle to the whole road—yet I think it may be over-
come—it is low, wide, and cut up with deep slues. I presume Capt"
Shannon would not feel himself treated with disrespect, if it were
intimated to him, to avail himself of my assistance, voluntarily
tendered by me, in selecting the route, at least the crossing place of
the Chactahatchy"—

[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
April 28, 1830
To the Honorable the senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled.
The Petition of the undersigned inhabitants of St Augustine re-
spectfully represents. That they are desirous of establishing in that
City a High School for the education of children of both Sexes in the
higher branches of Literature Antient and modern languages &c.
That in order to effect this object, they find it necessary to ask assist-
ance of General Government in supplying a lot of ground &c. The
lot formerly occupied by the Spanish Goverment for a collectors
office lies vacant, except the old walls which are a nuisance to the
City, and wholey useless to the Goverment.
They respectfully pray that Congress will Consider that the East-
ern District of Florida is so much covered with spanish grants that
little if any land remains for the use of schools. That these have not
been surveyed and from their inferior quality, may never, or at least
not for a long time here, be surveyed. The old inhabitants, and the
native americans, are different in manners customs and language and
never can be cordially united untill the youth of all all denominations
shall be educated together. Our City can never become a place of
extensive commerce. But the salubrity of the Climate and beauty
of situation, have already rendered it a favorite resort for emigrants
and invalids from various parts of the United States. To them it
would be particularly desirable to educate ther children where they
chose to reside.
For these and various other reason they pray your honorable body
to grant to them the Lot of ground above described, and they will

Sir, In reply to the Resolution of the Senate of the U.S. bearing
date the 26th Ulto in the words following to wit:—
“Resolved.—That the Secretary of the Treasury be requested to
inform the Senate, whether any of the Land lately sold in Florida,
was returned on the Survey as Swamp Land; and whether any of the
same has been since ascertained not to be so: and whether the Surveyor
General or any of his deputies, or other Land Officers, became the
purchaser of any Land so returned as Swamp Land and was not so’”
which you have referred to this Office, I have the honor to report that
some of the public Lands offered for sale at Tallahassee in February
last, have been reported in the Surveys as Swamp land; this Office
however possesses no evidence that any of the Land thus reported
was not Swamp Land.—
The Statement, marked A. shows that at the Sale alluded to there
were two tracts of Land bid off, one by a Deputy Surveyor, & the
other by a Clerk in the Office of the Surveyor General which tracts
appear from the surveys to be low wet, and marshy.—but the Office
possesses no evidence that the Land is not as is represented.
At the public Sale alluded to, it does not appear that the Surveyor
Gen' made any purchases nor does it appear that the Officers of the
Land Office bid off any Lands that the Surveys indicate to be Swamp
Land.

WILLIAM WIRT. Esq." Baltimore Md
SIR. I enclose for y' information and also for your advice a copy
of a letter from R. C. Allen Esqr law Agent for Florida,” I had hoped
and expected that Gen'Call would in all important cases, have ob-
tained the papers alluded to in the latter part of M*Allen's communi-
cation but presume that he has not done so, as the only communica-
tion received at this office from him, is that of which a copy has been
forwarded to you.
I should think that in all cases where the original documents were
deposited and of record in Florida, and where the Spanish Gov" has,
contrary to the Treaty, taken them off, that the persons claiming
from Spain under that Treaty, thus violated, would be bound, in all
cases to produce the original documents in Court before the U. S.
went into trial. Where the original documents were properly of
record in Cuba, the reasons urged by the claimants for not producing
them may have some force, and it may be necessary for the Gov' of
the U.S. to make a demand for such originals. The frauds in rela-
tion to these cases are so extensive and so various, that I should think
that the Law Agent in Florida should be instructed to require the
production of the original papers in every case previous to going into
trial, and to obtain a rule of Court to that effect.—
Upon these points we wish y' views & opinions.”

$750 was all that would be allowed. A similar allowance had been
previously made to Gov” Miller of Arkensas, and mine without any

On my Superintendency, was set down at the same It was not untill
late in the year 1824 that by the muster rolls that I had taken of the
whole number of indians in Florida we assertained that their was up-
wards of 5,000, The department therefore, fixed the compensation, at
the time alluded to, without any knowledge of the number of Indians
their dispersed situation, or the expense likely to arrise in a wilder-
ness in a southern country. My allowance was therefore, placed at
$750 per annum only because that was the sum given to Gov Miller—
It is well known that he had very few Indians under his controll, and
that the few has since been removed-Gov. Miller resided in fact in
New England was seldom in his Territory. he kept no clerk rented
no office and incured no expence, that I ever heard of and if he re-
ceived $750 per annum he was under the circumstances much better
paid that I could have been if my allowance had been $1,500 *
Some time in the year 1826 in answer to one of my letters to the
Secretary of War on this subject, I was informed my compensation
as Supt. would be encreased $100.” I wrote to the Department I
should only be looser in future $50 per annum as the actual expences
of my office was only nine hundred Dollars It is not for the first time
I now complain. I have & do now insist, that justice has been with-
held from me, In a letter to your predecessor, Mr Barbour, I solic-
ited he would apply to Congress to change the law, so as to release
the Governor of Florida from the duties of Supt of Indian affairs,
giveing to the Agent the entire management of the Indians,” he was
authororised to lay my letter before a committee of congress which
also contained an offer to have $500 taken from my salary as Governor
(reducing it to $2,000 per annum) if this change could be effected. It
will oblige me much if this change can be made, at this, or the next
Session of Congress on the same terms—This desire arrises from the
fact. in 8 years I have acted as Superintendent of Indian affairs. I
have sunk $4,000, having been compelled to expended $500 per annum
in the discharge of my duties & the expences of my office, more than
my annual compensation $900 being the actual expences of the office
alone The trouble and labour of my duties as Supt have always been
greater than my other executive duties—

DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 7th May, 1830.
To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Govr of Florida & Supt
Ind: Affairs &c,
SIR, You have presented a claim to this Department, for extra
services, upon Indian affairs, from the 10th June, 1822, to the 10th of
August 1827, Within this period 257 days are charged for at 8$, a
day, making 2,056$; also 771$, for expenses incurred.
The law makes the Governors of Territories, ex-officio Superintend-
ents of Indian Affairs. No compensation is attached. By the Sec-
retary of War however, the sum of 750$, was given to you on account
of this service. Subsequently, in 1826, you were allowed the ad-
ditional sum of 100$,” making the entire allowance to you, as Super-
intendent, 850$, in all 2,827$.
At the period at which this allowance was made you had been per-
forming the duties which are now charged for, nearly four years. It
was proper then, that at that time your claim should have been pre-

sented. On the 20th of April 1824, I find a letter on file in this office,
of which the following is an extract. Speaking of the allowance of
750$, which was then made, the Secretary observes, “There is no
allowance made by law, for the performance of your duty as Superin-
tendent: but it is made as matter of justice, out of the appropriation
on account of Indian Affairs. No allowance of course can be made
by the Department, but to cover the expense which may be inciden-
tally incurred in the performance of such duty. If you think the
allowance to you, is not sufficient, to cover the expense, the Depart-
ment has no objection to commute it, for such sum as may be actu-
ally expended in the performance of your duty, on a statement being
made in the usual form, accompanied by the proper vouchers.”
In the decision here presented, the Secretary proceeded on the
ground that 750$, were sufficient. A choice at the same time was
presented, to take the sum offered, it being for expenses, or to reject
it, and receive the actual expenses which might be incurred; that an
authority did not exist, to make an allowance except on the ground,
to cover expenses, which might be incidentally incurred. Nothing
further appears to have been said until January 1826, when the sub-
ject, coming again to the consideration of the Secretary of War, the
additional sum of 100$ was allowed, making your compensation 850$,
at which it has ever since continued.
The services charged for on account of examining the titles to
Negroes, between Indians,—and Whites, and Indians, appear to me,
to have been quite a legitimate business as connected with the Super-
intendence of Indian Affairs. The assignment of this duty subse-
quently, to Judge Smith, is not a circumstance, whence to conclude
that the Department considered it unconnected with the supevision
of Indian Affairs. If in the discharge of this duty you were called
from home, and subjected to increased expenses, these being shown,
might render it proper, on my part, to admit an allowance correspond-
ing to your increased expenditures.
I consider this matter, as having been heretofore arranged, and
hence do not feel myself at liberty to disturb the arrangement. Even
were my opinion tho’ different, I could not pay you any thing because
I have no fund which would be applicable to such a claim.”—
Very Respectfully,
JOHN H. EATON.

SIR, I have to request that you will present to this Department,
with as little delay as possible, as required by the Regulations for-
warded to you, a project of the operations by which you propose to
improve the navigation of the S" Marks River, and that if it shall
appear to you necessary to employ other machinery than such as
may be procured on the spot, you will furnish such a description of
it as may enable the Department to order it for you in Baltimore,
or some other northern city, by which means (unless some other mode
of obtaining it shall appear to you preferable) unnecessary delay in
commencing the work, after the adoption of the project, will be
avoided." I am &c

WILLIAM WIRT TO GEORGE GRAHAM
[NA:SD, Fla. Archives:ALS]
BALTIMORE May 22, 1830
SIR, I think it was one of the instructions in the general letter
which I had the honor to address to the Sec: of the Treasury soon after
my employment in the land cases in Florida, that the claimants should
be required in every case to produce the original documents.” M*
Douglass the district attorney of East Florida, in one of his letters
stated that the claimants insisted on the hardship of being required
to produce originals—In my answer to him on the 9 July 1829 * I
say “I am still for your demanding the production of all original
papers whenever they are accessible. There is reason to beleive that
there is fraud in many of these cases, and it cannot be thoroughly
ferreted out but by the close and jealous inspection of original papers.
Authenticated copies obliterate those traces of fraud which would
stand revealed on the face of the originals. If you are to be direeted
checked & restrained in your call for originals let it be by the authority
of the Court.”—You perceive, therefore, that I have never had but
one opinion on the importance of demanding the production of original
papers, and the discoveries bought to light by pursueing this course
in Forbes' case, as mentioned by M. Allen,” is a striking illustration
of the propriety of this advice. At the same time it cannot be denied
that as our government has permitted the Spanish authorities to
carry off the original papers in violation of the treaty, there would be
great hardship in requiring individuals to compel Spain to surrender

those originals in compliance with the treaty—It is much more proper
that the Government which made the treaty should enforce an ob-
servance of it, than that individuals who have not the power should
be required to do it—If Spain alone was concerned, it would be very
proper to say to her we will confirm no titles proceeding from you,
unless you produce and deposit the originals in compliance with your
treaty—But spain, notwithstanding her profession of solicitude for
her subjects, would laugh at such a menace—and give herself no
further trouble about it—I think that, in justice to the Claimants as
well as to the United States, our government ought to exact a com-
pliance with the treaty and insist on the deposit at New Orleans of
all these records which were so improperly carried off—I think that no
time should be lost in making the demand and that the respective
Courts should be regularly informed by an official circular addressed
to the several district attornies, to be laid before their respective Courts,
that such a demand has been made and that the Government deems
the production of the originals essential to justice, in every case.-I
think that on such a communication the Courts would suspend pro-
ceedings until the effect of the demand on Spain should be ascertained.
Perhaps a demand on the Minister of Spain in this Country would
produce such an order from him as would induce the Gov' of Cuba to
return those papers *—The trial might be made and if he alleges a
want of power the demand should be made at Madrid.—This appears
to me be the regular course—and perhaps the only course by which
the originals could come back with their character of originals—There
may be some difficulty in authenticating originals drawn from Cuba
on private application. If they come under the sanction & authority
of the two Governments there will be no difficulty about it. The
subject, I think, is worthy of being brought immediately to the Pres-
idents notice—and of sufficient importance to the Country to call for
prompt action from the Department of State—If they think other-
wise, the next course is that recommended by M* Allen to send an
agent to Cuba, with a written authority to receive from the Governor,
there, all the records which according to the treaty ought to have been
left at New Orleans—and he might be furnished with a list of all the
suits now depending in the several courts of Florida in which the
originals are absent—such a specification may enable him to direct
his demand with precision, if a general demand should fail.-
Would it not be well for you to lay before the President M* Allen's
letter—as well as General Call's—I have a letter from the latter
Gentleman under date the 5* april " which I will bring down with

DEP OF STATE, W. 28 May 1830.
JAMES RINGGOLD Esq." Atty U.S. for the Middle Dist. of Fl"
SIR, Authentic information having reached this Department, that
many of the original documents relating to titles to lands in Florida,
which ought to have been delivered up at the time of the transfer of
that province to the United States, under the Treaty of 1819 with
Spain, are now deposited in the different Departments of the Colonial
Government of Cuba,” instructions have been given to the Minister
of the U.S. at Madrid, to apply to the King of Spain for an order to
the Captain General of that Island, to deliver up to the authorised
agent of this Government, all such documents, belonging to the
Archives of Florida, as may, by any means whatsoever, have found
their way into the offices under his jurisdiction.” These instructions
have been transmitted by a special messenger, and there is every
reason to believe that the application to be made under them will
receive the prompt attention of the Spanish Government—
It has been further represented to this Department by the Counsel
employed on the part of the U.S. in the trial of several cases, involv-
ing important landed interests, that those, and other similar cases
now depending in the various Courts in the Territory of Florida, can-
not be decided upon principles of justice and existing law, without
the production of the original documents above referred to.—Under
these circumstances, the President has directed me to instruct the
Attornies of the U. S. for all the Districts within which, such cases
may be pending, to state to the Courts the facts above mentioned,
and to move a suspension of all those trials wherein the original docu-
ments cannot be produced, until the result of the application directed
to be made to the Spanish Goverment, shall have been made known
to them thro' this Department.—You will accordingly conform to
these directions, in all the cases brought before the Courts within
your District, involving the titles to lands under grants from the
Spanish Colonial Authorities.”—
I am with great Respect Your obed" Serv"

PRESENTIMIENTS OF THE GRAND JURY OF THE SUPERIOR

[NA:SD, Misc. Letters.:C]
[May 29, 1830]
At a Session of the Superior Court for the Southern Judicial Dis-
trict of Florida held at Key West in the County of Monroe on the
Eight day of May one thousand Eight hundred and thirty Present
the Honorable James Webb
On this day the Grand jury Came into Court and through their
foreman Feilding A Browne Esqr made the following presentments,
“to Wit.
The Grand jury now in Session, in and for the County of Monroe;
present that it is a matter of great importance in the futherance of
justice and the due Administration of the Law, that a sufficient jail
should be erected at Key West; in said county sufficiently secure to
Contain prisoners and Large enough for there Comfort and health,
The want of a jail is so much felt at each term of this Court; that they
Cannot refrain from presenting the subject again although they have
repeatedly made remonstrances upon this Subject; many offences go
unpunished in Consequence of having no secure place to Confine the
accused; before trial, or to punish him after it.
A Cistern sufficiently spacious to hold rain water for the use of the
Officers of the Court House and during the time of holding Court is
absolutely necessary, It could be excavated in the solid Rock at a
small expence and its importance as supplying pure fresh water Can-
not be sufficiently appreciated unless it is known that the water pro-
cured from the wells on the Island is highly impregnated with Lime-
stone and is never drank by the inhabitants when rain water Can be
procured.
At the time the House now belonging to the United States and
Used as a Court House was erected, it was intended to put around it
a Gallery which in this Climate is absolutely Necessary to render a
house habitable, particularly during the summer months, Labor and
materials being at that time dear and difficult to be procured, it was
postpond, and has not yet been done, materials and Labor, are now
at a reasonable price and the preservation of the building, as well as
the Comfort and health of the Occupants of it, require that galleries

SIR I have the Honour to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the
25" May,” Inclosing a Copy of a Letter to you, from M* Wirt, dated
22nd May."—
I am gratified to learn, that the Subject of my Letter of 23"April "
is deemed by him of sufficient Importance to the Country, to require
the prompt action of the Government upon it, and I feel anxious to
learn the Determination of the President in regard to the Suggestions
contained in M* Wirts Letter.—
The Original Papers have been demanded of the Claimants in all
Cases, where they were not in the first Instance produced and filed,
but the Claimants reply to this Demand, by alledging, that the Orig-
inals are not in eur their possession or power; that they were removed
by the Spanish authorities to Havana, where they still are; that it is
in the power of the Government alone, to Demand and obtain them,
and that so long as Spain is permitted, by the Government of the
United States to retain the custody of papers which properly belong
to the United States under the Treaty, without an Effort to procure
* On Dec. 30, 1829 (House Journal, 21 Cong., 1 sess., p. 111), Del. White pre-
sented a petition from the inhabitants of Apalachicola for a sale of the lands on
which they had located and requesting pay for their improvements if lost to other
purchasers. The text of the petition has not been found. Another petition
presented on Jan. 25, 1830 (ibid., p. 200), from inhabitants of West Point on
Apalachicola Bay, requested that preemption rights to town lots not be granted
to persons petitioning for them. The text of this petition has not been found.

has been noted. Cf. post, p. 516.

their return, the United States virtually acknowledge, that the De-
tention of Spain those Documents by Spain is rightful; and that of
consequence certified Copies must be received in Evidence.
I confess, that it appears to me very Difficult successfully to reply
to this argument, and my Opinion has been that the Courts would
sustain it, and permit Copies to be read in testimony. Entertaining
this Opinion, I thought it my Duty to present it to the Consideration
of the President and to suggest the necessity of the immediate action
of the Government for its own protection and Defence, against De-
mands on Her Domain of more than a million of acres in Amount,
which there are many reasons to believe are fraudulent.
The proper mode to effect the Object, I have no Doubt, is that
suggested by M. Wirt, and that the Demand should be made upon
the Sovereign of Spain at Madrid, but I would respectfully suggest,
whether the Services of an Agent in Directing the search among old
papers. for such as may be interresting, on the trial of these Cases,
and in receiving such as may be found, will not be indispensible to
the success of the project.—It is a fact which will not be denied, that
those Claimants most deeply interrested, reside at Havanna, or have
friends and relatives there, who will be able to thwart the Views of
the Government, unless she is represented by an active and intelli-
gent Agent, on the Spot, who if he is well informed of the Character
of the papers of most Importance to the Government, would be able
to counteract, in a great Degree, the Influence of the Claimants, and
others upon the under officers and secretaries of the Government of
Cuba.”

requested that I would forward your letter to me, immediately to M*
Wirt. Your letter was therefore forwarded to M'. Wirt, & one of the
Gent" in the Office was requested, to acknowledge the receipt of y"
letter and advise you of its disposition. This I thought had been
done but it seems that it was omitted. A Communication has been
rec" from M* Allen recommending that another special Agent should
be sent to Cuba for the purpose of obtaining original papers.” This
letter was also by the direction of the President, submitted to M*
Wirt, and a copy of his answer forwarded to M*Allen.” Hearing that
M. Wirt was in the City, about the period of the adjournment of
Congress, I sent him word, that if he would call upon me I would go
with him to the Presidents for the purpose of having a interview on the
subject of these claims generally. He did call, but finding that I was
unable to attend him, he took the papers and said he would himself
see the President. I subsequently understood from the President,
that he had requested M. Wirt to call at the State Dept: & ascertain
what measures had been taken as well for the obtaining the original
papers relative to private claims, as the certified copies of the royal
orders. and correspondence of the Spanish Gov' required by the
Supreme Court previous to giving an opinion in cases that have been
argued before it. Not seeing M* Wirt afterwards and having ever
since been confined to my room by indisposition I do not know what
specific measures have been taken on the subject, farther than that
a special messenger has been sent to carry the instructions to our
Minister at the Court of Spain,”—I will thank you to show this

of those charges. I can answer only in the negative.
Before your arival in this Territory, there was some expression of
feeling against you, on account of the appointment of Secretary,
having been given to a nonresident. it could not have been personal,
because I believe you were an intire stranger to the people. I be-
came acquainted with you immediately on your arival among us, and
being a member of the Legislative Council was frequently in your
Company last fall, and our friendly intercourse has continued. I
have never at any time heard you make a remark, that could Justify
in the Slightest degree either of those charges, nor have I heard any
other person so charge you. I think your deportment since you have
been in Florida ought to Contridict the last charge; as, I believe it
has had the effect of removing the prejudices which were entertained
towards you, before you were known "

Altho' further time has been given by the Act for deciding upon a
portion of these claims, yet I do not think that this ought to prevent
Our commencing the surveys in East Florida in the month of Novem-
ber next.—
Your surveys should commence by subdividing those Townships
which have been already run out South of the St. Marys and East of
the Suwannee and including Amelia, and the other Islands along the
Coast. The instructions heretofore given to you respecting the sur-
veying of the public Lands and private claims are so particular that
nothing farther suggests itself to me on those points, at present, except
to call your attention to the animadversions of the Reg & Rec' in
their report on the surveys made by M Clarke,” which correspond
with the views of this Office as heretofore communicated to you; and
the surveys of M* Clarke cannot be considered as valid except where
they may be established by their intrinsic calls, or where they may
stand the test of blocking-out, as heretofore suggested to you. I
would also suggest the necessity of your requiring the Deputies to be
particularly accurate in connecting their surveys on the large Water
courses, so that those Water courses may be correctly exhibited on our
Maps. I am aware that the St Johns River will present much diffi-
culty in this respect, but it is indispensably necessary that we should
be enabled to lay it down accurately from the returns of the Surveyors.
With respect to the claims for which Royal titles were obtained
subsequent to the 24th of January 1818, & which have to be reported
by the Reg & Rec" to the next Session of Congress. I think it advis-
able as some of these claims may be confirmed hereafter, that altho’
the lines of the public Surveys will have to run through them, yet that
the lines of the claims themselves should also be run out & so connected
with the public lines as to enable you, in the event of the confirmation
of any one of them, to have it accurately laid down on the plat, and
the contents of the adjacent fractions correctly known without being
at the trouble and expense of sending a Deputy to make a survey of
that particular claim.
The extent of the private claims, and the inherent difficulties inci-
dent to the surveying of them, and the extent of the discretionary
powers, necessarily vested in the Deputies, imposes upon you the
responsibility of employing only such Deputies as possess a thorough
knowledge of their business, and whose integrity and honesty are
unquestionable. It is, however, desireable that as many Deputies of
this description as can be procured should be employed and the survey-
ing not confined to a very few individuals.

You will observe that the 7th & 8th Sections have changed the law
relative to the location and selection of some of the private claims
heretofore surveyed, and to which sections I beg leave to call your
attention. Altho' I regret this change in the law, it will in some meas-
ure facilitate the surveys and selections to be made and will enable
you to Survey the Islands covered by private claims without difficulty.
x * The claimant of the Island of Key West *has been exceedingly
anxious to have that Island surveyed, and as the present law removes
all difficulty on the subject, I have to request that you will have it
surveyed as soon as practicable. With respect to the Islands on
the Eastern Coast of Florida, I presume that there will be little diffi-
culty in connecting them with the Township & in giving the surveys
their sectional numbers, but it is apprehended that this will not be the
case in relation to Key West, and those Islands and Keys which extend
South West from the point of Florida. In relation to them your
Surveyors must exercise a sound discretion; they should however be
so particularized and designated on a connected plat as to enable us
to patent them with facility and certainty—the bearings and distances
of one Island from the others should be particularly stated *

SIR I now enclose you my accounts as finally closed in the case of
the contract with M Kingsley for the improvement of the inland
navigation between the St Marys & S" Johns river—
The report of Gen" Bernard on the estimate made, contemplated
the removal of certain obstructions enumerated so as to admit the
free passage of small boats at any stage of the tide *—In a former
letter " I stated that the channel or creek, at the Amelia Narrows
was so intricate and crooked that I thought no improvement within
the amount awarded could essentially benefit the navigation and I

therefore recommended as a substitute the cutting of a canal from a
deep creek flowing into Belle river to the waters of Nassau—This cut
or canal without the clearing out of the creek which unites it with
Nassau river, has been completed so as to admit of the passage of
Wessels at high tides drawing not more than 5% to 6 feet water—When
I last inspected it there was 7 feet water in the canal—on examining
the marsh on the commencement of operations, a semi liquid was en-
countered at a foot or two above the level of low tide, & apprehensions
were at first entertained of the impracticability of penetrating below
it—Every effort to do so endangered the banks; the Canal was there-
fore excavated to that level the last Summer & left for the currents of
the flood & ebb tides to act on it—As was conjectured, these proved
beneficial, & on resuming the work this spring we were enabled to
complete the cut & creek to the depth mentioned above—Still appre-
hending some further injury from the currents I have under bond
obligated Mr Kingsley to clean out the creek & canal this fall & make
any reperations to the banks which may be necessary—
This became the more important as the current in the Canal at
flood tide is much more rapid than I had anticipated and has occa-
sioned a regret on my part, that I had not given a greater width to
the canal at first-
I am still however inclined to the opinion (which has derived much
strength from the experience of the last year) that the current will
ultimately perform the work we wish, more effectually than the labor
of man, provided on every encroachment on the banks the mud
caving in be removed from the bottom of the canal—The slope to
the sides will then be more regular & permanent as it will receive the
inclination the soil is best capable of sustaining and which is among
the most serious defficulties encountered in working in every irregular
mixtures of sand, mud & marine shells—
The Talbot dividings have been left as they were found. some ex-
cavations made through the bars formed across the channel satisfied
me that no work at that point could be permanent without an entire
removal of the whole bank stretching across the pass and to some
distance from the place—The bank consists of sand & mud & refils
any excavation made upon each succeeding tide—I therefore de-
ducted from the Contract the amt of work that was to have been per-
formed at that place
At the Sisters a channel has been cut through the Oyster bank, so
as to admit of the depth & width contemplated—To shorten the dis-
tance a cut was made last fall in a straight direction, but this not
according with the current it refilled In the new cut advantage has
been taken of the tides & will I trust prove permanent—The Con-

tractor however is obligated in this case, as at the Amelia cut, to re-
move any injury sustained between this & the succeeding fall-
The navigation between the S" Marys & St Johns rivers, may now
be considered open at high tide for any of the Coasting schooners
drawing not more than 5% to 6 feet water and boats may pass the
Amelia cut & Sisters, the extremities of the passage at so early a stage
of the flood as generally to be at the Talbot dividings at the favour-
able stage of the waters half or full tide, so as not to be impeded by
that obstruction—
This navigation however, as connected with the proposed canal
across the Penensula of Florida, may be deemed sufficiently important
to be improved, so as to admit of the free passage of Coasting Schoon-
ers & Steam boats at any stage of the tides—I have therefore thought
it would be acceptable (& shall so soon as I can obtain certain data
on which to form an estimate) forward you a plan for its improve-
ment at the least cost *

The course pursued by me, last Winter, at Washington in regard

Shortly after my arrival in Washington, I addressed a Letter to
the Sect of State upon the Subject of the appointments emanating
from that Department, that had been made in Florida.”—It contained
an explanation of my general views, on Grounds of public expediency
and policy, but your name was not mentioned.—After your nomina-
tion to the Senate, I addressed a communication to that Body in
which I protested against the Confirmation of several appointments,
and among them yours."—The Objections urged by me were entirely
general, and were made as expressing the sentiments of those I
represented.
There were no accusations or objections of a personal Character,
or anything derogatory to your reputation, or calculated to wound
your feelings, or those of your friends, made by me in that Communi-
cation, or otherwise—I had no motive to assail you personally, as
you had never offered me offence or Injury.
While I shall always endeavour to do my duty to my constituents
faithfully and firmly, without regard to Consequences to myself, I
shall never avail myself of my Situation as Delegate, to inflict wanton
injury on the feelings & character of any one.
There were representations by Letters, & otherwise, made to me
while at Washington, of your Course here, calculated to induce earnest
and strenuous opposition, on my part, to your nomination, & its
confirmation, (with which I have no repugnance, fully to acquaint
you, as you request) but before I would have urged these against you,
I would first have given you notice of them.—To Senators with whom
I conversed on the Subject, I so expressed myself.
About the time of the approval of your nomination, I received Let-
ters from several of my friends in Florida, which spoke of you in
different terms from the representations alluded to; & from which, I
state with great satisfaction, I inferred that many persons had done
you Injustice, (doubtless through misconception and misinformation)
& had I pursued a different course than the one I have stated, I
should regret it.
Misrepresentations have, I expect been made to you and to others,
of my course towards you, as are made of most other of my acts, by
some who find pleasure, and conceive they see their Interest in so
doing, but I do not doubt, that upon looking at my Correspondence
on the Subject, which I will cheerfully submit to your inspection, and
upon seeking for correct information from better sources, you will
be entirely satisfied you have no right to complain of it.

SIR, I have this day required for you the sum of two Thousand
dollars being the amount of an appropriation made at the last Session
of Congress to compleat the repair of the road from Alaqua to Mariana
in Florida *—You will visit that part of the country and take measures
to have the repairs made. An inspection of the repairs made last
year by Captain Burch, on the Tallahassee Road will give you a better
idea of the manner of repairing the section confided to your superin-
tendence than any written instructions which I could give you at this
distance-I rely on your judgement to apply the appropriation to the
best advantage—
Pine poles must not be used in constructing bridges as they are of
such a nature, as by rotting to be rendered good for nothing in a
short time—Juniper, light wood and heart of pine, are the only
materials that are to be used for any bridges that may be erected on
the route.
Hands, I am told, may be employed on better terms in the vicinity
of the road than elsewhere—
Judge Breckenridge, who resides near the road, and is well ac-
quainted with the Country, can give much useful information and
advice in regard the work—I will thank you to see and consult him;
and should you find it necessary to appoint an Agent to act in your
absence, he would be a suitable person; and he has proffered his
services in any way that he can be useful."

with deeds to Mess" Doyle * and Carruthers for the lands purchased
by them from Gen' Lafayette.
With regard to your inquiry whether a company can be formed at
Tallahassee to purchase from ten to fifteen Sections of Gen Lafayettes
land on either the East or North of the Township, I cannot at this
moment give a satisfactory reply, I will therefore make the necessary
inquiry and will write you again on the subject.
To your 2" inquiry I must reply that I do not believe that a sale of
that number of Sections could be promptly made to individuals, at
good prices though I am of opinion that such a sale might be made
during the winter.
I do not conceive it would be adviseable te at the next land Sales to
offer the land of Gen' Lafayette as the time would be too short to give
the necessary notice to those who might wish to purchase. If a com-
pany should not be formed which will purch the quantity proposed,
I think by giving five or six months notice, of a sale at auction that
these lands might be sold to considerable advantage. Many of the
tracts are of the most superior quality, and are well worth the price
you mention. By selling for one forth cash and the balance in four
anual instalments, I think they would bring their value. In the
mean time if you are disposed to make the experiment of selling at
private sale, if you will give me the necessary instructions I will
advertise them and I have no doubt that some sales would be made in
a very short time, and perhaps by the expiration of the Six months as
much might be disposed of as you wish to sell at present. These
lands have not yet attained their value, and perhaps they may not
for several years, owing to the great quantity of wild lands in the
country. Every experiment in agriculture however is attended with
favourable results, and I see nothing to prevent them from becoming
very valuable in a few years. The lands in the neighbourhood of
Tallahassee are improving in reputation every year as they improve
in product. No doubt is entertained of their capasity to produce
sugar crops to great advantage, but the value and quantity of cotton
produced to the acre, renders it very doubtful whe [MS. torn] the
latter is not the best staple, as it [MS. torn] which may be prepared for
market with [MS. torn] little expense. On our best lands the Planter
may calculate with great confidence on making even at the present low

SIR I have now the honour to Report the progress of the work

of St Marks) for the month ending the 31st day of Augst."
The opperations which on account of the sickness in the force em-
ployd, had been suspended on the 10th July were resumed on the 10th
of August and confined to that part of the work which had been left
unfinish" between this place and the “Little rapids”
All the trees in this section overhanging the river or standing on its
banks, so as to impede the free passing of vessels by entangling their
yards and masts have been removed
The removal of the logs already fallen into the river has been more
tedious than was expected and consiquently has taken more time
than was intimated in my last report, nevertheless this section will
in two or three more days be finish"
It is my purpose then to remove the force to the mouth of the river
and ascend regularly removeing such difficulties as immediately re-
tards navigation. They do not compare, with the work already done
on account of the increased width of the river, nor do I think they
will occupy more time than what was spent in the first section
The work goes on regularly and with a strict eye to economy in
which I am much aided by the contract with Ma” Chaires for the
supply of the requisit hands.” There is less sickness amongst them

The repairs of the road have been completed to within fifteen miles

between St. John's River and Alachua Court house, which I was
directed not to repair in your letter of the 22" of January.”
On my last visit to the party engaged on the road, I calculated that
it would be completed by the 15" of August, and fearing that the ap-
propriation might be exceeded, I directed the party to be discharged
on that day, -however on the Settlement of the claims, I find that

been completed three miles south of Spruce Creek a distance of
twenty miles.—
The slow progress which has been made on this road is atributable
to the distance, and difficulty, of transportation of every article of
subsistence, and material—the construction of many Bridges and
causeways, through low grounds.—In consequence of the unhealthi-
ness of the country, and almost incredible annoyance to the horses
by flies, I have discharged the party at work on the road, until the
return of the healthy season, which will be about the 1* of November.
The person whom I employed to superintend, and twe three of the
carpenters employed in constructing a bridge over Spruce creek,
have returned to St: Augustine with a very severe fever, and the
principal owner of the slaves was unwilling to continue them at this
season of the year.—
I have now remaining nine hundred and ninety one dollars, and
about five hundred dollars in property from the appropiation applicable
to the road which will be sufficient to complete it to New Smyrna, as
the most difficult part is already finished. The whole will be com-
pleted about the 15" of December.

sustained material injury by the late storm, but from the remittance
of $5369. and */100 there is a balance remaining of $520=*/100 which
will be sufficient to put it in good order.
I enclose a statement of expences incurred in constructing the bridge
and causeway, as there appears to be some difference in my statement,
and the Official statements forwarded to me from your office arising
thus—
Official statement of my accounts for the 4* Quarter 1829 no men-

Extra service in November amounted to $10:*%00—in December to

on that property, from George Murray who sold to them, and in whose
name, if I am not mistaken the claim was recommended for confirma-
tion. There are two questions connected with the case in which
Strongs heirs are interested. first could the present owners without
the consent of the Mortgagees take the quantity of one league square,
and secondly would the patent to them direct, effect their interest.
The mortgages are in my possession and are recorded both at St
Augustine, and in the County Court at Key West. Strongs heirs
live in Connecticut and New York and most of them are minors I
presume that before the patents issue that the Department will see
that no third party is to be injured by it. I think that you will find
that the claim as brought before the Commissioners was for a larger
quantity than a league (square) and was in the name of George
Murray.

SIR I have now the honour to report the progress of the work under
my charge (the removal of obstructions in the river and harbour of
St Marks) for the month ending 30th Sept.
After the completion of the section between the “little rapids” and
this place the whole force was removed to the mouth of the river
where they opperated in two gangs (one on each side) removeing such
trees as overhung and such as had fallen into it That section be-
tween the mouth and the rapids about seven miles in distance has
been so far completed as to permit the force to be employd above
on the section between this and Rock Haven or the head of the river.
In this section it will be my purpose only to remove such difficulties
as can be done at little expense improveing the river for scow navi-
gation. The improvements below is all that I consider it Judicious
or fair to undertake (viewing the amt appropriated) until the work in
the harbour shall have been commenced and so far prosecuted or com-
pleted as to warrant the belief that a sum of the appropriation may
be left which will Justify an attempt to make some improvement at
the rapids by deepening the channel.
I consider it also my duty to report an inaccuracy in the Survey
and report of Colo Macomb which if not understood by the Eng"

Depart- might create the question why the improvements as they
have been and are still makeing in the St Marks river He states in
the report of his survey that the river is 100 yards wide with occasional
Variations from the head to its Junction with the Wacully. If this
had been the case there would have been no cause for the expenditure
that has taken place in its improvement. But in no place within the
space mentioned does the width exceed 50 yards and generally less
than 35 yds. It is however not common to find so exceedingly narrow
a river to afford as great a depth of water except at the rapids aver-
ageing 13 feet from Magnolia to St. Marks.
I would further suggest the propriety of forwarding with all possible
despatch the Machine for the opperations in the Harbour.

mended to the Secretary of the Treasury, Nov. 12, 1830 (NA, GLO Misc. Lets.
Sent, Bk. 2), that $8,000 be remitted to Butler for surveys east of the Suwannee
and south of the St. Marys. Butler was informed the same day (loc. cit., Lets. to
SG, IV) that this sum would be sent to him despite limited funds and the lack of
an appropriation.

priation was based, submitted by the Chief Engineer to Andrew Stevenson,
Speaker of the House of Representatives, is in NA (WD, CE Lets. Issued, Inter.

1831 when he left on furlough to visit his native France and on July 31, 1832, he

survey. Reports and other correspondence from the two men charged with the
survey have been registered in NA (WD, CE) but the texts have not been found.

GENERAL I have the honor to report my return from the examina-
tion of the road from Alagua to Mariana, as directed by your letter
of the 28* July last,” after making an estimate of the cost of the
repairs necessary, I offered some sections of it to the lowest bidder to
be made by contract, and finding that the work could be done on
better terms in that way, I contracted with three persons in the
neighborhood of the road, to do the work on three sections of it,”
Which includes the distance form Alagua to oak hill within sixteen
miles of Mariana, from oak hill to Mariana, there is no direct road,
the one now used is about four miles out of the way, in consiquence
of Which I was requested by several persons in Mariana, not to expend
any Money on the old rout, they at the same time informed me that
commissioners had been appointed at the last Session of their Court
to run and cut out a road on a direct line from that to oak hill and
Which would be immediately carried into execution. and they would
be glad any money that might be expended would be put on the new
road, Which together with the fact of the old route being a very bad
one, induced me to defer the repairs on that part of the route until
the new road is cut out
The road as far as oak hill will be completed on or before the 15"
of Jan' next and I am very confident it will not onley be well done,
but at much less expense than I could do it by employing hands, &
teams and persons to Superintend them *

ELIJAH HAYWARD34* TO ROBERT BUTLER
[NA:GLO, Lets. to SG, Iv]
Oct. 26th. 1830.
ROBERT BUTLER, Esq S Gen.' Tallahassee. F.
SIR, In reply to your letter of the 21st Ulto.” I have to inform you
that there are $8000 remaining of the appropriation for the survey
of private Land claims of which such portion may be applied to the
survey of those claims as will fall within the limits of the townships
to be surveyed this winter, and the ensuing spring.
As to the funds that can be appropriated for the surveying of the
public Lands in Florida during the present year, I do not believe that
of the remaining balance of the general fund (there having been no
appropriation for surveys made by Congress at the last Session) more
than $10.000 can be spared for your Department. This fact however
need not interfere with your surveying operations, inasmuch as the
appropriation for the year 1831. will have been made before the
surveys will be returned to your Office.
You will therefore proceed to act agreeably to the instructions of
my predecessor in his letter bearing date 10th July 1830.”
I would call your special attention to the imperious necessity of
urging on your Deputies the observance of every possible accuracy
and care in every branch of their duty. The difficulties and embar-
rassments resulting from the want of skill or inattention in the making
of a survey, cause endless trouble to your Office and to the Department.
I would therefore take occasion to refer you to the letter of my
predecessor of 10th July last, and to state in addition thereto that
your Deputy Surveyors should be made expressly to understand that
whenever the private claims cannot be made to protract from the
courses and distances exhibited in the field notes, and whenever they
are found not to connect with the public land, in the same or the ad-
joining township, it is prima-facie evidence that error exists in the
field, which error must necessarily be corrected at the expense of the
Dep’ Surveyor.
As a further means of obviating errors I would suggest the recur-
rence to the standard chain, and comparison therewith of the chains
used by the Deputies as often as practicable, and always before enter-
ing on the survey under a new Contract.
It is expected at this Office that the township plats will indicate

Office in succession to George Graham, deceased. He was nominated Dec. 14

both by letters and by distinctive colors all swamps and ponds, and
the extent of them, and also indicate the existence of every natural
object which may either tend to gratify the curiosity of the public or
to afford useful official information as to the topography of the country.
With these views I would request that your instructions to your
\Deputies may be drawn up with special minuteness.
In cases where the Surveyors meet with Townships which by reason
of sterility are not worth subdividing, the exterior township lines
only are to be run, with the view to maintain the connexion of the
public surveys, and in all cases where a part only of a Township can
be surveyed, the cause or causes which rendered it inexpedient or
impracticable to survey the residue are to be particularly indicated
on the township plat—and any Deputy Surveyor who shall be found
to omit completing the survey of a township, from no other cause
than that it did not meet his convenience so to do should not here-
after be employed.
You state the necessity of your being furnished with ten or twelve
copies of the Reports on Florida land claims for the use of your
Deputies, a copy of each report has heretofore been transmitted to
your Office, and there remain no copies at the disposal of this Office.
As the claims are to be surveyed by law on the evidence to be fur-
nished by the Keeper of the Archives, it is not believed that the Re-
ports if in their possession would furnish any facilities to the Deputies
in the execution of their duties.

SIR, The instructions heretofore given in relation to the survey of
the Island of Key West *may be executed, as soon as circumstances
will admit.
There is nothing in the law which need delay or prevent the execu-
tion of that survey, and as neither the interest of individuals nor that
of the Gov" can be affected injuriously by the fact of the survey being
made, I would call your early attention to the subject.—

view to ascertain its true contents. The discrimination between the
portion thereof that will remain to the public and the portion that
will accrue to the claimant under the law, will not be ascertained until
the provisions of the law requiring a relinquishment of title to the
U.S. of all the quantity claimed over one league square, shall have
been duly complied with.
If the Island should have a bluff—Coast the survey will be simple
& easy. If parts of it, however, should more or less be affected by
the tides, the survey is to be ordered as to exhibit the area at ordinary
low tides; and it is further desired that you will report as nearly as
can be estimated, the difference between the area of the Island at
ordinary low, & ordinary high tide, and indicate the same by some
particular colour on the plat of survey.—
You will be advised in a few days respecting other subjects con-
nected with your letter of the 21st Ulto.”

8th Nov. 1830.
COL” ROBERT BUTLER, S G. Tallahassee F.
SIR, In pursuance of advices from the Sec of the Treasury,” issued
on the recommendation of the Navy Department, I have to request
that you will be pleased to instruct your Deputy Surveyors to notice
in their progress those tracts of the public lands which produce live
Oak or other timber valuable for naval purposes in the vicinity of
navigable Streams.
The live oak of all sizes is the principal object to which it is desired
to direct their attention. The long leaf yellow pine and Palmetto,
where they are found in sufficient quantities being also said to be
valuable for the purposes of the Navy Dept, it is also required and
expected that the surveyors will notice them.—
As it is not contemplated by the Dep" to make any reservations
of timber lands at a greater distance than three miles back from raft
navigation, the observations of the Surveyors need not extend beyond
that distance.—
The surveyors are expected to make such observations in their
field notes in relation to the extent and abundance of the several kinds
of timber referred to, as will enable you with accuracy to exhibit
such lands on your township plats with a view to their future reserva-
tion for sale. A discriminating colour should therefore be used for all
Lands proposed to be reserved for the purposes of the Navy Dept."
I am &c.

[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 7]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs, 8" November, 1830.
To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida,
SIR, Your letters to the Secretary of War of the 11th * and 18th
Ultimo,” are received.
In reply to your suggestion for the appointment of a special agent,
I am directed to inform you that it is the duty of the Indian agent,
under your directions, to attend to claims for slaves, both, of the
Indians and white people, and all other claims growing out of their
intercourse with each other, and to collect and report all such infor-
mation and evidence in relation to the same as may be necessary to
a correct decision, and that no special agent can therefore be appointed
for that purpose.
As to withholding the annuity as a mean of compelling the delivery
of negroes by the Indians, I am directed to say, that it is doubted,
whether there is any authority to touch the annuity of the Indians,
except for claims allowed under the act of intercourse of 1802,” and
that as the claims for slaves are not considered as embraced by that
act, it would be improper to withhold the annuity for any purpose
connected with them—especially when the title is still in dispute
between the Indians and the claimants. It is believed that in most
of the cases, the slaves claimed are of the description referr'd to in
the 7" article of the treaty with the Florida Indians "–and that if
the claimants will authorize the agent to offer the Indians a reasonable
compensation for apprehending and delivering them, as provided
for by said article, there is little doubt it would lead to the recovery
of the negroes in many instances, where other means have failed.
This being the course pointed out by the treaty, the Secretary directs
that it be pursued."—
I am, very Respectfully Yr Obt Serv"

slaves unless force were used or the annuity suspended. Regarding Mrs. Hannay's
slaves see also Humphreys to McKenney, Feb. 16, 1830, and Westcott to the

SIR, Your letter to the Secretary of War of the 2nd Inst" advising
of your bill for 1000$, on account of the school fund provided for by
the treaty with the Florida Indians, has been received.
I am directed by the Secretary of War to state, that as the treaty
with the Florida Indians stipulates for a school at the agency, the
expenditure of the money for the education of boys in Kentucky,
(where the expenses will of course be greatly increased and beyond
what the fund may be adequate to meet) would not be a proper
fulfilment of the treaty stipulation, and might therefore occasion
* A letter from Del. White, Dec. 4, 1830 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.), asked
that the land which had been claimed between the Apalachicola and the Chatta-

* This is a reference to the case of Julie Soulard, the widow of Antoine Soulard,
the former Spanish surveyor general of Upper Louisiana, and her children against
the United States. In this case the Supreme Court had postponed a decision
until supplied with information relative to the laws and principles under which
land titles had been issued by the Spanish Government (Jan. 1830, 4 Peters, 511).
A decision in favor of the appellants was finally given in Jan. 1836 (10 Peters,

26th Nov. 1830.
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U STATES
SIR, In reply to your remarks referring the enclosed communication
to this office,” I have the honor to report that we have no means of
ascertaining whether or not the parties signing the paper are entitled
to preEmption rights, under either of the Acts referred to.—
It appears, however, that the Lands to which they allude yet remain
to be surveyed, and in connection with the surveying of which, is the
subject of extending the surveys along a considerable line of the Coast
between St Rosa and the Apilachicola Bays, along which it is probable
there are other individuals who may assert claims under the preFmp-
tion Law of 1830." The reasons why those surveys have not yet
been made can probably be explained by Col" Butler, and as the only
means that the Department can adopt towards accomplishing the
wishes of the parties interested, I intend making a communication to
Col° Butler on the subject of surveying in that quarter of his Surveying
Department.”
The individuals signing the paper are in error if they suppose that
they have a right to cut down Timber from public Lands before those
Lands are surveyed and sold to them either as Pre Emption rights or
other wise.
I am &c.

SIR I have now the honour to report the progress of the operations
of removing obstructions in the River and harbour of St. Marks for
the Month ending the 30th day of November 1830. All the obstruc-
tions (“artificial,,) in the river from its source to its mouth have been
removed with the exception of some grass growing on the rocks in the
bed of the river at the “Little rapids, and which I purpose to remove
in two or three days. The other difficulties at this point being a ledge
* Not found.
* The act approved May 29, 1830 (4 STAT. 420–421), provided that settlers who
had cultivated public land in 1829 and were still in possession of it, could enter
up to one quarter section.

of rocks extending across and a distanct of 100 yards up and down the
river is a subject which I yet retain for further examination and report.
This being a “natural, obstruction and in the bed of the river I do
not consider it proper to molest it until an improvement is made in
the channel at the “Devils Elbow” and “Middle ground”, besides
which it is my opinion in which I am seconded by men of experience
and Judg” that to attempt to depen the channel at the rapids by
blasting or otherwise removeing the Rock would exaust more of the
apropriation than it would be Judicious or fair to apply to that object.
It is my impression however that a considerable aditional depth of
water could be had at this point by a Lock built at the foot of the fall
which (as the materials are at hand) could be accomplishd for a
moderate sum, The fall is considerable, a current constantly setting
down, although the tide rises and falls in it 2 feet 4 inches. The
width of the river at this point is about thirty yards and would require
if lock" an enbankment on each side 3 feet in height and a distance
of 150 yards in extent The depth of the River from its mouth to this
place is not less and generally upwards of 10 feet at low water except
at the two points call" the “long” and “Little Rapids” on the first of
which there is only 7 feet 2 Inches and a tide rising 2 feet 10 Inches,
at the other 4 feet 7 Inches and a tide of 2 feet 4 Inches, No improve-
ment therefore can be desireable if even practicable at the first place
but I think the lock will create 3 feet more water at the second place
and of course would add greatly to the convenience of commerce. I
may be premature in those suggestions will therefore make an estimate
of the cost of the work I mention and submit it with my opinion finally
on that point,
The hands employd I have discharged with the exception of a few
who are engaged in cuting wood for the Machine to be used in the
harbour which I find more economical than paying the price p" cord
demanded for it.”
I am very Respy Your Obt. Servt.

ROBERT BUTLER Esq S. G. Tallahassee.
SIR, Enclosed is a copy of a communication from Rufus Sewall and
others of Florida,” complaining that they are not able to avail them-
selves of the pre-emption laws in consequence of the land on which
they reside not having been surveyed. The writers falsely suppose
that they have a right to cut down timber from the public land before
the same has been actually disposed of to them.
This communication has brought into view the necessity of com-
pleting the surveys along the whole line of coast between Apalachicola
and St. Rosa bays for the purpose of enabling the Government to
dispose of such portions of the land as it may not be expedient to
reserve for Naval purposes, as the live oak & other timber valuable
for the Navy abound in that region.
In order to enable the Government to make the most judicious
reservations, you are requested to instruct your Surveyors to make
the most particular observations they can, to admit of the indication
on the township plats of the tracts to be reserved in the mode pointed
out in my letter of the 8" ultimo. The enclosed diagram will serve
to point out the line of coast referred to—the pencilling indicates the
portion thereof remaining to be surveyed.
I will thank you for an immediate reply thereto.”

invidious persons might otherwise possibly take occassion to find in
my absence from Florida since September grounds upon which to
endeavor to injure me at Washington I have thought it advisable to
apprise you of the reasons of my protracted detention so much beyond
what I wished or expected. I was ready with my family a fortnight
since, but I thought I ought not to disregard a subpoena served upon
me to give evidence in an important cause in the Supreme Court of
U.S. in which I was formerly counsel and where my testimony could
not be taken properly by deposition. The case was tried the day
before yesterday in Bridgeton and I left the State the moment I was
discharged.
I will be greatly obliged to you to see that the letters sent by me to

at some other school, in his discretion. The authority required can
no doubt be readily obtained from the Chiefs, thro' Major Phagan

WILLIAM WIRT TO JAMES G. RINGGOLD
[LC:Wirt Papers, Letter Book:C]
BALTIMORE D2cember 4th 1830.
DEAR SIR. Before the conversation with you, I had rece" a letter
from Gen Call enquiring when the cases of Forbes and Arredondo
would be taken up before the Supreme Court, and expressing the
hope that they might both be tried at the same term, because being
engaged in both on the side of the Government his convenience would
be promoted by having them both tried at the same term, so as to
give him but one trip to Washington. I have answered Gen Call
that he might rely on my doing whatever was in my power to accom-
modate him; that it was not entirely certain that the Supreme Court
would take up the Causes out of their order on the docket and that
if they would not there was no likelihood of the causes being reached
at the approaching term. But that they had taken up cases where
a great number of persons were concerned in the decision and the
case of great magnitude either on account of the value of the subject,
or its operation as a precedent for the decision of other cases that I
thought it not improbable, therefore, that if both the government and
the opposite party wished the cases finally decided at this term that
it might be done—The records have not yet come up—that of Forbes
is I understand extremely voluminous. It is possible that it may not
reach us by the time of the Session of the Court; and when it does
reach us I shall require to have a copy made out that I may study the
cause for the clerk will not suffer the original to leave the Court—At
what period of the session I may be able to get such copy it is impossible
to devise-I can only say that if it be the desire of the Government
to have it tried at the approaching term no exertion shall be wanting
on my part to meet their wishes—and that if it be possible for me,
after being furnished with a copy of the record, to master the cause
in all its parts, so as to be able to do it justice, no objection to the
argument will come from me—But I cannot consent to argue causes
of so much magnitude without time to master them perfectly in all
points. To this purpose the presence of Gen Call & yourself would
* See post, p. 479.


## p. 463 (#479) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 463
greatly contribute, as you have both already argued that of Forbes—
and with such aid, if I can get my copy by the middle of the term I
have no fear of being able to do it justice before the Court rises, if
they shall consent to take it out of its turn. The embarrass-arises
from putting Gen Call to the inconvenience of coming on, in the
uncertainty of the trial. For it is uncertain whether we shall get the
record in time, & if we do, it will still be uncertain whether the Court
will take it up out of its turn. This last uncertainty might be re-
moved on the first day of the term (if the record shall then have
reach reached us) for we can move the Court to fix a day for the trial,
but then notice will have to be forwarded to Gen" Call & he would
have to come on—all which, at that season of the year, would probably
make it the last of February before he w” arive—But still if the Gov-
ernment have any particular solicitude that the causes should be
tried at this term, it w" be desirable to know it, that every step in our
power may be taken to meet their wishes—I understand Gen' Call
to have been engaged by the private claimants under the U.S. in one
of Forbes' claims & by the Government in the other, and to have been
retained also by the Government in Arrededos' case to assist in the
argument in the Supreme Court. This being the case it would be
indelicate & improper in me to propose to argue the causes in his
absence—and indeed since he has been retained (I should be unwilling
to lose the benefit of his assistance)
As you are going down to Washington, it may perhaps come in
your way in the course of conversation to know whether the Govern-
ment has any special wish on the subject of bringing on these cases
at the approaching term and whether, under the uncertainties which
I have stated, it would be deemed expedient to write to Gen'Call to
come on. M. Berrien too could say whether it be the wish of the
other side to bring on the cases.
Yours respectfully

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF PENSACOLA
AND ESCAMBIA COUNTY
[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[December 10, 1830]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress
of the United States.
The undersigned Citizens and inhabitants of the Town of Pensacola
and County of Escambia in the Western District of the Territory of
Florida most respectfully represent to Your Honorable Body that it
would be a work of supererogation to recite, or to Comment upon the
great advantages which the Port of Pensacola possesses over every
other Harbor or Bay in the Gulf of Mexico, whether regard be had
to the great depth of water on its bar; to its easiness of access; to the
Security of its Capacious Harbor; to its entire freeness from shoals,
sand banks or obstructions of any kind; to its extensive ramifications;
to the salubrity of its Climate; its Superior excellence as a watering
place; the abundance and heavy growth of live oak and other valuable
timber for Ship building, exportation and other purposes; its Com-
manding situation for the protection of the trade of the whole western
region—for which it is the only point d'appui; and in many other
respects on which it would be too tedious and irrelevant to dwell,
more expecially as the most Striking of these Caused it to be Selected
as the principal Naval Station of the South. These advantages in
the aggregate are well known to Your Honorable Body. Nature has
done for it much; very much; So much, that She has left but little for
man to accomplish; but that little renders these invaluable blessings
* See ante, p. 429, n.


## p. 465 (#481) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 465
and advantages in a great measure nugatory for the reasons which
it will be the object of this memorial to Specify
The only navigable access to the back Country of which the Port
of Pensacola is the natural emporium is by means of the Rivers
Rscambia & Conecuh; which at Certain Seasons of the Year are
obstructed by Considerable rafts of timber, and other obstacles, all
which Could be overcome and removed at a Comparatively Small
expence, but which would be too great for the individual means of
this Community. These Streams flow through the fertile Counties
Conecuh, Covington, Dale, Buttler and Pike in the State of Alabama.
The latter nearly unites with or is only divided in the upper part of
its Course by a narrow ridge from the Chocta-Hatchie or Pee River
and other Streams which empty themselves either into this, Yellow
Water or S' Rosas Bay all ramifications of the Bay of Pensacola.
Mostly all the lands Situated thereon are of the Public domain, the
Settlement of which is retarded Solely by the difficulties at Present
existing in the navigation of the said Rivers, which offer unnumerable
Sites for Saw Mills, many of which are now in operation, but from the
discouraging Circumstance of their owners only being able to float
down their Collected rafts at Certain Seasons, will Soon be abandoned
unless a remedy Can be Provided. Not less are the difficulties of
ascending the Said Rivers with the necessary Supplies for the Planta-
tions thereon or of descending with their Products, by reason of which
the agricultural and Commercial interests of the whole Community
are Seriously affected. Were it otherwise; were these obstacles
removed a new impetus would be given to the united industry of the
Country in the greatly accumulated increase of the growth of the
principal Staple of the Country, Cotton—in the great augmentation
of the quantities of Red Cedar and Staves, and of other Valuable
timber and lumber, Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Turpentine &" &” These are
a few of the Private and local advantages which would result from the
Clearing and rendering navigable these Streams, nor would they be
less important in a national Point of view, inasmuch as they would
afford increased facilities for transportation of Troops, Provisions
and military Supplies in time of war at a Small expence from the very
heart of the Country—the State of Alabama and Georgia.
When so many and Such great advantages Could be obtained at a
Comparatively inconsiderable expenditure, and having, as it were,
before us the recent proofs of the aid which Your Honorable Body
has with a wisely regulated liberality extended to other Sections of
this Territory and it being the first time that we have Solicited any
Similar aid, we now with the more Animating Confidence most
respectfully & earnestly invoke Your Honorable Body to make an

JACKSONVILLE E.F. Dec 10th 1830
SIR. The case of Fernando de la Maza Arredondo & others against
the United States instituted under the act of 23* May 1828 * for
289.645.5/7 acres of land Situated at Alachua in this District having
been decided by our Courts in favour of the claimants and an appeal
having been duly taken therein on behalf of the United States to the
Supreme Court I herewith send to your care a transcript of the record
of Said case to be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court.”
I had intended to send you the transcript open so that you could exam-
ine it before it was filed but a late rule of our Court required the Clerk
to Seal it up and direct it to the Clerk of the Supreme Court, another
copy cannot at this time be procured from our Clerk owing to a great
press of business in his office, if however another transcript of this
record is desired for your office please inform me and I will have it
made out and forwarded as soon as possible. I have been at a loss
to determine whether the provision in your late circular which the
District attorney in all cases in which a writ of error or appeal is
taken &c. to send a transcript of the record to your office accompanied
by a report of the argument in the Court below noting the points made
& authorities referred to by the respective Counsel, was intended to
embrace this class of cases or not, nevertheless I accompany this by
such report and Same therein noted the points made and the author-
ities referred by the counsel respectively—The interest of the United
States as well as of the claimants seems to require a final disposition
of the land cases taken up from the Courts of this Territory as soon
as it can be done consistently with a full and fair examination of them
80 At this point a half sheet of paper containing over twenty signatures, and
probably an endorsement, is missing.
81 Referred to the Committee on Commerce after presentation by Del. White,
Dec. 31, 1830 (House Journal, 21 Cong., 2 sess., p. 121). Referred again to the
same committee, Dec. 12, 1831 (ibid., 22 Cong., 1 sess., p. 31–32).
824 STAT. 284–286.
* The decree of the Supreme Court in favor of the claimant is found in the
published report (6 Peters, 691–759).

in the Court above, but the case of Colin Mitchel and others has been
decided by the judge of the Middle District in favour of the United
States and it is believed that many points have arisen & been decided
in that case which have also been decided in this I mention this fact
supposing that it would be desirable to the government as well as
to the Supreme Court that both of these cases (as they are very
important ones and embrace most of the points which will arise in the
various land Suits in the Territory) should be before that court before
a final decision is made in either case and as it rests with the petitioners
in that case to take the appeal and the record is very voluminous it
is more than probable that it will not be carried up in time to be acted
upon at the next term of that Court. The case of Juan Percheman
against the United States" which was instituted under the act of
26" May 1830 * entitled—“an act for the final Settlement of land
claims in Florida upon a claim for 2000 acres of land has just been
decided in favour of the claimants, as soon as I return from the
Circuit I shall prepare a Statement of the case & the evidence & of
the points of law decided by the Court in that case agreably to the
provision of the act of 23” May 1828 * an enclose it to you
In these land cases I have no taxable fees but rely upon the justice
of the President for Such “Extra compensation” as he is authorised to
make by the act last above mentioned Will you therefore be so good
as to inform me in what manner or rather by what rule that compen-
sation will be made and instruct me how I ought to make out my
accounts and what vouchers will be necessary to enable me to obtain
it.
The Suit which you directed me to institute on behalf of the Post
Master General of the United States against Squire Streeter Esqr. late
Post Master at St Augustine & his sureties upon his official bond has
been commenced.
* Concerning this case there are the following letters of 1831 from Douglas to
Virgil Maxcy: Feb. 2, enclosing a statement of the facts and points of law;
May 5, enquiring about instructions relative to an appeal; July 20, reporting
an appeal had been taken; Aug. 31, forwarding a copy of the record (NA, JD,
Sol. Treas., Lets. Recd., from Attys., Clks., U. S. Marshals, Fla.). Douglas
transmitted, Feb. 12, 1831, a copy of the brief of argument delivered in the
Superior Court, District of East Florida, in favor of Spanish grants for the use
of Wirt and Call (loc. cit.). An endorsement on the foregoing letter indicates that
the enclosure was sent to Call on Mar. 4, and a draft of the letter of transmittal
to Call is in NA (JD, Sol. Treas., Lets. Written). An acknowledgment by Maxcy
of Douglas' letter of Feb. 2, 1831, made on Feb. 26, is in the same file. See also
the long report on this case embodying the decision of the Supreme Court (7
Peters, 51–97); in which the territorial court's decision in favor of Perchman was

DELEGATE WHITE TO WILLIAM WILSON
[LC:Tallahassee, Floridian and Advocate, Jan. 6, 1831]
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14th 1830.
DEAR SIR,-I have been so much occupied since my arrival, that
I have not had time to drop you a line. At the beginning of a short
session with 250 adjourned bills on the Calendar it is impossible to
accomplish any thing of a local nature, if it is not presented in both
Houses of Congress, and pressed with all possible despatch. As we
have no representative in the Senate, my labours are doubled. I
prepare two copies of all the bills I want passed. As soon as I arrived
here, I addressed an official note to the Secretary of the Treasury,”
informing him that the claimants of the Chactawhachie grant, did
not intend to appeal, and requesting that orders might be given for
the survey of all the country west of Appalachicola, and North of
St. Andrews. An estimate has been made for an appropriation, and
instructions will be speedily given to that effect.
The final determination of that claim will remove the opposition
to any legislation upon the canal between St. Andrews and Chipola,”
an object highly interesting to the country, and desirable to the people
of Jackson. I have felt a deep solicitude on the subject of this
improvement, and shall urge it with all the influence I can raise.
There will be an increased appropriation for the removal of obstruc-
tions in Appalachicola River.”
I have also invited the attention of the Government to the necessity
of an Arsenal on the Appalachicola.”
The removal of the Indians I learn from the President will await
the decission of the Government upon the Creek negotiation.

Whave proposed amendments to the preemption law so as to embrace

I have drawn a bill for the reduction of the price of the Pine lands.”
I do not think any other will ever pass the House of Representatives.
I consider this one of the most important acts that can be passed for
Florida. My proposition is to reduct it to 50 cents, and after it has
been in market two years to 25 cents. I have handed Col. King of
the Senate, a copy of the bill, and he will introduce it in the Senate.
Two Engineers are gone to make experimental surveys on the sum-
mit level of the Florida Canal to ascertain the practicability of
obtaining water.
The House of Representatives to day “nullified” a proposition to
reduce the duty on Sugar, it would not consider the motion.
A new member will most probably be given to Madison and
Hamilton.”
I was not mistaken when I predicted that the Federal patronage of
the Government was not under the control of those who threaten
and promise in the name of the President. You have your Commission
or will soon receive it—to print the laws of the United States.”

SIR, Agreeably to your wishes "I have embraced as early an oppor-
tunity as possible of communicating with you on the subject of the
line of demarkation between the Territory of Florida and State of
Alabama, & herewith transmit for your information a plat of the
public surveys over which that line passes. The Southern termination
of the surveys made under the superintendence of the Surveyor of
public Lands in Alabama did not extend to the 31° of latitude, which
is the Southern boundary of Alabama between the Chattahootchie
and the Perdido rivers. From the correspondence, copies of which
are herewith transmitted, you will perceive that the Surveyor Gen.'

of Florida was required to survey the public lands up to the termina-
tion of Gen Coffee's surveys, in the execution of which service the
Surveyors crossed the line of the 31° of latitude, ascertained & marked
by Andrew Ellicott, as the line of demarkation of the Southern limits
of the United States, and now the boundary between the State &
Territory alluded to. In extending the surveys of Florida over the
line of the 31e of lat. the Surveyors did not retrace the line run by
Andrew Ellicott so as to enable them to exhibit on the township
plats the fractional Sections of land on each side of the line. They
only indicate that line on their surveys where they crossed the same,
or where it was identified with the line of their survey.”
It appearing to me to be the proper course of proceeding, I therefore
suggest it to you, & take leave through you to suggest the same idea
to the Alabama delegation, that this line should be retraced under
the authority of the U. States' Surveyor acting in concert with a
Surveyor to be appointed by the State of Alabama, and that it be
made the duty of the Surveyor General of Florida to connect the
line with the public surveys on both sides thereof as it is retraced, and
that if any difficulty should occur in retracing the line, the Commis-
sioners should, as occasion may require, take the latitude. This
proceeding, it appears to me, would be satisfactory to the inhabitants
of Florida residing in the vicinity of the line as well as those in Ala-
bama, by removing any doubts that now exist as to which side of the
line they reside on. It is also of importance to the respective political
and legislative jurisdictions of the State and Territory aforesaid.
The strip of land North of the 31° lat: & South of the termination
of Coffee's surveys is already made a part of the Sparta land district,
by the Act of 11" May 1820 organizing that Land district (vide Land
laws p. 775)" and I would propose that provision be made by law,
“that patents should be issued for such tracts of land sold and paid
for at the Land Office at Tallahassee in the Territory of Florida as
are found to be situate within the limits of the district of lands subject
to sale at Sparta in the State of Alabama agreeably to the terms of the
Act organizing that District.”
With the papers accompanying this communication will be found
a list of the Tracts sold at Tallahassee which are above referred to.”
I am. &c

BELEGATE WHITE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLA-
TIVE COUNCIL
[FSL:Fla. Legis. Council, Journal:M*]
WASHINGTON Decr. 26th. 1830.
To THE PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL of the Territory of
Florida.
SIRI At the last session of the Honorable body over which you
preside; a resolution, transmitted to me by its order, invited my atten-
tion to the subject of a grant supposed to have been made, or rather
indicating a wish of a preceding Council, that a grant should be made
to Richard C. Allen Esqr. for certain services in making selections
under an act of Congress, passed in 1826,” authorising the location of
two townships of land, for seminaries of learning, in our Territory.—I
am requested to make a report on the subject; at the next session to
the Council. Entertaining a profound respect for their wishes, and
feeling every disposition to co-operate with them, in the trust com-
mitted to us by our common constitutents, I shall proceed to submit,
for their consideration, a brief report.
The first act of Congress granted, for a specified object, two town-
ships land in entire bodies,” the selection of which might have been
made, without difficulty or trouble, by the Governor of the Territory,
upon whom that duty has usually developed, as a part of his Executive
Agency, in the execution of the laws of the U. States. When I
arrived here, in the station I now hold, in 1825, I ascertained that the
lands intended to be set apart by that act, had not yet been selected
and reserved, and believing that the fund for Education might be
enhanced to a value greatly exceeding that in referred to, I applied to
Congress and obtained a modification of the law, so as to allow the
unlocated land, to be selected in sections, which was granted by a
special act,'—The labour of locating, in small bodies, was certainly
increased by the new act, as much as the value of the donation; but
I do not conceive that this either rendered the employment of a
special agent necessary, or made his experiences a charge upon the fund
set a part for education. When that resolution reached here, propos-
ing to give two sections of land, for locating the remainder, it was not

considered necessary to annul it, because it was viewed as a nullity
itself, for the want of power in the Legislative Council, to legislate in
any manner upon the subject.
The first act of Congress set apart two townships of land for a special
purpose—the supplemental act did not change its provision in that
respect. It was therefore a reservation made by Congress of a portion
of the public domain for education in the Territory of Florida. The
U. States, in making the reservation, conveyed no jurisdiction to any
other Legislative Tribunal, to carry the grant into effect, or to enter-
tain jurisdiction over it.
The Governor and Legislative Council therefore had no more right,
by law or resolution, to grant away this land, than they had to grant
the U. States land or private property. It is doubtful whether the
granting authority, (Congress), could devote any portion of the
proceeds of these reserved lands, for any other than the object named
as the consideration of the Legislative grant. The resolution was
therefore considered void, by a committee of Congress, before whom
it was laid, or I should have insisted upon a law annulling it.
The execution of the laws of the U. States is entrusted by the
Constitution, to the President, and the expences of carrying them into
effect, are borne by the U. States. To obviate any difficulty arising
from a failure to make a specific appropriation, there is usually pro-
vided by Congress, a miscellaneous fund, to pay for all objects directed
by law, where there is no enumerated appropriation.
I do not consider the Territory in any wise, responsible for the
services rendered or under an obligation to make compensation for
them in land, or money—and the resolution passed first on the subject,
being void ab initio, would have remained so, without the one rescind-
ing it.
I had the subject referred to a committee at the last session of
Congress, with a statement of the agent explaining the nature &
extent of his services, and if Congress had been disposed to grant him
other lands for his services, I should have advocated any Bill for a
reasonable compensation, but according to my conceptions of the
laws for reserving the lands, I should have felt it to be my imperious
duty, to preserve them for the meritorious objects for which it was
set apart."
I have the honor to be, with high considerations of respect, Yr.
most obt. servant,
JOS. M. WHITE.
* The foregoing letter refers to the demand of Allen for extra compensation for
selecting the school townships. A Committee of Congress refused to recommend
such a grant in its report of Mar. 23, 1830 (NA, HF, Repts. Comm. on Pub.
Lands, 21 Cong., 1 sess.).

indicating in pencil a Section of Country, which you require to be

In answer I have to remark, that, my instructions from your
Predecessor prohibited the extension, South of the lands already
sectioned, my operations; arising from the fact, that all the lands
indicated by your diagram, lye within the limits of a private claim,
which is now in suit, between the claimant and the United States;
and recently at Pensacola, a Decree was had in favor of the United
States; and I presume it will be taken up by Appeal, to the Supreme
Court.
Presuming that you were unacquainted with these facts; I shall
await your further instructions on the subject, before I take any
steps, assuring you, that, if the Government no longer respects the
private claim aforesaid, that every exertion shall be used on my part,
speedily to prepare it for market. I have the honor to be &c

SIR, I have just received a letter from Samuel S. Hamilton Esq. of

to the City last winter and Spring, the subject of my orders in relations
to the eight Indian boys, which I have sent to the Indian Academy in
Kentucky," was the subject of conversation more than once–And I
am confident, the Honb" R. M. Johnson was present. I have never,
Sir, presumed to draw on any department of the Government for
any sum but by their express order and such was given in the present
instance.
I am, sure, that the whole course of your public conduct, will sustain
me in saying, that no fear of official responsibility will ever influence
you to do an act that may either injure, or reflect on the character of
an officer who has acted in Strict obedience to your instructions
I will on this occasion state to you that in the Spring 1826, I was
directed by the Department to assemble the Chiefs of the Seminole
Nation and endeavour to impress upon them, the importance of
establishing a School at the Agency for the instruction of their Chil-
dren "-In conformity with my instructions, every effort was used
to accomplish the views of the Government—The Chiefs at the
Agency after several days of consultation refused their consent to
have a school, or to educate their children"—The Chiefs on the
Appalachicola River, five in number, entertain different views, and
are exceedingly anxious to educate their youth—The eight Indian
Boys now in Kentucky are the sons of Col John Blount and other
chiefs on the Appalachicola River—They are as much entitled to the
benefit under the treaty as the Indians residing at the Agency, and
of course to a partition of the school fund—I trust therefore the draft
will be paid. I shall certainly direct the Agent, as you desire to
obtain the consent in writing of the chiefs at the Agency (as they
have no school and will not accept of one) requesting the Secretary
of War to dispose of the fund of education at such school as he may
select—The chiefs are now out hunting and it will be some time before
they can be assembled for this object, but in the meantime I consider
it but as a common act of justice to myself and the holders of the draft
that it should be paid "
I am Respectfully Your Obt. Svt.

The Road has been finished as far as the Canal which is three miles
north of New Smyrna, being under the impression that the sum of
$3,928-86 remitted to me was all that had been appropriated for that
Road I continued the repairs until the amount was expended including
the probable sum that the property purchased would bring at auction,
which I ordered to be sold previous to the receipt of your letter of the

made by act of 30" Apr: 1830 *
There yet remains three miles and a Bridge over the Canal of about
forty feet to be made which I shall have done by Contract I think it
can be done cheaper in that way than otherwise as there are a number
of persons in that part of the country engaged in cutting live oak
many of whom are Carpenters and the opening of the Road would be
much to their advantage”

claims of a Meritorious Officer, to contribute my best exertions, to
secure his reappointment.
For three years, that I have had the honor, to hold the appointment
of Judge of this District, his official conduct has of course passed
under my immediate observation, and I can with truth affirm, that
during that Entire period, the duties of his office, have been performed,
with the most undeviating, and punctilious exactness & propriety—
Whilse his official deportment, has been characterized by integrity &
firmness of purpose, as regards his duty to the Public—it has been no
less distinguished for a humane & consciencious respect for the rights

reappointment, —which from his well established character, I can
scarcely anticipate, I take the liberty of soliciting your friendly offices

SIR By last mail your letters of the 16” & 17th ultimo * were
received and the case of Alexander Love put in train for survey. The
contents of your letter of the 17th shall be fully met at the close of
the present month, at which period I expect to have seven or eight
Deputies in the East, three of whom are now engaged. The country
to which their operations will be confined you will see on the Map of
Florida, as lying North of the South boundary of the 8th Townships

South of the parallel, bounded on the West by former surveys, and
East by the Saint Johns river and Atlantic Ocean. When the con-
tracts are forwarded, a diagram shall accompany, defining as near as
practicable, the section each Deputy will occupy. In the report
you were kind enough to send me, I find a remark under the head of
“Florida” “that many private claims have been surveyed, but no
certificates have been forwarded, which ought to have been received
long since”—I hope that the delinquency was not intended to be
applied to this Office, as I claim to have complied with the Act of
Congress, on that subject & under which the Register is required to
forward certificates for data to govern the issueing of the patents.
I anticipate that the connection of the surveys heretofore made on
the Escambia river (and which have been suspended) will be completed
by the Deputies, by the close of the next month, including scapwork,
and a few private claims not surveyed previously.”

GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[Fla., Legis. Council, Journal: M*]
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE. Jan. 17th. 1831.
SIR, In the message which I had the honor to submit to the Council,
at the opening of the present session, I deemed it my duty to call
their attention to the subject of a revision of the Laws of the Territory.
Whether the adoption of measures for the revision of the statutes,
and formation of a general code, in the manner adopted by the States
of New York, Louisiana, and Virginia is deemed advisable or not, by
the Council at this time, the publication of the Laws heretofore passed,
into better shape than at present, appears tomeof sufficient importance
* In letters of Feb. 3, Mar. 17, and July 29, 1831, Butler again reported that
high waters were preventing the surveying on the Escambia (none of these letters
are in GLO files; extracts of them are printed in H. Doc. 44, 22 Cong., 2 sess."
pp. 59–60, and in A. S. P., op. cit., pp. 550-552). See post, p. 689.

to authorise my calling your attention specially to that subject.
In a communication made by the Secretary to the Council on the
15th inst.” through the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, the
making of the contracts for the publication of the laws of this Session
in news-papers and in pamphlet form, was referred entirely to the
Council. I deem it proper however to apprise the Council, that the
number of copies ordered to be published last year was insufficient
for general distribution. A number of public Officers in the counties
of Leon and Gadsden, have not been furnished, owing to the dificiency.
To enable such general distribution amongst the public officers and
citizens of the Territory, as is advisable, and also to the Executives
and Legislatures of the different States, and of the U. States, it is
necessary that at least 950 copies should be annually printed. The
publication of that number of the laws of this session, and in future,
will not however, remedy the inconvenience remitting from the
deficiency of past years. There are now in the Executive Office, but
20 copies of the laws of 1822; and about the same number of the laws
of 1823, 1824, 1826 and 1827. Of the laws of 1825, 1828 and 1829
there are but 2 complete copies, exclusive of those furnished the
Council a few days since.
It is known too that but few copies of the loose pamphlets, in
which they were published, can be had in the different counties of
this Territory. In a few years, there will be none extant. References
to the Laws passed during these years, although they may have been
repealed, is often indispensable. Disputes and litigation may arise
upon contracts formed under them, and which must be determined
by them.
Some of the repealed statutes, of those years may be revived by
re-enactment, referring to their title alone. The experience of every
state in the Union, has shown the policy, if not absolute necessity,
of collecting periodically, as experience may dictate, and embodying
and preserving, in as condensed a form as possible, the whole body of
Laws enacted by their Legislatures. I must therefore respectfully call
the attention of the Council to this subject and suggest the expediency
of publishing, in one volume, all the statutes of this Territory, since
its organization—with notes and references made by some legal
gentleman, to be appointed by the Council for that purpose, pursuing
the method adopted in the publication of the acts of Congress. I am
informed that such publication could probably be made in a Volume
of about 500 pages, including the laws of this session. In case the
Council should deem it advisable, to adopt this course, I have no
doubt that if the appropriation made last year by Congress is insuffi-

cient, to defray the expense, the General Government will not with-
hold the deficiency, upon being acquainted with the importance and
necessity of the measure. I would also respectfully recommend to the
Council, the Enactment of a law, regulating the annual publication
of the Laws and prescribing the manner of their distribution & desig-
nating to whom they shall be distributed.
The propriety and expediency, of permitting a certain number of
copies to be held annually for sale, to many persons in and out of
the Territory, who cannot otherwise obtain them, is also recom-
mended to the Council.”

have been unable to avail themselves of the Laws passed in their favor.
One Class of these are persons who were minors and till very lately
had not possession of the papers which contained their titles and were
therefore unable to lay them before the proper authorities before the
limitation of time for confirmation expired.
Another Class were non-residents who had not learned that an
opportunity existed of getting their titles confirmed. A third class
were industrious Citizens of the Territory who were until lately
ignorant that Laws had been passed in their favor.” A fourth class
are those whose grants are located on lands previously granted to
other persons without their knowledge; And a large class of citizens
who had obtained grants after the month of February January 1818
without any knowledge of the pending treaty. Most of these grants
were made for services actually rendered to the Spanish Government,
for which no restitution could be now obtained should they be de-
prived of their lands. To be removed from lands which were law-
fully obtained under a full belief that the title was perfect and after
many years of improvement for no fault of the settler would be a very
hard case and such a one as your Memorialists hope and trust the
humanity of your Hon”* Body will prevent. In full confidence of
which, your Memorialists pray that such amendments may be made
to the Land-Laws now existing, as will remedy the existing evils and
do honor to the humanity of the Nation,
And Your Memorialists will pray.

[No date, January 1831]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in

Your Memorialists Citizens of the Territory of Florida would
Humbly beg leave to Represent to your Honourable Body the peculiar
exposed condition in which We with our families and Property are
placed from our extensive and thinly Settled frontier Situation—We
would therefore Submit to your Wise and Parental Consideration the
propriety of Establishing an Arsenal at Some Eligible point in our
Territory which would in a great degree Secure to us the means of
defence in case of Invasion and for its location We know of no Situ-
ation which combines So many advantages as the Town of Ocheesee
in Jackson County it is Situated on the west bank of the Apalachacola
River and about one hundred and twenty miles by water from its
Junction with the Gulf of Mexico this River is Navigable for the
largest class of Steam boats from the Gulf to this point and from this
to Columbus in Georgia a distance of about three hundred miles by
Water for Steam Boats of a Smaller class This Site is concieved by
your Petitioners to be one among the most healthy Situations in the
Territory abounding with the finest Springs of pure Water It is at a
point the most convenient for the Transportation by Water of Arms
and all the necessary Supplies incident to Such an Establishment
It lies within a few miles of the States of Georgia and Alabama which
States are Seperated by the Chatahoochy River the main Navigable
Branch of the Apalachacola River and which States could on any
emergency be Supplied with the means of defence from a Military
Depot at this place it is Situated only twelve miles below the Junction
of the Chatahoochy and Flint Rivers the later of which is also Navi-
gable for Steam Boats as high as Bainbridge a flourishing little Town
in Georgia at a distance of about thirty five miles from the Confluence
of those Rivers & at the distance of about two miles below the Site
proposed there is a Romantic rock Bluff about one hundred feet above
as Transmitted by Turbutt R. Betton to Del. White, Jan. 28, 1831, with the
information that it came from Jackson Co. White sent it to the Secretary of
War, Feb. 12, 1831, who referred it to the Chief of Ordnance on the same date.

GADSBY's HOTEL–Thursday Morning Feby 3. 1831
DEAR SIR If my wounded limb would permit me to ride I would
go up to see you on the subject of the land claims from Florida and
Missouri which are now before the Supreme Court—and with regard
to which it is necessary that I should have some conversation with
you, before I commence the examination of these subjects—The
record in the single case of Forbes is upwards of 600 pages, folio—
besides a large pile of original documents—Arredondos, I am told, is
nearly if not quite as large—It is impossible for the clerk to make
copies of these records in time to prepare for the argument at this
term—The strong desire expressed by you in behalf of the Govern-
ment that they should now be argued, makes it necessary that some
other expedient should be adopted on this, as well as other subjects
connected with these cases, I am desirous of seeing you as soon as
convenient—The court will not now be more than five or six weeks
in session and there is no time to be lost—can you make it convenient
to give me a call in the course of the day—There are millions of acres
of the most valuable lands in Florida depending on these claims—
and there is a formidable array of counsel on the other Side—It is
therefore my desire that I may be able to argue them to the best
advantage for the Government—and that every facility sh" be
afforded to my preparation
Yours respectfuly

of those cases in the Supreme Court, and for such others as the
President might deem proper to employ assistant counsel in. That of
Soulard and one other was argued at the last term. In each of these
Mr Wirt received $1,000 which was considered by the President as a
presedent for the subsequent cases in which M. Wirt is engaged. It
is to be observed that as all these cases depend on the same principle,
the preparation for one, so far as they depend upon similarity of
principle, is a preparation for all. In this respect, the additional fee
of $1000 in each case, is deemed by the President a liberal compen-

Asst QMasters Office PENSACOLA 5* Feby 1831
GENERAL I returned yesterday from an examination of the road
contracted for, to be made in obedience to your order of the 28th
July last,” the road is now completed from Alaqua to oak hill, from
that to Mariana there is yet no direct road & the unexpended balance
$200. would fall very far short of making one that distance, 16 miles,
but having been informed when there last Oct. that a road was to be
made between those two places by the inhabitants, under the direc-
tion of the County Court, I intended to apply that balance to im-
proving it when cut out, it has not yet been done however owing (the
Judge of the Court tells me) to the neglect of the persons who were
app" to the direction of it. He says it will be made he thinks in the
course of the coming Spring
I find there are on the west side of Alaqua and near to it, two small
streams which appear to require Bridges, but which are not embraced
in my instructions they are I believe passable for horses at all times.
Nor do I think there is often if ever so much water in them as to
prevent the passage of a Carriage, but the banks near the water are
of quicksand which makes it dificult if not dangerous for a carriage
or waggon to pass in time of high water, The cost to Bridge both
would be about seventy five or eighty dollars"

ROBERT BUTLER Esq Surveyer U. S. Lands—Tallahassee—
SIR My not arriving here until 22" Ins" must be my apology for
not before noticing the reception of the documents directed to me from
your Office under date of 29* Nov. last.—
To obtain the area of the Island at low water with any degree of pre-
cision I conceive hardly probable from its locality—I meandered the
whole coast of the Island during the month of February 1829 running
the chain at ordinary high water mark and it was from my survey that
the enclosed Map was lithographed.—The supposition that it would
only be necessary for me to swear to the correctness of my survey
which I can do and furnish you with my courses and distances and a
Map, induced me to have the subject mentioned to a gentleman
through whom I expect it was made known to you.—
It is only some few parts of the Island that are much effected by the
tides, those places I have marked on the enclosed map with a pen.—
If my certifying to the correctness of my survey as I have above
stated will be sufficient, please inform me upon what scale you would
wish the Island protracted—if not, I must take the liberty to decline
making the re-survey as it will interfer with my other duties—
I shall keep the documents received from the office until I again hear
from you.-

ST: AUGUSTINE E F Feb: 11th 1831
SIR, I have the honor to inform you that I have discharged the
party engaged in repairing the Road from Jacksonville to Alachua
Court-House, having from experience found it impossible to carry on
the repairs to so many Roads at once and at such a distance from each
other, with justice to myself or the Government.
I am convinced that much time and labour has been lost through the
neglect of Superintendents, persons who must necessarily be engaged
at a per diem allowance, and whose interest is to delay the execution of
the work
My duties as Superintendent of those Roads, Qr: M. to the Post and
until very lately Asst: Commissary, have prevented me from visiting
the parties engaged on the different Roads as often as I wished, or as I
have found absolutely necessary, in addition to which I have found it
extremely difficult to procure a sufficient number of labourers for so
uncertain and limitted a period without giving a most exorbitant price,
at one time I could have employed 150 labourers on the different
Roads to advantage, whereas I could not procure more than one fourth

of the number which has occasioned much delay independent of other
causes. I would therefore respectfully suggest to you the expediency
of applying the appropriations either by public Contract or to direct
me to superintend in person
In order to avoid any delay in case you should order the Road to be
done by contract, I have given notice that proposals will be received to
complete the remainder of the Road. I do not think the appropri-
ation sufficient to repair the whole route, for the country is very low
and requires a great deal of ditching, but 40 miles of this Road runs in
the Road from Tampa Bay to Colerain for which there is an appropri-
ation, if that part of it can be repaired from that appropriation the
balance may possibly be made, the appropriation was in the first
instance altogether insufficient to make the necessary repairs

thousand dollars for surveys of Roads and Canals none of which, it is
believed, has ever been expended in the Territory of Florida; and as
the only Surveys ever made, have not been by the direction of the
President, (who has by law the power, to dispose of that appropria-
tion); but under special laws of the United States; and as this Legisla-
tive Council entertain the opinion, that there are works of Internal
improvement in this Territory of essential interest to its inhabitants
and connected with great national improvements in which the Western
and south-western states are deeply concerned; in which no Constitu-
tional question can be presented, the advantages of which have been
disclosed in addresses and letters to committees of Congress and their
reports thereon.
Be it therefore resolved, That the President be and he is hereby

cost presented, of Canals to connect Mobile and Pensacola Bays, and
thence persuing a line along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico
between Choctawhachie Bay and river and the West arm of St Andrews
Bay and from the East side of St Andrews to Chipola river, and to the

cation for the conveyance of the products of the Mississippi to the
various points on the northern Coast of the said Gulf of Mexico.”

and estimate of a Canal from St Mary's river by St Augustine and
through the intervening sections of land to form a continous naviga-

“Whereas it is represented to this Legislative Council of the Terri-

Be it therefore resolved, That our Delegate in Congress be requested

through ignorance of the Laws, or other circumstances, have omitted
to file their claims before the late Board, for the settlement of land
claims, to file the same before the Superior court of said district, or

HON THOMAS F. FOSTER House of Rep"
The proposition to change the line of stages lately established from
Pensacola to Talahassee so as to run from Mount Vernon at the
mouth of Flint River to Bainbridge and there terminate would be
highly displeasing to the inhabitants of Pensacola and Talahassee
and much more expence to the Department than at present
It is the first and only stage route ever established entirely within
the bounds of Florida and to divert this to a terminating point in
Georgia would not give satisfaction though ther might be another
route crossing that point to Talahassee and the proprietors of the
line if not permitted to carry the passengers to Talahassee or if re-
quired to increase their distance to do so, would consider it a loss.
for which they would justly claim indemnity from the department.
It would be more eligable to establish a distinct route from Mount
Vernon to Bainbridge which if the law would autherize it would give
the Post Master General pleasure to do. As it now is if any person will
transport a weekly mail from Mount Vernon to Bainbridge a distance
I should suppose of less than 30 miles for the proceeds of the office of
offices which would be established on it. The Post Master General
will willingly establish the route, but he is not autherized to incur a
quarter expence when the route is not laid down by law "

thereof—The Township plat returned must have been put up in

In answer to your inquiry whether Paul M“Cormick has not been
paid for lines run by Boyd or M'Neil in 1825, I have made the neces-
sary examination; and assure you that no payment has been made
of the kind alluded to—When the accounts of M* M*Cormick were

correctness—I have long since established the rule of with-holding
payment for all parts of lines when connection is not formed to enable
this Office to cast the contents, and the present case, was of that
character having small pieces of lines, unconnected and which have
been run entire by the late Survey—Due attention shall be given to
your instructions on the subject of forwarding field notes of all
traverse work hereafter made—
I have been recently informed that the claimants to the tract of
land West of the Appalachicola river, (which you directed me to
have Surveyed as p" diagram sent me) have declined taking an appeal
to the Supreme Court, and I have therefore deemed it my duty to
proceed to the Survey of the same under y' instructions, and for
which purpose I have forwarded contracts to be signed by two Dep”
Surveyors now in the West and dispatched hence a third, with the
necessary instructions on that head. When the contracts shall have
been returned they will be forwarded, together with two others;
without delay and in the mean time I here subjoin a list of the names
and number of miles to each Deputy, with a view that I may be fur-
nished with the funds to meet the same in due time One of the

into my hands, at the session before the last, I presented them from a
sense of indispensible official obligation, disclaiming all knowledge of
the facts stated, and desiring not to be connected with, or responsible
for any thing communicated. I had no knowledge of the transactions
which were made the subject of the memorial to the President, and
from a most sincere and unaffected desire, to avoid the remotest con-
nection with it, I did not wish to make myself even acquainted with
them. I supposed of course, that when accusations, so seriously
affecting the character of a public officer were preferred to the con-
stitutional authority to make the examination, and apply the cor-
rective, that the party accused, if innocent, would be the first to
demand the strictest scrutiny and minutest investigation.”
The right of a citizen to present his petition, was one of so unques-
tionable, and impervative a character that I could have no hesitation
as to my duty, to lay it before the Executive and leave it to such order
as he might think proper to take on the subject.—Governor Duval
instead of meeting these complaints, in that manly spirit which in-
nocence always displays, shrunk from investigation, and loaded the
petitioner with every species of vituperation and abuse. It appeared
to me that his character or motives, had nothing to do with the merits
of the question referred to the President. The truth of the charges
was the important inquiry to the government, and the citizens. From
the course that this thing has taken, however, one would be induced
to think that the prosecutor himself was on trial, and the Governor
and his friends his accusers. Strange and extraordinary as this pro-

ceeding appeared to me, I was still reluctant even to look into the
charges and evidence, from the unalterable disgust with which I
recoil from all private or public controversies. Finding myself how-
ever assailed with utmost intolerance for this simple act of public
duty, in presenting a petition of the contents of which I had no knowl-
edge, and never encouraged, having my suspicions excited, too, from
the attempt to put down injury by abuse, and denunciation, I pledged
myself to demand an investigation. The course of Gov. Duval had
called forth my letter of the 30th of October last, a copy of which is
herewith enclosed,” and having thus vindicated myself from his un-
provoked attacks, I was still unwilling to enter into a controversy be-
tween him, and Mr Wyatt. I made a polite request of the President
to order an investigation into the alledged abuses in the disbursements
of the pulic funds, and was told that the memorial was disposed of
without affording the petitioner an opportunity for proof, and that it
could not be touched or re-examined without new charges which,
when made should be referred, to a special agent to examine them.
They were again presented with various additional allegations of op-
pression, embezzlement, and mal-administration—and upon this I
only asked an investigation. I was requested by the Secretary to call
upon the President, who advised me to reconsider the subject or to
make out charges myself, as the most unfavourable representations
were made of the character of Mr. Wyatt. I then determined so far
as it depended on me, no officer of the government of any rank, should
evade charges affecting the reputation of the Territory, I represent
by groundless imputations upon the character of the individual pre-
senting them. I then addressed to the Pres’t. the letter bearing date
the 24 of Feb. last.” I was told that the Pres’t. had ordered an
examination of the records and found that they furnished no evidence
of any impropriety in the charges, and as he did me the favor to
exhibit to me the representations on the part of the Gov. I determined
to withdraw the papers with a view of giving to them a nearer exami-
nation, and if I found that the slightest injustice was likely to be done
to the Governor, or if the charges were contradicted by the records
never to present them again. I regret to say that I cannot bring my
mind to the conclusion to which the President seemed to have arrived,
and with the greatest possible respect I beg leave to suggest, that if
the President will take time to read the papers submitted, he will see
that there has been a double charge as alledged.
The paper marked (B) is the original account of Governor Duval
paid by Col. Walton up to the 31st December 1825.” The papers

from the Department (F) shew that for a part of the same time the
Governor charged and received the rent from the United States. The
account of Col. Walton is rendered afterwards with this voucher and
the allowance refused because the Governor had already been paid by
the United States. It cannot be denied that he was paid by Col.
Walton and by the United States for the same rent, and Col. Walton
is made the debtor of the Government, because of the double payment
of the Governor. If there is truth in the records of the Treasury, in
the Report of the Auditor and the original receipt of the Governor,
this charge is sustained.
In relation to these accounts without going into details, the fact is
unquestionable, that the Governor not only expended the customary
sum appropriated for contingences, but actually had accounts audited
in one year requiring an increase of appropriation to three times the
usual sum.
If it be true that stationary to the amount of $240 62% cents was
furnished for the Executive Office in 1828, in adition to that furnished
to the Legislative Council, it must at least be considered a most
extravagant allowance. .
I was told too that the office had been examined and there was
nothing to be found on the subject of the excessive and improper
charge for furnishing corn for the Indians. The charge as I under-
stand it, is that Samuel Y. Garey offered to furnish the corn to the
perishing Indians at a more convenient place for them at 70 or 75
cents per Bushel, and that Major Chaires offered to take the contract
at one dollar per Bushel, and that the Governor gave the contract to
M. Crupper at $225 per Bushel to be delivered at Tampa Bay. The
latter fact may be ascertained by an inspection of the records of the
War Department.”
The other however, which is the important matter, can only be
established by the evidence of Messrs. Garey and Chaires. I know
that when I was at the Agency in May 1827, some rotten corn was
hauled from Tampa Bay to that place, at an expense equal to the
offer of Mr Garey, for the transportion alone, and I think no human
being could have lived upon it, such was its state of deterioration.
This miserable and decayed material had undergone that process in
transportation which renders it unfit even for horses. Col. Brooke
had not long before informed the Government that the Indians were
perishing from starvation, and Congress made this appropriation to
relieve them from the most afflicting misery. If it be true that the
bounty of the Government was thus wasted to fill the pockets of a
favourite merchant, to whom the Governor was indebted, it deserves
"See ante, vol. XXII, 940, n.

it would seem to me a little more consideration than a passing de-
Inunciation on the person making the accusation. All these charges
are not made by Mr. Wyatt alone, but by various other persons, and
among others Col. Humphries, late Indian agent, against whose per-
sonal integrity, and private worth I am not aware that any thing can
be said.
The President did me the honour to exhibit to me a letter of Gover-
nor Duval, to his private Secretary, which although marked “private”
he perceived was intended for public effect, and in the frankness of
his character, not wishing to countenance concealed attacks, he
handed it to me for my perusal.
Without that letter you would have been most probably spared the
trouble of reading this. A man who is under no necessity of conceal-
ment, and whose conduct can bear the test of scrutiny, does not write
abusive letters marked “private” to have a public influence. This
letter set out with giving an account of the circulation of a petition
by Mr. Kingsley of East Florida, which petition the Governor says
was drawn by myself. The charge is without the slighest foundation
in truth, and the Governor knew it to be false when he made the
suggestion. Mr. Kingsley is a classical scholar, who would consider
it a degradation to be put on a footing with Governor Duval in point
of intellect, or education. This gentleman has a large property in the
Territory and exercising the right of a citizen, had written a respectful
petition to the President, praying that some other person should be
appointed Governor.
For this flagrant offence, the letter in question was written indicating
the most intolerant spirit and going into the private history and alled-
ged vices of the petitioner, in so coarse and gross a manner as not
to allow a repetition here. The Governor then proceeds to give an
account of the prodigious excitement of the people the seizure of the
paper by force, the bon-fire, and the threatened destruction of the
petitioner and his timely and energetic interference, to prevent per-
sonal violence, and the consequent apology of the writer to save him-
self from destruction. The whole story, I am assured by the most
respectable gentlemen, is untrue, and the account of it is a libel on
the people of East Florida. They are not such Bullies and Black-
guards as the account would induce one to think, but a quiet, orderly,
and respectable population. The manner in which the petition was
obtained from Mr. Kingsley is disclosed in his letter which accom-
panies this paper and in which he encloses a second petition to the
President. If a respectable gentleman cannot petition for a redress
of grievances without such assaults upon his private character, we are
under the dominion of our provincial Satrap, in a worse condition

than we were under the Spanish Government. The Governor pro-
ceeds to inform the Secretary that “White is down!” and will be
beaten ten to one, and if the President would order him to Washington
he would put his (White's) character before the nation in an odious
light. This sentiment alone in my humble judgement ought to cause
his dismission from office. He consults his wishes rather than his
judgement in announcing the first fact, that I am down and whether
I am to be beaten or not, is a question for the people to decide.
How impertinent to suppose that the President would order him
here to traduce me!!! When he speaks of being ordered here, I
understand from some acquaintance with his former habits, that he
desires to be ordered on public business so that his expenses may be
paid, while the avowed object is to place me before the nation in an
odious light. So late as February 1829 in a letter to me, he speaks
with great indignation of the calumnies against me, does not “credit
a word of them,” and expresses his regard for me. I am not aware
of any offence since that time, and must conclude that he expected
that such a letter would never reach my eye.
The President also, exhibited to me a letter of R. C. Allen Esqr. to
Judge White" of the Senate and another of one Crane to whom the
Cognomen of Judge is attached, but being one of the Governor's
puisne Judges, it is no evidence of either character, or capacity. Mr.
Allen sets out with a rapturous description of our “beloved Governor”
charges me and my “man Wyatt” with arranging a plan of attack
&c., all of which I deny. Mr. Allen has chosen to call in question
my motives in an alledged combination against his “beloved Gov-
ernor,” and if I were disposed to return the compliment I might say
that he was the same person who was appointed to select the lands
for the Seminary of learning, by the Governor, and in whose favour
a Resolution was passed, making an illegal and unauthorized appro-
priation of two sections of land worth ten thousand dollars from those
reserved for education, which a subsequent Legislative Council an-
nulled—of Judge Crane; I have not a word to say further than to
refer to the reports in the Treasury, in certain smuggling cases tried
at Tallahassee a year or two since. It would be quite as charitable
in me to ascribe the support of these individuals to the benefit they
have received from the mal-administration of Governor Duval, as it
is for them to accuse me of combination against their “beloved Gov-
ernor.” Mr. Allen tells Judge White that the opposition is confined
to dismissed officers and Northern men. The opinion of a large por-
tion of the people of Florida, is that the support given to the Gover-
nor is in a great measure confined to those who hold his commission,

have been benefitted by his favoritism, or are his creditors and en-
dorsers who desire to retain him to indemnify themselves from the
Treasury. I feel myself constrained to repel the idea so industriously
circulated of the infamy of Mr. Wyatts character. It is due to my-
self as well as to him, as the object is to lessen the weight of my
reputation by connecting me with a man represented as infamous.
Mr. Wyatt is an active political opponent who has always been
heretofore against me, in local elections, and in the heat of the canvass
I have spoken harshly of him. But I never knew any fact of his
conduct that would justify his being denounced as infamous, and I
know he was supported for the Legislative Council by many of those
whose interest it is now to abuse him. In his private relations he
has the character of an honest man, his public conduct has been such
as to secure him an election in the largest District of the Territory
as long as he was a candidate, and he received more votes for Con-
gress, in the county in which he (and Gov. Duval) lives, than Col.
Gadsden and myself together.
In intellect manners and education he is superior to the Governor.
His complaints cannot be disregarded upon any undefined imputa-
tion of infamy.
I have the honour now to inclose numerous memorials, and a new
catalogue of charges, which I pray may be placed on file, and if they
should not be deemed sufficient to prevent the appointment of the
Governor, or to induce an investigation, they shall be supported by
proof before the meeting of the Senate.”

SIR. The claim of John Forbes & C° to a large tract of country
situated between the Chocktawhatchy and Appalachicola Rivers in
Florida, having been rejected, and no appeal having been taken
within the time prescribed by law, the decree of the Court below has
become final, and the land covered by the claim, is now subject to

position of this tract on the map will impress you with the importance
of having it surveyed and brought in to market as early as practicable.
In the Eastern part of the Territory I would respectfully suggest
the propriety of extending the surveys down the Peninsula as far as
the Indian boundary. You will perceive from the treaty with the
Florida Indians that they are located on the Peninsula, with a reser-
vation to the Government of all the land on the Seaboard for the
distance of fifteen miles, both on the Gulf and the Atlantic border.
Some of these lands are said to be valuable both on account of the
fertility of the soil and the Live Oak forests with which they are
covered. On the Western Margin there are two excellent Ports the
Bay of Tampa, and Charlotte Harbour, at beth each of which settle-
ments have been formed. The latter is a place of rendevous for the
Spanish fisher men of Cuba, who keep up a regular intercourse between
that place and Havanna. It is important that the lands along the
margin of the Gulph should be disposed of as early as possible. But
far the present it would be perhaps most prudent merely to have the
country run off in townships, by which means the character of the
lands would be developed and wherever they may be found sufficiently
valuable to warrant the expense they can afterwards be divided in to
sections and sold.

SIR. The duties I engaged to perform in the two cases of John
Forbes & C° and Arredondo & Son lately depending in the Superior
Court of Florida have been performed.

Forbes & C° East of the Appalachicola River included in that suit
the claim of Panton Leslie & C° for a still larger tract of land, the
grant to which presented many principles different from that involved
in the grant to John Forbes & C° and the two cases thus united gave
me almost as much trouble as though they formed two different ac-
tions. The printed Record in the case containing 736 pages will
give you some idea of the labour I performed in the Court below.
The case of John Forbes & C° West of the Appalachicola was argued
at Pensacola. I was compelled to go there to attend to it at the most
unpleasant season of the year. It cost me two months absence
from home, and an expenditure equal to one half the compensation I
rec" for the service. My success was such as to put the case finally
to rest, no appeal having been taken from the decision below. Under
these circumstances I think I should be allowed an additional sum
of $500.
My stage fair and travelling expences in coming to this place and
returning home will amount to $225 which I think should be allowed
me, as I came contrary to my own judgment, and under the special
instructions of the Government.
The case of Robinson & another against the Register and Receiver at
Tallahassee was argued twice by me before Judge Woodward who
granted the Mandamus, and twice before the Court of Appeals in
Florida. There are besides ten or twelve cases below which await
the decision of this, most of which I argued below. The government
having paid Col Allen for a part of those services I shall charge but
$150 for mine.
Should you approve of the several charges I have made you will
please give the necessary orders for their payment, as I am desirious
to leave this early the next week.

you will find the strongest testimonials from every County in East
Florida, of the just and faithful manner, in which I have uniformly
discharged my official duties, and of the favorable estimation in
which I am held throughout the District.”
You will also find, that those who most unjustly complained against
me in 1829, have become sensible that they were wrong, and now
disavow all cause of complaint, or express their regret that they made
it."—and I am much mistaken or your generous feelings will be
roused to something like indignation, when you perceive from these
documents, the impositions practised, and even the attempt at
bribery, in getting up the memorial against me.
I thank God, that subsequently better feelings prevailed, and that
a sense of truth, or the force of public sentiment in East Florida,
has compelled the memorialists to retrace their steps, or at least to
desist from the course of injustice attempted against me.
I will detain you Sir, no longer than to say, that since the dismissal
of their complaint by the Judiciary Committee, in addition to what
was then before them, (in my justification) there have been filed in
the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, as the anti-
dote to the poison, numerous documents and testimonials, derived
not only from the most respectable disinterested sources, but from
the declarations, even from the mouths of the complainants them-
selves, completely contradicting, or justifying me, as to every al-
leged accusation or implication contained in their complaint—and
proving too, the entire, I may say, at this time, the undivided and
unequivocal approbation bestowed upon me, and upon my official
conduct, by the whole people of East Florida.
I have only submitted copies of some few of these documents, be-
ing unwilling to trouble you with more. If they do away unfavorable
impressions—if they prove to you, that I merit your good opinion, I
shall indeed be thankful—and I cannot but beleive Sir, that to your
benevolent mind, it will be a pleasure to learn, that I have been mis-
represented—and to find one, who even from his childhood has been
an ardent though an humble friend to his Country—who has rejoiced
in the glory that your deeds have shed upon her fame, and who, from
his very heart, has ever been a supporter of all her Republican
institutions, not unworthy of your approbation.
I have Sir with sincere respect truly yours,

Note—I fear that General Jackson, has not condescended to read
this letter, nor the documents sent with it—otherwise it is impossible,
that his mind, governed by just principles, and open to the influences
of truth and evidence, should not have exonerated me from every
unfavorable impression produced by a repudiated disowned and dis-
proved complaint—nay, should not have esteemed and applauded

Alas! in my case, that Falsehood, with Giant Stride, should have

had be estimated and asked for by the Secretary of War and that
the same had been at the last session of congress meet by an appro-

business—as the officers and persons employed are complaing of not
having received their several allowances for the reasons as stated–I

no objection on the part of the Secretary of War, it would be rending
me a service by transmitting the amount to me with such arrears as
are now due to the other officers My private affairs demand my
attention in Kentucky, and if the Secretary of War does not deem

SIR. The accompanying account for $208.75 in Favour of E. B
Gould Esq" you will notice is properly payable out of the appropriation
for this Territory of 1830." It appears however by your Communi-
cations to the payees of some accounts recently certified by the
Governor, that this appropriation has been expended and by the last
appropriation law, it seems the sum appropriated in 1830 was in-
sufficient to meet the expenses of 1829 which it was intended to pay,
in as much as it is Stated in the last act that $248 of the amount then
appropriated is arrearages." Whether this was to meet some par-
ticular account certified to the department before the law or whether
it was predicated upon an estimate (including this account) made by
the Governor. I do not possess certain information. If the latter
be the Case this account can of course be paid without difficulty, and
if not, should there be any excess of the appropriation of this year
unexpended it is presumed it can be paid out of such excess, as far as
it goes. If not or if the excess should be insufficient to pay the full
amount, it will be necessary to provide for its payment in the appro-
priation of next Year.

I hope you will place me in possession of that amount as soon as

I have again to report the entire impracticability of having the

waters which have been up for twelve months past, I again repeat
that there are two Deputy Surveyors under standing orders to com-
plete these Surveys with some others unfinished; whenever the waters

[No date, June 1831]
TO THE HON° SAM" D. INGHAM
Your Memorialists Citizens of the Town of Apalachicola in the
Territory of Florida beg leave to State, that in Compliance with their
petition, Congress passed a law at the last Session, appropriating,
Eleven Thousand four Hundred Dollars for the erection of a light
house at the West End of St George's Island. and Four Hundred
Dollars, for placing Buoys in the Sound of St George.” In pursuance
thereto, the fifth Auditor, directed the Collector of the Customs at
St Marks, to locate Said light house & Buoys,” under the impression,
that the duty, Could from his vicinity, be more conveniently performed
by him than any other Collector on the gulf. This Error on the part
of the fifth Auditor, was promptly corrected, he was informed by the
Collector at Magnolia, that there was a Collector at Apalachicola,
and of Course, the duty more properly belonged to him.” Not-
withstanding these facts and circumstances, the fifth Auditor repeats
his instructions and a Collector of an adjacent District who is an utter
Stranger to the Coast and who has never visited the port of Apalachi-
cola, is ordered on the important Duty of Locating our Light House
and Buoys.”
Your Memorialists would therefore request that Capt Swiler of the
revenue Cutter Pulaski, be ordered on this Service in Conjunction
with the Collector of this District, who we are Satisfied possesses
every information which the duty requires–

[NA:GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE 1* July 1831
SIR I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the circular
of the Secretary of the Treasury under date of the 1" of May” which
among other things provides that the Receivers shall be allowed as
a compensation for their “expences and labour” twelve and a half
cents per mile for every mile travelled from their respective offices
to the Bank of deposit and returning. And for their “risk” in making
such deposit the one hundredth part of one per cent on the amount
for every ten miles of distance from the land office to the place of
deposit by the nearest route. I am required to make my deposites
at Mobile, when ever the Sum on hand shall exceed $10,000 and al-
ways at the end of three months however small the amount may be.
The distance to Mobile, by the nearest mail route is 407 miles. The
--"
* Floyd was informed that the superintendence of the lighthouse and buoys
was transferred to him, and he was instructed to purchase a site on St. George's
Island and to procure and place buoys (NA, TD, ST Lighthouse Lets., Bk. 8).
The transfer was explained in the letter to Willis (loc. cit.).

per centage allowed on $10,000 is about $40 and the milage about
$101.75. Making the entire allowance for the “risk, labour and
expences” in depositing $10,000, at Mobile is $141.75.
The Stage fare from this to Mobile and returning is $81.40. The
Stage arrives and departs but once a week. The expences in trav-
elling is about $2 per day, and it requires about 20 days to go and
return. Making the expences alone including stage fare $121.40.
This deducted from $141.75 the whole amount allowed, leaves a
balance of $20.35 as a compensation for the “risk” and “labour”.
The duties of the Receiver require his presence at his office, and it
therefore becomes necessary for him to employ a carryer to make
his deposits for him and a man who is worthy to be intrusted with
$10,000 can rarely be employed here to go to Mobile for less than
five dollars per day, besides his expences. This for 20 days would
amount to $100, which added to the travelling expences, and Stage
fare would be $221.40. Thus the expences of every deposit would
bring the Receiver in debt $80.25, a Sum nearly equal to his entire
compensation for receiving, and becoming responsible for $10,000.
This Sir was certainly not the intention of Congress when it provided
by the Act of the 22" of May 1826, that the Receiver should be
allowed a reasonable compensation for the teet:ble “risk labour and
expences” in making deposits of the public money.” It must be
known to the department that there are no officers of the Govern-
ment so badly compensated for their services as the Receivers of
Public money. They are entitled to a salary of $500 per year, and
a Commission of one per cent for the money expended or deposited
by them. They furnish there own Clerks and Offices. My Clerk
hire has never been less than the amount of my Salary. I have an
office of my own, which saves me the expence of renting one, were it
not for this I should be compelled to pay from fifteen to twenty
dollars per month for one. The Act of Congress of the 22" of May
1826 was intended to increase the compensation of those officers and
it has thiess vested in the Treasury department a descretionary power
to give them what they may justly be entitled to receive for there
Services. Believing that neither the Spirit or letter of the law has
requires the restrictions imposed by the late regulations, I decline
accepting the compensation provided. I shall rigidly observe those
regulations so far as they relate to my duties in making deposits of
the public money, and I shall expect hereafter to receive such reason-
able compensation as the law has provided, for my expences risk and
labour. The former allowance was truly in adiquate, but I prefer
it to the present, as the additional per centage would enable me to

It will be seen from the above that the Inspectors of elections, with
few exceptions, have transmitted to the Executive, either the Poll
Book or a transcript from it. And why did they do this? Because
they felt convinced that the law requires them so to do. No one can
doubt but that they would have dispensed with it if they had thought
that without it their returns would have been legal, and would be
received by the Executive. This general concurrence of the Inspec-
tors, shows the view taken of the law by them. In the cases where

JOHN L'ENGLE TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File: ALS]
ST. AUGUSTINE E F July 12th 1831
SIR I have the honor to transmit to you my accounts of the 2"
Quarter for the Old Kings, Tallahassee and Colerain Roads
Mr. Griswold has not finished the repairs to the Old Kings Road
agreeable to his Contract,” but has assured me that it will be com-
pleted before the expiration of this month
The appropriation for repairing the Road from Jacksonville to
Alachua Court-House is expended, my Accounts will be forwarded as
soon as I can procure receipts from individuals at present absent.
The Road has been repaired to within two miles of Black Creek a
distance of twenty five miles from Jacksonville That portion of the
Road between Black Creek and the Court-House has not been re-
paired, I estimate the distance at fifty-five miles and judge that
$2,000 will be sufficient to put it in suitable repair it passes over a
more elevated section of country and will require less labour
The Old Kings Road will no doubt be completed by the receipt of
this letter I shall then have finished the duties assigned to me at this
station and await your further instructions. If it should not be
inconsistent with the arrangements of the Department I would
respectfully solicit the favor of being assigned to the Station at
Charleston—I believe there is no Asst: Q Master there *
I am very respectfully Your Obdt: Servt:
JOHN LENGLE Lt: Asst: Q Master
MAJOR GEN: THO"S JESUP Quarter Master General Washington
* The law stipulated that official returns should be made to the governor
within two months (Fla. Acts, 1828, pp. 248–253). Based on the incomplete
returns Governor DuVal declared the election a tie and on July 2, 1831, pro-
claimed a new election for the first Monday in Oct. (Tallahassee Fla. Courier,
July 31, 1831, LC, Records of States of the U. S., E 3). Apparently this election
was not held. A packet of papers in NA (HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.) gives White's
side of the case. Gadsden wrote to DuVal, Feb. 3, 1832 (NA, SF, 22 Cong.,
1 sess.), expressing a belief that there had been negligence and irregularities in
the election and enclosing documents to support his claim, although previously
he had conceded the contest to White and applied to the President for public
employment, June 11, 1831 (LC, Jackson Papers, Vol. 78). Subsequently he
served as United States Minister to Mexico, and in that capacity negotiated the
Gadsden Purchase. Cf. ante, vol. XXII, 41, n. See post, p. 695.

TALLAHASSEE Thursday night July 21*1831
GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON President of the United States.
SIR I wrote to you this morning on the subject of appointing
Maj Romeo Lewis as Marshall for the Middle District of Florida *—
several of the citizens for have this moment called on me with a
request that I would write to you and enclose in my letter, the recom-
mendation herewith transmitted-I beg leave to state to you that
by our local laws allmost all the important duties, which are in the
States assigned to Sherriffs—are given to the united States Mar-
shalls—nor could Maj Lewis have made any thing by the office of
sherriff but for his station as Duputy under the late Marshall
I did not know that any recommendation in favour of Maj Lewis
had been thought of, when I wrote to you this morning, and I am
gratified to observe that our citizens have all express—the same opinion
of nim. If the mail did not close to night, and we had three days
longer, to obtain a further recommendation, I am confident that a
thousand signers—would be pleased to add their names—
Owing to circumstances Maj Lewis has advanced the late Marshall
several considerable sums of Money—and if he should loosse them his
profits as the Deputy marshall will not by any means cover the
loss *—
Col" Butler would have gladly written to you in favour of Maj
Lewis, but I regret to add he is very unwell & confined at home—I
hope his indisposition is not, serious—although I am informed to night
he is worse than he has been since he was taken down. Genl. Call is
absent at St Augustine or he would have written,—Col" James
Gadsden will warmly recommend Majr. Lewis—I hope you will give
him the appointment so anxiously desired by your immediate friends
and the people *
I am Respectfully Your obt sevt

The undersigned, Citizens of Tallahassee, beg leave respectfully to
represent to the President of the United States, the claims which they
Concieve Maj. Romio Lewis has to the appointment of Marshal for
the Middle District of Florida to fill the vacancy occasioned by the
death of Maj Alexander Adair the late Marshall. Maj Lewis has
discharged the duties of Sherriff of Leon County for the last five or
Six years, and at the last election of Sherriff received almost a unani-
mous vote over his Competitor. When Maj" Adair received the
appointment of Marshall of this district, he appointed Maj Lewis his
deputy, who discharged the duties of the office untill Maj. Adair
arived in the Territory, and Continued to discharge the duties as his
Deputy untill his death, with general Satisfaction. We believe we are
fully authorized to Say that the appointment of Maj Lewis Will be
more acceptable to the people of the district than any other man—
as an Officer, he is Prompt, vigilent and efficient, and as a Man,
responsible, worthy and highly esteemed by all Who know him—We
therefore respectfully, but ernestly Solicit his appointment *

GEN CHARLES GRATIOT Chief Engineer
The undersigned Merchants of the Town of Magnolia on the St
Marks River, Florida, are greatly interested in the removeal of the
obstructions in the river and harbour of St Marks.
They earnestly request that an Engineer be sent for that purpose,
as they have no confidence either in the capasity or responsability of
the present Agent Mr Willis, they consider him unfit in evry respect
for a trust of this kind, he is no engineer either in theory or practise.
It is more than twelve months since he has had this appointment
and although a large amount of the appropriation (as we believe) has
been expended, nothing effectual has been done toward effecting the
objects thier is not the least probability of his succeeding in removing
the obstructions, and we have reason to fear, that unless some com-
petent Engineer be sent the money will all be expended for nothing.
It would be a gratification to know the amount of money already
expended by the present Agent as we are apprehensive that a large
amount has been squandered away.
We refer you to our Delegate Colo Joseph M. White who is person-
ally acquainted with us, for the degree of credit to be plased in our
statements, and would most anxiously request that no more of the
appropriation be paid to the present Agent until an enquiry be mad,
how, it is to be be expended."

WASHINGTON Sept. 8, 1831
SIR, Allow me to Submit for your consideration a brief Statement
of facts relative to the conduct and capacity of Several public func-
tionaries at Pensacola-
Of Mr. Wright the District Attorney I shall speak only as it re-
gards his conduct in the trial of a Spaniard charged with the murder
of Pearle, a Sailor belonging to the U. S. Ship Natchez, When ear-
nestly Solicited to prosecute this trial he declined—rendering as an
excuse that the accused was a Spaniard of considerable influence
among the creoles—that he himself was a candidate for popular
favour and he Should not prejudice himself in the estimation of the
Spanish part of the population on account of a worthless Sailor.
Being threatened with a representation of his conduct at Washing-
ton, he reluctantly consented to Serve, but positively refused having
any legal gentleman associated with him. At the trial a picked
Jury appeared—consisting of eleven Spaniards and one American,
and Six out of the twelve, were accomplices in the tragical affair
which resulted in the death of Pearle. Mr. Wright was requested
to challange Several of the Jury—he at first refused, but at length
challenged one. In the course of the trial Mr. Wright So far from
manifesting a becoming fidelity and activity in eliciting & arranging
testimony calculated to cast light on the bloody affair, evinced a
Supineness and indifference that filled every honest mind with
amasement:-Indeed he virtually abandoned the case:-For the
truth of this Severe declaration I refer to Judge Breckenridge who
presided on the trial. Mr. Wright is regarded at Pensacola as a man
as Willis, who was informed by Del. White of the petition against him, ex-
pressed a readiness to have an inspection made of his operations, Oct. 25, 1831

of feeble abilities, small legal attainments, and utterly incompetent
even when rightly disposed to discharge in a becoming manner the
duties of his Station as District attorney."
Mr. Caro of Pensacola is keeper of the Public Archives, and is
also a civil Magistrate.—In this capacity he was called upon to issue
a warrant for the apprehension of the Individual who has been iden-
tified as the murderer of Pearle. He refused, & when remonstrated
with went to the proper Source and resigned his Magistracy—but
after the trial was over he solicited & obtained again his office as
Magistrate. His motives for this conduct may be found in the cir-
cumstance that he was at this time a candidate for the Mayoralty of
Pensacola and taking any part in a process affecting the character of
a Spaniard he apprehended might diminish his popularity with the
creoles;—Whether Such a person is worthy of holding an office of
trust and emolument under the general government is a question for
others to decide.
Mr. Lareur"—the Post Master at Pensacola is a constant fre-
quenter of a farro bank, where he has Suffered losses to Such amount
that he is now generally regarded as a Bankrupt. He is Seldom seen
at the Post office. He farms out this office to a young Spaniard who
has but a very imperfect knowledge of the english language—who is
negligent of his business, who is of a depraved moral character, who
visits the farro bank, and who if public opinion may be quoted, was
the murderer of Pearle. Mr. Lareur plead in excuse for neglecting
the Post Office that he was appointed to it without his Solicitation,
and that he cannot Submit to the confinement and drudgery of the
office.
Every essential allegation contained in the preceding Statement,
may be confirmed by reference to Judge Breckenridge, Col. Tutt,
Robert Mitchell, Esq, of Pensacola, and by Com. Elliott and Capt
Shubrick of the U. S. Navy.
Any explanations or corroborating testimony which the nature of
this communication may require, will be at any time, most cheerfully
rendered by
Your truly respectful & Obedient Servant

GEORGE W. LONG TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER
[NA:WD, CE Lets. Recd. L 217:ALS]
ASPALAGA Sept 20" 1831
SIR Sickness having prevented my making my proper report for
last month, I avail myself of this, the earliest period of my strength
to write after my recovery to apprise you of the operations of improv-
ing the navigation of the Apalachicola River that have been going
On.”
I set a party of fifteen hands at work near the last of July excavating
through the two lowest bends named to you in my proposed plan of
operations; in which I changed the plan to cut three ditches ten feet
wide & twenty five feet apart instead of the one wide channel first
contemplated—This work was continued till the last of August when
a most unusual rise of the river took place from the late heavy rains and
prevented any further work of this kind. This rise of the river if it has
stopt the work will test completely the experiment making—As yet
the washings through the ditches have not answered my expectations,
and by the time the river falls, if the experiment does not bid fairer
for success than at present I shall think it advisable to abandon this
part of the operations especially as the funds at command will not
warrant the complete removing of the earth for a wide channel—On
the 14" of August I fitted out a gang of fourteen hands with the
Snag-boat accompanied by a house boat; which I had constructed
at Brownville 25 miles above this place. The Snag-boat consists of
two flats placed parallell to each other & eight feet apart with a wheel
& axle worked by a Capstain to work with a power of forty-tons.
This is found to answer all the purposes required. This party was
continued till the 17" Ins" when from sickness and the difficulty of
working on account of high water it was discharged
They succeeded perfectly well in removing many very troublesome
snags that had resisted all previous efforts to remove them and made
considerable further improvements in clearing away a great number
of stooping trees that were much in the way of Steam-boats. The
moment the water will allow I shall have the boats at work again with
the strongest force that can work to advantage, to complete if possible
the improvements necessary to be made this Season.
If I should discontinue the work on the bends as above suggested
there will probably be some portion of the money in my hands unex-
pended after I have done all that I deem necessary for the river: in
which case I am requested to enquire of the Department by Isaac
Brown a worthy citizen of this neighborhood & my overseer, if an
account he has against the U.S. of $600, for which he performed a

DEAR SIR It is with regret that I have to announce to you the
death of our much esteemed friend, James G. Ringgold, U. States
Attorney for this district. He died on the 22" Inst.” Great exertions
will be made by the dismissed cabinet, nullification, & Calhoun party,
here to induce the President to appoint either MF Dunlap, M Camp-
bell, or M" Allen," his successor. Those persons are well known,
here, to be nullifiers, and devoted friends of the Calhoun party—dis-
approving of the presidents course relative to the dissolution of his
late cabinet, and speak, as their whole party do, in the most intolerable
termes of Maj. Eaton & his wife. They will, however, no doubt en-
deavour to make the president believe, that those opposed to them,
in Florida, are all his enimies, and claim to them selves as they always
have done, to be the only persons in Florida who are Jackson men,
and who have Jackson influence
Charles E. Shearman Esqr formally of New York, will be an applicant
for this office, you are well acquainted with his eminent talents and
quallifications to fill that office,—all that I can say therefore, is, that,
should he be appointed, I am satisfied that it will give general satisfac-

Department, I now furnish a report of the opperations in the work of
improveing the river and Harbour of St Marks for the past year
ending on the 30th ultimo. At the commencement of that year the
Opperations were confined to the improvement of the River from its
mouth to its source, and were continued, until about the middle of
November when the whole was completed. In the progress of those
improvements no attempt was made to remove the “natural ob-
Structions” (refer" to in the Survey and report of David B Macomb
Esqr.) laying in the bed of the river, but the opperations were directed
wholy to the removal of the “casual or accidental” obstructions
made by the falling of large trees into the middle of the river, and
those whose bodies, limbs, and bows, overhung it so as in some places
to be almost impassable. This portion of the work could only be
done witheat by common labour and without the aid of Machinery
and being of as much importance as any other part contemplated
by the act makeing the appropriations, I thought it adviseable to
progress with it towards completion in order that no part of the
opperations might interrupt the improvements in the Harbour which
it was then supposed would be commenced in the early part of the
winter. The river from its mouth up to this place has been free" of
all artificial obstructions to Schooner navigation and from this to its
source Rock Haven has been improved for boat or scow navigation.
After the completion of this section, the force employ" was dis-
charged except a small part which was retained for the purpose of
procureing fuel for the Machine which was to opperate in the Har-
bour. Upon the conclusion of the Engineer Department to transfer
the Machine which was then in use at Mobile p" to the work in the
Harbour of St Marks my attention was directed to a correspondence
with Leut Ogden in relation to its immediate shipment. Reflecting
on the many engagements of that Gentleman I concluded that to
insure expedition in geting the Machine to St. Marks, it would be
better for me to go to Mobile point and attend personally to its
Shipment and the engagement of an Engineer & Machinest. The
Engineer Department were duly informed of my haveing adopted
the course Just mentioned and of the delay, disapointment and con-
fusion which attended the transfer of the Machine." Supposeing
that the Machine would arrive at St. Marks (as I had arranged it
before I left Mobile) on about the 20th to the 31 Jany. I on my
return home commenced the procurement of timbers for the large
flat in which the Machine is placed and for two releiveing lighters.
It would be proper for me here to observe that the flat and lighters
* A number of letters from Willis kept the department informed during 1831

which had been connected with the Machine at Mobile point could
not in any way be removed to St. Marks, unless at enormous expense
and even then with an almost certainty of being lost at sea. Not
being advised by either Leut. Ogden or M" M*Cartney (the Engineer
and Machinest who had been sent back to Mobile point to attend
to the Shipment of the Machine) of the particular pieces of timber
required for the Machine flat and lighters I employ" a few hands to
procure such only as I knew would be necessary expecting the infor-
mation desired on this subject by every mail on the arrival of M"
M°Cartney about the middle or last of June from Mobile with the
Machine, it was ascertained that the Machine flat and lighters were
somewhat of different construction than I had supposed. requireing
stronger timbers in every part. They have been procured and the
Machine flat will in a few days be ready to receive the Machine.
The lighters are in that state of forwardness which will ensure their
completion while we are puting up the Machine. In a few days the
Dredgeing opperations will be in full motion
If the past summer in this country had been an ordinary season
the Dredgeing opperations would have been commenced from 4 to 6
weeks earlier. About the first of July the rainy season commenced
and continued with scarcely a days intermission until the latter part
of August. This it is supposed, caused the sickness which has pre-
vailed through the country and which has deprived us of some of our
most valued citizens. As an evidence of its extent it is estimated
that five out of every seven of the white population of the Middle
district of Florida have been afflicted with disease. Its influence I
have seriously felt in the work under my charge. I have not with-
standing deem" it important to go on while a man could be found to
strike a blow, in order that a full season in which such work can be
Judiciously done may be allow" in the approaching fall and Winter
for the removal of the obstructions in the Harbour.”

asked for was of minor importance, but such opinion, would be erro-
IleOuS.
It has been estimated that the fish and turtle, taken in the fisheries
on the Coasts, and in the waters contiguous to the Islands and Keys
of Florida, and sold in the Havanna and other places in Cuba, exceed
one hundred thousand dollars annually. There are besides many
sold and consumed in the United States, and elsewhere. There are a
number of Wessels, generally smacks from twenty to fifty tons burthen,
employed Solely in that business; and several persons pursue it, and also
the employment of salvors, or wrecking, in the same vessels. Some
years ago these fisheries were referred to by a gentleman" very compe-
tent to judge in this respect, in a report made to the Government, of an
exploration of the Peninsula, as a topographical engineer; as one of the
most valuable resources of the Country. More recently other intelli-
gent gentlemen, who have taken an interest in the subject, and have
made investigations to arrive at the value of these fisheries, and the
practicability of their regulation by law for such purpose, have ad-
vanced the opinion, that they can be made the source of considerable
revenue to our local Treasury. At the last Session of the Territorial
legislature, the Judiciary Committee of the Council, were instructed to
enquire into the subject, with that object; but for want of time to pay
that attention to the subject, its importance demanded, it was deferred
to the next session of the Council in January 1832. The law proposed
by those who brought the subject forward, I am informed, required
all persons taking fish &c with intent to carry them out of the territory,
whether such persons were foreigners or not, and whether the fish
were carried to foreign ports or not, to procure a permit for that pur-
pose, and to pay an officer appointed by the Territorial authorities, a
certain amount imposed as an equivalent for such privilige, and regu-
lated by the quantity of fish carried away. It created a forfeiture
of vessel and cargo, and an infliction of personal penalties, for its viola-
tion. It is expected that a similar law will be proposed at the ap-
proaching Session in January next, and will probably be enacted;
and application will also most probably be made to Congress, for aid
in its enforcement; as otherwise, obstacles may arise, at first, to an
effectual and complete execution of its provisions. If the general
government should regard it as contrary to sound policy, as an un-
warrantable assumption of power, as conflicting with the interests
of the United States, or as interfering with its engagements to, or the
spirit of courtesy proper to be observed towards the British Govern-

ment, as it is subject to the revision of Congress it can if advisable
be abrogated before its enforcement is attempted.
The fish and turtle are chiefly (if not all) taken in the Sounds,
bays &c on the Coasts, and in the waters contiguous to and between
the Islands and Keys, and in shoal waters; and as it believed will be
admitted, entirely within the local jurisdiction. It is contended by
some of those of our citizens, who have interested themselves in this
subject, that the right of piscary in these waters is wholly local, and
belongs exclusively and solely to the citizens of Florida. This exclu-
sive claim, is founded upon their inhabitancy of the country to which
these fisheries naturally and geographically appertain. They are not
sufficiently beyond the local jurisdiction as to render them of the
national character, of the mackarel, cod, and whale fisheries, and to
place them under the control and protection of the National govern-
ment.
It is also urged, that if the general government, have control over
this right of piscary, it is owing to our situation at this time (being only
a Territory) and that when we become a state, this right, and the
entire regulation of these fisheries, will revert to the State government,
as appurtenant to the local or state sovereignty. There are also those,
who deny any authority in Congress, even at this time, to interfere
with these fisheries, except in the revision, (as prescribed in our
“Organic Act,”) of our Territorial laws.
It is not considered necessary or proper on this occasion, to offer
arguments to shew whether all or any of these views, of the rights of
the general government, and of the People of Florida, are false or
sound:—they can be as properly and justly weighed without the
very humble aid I could render. The most entire confidence is re-
posed, that no measure compromitting the rights or interests of our
citizens, beyond what it is their duty as good citizens cheerfully to
acquiesce in; nor any course tending to fetter the State government,
which it is trusted is soon to be organized in Florida; will be pursued
by those now entrusted with the administration of the National
government.
It would seem that the British Minister is under the impression,
that the inhabitants of the Bahamas, enjoyed the accomodation
asked for, before the cession of the Floridas to the United States, and
until the British West India Islands were closed to the commerce of
the United States, and that the accomodation was refused to be
continued, in consequence of this restriction upon our commerce.
That no persons of any nation were prevented from fishing within
the waters of Florida before the cession; and also from doing many
other things, since prohibited by our laws, is correct. The extension

of the favor of fishing as then enjoyed by strangers, did not conflict
with the interests of the Spanish population of Florida. The num-
ber of Floridians then employed in the fisheries, was compared to
the number now engaged, quite limited. In fact as those employed
in the business supplied S" Augustine, and Pensacola, and other
Spanish towns, among which, were as at present, the Havanna &
Matanzas, inducements to favor them, rather than otherwise existed
with the Spanish authorities. The Spanish population of Florida,
for years previous to the cession, did not equal one eighth of the
present number of its inhabitants. It was confined chiefly to the
cities of St Augustine and Pensacola, and their vicinity. If they had
been disposed not to permit, they had not the power to prevent, the
use of these fisheries by strangers.
Soon after the cession and before the West India ports were closed
to the U. S. and as the population of Florida increased, especially
down the Peninsula and on its coasts, and on the Islands and Keys,
these fisheries were found to be highly valuable, and in some respects
necessary, for the use of the Inhabitants of the Country, especially
those near the Sea Coast.
The Seminole Nation of Indians, who use many of these fish, were
also about this time, removed to the Peninsula; and confined by
treaty to it. The policy and laws of the United States, and of the
Territory, required, that no foreigners should have those oppor-
tunities of association with them, which the use of those fisheries,
and the consequent frequenting of our Coasts permitted.
Difficulties occurred between residents of the Bahamas, who
visited our Coasts in vessels under the pretext of fishing, but really
to carry on the employment of Salvors, and our citizens engaged in
the same pursuit, and in consequence of the improper conduct of the
former, in a variety of ways, and among others in taking vessels
across the gulf stream, into Nassau, and other places for the adjudi-
cation of salvage for services rendered on our Coasts, and in our
waters, and jurisdiction; the latter resolved to force all foreigners to
forsake those fisheries, and also the wrecking business on our Coasts.
No violence was it is believed, committed, but they coalesced, and
avoided all amicable association with the foreigners,—refused to
furnish provisions, or aid them in any manner,-threw every possible
obstacle in their way, -enforced rigorously the revenue laws of the
U. S. relating to foreign vessels in our waters, and also the laws
regulating intercourse with the Indians, and adopted many other
expedients extremely vexatious to those against whom they oper-
ated. After sometime, in consequence of the conduct of the wreckers
from the Bahamas, the Act of the 3rd of March 1825, entitled “An


## p. 561 (#577) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 561
act concerning wrecks on the Coasts of Florida,” was passed by
Congress.”
No officer had authority or instructions from,-nor was any person
incited, aided, or countenanced by either the National or Territorial
government, in driving the fishermen & wreckers of the Bahamas, from
our Coasts, except such assistance as was afforded by the legal prosecu-
tions in our Courts, authorized by the Acts of Congress above noticed,
and which acts it should be observed were mere local, municipal,
regulations, that all foreigners coming within our jurisdiction, and
especially those using these priviliges, were bound not to infringe.
Indeed the privilige asked for, has never been denied the Inhabitants
of the Bahamas, by our Government, nor has any legislation been had
with a view to such effect, either by Congress or the Territorial legis-
lature.
The measures of our fishermen and wreckers, and the enactment of
the last mentioned Act of Congress, and the alluring prospects for
settlement in our Territory, induced many who wished to continue or
embark in the business of fishing and wrecking, to become residents
of Florida, and citizens of the United States; and among them were
several Inhabitants of the Bahamas. All this was anterior to the clos-
ing of the West India Ports to our commerce. But to prove that
the obstacles thrown in the way of the Bahamians, fishing on our
Coasts, by our fishermen and wreckers, was not induced by any feelings
arising from that measure of the British Government, it is only neces-
sary to state: that the regulation closing the West India ports, was
highly advantageous to the citizens of Florida. We had no trade that
it could affect injuriously. Standing in most respects to the Northern
and Western States as do the British West India Islands—purchasing
the same products and disposing in return of the same articles, the
closing of the ports by shutting up their markets as to the United
States, made our purchases more plentiful and cheaper, and by
decreasing the importations from those Islands, enhanced the demand
for, and the price of our products. Besides much of the Capital, and
many persons who had been employed in the West India trade, but
who in consequence were forced into other employments, were induced
to emigrate to our Territory, and to seek out, and put into action the
latent resources of our new, and theen comparatively unknown
country. It is therefore repeated, that the course pursued towards
the Inhabitants of the Bahamas, by individuals & which in some meas-
ures operated to prevent their enjoyment of these fisheries, was not
in any wise in retaliation for, or owing to the closing of the West India
Ports, and that their own improper abuse of this privilige provoked
664 STAT. 132-133.

such course. If however the measures pursued by our fishermen and
wreckers (without the encouragement and not at the instance of the
Government,) had not been effectual, it is probable, that the ascer-
tainment, upon the settlement and improvement of the country since,
that these fisheries were valuable and that the interests of the inhabi-
tants required the exclusive use of them to be retained for them alone,
would have induced measures by the Territorial, if not by the national
government, with that object in view.
The considerations existing against granting the extension asked for
previously, have not lost their force, by the recent arrangement be-
tween the two two governments, opening the West India ports to
American Commerce.
Although the limits assigned the Seminoles by the Treaty," do not
extend to within fifteen miles of the sea, it has been found necessary,
to suffer them to visit the Coasts and obtain fish. The practice cannot
be discontinued without exposing them to great suffering. Upon the
extension of the favor asked for, it would be next to impossible to
prevent association between them and the foreign fishermen, and such
intercourse would inevitably lead to infractions of the laws of the
United States in regard to trading with them,--would be destructive
of all government over the Indians, and might lead to the most danger-
Ous consequences.
Checks, and restraints, and facilities for detection, apprehension,
and punishment, exist with regard to our citizens, who may violate
the revenue laws of the United States, and other laws of the general
and territorial governments, that could not be imposed upon non
resident foreigners, approaching our Coasts in Wessels. Indeed such
opportunities for smuggling especially, would be afforded to foreigners
by the extension of this privilige, that it could not be prevented.
If the privilige was granted, it is feared also, it would again be used
as a pretext to enable interferance, and competition with our citizens
in the business of wrecking; and would lead to collisions, and disputes,
and difficulties, and engender feelings, calculated to disturb the
harmony, which between two nations having the same origin, laws,
and language, should be preserved as a matter not merely of reciprocal
interest, but of mutual pride.
If the President however, should conceive the National Government
possesses the power, and that either courtesy to the British Govern-
ment, or the interests of our own, renders an express grant or extension
of the privilige asked for, proper or advisable; it is trusted, that it
will be granted only, with conditions, that will render those who use
the fisheries, amenable to such laws as may be enacted for the regula-

[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:ALS]
KEY WEST, Flor. Oct. 12, 1831.
To the Hon Senate & House of Representatives of the U States
Pear Sir, I have recently addressed a note to the Postmaster
General” in relation to the inconveniences & privations we labor
under from want of regular & certain mail communications. Under
existing circumstances, it will, unquestionably, be less expensive for
Government & most convenient for all concerned that our mail-
route should be via Tampa Bay. True, there is not yet a Postoffice
at Tampa; but I learn from Capt. Saunders (sutler at that post.)
that the establishment of one soon is expected. Two light packet-
boats employed between this port & Tampa would give us a mail
every week—& what is nearly as consequential, periodical & certain
means of transmission to any & all parts of the continent.—In dis-
cussing this business, two important matters should be brought into
the consideration—intercourse with our squadron on the West
Indias, & if an interchange of mails with the Spanish Postoffice
should be negtiated, intercourse direct with the island of Cuba.
Such a state of things would very soon produce funds sufficient to
defray the expences of the proposed route.

There is another matter of some consequence to me & to those
who reside on this island, in which I beg your agency—a suitable site
& building for a Postoffice. The lot on which the Custom House
buildings stand is owned by the proprietors of the island, & will
eventually, I imagine, be purchased by the General Government.
This lot is well situated, & sufficiently large to contain all the buildings
that now are or which may hereafter become necessary for both
Custom House & Post Office. In the mean time, the buildings now
on the lot & belonging to the U. S. are sufficiently capacious & con-
veniently arranged to accommodate both the Collector & Postmaster;
& all that is wanted to effect the object required is an order from the
Treasury Department conveying to the Postoffice Department
jurisdiction over or right to occupy a portion of the buildings. Dr.
Lacy will be able to inform you of the dimensions, localities, divi-
sions, &c. of these buildings.
You will do me a great favor to transmit per mail a copy of all
important reports & other documents relating to this portion of the
country.
The Governor's proclamation for holding an extra election for
Delegate to Congress was rec’d here in season, but no extra election
has been held. The excitement, at least in this district, had passed off;
& the good people were slowly but surely coming to their senses.
Suffer me to repeat a suggestion made some time since, that a visit
from you to this place, (your actual presence here), would do more
to remove doubts, dissipate prejudices, & silence lying tongues, than
all other means combined.
Most truly, Your &c.

RECOMMENDATION OF SAMUEL BLAIR AS UNITED
STATES MARSHAL
[NA:SD, Applications:DS]
[October 12, 1831]
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
Waters Smith the Marshal of the Eastern District of Florida
departed this life on the Tenth day of the present month”—perhaps
there has never been a Ministerial Officer of any Court, more esteemed
whilst living, or more regretted when dead—He has left a numerous
and helpless family, who were totally dependant on his exertions, and
are now destitute without them.—M" Samuel Blair, is a member of
this family, and the Son in law of the Marshal—M Blair was educated
to the Bar, and for some time has been acting as Deputy to his father
in Law—He is a Kentuckian of a good family, and is for himself as
well as for the family of the Marshall totally dependant on the Office.—
The death of the Marshal, and the situation of his family has excited
a sympathy and compassion here seldom or never witnessed on the
death of any single individual—and we would on the force of the above
fact most earnestly request of your Excellency the appointment of
M Blair to the Vacancy—His education, the respectability of his
connections in Kentucky his experience in and present tenure of the
office as Deputy, without other considerations would justify this
application—but his connection with M Smith as his Son in law, as
the last stay of a helpless family, as the only individual, who can settle
his accounts do in the humble opinion of the Subscribers place his
claim beyond a controvercy and with hope and confidence of success
we appeal to the Justice and sympathy of the President-

Secretary of the Navy on the subject of “the live oak belonging to
Government on the Gulf of Florida”—In replying thereto I beg leave

or other person any reports whatever as alleged to have been made
to me nor have any measures been pursued by me on the subject
further than what I now have the pleasure of submitting.
I have understood that an individual in this District was engaged
in building two vessels from the live oak growing on New River but
whether the timber has been cut from the public land or is private
property has not yet been ascertained. A few days since, I com-
municated with Capt. Piercy" of the schooner Spark who has pro-
ceeded to New River in consequence, and on his return to this place
he will report to me fully on the subject. I shall then further com-
municate Sir to you what measures will have been adopted on the

APALACHICOLA RIVER Near Ft Gadsden Novr 1 1831
SIR I herewith enclose my monthly report for the month of Octo-
ber–
The Stage of the water was such as to allow me to commence the
operation of improving the navigation of the river about the first of the
month. The Boats were accordingly furnished with the force stated
in the Report and proceeded to complete the work in that part of the
river called the narrows.
The work engaged in consists in removing the Snags & logs in the
bed of the river, breaking such rafts of drift wood as may be collected
clearing the way for it to pass freely and clearing the falling-in banks
of the river of such timber as will be liable to fall in it & injure its
navigation. The narrows extending about 50 miles above Ft Gadsden
has been the most difficult part of the river for boats; nearly the whole
of this, as far as I can see, is now as open & easy for navigation as it
can be made without an expense far beyond what would be practicable
to Straighten it at the places I had at first proposed to do—
The work through the narrows is so far finished that it will be com-
pleted by the middle of November when the boats will ascend the river
and work at all places requiring to be improved to the forks of the
Flint & Chatahootchie rivers. This will occupy till about the middle
of December when I shall wait your further instructions

ACTING GOVERNOR WESTCOTT TO THOMAS L. SMITH
[FSL: Fla., Gov. Exec. Corr.: M*1]
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE Nov 6th 1831–
SIR, When Governor Duval left the Territory some days since he
requested me to answer your letter to him of the 12th of September
last requesting estimates for the year 1832 as early as possible.
Serious indisposition has prevented me hitherto from performing that
duty. In relation to the Indian appropriations for Florida I have no
information except that gathered from the laws as I have never had
any concern with the Indian accounts: I presume they should be the
same as for the last year. The last civil appropriation made for this
Territory was by the Act approved March 2nd 1831 Chap 55 Acts 2nd
Ses 21st Cong.” The appropriation in that law “for compensation
and mileage of the members of the Legislative Council, pay of officers
& servants of the Council fuel stationary printing and distribution of
the laws was $7640 including $248 for arrearges. This appropriation
of $7640 was insufficient to pay the expenses of 1831. Adam Gordon
has an outstanding account for publication of the laws of $155 which
is yet unpaid " and E. B. Gould has informed me his certified account
for same service was not fully paid at the Treasury and that a balance
of $13 was left in arrear. The new appropriation should cover these
amounts which with an appropriation of $7500 will be sufficient
although new furniture will have to be purchased by the Council for
the coming Session, and an additional expense incurred.
The contingent fund for the Territory should be $350. as heretofore.
The last Legislative Council applied for an appropriation from Con-
gress of $1500 for printing a compilation of the laws absolutely neces-
sary to the people of Florida." Col: White the Delegate has the
papers upon this subject to whom I beg reference may be made and I
also enclose a copy of the laws & resolution of the Council on the sub-
ject vide pages 38 & 96 of book enclosed; as the publication will now

ASPALAGA November 15" 1831
SIR Your letter directing me to investigate & report the particular
facts of Browns claim has been duely received "—
I have enquired into the case and find the following material circum-
stances of it capable of being proved—
Sometime in the summer of 1829 Brown entered into contract with
Macomb to clear the river of its obstructions at the river Sticks and
widen it 100 feet, by cutting off a point of land that projected into the
new channel that was forming, for which Macomb was to pay him
$600. This contract was witnessed by Judge Brackenridge while in
company with Col. White at Macombs house. This paper was left
with Macomb, who now says that it is lost. It appears also that
Brown can prove that he proceeded to fulfill the contract without
delay on his part and in the same season widened the channel 150
feet and completed his contract in other respects except the removing
of one log which he could not obtain force enough to draw ashore.
The following season however he succeeded in removing the log and
finishing the contract on his part as he understood it and as Macomb
had stated repeatedly, that when the log was removed he should be
entirely satisfied with the work and that the money would be ready
for him Brown has never been able to obtain any money for the work
he performed or even any settlement with him whatever-
These are the facts on which the claim is founded, which I furnish
you without waiting the proof of them on account of the short space
of time previous to finishing the operations under my charge & my

NICHOLAS P. TRIST TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:SD, Applications:ALS]
WASHINGTON, Nov 16, 1831.
SIR, My acquaintance with Mr Tho" Eston Randolph, lately
appointed marshal of the middle district of Florida,” dated no fur-
ther back than the year 1818, on my return to Virginia; since which,
to the time of his removal to Florida, I have known him as one of
the most esteemed citizens and magistrates of the county of Albe-
marle. Not knowing, therefore, from what circumstances the idea
could have arisen of his being “an unnaturalized foreigner,” I have
enquired of Mrs Randolph, my mother-in-law; who has given me
the following details.
Mr T. E. Randolph's father, one of the sons of William Randolph
of Dungeonett on James River, was a native Virginian, and brother
of the mother of Thomas Jefferson. He went to England before the
revolution, and settled as a merchant at Bristol, where T. E. R. was
born. This gentleman came to Virginia about forty years ago;
inherited the Dungeonett Estate, through his father, and married a
daughter of Col° Thomas Mann Randolph of Tuckahoe. He has
never been out of the country since.
I will only add, without the remotest intention to reflect on those
by whom they may be urged, that any ether ebjeetions my convic-
tion that any other objections against this appointment would
on enquiry prove as ill grounded as that which has elicited this
communication.

&c and that this Sum Shall be “sued for, levied and recovered” and
so on; whilst the first section clearly contemplates and to judge from
its phraseology requires a criminal proceedure against the trans-
gressor—If this apparent ambiguity could be explained I should be
much obliged, as under existing circumstances I cannot feel by any
means certain of the course I ought to pursue on any occasion where
the law has been violated.—An instance of this Sir has very lately

TALLAHASSEE, 24th. Nov 1831
HONBLE. EDWARD LIVINGSTON, Secretary of State,
SIR. I had the honour, by the preceding mail, to acknowledge the
receipt of the commission" appointing me United States Attorney
for the Western District of Florida, and to notify the Department of
my acceptance of the same.
The commission was not received in time to enable me to attend
the courts in Escambia and Walton Counties, and I have not yet
had time so to arrange my business here as to permit my immediate
removal into the district. I shall be able to attend the other two
counties, Washington and Jackson. The death of Col. James A.
Dunlap has vacated that place in this district and I would be happy,
if it comports with the views of the Department, to be exchanged
into this district. I have notwithstanding readily and with pleasure
given my name to a paper recommending my friend, M. Leslie A.
Thompson for the situation, first informing him that I should seek
to be exchanged.”
With great respect, I have the honor to be, Yr. mo. obt. servt.

natural Bridge—you will therefore after you have taken charge of
the operations on that River avail yourself of the first leisure time
you have to make the investigation in question and report to the

moval of the Bridge and also of improving the navigation from
Magnolia upwards.

SIR I herewith enclose my monthly report of the operations of
improving the navigation of the Apalachicola river for the month of
NOV 1831.14
The force employed on the river has been continued in that part
of it called the narrows, in removing the rafts and clearing the banks
where the heavy timber was liable to be washed into its channel.
In removing the rafts it was found necessary to go over with the
work once or twice to clear them effectually as by removing the upper
logs & snags a few days was found sufficient for the sand to wash
from the bottom ones which would then rise to the surface & require
to be removed. This part of the river I now consider as well improved
& cleared of obstructions as is at all practicable. The channel has
no obstructions for any craft that may navigate it.
The boats are now about 50 miles below the forks of the Chata-
houchee & Flint rivers working upwards. This part of the river is
quite free from logs or Snags and will require not more than 15 or
20 days work which will complete the improvements of the river
agreeable to my views of it "

WASHINGTON Dec 3th 1831
SIR, I take leave to recommend a continuance of the publication
of the laws of the U States in the same Journals in Florida in which
they have been heretofore published—These papers are of the most
extensive circulation in the Territory & well situated at Pensacola,
Tallahassee & St Augustine—The paper at Tallahassee is the
“Floridian’ & I learn an effort will be made to have it transfered to a
vulgar, blackguard paper called the “Courier”—This last gazette
was purchased to Serve the purposes of a local faction, & was designed
to be supported on the patronage of the govement—It has already
Sunk for the want of funds, & I learn that two whole numbers have
not been printed in two months—
The Floridian is better edited & printed, has a much more extensive
Circulation & will do the work in a neater and better manner. The
Courier is devoted to vilification with a limited circulation & is without
exception the most blackguard paper in the Union
The local faction in Florida represent every Press & person who does
not support them as apposed to the administration—I enclose you
some of the numbers of the Floridian to refute such a charge

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE PLANTERS AND
CITIZENS COMPANY
[NA:SF, 22 Cong., 1 sess:C]
[Referred December 12, 1831]
To the Honorable the Senate and the House of Representatives of the
United States in Congress assembled.—
Your Memorialists respectfully shew to your honorable body that
they have associated themselves together and have become in-
corporated by the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida *
by the name of The Planters and Citizens Company for the purpose
of constructing a Canal from the waters of Matanzas River at Mala
Compra in the County of St: Johns to Smith's Creek a water of
Halifax river in Musquito County.”
That the said Canal must necessarily pass over a considerable
tract of Country owned by the United States, to obtain a grant of
which is the object of this Memorial.
The Lands thus asked for consist of wet Savannas and pine-barren
of very little value in their present state, but by draining the Savanna
may be rendered good tillable land and the pine timber on the rest
will be necessary in the construction of the Canal, So far as Private
Property is embraced in the route which is about Three and a half
miles, the Proprietors have cheerfully ceded it to the Company, and
your Memorialists have ventured to hope that the Congress of a
great Nation will not refuse so far to encourage the industrious
exertions of the Citizens in making public improvements as to furnish
their share of the foundation on which these improvements are to be
made, especially when it is shewn that the Canal when cut will open
to the Planters one hundred miles distant from St. Augustine a ready
market for their produce and to obtain in return, the articles neces-
sary for their plantations for which at this time they are obliged to
resort to Charleston Three hundred miles distant at an enormous
expense and great risk. The Public lands also situate on the exten-
sive waters of the Halifax and Hillsborough rivers will be encreased
* Approved Feb. 8, 1831, Fla., Acts, 1831, pp. 76–79.
* Griswold, Simmons, and Williams, three of the signers, reported to a meeting
of the citizens of St. Augustine on Dec. 14, 1830, that the canal could be completed
if they joined with the planters of the neighborhood to obtain lands from Congress
(St. Augustine, Fla. Herald, Dec. 24, 1830). Senate bill 74 was reported to the
House by the Committee on Internal Improvements, Jan. 25, 1831 (NA, HF,
21 Cong., 2 sess., printed, House Journal, 21 Cong., 2 sess., p. 112), and contained
an amendment in the handwriting of Del. White providing for another canal
through the public lands from the Matanzas to the Halifax River, The act
approved Mar, 2, 1831 (4 STAT. 475), included this amendment.

in value in the same proportion with private property a value far
superior to that of the lands asked by your Memorialists.
And your Memorialists further shew that the Canal proposed to
be made is part of that internal navigation formerly proposed by the
Government to be made along the Eastern Coast to the Florida Keys
an improvement that in times of Peace will unite the interests and
greatly facilitate the intercourse between our Citizens, and in time
of War will render easy and safe the transportation of Troops and
the Munitions of an Army.
Your Memorialists therefore pray that your honorable body will
please to grant to them the Public Lands extending one half mile
on each side of the said projected Canal from the lands of Doctor
Peter Porcher at Byke Plantation to the lands of Mr John Bulow
on Smith’s Creek a distance of about Six Miles.

SIR. I am fully aware of the rule of the different Departments of the

& am also fully sensible of the propriety of that rule in its general
application, but there no doubt has, and may continue to occur cir-
cumstances which would permit a deviation from it. I am of opinion
that those circumstances now exist with regard to the petitions against
me headed and forwarded by the Messers Hamlens to the Eng" Dpt.”

Although your letter of the 16th Ulto.” with the enclosed reply to the

[NA:ND, NRL, Subject File PF:LS]
ATTORNEY GENERAL's OFFICE [December 28, 1831]
SIR, In reply to the enquiry of M" Chandler the District Attorney
of South Florida," as to the proper mode of proceeding against
offenders, under the act of Congress of March 2, 1831 ch. 65 entitled
“An act to provide for the punishment of offences committed in
cutting, destroying or removing live oak & other timber or trees
reserved for naval purposes—” * I have the honor to state that the
proceeding by indictment appears to be the only proper one to punish
the offences embraced by the first section of the law and the same
mode would I have no doubt be a correct one to recover the penalty
“not exceeding one thousand dollars” mentioned in the second sec-
tion—If a ship has become forfeited under the 2" section, the proceed-
ing by Information against the ship would be the usual and advisable
form.—The words in the third section are as M* Chandler suggests
calculated to create some ambiguity.—
But in all prosecutions against an offender in order to inflict on
him a fine or any other punishment for an offence committed by him,
I hold that the proceeding by indictment is the one most consonant
to our institutions & the principles of our government—and therefore
that it is the legitimate and proper mode in every case unless a different
one is specifically pointed out by the Statute
I am Sir very respectfully Yr. ob"S"

PRESENTMENTS OF THE GRAND JURY OF JACKSON
COUNTY
[NA:SD, Misc. Letters: Pr."]
[December, 1831]
Presentments of the Grand Jury of Jackson County, West Florida, at
the December Term 1831. With the Charge of the Honorable H.
M. Brackenridge, Published at the instance of the Grand Jurors of
Jackson and Washington Counties.
The Grand Jurors for the County of Jackson, in the performance of
their duties as a Grand inquest of said County, present as oppres-
sive, the Fee Bill of the officers of the Territory generally, but partic-
ularly those relating to Justices Courts, and respectfully reccommend
the Council to have them amended and reduced to similar rates of the
adjacent States, also to confine the jurisdiction of Justices of the
Peace in like manner, and confine Justices and Constables in civil
business to their districts, without milage to the latter. They would
farther recommend that jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace extend
to 100 dol., and that the County Court have concurrent jurisdiction
with the Superior Court in civil cases.
In taking leave of the Court, we beg leave to present to his Honor,
Judge Brackinredge, our thanks, for his very able and luminous
charge addressed to this body, on their being empanelled, and his
conduct so highly satisfactory on the Bench.
The several matters contained in his charge, and animadverted on
by his Honor, are certainly of the highest importance to the com-
munity, most especially that which relates to the uncertainty of the
law; it is indeed a grievance to every well organized community, that
the laws should be so uncertain, that not only the common citizen,
but those learned in the science, cannot determine what the law is—
we would therefore present this uncertainty, as a grievance, and re-
quest that our representation, will use their exertions to remedy the
evil. We respectfully request of his Honor, that he will permit his
charge, in pamphlet form, or otherwise, to be printed, accompanying
these presentments.
The Grand Jury take much pleasure in presenting their thanks, to
the District Attorney, John K. Campbell, Esqr., for his prompt atten-
tion to their calls upon him for information, during the session of the
Court.

Joseph H. Russ,
GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY:
The oath you have taken, comprises an epitome of your duties.
A part of it may appear to require of you, something more than the
accusations against individuals for violations of the criminal laws of
the Territory, and it is not unusual for Grand Juries, to enquire into
grievances of a public nature, where the law has provided no par-
ticular remedy. It is also customary for them, to express their senti-
ments on various subjects, in which the public welfare is concerned.
Such presentments, (if they may be so called) however tending to the
advancement of good morals, in general, and of the prosperity of the
community, furnish nothing upon which the Court can proceed to
act, in its judicial capacity. The Court, therefore, can only consider
the Grand Jury as a component part, and a most important one, in
the administration of criminal justice. Topics of morality, ex-
pediency, or policy, should properly be referred to others, who are
disposed, and whose duty it may be, to enlighten their fellow-citizens.
It must be admitted, however, that there are subjects of a general
nature, where the expression of the opinion, of the highly respectable
individuals who compose the Grand Jury, may be attended with very
salutary effects, but this must be left to their own good sense and dis-
cretion. There are some subjects which properly belong to the duties
of the Grand Jury, although no specific offence be presented; such for
instance, as the situation of the public prisons, and others connected
with the administration of justice.
The proper province of the Grand Jury, is that of an accusing tribu-
nal; for according to our institutions, no man can be put upon his
trial on a criminal charge, without the sanction of such a body of
men, selected from among the inhabitants of the county, where the
offence is supposed to have been committed, and acting under the
solemnity of an oath. That oath, forbids all accusation from motives
of malice, envy or hatred; and at the same time, enjoins the accusation
of those, who have offended against the criminal laws, without regard
to fear, favor, affection, or reward. In all communities of civilized
men, this is one of the most important duties of government. The
weak must be protected; the lawless and violent, must be restrained.
On this the peace of society, as well as the security of the individual

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 611
depends. Although all human institutions are imperfect, I am yet
satisfied that nothing better was ever contrived to accomplish this
great object, than the introduction of Grand Juries. This institution,
is one, whose origin cannot easily be traced; it is peculiar to this
country, and to the soil of our British ancestors; it is esteemed and
justly valued, by those enlightened nations which do not enjoy its
benefits; it is one of those happy productions, whose seed, like those
of some of the noblest plants of the earth, must be referred to the
giver of every good and perfect gift. By this institution the punish-
ment of crimes is made the immediate duty of the community itself.
In those countries, whose government is denominated despotic, or
even where they have emerged from that state, to badly regulated
liberty, we may witness the dreadful effects of unpunished crimes or
oppressed innocence, where accusation is altogether prompted by
individual feelings, or where it is left to the Magistrate, who is to
pronounce upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, without the
previous interposition, or sanction of a council of disinterested citizens,
of weight and character. Where in a word, they have no Grand
Jury—a body, which with us may be justly styled, the terror of the
guilty, and the shield of the innocent, although according to our laws,
another must interpose before final conviction or acquittal. In the
countries to which I have alluded, crimes may be committed with
impunity by the great and powerful; the poor and humble, dare not
complain, because they can seldom hope to prevail, and might be
made to feel the consequences of their temerity. How different would
this be, if the accusation were to proceed from such a body, as that
which I now address? In such countries where the great are the
accusers, and the unprotected the accused, the latter must either be
crushed, or compelled to endure a cruel and remediless oppression.
It was this which gave rise to the relation of client and patron among
the Romans; and among modern nations; it has compelled the com-
mon people, to submit to a slavish dependence on some lord of the
soil, who claims an exclusive right to oppress.
The Grand Jury should bear in mind, that by them only, can
offenders be brought to justice, through the medium of a trial for the
alledged offence. It is therefore their duty, to sanction the accusa-
tion, where the evidence furnishes areasonable ground to believe, that
an offence has been committed by the accused. It is not absolutely
necessary, that that evidence should amount to positive proof of
guilt, for the Grand Jury hear only the evidence on the side of the
prosecution. As far as it goes, however, it ought to be satisfactory;
it ought to be credible, and free from contradiction. It may be a
serious thing to put a man upon his trial, to compel him to undergo
its attendant mortification, and vexations, even when sustained by

conscious innocence, and the confident hope of an acquittal, on a
full and public trial, before an upright and impartial jury of his
country.
Although I have thought it unnecessary to enlarge upon the obliga-
tions of your oath, as Grand Jurors, as this should, in some measure,
form a part of the education of every American freeman, who aspires
to be properly instructed in his rights, and duties; yet, as it is the
province of the court, to explain and expound the laws, I will detain
you with some remarks, on those enacted by the Legislative Council
of this Territory, for the purpose of punishing offences.
Nothing can be more obviously important, in a community like
ours, governed by laws, than a general diffusion of a knowledge of
their enactments: for it is a maxim of the criminal law, that ignorance
excuses no man. Perhaps there cannot be found in history, a stronger
instance of tyrannical and oppressive government, or one more
proverbially cited, than that of Caligula, who wrote his laws on
Tablets in a character so fine, and suspended them on pillars at such
a height, that no one could read them, and then inflicted the punish-
ments they denounced, against those who violated them. The
Legislative Council of this Territory, it must be acknowledged, had an
arduous task to perform. In the different states of the Union, from
which you have migrated to this country, they had the advantage of
the settled code of Great Britain, and this, when altered and modified
by the cautious hand of enlightened men, with the aid of experience,
has enabled them to establish something better suited to their cir-
cumstances, and situations, without incurring the danger of un-
certainty, obscurity and confusion. The alterations might be made
from time to time, on an established system, as they were dictated by
necessity. This Territory, haveing been obtained by the United States,
through a treaty with a foreign nation, whose government was of a
despotic character, it became necessary to establish institutions en-
tirely new. The inhabitants of Florida, did not like those of the
Carolinas or Georgia, bring their laws and institutions with them;
but from their habits and predilections, in this newly settled country,
it was natural for them to look for models to those laws, and institu-
tions, under which they had enjoyed liberty, prosperity and happiness.
But the difficulty of selection has been such, as to give rise to a censure,
perhaps too just, that the criminal laws of this Territory, have not
been free from uncertainty and doubt. “Unhappy the subject of that
country,” says an elegant writer, “where the laws are vague and un-
certain.” The error with us has probably arisen in some measure,
from the varying, and unsteady character of our legislation; the
frequent repeal, or modification of our criminal laws, by which, a

fixed and certain knowledge of them by the People, has been rendered
almost impossible. It is not my wish, or my intention, to case a
censure upon the Legislative bodies of Florida; their motives were
doubtless good; but in a mistaken desire of improvement, they have
forgotten, that, certainty as to what the law is, may be of more im-
portance than even an improved modification.
The first acts of the Legislative Council were passed in the summer
of 1822, one year after the acquisition of the Territory. I was a
member of that body, by commission from the President of the
United States, but was appointed to my present situation, before the
commencement of its session. Foreseeing, however, the difficulty
under which the Territory would labor for the want of a suitable code
of laws, I had procured a volume of the digested Legislative acts of
Missouri, which had been similarly situated, having been also a prov-
ince of Spain. The Territory of Orleans, now the State of Louisiana,
continued to be governed in civil matters by Spanish laws; the greater
part of its inhabitants, having been accustomed to them, and estates
being held subject to its rules. Missouri, on the contrary, was settled
by citizens of the United States, habituated to English and American
Legislation. The volume to which I have alluded, was the result of
fifteen years experience in that State, and yet contained for the greater
part, little more than the adaptation of the joint labours of Jefferson,
Wythe and Madison, and of some of the Pennsylvania Legislators,
to the circumstances of the country. The act adopting the common
and statute law of England, prior to the 4th of July 1776,” was among
the few which can be called original. Our first Council, received this
volume as their text book, and adopted the greater part of it, with
little or no alteration. The next Council of 1823, for what cause it is
difficult to say, thought proper to repeal the whole of them at once,
instead of making such alterations, or amendments, as they might
have deemed necessary. Our Territory, has ever since experienced
the pernicious effect of this example. The whole body of the law
criminal as well as civil, not even excepting the fundamental act
which adopted the common and statute law of England, has since been
repeatedly repealed, and re-enacted, and partial alterations have
been made, by which they have been rendered vague and uncertain,
instead of being permanent and generally known. The criminal law,
which of all others ought to have been fixed, has been marked by the
same mutable character. Every succeeding year presented us with
a new code, which was repealed before the people had time to become
acquainted with it; reminding one of the web of Penelope, who undid
at night, what she had woven in the day time.

The last statute of the Territory providing for the punishment of
crimes and misdemeanors, was passed in 1828;* all acts prior to that
period were expunged from the statute books. It was hoped that in
future, we should look to this statute only, for our direction in the
administration of the criminal law. But it was soon observed, that
a most important omission had been made, in the enumeration of acts
to be in force, by the condensation act as it is styled, of the same
Council; all others being repealed. The act to which I allude, was
that before spoken of, adopting the common and statute law of
England. In the act of 1829," this omission is supplied, by the act
adopting those laws, which are of a general, and not a local nature,
down to the 4th of July 1776—with certain exceptions, thereafter
enumerated; these are, 1st, that the said Statutes, and common law,
be not inconsistent, with the Constitution and laws of the United
States, and the acts of the Legislative Council of this Territory:
2d—that none of the British Statutes, respecting crimes and misde-
meanors, shall be in force in this Territory, excepting Statutes declar-
atory of and in aid of the Common law; 3d—Nor shall any person
be punished, by the said common law, when there is an existing
provision on the subject, by the Statutes of the Territory; but when
there is no such provision, then, the several Courts of the Territory,
shall proceed to punish such offence, by fine and imprisonment, the
fine not to exceed five hundred dollars, nor the imprisonment twelve
months. At the same session an amendatory Statute was passed,
and which with that of 1828, and two other acts of the same Council,
(1829) to prevent dueling,” and to regulate interest," may now be
considered, as constituting our criminal code. The last Council,
appears to have been fully sensible of the error of their predecessors,
and have refrained from any serious alterations.
According to the Organic Law of Congress," exclusive jurisdiction
in all capital cases, is given to the Superior Courts; and by the act
of 1828, establishing County Courts," all criminal jurisdiction is with-
drawn from those Courts, with one exception, specified in the act,
and rested in the Superior Court. This Court also, takes Cognizance
of offences against the Laws of the United States, and against the
Laws of Nations; such as robbery of the Mails, Piracy, and other
offences, of which jurisdiction is given to the Courts of the United

States; and it is, also, your duty to enquire of, and present such
offences.
By the act adopting the Common Law of England, it appears that
none of the British statutes, on the subject of crimes and misde-
meanors, are in force in this Territory, except such as are declaratory,
and in aid of the Common Law; it appears further, that no part of
the Common Law INCONSISTENT with the acts of the Council, is
adopted; and again, that Common Law PUNISHMENTS, are in no
instance to be inflicted; but inlieu of them, where our own Laws are
silent, a discretionary power is given to the Court, to punish by fine
not exceeding five hundred dollars, and imprisonment, not exceeding
twelve months; so much of the Common Law therefore, on the subject
of crimes and misdemeanors, as is not thus excluded, is still in force
here.
The act of 1828, appears to have been intended as a complete
criminal code, and is therefore not confined to fixing the punishments
of offences merely, but has attempted to supplant the Common Law
writers and Judges, in the definitions, and descriptions of them, and
in the explanations of their various constituents, together with the
circumstances which serve to mitigate, excuse, or justify. This was
not attempted by the Laws of Missouri, and perhaps more wisely.
Language being imperfect, it is impossible even for the greatest
masters of it, entirely to avoid uncertainty and ambiguity. The
definitions of the Common Law, are the preductions of ages of expe-
rience, and every term, is so explicitly understood, as to leave but
few questions to be settled. In a new code, many questions must
arise; a circumstance, which militates against that certainty so nec-
essary in criminal jurisprudence. Many of the very terms used by
the Council, require explanation, and for this we must have recource
to the writers on the Common Law. The greater part of the defini-
tions contained in the code we have enacted, have been, it is true,
almost literally borrowed, or copied from that Law, and I incline to
the opinion, that it would have been more advisable, for the present,
to have referred the whole to that source. By pursuing this plan,
some of the puzzling, and perplexing abstractions, to be seen in our
code, and some of its dangerous novelties might have been avoided.
It is not my intention, to enter upon a critical examination of the
Statute, to which I have just referred. This would require a volume;
for as I have already observed, it professes to cover the whole ground
of Penal Law; but I feel disposed, by way of illustrating the remarks
I have made, to cast a glance on a portion of this important Statute.
for this purpose, I will select the 6th, 7th, and 8th sections. Whether
these are original with us, or suggested by the lucubrations of some

enlightened individual, I know not; but I am not satisfied, that they
afford any improvement of the Common Law, although at first view,
they may appear more consonant to natural reason and justice.
According to that Law, drunkenness, is no excuse for crime under any
circumstances; from sound policy, it is reguarded as an aggravation
of the offence. But according to the sixth section, just referred to, a
person in a state of intoxication, may commit the highest offence
known to the Law, with impunity, provided such intoxication has
been occasioned by the fraud or artifice of another! It is impossible
for any one to foresee the consequences of opening such a door to the
contrivances of human depravity. The 7th section, is liable to a still
more serious objection. By this it is provided, that a person com-
mitting a crime, or misdemeanor, against another, may be excused
in showing that he himself has been threatened by a third person, in
case he refused its perpetration; and on making this proof, the jury
are required to find a verdict against that third person, who may be
no party to the indictment! Thus John Styles, is indicted for a murder
committed on Samuel Stokes; on this John Styles proves that one
Richard Roe menaced him with death or mayhem, unless he perpe-
trated the said murder, and that in consequence of said threats he
did the act, of which he is charged. The traverse Jury acquit the
actual perpetrator, of the crime, and convict the person who procured
it to the committed by threats and menaces; and on motion in arrest
of judgment, the Court will be certain to discharge him. The 8th
section contains a provision similar to the foregoing, in favor of a
Slave, committing a crime under the coercion of his master, and is
liable to the same objections. The Common Law has sufficiently
provided for these cases, by making the instigators, accessories or
principals; and where there are mitigating circumstances in favor of
the actual perpetrator, they are the proper subjects of Executive
clemency.
As the act of 1828, and that of 1829, will be taken by you to your
room and may be referred to, I shall not trouble you with any further
remarks respecting them, unless specially required to do so on your
part.
There are some other subjects, of miscellaneous character, to which
I will now call your attention. There are several acts of the Council,
which, it is made the duty of the Court, to give you specially in charge.
The act to prevent duelling," provides that any person challenging
another, or the acceptor or bearer of a challenge, such person, or
persons, shall be incapable of holding any office of trust, or profit, in
this Territory. The second section, declares it to be murder, in the

party killing his antagonist in a duel, or inflicting such a wound, as
to cause his death, within three months; and his aiders, abettors and
counsellors, incur the same punishment, which is death. The 3d and
4th sections, are intended to put a stop to those violent affrays, and
public quarrels, which are so apt to terminate in duels. The person
assaulting another, with dangerous weapons, whose use is likely to
produce death, is declared guilty of felony, and is to be punished with
a fine not less than 500, nor more than 1000 dollars, and imprisonment,
not less than two, nor more than five years; and a person assaulting
another with a stick, cane, or whip, or other weapon, used for ignomin-
ious chastisement, his aiders, abetors, and counsellors, to be fined
not exceeding five hundred dollars, and imprisonment, at the discre-
tion of the Court, not exceeding two years. The 7th and last section
of this act, contains a provision of a somewhat questionable character,
it is that, which subjects persons fighting a duel out of the Territory,
to the same punishment, as if the act had been done in its jurisdiction,
provided the duel had been planned, and set on foot, within it. It
may be time enough, to examine this subject, when a case shall occur
to render that duty necessary.
At the same session, 1829, an act was passed to regulate interest,"
in which it is declared, it shall be the duty of the Grand Jury, “to
present all and every person, who may violate its provisions, that may
come within their knowledge, and on every such presentment, it shall
be the duty of the District Attorney, to have issue joined, or made
upon such presentment, and prosecute the same, under the rules and
regulations, prescribed for the prosecution of Qui Tam actions.” "
I must remark on this section of the Law, that the person who drew it,
could have had but an imperfect idea of a Qui Tam action, of the
official duties of the District Attorney, and of those of the Grand
Jury; or of the distinction between civil, and criminal proceedings.
Usury is not an indictable offence at common Law, nor is it made so
by the Statutes of the Territory; the subject, therefore, does not
properly belong to your duties—another section of the same Law,
provides that a Qui Tam action may be brought by any person, in
the nature of an action of debt, for the penalty imposed by the Law.
How it is possible to make the presentment of the Grand Jury, the
foundation of a civil suit, according to the course of judicial pro-
ceedings, could be more easily explained by the framers of the Law,
than by the Court.

Ferries,” overseers of Roads are subjected to a fine of ten dollars, for
the neglect of the duties prescribed in that section; which sum is to
be recovered, by warrant from under the hand and seal, of a Justice
of the Peace, in the County. The latter part of this section imposes
some duty upon the Grand Jury, but it is expressed in very imperfect
language. It provides, “that it shall be the duty of the Grand Jury
of the County, from time, to time, to make presentments, or prefer
indictments to their Superior Courts, of such Roads, as they shall
find out of repair.” That is, the Roads are to be indicted! How
these Roards are to be punished, is not declared; if by riding over them,
it is the traveller who suffers. It is not declared that the overseer,
or any other person, shall be subject to indictment for neglecting to
repair them. This is probably nothing more than a careless inaccuracy
of language; but in a degree scarcely inferior to the case of a County
Solicitor, in a State not fair distant, who indicted a Bridge, for an
assault and battery committed upon a Horse, who unfortunately fell
thro' it.
An Act past at the last Session of the Legislative Council, makes it
the duty of the several prosecuting Attorneys in this Territory, before
presenting Bills of indictment to the Grand Jury, to require a prose-
cutor, whose name shall be endorsed on the back of the indictment.—
This act seemed at first, to present such a serious obstacle, as almost
to defeat the administration of criminal justice, especially in the higher
offences. It might have been judicious, to have left it with the Grand
Jury to require a prosecutor, to be responsible for costs, where in their
opinion, the prosecution was frivolous. In some of the States, in
cases of assault and battery, and minor offences, where the party
aggrieved, is more seriously interested, than the community at large,
it has been deemed expedient, to require a prosecutor. But in no
State, as far as I am acquainted, has a prosecutor been required, in
cases of murder, robbery, arson, and others, of a nature, where the
safety of society itself, demands thier punishment. According to the
Law just referred to, it would seem at first blush, that no indictment
could be found, no matter what might be the nature of the effence,
unless some individual presented himself as the public accuser; and
which few persons are willing to do. The consequence might have
been a failure of justice; but considering that an indictment, presented
by the prosecuting Attorney, was only a mode of bringing forward the

accusation, which might also originate with the Grand Jury, them-
selves, I have narrowed the construction of this Law, to its letter.
I have, therefore, uniformly directed the Grand Jury, when no one
was willing to endorse his name upon the indictment, to return a
presentment in form, which may be drawn up by the District At-
torney, at their request, and signed by him, after being returned into
Court.
There is a subject of no little delicacy, to which I deem it my duty
to call your attention. During the last summer, very serious alarm
has prevailed throughout the greater part of the Southern States;
and although I hope greatly exaggerated, yet sufficient to cause deep
reflection. This community has not been entirely exempt, and the
same causes exist here. Our Legislation upon this subject, has prob-
ably made sufficient provision; but, there is still room for much to
be done, in the vigilant execution of the Laws. There is perhaps,
still more to be done, by the prudence and precaution of the individ-
uals, who are interested. The cause of humanity requires it, as well
to themselves and their families, as to the Slave who may be deluded,
to his own certain destruction. Without increasing the rigor and
severity, inseparable from a state of servitude, the dangers which
attend it, may be averted, by timely vigilance and attention. The
circulation of inflammitory publications, which have been thrown
into the Southern Country, by incendiaries, actuated by fanatic zeal,
which knows not the mischief it occasions, cannot be too severely
reprobated. The public assemblages of Slaves, in unusual numbers,
for whatever purpose, ought to be discouraged, as it affords them an
opportunity to commune with each other, and to form a mistaken
idea of their strength. The unrestrained association of free People
of Color, among the Slaves, ought to be discountenanced.
GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY; in conclusion, I will again remind
you of the nature of the high and important duties, you are called
upon to perform. Chosen from among the most distinguished of
your County, for intelligence, respectability, and wealth you may be
reguarded, as placed at the very foundation of social order. There
can be nothing more delightful, in the sight of God and man, than a
well governed, and well regulated community. Where violence and
crimes are repressed; where peace dwells in its borders, and where
SAFETY TO PERSON, PROPERTY, AND REPUTATION, ARE SECURED TO ITS

MAGNOLIA 1 Jany 1832
SIR I have now the honour to report the progress of the work
under my charge (the removal of obstructions in the river and har-
bour of St Marks) for the month ending yesterday. In my last
monthly report I stated to the Eng" Dpt. that the dredging oppera-
tions had not commenced,” On the 8th of Dcbr we had so far com-
pleted the machinery and flats as to allow their removal to the ob-
structions in the harbour. Beleiveing the improvement of the
“Devils Elbow” the most critical and difficult part of the work
(which I thought had better be undertaken by Lieut Long when he
arrived although I had full confidence in the success of my on plan

to improve this point) I commenced the opperations at the first
obstructions above. The Machine has been found defective in its
construction although the plan of it is good. It has scarcely power
enough, and many of its parts too slender. but by attending promptly
to its wants we are enabled to keep it in motion and in time hope to
get it in complete order. Up to the time mentioned above, we have
removed 220 cubic yards of mud and shells. I thought it adviseable
not to complete the 2nd relieveing lighter. The short distance which
the mud is carried and the quickness of its discharge will fully em-
ploy the machine to keep one in motion. The timbers are ready for
the second should it be required ”

J W SIMONTON Secretary
F. A. BROWNE Chairman
To the Hon: Senate & House of Representatives of the U States
In behalf of the Citizens of Monroe County, and as their Committee
appointed for that purpose, we beg leave to make known to you their
wants and wishes in relation to the establishment, of certain and
regular mail communication with the main land
Much the greater part of this County consists of Islands, scattered
in various groups and clusters, from Cape Florida to the Dry Tortugas
The principal port and business place is Key-West.—Here reside
the Officers, and here are held the sittings of the Superior Court, and
Court of Admiralty, for the Southern Judicial District of the Terri-
tory.—
It is a Military Post—and the Custom House of the District is
located here.
We consider that these establishments alone are of sufficient con-
sequence to the General Government, to call for the institution of a
Mail route to this place
We are aware that correspondence per mail between the Depart-
ments and the Agents and Officers in their employ does not generally
speaking increace the revenue of the Post Office—
But we are equally aware, that the Nature and Spirit of our Gov-
ernment, not only justifies but demands, the carrying into effect, of
any and all measures by which will be increased the welfare of the
whole—
The Committee learn by enquiring of the Officers and Agents of the
General Government now residing here, that no communication of
any kind from Washington, has reached one of them in the three
Months last preceding.
We do not pretend to estimate the injury sustained by the Govern-
ment,in consequence of this tardiness of communication, but we are
confident that no Officer or Agent, thus situated, can discharge his
duties profitably for the Government or satisfactorily to himself.—
The great increase of population, and the rapid augmentation and
great importance of Shipping and commercial transactions in this
section of the country fully warrants us, in asking of the General


## p. 626 (#642) ############################################

626 T E R R ITO RIA L PA P E R S
Government, the establishment of periodical and frequent mail com-
munication
At no place in the United States, is so large an amount of property
annually brought in, and submitted to legal adjudication and disposal
as in this
The rights and interests, especially of shippers, Owners, and Under-
writers, would be materially increased and advanced by the arrange-
ment asked for.
The protection and encouragement of commerce has ever been
considered by this Nation, as a matter of the highest moment.— We
fully concur in the opinion. And in asking the benefits of fixed and
frequent Mail intercourse, we only ask to share equally with our
fellow Citizens, in proportion to the interests we have at stake.—
Prospectively, much might be said in favor of our request— We
hope that the time is not far distant when an interchange of Mails
between the American and Spanish Post Offices will be negotiated
Whenever this is effected, Key West, will almost as a matter of course
form a part in the channel of communication.—
We believe that eventually this port, will become the general
rendezvous and depot for the United States squadron on duty, in
the West Indies, and Gulf of Mexico.—
But independent of this consideration no other place within the
Jurisdiction of the United States, offers equal facilities for ready and
speedy communication with our West India squadron, on an average,
a vessel sent from any of the usual stations, on the Northern side of
Cuba to Pensacola (now the point of communication) is absent six
weeks, whereas from the nearest of those stations, intercourse with
Key West, would under ordinary circumstances be completed in forty
eight hours; from the most remote, in less than five days. In the
existing state of things, we often suffer great inconveniances, from
the want of certain and direct intercourse, with Tallahassee, the seat
of Territorial Government.
Laws are enacted, promulgated, and in operation over fourteen
fiftenths of the Territory, long before the inhabitants of this County,
are even aware of their existance.—
Orders affecting our rights and interests, are issued by the func-
tionaries of the General and Territorial Governments of which we
are totally ignorant, until the time of benefiting by the privilidges
offered, or avoiding the evils threatened has past by-
It would doubtless be most for our conveniance to receive our
mails via Tallahassee. -
And we arrive at this conclusion more readily from having learned
that the Citizens of Tallahassee intend making an application to

SIR I herewith inclose you a monthly Report of the Operations
of improving the navigation of the Apalachicola river for the month
of Dec 1831 *—also a Qurterly return of machinery &c for the Quar-
ter ending 31* Dec 1831
The improvements of the river I consider completed, as far as
practicable, except about 40 miles of the upper part of it. In this
part there are yet many logs in the bed of the channel which aught
to be removed, and which could not be got at the past season from
the constant high stage of the water. For the purpose of finishing
this part of the work at some future period I have left the Machinery
&c necessary for it in the hands of Mr Raney Merch" Aspalaga-
The work in Dec. was a continuation of that of the preceding month,
clearing the falling-in banks of heavy timber & removing rafts of
drift wood &c from the channel on the upper part of the river *

CITIZENS OF JEFFERSON COUNTY
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:C*]
[January 18, 1832]
To the honorable James D Westcott Jun Secretary and acting Governor
of the Territory of Florida
The petition of the Subscribers Citizens of Jefferson County re-
spectfully sheweth, That your petitioners have and likely to suffer
great losses and inconvenience from the Indians roaming at large
within their precinct, contrary to an act of the Legislative Council
entitled “An Act to prevent Indians from roaming at large through
the Territory,” passed the 15" January 1827 and approved January
20* 1827." Your petitioners would shew to your honor, that a large
body of Indians are now on, or near the Aucilla encampted without
any possible means of subsistance, unless by destroying the game of
the Country, and pillaging from the Inhabitants thereof. That they
have already commenced their ravages among the stock owned by
your petitioners and in the open day, are your petitioners compelled
to witness the distruction of the small pittance they possess to support
their families in these hard times. Your petitioners are not disposed
to act before consulting with the proper authorities of the Land.
Tho: the law clothes them with power, they are not disposed to use
it, before taking good counsel, They look to you to see the laws carried
into execution, and are desirous that it should be done without trouble
or bloodshed. They therefore pray your honor to take the subject
under consideration, and forthwith to have these Indians removed
* Senate Journal, 22 Cong., 2 sess., p. 31.
* Ibid., p. 150. The bill was reported on Feb. 1. The act approved Mar. 2, 1833
(4 STAT. 645), provided $5,000 each for improving the navigation of the Och-
lockonee, Escambia, and Choctawhatchee Rivers. A letter from William L.
Haskins to Del. White, Magnolia, Jan. 23, 1832, urged an appropriation of
$4,000 to $5,000 for improving the Ochlockonee River (NA, SF, 22 Cong., 1
sess.).
* Wescott included this document in a message to the Legislative Council.
John K. Campbell forwarded the message with related documents to Del. White,
Feb. 8, 1832 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.). A cover endorsement states that
White transmitted the material to the Commanding General, Mar. 10, 1832
(not found), and suggested that it be placed in the Indian office.

Your petitioners before closing would respectfully shew to your
honor that the presence of the Indians amongst them opens a door
for the slave population to carry on a system of depredation which
unless stopped must inevitably lead to the impoverishment of your
petitioners, render the country unsafe, and not only the property but
the lives of your petitioners will be in continual jeopardy

SIR, In the frequent conversations I have had the honor to hold
with you on the subject of the interferance of Federal Officers in
popular elections you have always avowed a determination to turn
out any one who should be proved to be guilty—I now have the
honor to submit for your consideration three affidavits of most re-

Goverment have been offered to influence public sentiment in the
recent election in Florida—The Indian Agent John Phagan it appears
announced to a crowd of people that no one who voted for me should
be employed at the Agency, which was an indirect attempt to bribe
all who wanted employment to vote against me—To Capt Priest (at
present a member of the Legislative Council) he held out the idea
that the people of the Territory would not be protected by the Gen-
eral Goverment unless they voted for Col Gadsden—
To Mr Geo Downs a Justice of the peace he promised office for his
vote, & influence

At the last term of the Superior Court held in this County in May

the subject of the wanderings of the Indians from their territory among
the whites—upon which occasion, I asked him whether there was
any chance of redress for their disturbing the property of the whites:
I stated to him that they were often hunting amongst my cattle &
as I had reason to believe—occasionally killing one—and asked
him whether there was not some way to remedy the evil? He in a
very abrupt and apparently angry manner replied, “No Sir! but If
the people had voted as I wished them to, and elected Co Gadsden,
we could have had a fine troop of Horse-men stationed in the County
to scour the country & keep the Indians in Check” Surprised by his
language & indignant at the sentiments it conveyed I said with some
warmth: Has it then come to that Maj. Phagan, that the people
are not to expect protection, or what is necessary to their security
& interest because they prefer Col. White to Co Gadsden? Maj"
Phagan replied in an embarrassed manner “No Sir, no Sir, I didn’t
mean that, exactly, but if Col. Gadsden was in Congress I could ask
him for whatever I wished! but from Col White I will ask nothing”
disgusted & dissatisfied with what appeared to me a most gross insult

morialist was deputed by the Marshal of the Southern Judicial District
of the Territory of Florida, to take the census of the Inhabitants
comprising said District.—A very sparce population is to be found
in said District, which extends from Indian river inlet to Charlotte's
Harbour including the islands of Indian Key, Key West and the
Dry-Tortugas and innumerable little islands on the Florida Reef.—
In the discharge of this duty it became necessary and your memorialist
did employ a small schooner and two hands and was engaged sixty-
one days in the performance; having to perform a journey of near
fourteen hundred miles in the said schooner and in an open sea to
execute and perform the duty committed to his trust—Your memori-
alist would further state that the compensation allowed him by law
is only sixty-two dollars and four cents a sum totally inadequate to
the expense of the vessel and hands employed by your memorialist.—
Your memorialist believes the actual expense, the risk which he run,
(having to perform the duty during the sickly summer months) and
the value of time while employed are worth, in addition the sum
allowed Three hundred dollars; and he therefore prays that your
honorable body will grant to him such compensation as is just and
proper."—

DELEGATE WHITE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Seminole:ALS]
HO REPS Jan 23th 1832
SIR, I have the honor to enclose to you a letter of George Center
of East Florida, covering charges against the Indian Agent John
Phagan—I have been notified in various private letters of many of
the facts charged, and have reason to believe that they can, & will
be maintained if an opportunity is afforded of having them investi-
gated—
I solemnly believe that the history of no nation, or Country can
furnish a paralel of the fraud, oppression and inhumanity to which
the Florida Indians have been subjected—A part of them are now
endeavoring to hire an Interpreter to come at their own expence,
& lay their complaints before the President—These miserable people
are now reduced to the utmost extremeties for the neessaries of life,
indeed they have been in penury & wretchedness for years, & many
have perished from starvation—This is brought upon them by
combinations to decoy them into intoxication, the more effectually
to cheat and defraud them out of their property, & to paralize their
efforts to make a support so that new appropriations may be asked
only to be wasted—If you will order the agent and all this subordinate
agents out of the Nation, & send a Commissioner to treat with them
I am confident they will go west of the Mississippi, & become incor-
porated with the Creeks—If this course is not persued I will make
an effort in Congress to get a law providing for their removal"—
I have the honor to be Your Mo Obt Servant

[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 8]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, January 25, 1832.
TO THE HON” JosFPH M. WHITE, H. R. U. S.
SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 23rd in-
stant,” with the accompanying papers containing charges against
Major Phagan, the Indian Agent in Florida. The course indicated
in my letter of yesterday will be pursued in relation to these papers.”
I have understood from the President, that he has already men-
tioned to you his willingness to treat with the Florida Indians, for the
relinquishment of their present reservations, and for their removal
to the Country West of the Mississippi, whenever there is a proba-
bility, that a negotiation for those objects would be successful, as he
is indisposed to encounter the previous necessary expense, without an
intimation of this nature.” He has also so stated to Major Phagan,
with the view, that the latter might make inquiry immediately, and
report the result—If you have any information upon the subject, I
should be happy to receive it, and should it hold out a reasonable
prospect of success, measures shall be taken without delay, to effect
the removal of the Indians.
Very respectfully &c,
LEWIS CASS.

my commission has been forwarded to the Judge of the Superior
Court for this District, to be delivered over to me when I shall have
given the Official Bond required by law.—Shortly after the receipt
of your former notification of my appointment, Oct. 27" 1831,”
I was requested by a communication from the Comptroller of the
Treasury to furnish that Office with an Authenticated Transcript
of my Official Bond. I was then with the court on its circuit at a
distance from this place, I however immediately forwarded to that
Office a copy of my Bonds together with their approval by the Judge,
certified by the Clerk of the Superior Court for Duval County.—
But as the Marshals Bonds have usually been filed in the Clerks
Office at this place, I have, since my return, caused correct Tran-
scripts of my Bonds and their approval by the Judge, to be made
out and certified by the Clerk of the Superior Court at this place,
under the seal of said Court, the originals being filed in his Office,
which Transcripts I have also forwarded to the Comptrollers Office,
and presume they have been received some time since.—My Com-
mission from your Department inclosed to Judge Smith bearing dated
in October,” has been handed over to me, the conditions expressed
in your instructions to him having been complied with—The Com-
mission * of which you have done me the honor to notify me by the
last Mail has not yet reached his Office "—I was under the impression
that the Bonds into which I have already entered were sufficient
without being renewed, as the penalty expressed therein is obligatory
upon me and my security] during my continuance in office as Marshal.
If however I am mistaken, and it is necessary I should renew the Bonds
under the second Commission, I beg that I may be so advised; sug-
gesting at the same time that the Judge of this District is absent on
business at the North, and as the law requires his approval of such
Bonds, the time at which I may be enabled to forward them, depends
necessarily upon his return.—I must plead as an apology for being
thus particular, my solicitude to comply with all that may be required
of me by the Government—
I have the Honor to be very Respectfully, your obd" Serv"

take the liberty of forwarding the same to you & would add that from
an Examination of the quarters & barracks formerly occupied by the
Company under Command of Maj. Glassell at Camp King within two

quarters are somewhat out of repair & that it will require from $1200
to $1500 to repair the same that a small sum would place the large
building formerly occupied by the men in good repair.
There are individuals here who offer to deliver any articles of
provisions &c (at one doll prbbl advance on the N York price) at
the mouth of the Ocklawaha river on the St Johns from whence they
it might be transported at a small expense by water within two miles

it having been estimated that there are a larger proportion of slaves
than white persons owned by the citizens of said county residing within
30 miles of said Northern Boundary, and Whereas an armed force is
deemed requisite to protect the Citizens of said County from aggres-
sions by the Indians or attempts of an insurrection among the slaves,
in which case no assistance could readily be obtained from the two
Companies stationed at Cantonment Brooke Tampa Bay owing
th there being 112 miles distant from said Northern Boundary &100

Therefore Be it Resolved that a Committee of three be appointed
to draft a Memorial to the President of the United States respectfully

from Cantonment Brooke or some other station to Camp King near
the Seminole Indian Agency.”

[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 3]
HON. JONATHAN HUNT House of Rep"
SIR:
26th January 1832
In reply to your enquiries under the enclosed resolution,” I
have the honor to state that this Office is not apprised of any good
reasons why Mess" Floyd and Allen late Commissioners on private
land claims in East Florida are entitled to receive any compensation
in addition to that already received by them agreeably to law—
In reference to that portion of the resolution the Subject of the
expediency of paying the Registers and Receivers of the public land
Offices a fixed Salary in lieu of the compensation now allowed by
law, and concerning which you ask my opinion, I have to remark that
the present mode of compensation, viz: a fixed salary of five hundred
dollars per annum, and a Commission of one per cent on monies re-
ceived, restricting the Commission to a minimum of $2500, as pro-
* A Representative in Congress from Vermont.
* The first part of this resolution, Jan. 6, 1832 (House Journal, 22 Cong., 1
sess., p. 159), directed the Committee on Public Lands to enquire re compensation
for Floyd and Allen for the time from the expiration of their legal commission
until they delivered the papers to the register and receiver.

vided for by the Act of 20th April 1818,” has been found to be salu-
tary in its operation, as affording a compensation in proportion to the
amount of work to be done, and therefore doing away all claims for
Clerk hire, when there is an unusual press of work—
In reference to the third enquiry under the Resolution and con-
cerning which you request my opinion, I have to remark, that I do
not conceive that the time has yet arrived when it would be expedient
to reduce the number of Land Offices and consolidate the Land
districts—
The Land Offices generally are now more profitable than they have
been for any period since their establishment, and it is beleived
that to reduce their number would cause a diminution in the Sales
to an amount at least equal to, if not far exceeding any gain to the
government by such a measure, by reason of diminishing of the
facilities which now exist in making entries of government lands.
As it must be expected that individual emigrants will prefer pur-
chasing at an advance of those who have purchased of the govern-
ment, to incurring the increased expense and trouble in traveling
to the Land Offices if in so doing they calculate that their expenses
will equal if not exceed the advance they have to pay to individuals
on the government price.
The Resolution and Mr Floyd’s letter * are herewith returned.
I am, very respectfully Sir, your obt. servt.

the above reason for the period from Jan. 1, 1826 to Feb. 8, 1827; with the petition
there is also a letter from Gov. DuVal to W. H. Allen, Mar. 20, 1832, vouching

the trial of any claims to land within my District which had been or

but were still deposited in the offices in Cuba.
The cases in our Court were accordingly continued from time to

particular solicitation of our Judge I take the liberty Sir of requesting
that I may be favoured with the further views of your department
on the subject and whether the hope is still entertained of the ultimate

White Delegate from Florida and George Cent [MS. torn] late an
Indian trader in the Seminole nation *—[MS. torn]ng my answer you
will find the certificates of [MS. torn]our Duvalle and M Winslett
which will explain in some degree the malignant feelings in which the
charges against me originated. I was not advised of the existance of
the charges perfered against me untill after my arrival at this place.
Therefore I am not prepared with all the testimony which I can pro-
duce in justification of my conduct as an officer of the Government.
Most of the persons acquainted with the transactions of my official
conduct reside in Florida M Winslett whose certificate I have pro-
duced is one of the persons named by my accusers to prove the truth
of the charges he is in the City and may be examined should the
department think proper to do so."
Should the department think my answer with the certificates not
sufficient to justify my conduct, I can at a future period produce
satisfactory proof and explanation which I believe will relieve me from
the imputation of any improper conduct whatever. It will therefore
rest with the department to say whether a futher investigation shall
be entered into "

Since my arrival in the City, I have been confined by severe in-
disposition from which I have not yet recovered. Every moment of
my time when able to labour sinc my arrival has been devoted to the
preparation of my response to the charges which have been exhibited
against me-
The Committee, will see that the charges are of a character to re-
quire an investigation of my whole conduct as Governor of Florida
and Sup" of In" Affairs from the time of my appointment in the year
1822 untill the present moment, which will necessarily impose upon
me the labour of recuring to all the accounts vouchers, letters &c
which relate to the charges
Many of the charges relate to transactions in Florida—to which I
wish to oppose the testimony of respectable men two of whom are now
in this city in the employment of the Government and are required by
the Executive, as I am informed to repair to Florida on important
and pressing buisness I mean Gen' James Gadsden and John Phagan

what coure would be most acceptable to the committee, by which I
may avail myself of the benefit of the testimony of the persons refered

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[NA:SF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:DS *]
[February 10, 1832]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America.
The Memorial of the Legislative Council of Florida, respectfully
Sheweth, That at their present Session, in pursuance of an Act of
Congress," they have incorporated a Company to connect the waters
of the Appalachicola and Chipola Rivers with the Bay of St Andrews."
The importance of this Subject to the people of this Territory, and
to the South generally will be estimated by reference to the character
of the great Streams thus proposed to be united.—
The Appalachicola is one of the finest and largest Streams of the
South, having as its tributaries the rivers Flint and Chattachouchee,
both Considerable & extending to a great distance Northwardly,
and having on their banks, even now, a respectable and thriving
population.—
To afford a Suitable outlet to the produce raised on these Rivers
and to Supply the defects in the navigation of the Bay of Appala-
chicola is the object of the proposed Canal.
The Complete adaption of the Bay of S*Andrews to these purposes
is acknowledged by all who have Seen it, and will appear more evident
from a letter addressed to a member of the Council, which from the
character of its author, and his Known ability in the Service, is entitled
to great credit. We think we are not mistaken in Saying, that it

Journal, 21 Cong., 1 sess., p. 101), asking the confirmation of the incorporation
of the Chipola Canal Co. and introduced the subject again on Dec. 31, 1830

presents a better account of that Bay than has ever been Submitted
to the Public. The practicability of the Canal for a Small Sum in
Comparison with the magnitude & importance of the work, will
appear by the report of the Same gentleman, based upon actual
Survey, which likewise accompanies this Memorial.”—
We hope that it requires no argument to prove, that the United
States are also deeply interested in the Success of this measure;
they have already expressed that interest by the attention paid to
applications made for permission to Cut it, and by their directions
in their first act of Legislation on the Subject, that it Should be
Constructed So as to form a link in the grand chain of communication
Contemplated along the Gulf of Mexico:—
By a provision that officers and others engaged on business of
the United States Should be exempt from toll, which was obviously
intended with a view to the transportation of troops and munitions
of war on the Canal, and which is Strictly Secured in the charter
of this Session, they have further expressed their wishes as to its
Success.
There is however no difference of opinion as to the practicability
of this Canal, its usefulness, and the necessity of its Construction.
Whilst its importance is felt & acknowledged on all hands, and
has created a warm and Zealous feeling in its behalf, it is feared
that individual exertion will be unequal to the task, unless aided
by the munificence of the General Government.
We trust we do not mistake in appealing to the generous Course
that has ever been pursued by Government in advancing works of
this Kind—
We do trust that our appeal on a Subject of Such engrossing and
vital interest to our Country will not be ineffectual—
Resolved therefore, that our Delegate in Congress be, and he is
hereby requested to use his exertions to procure from Congress a
grant of land in aid of the Chipola and S*Andrews Canal Company,
Be it further resolved, That our Said delegate be requested to use
his further exertions to procure a Subscription of Stock from Congress
to Said Company.—
Be it further resolved, that a Copy of this memorial, & resolutions,

by Gadsden based on this report and submitted to White, Jan. 24, 1832 (loc.

[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:AC1")
[February 11, 1832]
Whereas the population and wealth of the Territory of Florida, do,
in the estimation of this Legislative Council, entitle her to benefits
equal to those which have been conferred upon other Territories;
and Whereas this Legislative Council are well satisfied that their
Legislation would be much more perfect and more conducive to the
welfare of the people of Florida, if she had another Legislative Body;
Be it therefore resolved by the Legislative Council of the Territory
of Florida, that our Delegate in congress be and he is hereby requested
to use his best endeavours to procure the passage of a law organizing
the legislative power of this Territory in the manner in which that of
the Territory of Arkansas is organized."
Be it further resolved, That the Acting Governor transmit a copy
of this pre-amble and resolution to the Delegate in Congress.

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:DS is]
[February 12, 1832]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in
Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida
respectfully sheweth,
That the exigencies of a large portion of the People of this Terri-
tory, being those who reside in the Counties of Jackson, Franklin,
Fayette and Gadsden, call for the establishment by Congress of an
additional Judicial District to be composed of those Counties, and for
the appointment of another Judge, Attorney and Marshal to reside
within the limits of the said District. The three Counties first men-
tioned are now within the limits of the Western district of Florida.
Two of them Franklin & Fayette are newly created, the former from
parts of the Counties of Washington and Gadsden, and the latter
from Jackson.—
Such is the quantity of legal business accumulated in the Courts of
the Western District, that it is impossible for the Judge of that Dis-
trict to perform all the duty required of him, and hold the Courts re-
quired by the Legislative Council. Indeed from the local situation of
Appalachicola Bay, the difficulty of access to it and the nature of the
business to be determined there, a judge could not do justice to the
business at that place, and hold more than one or two Courts in
addition elsewhere.—
17 House Journal, 22 Cong., 1 sess., p. 422. Two other resolutions by the Legis-
lative Council were presented on Feb. 28: one, of Jan. 14, 1832, requested the
delegate to obtain a law authorizing the council to meet at other places than the
seat of government of the territory in cases of necessity, and the other, Feb. 10,
to obtain a change in the organic law for the territory so as to provide for biennial
sessions of the council for two-month periods instead of annual sessions in order to
curtail the quantity of legislation produced and to give the people time to become
acquainted with the laws. The foregoing resolutions, together with another pre-
sented on Feb. 20, 1832, relative to the procurement of a law giving to the council
the power to fix the time of holding the superior courts in all of the counties of
the territory, were referred to the Committee on the Territories, whence they
did not issue (ibid., pp. 389, 422,423; Fla., Terr., Legis. Council, Journal, 1832,
pp. 29, 98–99). The Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida was reor-
ganized by the act approved July 7, 1838 (5 Stat. 263), which provided for a two-
bodied chamber consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives.

Taking off these three Counties from his District, would leave the
Counties of Escambia, Walton and Washington as his district, the
duties of which would be less onerous & could be fulfilled faithfully.—
The County of Gadsden is at this time a portion of the Middle Dis-
trict of Florida. There are now depending in the Superior Court of
that County, many criminal, civil and Common law proceedings un-
determined, and with the most unwearied assiduity the Judge of the
Middle District is unable to determine all the cases before him in the
four Courts in his district, in one of which (Leon County) the Docket
is generally the largest in the Territory.
A large portion of the Country comprising the County of Gadsden
is covered by the claim of Forbes & C° and as that claim has been de-
pending in suit, the Land has not been yet offered for sale, or even
surveyed by the United States, and consequently that rapid settle-
ment of the Country which the quality of the land and its peculiar
advantages would have ensured, if it had been heretofore in the mar-
ket, has not taken place.
The same facts exist in relation to a large portion of Washington &
Franklin Counties which are covered by the claim of Innerrarrity.
The claims of Forbes & C° and of Innerarrity have both been deter-
mined by the Courts of this Territory to be invalid, and whether (as is
beleived) this decision will be confirmed by the Supreme Court of the
United States, or not, the lands in all three of the last mentioned
Counties, must soon be forced by the clamors of the settlers upon it,
into market.
The extensive and increasing cultivation of the lands in the upper
Country near the Rivers Appalachicola, Flint and Chattahoochee in
the States of Georgia and Alabama, and in this Territory, justifies the
assertion that in a few years a town must grow up at the mouth of the
former river, second in size and importance to none in the Southwest-
ern Country except New Orleans.
Situated as the Country is at that time, with all the obstacles to
settlement arising from its hitherto unsettled & uncertain title, and
the almost total want of organization, the insecurity of property and
of personal rights, owing to the difficulty of resort to Courts of Justice,
yet nearly one hundred and fifty houses and stores have been erected,
and it is estimated, that there are now deposited in store, cotton &
other products, the growth of the upper Country, to the amount of
two hundred & fifty thousand Dollars—
Many vessels are employed in carrying cotton and other products
from that port during the years in fact, it is beleived more than from
any other port in Florida. Cases have arisen, proper subjects for
suits in Admiralty, but owing to the difficulty of procuring process,
the rights of those interested, have been abandoned. The necessity

of an Admiralty or Maritime Court, to which parties can resort with-
out being compelled (if access is sought to the Judge of the Western
district) to travel three hundred and fifty miles, or if to the Judge of
the Middle District, nearly two hundred for process, must be manifest
we think to your Honorable bodies.—
Your Memorialists are aware, that the expences of establishing an
additional Court is an objection entitled to great weight, but they
trust that Congress, with a spirit of liberality will regard the interests
of the Community now suffering for want thereof, as of paramount
consequence: and they do not also hesitate to say, that they beleive
the interests of the General Government, in advancing the price of the
public domain, by removing any obstacles to their settlement, will be
promoted to a greater amount, than the expense of establishing and
supporting the Court.
And your Memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray.—

three to four feet water.
To the Citizens in this Section of Florida and also to those residing
in three of the South Eastern Counties of Alabama, this improve-
ment is of the first importance, as all their produce is at present
shipped from Appachicola, a place totally inaccessible by land—
In its whole course it runs through the lands of the Government

Individuals not amounting to one fortieth part of the whole, –This
Improvement would doubtless enhance the value of the property of

REPRESENTATION BY A PUBLIC MEETING OF CITIZENS
AT ST. AUGUSTINE
[NA:SF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:C]
SAINT AUGUSTINE—East Florida. [February 29, 1832]
At a public meeting of the citizens held pursuant to notice on
wednesday the 29* February 1832: Doctor Andrew Anderson was
called to the Chair and K. B. Gibbs appointed Secretary. The object
of the meeting having been explained by Doctor William H. Sim-
mons, and the meeting addressed by John Rodman Esqr.; the fol-
lowing preamble & resolutions were unanimously adopted.
Whereas information has been received from Washington that
certain individuals who signed the petition for the reappointment of
the Honorable Joseph L. Smith, have secretly and by private letters
to the President stated that the people of this District had no con-
fidence in him and did not wish for his reappointment, thereby at-
tempting to predjudice the President against Judge Smith and effect
his removal from office; in consequence of which misrepresentations
the President has it in contemplation to appoint another person in
his place.
Therefore Resolved; that the petition sent to the President by the
citizens of this District was a voluntary act on their part, uninfluenced
by any fear, and expressive of the high regard and esteem in which
they hold his character for Talent, Integrity, and Justice, and their
approbation of his Judicial course.
Resolved; that the feelings and sentiments of the people of this
district have been grossly misrepresented by those persons who by
secret and private communications have attempted to impress the

President with the belief that the people of East Florida have no
confidence in Judge Smith and did not wish for his reappointment;
and that we view with indignation the injustice of such an Extraor-
dinary and dishonorable attempt to ruin a valuable and meritorious
public Officer, and deprive the Territory of the useful services of one
who has, in his department, done so much to promote its prosperity.
Resolved; that we repose the highest confidence in the experience,
Talents, Integrity, Justice and impartiality of Judge Smith; that it
is the wish of the people of this District that he be retained as their
Judge; that his removal from Office will be received as a public griev-
ance and misfortune, and with feelings of deep regret and disap-
pointment, as the interests of the people and the Territory will nec-
essarily sustain the most serious predjudice by a change of the
Judiciary.
Resolved; that a certified copy of these proceedings be forthwith
forwarded to our Delegate in Congress and that he be requested to
submit them to the President.
Resolved; that the proceedings of this meeting be published in the

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL34
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:C]
[February 1832]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
The Memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida,
respectfully shews; that Common humanity unites withe the general
policy of the Government in calling loudly for the removal of the
Indians, located within the limits of this Territory, to the Westward
of the Mississippi. The Treaty of 1823* deprived them of their cul-
tivated fields and of a region of country fruitful of game, and has
placed them on a wilderness, where the earth yields no corn, and where
even the precarious advantages of the chase are in a great measure
denied them. The only part of the land, that has been allotted to the
Indians on the Peninsula, which is at all susceptible of Cultivation,
is the heavily timbered hammocks with which Florida abounds. The
characteristic improvidence of the Indians, forbids the hope that they
will ever subdue these hammocks: and they are thus left the wretched
alternative of Starving within their limits, or roaming among the
whites, to prey upon their cattle. Many in the Nation, it seems,
annually die of Starvation; but as might be expected, the much greater
proportion of those who are threatened with want, leave their bound-
aries in pursuit of the means of subsistence, and between these and
the white settlers is kept up an unceasing contest.
Your Memorialists beg leave to call the attention of your honorable
body to the accompanying Copy of a communication from the acting
Governor of Florida. It contains a Statement of facts, which your
Memorialists think cannot fail to excite the benevolence of the Govern-
ment in behalf of this miserable remnant of the savage tribes of
Florida.
Your Memorialists are informed that all that portion of the Indians
who are located on the Peninsula, are willing to remove, provided their
Cheifs can be assured of being supplied at their new home with as
many cattle and hogs as they own at present. Indeed there can be no
doubt, that such have been their sufferings within the last four or five
years, that they would now prefer any change to their present con-
dition.
Your Memorialists would therefore respectfully pray your honor-
able body, to make an appropriation adequate to the expense of re-

moving these Indians, and the purchase for them, of a stock of Cattle

And your Memorialists &C.
On behalf of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida
A. BELLAMY President
[Endorsed] Copy of Memorial.
[Enclosure]
Acting Governor Westcott to Abraham Bellamy
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE Feb 2nd. 1832.
SIR, The resolution of the Council of the 23rd ultimo, requested
me to furnish “such information as I might have shewing the means
of subsistence and the present condition of the Florida Indians.”
There are within this territory, between four and five thousand of this
population. Of these perhaps 1/5th reside on the Appalachicola river,
and the residue on the peninsula. An annuity of $5000 is paid to
them by the U. S. under the treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1823. Of
this sum $1000 is paid to the Appalachicola towns and the remainder
to the Seminoles. This annuity is to continue for twenty years after
the date of the treaty. By it the U.S. were bound to establish a school
at the Agency, but it has not been kept for several years owing I have
understood, to the opposition of the Indians to it. The Appalachi-
cola indians are perhaps some what better off than the others. Five
or six chiefs on the Apalachicola are possess'd of considerable prop-
erty in lands reserved to them by the treaty and in stock; and some
few negroes are owned amongst them. There is considerable im-
proved land on some of these reservations which is rented to Whites.
The common indians are however very drunken, lazy and worthless,
and indeed none of their chiefs are entirely exempt from these vices.
In the distribution of the Annuity, some ten or fifteen of the head
chiefs of both divisions, receive from $20 to $70 each, the lesser chiefs
from $5 to $20, and the common indians generally between $3 and $4.
This distribution is I have no doubt equitably and properly made.
The money is however of but little service to the indians. Very few
are in any wise provident, and the money is generally kept by them
but a few hours or at most but a few days. About one half of the
able bodied men are possessed of a rifle or gun but their arms are
generally of little value. Those on the Appalachicola, living in the
vicinity of numerous settlements of whites can readily sell their game
and skins but the facility for sale is not so great nor the price paid as
fair in the Seminole nation. The poorest Apalachicola indians when
their corn is exhausted which is generally the case in Feb’ or March are

dependant on their Chiefs or are obliged to have recourse to hunting
or working for the whites, to procure a subsistence. When there is
scarcity among the Seminoles the most indigent are driven to the
coonty or briar root, the sour orange, and other wild productions
of the Peninsula; but it has been stated and I do not doubt that every
year many of these miserable creatures actually perish for want of
proper sustenance! Many who do not go down towards the capes
for the coonty, wander out of the bounds of the reserve and through-
out the country in large parties under the pretence of hunting. The
region between the Oscilla and Suwannee, and between the Suwannee
and the St: Johns, and beyond the St: Johns towards the Atlantic
is on these occasions overrun by them and large companies have en-
camped within twenty miles of this City. When they are near the
white settlements they create great alarm and disquiet. If drunk
they are often insolent and ungovernable. The white settlers own
thousands of cattle hogs &" running at large in the extensive ranges
over which the indians roam, and upon this stock great depredations
are committed. Detection of the guilty Indian, is almost impossible,
and if detected no satisfactory redress is afforded to the owner of the
stock stolen or killed. Nor is this the Only evil. They set fire to the
woods, fences are burnt, and the safety of houses jeopardized. In
some instances corn fields have been plundered and even personal
outrage committed. The fisheries on the coast afford them some aid.
I have recently been informed that some twenty or thirty Seminoles
are employed as fishermen and sailors on board the spanish fishing
vessels frequenting our coasts and which supply the fish markets of
Havanna and Matanzas. One half of the corn necessary for the Semi-
noles is not raised by them. They have not much land in cultivation,
and they will not devote any great attention to agriculture. A more
vagabond race do not exist on the face of the earth than the lower class
of the Seminoles. Every year by this time their corn is gone and
until the new crop in June or July, they go half starved. There are
it is estimated three or four hundred negroes among the nation. A
few are owned by indians to whom they are of no value, but many are
runaways from Georgia or Florida, and a very limited number are free.
Those negroes have great influence over them and in fact it is said
control their chiefs and councils. Very few of the lower chiefs are
possessed of property to any amount; and compared to what should
be the case, but little stock is reared or owned amongst them. As
these indians are now situated I am satisfied the attempt to keep
them within the boundaries of the reserve will be useless unless they
are furnished with the means of subsistence while there. They are
driven from it by dire necessity. Their roaming at large has been
attributed to the absence of the agent, but his presence would not

restrain them. All efforts to restrict them for the last three winters
have been ineffectual. It is due to the Agent to state that he is now
away by permission of the Superintendant and will speedily return
as soon as official business with the government which I am informed
called him to Washington, is completed. When he left the Territory
Mr. Sheffield the Sub-Agent” was here but had he not been pre-
vented by sickness would have gone down to the Agency forthwith.
He left this city for that purpose last week, but has I am informed
been taken dangerously ill on the road.
The only hope for any good in regard to this fallen and degraded
remnant of a people once high spirited and of noble character, is
founded upon their removal at an early period to the southwest of
Arkansas, separating them from the negroes now amongst them, and
keeping them from all intercourse or association with the whites. If
they remain in Florida they will continue in the same distressed situ-
ation and when their annuity ceases, eleven years hence, their wretch-
edness will be complete. Difficulties are also to be apprehended be-
tween them and the white population near them. Excited by their
continued depredations and outrages, the latter are now restrained
with difficulty from using the severest measures; and if hostilities once
break out, the feeling held towards the indians is such, that it is to be
feared they would cease only with their extermination! But if the
humane efforts the general government are now using, in regard to
the other tribes this side of the Mississippi, were extended to these,
and their removal and settlement effected; and proper laws made for
their regulation and protection; there is room for hope, that they
would become a new people, recover their ancient spirit, cast off their
vices, and avoid the certain fate of total extinction which inevitably
awaits them in Florida.
Sundry documents are transmitted to the house containing the data
upon which some of the foregoing observations are made, and also
letters and memorials throwing light on this subject.
I am respectfully Y. Obt Serv" -

ACTING GOVERNOR WESTCOTT TO THE SECRETARY OF
THE TREASURY
[FSL:FL.A., Gov. Exec. Corr.:M*]
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE March 10th 1832.
SIR. On the 6th of Nov' last I addressed a letter to the register of
the Treasury" in which I mentioned the sum of $7500 as the estimate
for the appropriation for 1832 “for compensation & mileage of the
members of the Legislative Council, pay of officers & servants of the
Council fuel stationary printing and distribution of the laws &c”
exclusive of certain items for arrearages—compilation of Laws &c.
In that letter I specially referred to some additional expenses that it
would become necessary to incur for new furniture for the Council
but I thought I made the estimate large enough not only to cover
all the expenses but that it was rather liberal. I wished if possible
that the appropriation should not be exceeded as it has been for
several years past. The result has proved that I judged erroneously.
A statement which I now enclose to you of the accounts certified and
to be certified, (which I have not until to day been able to ascertain
precisely) and which are payable at the U. S. Treasury & out of s”
appropriation shows an excess of $[blank] beyond it. The Governor
of this Territory possesses little power to regulate most of the charges
against this appropriation. The Council claims and exercises the
power of electing as many Clerks and other officers as they please and
of allowing them what they choose. The Statement shows the
number they appointed this year and the amount allowed to each.
The excess is greatly attributable to the employment of such a liberal
number of clerks and the liberal allowances to them. A considerable
number of laws more than usual were however passed this year and
very many more brought forward & considered which also of course
increased the expenditures. The charges for miscellaneous printing
[$452] exceeds the amount paid last year more than $300.
A reference to page 120 of the Journals of the Council & to page 148
of the laws (transmitted herewith) will show that the “compensation
bill” was vetoed on the ground of the allowances it made being too
liberal & because together with the other necessary expenses not
included in it would occasion the appropriation to be exceeded. It
however became a law by the requisite majority of the Council.
I trust it will not be regarded as officious or obtrusive to suggest
that in order to prevent such improper excess in future, that hereafter
the Act of Congress making the appropriation shall allow a specific

sum for each item of expenses, according to the items of the estimate
which when called for next fall will be carefully framed with such
view, and (as the app" law does not generally pass Congress till after
the Session of the Council is over and all the expenses incurred) and
that on the receipt of the estimate of the Executive of florida a com-
munication which he may lay before the Council at the opening of
the Session be addressed to him in which the various items of the
appropriation asked for shall be particularly enumerated, and also
express instructions given not to certify any accounts beyond the
allowances for each item of expense otherwise stated. This may
perhaps restrain the Legislature from incurring expenses exceeding
the appropriation, but no power possessed by the Governor alone can.
I regret the necessity of applying this application for an appropria-
tion of $[blank] to meet the dificit excess above stated. I cannot
however discover any course open at this time by which a deduction
of the accounts to bring the expenses within the appropriation could
be made or cause the loss to fall on them to whom the allowances have

occasioned by the witholding this appropriation are those most
entitled—by whom the amount paid is most dearly earned & upon
whom of all concerned no loss should fall. I trust an app" can be
obtained this Session.
I have written to Col. White the Delegate from Florida on this
subject and as I have made reference to this letter and its enclosure
I beg that it may be submitted to him

he should resign his appointment so soon as the establishment of the
Post office at the Post was carried into effect, as the proceeds of the
Office there at the Agency will not defray the expense of carrying the
mail from thence to Micanopi: therefore, I shall have to transport
the mail from the 1* of next month, the period when it is now con-
templated that this establishment shall go into effect, to and from
Micanopi, a distance of 26 miles beyond the Agency.
Since the lameness of the horse; kept in past performance of that

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:GAO, Misc. Treas. Accts., No. 60,675:LS*]
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE March 22. 1832.
SIR, In obedience to your directions I proceed to report to you the
engagements of the Government with Richard K. Call Esquire as
assistant counsel of the U. States. & the services rendered by him
in that character in order to enable you to fix his compensation
according to the act of Congress of May 23, 1828* S 11.—
In 1829 M’Call was employed as assistant counsel of the U. States
in the three following cases which were brought in the different district
Courts of the Territory of Florida.”
1. Arredondo & Son—vs—The U. States—claim for 289.645 acres—
2. Jn” Forbes & C*—vs—The U. States—claim for 1.500.000 acres—
3. Colin Mitchel—vs—The U. States—claim for 1.200.000 acres—
By M" Call's agreement with the then Secretary of the Treasury to
whom you referred the subject of his compensation he was to receive
* The reply, Apr. 18, authorized the purchase of one or more mules (NA, WD,
QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 17). See Thornton to the Quartermaster General, June
11, 1832 (loc. cit., Consolidated Corr. File), stating that he would make two horses
and one mule answer for the service.

$500 in each case for his services in the Territorial Court & $1000 in
each case in the Supreme Court where it was supposed that all of these
cases would be finally decided.
One of them was brought in the District Court for the Western
District of Florida—one in the middle District & one in the Eastern
District—In two of them the Judgment in the District Court was in
favor of the U. States, & in the case of Arredondo & Son the Judgment
was in favor of the claimant. The last mentioned case was tried at
the late Term of the Supreme Court & the judgment rendered against
the U. States in the District Court has been affirmed."—The case of
Mitchel against the U. States has been brought up to the Supreme
Court & is continued until the next Term. In the case of Forbes &
C° the fraudulent character of the grant under which the party claimed
was made so manifest on the trial in the District Court that the
claimants have not appealed & that dispute is now finally settled in
favor of the U. States.”
M. Call has received the compensation agreed on for his services in
the District Courts—and also one thousand dollars for the argument
of the case of Arredondo & Son in the Supreme Court.” But it ap-
pears to me that in addition to this sum of $1000, he is fairly entitled
to his expences in attending the Supreme Court at the present Term.
When his contract was made with the Government, he naturally
calculated that the three suits would all be brought to the Supreme
Court—& had a right to expect that they might all be tried at the
same Term, & that he would be required to make but one journey to
Washington in order to fulfil his engagements.—And if that had been
the case, the fees agreed on for his services in the Supreme Court would
have been an adequate remuneration without any allowance for his
travelling expenses—But unexpected and unforeseen occurrences will
subject him to the inconvenience & expence of three journies to Wash-
ington on this business—He attended at Jan Term 1831 but neither
of the cases were reached on the Docket. He has attended again at
the late term & one of the cases is tried & the other continued over
notwithstanding every exertion was made to bring on the trial—and
M" Call will be obliged to attend again at the next session of the Court.
Under these circumstances if he does not receive from the Government
his travelling expences, he will have but little left out of the fees above
mentioned for the services rendered to the public in the Supreme
Court.—And even with this additional allowance it will be seen that
his compensation is a very moderate one, when we take into consider-
ation the inconvenience & trouble of the journey & his long absence

from home & the consequent neglect for the time of his own business
& his other professional engagements.—Yet his services are too im-
portant to the Government to be dispensed with.—For his intimate
knowledge of all the facts in these complicated cases & his familiar
acquaintance with the Spanish laws & usages in relation to grants of
land in the Spanish colonies, render his aid in the argument here of
the highest value.
I understand that $500 will about cover the expences occasioned by
his attending the Supreme Court at the Term just past.—and I beg
leave respectfully to state that in my judgment he is justly entitled
to this allowance.
He was I understand allowed the expences of his stage fare when
he attended in 1831—and nothing more. But without proposing to
undo any thing heretofore decided on, I can perceive no reason for
limiting the allowance to that portion of his expences. For it is evi-
dent that if he receives the whole amount his compensation will be
greatly below what an individual would be willing to pay for the like
services in such a cause, where so much property is in controversy.
In February 1831 M" Call was by another contract engaged as
assistant counsel for the U. States in all other suits instituted in
Florida on land claims against the U. States."—No particular sum was
named as his compensation for these services, because neither the
Secretary of the Treasury nor himself knew enough of the business to
enable them to determine what would be just, & the amount was
therefore reserved for future decision.
It now appears by the Docket which I herewith submit to your in-
spection, that about one hundred suits have been brought against the
U. States in the different District Courts—some of them for large
tracts and each of them depending on their own peculiar circumstances
& consequently requiring a very careful & vigilant examination. The
distance of the places at which the different courts are held rendered
his services troublesome & expensive and the greater part of his time
for the last year must have been occupied by his attention to this
business.
The compensation for these services is yet unsettled & the amount
proper to be paid has not been decided on. If he were allowed such
fees as would be charged by counsel for the trial of each separate case
where individuals only were concerned it would amount to a larger
sum than the Government usually pays or ought to pay for services
of that description. It would therefore be more economical as well
as more consistent with the practice of the Government in analogous
* Some record of this contract may have been made in files of the Treasury
Department which were burned in 1833; none has been found elsewhere.

instances to compensate M. Call by an annual salary & this mode
would I have no doubt be satisfactory to him.—
In fixing his compensation in this manner it is proper to recur to
what has already been done in order to form a fair estimate of what
would be just to him & to the public.—The law agent in Florida
receives a salary of $1500 & with the usual allowances of office rent,
stationary & travelling expences he received in the last year altogether
$1691.—The services of counsel requiring learning & talents of another
order ought not I think to be graduated by the same scale with that
of an agent, but should be fixed with some reference to the ordinary
remuneration for professional services, where they are called for by
the Government or individuals. For by accepting the appointment
of Counsel for the public, he surrenders all the emoluments which he
might reasonably expect to receive from the individual claimants, if
he had remained at liberty to be engaged on their behalf. I therefore
respectfully suggest that a salary of $2500 would for the last year be a
reasonable & fair compensation for his services.—Yet I am convinced
that it is less than he would have received if he had refused to become
the counsel for the public & left himself at liberty to advocate the
claims.
I am aware that counsel fees in these disputed land claims amount
to a considerable sum and occasion this item in the expences of the
government to be much larger than usual. But the acts of Congress
authorizing these suits to be instituted against the U. States have
produced a new state of things & involved the Government in a mass
of litigation perfectly unexampled in its history—& which unavoidably
brings with it new & heavy expences.—As I have already stated
about one hundred suits are now depending in the three District
Courts of Florida involving property of great value. The claims are
advocated by able and eminent counsel & they must be defended on
the part of the U. States by competent talents, learning & vigilance—
otherwise the most valuable portion of the public domain may be
wrested from the public upon unfounded & unjust claims. As the
U. States have agreed to go into the courts as ordinary suitors they
must take the usual & appropriate measures to maintain their rights.
And in order to secure the services of competent counsel they must
incur the expences necessary for that purpose.—For it is evident that
the District Attorney standing alone could not do justice to the Gov-
ernment in such a multitude of cases pressing for trial.—I understand
nearly & perhaps all of these suits will be disposed of in the District
Courts during the present year–And if that should be the case & the
sum I have mentioned should be allowed to the assistant counsel for
the last & present year, the whole amount ought I think to be con-
sidered as a moderate compensation in so many suits, depending as

they are in three different courts distant from each other, & neces-
sarily therefore requiring & consuming the greater part of the time of
a professional man during the two years.—
I have taken the liberty of presenting these circumstances in order
to shew how it has happened that the claims for professional services
of this description against the Government exceed at this time the
ordinary amount. The additional expenditure has become unavoid-
able from the legislation of Congress in relation to these land claims.
The U. States are now Defendants in different Courts in a multitude
of cases—many of them involving property of great value. And from
what I have already seen I am convinced that the public will be de-
prived unjustly of a large portion of the national property unless
competent and vigilant counsel are engaged to vindicate its rights.—
And this aid the public cannot obtain unless it consents to pay a suffi-
cient compensation.—
In conclusion it is proper that I should call your attention to two
cases which I understand are now depending at Key West, each of
them for large quantities of land"—No assistant counsel has yet been
employed by the Government in these suits & I believe no particular
directions have been given for the defence. I submit whether some
measures may not be necessary to guard the rights of the public in
that quarter.”

greatly annoyed by the Semenole or Florida Indians; who are con-
stantly wandering from their own Country and trespassing upon the
property of the Whites: Their depredations upon our stock; are so
frequent and extensive, that we cannot for a moment, feel any thing
like Security, in relation to this description of our property & unless
Some measures are adopted by the Government to give us protection,
we see no alternative left, but to abandon the settlements we have
made at much expence & toil & retire to situation affording greater
safety & less troublesome neighbours. We apprehend that unless the
Indians are entirely removed from our Territory to some distant posi-
tion, the evil in view, can not be effectfully remedied. The wildness
& unsettled character of the frontier, (being in extent more than three
hundred miles) between the whites and Indians, afford much ample
facility for them to indulge their national disposition to wander, that
it will be next to impossible to confine them within their own Terri-
torial limits:—But where were it possible to restrain & keep them
at home, there is still to be found a most weighty objection to their
continuing to occupy, (as they now do) a tract of Country, within the
geographical boundaries, of of our Territory: in the fact, that abscond-
ing Slaves, find ready security among the Indians & such aid as is
amply sufficient, to enable them successfully to alude the best efforts
of their masters to recover them. It is believed that their are at this
time, fifty or more runaway negroes in the Indian nation, who have
taken refuge their since the treaty of 1823; * to whom the Indians
give protection, (in the way of secrecy at least) notwithstanding they
are in that treaty obligated by a solemn pledge to apprehend & sur-
render all Slaves who may seek shelter in their Country. So long as
a state of things thus dangerous to the interests of the inhabitants of
Florida continues she cannot hope for prosperity or improvement:
It cannot be expected that people of property will settle in a Country
where their is so little security in relation to their property. We
humbly pray therefore that your honourable body will take the matter
into consideration and award to us such relief as is in your opinion
necessary & proper.—
And in duty bound Your Memorialists will ever pray

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT
[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[March 26, 1832]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled—
The undersigned Citizens of the United States residing in the South-
ern district of Florida; Respectfully beg leave to call the attention of
your Honorable body to an Act of the Legislative Council of this
Territory passed at its last session entitled “An Act for the protection
of the Fisheries on the Coast of Florida and to raise a revenue there-
from''," and to ask that the same be annulled for the following
reaSOnS-
1* There are no fisheries on the Coast of Florida within the knowledge
of your Memorialists other than those which have been established and
are now in operation within the limits of this District—
2* Many of the persons engaged in those fisheries are foreigners
and so far as they are concerned the Act in question will operate as a
prohibition to the continuance of their business and as such, will do
much injury to the revenue of the United States and to the Citizens
of the District without affording the smallest benefit to any other class
of Citizens.—As a proof of this your Memorialists have only to say that
the persons engaged in this business within the last three years have
paid into the Treasury of the United States in the way of duties upon
Salt for curing their fish and for their supplies, and in charges upon
their vessels, nearly five thousand dollars, as will be seen by the returns
made to the proper department by the Collector of this Port; during
which time they have expended and still continue to expend much

money in the purchase of Salt and other Merchandize from the
Merchants here—
3* That so far as the provisions of the Bill relate to the American
vessels they will occasion much annoyance and embarrassment, inas-
much as nearly all of them are owned out of the Territory and it is
therefore inconvenient for said vessels to give the Bond required by
the Act—
4* That oftentimes the scarcity of seamen within the District is
so great that it is necessary to employ the seamen of foreign nations
for navigating the vessels sailing out of this Port and if but one such
should be employed on board any American Wessel—said vessel is
obliged by the Act to pay annually $500–“privilege money”—
5* That your Memorialists are of opinion that the regulating of
the Fisheries belongs to the General Government and that the Legis-
lative Council" of the Territory have not the authority to pass any
law operating as a restriction to the citizens of the United States
engaged in such business
6* That many of the Foreigners to whom the provisions of the
Bill more particularly relate were residents of the Territory long before
the change of Flags and have remained so to the present time——
Ignorance of the language being the cause of their not having become
Citizens of the United States
For these and other reasons that will be apparent to your Honorable
body in the features of the Bill Your Memorialists have presented
this petition and trust that their prayer will be granted—

of the Bill introduced into the House of Representatives on the 21"
Ult” entitled “a Bill making provision for the Sale and disposition of
the public grounds in the city of S*Augustine and Pensacola, and to
reserve certain lots and buildings for public purposes, and to provide
for their repair and preservation”—Your Memorialists refer especially
to the 3"Section of this bill as particularly objectionable and to them
wholly inxplicable but in one view of the subject—It is so decidedly
opposed to what they have always understood to be the Settled and
unvarying policy of your Honorable bodies in regard to the different
denominations of Christians in this Country, that they cannot but
fear its introduction has been procured by misinformation if not mis-
representation—Your Memorialists refer to this violation of the prin-
ciple, which they believe has ever governed your Honorable bodies
and which is involved in this Section, to abstain with sedulous care
from favoring one religious denomination to the exclusion of others
not from any supposed right on the part of your Memorialists to com-
plain of such legislation, if it should be deemed proper in the present
instance to adopt it; but simply that they may make it the occassion
and the apology for throwing themselves on your consideration in
regard to the provisions of the Section of Bill in question
Your Memorialists beg leave to state that a controversy in regard
to the title of the ground which is now used and which has for many
years past been used as a burial place for all protestants now exists
between the heads of the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches in
this City; and your memorialists have cause to apprehend that this
Section of the Bill has grown out of an unfair representation of the
facts connected with that controversy and the present situation of
the Common Burial ground—Your memorialists therefore respectfully
represent that the ground which is now used as the Burial place of all
protestants of this City was on the 14* January last conveyed to the
Trustees of the Presbyterian Church of this City to be held by them
In trust as a public Burying ground for the use of all protestants who
may be brought there for interment; as will appear by a copy of the
conveyance of one Thomas Alexander of the said premises herto
annexed marked A* and to which your memorialists respectfully
pray your Honorable bodies to refer—Your Memorialists beg further
to state that on the reception of this conveyance the Trustees of the
Presbyterian Church invited the heads of the Episcopal and Meth-
odist Churches in this City to unite with them in the fixing and
regulating such charges as might be supposed to be necessary or
proper for the maintenance of the burial ground in decent order;

that this evidence of a desire to cultivate peace and harmony was
wholly disregarded–
Without entering into the grounds on which the right of M Alex-
ander to make this conveyance is opposed and supported your Mem-
orialists merely state that it is denied by the heads of the Episcopal
Church and affirmed by those of the Presbyterian Church the burying
ground has recently been forcibly taken possession of by the Corpora-
tion of this City most unlawfully as your memorialists believe; but it
is now as it has always been open to the use of Protestants of all
denominations as will appear by the annexed documents marked B”
and to which your Honorable bodies are respectfully refered
Your Memorialists independent of all exception to the principle of
the 3" Section of this Bill and as Citizens of this place whose best
interests are essentially dependent on its prosperity beg leave to
represent that the appropriation of the Lot called “the old Dragoon
Barrack Lot” is particularly objectionable because of the locality of
this lot; that this lot is within the City Surrounded by others which
are occupied and contiguous to the most thickly settled part of the
town: That medical men here have given it as their opinion that this
lot cannot be used as a burial place with safety to the health of the
City; * and your memorialists believe that this opinion is sustained
by the great anxiety manifested at the present day in all parts of our
own country and in many parts of Europe to prevent the burial of the
dead within the limits of Cities—Your Memorialists would respectfully
add that the proposed appropriation of this particular lot for the
purpose referred to is viewed with disapprobation and regret by
almost the whole of this Community, as a measure which if carried
into effect cannot fail to be most detrimental to their best interests all
which is most respectfully submitted to the consideration and wisdom
of your Honorable bodies—
* These are resolutions of the Mayor and Aldermen, both dated Feb. 4, 1832;
one authorizing the mayor to take possession of the burial ground, and the other
notifying the trustees of the Presbyterian Church that any interference would
be regarded as an act of trespass and acted upon promptly. The City Corporation
did not recognize the claim by Thomas Alexander to the burial ground which had
been appropriated for that purpose by the Corporation in 1821.
* A letter from Thomas Douglas, who was a member of the Trinity Episcopal
Church, to Del. White, Mar. 14, 1832, expressed agreement with this view and
recommended the use of the old powder house lot, which lay to the northwest
away from any habitations, as a cemetery. He enclosed a resolution of wardens
and vestrymen of the church to that effect, Mar. 14, 1832. These documents are
also filed with the memorial.

I have in common with all my fellow Citizens in this Section of Florida
in the reappointment of Judge Webb whose term of service expires
on the 24" of May next—I have understood that considerable oppo-
sition has & will be made to his nomination, and that too by people
who have no interest whatever in the matter—
Judge Webb is extremely popular through out his district, not only
as a Judge but as a gentleman, and I Sincerely believe that if his re-
appointment depended upon the voice of the people with whom he
has resided nearly four years, two votes would not be recorded against
him 67– *
In consequence of using ef public money which was deposited in
his hands for Safe Keeping Judge Webb has been obliged to discharge
a man by the name of Yancy from the clerkship of his court—This
man left here yesterday in a clandestine manner and it is believed
that he has gone on to Washington for the purpose of injuring the
Judge—I have only to remark that he is worthless and no confidence
ought to be placed in him—
Permit me to call your attention to this subject and to use your
influence in favor of the reappointment of Judge Webb—Please

circumstances and for the last time, while they remain in their present

THE CHIEF OF ORDNANCE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:WD, CO Lets to WD, Bk. 5]
ORDNANCE OFFICE April 6–1832–
HON' LEWIS CASS Secretary of War
SIR—In answering the letter to the War Department, from General
R. K. Call of the 1 Brigade of the Florida Militia,” referred to this
Dept. wherein he has requested the issue of 1000 Stands of Arms
under the act of 1808.” for Arming and Equipping the Militia; I have
the honor to state.—
That the apportionment of Arms to the Militia of the States and
Territories under that act is made in the month of May in each year;
and is founded on the latest returns of the number of the Militia in
each State and Territory, as reported to the Adj. General of the Army
by the proper authority of the State or Territory; and as no return
of the Florida Militia has ever been made to the Office of the Adj"
Gen' of the army until the 8" of November 1831," no arms have
therefore been apportioned to the Militia of that Territory.—
The return here alluded to, give 827. as the number of Militia in
the Territory of Florida; and it is estimated that the apportionment
in May next, would give for this number about Ten Stands of Arms.—
But as 208, Stands were issued to the Territory on acct, in the years
1824" & 1826," it would appear to be indebted to the “appropriation
for Arming and Equipping the Militia” to the amot: of 198 Stands
Muskets.—

* A transmittal letter for this return from Isham G. Searcy to the Adjutant
General, Nov. 8, 1831, is in NA(WD, AGO Lets. Recd., S 195), but the return
has not been found.
* In response to a request made by Gov. DuVal to the Secretary of War,
June 7 and Sept. 2, 1823, the Chief of Ordnance informed him, Aug. 5 and Sept. 19,
1823 (NA, WD, CO Lets. Sent, Bk. 11), that since no returns had been received
from the Florida militia, no arms could be apportioned, but 100 arms could
be furnished on account of the quota which would be assigned to the Territory,
and he accordingly directed the shipment of 50 stands of arms and accoutrements
from the Frankford Arsenal, Philadelphia, Pa., to Pensacola and a like number to
St. Augustine. DuVal’s letters are referred to in Bomford's letters but have not
been found. Daniel E. Burch, the quartermaster officer at Pensacola, trans-
mitted, Feb. 4, 1824, the governor's receipt (not present) for the arms sent to
that place (NA, WD, CO Lets. Recd.; the Chief of Ordnance to Burch, Mar. 19,

not at this time want more than that amount, nor until new contracts

The resurveys on the Escambia, and its vicinity have not yet been
returned to this Office, but will be in a short time, after a laborious
resurvey of near five months by three experienced and persevereing
Surveyors, those surveys will require much labour and time, to pre-
pare them for the General Land Office, and the Registers Office, but
will be completed and forwarded as soon as practicable for it to be done.
There have been no new contracts entered into since the last fur-
nished you, as the Surveyors considered it a ruinous business to take
contracts under your last instructions bearing date the 23. September
1831.”—but it is probable, that some contracts may be taken under
your modified instructions of the 24th of October 1831.” received at
this Office on the 27th of February 1832.
The cause of my not forwarding sooner to the General Land Office,
the surveys made under the last contract furnished you was owing to
a severe and protracting illness that had confined me to my room since
the 14th day of July last, together with the occasional indisposition of
both of my clerks yesterday, was the first day I have been able to go
to my Office in nearly nine months, and I am now so feeble, I am
unable to do business, and both of the Clerks in my Office are sick
at this time. Mr Williams is very much indisposed indeed several of
the Deputies were likewise sick, which kept their returns out of the
Office much longer than was expected.
thus you will see, that causes beyond my controul, or others, have
retarded the progress of business in every branch of this Department.
You may rest assured, that so soon as circumstances within my
controul will Justify the completion of the surveys due the General
Land Office they will be forwarded without delay.

WILLIAM WIRT TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
[LC: Wirt Papers, Letter Book]
BALTIMORE. April 18" 1832.
SIR, In answer to your letter of yesterday I have the honor to
state that M Ringgold, the late District Attorney of Florida, was
detained in Washington the winter before the last at my request, & as
I understood, with the concurrence of the government. The circum-
stances were these. The President was anxious that the case of Colo.
Mitchell against the United States should, if possible, be argued and
decided at that term;—M Ringgold had, as District Attorney, tried
the cause in Florida, with the aid of Gen' Call & perhaps the law
agent.—He was, therefore, familiar with the cause, knew all that the
transcript of the record ought to contain, and whether certain original
papers, whose genuiness had been impeached in the Court below,
had been properly selected & Sent up. The transcript & documents
had not arrived until Some time, I think, after the commencement
of the term; nor had General Call, who had been retained to argue
the cause with me, arrived. The record, after it sh" come to hand,
would remain to be printed, & I had not the leisure to Superintend
the press. Under these circumstances I thought it the interest of the
government that M Ringgold should be detained to inspect the trans-
script & documents after they Should arrive & See that the cause
was Standing on the appeal as it had Stood in the Court below, to
Superintend the printing of the record, which was very voluminous,
and to aid me by his familiarity with all the points in the cause in the
Speedy preparation. I was expected to make for the immediate
argument. His detention w” have been unnecessary if Gen'Call had
been on the ground, but he had been delayed in setting out from
Tallihassee & retarded in his journey by the bad roads of the winter.
I had no interview with the Secretary of the treasury on the Subject
of M* R's detention.—M R however, told me, that he saw him
repeatedly, as well as the President, & that the course which I had
advised was approved. The record was printed under his Superin-
tendance on the part of the Government & Colo: White's, on the part
of Colin Mitchell, and M Ringgold remained until Gen'Call's arrival,
which was, I think, late in the Session. I thought it probable that I
had written to the Secretary of the Treasury as to the propriety of
M” R's detention—but I Suppose I must be mistaken as you Say that
there is nothing in the department concerning it. I remember that
I Saw M. Maxcy, the Solicitor of the treasury once, or oftener, on the
Subject of the cause:—perhaps it was to him that I wrote instead of
the Secretary & He will probably be able to recall the course of the
transaction. M R's Superintendance of the press can no doubt be

attested both by Colo: White & General Green, the printer Selected,
as I understood, by the goverment to print the record; and I know
that I had divers useful consultation's with Mr R on the various points
of the cause before the arrival of Gen' Call.
As Soon as the record was printed & ready for the court, we pressed
the argument of the cause. It was resisted by the then Attorney
General Mr Berrien, Colo: White & M Webster who were of consel
for the appellant, & the cause was continued at their instance. At
the last term the counsel on both Sides were ready for the hearing &
concurred in pressing it on the Court; but it was thought too late in
the term to take up & decide So important a cause on So voluminous
& complicated a record. These are all the facts within my recollec-
tion connected with the Subject of your inquiry.

recommending a grant of land in that Territory for the encouragement
of the growth of new and important agricultural products, exotic

& Report—
The plan and object of the Memorialist Dr Perrine are explained in
his petition hereto annexed and made a part of this Report (No 1)
Dr Perrine has been for some years the American Consul at Campeachy
and Tobasco, being a man of science and industry, he has devoted a
great portion of his time for the last four years in the Collection of the
most rare and valuable Tropical plants, medicinal shrubs Trees &

which they abound—From the testimonials exhibited to the com-

mittee they are satisfied that from the extensive acquaintance of this
gentleman in that Country, the high estimation in which he is held
by the public authorities of Mexico that he has it in his power to
obtain & import pertant to this Country the most useful and valuable
acquisitions to our National agriculture—
The Committee do not deem it necessary to offer any remark on the
subject of the practacability of such an enterprize—The history of the
world shews that in all ages & Countries Trees vegitables, grains &
plants have been successfully transplanted, & domesticated from one
country to another-Ha ette Gethtry where we have every variety ef
seil and elimate perhaps less has been dehe than in ahy ether in the
same tihae—As a general principle of action for the national legislature
it is better to abstain from any legislation upon such subjects leaving
them to individual enterprize and exertion—There are some cases
however in which it would be unwise and impolitick not to furnish
some facilities in aid of our enterprizing fellow Citizens—The Greeks
and Romans obtained at the public expence a number of grains,
vegitables & plants from Africa & all the modern States of Europe
have made it one of the leading considerations of National policy to
promote new acquisitions to the agriculture, as well as to the Com-
merce of the Country—
The U States have acquired eighteen or twenty millions of acres of
land by the late Treaty with Spain, now almost entirely uninhabited,
the largest portion of which is incaple of producing any article now
cultivated in the U States—This immense tract of land on the borders
of our Union must lie unemployed and useless for many years without
some experiment such as Dr Perrine proposes—The Committee have
therefore determined to report a Bill setting feeth apart for this
object one Township of the public lands to be granted to him & his
associates, upon condition of its occupancy & successful Cultivation-
The committe annex to this Report a number of documents & letters
explanatory of the object & shewing the importance of the proposed
experiment, numbered from 2 to 7–
The Committee also annex a Copy of the Treasury Circular to this
report No. 8. and Translations from a recent work on Cuba made by
the Delegate from Florida shewing the extent and value of the pro-
ductions of that Island and the great importance of the introduction of
the same articles as far as practicable into this Country."

Agriculture reported favorably on Feb. 17, 1838 (NA, loc. cit., printed op. cit.),
and submitted a bill which was enacted. The act approved July 7, 1838 (5 STAT.
302), granted Perrine a township of land at the southern extremity of Florida for
the cultivation of tropical plants. See Nelson Klose, “Dr. Henry Perrine,
Tropical Plant Enthusiast,” Fla. Hist. Quart., XXVII, 189–201. Perrine was
killed by Indians at Indian Key in 1840.
* DuVal was nominated for another term by President Jackson, Dec. 7, 1831
(Senate, Exec. Journal, IV, 177), the nomination being referred to the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary the next day (ibid., p. 185). The Committee con-

against the accusations before submitting its favorable report, Apr. 26, 1832

actions as governor and as superintendent of Indian affairs.

where the rock was too hard for the buckets to cut into it. These
hard places will require blasting to remove them."
The cut is 60 feet wide at the bottom and 100 feet at the top. Wessels
may now pass freely with 6 inches more water than in the old winding
channel.
Seven hundred cubic yards of Shells & stone has been removed dur-
ing the month; much less than the amount in the previous month,
which was occasioned by the giving way of the T head of the S. Engine
and the wheel that works the chain of buckets.
The work, from the time I took charge of it, may now be considered
as half completed in the harbour.
There will be full $2,500 left of the available funds for improving the
Harbour & River of St Marks after the harbour is completed, and I
would suggest the propriety of opening the natural bridges above Mag-
nolia and going on with the improvements of the river above them
agreeably to the plan given in my report of Feby 15" 1832” as soon
as it may be conveniently done, the following season. The boats and

SIR, It having appeared, by your letter of the 28" March 1830,"
addressed to this Dep" that there were many important papers, be-
longing to the Archives of Florida, retained in the different Depart-
ments of the Government of the Havana, the Minister of the United
States at Madrid was instructed to demand an order for the delivery
of all documents of that description.” That order has at length been
obtained, and M. Jeremiah Robinson, who will deliver you this, has
been commissioned to proceed to the Havana,” with the order, and
with instructions to our Consul to demand the delivery of the papers."
He will on his way, call on you to receive such information as may best
enable him to effect the object in view. I will thank you, therefore,

papers, to which we may be entitled; designating, as far as your knowl-

avoid the effect of it, unless we can specify particular documents, and
thus falsify any allegation they may make, that they have them not

SIR, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30"
ultimo reporting the progress made in improving the navigation of
the S' Marks River,” and stating that there will remain, after the
work in the lower part of the river is completed, a balance of about
$2500, which you recommend should be applied in opening a com-
munication through the Natural Bridge agreeably to the plan &
estimate submitted by you in February last. The additional amount
required to effect the object in view has to be obtained through the
action of Congress and as the improvement in question is deemed to
be new, not being embraced in the original project submitted for
improving the S" Marks river, it became necessary to refer it to the
delegate of the Territory in order that it should be brought up for
consideration as an original proposition, in such manner as he may
think best. You will therefore postpone making any arrangement in
relation to that improvement until you are further advised from this
Department.”

SIR You are aware that by the 10 Section of the Act of the 23 May.
1828 Entitled “An Act Supplementary to the several Acts providing
for the Settlement and Confirmation of private land Claims in Florida”
the President is Authorized to appoint a Law Agent,”—to Continue
him in place So long as the public interest requires his continuance,
and to allow such pay to the agent as he may think reasonable.—An
agent was accordingly appointed and has been so far compensated by
an Annual Salary fixed by the President. In that part of the General
Appropriation Act of the 5 May last which contains An Appropriation
for Compensation to Assistant Counsel and District Attornies under
the former Act it is provided “that nothing herein contained Shall be
So construed as to Authorize the payment of a Salary to the Law
Agent in Florida”” It is presumed, however, should the continued
services of the Agent be necessary that it will be competent for the
President to compensate him in such other mode as may be reasonable
and proper. With a view of bringing the subject before the President
I will thank you to favor the Department with any information in
your possession tending to shew the usefulness of such agent in the
present Stage of the Judicial proceedings in cases Arising under the
Act;—And the mode by which you would recommend the Agent to
be compensated in the event of its being deemed adviseable to Con-
tinue the office:—And the amount of such Compensation."

WASHINGTON May 30th 1832
THE HON" LEWIS CASS Secratary of War
Co" Gadsden having made a Treaty with, the principal part of the
Florida Indians,” it is necessary now to appoint another sub agent as
their is but one attached to my superintendency—
The Agent Majr. Phagan, will be much absent from his post for
several years to come first with the deputation of Indians who will go
to examine the country west of the Mississippi and afterwards with
the emigrating parties—I therefore recommend William Pope Esqr of
Florida as a proper person for sub agent”—I will suggest the propriety
of writing to the Indian Agents residing in the country where the depu-
tation under Majr. Phagan, are about to visit, to receive them in the
most hospitable manner and to render them as much satisfied with the
Indians under their controle as possible I know the Florida Indians
are under much apprehension from their countrymen in that quarter—
Co" Gadsden has informed me that the Indians desire to receive their
annuity before the deputation leaves home I request the annuity may
be remitted to the Agent, and that the check or draft may be drawn
on Charlston This would save time, trouble, and expence as it will
be more convenient for the Agent to receive the money at Charlston
than at New Orleans or Mobile

He had previously written on Apr. 3, 1832 (loc. cit.), that the planting season of the

have been granted to take testimony in Cuba (which cases the returns
will Shew) most of this testimony will be sought for at Havana, I will
forward you the names of the witnesses as Soon as I am furnished

the Seminole Indians in exploring the country West of the Mississippi."
Colonel Gadsden has recently concluded a treaty with these Indians
for the cession of their lands in Florida; * but the treaty is not obliga-
tory upon them, till a deputation, which they are to send, shall have
examined the country, to which it is proposed to remove them, and
reported favourably concerning it.
I think the estimate of Colonel Gadsden is low, excepting the com-
pensation proposed to be allowed to Major Phagan. Should he be
sent with the party as he is already in publick employment his ex-
penses, together with a small additional compensation, in considera-
tion of the change in the nature of his duties, are all, which should be
allowed. But as this duty may not be assigned to him, as Colonel
Gadsden has made no provision for the payment of an interpreter,
and as I doubt whether seventy five cents per day will procure “horses,
tents, interpreters, guides, blankets, clothing, camp apparatus” &"
I would suggest the propriety an appropriation for $3000, as recom-
mended by Colonel Gadsden—agreeing with him that this sum will
be necessary, but that it will not be necessary to make to the Indian
Agent the full allowance contemplated.
Colonel Gadsden has informed me, that the sum of five thousand
dollars asked for upon the application of the Florida Indians, to relieve
their wants will not be required for that object—I venture to suggest
therefore that the appropriation now asked be substituted for that.”

[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Apalachicola:ALS]
WASHINGTON D. C. 31 May—1832
SIR. The Indian reservations on the Applachicola river include in
all Sixteen sections or fractions of land, containing about 10.140 acres,
which at the minimum government price would be worth 12.675 dol-
lars—I entertain little doubt however, from the favourable location of
the two reservations occupied by Econchattemico, and Mulatto King,
and containing about 5120 acres of land, that they would readily
command at this time 4 dollars per acre, equal to 20.480 dollars, and
* The estimate, submitted May 30, 1832 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Seminole
Emig.), was for $2029 for the expenses of the deputation and $900 for the agent.
See Gadsden to the Secretary of War, June 2, 1832 (loc. cit., Treaty File), with
an explanation of the charges.

that Blunt & Tuskehajos', would probably bring half that amount
$10.240 making in all 30.720 dollars—
My impression is, from the conversations held with Blunt, the prin-
cipal chief on the Appalachicola, that 5000 dollars will be received for
his and TuskeHajos' reservations, and that 4000 dollars would prob-
ably purchase the land occupied by the other Chiefs, the Government
stipulating at the same time to pay for the cattle belonging to the
Indians on valuation, and to defray the cost of transportation to the
new country, with 12 months supply of provisions as provided for in
the several treaties of removal, and at a rate in money; which has been
ascertained, in the execution of those treaties, to be the expence of
removal, and the cost per ration to each Individual—An estimate
therefore to accomplish the object of removing the Indians in the Four
Towns from the Appalachicola river may be made thus—
Payment for reservations surrendered— $9000. —
Transportation of 600 Souls a $20 per head based on the
Cost of transportation of the Cherokees who are not as
remote from the New Country as the Florida Indians 12,000 —
Rations for 600 Persons for 12 months at 7% cents per
day—the present price of Indian rations 16.420.
Payment for 600 Head of Cattle a $4 2.400.
$39.820
Deduct probable amt cattle resold at public sale—$3 1. 800
$38, 020
The cattle taken at valuation & subsequently sold at public auction
may possibly involve a loss, by forcing so large a quantity into a limited
market—I have estimated this loss at 1 Dollar the Head; the amount
however will depend very much upon the Agent entrusted with the
sale *

SIR, In answer to your letter of the 18" of May last " I have the
honour to state, that under the act of March 2. 1831 * where lands
have been acquired by the U. States, according to the provisions of
that law no person has a right to cut or remove timber from such lands

to the land claimed is either acknowledged by the Government or
maintained by the judgment of the Court.—The person therefore who
cut & removed the timber for the purpose of building the vessel men-
tioned in your letter may be prosecuted under the 1* Section of the
act above mentioned. But the vessel built of the timber improperly
cut and carried away cannot be libelled under the 2* Section unless
she takes on board timber contrary to the provisions of that section.
In other words the vessel built of timber unlawfully taken from the
lands of the U. States would be liable to be proceeded against under
the second Section of the law in those cases only where the libel could
be sustained against any other vessel if employed in the like manner.

WILLIAM B. LEWIS Esq
SIR, The President having directed, that the accounts of Gov.
Duvall for his services & expenses should be opened & reconsidered,
I have accordingly taken up his claim,” & have allowed him five
dollars a day, to include his services & expenses, for the time charged
by him.
My view of this case is this. Gov. Duval is ex officio Superintendent
of Indian Affairs in Florida, & as such it is his duty to superintend &
direct the general operations of Indian Affairs. But he is under no
legal obligation to execute those specific & detailed duties relating to
Indian intercourse, which require the personal communication of the
officer with the Indians, in various parts of the country, unless partic-
ular provision is made therefor. If he were, the whole business of the
Indian Department might devolve upon him. And certainly, duties
of this kind are not fairly within the meaning of the word, “Super-
intend”, which implies rather a supervisory authority, than the
personal execution of details. I find no law, directing Gov. Duval to
investigate these questions about Slaves, & I do not think the duty
was one, which the law imposed upon him.
That the Department has heretofore taken this view is clear from
the fact, that this duty was at one time assigned to judge Smith.
If the law gave it to Gov. Duval, the Department could not, with any
propriety, give it to another.

DEPARTMENT OF WAR July 5, 1832
COL. JAMES GADSDEN
SIR, I have received & submitted to the President your letter of
May 31. 1832,” & I am now to communicate to you his views thereon.
He wishes you to Seek an interview with the Indians interested in
the reserves you described upon the Apalachicola river in Florida,
being sixteen Sections or fractions, containing about 10.140 acres.
There are no objections to the amount demanded $9000, for the value
of the land. But the other Sums required for the expenses of emigra-
tion & subsistence & for the payment of their cattle, amounting to
Twenty Six thousand & twenty dollars, would make the purchase a
very dear one for the United States. Nor is it in the power of the
Department, in the present State of the funds applicable to Such
objects, to pay the whole amount, that may be Stipulated, before an
appropriation can be asked for. You will therefore propose to the
Indians to pay them a Sum in no event exceeding thirty thousand
dollars, in full for their land, the expenses of emigration & subsistence,
& for all their other claims. Ten thousand dollars of this amount
you can draw for, as Soon as the arrangement is made with them, &
the rest will be paid as soon as an appropriation can be obtained, &
from time to time, within one year, as their circumstances may require.
It will of course be applied by themselves. Should this arrangement
be acceptable, you will take from them an absolute conveyance of all
their lands in Florida to the U. States; stating therein the amount
you may pay, together with the Sum remaining due, & the periods
fixed for payment. -
If the Indians Should prefer having the U. States issue provisions
to them, instead of purchasing themselves, that course may be
adopted, with the understanding however, that the amount So to be
issued, when added to the Sums allowed, Shall not exceed the maximum
before mentioned, of $30.000–
You will be allowed eight dollars a day for your Services, & five

dollars for every twenty miles you may travel, in executing this duty.
But it is not considered necessary that any Secretary Should be
employed, nor any other expense incurred.
It has been suggested to the Department, that these Indians are
desirous an annual appropriation Should be made for the education
of their children. Should this be So, the Department has no objection
to a Stipulation for that purpose to a reasonable amount, depending
for its fulfilment upon the appropriation of Congress, but not making
it an indispensable condition of the arrangement.
A copy of this letter has been Sent to Gov. Duval,” & should it be
inconvenient for you to execute the duties herein specified, he has
been requested to carry these instructions into effect.”

Thomas Baltzell to Delegate White
OAKY HILL June 20th 1832
DEAR SIR Understanding that an appropriation has been made to
repair the road between Marianna and Pensacola I take the liberty to
make some remarks directing your attention to the subject in the hope
that some benefit may be derived from this additional act of munifi-
cience of the Gov". It is with regret I state that the last appropria-
tion was so disposed of as to produce no efficient good. From the best
information I can get not any service has been rendered. This from
what I can learn was owing in a great measure to the loose bargains
made by the agent of Government and the slight attention paid by
him to the business confided to his care. Instead of laboriously devot-
ing himself for two or three weeks to the business I am informed that
he made a hasty excursion through the country without acquiring the
suitable information or making the arrangements proper to accomplish
the work.
It would be proper for me to remark too that no work was done on
the road within fifteen er twenty or thirty miles of Marianna but that
portion of it the most important of any was neglected. Nor was this
because the appropriation had expired. I understand that there are
yet two hundred dollars to be devoted to that object from the former
appropriation.
If some other agent can be selected but an officer of the army we
may possibly get a good road and derive some advantage from the
appropriation otherwise I fear we have nothing to hope for.
Such a man as Lieut Long would do more than fifty officers of the
army unless their duty is better performed than it has been heretofore.
I hope I shall be excused for pressing upon you the importance of an
early engagement in this work. In consequence of the wretched
condition of the road the mail stages have not been carried farther
than Marianna on the route to Pensacola for nearly twelve months
past and indeed after the repair of the road I believe that the stage
ran only a few months.
I do not hesitate to say that if the money from last appropriation
had been properly expended the road would now be in good repair
& much travelled
The work is one of considerable importance to the people of the
territory as well as the United States & very sanguine expectations
are raised that good will arise from the last proposed expenditure.
I have nothing further to write at present but remain Yours very
truly

tions be remitted to you; and you will, as early as practicable, resume
your operations on those works, and carry them on with as much
promptness as may be, consistently with a due regard to economy
and their faithful execution.
Particular instructions are deemed unnecessary, as your experience
of last year will guide you in the operations of this. From the tenor
of your report, at the close of the last Season," it is presumed, that no
labor will be necessary west of Oak Hill, and as the appropriation
somewhat exceeds the amount of your extimate for the completion of
the repairs through to Tallahassee, it will, no doubt, be adequate to
that object.
Notwithstanding the terms of the appropriation for the Eastern
Section, which refer to the Military road, you will consider the amount
granted, applicable to the road leading from Alachua Court House to
Jacksonville and expend it accordingly—It was for the latter that
the estimate was made, and the appropriation beyond doubt was
intended for it.—
I enclose you a letter, referred to me by Mr. White, the delegate
from Florida, signed by several individuals, who are desirous to obtain
a contract.” Prior to concluding any Contracts, you will take pains
to inform yourself accurately, as to the state of the road, the nature
of the work to be bestowed on it, the character and responsibility of
bidders and their ability to fulfil their engagements."—

several communications from the Agent, informing me that Gad

intriguing and interfering with the Indians—to pursuade them not to
remove from Florida. " These men have a store near the Indian

Agency to counteract any impressions these men have made on the
minds of the Indians unfavorable to the plans and views of the Gov-

this measure.
I am convinced that cirtain Individuals in the Wacinity of the
Indians will endeavour to prejudice them against removing west of
the Mississippi That their improper efforts should in time be counter-
acted, is too Obvious to need remark

During the month we experienced a Severe Storm which put back
the work 8 or 10 days otherwise the dredging would now be completed.
This part of the work I have now a prospect of finishing in a time
equal to that lost by the late Storm—
The operations have continued on the Apalachicola River, to
remove the logs that could not be got at last year, to clear away some
trees that had fallen into the river & obstructed its channel & to
remove the heavy timber that was likely soon to be washed in with
the falling-in banks. This will complete all the improvements that
can be made on the river to be of any benefit whatever to its naviga-
tion; and such is the Character of some parts of the river that these
improvements even, will be of but a temporary benefit. On my
recent visit to the river I thought it proper to expend but 8 or 10 days
work more upon it, when the boats machinery &c employed there
will be transfered to the St Marks river above the Nat Bridge.”
The rains we have had have also prevented any work being yet

ration, and the total amount required. Under the circumstances,
the Department has concluded to authorize you to draw for 250$, to
be charged to and paid out of the fund for the relief of the Seminoles,
by the Act of May 31,” which draft you will accompany with such an
estimate as is above prescribed. This remittance, with the 250$ for
the last half of the current year, must be made to meet all the expenses
of feeding the Indians, and that amount will not be exceeded without
express authority from the Department. The time, (from ten to
fifteen days) mentioned by the Agent as necessary to the paying of the
annuities, seems unreasonably long. It is double the time employed
in this business in other tribes of double the number. Your Agent
will be specially instructed upon this point, for good seldom, if ever,
results from this prolonged association with our settlements.
Whether you shall yourself visit the agency is a question you must
determine; it is impossible for the Department to say, whether the
measure be essential to the full and faithful performance of your
official duties. Of this it can only judge by results.
Doct" Hamiltons resignation has been received.”
The compensation offered him cannot, at present, be increased.
You will endeavor to accomplish the object of the Government, under

Deputation, who are to proceed west, vaccinated before their
departure.
An Act of Congress, passed at the last Session, contains the following
provision.
“That no ardent spirits shall be introduced into the Indian Country,
under any pretence whatever.” "
To give effect to the intent of this provision, you will direct your
agent and Sub agent to Seize the prohibited article, whenever and
wherever found, within your Superintendency, and to deposit it where
it will be safe and beyond the reach of violence, should any be
attempted, subject to the order of the Department. Of their pro-

it may suffice to say, their condition is in all respects truly deplorable. It is not
known that they have advanced a single step in any sort of improvement; and as
to the means of education when offered to them they were refused. The Govern-
ment bounty has been put in requisition within a few years, in more than one
instance to preserve them from starvation; and the neighboring Country is often
pillaged by them for the means to preserve life; out of which come excitements
that find their way to the Department in almost ceaseless complaints.”

ceedings, under this order this order, you will keep the Department
regularly advised. If it is strictly enforced, at the approaching
meeting for the payment of the annuities, the traders you mention
will have less power to operate upon the minds of the Indians.
You will explain to the Seminoles, that this measure is dictated by
the interest of the Government feels in the welfare of the red men, to
whom it sustains a parental relation.
The Department is determined rigidly to enforce this law, and it
requires the officers in the Indian Department to exercise an unre-

upon them.

[NA:GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE 12" of Sep" 1832
SIR Permit me to recall to your recollection the understanding I
had with yourself and M Ingham, relative to my compensation as
Receiver for transporting and depositing the Public Money received
at this Office.
The compensation allowed by M. Rush under the Act of the 22"
of May 1826," was so far short of my actual expences in the perform-
ance of this service, and as I conceived so little within the spirit and
intent of the Act that I invariably refused to accept of it, and as my
accounts will shew I made no charge of the percentage on the amount
deposited until May 1831. While at Washington in the Spring of 1831,
I informed you and M Ingham of the difficulty in making my deposits,
and the expences necessarily attending them. You both agreed that
the compensation was too small and that as I had not accepted the
allowance or made any charge under the regulations of M" Rush, that
an additional allowance should be made.”
The instructions of the Department required me to make a deposit
whenever the sum received amounted to $10,000. The distance to
Mobile the place where I was required to make my deposits is 407.
The per centage on this sum under the regulations of M" Rush at the
rate of the fiftyeth part of one per cent for every ten miles would be
eighty one dollars, forty cents. The Stage fair through this country
is 10 cents per mile, which on 407 miles, just equals the amount of com-
*14 STAT. 193. This act authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to make a
reasonable allowance.

pensation, leaving nothing for the subsistence or pay of the carryer.
The time required to perform the trip was usually 20 days, no trust-
worthy person could be employed for a less sum than five dollars per
day, and his subsistence would be about $2 per day, making $140.
Thus the Receiver without being allowed any thing for the “risk”
would be brought in debt for the actual expences $140 on every deposit
of ten thousand dollars.
On these facts being represented to you and M Ingham, I was
authorized to charg in addition to the fiftyeth part of one per cent
25 cents per mile, for every mile actually travelled in making the
deposits, in full Compensation for the risk, labour and expences
provided for in the Act of the 22" of May 1826. This I did and gave
myself credit for 15 trips performed between the years 1825, and 1831,
as will appear in my account for the month of May 1831. This item
has been suspended at the Treasury Department, and the object of
this letter is to obtain from you a statement of the facts as they oc-
curred between M* Ingham you and myself, so far as your recollection
will serve you.

Oak Hill, and as the appropriation somewhat exceeds the amount of

You and Col White have both been informed from time to time
heretofore, of the causes why those claims were not surveyed sooner,"
That your attention may be drawn to the facts, those claims were
situated in the townships that were suspended, the completion of
which was prevented by high water sickness, and information necessary
for identity.

JAMES GADSDEN TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Treaty File:ALS]
WASCISSA 19 Sept 1832
Sir. I returned yesterday from the Appalachicola river where I
had an interview with Blunt, the principal chief on the Indian reser-
vations in that district—The propositions I had to make him, con-
formable to your instructions,” fell so short of the expectations he had,
no doubt, been induced to encourage from private interference, that
he required some further time to deliberate with his people & the
Chiefs alike interested in the removal—They will meet me on the
10" of next month at the Executive office in Tallahassee, prepared
either to accede to, or reject the arrangement I offered to conclude
with them—It is true policy, at least with the Appalachicola Towns,
to state explicitly what the General Government will do; not to
deviate from, or negotiate on the propositions made, and leave the
Indians to their own judgment, which will invariably prove to them
a better guide to their true interests than the private influences
which are exercised behind the curtain; deceiving them as to the great
anxiety of the General Government on the subject of their removal,
and encouraging delay as the surest plan of obtaining their extravigant
demands—The Appalachicola Indians, (at least the Chiefs) are well
convinced they cannot live on their present locations—That they
must follow the Migrating Creeks & Seminoles west, and if they at
this time are induced to reject, the period is not far distant, when
they will themselves petition for the conditions of that very compact
now proferred them by the Executive of the U States 8–

[NA:JD, Sol. Treas., Lets. from U. S. Attys., Clks., and Marshals (Fla.):ALS]
PENSACOLA 20" Sept 1832.
SIR Permit me to call your attention to an occurrence lately
happening at this place in relation to one of the lots belonging to the
government, and to ask your advise conserning it.
The City council, being vested with the power by the the act of
incorporation to open streets, remove buildings and so forth, lately
thought fit to extend a street through the lot alluded to, and to
remove an old building standing upon it, being that used as a court
house. The value of the lot may be $400, and the building, very
old and decayed, was estimated by the jury to be worth only $20–;
and the jury, saying in their virdict that the lot would be appreceation
in value by the extension of the street, assessed no damages to the
government.
The deputy Marshal, being a member of the board of Alderman,
was not disposed to prevent the proceeding, and the Judge of the
County court, having the power to grant writs of injunctions; also
an alderman and the principal mover in the Matter, I concieved I
could do nothing, indeed, I was doubtful whether I might sustain a
bill, Judge Breckenridge, having in similar cases in this court, decided
in favour of the City corporation—In these cases, however, the govern-
ment was not a party, which, perhaps, would make a very different
case. I will suggest in addition that it may be, the lot is inhansed
in value by the extension of the street, and that the building was not
worthy of repair.
I will act accordingly to your instructions.
I will use this occasion to request you to see a letter from M. Camp-
bell, late attorney for this District to the Secretary of the Navy on
the subject of a proceeding instituted by him in the Jackson Court
of this District under the acts of Congress for the preservation of the
live oak timber. The Secretary Suggests the opinion in reply that
the case is not embraced by these acts, but refers him to you for
advise

RICHARD K. CALL TO ELIJAH HAYWARD
[NA:GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE 26" Sept 1832
SIR A question of some interest is frequently presented in carrying
in to effect the Act of Congress of the 5" of April last"—granting the
right of preemption to actual settlers and housekeepers on the public
lands, and on which I have deemed it proper to ask the direction of
the Department.
The form of the Affidavit prescribed by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury and to be taken by the claimants seem to apply only to cases
where the claimants has lived and cultivated on the same tract of
land. Such a construction of the Law would deprive two thirds of the
actual settlers on the public Land previous to the 5" of April, of the
right of preemption. It most frequently occurrs in this country that
the settler builds his homes in the poor pine land for the advantages
of Water and for air and cultivates land at some distance from his
residence, which is productive but which would not answer for a
settlement. When the land is surveyed he frequently finds his house
and his field in different Sections Quarter Sections and townships.
His house is generally of little value, all his efforts and labour having
been directed to the clearing of land and cultivating his Plantation.
The land on which he has lived with all the improvements he has put
on it is not worth $1.25 per acre, and if he wishes to enter the land on
which he has made his plantation he cannot take the oath that he
was an actual settler and house keeper on that land, because his
residence may have been in an entirely different section. In such
cases it appears to me that the merit of the claim is no less than where
the residence and cultivation has been all on the same eighth or
* Other persons were interested in this appointment. Applications and recom-
mendations are in NA (SD, Applications) for the following: John P. Booth, an
inhabitant of the Territory of Florida; Edward R. Byrd, of Mobile, Ala.; John L.
Doggett, of Jacksonville; William F. English, an inhabitant of Fla.; Peter W.

quarter sections. Where the claimant cannot secure both his house
and his Plantation by entering two half eights of land it would seem
to me to be within the spirit of the Law to allow him to make choice
of either.
The enclosed affidavit presents such a case. The claimant could not

although his claim appears to us to be meritorious, we have thought
it improper to allow him to make the entry until we shall receive your

R. BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, Your Several letters of 24" ult” ” and of the 15th 10 & 16th
inst: " have been received.
I very much regret your indisposition, and that the circumstances
connected with the duties of your Office which have grown out of
Congressional legislation should be found among the reasons which
have induced Mr Searcy to tender his resignation as Chief Clerk in
your Office.
Mr Searcy States in his letter that after the returns due to this
Office had been completed, the late law of Congress will cause them
to be of no use.” He must allude to the Act of 5" April last,” and
the necessity of minute Subdivisions of fractional Sections. The
necessity for throwing aside those returns and making out new plats
is not apparent without further explanations. Why may not the
necessary Subdivisions be shewn on those plats?
With regard to the Subdivisions of fractional Sections in former
Surveys, the case is different. Subdivisional plats will be necessary
under those circumstances, & the labor of preparing them will be great.
On the 13" inst: you were written to respecting the arrears of your
Office,” and were requested to make a report of the different duties
to be performed, with an estimate of the number of Clerks &c which
would be required to bring up the work in a given time.
I would now Suggest that the circumstances Set forth in your
communication of the 24" August last, be made to constitute a part
of your Report which will be Submitted to Congress at an early period
of the approaching Session, when, I indulge a confident hope that the
embarrassments existing in the Several Surveying Districts, and the
injury which results to the public Service for want of adequate means
to execute the requirements of law, will be fully & fairly investigated,
and an adequate relief provided. Meanwhile I trust that Mr Searcy
may be induced to continue to perform the duties of the Office as usual,

PARDON C. GREENE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., G 218:LS]
KEY WEST Oct. 15. 1832.
To HON LEWIS CASS, Secretary of War Washington.—
SIR.—The situation which you occupy in the Government of the
United States as chief of the War Department is my apology (if any
is necessary) for addressing you this Letter, in which I shall call your
attention to the frequent destruction of my property and the violation
of my rights as a Citisen by the United States' troops stationed at this
place under the Command of Major Jas M. Glassel.—Shortly after
the arrival of the troops here, it was discovered that the Soldiers were
killing the Cattle on the Island belonging to the Citisens, and at no
very distant period from that time I had occular demonstration of the
fact. Mr Antonio Giraldo and myself being owners of the principal
part of the Stock on the Island went to Maj Glassel and made com-
plaint, at the same time requesting that the Soldiers might be pro-
hibited from hunting through the Island, which they were in the habit
of doing daily. The answer received was that he could not think of
depriving his Soldiers of the amusement of hunting as that was the
only amusement they had.—
Since that time the Soldiers have continued the killing of Cattle
on the Island, are permitted to carry Guns through the Island, and are
frequently seen in the town at night with their Guns. In consequence
of my complaints against the Soldiers, they have insulted me, in the
most gross and infamous manner, so much so, that I have been
compelled to use force in my own defence.—The commanding officer
has distinctly said he cannot punish the Soldiers, and they evade the
Laws not easily enforced. The Soldiers have violated the City regula-
tions in the most barefaced and open manner, by shooting through the
town day and night and have put at defiance the efforts of the Civil
Authorities, and it is useless to complain to the Commanding Officer
my property and that of other Citisens is wantonly destroyed and the
Soldiers are still permitted to hunt and shoot through the Island at
their pleasure and without restraint; and discipline is not kept up
among them.
The Soldiers which were sent here to protect the Citisens and their
property, instead of answering the intended purpose have become a
nuisance on the Island in consequence of the absence of that discipline,
which you Sir, will readily admit as a military man, is indispensable
to keep men in order.—

St AUGUSTINE 1st Nov 1832
SIR I have the honour to report myself at this place, where I have
been near a month attending to the defence of certain cases brought
against the United States by individuals for the purpose of establishing
their claims to land.
We are now engaged in the case of Pedro Miranda involving the
title to 368,640 acres of land. The grant is evidently fraudulent, and
we hope to defeat the claim, though under the dicision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Arredondo, the result is doubtful.”
Very Respectfully Your Obt St

28 Alexander Hamilton, the former land commr. in E. Fla., considered the
Miranda grant a forgery and recommended to Graham, Mar. 19, 1829 (NA,
GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd., H), that the public officers in Fla. obtain original doc-
uments. On Mar. 24, 1829 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 23), Graham instructed
Downing to examine the documents and report his opinion on the suspect grant.
Thomas Douglas transmitted papers relative to the case to Graham, June 3, 1829
(loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Recd., D), for an official opinion by William Wirt.

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF THE
TERRITORY
[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[November 5, 1832]
To the honorable the Senate and house of Representatives of the United
States of America.
The Subscribers Citizens of Florida, respectfully represent, that
they conceive it to be their duty, to solicit your attention, to the
condition, (with a view to its improvement) of that part, of their
Territory, which is watered by the Suwannee, and its tributary
Streams.
This extensive region of Country, embracing a large portion of
Middle and East Florida, as well as several of the lower lower Counties
of Georgia, is dependant upon the Suwannee river, as a channel,
through which, to convey its productions to market. However much
the improvement of the navigation of this River, is to be desired by
your petitioners, they are aware, that the claims of the general govern-
ment, are greatly paramoun, to individual interests, in its consumation.
It is generally conceeded by those that have examined this part of the
territory, after having explored other portions of it, that not an in-
considerable quantity of the finest Live Oak timber, of this territory,
susceptible of being rendered valuable to the United States, lies upon
this River. The land contiguous to the River, for seventy miles from
its mouth, with but a small exception, has not been offered for sale,
and consequently yet constitutes a part of the public domain; And
how much this part of the territory being within the admitted limits
of the admitted sugar region, would be enhanced in value, your peti-
tioners leave for you to judge. The Cedar, yellow pine, and Cypress
timber, bordering upon the river, and its vicinity, would be rendered
valuable by the improvement of the navigation; but doubtless will
continue valueless, without such facilities as a navigable stream, and
a good inlet afford, in the transportation of naval Stores.
Whilst, several rivers of this Territory, of less note than than the
Suwannee, have been carefully examined, and soundings of the several
channels, through which they discharge themselves, taken and lade
down, by the Corpse of Engineers sent by order of the government, to

make out a chart of the Florida coast. This river was not examined
with that [MS. torn] ntion which its importance in the class of Rivers
in the Territory [MS. torn] mineted. Hence arises the doubt which
exists of knowing correctly, what depth of water can be had at the
bar. The Suwannee discharges itself through three channels. It is
ascerted by those that have examined each of these passes, that one
of them affords eight feet of water, From the soundings made by the
by the Corpse Engineers only five and one half feet are given. It has
been represented to your petitioners, that the channel examined by
the Engineers is not the one, that affords the greatest depth of water.
Your petitioners are led to believe from the best information that
can be obtained, that at a verry inconsiderable expense, important
improvements might be made in the navigation of this River, which
they beg leave to suggest. By excavating an oyster bar, and stoping
two of the channels, the current of water would be forced through
one Channel, which from the quantity of water and rapidity of the
Current would verry soon wear a channel of sufficient depth for all
the purposes required upon this River. There would then be, an
uninterrupted navigation, for any vessel that could get in at the
mouth for seventy miles up the River, at all stages of the water, and
by removal of a small ledge of rock that extends across the river, the
navigation would be good, for large port Boats, or Seamboats, up to
the confluence of the Suwannee, and the Withlacoocha, thirty miles
further, Sanguine as your petitoners are, in the belief, that the work
is practicable, and that its costs would be more than doubly paid by
the additional value which it would give to government land, Yet
are they unwilling for the government to incur much expense without
a certainty of an adeqaute good, Therefore ask, for a survey of the
Suwannee River to be made (as early as may be convenient) with a
view to its ultimate improvement and your petitioners in duty bound
will ever pray.

of the U. States, with a view to the constructions of a Chart of the
Florida coast, justice was not done to the Suwanna. It has three
passes, one of which gives 8 feet, but the Soundings of the Corps of

SIR: In the communication from this Office, of the 3rd of August,”
it was suggested, that no labor would be necessary West of Oakhill, on

I send you enclosed, a copy of Captain Shannon's Estimate,” which
formed the basis of the appropriation of $4000 for that Road,” and
which may be useful to you in the prosecution of the repairs. As the
appropriation was made specifically for the repair of the Military
Road between Pensacola and Tallahassee, you will not be at liberty
to depart from its course, without special authority from this Office.—

Ways and Means that the usual sum of ten thousand dollars was to
be devoted to this service alone." The General Appropriation was
made for surveys, in the unsuspecting confidence of Congress, that
this paramount duty of the Government to Spanish grantees whose
rights were guarranteed by Treaty would be respected and the funds
applied in good faith to the purposes for which they were designed.
It has however inadvertently and incautiously conferred a discretion
as to the application of the money which is likely not to be exercized
for their benefit without your interpossition. It has been now Twelve
years since the Treaty and ten years since a Board of Commissioners
was organized to adjudicate these claims, and Six years since the con-
firmation of their Reports, and still the lands are not surveyed. In the
Territory of Florida favorite Deputy Surveyors of lands have been en-
gaged for years in the Surveys of pine woods at the enormous income of
forty dollars per day whilst these Spanish grantees are deprived of the
enjoyment of their property for the want of this necessary incident in
the execution of the Treaty." For the last year the only answer that
could be obtained from the Commissioner of the General Land Office
was that Col. Butler the Surveyor General was sick and incapable of
attending to business. I humbly submit to you how far this can be con-
sidered a valid excuse. The Deputies make the surveys and not the
Surveyor General, and instructions for these Deputies could be pre-
pared in the General Land Office, and the order given whether the Sur-
veyor General was sick or well. I believe that many of the claims were
surveyed and so badly executed that they would not pass inspection at
the General Land Office when there was a competent draughtsman in
it, and were returned. The Deputies ought either to have been sued
upon their Official Bonds, or been compelled to resurvey the claims
without further expense to the Government. However this may be,
these surveys have been suspended for several years to the great
injury of the owners of the land and detriment of the country generally
in preventing its settlement and cultivation. I have seen from the

ing private land claims, and the latter's reply, Dec. 31, 1831 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets.
Sent, Bk. 3), that no special appropriation was necessary.
* The same complaint had been made by White to Hayward, Aug. 13, 1832
(NA, GLO Misc. Lets. Recd.). White's interest in the matter was personal as
he had a claim to an island in the Escambia River originally a Spanish grant to

I stated that Econchati Meco & Mulatto King, had declined by letter"
meeting me at the time & place designated or of negotiating on any
terms for a removal west-
As Blunt however was of opinion that those chiefs had not expressed
their real opinion, but had been operated upon by secret and adverse
influences, and still deemed it advisable for me to attempt another
interview with them, I concluded to embrace the occasion of paying
off the annuity, when a general meeting of the chiefs & Warriors could
be had without any extra expence to the mission on which I was
engaged—Econchatimeco & Mulatto King however did not make
their appearance at the place designated by the Agent of Indian
affairs, and directed their Younger chiefs & Warriors not to go, or to
receive the annuity due them, under a pretext that some plan was
devised to entrap them into a cession of their land *—Some few
however, in defiance of their authority did attend, and on hearing
the talk I gave them, appeared much satisfied with it, declaring at
the same time that the older chiefs had deceived them, and had not
presented the views of their Father in Washington, in the light I had
done—
They then enquired whether I would treat with as many of the
Younger chiefs & Warriors, as might be desposed to emigrate, seper-
ately from the Older chiefs or Head Men of the towns on the Appala-
chicola—Having no instructions however on this subject, and seeing
a difficulty arrising from the fact that by the Treaty of Camp Moultrie
the reservations are in the name of the chiefs Econchatimeco & Mu-
latto King, I could only reply that I had no doubt the President of
the US would authorise some one, at the proper time, to enroll the
names of those of Mulatto King & Econchatimecos Towns as were
disposed to migrate, and to treat with them on equitable terms
seperately from the head Chiefs, if they continued resolved not to
remove—But that it was the wish of the President, as he was acting
solely in this case for the benefit of his Red Children, that there should
be no divisions among them—I recommended therefore that they
should return to their Towns, state to the Head Chiefs their deter-
mination & what would be the consequence of a continued obstenate
refusal on their part to acceede to the very advantageous terms offered
them by the Government of the U States—In the mean while I sug-
gested that two or more of the Younger Chiefs, in whose representa-
tion confidence might be reposed, should accompany Blunt's exploring
party West, and that probably the accounts they might be able to

give of the country on their return, might more favourably dispose
the older men to migrate—Twenty four of the Younger Chiefs &
Warriors notwithstanding however, came as far as Tallahassee yes-
terday to seek an interview with me for the purpose of negotiating
for their removal west, if the terms offered were acceptable—I declined
however, for the reasons stated, entering into any seperate arrange-
ments with them, and succeeded I believe in convincing them that the
course I had recommended was the most judicious—Two or More of
the Younger Chiefs will therefore accompany Blunts exploring party
west, and on their return, I am satisfied, there will be little or no
difficulty in making a satisfactory arrangement with Econchatimeco
& Mulatto King—
If not a majority certainly of the Younger Chiefs & Warriors of those
Towns; Those who still retain their hunting habits, and who are most
objectionable to the neighbouring white settlements, will treat for a
removal, provided some one be authorised with full instructions, at
the proper time, to conclude an arrangement—The terms on which
I think a negotiation may be effected, will be similar to those agreed
on with Blunt, with a proportional part of the value of the reservation
abandoned to be paid to those who may migrate—In this event those
who remain will have to be limited to their proportion of the land—
Whether I shall conduct this negotiation must depend upon the
Executive of the U S & the confidence he may continue to repose in
my ability faithfully to execute the trust refered in me—I have now
closed my mission to the Seminole Indians, & have balanced my
accounts with the Indian Department—The duty I trust has been

The work has gone on well in the Harbour for these two months,
although not so rapidly as I had expected: some time having unavoid-
ably been lost in acquiring the best method for blasting the rock in
the bed of the channel at the Devils Elbow. The plan adapted is to
bore into the rock from above the water by having chissels attached
to long poles, for 8 to 10 feet; for canisters of 4 inches diameter by
10 in length. When the canisters are charged, tubes one inch in
diameter are attached to them of sufficient length to sink the canister
& open above water. The hole bored above the canister is ramed
with pounded stone and the canister fired by dropping into it a hot
ball.—This mode of blasting has proved perfectly successful—each blast
breaks up the stone for 10 or 12 feet around, so fine that the dredging
machine will be sufficient to take up nearly the whole of it—More
than half of the blasting is now completed—The work of M" Wyatt is
progressing very slowly, and there is no probability of his complying
with his contract," unless the time is extended a month to him to
which I can see no objection

were sent to the Committee of the Whole House which was considering the bill
(H.R. 104) to give to actual settlers on public land a right of preemption in the
purchase of one quarter section at $1.25 an acre (ibid., p. 339). It was a Senate

JOSEPH W. HARRIS TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
FORT KING Sem Agency Flo. 3" Decr.1832
SIR I have the honour to cover to your address with this my Sum-
mary Statement togather with Muster Roll and Report of Persons
hired for the month of November.
I have also the Satisfaction to report to you that we have at length
succeeded in opening Water Communication with Pelatka, our Depot
on the St. Johns R. Sickness prevented me descending with the
boat party as I had proposed, and Lieut Alden was consequently
sent in my place. He succeeded in clearing all serious obstructions
to boat navagation in the Ocklewaha during the present stage of its
Waters—which is somewhat above its average height—and accom-
plished his trip, returning with a load, in Eighteen Days. The
distance he estimates from 130 to 150 miles. With fortune in our
favour we may calculate upon making our trips hereafter in, from
10 to 12 days. The banks of the Ocklewaha are however very
low-frequently under water & thickly wooded. The navigation is
consequently, constantly liable to be impeded from the falling in of
trees.
The boat which Capt. Graham has constructed *—for I have no
claim to any credit there—is a fine Keel boat 55 ft in length by 8 in
beam, with an ample and water-tight Cargo Box rising 4 ft above
the Gunnels, effectually securing her entire load from the inclemencies
of the weather. She is built entirely of Oak—is capable of carrying
upwards of a hundred Barrels in bulk with ease—is propelled chiefly
with poles, but, when the width of the river will admit, with oars;
and is effeciently manned with by a Skipper & Eight hands. She
draws when loaded about 17 inches of water: the shoalest part of the
navigation at the lowest stage of the Waters is 23 inches.
After various experiments on the limestone in our immediate vicinity
I at length congratulated myself that I had found such as would yield
lime suitable to the purposes of building. A few days since I burnt a
kiln of it, but it produced poor stuff, of vastly inferior quality to several
small specimens from the same rock that I had previously submitted
to the action of fire. They obtain excellent lime, however, with
eighteen miles of this post; and I am confident with a little more
perseveance we shall be able to obtain it much nearer.
I had the honour to make application to the department, dated
4th Octr. for 5 Cast Iron Stoves. These are much wanted. There
are no chimnies to the Soldiers barrack & we have no material for

constructing such with safety. The building is very large & the roof
stands at a great distance from the ground, which prevents my making

SIR I beg leave to call your attention to the enclosed letter from
one of the Claimants of the Arredondo grant confirmed at the last
Session of the Supreme Court.
This appears to be a new species of nulification when a Deputy
Surveyor presumes to set aside the decree of the Supreme Court. I
believe no office has ever been so inefficiently managed as the Sur-
veyor's office in Florida. The complaint is universal among the
Spanish grantees that they can not have their claims surveyed, but

for Ten Years for a decision on the claim we have had to wait 8 months
for the Mechanical Operation of a Survey, and finally I learn from
Mr Levy who is on the Spot that the Deputy Surveyor is bent on
removing the location of the grant near 7 miles from that adopted
by the parties, from Paines town to the a Sink on the Great Prairie.
The effect of such a removal would be to exclude from the Grantees
upwards of 10 M acres of the best hammoc lands to the South, besides
a large quantity of first rate rolling pine land.
The location was made by the Grantees at the beginning, under
circumstances of great notoriety, and which can be easily proved, that
Paines town was always held and considered the Alachua proper so
notorious indeed that the parties would have considered themselves
acting erroniously had they located any where else. The parties, on
locating, changed the name of Paines Town, in honor of the then
existing Chief, to that of Micanopy, which is the indisputable centre
of the grant.
The Deputy Surveyor, I am informed, urges as a reason for removing
the location, that the term “Alachua” signifies literally a “Jug” and
that he hence infers that as there is a Sink hole on the Great prairie
which by analogy holds water as well as a jug, this must be the place
referred to in the decree of the Supreme Court. But if analogical
reasoning of this sort were permitted to be produced against our
location, it can be easily refuted thus. That & het the Great Prairie
has on it 3 Jugs in 3 different situations, and not only this, many other
jugs or sinks surround Micanopy in almost every direction. The
whole Country in fact of which Micanopy is in the middle may be
termed a jug from the connected sheets of water which it contains in
rainy seasons, and that this it was so considered by the Indians I had
from one of them, Salms at Micanopy. I asked him to point to the
place called Alachua, when he made a sweep with his arms indicating
a general surface. The Surveyors reasoning therefore is a feeble
analogy brought against absolute facts, that Paines Town or Micanopy
was the Alachua proper at the time of location, and I take the liberty
of mentioning the circumstances at this time under a hope that the
land office may put a period to these protracted difficulties.
Our present plan is to protest in the event of the Surveyor persisting
in changing the location.
I have not by me a copy of the record in this case, but I believe it
shows distinctly enough that the location was properly made by the
parties.
Very respectfully I am Dear Sir Your Obt Servi

SIR. On the 7" Inst. I received from you a copy of a letter from
P. C. Greene to the Sec of War making various complaints against
me as commandant of this post," and an order endorsed by you,
that I should “report on its contents.”
Had I seen the letter merely as a letter from M. Greene, I should
never have deigned to notice it, even in private conversation, coming
from such a person. But inasmuch as it has been officially forwarded
to me, it becomes my duty to report thereon te yet, and will endeavor
to be as brief as I can, altho’ I apprehend that some details, which are
necessary, may be tiresome to you.
* House Journal, 22 Cong., 2 sess., p. 46. See ante, p. —, n. Several other peti-
tions concerning roads which were presented to the first session of the 22d Congress
have not been found. From the counties of St. Johns and Mosquito was pre-
sented one on Dec. 21, 1831, relative to the repair of the road from St. Augustine
to Wanton's post office in Alachua Co. and Bellamy's road from St. Augustine
to Tallahassee (House Journal, 22 Cong., 1 sess., p. 79). An act of Congress
approved July 3, 1832 (4 STAT. 552), appropriated $2,500 for repairs to the St.
Augustine-Tallahassee road and $4,000 for repairs to the Pensacola-Tallahassee
road. Two other petitions were presented by Del. White on Mar. 26, 1832:
one from inhabitants of the counties of St. Johns, Alachua, and Mosquito solicited
provision for repair of the road from St. Augustine to Wanton's P. O., and the
other from inhabitants of Duval and Alachua counties asked for appropriations
for the repair of the Black Creek road (House Journal, 22 Cong., 1 sess., p. 536).

As M. Green says, He & M" Giraldo called upon me one evening
with information which induced a belief that two of the soldiers
had that day killed a cow on the Island; I suggested the propriety of
their being silent on the subject until I could ascertain who the
offenders were: which I did the next day through the means of a
confidential N. C. Officer, & sent word to them; they both came up
& found it to be one of M" Giraldo's. I promised him renumeration
& punishment to the individuals through a court martial: this was
acquieced in, but from reasons that I could not learn, they were
brought before the Grand jury, and thus the case was taken from my
interference & martial law. On the complaint, M. Greene did say
that I “must” keep the soldiers within the Cantonment & prohibit
them from carrying arms: to which I possitively objected, even if
it was in my power to carry such prohibition into effect.
The next case was M* Greene swearing before a magistrate that
a named soldier had discharged his gun within the precincts of the
Corporation: He was bound over & appeared before the district
court; the jury without leaving the box acquitted him. The same
soldier who had committed the above offences, soon afterwards shot
another cow under charge of M. Browne of this place, which he stated
to Mr Browne he did under a belief that it belonged to Mr Greene.
He was soon reported to me & I instantly confined him in irons, with
a determination to turn him over to the civil authority & thus rid
the service of such a disgrace to it. I repeatedly urged M. Browne
to have him brought before the court: his reasons will appear in his
note to me in answer to one of mine addressed to him to-day; and
which is the only document I shall at present offer, altho' I can
easily obtain more.
These are the only cases, on the subject matter of M* Green's
complaint except that of want of discipline in the command which
I freely acknowledge in part. With barely men sufficient to keep
one centinel, it is impossible to keep them in their quarters at night;
and in a place like this where almost every third house is kept as a
grog shop by the most depraved of men; the town filled with sailors
from wrecked vessels & wreckers, and the principal part of the in-
habitants free mulattoes from Nassau, the difficulty of keeping up
regular discipline must at once occur to you.
However, every thing went on between M* Greene and myself as
smoothly as could be with persons of such contra associations until
the 8* Oct. (his letter to the Sec of War is dated 15* Oct.) when he
wantonly attacked behind his back, & beat with a bludgeon one of
my sergeants to such a degree that his life was much endangered: on
seeing the man I immediately went to town & entered a prosecution

against him: a true bill was found by the grand jury but the judge
had to adjourn the Court until May next for the want of a petit jury.
Hence the cause of his letter.
It is not my wish or disposition at any time to speak of the private
character of any one; but in my present distant location from Gov-
ernment, I deem it only self defence to let them know something of
M” Greene's character; for, as his clerk wrote the letter for him to the
Sec of War, so might any vagabond hire a man to do the same office
against me. I understand that M. Greene left his native state to
defraud his creditors; left his family; got command of a Guineaman
vessel in the slave trade for Havana; made money, & not daring to
go home speculated on the lands in this place, the proprietors being
much in want of funds: his wife & children in their native state, he
has, ever since my arrival here, until very lately, lived in open con-
cubinage with a black woman from Nassau, by whom he has children,
and who left him in consequence of continued brutal treatment,
during his fits of intoxication, which occur every afternoon.
I must now say that I was perfectly gratified by the manner in
which the complaint was forwarded to me for my report thereon; but
soon after its reception, some citizens from N. York stated that it
was spoken of very freely, that, “P. C. Greene had preferred charges
against me to the SecY of War.”
I am always ready to meet charges against me, & feel careless of
the result: but really I cannot well bear, nor can I see the justice &
humanity of afflicting one's friends before he is known to be a cul-
prit; or before he even dreams of it himself. I cannot for a moment
believe that any individual in the Department ever intended to do
me an injury; but the last circumstance stated has already had its
effect, and may yet have a greater one. I could have wished that
the affair had not been mentioned until I knew something of it.

their minds, which they have no wish to change.

You will see by the accompanying Sketch the nature of the im-
provements necessary for the convenience of the trade of the place.
The channel at present used for vessels to reach the town of Apalach-
icola is very circuitous, besides its being of a debth to admit vessels
of light draught of water only. By it there is but about eight feet
of water to the town. The natural channel for that branch of the
river which runs by the town is that which follows a straight course
to St. George's Sound, and has been obstructed by the sand which
has been washed from the sand bank at the east of it by the winds
& storms from that direction. This obstruction has the appearance
of being many years in forming, and from the fine & clay texture of
the sand which lays perfectly hard, it would probably be many years
more before the channel would fill up again if left to itself, should it
now be opened. The filling up of the channel could be further pre-
vented by obstructing the present channel for the escape of the water
& reflecting it into the one improved. This could well be done by a
single row of piles across it driven 12 or 14 feet into the bottom &
securing their hea [MS torn] well together by strips tunneled on each
side [of] them.
The trade of Apalachicola has increased to that extent which seems
to claim this improvement from government, besides the importance
of it in a Military point of view. Last year upwards of 16000 bales of
cotton was shipped from the port of Apalachicola, and a proportion-
able quantity of goods imported, to the exports; besides great quan-
tities of lumber, which is becoming a trade of considerable importance.
It was here that the transports of provisions were delayed several
weeks at the risk of disasterous consequences during the campaign
into the creek country—The U. States Arsinal is to be located about
180 miles up the Apalachicola River; and recently a contract for navy
timber has been made for which a part of the supply is to be from
the waters of this stream
The following is an estimate of the cost of the improvement here
suggested to be made— -
Expense in replacing worn out parts of Machinery, re-
pairs &c and removing to Apalachicola, the Machine
& boats used in St Marks Harbor . . . . . . . . . $1.200.00
Hire & feed of one overseer & six hands and wood for

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF
ST. AUGUSTINE
[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[December 26, 1832]
To the Honourable Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Citizens of St Augustine in East Florida
respectfully presents;
That the celebrated Fort of St Marks which for a century afforded
ample protection to the City of St. Augustine and secured the Province
during that time to the Spanish sway is now rapidly delapidating
and passing into ruin.
Immense sums of money have been expended in constructing
this beautiful fabrick, and with the addition of some repairs it must
remain what it ever has been a key to the possession of this Territory,
and in the fortune of war will continue to exhaust the power & in-
genuity of invaders
Adjoining the Fort and stretching along in front of the City are
the remains of a Sea-Wall which was found necessary to protect it
from the violence of the Equinoctial storms. A considerable portion
of this Wall was improvidently taken away shortly after the transfer
of the Province to the United States to construct a wharf in front of
the Barrck, for the use of the United States' Troops, leaving much
property both publick and private exposed to inevitable ruin. The
*The act approved Mar. 2, 1833 appropriated $8,700 for improving the river
and harbor Apalachicola (4 STAT. 649). See post, p. 794.

safety of the citizens requires that this Wall should be rebuilt.—Since
it has lain in this state many houses have been destroyed and whole
lots overflowed. Under these circumstances such buildings as
distance has hitherto secured must be eventually prostrated and
their sites will hasten to form the bed of the River.
Your Memorialists with the liveliest feelings of necessity most
respectfully solicit an appropriation for the rebuilding of the Sea-Wall
and for the honour and interests of the country they also solicit the
immediate repair of the Fort St Mark.”

AD 1832.

[January 2, 1833]
THE HONB° LOUIS M*LANE Secretary of the Treasury
The Commissioner of the General Land Office to whom has been
referred the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17*
ult° * which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to inform the
House “what causes have prevented the survey of the private con-
firmed land claims in Florida, and whether any errors were made in
the Surveys in West Florida which caused their return to the Sur-
veyor General, and whether any instructions were given for the re-
survey or proceedings instituted against the Deputies, & whether the
United States have been or are charged with the re-survey out of the
public treasury, and that he communicate the instructions given to
the Surveyor General on the subject of the survey of the private
claims,” has the honor to submit herewith copies of all the corre-
spondence between the General Land Office and the Surveyor of the
public lands in Florida, in relation to the survey of the private claims
in that territory and the correction of certain errors in the surveys
bordering on the River Escambia.”
From this correspondence it will be seen that the early attention
of this office was drawn to the surveys of the private claims in Florida,
and that every endeavour has been made by it to ensure the progress
of that branch of the work with all the rapidity and accuracy possible.
It is apparent from an inspection of the township plats that under

these instructions a great many of the claims have been surveyed,
but that there may be some claims in those townships which have not
been surveyed is also probable, as notwithstanding every exertion has
been made by the Department to induce the claimants to afford that
information to the Deputy respecting the localities and boundaries of
their claims, which could be furnished by themselves alone, it is ap-
parent from the representations of the Surveyor General and his
deputies, that in many cases the Claimants would not afford that in-
formation by which the Surveyor would have to be guided in the per-
formance of his duty, and that he has been left entirely unassisted by
the parties individually interested in his endeavours to survey their
lands correctly—and it is very probable that some of the claims may
not have been surveyed in consequence of the compensation allowed
by law, being totally inadequate to the services required—This is the
case in relation to Key West and to many claims in Louisiana.
Part of the Country between the Suwanee River and the Atlantic
Ocean, in which there are private claims, is believed not to have yet
been surveyed, and as the private claims have to be surveyed and
numbered in connection with the public lands, there doubtless are
claims there which have not been reported as surveyed, and plats of
which cannot be returned to the proper Land Office until the Survey
of the Township in which they are included, shall have been examined
and approved by the Surveyor General.
That the delay in issuing patents for the private claims in Florida
is in a great measure to be attributed to causes over which the Sur-
veyor General has not a control is apparent from his letter of the 14"
January 1831 * in which he says “In the report you were kind enough
to send, I find a remark under the head of Florida that many private
claims have been surveyed, but no Certificates have been forwarded,
which ought to have been received long since. I hope the delin-
quency was not intended to be applied to this Office, as I claim to
have complied with the act of Congress on that subject, and under
which the Register is required to forward Certificates for data to
govern the issuing of the patents;” and from the fact of the Register
of the Land Office at Tallahassee, having forwarded to this office
about one hundred Certificates for those claims, but which in conse-
quence of the defects therein I had to return to him during the last
winter for correction—They have not been reforwarded to this
office.
Some of the surveying of the swamps on the Escambia river proving
erroneous the plats were returned to the Surveyor General for cor-
rection, but in consequence of the nature of the ground, of high waters

and of the sickness of the Deputies employed in that work, it was n
until 11" April 1832 that the Surveyor General was enabled to repo
the work as having been performed,” altho' the plats have not y
reached this Office—all the correspondence on this subject will l
found among the papers herewith transmitted.
In cases of errors in surveying the Deputies who executed the wor
where it is not fully & satisfactorily proved that those errors hal
arisen from causes which they could not control, are required to mal
the requisite corrections without any compensation therefor—and :
by the letter of 26 October 1825, from the Surveyor General it appea
that in all cases he has taken bonds from his Deputies with good an
sufficient security in the sum of 10.000. Dollars for the correct ar
faithful execution of their contracts,” any expense which may l
incurred in correcting their work, will be re-imbursed by legal pr
ceedings under those bonds—From an examination of the accoun
of the Surveyor General which have been rendered to the 30" of Sep
last, it does not appear that any charge is made therein for re-survey
or corrections.
Part of the delay which occurred in reporting the Surveys to th
Office has doubtless been occasioned by the long continued illness
the Surveyor General and of the Clerks employed in his Office, ar
at the date of the last letter from the Surveyor General he was
sick as to prevent his attention to business.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

delay in making the Survey, and giving an insight into the motives
of the party claimant, in wishing to precipitate the execution of the
Survey, by Complaints to your Department of delay and inattention

The Honb. Mr White, in his nullification letter of the 8th Dec'
ult,” charges “that the Deputy Surveyor presumes to set aside the
decree of the Supreme Court,”—this charge, M White knows to be
untrue. The great desire and anxiety of the claimants and their
Agents, is to prevent, the Survey of the claim being made agreeably
to the decree of the Supreme Court, and the best evidence which can
be obtained as to the identity of the beginning point.
Attempts were at first made to confuse and embarrass the Surveyor,
So as to have the Survey executed to Suit their own wishes and
interest—not succeeding, other attempts of a more persuasive charac-
ter were made—but the intelligence and Sterling integrity of M*
Washington, being more than they expected, their vexation and
disappointment is to be vented upon me and the management of my
office.
I will just remark, the better to understand men and their motives,
that it is the impression and general understanding in this Country
that M White has a contingent if not a fee simple interest in most
of the large and litigated claims in the Territory.

ALACHUA SAVANNA F. 16* Dec 1832
SIR, The case of Arredondo's Grant contrary to all expectat
when I left Tallahassee, has been one of unusual difficulty to
Surveyor—That its location is of great importance to the respect
parties concerned, and one too of the most weighty, as well as
most delicate responsibility to the Surveyor, must be admitted
every one, who knows the nature of the case.—

Feeling this responsibility in all its force, and determined to fortify
myself on substantial grounds, so as to be enabled to bid defiance
to the clamours of interested men, and to execute impartial justice,
it becomes necessary that the whole matter should be thoroughly
investigated;—and to the best of my judgement, I have so far, had
this investigation—
When I had the pleasure of last seeing you at your residence you
seemed to think that there would not be much difficulty in the matter,
for the impression then seemed to be that the Prairie (termed on the
map the Alauchua Savanna) was the place known as Alachua, and
coming within the meaning of the Decree of the Supreme Court of
the United States, and that in the Survey it would be adopted as
the place known as Alachua, inhabited in other times, by a tribe of
Seminole Indians,—and this impression on my part, was strengthened
by the statement of the most intelligent of the deputation of Seminole
Indians now on an exploring expedition with Major Fagan" West
of the Mississippi-On reaching Micinopa (the place where Edward
M. Wanton lives) on the 22" of October last M. David Levy, Agent
for those claiming under Arredondo, exhibited Sundry statements
which he had collected relative the the “place known as Alachua,
inhabited in other times by a tribe of Seminole Indians,” from which
it appeared absolutely necessary as a Safe guard to strict justice,
that there should be a thorough investigation of the matter.—I
thought it advisable again to call upon the Indians for further in-
formation respecting the “place known as Alachua, inhabited in
other times, by a tribe of Seminole Indians”—A copy of their State-
ment is herewith enclosed—There appears to be strict coinci-
dence between the Statement of the Indians given in a solemn manner
in their Council house, and that given by the Delegation of Seminoles
with Major Fagan—By their Statement it appears that the Alachua
Savanna as now known by the White people, was known by them
“in other times,” as Alachua—and that the Indians for ten miles
around were called Alachua Indians, because these Indians lived
in the neighbourhood of the Alachua Savanna—It appears from this
view which the Indians had of the settlements near the Alachua
Savanna, that, the country or Territory of Alachua as known by
the white people, must have taken its name from the Alachua Sa-
vanna—and more especially as Alachua is an Indian word-
After visiting the Seminole Indians at their council house, I deter-
mined to made enquiries, and obtain all the testimony I could from
the old inhabitants of the country—and to satisfy myself thoroughly

it became necessary that I should visit distant parts of the country
to see the different persons whose information was desired—I have
obtained much useful information, and such as enables me to form a
correct judgment on the matter—That I should have been much de-
layed in the investigation relative to the place of Alachua as known
“in other times” is readily accounted for, on a correct understanding
of the difficulties presented in many respects.
From all the information which I have yet derived it does not ap-
pear that the Alachua Savanna was ever inhabited by Indians, but
it does appear that the borders of said Savanna were settled in var-
ious directions, by Seminole Indians, and from reputable and disin-
terested men that the country known “in other times” as Alachua,
derived its name from the Alachua Savanna, as known at this day,
by the white People.
I have been anxious to obtain from the Agent of the Grants, M*
David Levy, all the written evidence upon which they based their
location of the Arredondo Grant—but M* Levy refuses to grant my
request unless I shall conform to his wishes in making the location!!!
This being the state of the case it appears that I have to rely upon
other Sources of information—I shall forbear at present to animadvert
upon the course pursued by M. David Levy and others interested.
Herewith you will receive a Copy taken from the Grant of Arre-
dondo sent to me by M. David Levy, In surveying the claim of Ar-
redondo a doubt exists with me, whether or not I am permitted to
look into the Grant and lay aside the Decree of the Supreme Court
of the United States.—Were I left at my discretion in the case, I
would start instantly to St Augustine and run the distance of 52
miles West, called for in said Grant. And there fix the location of
the claim—The calls of the Grant would in my opinion, miss the
Alachua Prairie 10 or 15, and perhaps 20 miles North—It appears
that there was no survey made under the Spanish Government, or if
surveyed there is no evidence of a survey so far as I can learn—M"
David Levy Says that there was no survey made by the Spanish
Goverment directly—but that there was a survey made by M.
Vignoles who was employed by the Proprietors of the Grant for that
purpose.
The Claimants under Arredondo, or their Agent it seems would be
satisfied if the place where Wanton lives “known in other times” as
Cuscowilla, or the place known as Painestown (which were said to
have been Capital towns in their turn, of the Seminoles, at different
Periods) was adopted as the central point of their Grant—but as I am
strongly, very strongly supported in saying that Cuscawilla and
Painestown were the appropriate and proper names of the Indian
towns in the neighbourhood of the Alachua Savanna, I cannot from

the evidence already taken, strengthened by the general under-
standing of the people living in the neighbourhood of the Grant,
as well as elsewhere, where I have been in East Florida, for a
moment believe that the towns of Cuscawilla and Painestown could
be considered as Alachua towns, with more propriety than the neigh-
bouring Indian towns: to wit Hogtown, Bowlesstown, Wacahootie,
or any other town in the Territory of Alachua—With this view of the
case I cannot perceive, how it could be possible in justice, to fix upon
either of the towns mentioned as the Central point of the Grant of
Arredondo—and that from the moment the Surveyor loses sight of
the Alachua Savanna, he is left at his own discretion to adopt any
Indian town which suits his pleasure, provided it be within the limits
of the country “known as Alachua, inhabited in other times, by a
tribe of Seminole Indians”—but confined to the Savanna, he would
be bound to adopt it centre, as the Centre of the Grant—The centre
of the country at large known as Alachua could not—in my Opinion
be adopted, because I understand that there is no evidence in the
Spanish Archieves recognizing an Indian boundary and it is very un-
certain whether a regular Indian boundary could be defined—In the
loss of such a guide in the present case, the Surveyor it seems to me,
would have no alternative left other than to adopt the Alachua
Savanna, or the Calls of Grant—The calls of the Grant in ordinary
cases, supercede all other Calls, and particularly in cases of fraud in
the original Survey—I consider the call of the course and distance of
a line run upwards of 52 miles West of St Augustine, as a specific
call, as much so as one of the actual Boundaries of a Survey—I hope
you will pardon me for saying so much about the Grant.
The copy of the testimony herewith forwarded does not embrace
all the testimony taken—I have not time to copy all, but from what
is forwarded, you will be enabled to form an opinion of what I have
been doing—The bearer of this communication, is a M. Knight
living in this neighbourhood—I intended to have forwarded this letter
by Mail, but Mr Knight wishes to go on to Tallahassee, I have
thought it best to send this letter by him.
The people settled on the Alachua Grant seem to be very anxious
for me to commence the Survey of Arredondo's Grant, in order that
they may know their respective fates—but anxious to obtain the
best information as regards the place of beginning, I was disposed
to hazzard consequences in seeking this knowledge—and consequently
keep the people in suspense, relative to the place of beginning very
much to my regret. -
You will preceive by the deliberate statement furnished me by
Edward M. Wanton in the presence of David Levy, and the subsequent
testimony in the hand writing of the said Levy which is herewith

enclosed, that there is strong presumption in support of the opin
when I say that I believe M. Wanton has been tampered with.
After a full and fair review of all the testimony taken if the Orig
Grant of Arredondo's is thrown aside in making the survey-
the surest guide left, I feel compelled to adopt the centre of the Alac
Savanna as the centre of the Arredondo Grant, as approach
nearest to the calls of the decree of the Supreme Court of the Un
States. I propose running some Township lines near the Alac
Savanna till I shall hear from you. And so soon as the bearer,
Knight returns shall expect to commence the Survey of the A
dondo Grant. In the mean time if your judgement should point
to you any directions or advice, it would be promptly attended

the Decree of the Supreme Court of the United States must be y

you have come to.—Have nothing to do with the dictates, or opini
of other Sources—I am sorry you have gone to so much unnecess
trouble, but cannot help admiring your industry.—
The evidence you have obtained of the true source of the Alach
is both full and conclusive, and corresponds with the Decree of
Supreme Court of the U. States: for the Savanna alluded to, (:
which must, as near as may be, be placed in the middle of the Gra

than the very location that gave the name Alachua to that Sect
of the Country; and hence no inconvenience from that source
affect you any—If the claimants should be dissatisfied, they m
only seek redress from the United States: you will, therefore, entir
abide by the Decree of the Supreme Court of the United States, a
immediately commence the survey without further hesitation,
placing the Alachua Savanna in the Centre of said Grant.—This

Deposition by Harman H. Holliman *
[November 24, 1832]
In the fall of the Year 1821, I visited the neighborhood of Paines
prarie in Company with Co” James Dell, & his two brothers, M & L.
Dell, & stoped at the house of Edw" M. Wanton, who then resided
about one or two Miles in a Southern direction from Painestown &
about a Quarter of a mile NW. of what was termed at that time by the
white people, Harrison Pond—We remained at Wanton's about two
days, -M Wanton had two or three Small Cabins, having been re-
cently built—and a large log house unfinished—We understood that
Wanton was permitted by the Indians to make this establishment
solely because he intended to erect a store house to trade with the Indi-
ans, & of its being understood by the Indians that he was a British and
not a Spanish Subject, —We understood that M. Wanton, was, at
that time a British Officer, under half pay from the English Govern-
ment—during the time we were at Wanton's there was to have been
a treaty held at Wantons, and Cap" Bell from S*Augustine was the
Commissioner on the part of the United States, to treat with the
Seminole Indians. The treaty with the Indians failed, as they did
not make their appearance at the time and place appointed to hold
the treaty—We did not think it safe to travel thro’, the neighborhood
of Paines Prairie at the time we were there, nor had it been Considered
Safe for white people to travel through that Country for Years
previous to the fall of 1821, in Consequence of the hostility of the
Indians. We were informed that the only Security we had at the time
we were at Wanton's from Indian attack was in Consequence of the
proposed treaty with the Indians, and that under no other pretext
would we have been permitted to pass thro’ the Indian Settlement
about Paines prairie unmolested—We heard of no other white settle-
ment made near Paines prairie or Painestown by the white people,
other than Wanton's previous to the fall of 1821, we passed a place
called Oakhill, about two miles distant from Painestown, in a Northern
direction when we Saw Several old Indian Camps or huts, but did

not discover, nor did we hear of any houses of any description, being
built by White people at that place, or in the neighborhood of the
Surrounding Country, other than those at Wanton's—We saw
Horatio S. Dexter, at Wanton's who stated he was Concerned with
Mr Wanton in the Store that M. Wanton was then building or about
to erect—I left my residence on the S" Marys river, in the month of
Feb 1822, in pursuit of two negroes who were taken by the Seminole
Indians from my father (who was then living in Camden County
Geo) in the Year 1818—I took water at the Cowford (now Known as
Jacksonville) on the S" Johns river & ascended Said river, on my
passage up the S" John's I stoped at a place on the Western bank of
the river, Known as Paladka, where I remained one night—I there
endeavored to procure an Indian Negro named John, as a guide
and interpeter for the purpose of recovering the negroes taken by
the Indians from my father—I failed in procuring the Services of this
negro on account of his having a Sore foot—I found M. Woodruff, &
one or two other men employed whose names I do not recollect–
There was a Storehouse & two or three other houses built of logs
which seemed to have been put up, Six or eight months previous
to my visit at Paladka these houses were built at Paladka, and were
occupied at the time I was there, one of which was inhabited at
the time by M. Woodruff,-M Woodruff, informed me that the
Storehouse was intended as a place of deposite, to Supply the New
York Company with Supplies of previsions &c. for the purpose of
enabling Said Company to form a Settlement West of St Johns
river—He stated that we had explored the Oklawaha, & had found
Some good lands on or about it, and further than this I do not rec-
ollect what was Stated by him, about the Settlement &c. The
Indian negro John above alluded to was Said to have lived at or near
Paladka, & to have been employed by the white people as a guide
& interpreter—After leaving Paladka, which was the latter part
of February 1822, I continued my passage up the St Johns & met
with an Indian negroe named Abram, on the eastern Shore of the
S" John's, on his return from S" Augustine, home, at which time
I employed him to go in pursuit of the Negroes taken by the Indians
from my father, Abram returned in about twenty days from the
Indian Territory, after I left him, with the negroes taken by the
Indians, from my father, and during his absence I remained at a
place Called Hope Hill, in the employment of M Levys manager, a
Frenchman named Rotan, who employed me to assist in getting out
a frame for a building. M. Davis, who was in Company with me in
pursuit of Negroes, & had been from the time I left the St Marys,
was likewise employed by Rotan till, Abram's return. There was

a Mechanic named William Cannowit whom we found at Hope Hill
on our arrival & who informed me that he had been employed to put
up the building for M" Levy—After I got the negroes M. Davis &
myself returned directly to the S" Marys—Hope hill is a Hammock
bluff immediately on the Western Margin of the S" John's about ten
Miles above Lake George by Water—M Levy, was represented to be
a Jew, living in Charlestown S" Carolina.

TALLAHASSEE [December] 23” 1832–
DEAR SIR, The Bearer M Knight is from Alachua and will deliver
you some documents from M Washington who you will perceive is
much at a loss where to commence the Survey of the Alachua Grant.
The Claimants are desirous of taking at the centre, a place called
Miconopa, when the Grant and the Decree of the Supreme Court
calls for a place called Alachua. The difficulty is to ascertain what
is the true centre of Alauchua.
The Grant was confirmed on the Testimony of W. T. Hall who
says that in the month of November 1820 he with two men by the
name of Smith and Lannam arrived at Alachua, and immediately
proceeded to clear land and build houses. That they built two
houses about one and a half miles east of Paynes old Town. These
are the Houses which Washington says in the enclosed letter he is
convinced were built at Pelatka on the St. John's River at least
twenty five miles east of the land now claimed by Arredondo and Son.
Washington is desirous of receiving some instructions from you. He
has taken great pains to inform himself correctly on the Subject, but
he is yet greatly at a loss where to commence. Perhaps after seeing
the papers you may be able to instruct him. I will come to see you
as soon as I have time.

ST: AUGUSTINE E F January 4” 1832. [1833]
SIR, I herewith enclose to you a Contract with Messrs Russ, Roche,
Merlet & Crews to repair the Road from Tallahassee to Pensacola,”
in which you will perceive I have directed the repairs to be made to
the Road commencing at Tallahassee and following the direction
through Quincy, Marianna and Webbville to Oak Hill, which is the
place referred to in your letter of the 3" of August 1832.”
Your letter of the 6* November * reached this place during my
absence on a tour of inspection to the Road from Tallahassee to
Pensacola, and was not received until my return—the enclosed
contract had then been concluded.
In the last paragraph of that letter, you direct that I shall not be
at liberty to depart from the course of the Military Road, and en-
close an estimate made by Capt. Shannon which formed the basis of
the appropriation, by comparing that estimate with the Contract,
you will perceive that the route I have taken is precisely the same
as that which is estimated for by Capt Shannon.
This Road is called the upper route, in travelling from Pensacola
to Tallahassee, it leaves the Military Road a few miles east of the
Choctahachy River, passes through Holmes' Valley, Oak Hill, Webb-
ville, Marianna, crosses the Appalachee at the junction of the Flint
and Chatahooche Rivers, thence through Quincy and enters into the
Military Road about eight miles west of Tallahassee, which is a
distance of about ninety miles.
The upper road passes through a rich and well settled country and
is the route now in general use, as the Military Road (from informa-
tion) is scarcely perceptible in many parts, in consequence of its
passing through a poor and unsettled country.
I was induced to deviate from that portion of the Military Road,
by your reference to the other in your letter of the 3" of August, and
the fact of Capt: Shannon's having already done so and repaired as
far as Oak Hill.
I forward the enclosed letters for your consideration and decision,
and have informed the Contractors that as I have not the authority
to alter the Contract, the subject has been referred to you.”

MARIANNA December 4th 1832
SIR On my journey from Pensacola to this place, I met with
Doctor Crews who informed me that he had in conjunction with
others been appointed by you to carry into effect the Act of Congress
granting an appropriation of $4000 to repair the road from Tallahassee
to Pensacola." I have been appointed the Mail contractor by the
Post Master General, to convey the mail from Tallahassee to Pensa-
cola in Stages and Steam Boat, and it occured to me that as the
appropriation was made by Congress to facilitate the transportation
of the U. S. Mail on that route I suggested the policy to him of
confining the repairs to only so much of the route as the Mail must
necessarily pass over, more particularly as the present route by means
of Steam Boat and Stages, at the time of the passage of the law was
not thought of. It appears that the part of the road on the west
of the Choctahachy river can never be rendered by any amount
of repairs a good and permanent road, in as much as the bridges
over the swamps, will always as has ever proved to be the case be
washed away by the freshets and consequently any money laid out
on the repair of this part of the road must necessarily be thrown
away. The road as it now is, on the west side of the Choctahachy
River is, sufficiently good in its natural state for all neighbourhood
purposes, and as the mail is never any more to pass over that road
there will be no necessity to lay out any part of that appropriation
upon it, which was intended and granted solely and exclusively for
the benefit and repair of that road over which the mail would be
transported. I have taken the liberty to suggest to D* Crews the
policy of refering the subject back to you and with his consent &
request have written to you on the subject. It appears that the
contracting parties are perfectly willing to change the terms of the
contract and act up to the spirit of the law of Congress The Steam
Boat has ascended up the Chocktahachy River as far as Cedar
Bluff about 2% miles from the Cowford, and a road can be cut from

thence to Col: Brights or Col: Russ a distance of 15 miles which will
render the transportation at all times certain & by means of the Steam
Boat more rapid & convenient. It appears also that all the in-
habitants of this and the neighbouring section of county are all in
favor of the change since the arrival of the Steam Boat at the point
above mentioned & the interests of the county generally would be
thoroughly subserved thereby.

H. B. Crews to John L'Engle
WEBBVILLE December 6th 1832
MY DEAR SIR You will no doubt receive the communication of
Col: David B M*Comb at the same time that this will come to hand.
The Statement contained in that letter will I think convince you
of the propriety of adopting the course he has so judiciously sug-
gested, It is only 12 or 14 miles below the road cut by Capt: Shannon
to Cedar Bluff, where the steam boat will land—so that the ballance
of the road to Deer Point near Pensacola will be of no use at all, and
to repair the road or swamp on the west side of the Chocktahachy
River is wholly impracticable, as it is subject to be inundated when-
ever the river is the least up and all the Bridges causeways &c would
be washed away in all probability in ten days after they are made
The distance from the Chocktahachy River to Oak Hill is about
32 miles, as it appears to me to be the object of the Goverment in
making appropriations to make & repair roads to facilitate the
transportation of the mail & to afford conveniences to the inhabitants
of the section of country in which the road will pass over. If such
be the case I am authorised by the gentlemen who are concerned
with me in the contract to state to you, that a part of the appropria-
tion would be lost to repair a Road which will be of no service in
facilitating the transportation of the mail and but of very little service
to the inhabitants. The road from Chocktahachy River to Pensa-
cola cut by Capt Birch & subsequently repaired by Capt: Shannon
is of no use whatever as I suppose it has not been travelled by a dozen
persons since it has been repaired. The road used by the people
to go to Pensacola leaves the above mentioned road a few miles the
other side of Chocktahachy River.
I can only add that the people are much pleased with the sugges-
tions of Col M°Comb & have requested me to make this statement

DEAR SIR In accordance with a wish of Doctor Crews, I beg leave
to give my views relative to the improvements to be put on the road
to Pensacola. The Steam Boat Col: M*Comb informs me, will come
up as far as Cedar Bluff, it not being practicable at present to pro-
ceed further: The road at present the other side of Masters Russ
I understand is sufficiently good for neighbourhood purposes, and
as the object of the present appropriation is to create facilities for
the transportation of the mail & travellers, I think that object will
be better gained by cutting a new road from Russ' Cedar Blufl, than
to expend all the appropriation on the road from Russ' to Pensacola;
indeed from my own observation, I entertain not the slightest doubt
'twould require twice the present amount appropriated to put that
road in repair: If consistent with your ideas of utility & propriety
the course suggested is adopted I presume the object of the appropria-

Holmes Valley to Pensacola so that a stage can be run at all seasons
of the year, in three or four miles of the road through Chocktahatchy
Swamp it will require at least 30 bridges—the Steam Boat is now in
operation, transporting the mail & passengers up the Chocktahatchy
River to Cedar Bluff 10 or 15 miles below Shannons Road (finding it
impossible to run any further up) Now this being the case I would
suggest that a deviation be made from Shannons road, say leave
said road near Maj Langs in Holmes Valley about 9 miles East of
Chocktahatchy & run a direct course from thence to Cedar Bluff
the Steam Boat landing, a distance of about 15 miles through a pine-
barren which will cost a mere trifle which is the only place where
the stages can cooperate with the Steam Boat—If you should adopt
the above plan & expend the appropriation on the road from Talla-
hassee to Cedar Bluff we then should have a first rate road from
Tallahassee to the Steam Boat landing—I would further observe
that the road west of Chocktahatchy has never been, nor will ever
be of any account for running the mail (as the little travel that passes
west takes the upper route) which will now become useless for that
object under the present plan for running the mail from Holmes Wal-

PRESENTMENT OF THE GRAND JURY OF HAMILTON
COUNTY
[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 2 sess.: DS]
[Referred January 7, 1833]
Hammilton County Teritory of Florida
We the Grand Jury for the county and Teritory above writen for
May term 1832 would Present as a grievance the manner in which
our School lands have been laid, or as it so happens to be, in this
County, For the following reasons.
And first the principal part of our lands are verry poor pine Barron,
(as commonly called) and the good land or oak and hickory land, in
small detachments bordered by good pine land. it has happened that
the sixteenth Sections in no one instance has faild to fall in the poor
And un cultivated pine land, with only one exception viz the 16"
section Ranange 14 township 1 east of the meridian and North of the
Base Line which said section is poor pine land thoug cultivated.
Secondly the principal part of our population is poor farming men
and stand in kneed of aid to educate their children and under those
circumstances are deprived of those advantages which we have no
dubt was intended for them for third and lastly we donot believe that
the general Goverment intended to bestow a useless gift when the
sixteenth section in each township was donated to benefit of literature
and learning among the poor and destitute.
Having thus short and simply stated the grounds of this present-
ment of our grievance in this particular. we beg leave to point out
the remedy we desire, which is for the goverment of the United
States to grant the county courts privilege to select any one section
in each township (of Land that has been offered) out of the unsold
land with this restriction allso not to interfear with an individual
improvement with out his or her consent.
We request the honorable court after having examined this our
Presentment to cause a coppy of the same to be forwarded to our
Delegate in Congress

[NA:WD, CO Lets. Recd., H289:ALS]
Quincy, FLORIDA, 8* January 1833.
SIR, The Mail from Tallahassee to Pensacola passes through th
place, twice in each week, and crosses the Apalachicola at a pla
called Aspalaga, about eight miles below the site selected for t.
Arsenal.—It is important to the Ordnance Department, that, t.
Mail be restored to its original route, which crossed the Apalachico
at Mount Vernon, in the vicinity of the Arsenal, whereby the Gover
ment interest; as well as the interests of the Citizens, would be bett
consulted, than by the existing arrangement. The letters &c fro
the Ordnance Office, would then be regularly received at the Arsen:
twice in each week. The proposed change of route, will not requi
the expenditure of a single additional dollar.
I transmit herewith, a hand bill ” which has just made its appea
ance here, and which clearly indicates the public sentiment in relatio
to this subject. The Mail contractors evidently believe, that, the
shall be ordered by the Postmaster General, to pass by the Arsen
on the old route, and have published their advertisement accordingl
The point on the Apalachicola which they have indicated as the pla
of meeting of the Mail Steam Boats and stages, is decidedly the mo
eligible for that purpose, and, as the interests of the Ordnance D
partment are involved in this matter, I respectfully solicit, that yo
will invite the attention of the Postmaster General to this subjec

ROBERT W. WILLIAMS TO JOHN S. SKINNER
[LC: Jackson Papers, Vol. 82:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE Jan' 9" 1833
DEAR SIR, Your favor of 18" ulti has been received, with its en-
closure which I have handed over to the individual to whom it was
directed.
You enquire “if there is any prospect of doing any thing in the
Gen” affairs in Florida.” In consequence of the appalling stagna-
tion in business of every description in our Country, and especially
in Selling lands, owing cheifly to the sickness of the last two years,
I have not been able to effect any sales at prices, which in justice to
Gen Lafayette and good faith to you, I could think of accepting—
I have had some offers for lands which three years ago could readily
have been sold for one hundred per cent more than has been offered;
the value of landed property is now at its lowest ebb, and sales
made or forced at this time, must be at an entire sacrafice.
The flattering prospects of health the ensuing year, and the rise
in the article of cotton from 8 cts for the crop of last year, to 10" for the
present Crop, will, we anticipate, greatly increase the demand for good
land, and consequently enhance the prices.
I wrote you last July, in detail, in regard to the conditional arrange-
ment of affairs with the french settlers, and requested you would
immediately forward my letter to Gen L. and desire of him an early
anSWer.
The terms of the sale to the settlers were based upon their expartee
statements of verbal contracts which they alledge to have made
with the General, our contracts were of course made subject to the
approval of Gen Lafayette. The price agreed upon for the land would
have been considered high in the best of times, but the time, and par-
tial payments, in advance, which they charge to have been made,
I could not consent to, as there was no evidence in my possession that
authorised me to admit either. Every fact was given minutely and

at length in my letter to Gen L. that no misunderstanding should
exist, and we have been in anxious expectancy of his answer. When
I had the honor of receiving my appointment from you, I found a
charge against the land for taxes of $493, and the tax collector about
to advertise it for the payment of them, I had necessarily to advance
the money at once to avoid further expense, and be assured, I will
not sell lands for less than I think them worth, merely to reimburse
myself. -
Immediately after the receipt of my authority, I investigated the
sales made by M. Graham, with the consent of Gen Lafayette, to
Mess Doyle & Caruthers, being 160 acres to each, and discovered an
error in the deed to the latter, which conveyed a quarter in a adjoining
town, when the land sold and intended to be conveyed was % of a
mile off—Mr Caruthers it seems bought at $4 pracre, whilst for the
tract conveyed I should refuse less than $10, as the quarter immedi-
ately adjoining was sold to Mr Doyle for that sum cash; I have
succeeded in getting the first deed cancelled, and have given a new
one for the tract actually sold.
I have recently had an application, by letter, from Gov Branch,
to buy one section of land; in consequence of the relationship existing
between us, I declined selling to him on any terms, but advised him
to apply to you on the subject, and propose that you get two or more
disinterested persons to value the land, and if both parties should
be satisfied with the price that may be agreed upon, let the sale
be Consumated by you, or by myself under instructions from you.
Please consider me a subscriber to the Turf Register.

Sir In order to prevent the necessity of my making another report
by order of the War Dep. I deem it adviseable to forestall it by en-
closing to you a copy of a correspondence with M. Greene of this
place.—
One of the soldiers was enticed by a man named Harris to desert;
he went for the purpose into a boat belonging to the sheriff, of which
Harris had charge. The sheriff was informed of it, went with a
party took him out, stripped, tied & whipped his back almost to a
jelly.—When brought up here I went to see him, & told him he had
nothing more than his deserts for an attempt to run off—The soldiers
however, as it appears were much exasperated & went into town the
succeeding night under a concerted & deliberate plan to catch the
sherif as well as Harris who chastised the man.—the latter they found
in a grog shop and inflicted punishment on him; the sheriff made his
escape. I was sick at the time and heard nothing of the transaction
until late the ensuing morning: when I directed such steps to be
taken as to prevent if possible a recurrence of such another affair. I
understand that, altho there was much alarm in town, no person was
further insulted than giving them a positive order to keep off & not
interfere. I must say here, that since it has happened without my
knowledge and that I am bound to use my endeavors to prevent its
going further; I do regret that, whilst they were at it, they had not
met the sheriff who flogged a man without any hearing.
I have the honor to be very Respy Yo Mob S"

SIR.—I take this method of respectfully reporting to you, that an

object of assaulting some of the Citizens.—Indeed the officer was
heard by several to order all citizens whom they met to be attacked.—
A proceeding so violent has created a great excitement among the
Citizens many of whom from the fear of its recurrence have applied
to me as the senior Militia officer of this County for protection.
Confident that an investigation by you of this affair, will ensure them
the security they seek, I shall take no steps in my official capacity

SIR, By Mr Prior I received your communication of the 8"—In-
disposition, from which I have not yet entirely recovered, prevented
my answer until this time: and indeed I have not yet been able to in-
vestigate the facts as far as I could wish. The only two individuals
that I could learn had committed an overt act in the case, I ordered
to be instantly confined, where they shall remain until I can see
farther into the subject; & I hope to find a correspondent manifesta-
tion on the part of the civil authorities to preserve peace by an
energetic execution of their own laws.
It is well known to all that I am unable, by my restricted force,
to form a cordon of sentinels around the quarters so as to prevent the
soldiers from going out at night: It is equally well known that men in
their situation will resort to the grog shops for exhiliration; and it is
as well known that with few exceptions, your grog sellers will make a
soldier beastly drunk, provided he receives the money in hand, or
had previously received a full equivalent in labour. Under such cir-
cumstances what can be expected—I submit this for your considera-
tion as well as for the consideration of the “many” whose fears—
you say—had induced them to apply to you as senior militia officer
of the County; but I would further ask what civil officer, or citizen,

except in the cases of Mr Prior & Mr Weaver, have ever brought
to justice a man for vending ardent spirits to soldiers in the face of
Territorial & City laws? I believe there are none on record.
I would now ask whether your City authorities are sunk so low as
to permit a petty sheriff of an hours or a day's standing, to assume
the office of Dictator & take a man, have him tied, stripped & scourged
almost to a jelly, merely because he was in a passion, & the man had
no person to protect him: and this even without a hearing of his case,
nor any application to a civil Magistrate? No person could wonder
at the result: I only wonder that the sheriff did not come into the
affray as I understand he was quite stout hearted the ensuing morning
& for marching up here.—
I submit the foregoing to you sir, for your calm consideration &
with no intention of reflecting on yourself, to whom I feel thankful
for the manner in which you addressed me your note of the 8th Inst.

P.S.. I shall certainly endeavour to prevent a recurrence of the
scenes that took place on the 7" but cannot be answerable for con-
sequences if such another outrage should be perpetrated as was by
the Sheriff. The Soldier who inflicted the blows on the man is a
sober, quiet, but deliberate & firm man. I have no doubt but that
some of the N. C. officers were nearly present at the transaction &
encouraged it, but cannot tell who they were to a certainty—J.M.G.

[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Apalachicola:]
WASCESSA 28 January 1833
SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your letter
of the 19 ulto" and to express my gratification on the approval by
the President & yourself of the manner in which I have executed the
duties entrusted to me—Blunts party left the Appalachicola some
weeks since on their explorations west, and were accompanied by two
or three of the Younger chiefs of Mulatto King, & Econchatimeco's
Town—On their return I will seek an early opportunity of renewing
my negotiations with those chiefs for the removal of themselves &
followers west; and should they then decline, I will proceed to the
enrollment of the Younger Chiefs & Warriors who may be disposed to
migrate on the terms suggested & approved in my previous communi-
cation to you—In the mean time I would draw your attention to the
additional article of the Treaty of Camp Moultrie, with a view of
ascertaining your opinion whether the terms of that article would
recognise a division of the reservations of land between the old Chiefs
& those preferring to remain with them; & those Younger chiefs &
Warriors who may be disposed to migrate on receiving payment for
the proportional part allotted them—In the several communications
held with them, I have rather encouraged the probability of such
an arrangement, in addition to each Chief & Warrior enrolled, re-
ceiving in advance their proportion of the annuity under the Treaty of
Camp Moultrie & a commutation in money for their expenses of
removal subsistence &c &c, as was allowed in the agreement with
Blunt The division of land, if made, would have to be graduated,
I should suppose, according to the rank & consequence of the Chiefs
& Warriors, as has been the practice in the distribution of the an-
nuity—Indeed that distribution may be the standard of the land
apportionment, as it has been long recognised by the Indians—An
idea however prevails among the Younger Chiefs & Warriors disposed
to migrate & composing a decided majority of the Towns, that they
may in council depose the Old Chiefs Mulatto & Econchatimeco, and
thus have the authority themselves of selling the reservations &
forcing these older chiefs, reduced to the station of subjects, to mi-
grate with them—This movement has been agitated in their private
meetings, but in consultations with me I have discountenanced it;
believing it to be the wish of the Executive of the US, not to encourage
divisions among his Red Men, but rather to convince by argument
that the policy of the General Government in removing them west
originated in the most humane feelings for their happiness & future

preservation—No other language have I held in all my negotiations
with the Florida Indians & I have the satisfaction to state that the
appeal when properly interpreted & fairly comprehended, has never
been without its effect The difficulties encountered thus far with
the Appalachicola bands, two of them at least, may be ascribed to
the force of secret and interested influences, but these are in a fair
way of being properly understood by the Indians themselves, who in
having the film removed from their eyes will not be slow in under-
standing their real interests & in recognising their true friends

The Petition of the undersigned Citizens of the Territory of Florida
respectfully sheweth, that for several years past the legislation of the
said Territory has been calculated materially to disturb the peace
and happiness and to injure the property of the ceded inhabitants of
the late provinces of Spain who are by the Treaty now Citizens of the
United States. Your Petitioners are aware that the evils of which
they complain have not arrisen from any thing inherent in the insti-
tutions and Laws of the United States, but have their origin in the
illiberal prejudices of a local government totally at variance with the
liberal spirit and generous policy of the nation and age in which we
live: it will not be necessary for us in appealing to so intelligent a
body as the one we address, to say that every nation and people have
particular customs and habits which if not at War with the institu-
tions of other countries are universally viewed with great toleration
and indulgence. This principle has been carried so far in other coun-
tries where there was an established religion that the ceded inhabi-

tants were permitted to retain theirs. There are doubtless some
practises in all countries tolerated by National indulgencies that may
not be approved by all the people of the United States; but those are
diseases of the body politic to be changed by example and public
sentiment and not by the nostrums of political quackery which will
nauseate and disgust every one whose misfortune it has been to be
transfered to the United States.
The laws to which your Memorialists chiefly object as coming
under the designation above mentioned are mostly those of the last
Session of Council relating to free people of color: it cannot have
escaped the observation of your honorable body that in all slave-
holding countries some portion of the population and not a very
inconsiderable part have without the formalities of Marriage cere-
monies, children by colored women. in all Spanish countries they were
free and admitted to most of the rights of Spanish subjects especially
to the natural and inherent right of legal protection from which they
are now excluded: however these practises may be at variance with
the national prejudices of a portion of the United States they existed
in the recently aquired country and are not to be extinguished at
once by intolerance and persecution or any other moral or political
fanaticisim: These evils are not to be rooted out by legal penalties
any more than faith is to be controuled by the terrors of the Inqusi-
tion and a resort to the one is no more to be justified than to the
other. The Legislative Council of Florida however acting upon the
idea of bringing every thing to their own standard of moral perfec-
tion: as the Tyrant of antiquity did to His bed, have denounced
penalties and imposed taxes on this class of population only on ac-
count of their color: These unfortunate people are not only required
to pay the usual taxes which other citizens pay but they are required
to pay from five to ten dollars each on both sexes over fifteen years
of age because of their color, in addition, and to be sold as slaves for
life if they should be too poor to pay these odious and unequal taxes;
besides being outlawed and excluded from all legal redress for injuries
done either to their persons or properties: connected with this also
is a law to break up all those paternal obligations and ties of natural
affection which have existed for years past by imposing a fine of one
thousand dollars with the penalty of disfranchisement upon every
White person who is suspected of having a connexion with a coloured
woman and the like penalty for inter-marying with any person sus-
pected to be of colored origin or for performing such ceremony.
The Legislative Acts of Florida are now replete with many cruel
and unjust laws but those of mental persecution and proscription for
the virtuous and sacred ties of domestic life and parental affection

provision and under and by virtue of the Authority of certain Acts
of the Congress of the United States passed for the purpose of carrying
into Execution the requisitions of the 8* Article aforesaid of said
Treaty, a final decree was made in the Supreme Court of the United
States at its term of Session for the year 1832, and entered upon the
Record of said Court as of the 17* March 1832* Confirming unto the
claimants and proprietors of said grant so above stated to have been
to the Arredondos, their legal and Equitable rights and title in and to
the property and possession of the tract of Land by them claimed to
have been vested by the terms of said Grant, the centre whereof was
adjudged in said decree to be the same as that which in said grant was
designated and described to be such centre. That by force of testi-
mony connected with the history and topography of the country in
which said grant is situated, supported and made clear by the testi-
mony of all the old Inhabitants of the Country it is settled conclusively
and demonstratively that the place formerly Known as the town of
Alachua “inhabited in other times as the Chief or Capital town of the
Seminole Nation of Indians, and at the present day Known by the
name of Micanopa, was the place evidently by the terms and phrase-
ology of the grant, contemplated by it to be such central point, and
was consequently the same place intended by the decree of the
Supreme Court aforesaid to be fixed upon as such; but that neverthe-
less, disregarding the strict right of the owners of said tract, the
Surveyor deputed on behalf of the United States to execute the inten-
tion of the decree aforesaid by locating said tract in conformity to
the terms of the grant, and separating it from the public demain,
hath made Known an intention to adopt as the central point of said
grant a place different and distant from the true centre as above
described: Now therefore the Proprietors and owners as aforesaid of
the grant aforesaid holding it as evident that the place above stated

by them to be the centre of their grant aforesaid is indeed the only
true centre, and that therefore the selection of any other place than
that above described as such centre would be in direct and palpable
violation of the true intent and meaning of the terms of the grant by
which said property was originally vested in the grantees; and in equal
violation of the like intent and meaning of the decree of the Supreme
Court by which as aforesaid, said grant has been confirmed as valid
to the claimants; that it would be, as they think, unsupported and
unwarranted by any admissible testimony or ground of Justification
whatever, and would operate injuriously to the owners of said grant,
to which they cannot in Justice to themselves yield their consent, do
hereby positively absolutely, and unequivocally object to such pro-
ceeding of the said Surveyor, and declare that they will not consent to
the adoption of any other place as the centre of their grant save the
single one aforementioned, which, as seems clear to them, is the only
true and proper one, earnestly protesting as they do hereby protest
against any attempt to proceed in a survey of said tract which does
not start from said place abovementioned as a centre, declaring that
any such attempt will be considered a departure from the authority
by which the Surveyor would undertake to enter upon and survey
said grant, and that therefore any and all proceedings had in prosecu-
tion of such Illegal Attempt will be deemed and held to be an intrusion;
and that no survey of any tract by said Surveyor made, differing from
that which in these premises is stated to be in the opinion of the
proprietors the proper one, will be at all assented to or concured in,
but will be wholly rejected as Illegal and unauthorised; hereby
cautioning said Surveyor that in any proceeding on his part by which
he shall attempt to prosecute a survey so herein above objected to,
he will be acting in his own wrong and at his own risk.

Butler has given peremptory orders to Survey the Alachua Grant,

MAGNOLIA Feby 6th 1833
SIR I find, from the expenses in St Marks Harbour being greater
than I had estimated for and which from the nature of the work
could not be made with much precission,” that the funds now avail-
able for the river will not be quite sufficient to enable me to effect
the improvement of it to the point most desirable and practicable—
The amount above the available funds for this work, as near as I can
estimate will be $1500.00 wich could be expended to the best advan-
tage if it could be obtained at the present session of congress: either
to have the work done this season, should the state of the river allow,
or to effect it early next fall which would answer all the purposes of
the improvement
I have been some time apprehensive that more money would be
necessary for this work, but until the present I have thought that I
could effect the object with the means now at command. This is my
apology for asking, at this late period a further appropriation of
$1500.”—

at and above the natural bridge, the public lands contiguous to said
river are rendered of much less value than they would be were said
obstructions removed; and in consequence a great portion of the
same have been unsold, and yet remain the property of the U. S.–
And whereas the settlement, growth and property of the Territory
is thereby greatly retarded; and whereas upon a survey of said river
by an Engineer of the U.S: it has been estimated that the obstruc-
tion at the natural bridge could be removed by the judicious expendi-
ture of ten thousand dollars—And whereas in consequence of the
General Government being the principal proprietor of the property
which will be benefitted by said work, it is considered that Congress
should make the necessary appropriation for the same—And whereas
the people of the Territory memoralized Congress at its last Session
for such aid (the same being transmitted to the Delegate from Florida
for presentation) and as it is highly important to the Citizens, resident
contiguous to said river, that such improvements in the navigation
should be made as early as possible.—
Be it therefore resolved, by the Legislative Council of Florida,
That the Delegate in Congress from said Territory be requested to
use his efforts to have such appropriation made at the present Session
of Congress; and that the Chief Clerk forward forthwith this preamble
and resolutions to him—
And be it further resolved, That the President of the Council for-
ward another Copy thereof, to the Delegation in Congress from the
State of Georgia, and respectfully call their attention to, and solicit

RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL RE HARBOR
OF FERNANDINA
[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 2 sess.:DS"]
[February 9, 1833]
Whereas The harbor of Fernandina in East Florida, situated at the
mouth of the River St Mary's uniting by a convenient and easily
improved inland communication with the Nassau and St Johns
Rivers and having eighteen feet water on its bar at ordinary tides, is
among the most secure and capacious on the Southern seaboard of
the United States and is also at a point where the uniform mildness of
the climate is only excelled by its salubrity, and from whence through
the waters of the above named rivers especially the St. Johns certain
and safe access may at all times be had to the immense stores of pine
Cypress—cedar and Live Oak, abounding upon the peninsula of
Florida—as well as to its richer if not more abundant products of
sugar cotton and other staples which the arts of agriculture and
extensive tracts of Land now about to be opened, must hereafter,
present for market
And Whereas It may greatly contribute to the security and per-
manent prosperity of the south and thereby to the general interests
of the Union as well as to the special advancement of commerce and
agriculture in this Territory that a point of such commanding im-
portance should no longer be neglected by the general government;
but that now, while the exercise of its powers, in Florida, can be
embarrassed by no question of conflicting jurisdiction or of doubtful
constitutional right, they should be extended to it, with a view, both
to local benefit and national utility
Wherefore be it resolved by the Legislative Council of Florida
That our Delegate in Congress be, and he is hereby requested to use
his best exertions to procure the passage of a Law establishing a Port
of Entry—and providing for, and establishing a Naval depot, with
suitable military works and fortifications for the protection thereof,
at said Fernandina.

SIR You are already apprised that the suit of Mitchel & others
against the U. States, which involves the title to a very large tract of
land in the Territory of Florida, stands for argument at the present
term of the Supreme Court—and that there are also several cases
from Missouri founded upon alledged grants or concessions from the
Spanish authorities.—It has been supposed that there are original
official papers in possession of the Colonial authorities of Cuba which
would probably throw light on claims of this description & assist the
Court in coming to a just conclusion.—Will you have the goodness to
say whether it is probable that these papers will be obtained by the
Government before the next Term of the Supreme Court and whether
the dispatches from our agent at Havanna furnish sufficient grounds
for believing, that the papers yet to be delivered may affect materially
the decision on the claim of Mitchell & others—I make it therefore
my duty to ask for a continuance of the case *

The memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Flori
to the Congress of the United States, respectfully represents:
That your memoralists feel great pleasure and satisfaction, at
near approach of that desirable and happy period in our governme
when the public debt will all have been paid, and those means wh
have been pledged for its redemption, will be at the disposition of
government, to be applied to other objects, while this debt, wh
was created in defence of the just rights of this government exist
your memoralists were unwilling to urge the disposition of any of
means which were pledged for its payment, notwithstanding
peculiar situation of this territory, might have authorized them to
so, now that this debt is all paid but a small balance, and ampleme:
are provided for that, and as the subject of disposing of the pul
lands, occupies a part of the attention of your honorable body, y.
memoralists consider it a proper time, to ask for such legislation up
the subject, as the peculiar situation of this country, and the inter
of its inhabitants, so strongly demand.

Florida has a seacoast, nearly equal in extent, to the whole atlantic
coast of the United States. A large portion of it is uninhabited, and
less protected from foreign aggression than any other portion of the
Union. To attempt to fortify all the accessable points, would be an
almost endless expense. It would therefore seem to your memoralists
to be desirable to the government to have the country settled as
densely as possible; most of the lands now unsold, never would be
purchased at the present price asked by the government, and con-
sequently a very great proportion of them would remain perhaps
forever unsettled. Your memoralists therefore respectfully request
that some law may be passed, giving to all persons who have, or who
may hereafter settle on public lands, one quarter section, or such
other portion as may be deemed reasonable. The beneficial con-
sequences that would inevitably result from such a measure, must
be so obvious, that it would be useless to point them out. Besides
greatly increasing the valuable agricultural productions of the country,
no measure would cause a more rapid increase of that kind of popula-
tion, who would develope the resources of the country, and who are
so ready to defend their rights and liberties. All wisely regulated
governments have uniformly extended encouragement to its indus-
trious and enterprizing citizens, and none are more worthy than those,
who by their agricultural pursuits, develope the riches of the country.
“The wealth and strength of a country are its population, and the
last part of that population are the cultivators of the soil.”
Resolved, That a copy of this memorial be transmitted to the
Delegate in Congress from this Territory—which were read and
adopted.

equivalent to be subsequently rendered, under any circumstances
whatever; and as you are individually responsible to the Treasury

SIR, In answer to your letter on the subject of the papers expected
from Cuba, and appertaining to the Archives of Florida, and to those
requested to be furnished by the Spanish Government, I can add
little to what I have said in answer to a letter from the Attorney
General, which has been communicated to you, on the same subject.—
By letters received two day's since from the Agent sent to the
Havana, to demand the Archives by virtue of a royal Order given
for that purpose to the Governor General,” I am led to expect his
(the agent's) arrival in a few days, and that he will bring with him,
a list of such papers as he has discovered to be in the Havana; and
from former letters some of them related to the powers given to the
Governors, or Intendents of Florida in relation to the grants of
land.—
From Spain I am in daily expectation of the return of a special
Messenger, who will, in all probability, bring with him the answer
of the Spanish Government to the application for the papers which
were required by the Supreme Court,” and there is great reason to
believe from the friendly disposition expressed by the present Min-
ister for foreign affairs that such answer will be satisfactory.—
The opinion expressed in the close of my letter to the Attorney
General, that the interest of the U.S. might require the production
of those papers, was entirely founded on the fact of their being thought

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of

You will consider yourself as positively limited to the appropriation
for the Survey now under your direction, and on no account exceed
it, as expenditures beyond the amount appropriated will not be
passed to your credit. And should this amount prove to be inade-
quate to complete the Survey, you will take such a general view of the
part incompleted, as will enable you to present its prominent features
in the form of a report, and furnish the data from which an estimate
may be made for a future continuation of the Survey.
You will exercise your discretion in superintending suspending
operations should the time required to make the survey extend to the
sickly season, in which case you will repair with your assistants to
this city. But as the locality of this duty is so distant it is extremely
desirable that you should do all that may be in your power, before
the period for the exercise of the discretion now reposed in you may
arrive.*

[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 10]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs, March 16. 1833.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your several
letters of the 1st * 2nd * and 3rd Inst * with their respective en-
closures, and will briefly reply to their various topics in the order
they are therein mentioned.
Mr. Richards having been substituted in the place of the former
Interpreter, and you considering it expedient to employ one, he will
be continued as such, until you shall think it advisable to dispense
with his services.
The charge of 300$ to reimburse you for expenses incurred in feed-
ing and providing for Indians at your Superintendency, will under the
circumstances of the Case be allowed by the Secretary of War—The
rule governing such charges was not intended to be inflexible in its
application, but as a prevention of ill-founded claims.—The Secretary
is perfectly satisfied of your alledged expenditure, and cannot refuse
the allowance of your charge.
The item of 115$, for building an Office at the Agency in the
Seminole Nation, and charged in J. Phagan's account will be allowed
on your recommendation for its payment, coupled with the Certifi-
cates of Capt Graham and Erastus R. Rogers, Esqr.
Colo. Gadsden has also recommended Mr. William Pope as Agent,
and as well as yourself speaks with much emphasis of the expediency
of such an Appointment. The Secretary of War coincides in senti-
ment with you in this particular, and considers the appointment of
an Agent an act of justice to the Indians, and calculated to prevent
a repetition of outrageous conduct alike illegal and disgraceful. The
appointment of Mr. Pope is left to yourself, and his compensation
will be 500$ per annum. He will not be considered a regular Sub-
Agent, but his duties will be similar, and he will use his utmost exer-
tions to prevent intrusion and outrage of every description. You will
be pleased to furnish him with instructions necessary for the faithful
discharge of his official duties.

JOHN HILLS TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File: ALS]
MoUNT VERNON, Flo: 28th March 1833.
SIR, I deem it my duty to represent to you, that, the road on the
West bank of the Apalachicola, immediately opposite to this place,
and for the improvement of which, an appropriation has been made
by Congress," is extremely bad, and remains so during the greater
part of the year. I have examined the ground at different times, and
am satisfied, that, a bridge across the bayou will shorten the travel,—
make a better road, -and, with a causeway, will remain good through-
out the year. The Mail Stage from Tallahassee to Pensacola passes
over this road, four times per week.
I transmit herewith, a letter from M* Russ addressed to Mr King,"
the former of whom, is, I understand, the Contractor to repair the
road under the appropriation referred to. I also transmit a sketch
of the ground furnished me by M. King. The yellow track” repre-
sents the present travelled route on the bank of the river, in rich
alluvial, which, in wet weather is rendered almost inpassable, and, in
this rich soil, remains so for many weeks. The red track” represents
a better route, and shews the proposed bridge across the bayou.
From the bridge to the ferry, the road must have a causeway in
several places. Beyond the bridge, the road soon strikes into a high
pine-barren. The cost of a road in this kind of soil, consists merely
in felling the pine trees to the proposed width of the road, and in
removing the stumps.
I have considered it a matter of duty to bring this subject to your
notice, because of the establishment of an Arsenal at this place," and
* Not present. * Not present.
* On the sketch the upper track [the inverted V] is colored yellow.

* An appropriation of $20,000 to begin the construction of an arsenal in Florida
was made by act approved Apr. 5, 1832 (4 STAT. 502). Hills, who had made a
survey to locate a site for the arsenal in 1831, was placed in charge of its construc-
tion by direction of the Chief of Ordnance, July 19, 1832 (NA, WD, CO Lets.

Towns on the Appalachicola be governed by the views therein ex-
pressed—In writing on that subject it was to obtain more explicit

the Sec" War—I was not insensible to the “doubtful policy & practical
difficulty” of such an arrangement as the Younger chiefs were
solicitous of making of their supposed interest in the reservation held
in common with the older chiefs not so willing at present to migrate-

the other Towns who accompanied the expedition seem much pleased
and have made such representations as may induce, in thier opinion,
Econchatimeco & Vacapasacy to listen more favourably to the prop-
ositions from our government—They have invited me to visit once
more their Towns and make another assay towards a negotiation-I
shall accordingly leave this in a few days for that purpose & hope to
report to you a final & successful result—
Blunt has sought two or three interviews with me of late, all relating
to subject connected with the future execution of the engagement
he has entered into for the removal of himself & followers West. As
he is now anxious to commence the preparations necessary for his
migration, it may be important to give to the Executive of the Terri-

SIR I herewith inclose you my Monthly Report of operations on
St Marks River and Harbour for March 1833, together with my
account current of expenditures for the same, & for funds remaining
in my Hands of the appropriation for Apalachicola River, with the
United States.
The improvement in the Harbour at the Devils Elbow has been
completed as far as the funds available for that purpose would allow
& I had hoped as far as would be necessary for the trade of the place.
But I have been able to get but 9 feet of water through the cut when
10% or 11 feet is desired. I was in hopes that once blasting over the
bed of the cut, weighing the rock broken up & dredging, would have
secured this debth, but the nature of the rock is such that the blasting
did not produce sufficient effect for this purpose and it will require
to be gone over with again, for which I shall make an estimate for
another appropriation should you deem it proper to ask for it. 300
cubic yards of rock was removed by the work of blasting that has
been done.
The improvements of the river above have gone on as well as pos-
sible during the month; the water being too high to work at the best
advantage; and now it will be necessary to suspend further opera-

within about two miles of the point where it is contemplated to
terminate the work: to complete which and deepen parts of the

to extend the Surveys South on the Atlantic, as far as Lake George
connecting with the surveys heretofore made on the west of and

that I must travel for the restoration of my health,” I am very

last, to enable me to place it in such a situation by confidential attor-
ney as will secure its payment to my Deputies when they shall have
made returns, previous to my coming back—The amount under
contract will be almost 7.000 miles which together with the contin-
gencies will require upwards of 28.000$ as previously indicated—

SIR, I have the honor to send you enclosed a letter from Gen'Call
in relation to the compensation of the Law Agent of the U. States in
Florida for the last year." From the number of the Suits depending
in that Territory against the U. States, brought on concessions and
grants of land alleged to have been made by the Spanish authorities
I am satisfied that the greater portion of the time of the agent, for the
last year must have been occupied in attending to the duties of his
agency—And from the manner in which the business appears to have
been conducted on the part of the public as well as from the statement
of Gen'Call I am convinced that the duties of the agent have been
diligently and faithfully performed. The sum of $1500 is in my
opinion not more than a reasonable and fair compensation for the

SIR I have the honor to transmit to you my Returns and accounts
of the 1* Quarter of the present Year, for the Quarter Masters Dept:
and the several roads under my superintendence.
The repairs to the Road from Jacksonville to Alachua Court House
will be completed on the 16" of this Month, when I shall commence
on the Old Kings Road, I should have immediately complied with
the instructions contained in your letter of the 15" of Feb: " had
* James Arden, W. H. Williams, Paul Masters, and others of Mosquito Co.
represented to the Quartermaster General, Feb. 1833, that the road had become
impassable, particularly the bridges, and requested that it be repaired. No
copy of the letter was retained; it is entered in NA(WD, QMG Reg. of Lets.
Recd.). In acknowledging the letter, the Quartermaster General stated that
Lt. L’Engle had been instructed regarding the matter on Apr. 5 (NA, WD, QMG
Lets. Sent, Bk. 18).

of appropriations to the roads for which the appropriations were made. A letter
from L'Engle to the Quartermaster General, Jan. 31, 1833, had stated the balance
for the Old Kings Road to be $1181.75 and that for the road from Marianna to
Alagua $110 (NA, WD, QMG Lets. Recd., L. 27). See also L’Engle to the
Quartermaster General, May 1, 1833 (loc. cit., L. 88), with information that the
Jacksonville-Alachua C. H. road was finished.

the amount applicable to the Old Kings Road been sufficient to
authorize the purchase of the necessary tools implements and means
of transportation to carry on the work, but as it was not, I thought
it advisable not to commence until the completion of the Jacksonville
Road, that I might avoid the necessity of purchasing another outfit.
As to the balance of $110 remitted to me for the Road from Alaqua
to Mariana, the amount is too small to enable me to make any appli-
cation of it on that Road, my transportation there would almost
amount to that sum, I have therefore deemed it proper to defer
until I receive further instructions from you.
In my Quarterly Return of Quarter Masters Stores, you will per-
ceive I have reported a mule lost by death. I presume a certificate
of the fact is necessary. I will forward one as soon as I can procure
it. I did not think it proper to delay my accounts for the want of it.

SIR, The treaty with Appalachicola bands of Indians, concluded
October 11" 1832," having been ratified "I will thank you to inform
them of the fact and of the expectation of the Government, that they
will remove from the land by the 1st day of November next, agree-
ably to the stipulations of the treaty. It is not known here why
this provision cannot be carried into effect. Should however unavoid-
able circumstances in the words of that instrument occur to prevent
the Indians from going they will be allowed to remain for another
year. But before any assurances upon that subject are given to
them you will report those circumstances should they be alledged to
exist, to this Department, where they will be judged of and the matter
determined. If the Indians evince an unnecessary desire to remain,
I will thank you to discourage their expectations as far as proper,
and inform them distinctly that the case presented must be a very
strong one, before the Government will assent to their continuance.

15th April 1833.
ROB" BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 31* ultimo wherein you state
as follows:"
“In furtherance of your instructions I have succeeded in making out
new general and special instructions and contracts together with the
necessary notice to private claimants, and the diagrams necessary
shewing the ground each Deputy will occupy, a copy of which is fur-
nished the Keeper of the archives at St. Augustine for the information
of said claimants and the notice directed to be printed in paper of that
place.” I have to request that copies of these diagrams contracts
and instructions may be sent also to this Office.
You further state—“I have now dispatched seven deputies, one of
whom I hope to see in a few days, to make return of the Arredondo
grant, when he will be again under orders to fill his niche in the present
arrangement.” "
You further state—“I am hourly expecting the arrival of another
under orders, and there are two finishing the work remaining on the
West of the Apalachicola, and the Bays of St. Joseph and St. Andrews,
when they will be sent East to complete my present design, which is,
to extend the surveys South on the Atlantic as far as Lake George,
connecting with the surveys heretofore made on the West of, and con-
tiguous to, the St. Johns river, as far South as the mouth of the
Oaklawaha, and parallel with the Arredondo grant,”
In reference to these various objects of survey you request to be
furnished with funds to the amount of seventeen thousand dollars
“to enable me to place it in such a situation by confidential attorney
as will secure its payment to my deputies when they shall have made
returns previous to my coming back.” You further state, that the
amount under contract will be almost seven thousand miles “which
will require upwards of $28,000 as previously indicated.”

of the 13" March preceding, "you represented that there were due to
this Office and to the Registers of the Eastern and Western Districts,
plats of nearly One hundred townships which were then nearly ready
to be forwarded, besides which there were thirteen townships East of
the Meridian which had been sectioned, and which you represented to
have been recently returned to your Office, the plats of which had
not been made out; besides these were the re-surveys on the Escambia
river and its vicinity. Such being the arrears of your Office already
existing, I am apprehensive that you have undertaken more work
than your Office, under the circumstances of the existing arrears, your
own feeble health, and intended absence from official labors will have
the means of controlling.
The rendering of the returns of surveys now due to this Office, and
the District land Offices is a duty which should have taken precedence
of any other, or which should not be interfered with by duties of a
subsequent date.
You propose that the sum of $17.000 which you require to make
payment for surveys now in course of execution shall be placed in
the hands of a confidential Attorney to secure its payment to your
deputies during your absence. This course of proceeding is utterly
inadmissible. The accounts of a Deputy Surveyor cannot be closed
until his field notes shall have been examined and the accuracy thereof
tested by actual protraction in the Office of the Surveyor General.
The Department holds each Surveyor General responsible under
his bond for all payments made to his deputies, and no Surveyor
General is credited in the Settlement of his accounts at the Depart-
ment, with the vouchers of his Deputy Surveyors until the evidence
of the due performance of the service is filed in this Office.
In the execution of the duties of your Office, the Department ex-
pects that you will rigidly adhere to the specific instructions heretofore
given. I am apprehensive that there has been much bad surveying
in Florida, and the utmost precaution must be used in the making of
future surveys; and in case any of your Surveyors have been detected
in slighting their work under former contracts, such must not be
continued in the public service. You are requested to proceed no
further with the surveys than you have means in your Office of making
the necessary critical examinations of the field notes for the same
within a reasonable time after the surveys are completed, and prior
to the settlement of the accounts of the Deputies. To effect these
objects, and at the same time to bring up the existing arrears in
your Office, it matters not how much the surveying operations have

necessarily to be restricted, inasmuch as the Government would
prefer delay in the execution of the public surveys rather than incur
the risk of having them badly executed.
Under all these circumstances, I do not feel justified in drawing on
the Secretary of the Treasury for the whole amount of the funds you
require, until you shall enable me to lay before him explicit informa-
tion as to the mode in which the money is to be applied—that is to
say: the number of townships to be paid for—the name of the Sur-
veyor—copies of the contracts accompanied by a diagram shewing
the field of labor under each contract—Meanwhile I have requested
a remittance to be made to you of five thousand dollars.

TO COLO. JAMES GADSDEN, Lipona, Florida.
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 30” ulto.” communicating intelligence of the return and favorable
report of Blunt's exploring party.
It would be very gratifying to the Department if the invitation
given you to visit again those Towns, whose Chiefs have been dis-
inclined to remove, should result in successful negotiation.
The Department has no authority to advance four hundred dollars
to Blunt to enable him and his party to make the necessary prepara-
tions for their removal—Three thousand dollars have been already
advanced pursuant to the treaty, and it stipulates that ten thousand
dollars shall be paid, “when they have completed their arrangements
and have commenced the removal of their whole party”.-Desirous
as the Department is of their speedy departure, his request cannot
be granted, altho’ the Department concurs entirely in opinion with
you “that to make the advance would be safe and might be advan-
tageous”. It cannot, however, be difficult for Blunt to obtain credit
for that amount payable out of the ten thousand dollars, to be re-
ceived when his party shall be ready to remove.
If you succeed in your negotiation with the other Chiefs, you will
be pleased to make your payments prospective, there being but little
money available for that purpose, the five hundred thousand dollar
fund having been expended or pledged for other purposes. Payment

Executive Office TALLAHASSEE, Flor: April 27, 1833.
SIR. Governor Duval left this Territory a few days since on a
visit to his family now in Kentucky, and in consequence his duties as
Governor of Florida have devolved upon myself. He will not
probably return till late next fall.
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication
of the 12th instant addressed to him respecting the Appalachicola
Indians.” No copy of the Treaty of last fall,” or any document
relating to it have ever been filed in the Secretary's office, but I
have since the receipt of your letter on yesterday, written to General
Gadsden who concluded the Treaty, and shall probably see him in
a few days and obtain that precise and certain information necessary
for me to have, and which altho’ present at the signing of the
Treaty, and having a general recollection of its terms, I do not
now sufficiently possess.
I do not anticipate any difficulty in getting off by the 1* of Nov:,
all those Indians of the Appalachicola towns, whose chiefs signed the
Treaty last fall, and those not included in the Treaty will ultimately
follow Col: Blunt, and may possibly be induced to go with him now.
The agreement of the Seminoles to remove will I have no doubt
operate strongly upon Mulatto King (Vacapechassa) and Econchati-
Mico—the two principal Appalachicola chiefs who did not agree last
fall and who are yet said to be obstinate.
There are no official or other data in my possession from which
I can at present make as you request “a statement showing the num-
ber of indians that may remain who are entitled to an annuity under
the treaty of Camp Moultrie.” The pay rolls of the Agent now on
file with his accounts at Washington furnish the best information on

measures however to obtain more certain and authentic criteria
which when received I will transmit to you forthwith.
No efforts will be spared by me to carry into effect the views of
the Government as indicated in your communication, and I shall
avail myself as early as I can of the benefit of a consultation with
Gen: Gadsden, in whose ability on this subject I have great confidence.
Without the slightest wish to evade the performance of any duty,
or to avoid responsibility; I would (solely because I consider it the
best course)—respectfully suggest the employment of Gen Gadsden
as a special Agent or commissioner to make every arrangement neces-
sary to get Col: Blunt & party off, under the treaty he concluded—
the advancement to him forthwith of all the funds that may be called
for—the investing him with power to treat with those indians who
have not agreed to remove and with the fullest authority to exercise
his discretion as circumstances may dictate. In such case all as-
sistance that I can render him will be cheerfully and promptly given.
If however it should not be deemed necessary to appoint Col: Gadsden
as I have suggested every duty assigned to me will be fulfilled to the
extent of my ability, and I shall on every opportunity seek his counsel.

point, that I can select for the convenience of the two places and
where I can enjoy good health, which has become highly important
for me, from the severe sickness I have experienced every season that
I have spent at the South.
I propose to carry on the operations of dredging for the straight

I could have replied to it immediately, so far as regarded myself:
I deemed it advisable to postpone an answer untill I could satisfy
you in the other request, “to designate a suitable Individual” to take
charge of the additional improvements contemplated on the Inland
communications between the S" Marys and S" Johns rivers—
It would be gratifying to me, if I could consistently with my
private interests, as well as those of the Government take personal
charge of the work appropriated for; but the work itself is not such as
authorise my devoting my individual attention to it & its distance
from my place of residence (nearly 200 miles) precludes the possibility
of my doing justice to the Government as a Temporary director &
Inspector—My own opinions, repeatedly expressed, are that the
Government should in all cases, if practicable, limit the charge &
superintendence of Governmental or public works to their own En-
gineer Officers; or to competent officers by detail from the other
Corps—I have therefore, after consultation with L' Long, thought
proper to recommend to the notice of your Dep" L' J W Harris,
who is at present stationed in this Territory at Camp King, & who
wishes, on account of his health, to remain employed in Southern
latitudes—He is willing, as I am informed to undertake the Super-
intendence & agreeably to the views I have of the proper manner
of conducting the work—There have been expressed in my estimate:—
That a mud machine, similar to those which have been used in Mobile
Bay & on the S*Marks (one of which is now in operation on the latter
river & will soon be transferred to the Appalachicola river—The
plan therefore which I would suggest to your consideration is that
L' Harris be appointed Superintendent with instructions to confer
with me, & that he should then go on board of the mud machine in
the Appalachicola & there acquire a perfect knowledge of the mode
of applying it; while the Engine, flats &c are constructing for the one
to be used on the Inland passage between the St Johns & S' Marys—
All these preparatory arrangements he could attend to & mature
while he was so qualifying himself as to the proper & most efficient
use of the machine
As I contemplate that he should live with the hands on the machine
personally directing the operations, without the expense of any
other superintendencence; it is suggested to your consideration
whether a compensation, different from the Extra which is usually
allowed Superintending Engineers ought not to be allowed him—He
will in fact be required to act as Engineer & Superintendent all of
which he may do by residing as he ought to do, on the Mud Machine,
& from the fact that the operations will be concentrated—My estimate
was founded on this view of the subject, allowing something like 100
dollars per month to the officer & Superintendent on board and I

think this sum in addition to his pay as Lieut will not be extravigant—
Of course all the advice & directions I may give are gratuitous & only
to aid in the accomplishment of a work which as a Citisen of this
Territory I feel a deep interest in—
From the knowledge I have of the passage to be improved I am
satisfied that the use of a Mud Machine will be most effectual &

SIR In reply to yours of the 13th ultimo” I have to remark,
that it has been my invariable practice to require from each Deputy
Surveyor a penal bond with two good and approved securities, in
double the amount of his contract, for the faithful and timely execu-
tion of his surveys, his field notes have always been acitically examined
and the accuracy of all traverse and fractional work tested by trigo-
nometrical calculations before payment of the account, if subsequent
to this any neglect or deception is detected in the surveys of any
Deputy, his Securities and himself, all are held liable for the cost and

expenses of a resurvey or otherwise—but two instances of this kind
have occured since the establishment of this Office, one Thomas F
White a brother of the Delegate from this Territory, the other Patton
Anderson of Tennessee, in both instances I had the land resurveyed
at the expense of each surveyor and his securities. To defer the
payments of the accounts of Deputy Surveyors until “The accuracy
thereof is tested by actual protraction in the Office of the Surveyor
General” would produce an abandonment of the service generally,
or at least be the cause of serious inconvenience and in some cases of
ruinous consequence to the Deputy, whilst it is believed that the
practice adopted in this Office is equally efficient, and more equitable—
To test the accuracy of surveys by actual protraction in the office
where there are so many private claims and other fractional work
as may be expected in the surveys now executing, will require twelve
or eighteen months after the execution of the contracts before pay-
ment can be made. I trust that no new views or regulations of the
Department may embarrass the surveys already contracted for, and
now in progress of execution.
Any “had surveys in Florida” of which you may be informed, is
not known to me, and I would be glad to be furnished with any infor-
mation in your possession on the subject, to enable me to have it
made good at the expense of the proper parties. My “impressions”
founded on examination and information are entirely of a different
aspect.
The mistake by Clements & Exum on the Escambia River was
natural and almost unavoidable from the tremenduous freshet which
gave rise to it but has been corrected and resurveys made entire at
very great cost to them. I employ no persons but such as I consider
gentlemen of good character and well recommended to perform the
public surveys, but the tange of slander and usual detraction in these
times are too common to be silenced by correct deportment, and to
use an Irish saying “only requires that we” give them rope and they
will hang thouselves” With regard to the work nearly completed
in this Office, I have to remark that the resignation of one, and the
sickness of the other of my Clerks, put a total suspension of business
in my Office for a time, &, shortly after it was resumed, your orders
for the despatch of Deputies again suspended those labours, as the
duties preparatory to their despatch required the services of myself

which documents will show you explicitly, together with ardinary

was not more than would be required, with what was on hand to meet
the demands of the contemplated surveys; and I can assure you that
I never have yet, nor ever shall make application for public funds

I confidently hope that every necessary facility will be afforded to

[Endorsed] Notice to Private Claimants. Eastern District. 8"

Special Instructions to Surveyors
Surveyors Office TALLAHASSEE. 1833.
To. A. B–Deputy Surveyor:—
In surveying private land claims in East Florida, you will have,
perhaps, an arduous and Critical duty to perform, and much must
depend upon the exercise of a sound discretion, as cases or circum-
stances may arise not to be anticipated, and to meet which no special
instructions can be framed. The following essential regulations are
to be rigidly observed in every instance in which you may be called
upon to survey a private claim. to wit:
No claim is to be surveyed unless the same has been confirmed,
and the evidence of which must be the certificate under the hand &
seal of the Keeper of the Public Archives at S*Augustine.
The calls of the original Grant are alone to be your guide in Survey-
ing it. The following quotation from the letter of the Commissioner
Gen' Land Office dated 10" July 1830," and the “animadversions”
therein alluded to, are furnished in order that you may be better
guarded against deceptions which may be attempted to be practised
upon you, and that you may be in possession of all the information
in this Office in relation to the difficulties you may meet with in
surveying the private land claims in East Florida—
“GEN" LAND OFFICE 10th July 1830
“Except to call your attention to the animadversions of the Register
& Receiver in their report on the surveys made by M Clarke, which
correspond with the views of this Office as heretofore communicated

to you, and the surveys of M Clarke cannot be considered as valid
except where they may be established by their intrinsic calls or
where they may stand the teste of blocking out as heretofore sug-
gested to you.”
Extract from the Report of the Register & Receiver of East
Florida—“We did intend to say something upon the subject of the
Spanish Surveys, from which we are now precluded by the want
of time. We will simply remark, upon this subject, that the Surveys
made under the Superintendance of Marrot are entitled to unlimited
respect, and should, in every case, be regarded as conclusive of the
boundaries, with regard to surveys made by private surveyors, or
M. Geo J. F. Clarke, the public surveyor, styling himself the Sur-
veyor General, we entertain a widely different opinion.”
The Report after Commenting on the deviations of M" Clarke
from his instructions, as farther evidence of the illegality of his Acts,
gone on to add, “when the lands were not specially designated, he
would locate wherever the claimants pointed out, provided the place
was vacant, and in cases where the land was specially located by the
Grant, he would, nevertheless, at the request of the grantee, locate
it at any other place
“When M* Clarke was directed to survey by the Grant and when
he tells us that he surveyed without reference thereto, at a place
fifty or an hundred miles off we believe M* Clarke has exceeded his
authority. When the Grant Contains one undivided portion of land,
and M Clarke has surveyed a part of it in one place and a part in
another, whereever a stick of live Oak, or a foot of Hammock could
be found, the survey is not in accordance with ‘the tittle of property
or Grant of the Government. and is therefore void'
“When M* Clarke was directed to survey, to an applicant, four
Miles square of land in a body, and locate a part of it in Alachua, a
part on the S* Mary's and a part on the Indian river more than
One hundred miles asunder, as was his custom, we humbly conceive
M. Clarke has exceeded his authority, In a word, when to an officer
of the Government written and postive instructions are given, pre-
scribing his duties, and regulating the manner in which they should
be performed and when that Officer, before a Competent tribunal
has declared upon Oath, that all of his Official acts were performed
without reference to those instructions, and in direct opposition to
their mandates, we have no hesitation in declaring that every such
act of that Officer is null and void, and unworthy of Consideration.
The he was bound to measure to the claimants the lands at the place
designated in the Grant, and according to the boundaries therein

specified. That he had not authority to subdivide an integral grant,
nor to change the location when once it was made; and yet from the
papers in this Office, and from the express declarations of M Clarke
himself it appears too plainly that it was his constant practice to
do all these.”
At or before the time of reaching the Section of Country assigned
you by the accompanying Diagram, you will give every possible
notoriety to the fact, that those who own private claims in the same,
may attend, and have them surveyed and reported
A frequent recurrence to, and perusal of, Your General and Special
instructions is emphatically enjoined-

SIR. On yesterday Col Blunt the principal chief of the Appala-
chicola indians and who made the treaty with Colonel Gadsden last
fall visited me in compliance with a notice I had previously sent
him. He states to me that him self and all the indians named in
the Treaty will get off by the 20th of July. As I am acquainted with
his arrangements I have no doubt he will be ready by that time. The
transmission of the funds to pay the $10,000 and the commutation
of the annuity &c is therefore necessary, as soon as possible. Great
difficulty and trouble occurs from the manner in which funds are
generally transmitted to this Superintendancy. Drafts on New
Orleans Mobile or Charleston (& especially the latter places) should
never be sent us. We cannot get them cashed in Specie here with-
out paying a discount of 1 & 34 per cent and those for large sums
we cannot sell. Drafts on New York here will generally command
a premium (which the Government would save) in exchange for
current Bk notes of 2 percent and can be cashed for Specie at par at
our Banks. In order to prevent difficulty I would again renew the
suggestion in my letter a few days since to the Secy of War, that
authority from the Department to draw on it for the amount to be
paid to Blunt and his indians be given to Col: Gadsden or myself.
I shall visit Blunts town to morrow to ascertain the precise number
of his indians entitled to the annuity under the treaty of Camp
Moultrie and also of those that remain, their quota for this year
being then to be paid to them, and I will advise the Department
thereof forthwith.

Blunt requests me to write for his son at the public indian school
in Kentucky. It is necessary he should be here before the 20th of
July. As the Seminoles are going off also the seven other indian
boys from Florida could all be sent home at the same time. I have
however requested Col: Gadsden to write to the Department on
this subject.
Col: Blunt delivered me the enclosed letter from M Littlebury
Jones " a highly respectable citizen residing near him & I received
that from M. Pope * the temporary Sub agent (also enclosed) a day
or two since. I have no doubt of the truth of the robbery and it
renders a visit by me to Blunts town more advisable.
I had hoped Col: Gadsden would have been able to have gone
over with me and have concluded a treaty with the remaining chiefs,
but he cannot. I visited him three days since for the purpose of
consultation, and will use such proper efforts as are in my power to
get them to consent to go next fall."

SIR: The Escambia River will not, probably, be low enough to
admit of its examination before July. I have however satisfied
myself as to the nature of the obstacles to the navigation, having
obtained information from persons acquainted with the River.
The obstacles consist of logs and trees lying along the bed of the
River, and of trees hanging over its banks.
It is desirable that the contemplated improvement should be com-
menced as soon as the low stage of water will permit, and the necessary
preparations can be made, I would therefore propose to make an
examination of the River in July, and in the mean time to make
partial arrangements with persons interested in its improvement
and who are desirous to contract for the execution of the same."

I have issued an advertisement calling for proposals to be handed
in by the 30 June; I enclose a copy of it. The contractors would
require at least one month to make the necessary preparations, such
as the building of scows &c and the collecting of laborers, so that they
could not commence operations before the 1* August, but if they can
be commenced by that time, and the season prove favorable, we
should be enabled to apply the appropriation with much advantage.
The averaged cost of the Improvement will not probably exceed
$100 per mile, so that at least 50 or 60 miles may be effected under
the existing appropriation; and the whole extent of the River
eeñapleted improved for a sum not exceeding $15.000.
There is no doubt but that the River may be made navigable for
Keel boats at all Seasons of the Year. The distance following the
meanderings of the River is about 120 miles.
The impvmt of the River will afford many advantages to persons
residing near it; to the town of Pensacola; and to the public works in
the Harbour.
The experience obtained from two month's work will enable me to
make an exact estimate of cost of the whole improvement, and to
submit it to the Department by the 30" September in my annual
Report.
Should the foregoing propositions and remarks meet your approba-
tion, I will proceed without delay to make the necessary preparations
for the commencement of the work."

JUDGE CAMERON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[NA:SD, Misc. Lets.:ALS]
PENSACOLA W. F. May 27th 1833
HON: EDWARD LIVINGSTON Secretary of State
SIR! I deem it my duty to bring to the Notice of Government,
through you, the wants of the District of West Florida in Court-
Houses and Jails, and to urge upon it, the necessity of making some
provision, adequate to the remedy of the evil.
There are six Counties in West Florida, and of Course, six places
where U.S. Courts are held twice a year; and yet, save in the County
of Jackson, there is not a single Court House in the District, nor is
there One Jail. Three of the Counties, to wit, Walton, Washington
and Fayette contain but a small population, the business of the Courts
in them is not great; nor is it likely that, for some years to come, there
will be any important increase. But the Courts of Pensacola, Jackson
and Appalichicola are important, and their business is increasing.
In these three Counties, therefore, it is necessary, that there should be
Court Houses and Jails—more especially, in Pensacola and Appala-
chicola, which are Sea Port Towns, and where the necessity of Con-
fining Criminals will often arise.
Except in the County of Jackson, I hold the Sessions of the Courts
in private houses, which are rented, for that purpose, by the Marshall.
As we have no Jails at all, the Criminal law cannot be enforced, as it
should be.
There was, formerly, a Court House in this City; but a Year or two

since, it was pulled down by the City Authorities, for the avowed
purpose of extending a Street through the Lot, although the Lot is
the property of Government.
Untill suitable buildings can be erected in this City, for a Court
House, there is a building here, belonging to the United States, which
at the expence of two or three hundred dollars, might be fitted up for
a Court room. It the house, formerly used as the store of the Com-
missary: it is now in the Occupation of a Merchant of Pensacola.
Unless Government will erect suitable Court Houses and Jails in
this Territory, I fear we shall never have them, as the Treasury of the
Territory is too poor for such an Undertaking.
If Congress should determine to build a Custom house and Post
Office in this City, as has been suggested, it would not be an important
addition to the Costs of such a building if, under the same roof,
provision was made for the Accomodation of the Court and it's
Officers.
Be pleased to have the enclosed letter delivered according to it's
Address.
Allow me to improve the present Opportunity of tendering to you
an Assurance of the very high esteem and respect with which I have
the honor to be”

SIR: I have just received a Report from Lieut. Long, who informs
me, that in compliance with my orders he has examined the Och-
lockeny River to within a short distance of the Georgia line, with a
view to its improvement. Lt Long found the obstructions in the
River to consist of logs & trees that have fallen in from the Banks,
* In reply the judge was informed, June 25, 1833, that the matter had been
referred to the Comptroller of the Treasury, whose business it was (NA, SD,
Dom. Lets., xxv). See also Judge Reid to White, Jan. 8, 1833 (NA, HF, 22
Cong., 2 sess.), relative to similar conditions in St. Augustine.

& of trees hanging over the channel so as to be in the way of Steam
Boats that otherwise could navigate the River during the season of
high water. These obstructions exist throughout the River as high
up as the Georgia Line. It is deemed practicable to remove them,
& highly important to the rich & fertile country through which it
flows.
From the high stage of water, Lt Long was not enabled to make
other than imperfect estimates of the amount of the obstructions to
be removed. He found the River very crooked, having numerous
sharp points that may easily be cut off. He supposes the expense of
cutting through most of those points would not exceed the expense of
cleaning out the bends around them, and would be of great benefit
to the navigation. He considers that the clearing out the logs and
trees & cutting through these points are all that would be necessary
for the Improvement of the River. He estimates the whole distance
to be improved at 250 miles & at the following expense.
10,000 day's work at $1---------------------------- $10,000
Boats, implements, tools &c.------------------------ 2,000
Contingencies &c---------------------------------- 3,000
$15,000
The experience which Lt Long has gained in similar operations &
the favorable results he has produced, affords assurance of the cor-
rectness of his observations & I have therefore written him, in order
to [save] time, to prepare a Project & Estimate for the application]
of the appropriation for this Year, & to submit it for your approval,
and, in the mean time, to make such preparatory arrangements as
will enable him to commence his work as soon as the low stage of the
water will admit.
Lt Long is making active preparations to continue the works at the
St Mark's & the Appalachicola Rivers.”

THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. STATES,
SIR, Agreeably to your request,” I submitted to the Attorney
General” the question, whether the private land claim of Colin
Mitchell and others, now pending in the Supreme Court of the U.
States, embraced the scite of the town of St. Marks, and if so, whether
he would advise you to proceed in executing the Act of the 2" March
1833, entitled “An Act to establish the town of St. Marks, in Flor-
ida” *—He replied, that he had examined the whole case,” had pre-
pared an argument therein, for the government, that the claim of
Mitchell and others did include the town of St. Marks, and that, if it
had not been for the decision of the Court in the case of the Arredondo
claim, he should entertain no doubt of success in the present case.
But inasmuch as it is expected that the decision of the Court, in this
case, will be made at its next Session, the Attorney General expressed
an opinion, that it would not be advisable to proceed in the execution
of that Act, until final judgment of the Court shall be had in the
case,”
I will only add, that I fully concur in this opinion.
I am &c.

on said river *—My letters for twelve months past have reported to
you the obstinacy and indisposition of the Chiefs of those towns to treat
for removal on any conditions. Having at a very early period com-
municated to them the wishes of the Executive of the U. S. on this
subject, exposed the liberality of the Government to them, and ex-
plained to them their true interests; I had conceived it most advisable
to leave the Chiefs to their own reflections, under a conviction that
at the proper time and when convinced that the other Indians gener-
ally intended to move; they would readily accede to the propositions
I was prepared to make them—A few weeks since I received through
the hands of the Acting Governor a communication, signed by the
principal Chiefs of both the bands, stating their willingness to treat
with me, if I would revisit their towns—I lost no time in riding to the
Sub Agents, nearly equidistant from both Econchatimeco and Mulatto
Kings reserves, and inviting the principal Chiefs to meet me there—I
found, to my disappointment however, that the Chiefs either did
not rightly comprehend the communications which had been made
me with the sanction of their signatures; or were unwilling to yield
to the obligation I considered that document had imposed on them.
I found in the course of a consultation or talk, that a strong prejudice
existed on the minds of Econchatimeco Mulatto King and other Sub
chiefs, against Blunt, and a very great distrust of the Interpreter
Richards—It was on this account they stated, that they had hitherto
declined meeting me by invitations to places where the Chiefs and
the Interpreter was to be present—I mentioned to them that it was
a matter of indifference to me as commissioner who interpreted if
the Indians were satisfied and having ascertained that they would
listen to propositions provided they were communicated through
Interpreters in whom they reposed confidence, I permitted
them to nominate the two whose names are affixed to the Treaties;
** By the treaty signed June 18, 1833 (NA,SD, Indian Treaties, No. 187;
printed, 7 STAT. 427–429, and in Kappler, Indian Affairs, Laws, and Treaties,
II, 398-400), a number of Apalachicola chiefs relinquished the reservation on
the Apalachicola River made to them by the treaty of Sept. 18, 1823 (see ante,
vol. XXII, 747–751), in consideration of a payment of $3,000 and an agreement
by the U.S. to convey a section and half each to the Mulatto King and Tustenuggy
Hajo after the lands were surveyed. For delineation of the tract in question,
see Royce, Ind. Land Cessions, plate 14, cession designation 185. On somewhat
similar terms a group of other chiefs, including Econ-chati-mico, Billy Humpkin,
Kaley Senehah, Elapy Tustenuckey, Vauxey Hajo, Fose-e-mathla, and
Lath-la-fi-cicio, relinquished their reservation on the Chattahoochee
River. Provision was also made for the Apalachicolas to become party
to the treaty with the Seminoles, May 9, 1832 (7 STAT. 368-370), should they
decide to move to Arkansas. The treaty was presented to the Senate on Dec.
24, 1833, and ratified on Apr. 8, 1834 (Senate, Exec. Journal, IV, 338-339, 387).

the one Jim Walker a colored man who resides in Mulatto Kings
Town and has been long used by him as his Interpreter, the other a
half breed, Grandson of Econchatimecos and who was for a short
time employed by Gov. Duval an Interpreter at Tallahassee. In
the course of a long talk I discovered that the above chiefs were as
much indisposed to treat for a removal as ever, that the difficulties
of effecting a negotiation with them had increased by delay—They
have been exposed, ever since the question was first agitated, to so
many disagreeing talks from unauthorised individuals; have been
secretely influenced by so many who hoped in the negotiation to
profit by the terms concluded on, and have listened to so many contra-
dictory tales of the Creeks and Seminoles consenting to and again
refusing to remove that they have become distrustful of that event,
and without that event they could on no conditions be persuaded to
migrate–In addition they have Individually been told that the Creek
had made treaties on more favorable terms, and were now realizing
fortunes by the sale of the land the Government had given them—
To reconcile these conflicting opinions by inducing them to yield
to any distinct proposition for removal was impossible, so long as
there was a doubt in their mind as to the Creeks and Seminoles
removing—To leave them without effecting any thing, was only
exposing the Chiefs Econchatimeco & Mulatto King to the influence
of those Individuals and rumors which had already so distracted
their minds—I deemed it therefore after some reflection and much
consultation with the Indians that the Agreement signed and con-
cluded on, was upon the whole the most advisable arrangement to be
made—It would at once quiet the minds of the Indians and remove
them from the injurious influences to which I have alluded; and it
could not but in time fulfil the objects of Government either by
removing the Indians to where they can be protected, or by the
voluntary relinquishment on their part of the protection guaranteed
to them under the stipulations of previous treaties—I feel assured
however that they will ultimately negotiate under the last stipulation
of their compact, relinquishing their lands and coming in as parties
to the Treaty of Paynes Landing—There can be no difficulty on this
subject for they are a component part of the Seminole Nation: were
parties to the Treaty of Camp Moultrie, and in the additional article
in that Treaty by which reservations were made them on the Ap-
palachicola, the Government reserved the right of ordering them,
within the Seminole limits whenever it thought proper to do so-
The difficulties hitherto thrown in the way of negotiation by Econ-
chatimeco & Mulatto King, were evidently with a view of ascertaining
with certainty, that the Seminoles and Creeks really intended to
migrate, and with the belief that delay would secure to them the

most favorable terms—They now have, should they migrate, the
right of selection between selling the Sections to be laid of for them
and paying their own expenses, or of receiving 3000 dollars and having
their expenses paid—After they have tried the land market and
consulted freely with those who are their best friends, they will find
that the latter proposition is the most favorable—I cannot believe
they will ultimately (should the Seminoles remove) conclude to remain
in the Country and come under the laws of Florida; for they have
too much understanding not to force the evident consequences of
such subjection—They want but time and when convinced of the
removal of the Seminoles we may rest assured they will follow—In
the mean while I have suggested: and the suggestion has been well
received, that each of the Bands send one or two young Cheifs, with
the first migrating party of Seminoles to examine for themselves the
country on which they may be permanently located, if so disposed—
I had deemed it best (the present reservations having been but im-
perfectly located, in consequence of the high waters on the Ap-
palachicola at the time they were marked and from their lines inter-
rupting the regularity of our governmental survey that the lands
awarded them under the new stipulations should conform to those
surveys—The quantity (3) three sections owing to the sinuosities
of the river, will probably be very nearly as much in quantity as is
contained in the whole of the reservations—were there lands brought
into market at this time they would not, at the maximum command
more than 5 dollars the acre, or 9600 dollars for each band, an amount
somewhat within what the Government would have been compelled
to allow under stipulations similar to those concluded with Blunt.
I have now closed my agency with the Indians; and as the service
has been one accompanied neither with profit or pleasure; my only
gratification must depend upon the approbation with which those
services have met by the Executive of the U.S. & yourself as Minister
of the Department to which those services appertain "

JUDGE REID TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
[NA:TD, ST Misc. Lets. Recd.:ALS]
S” Augustine of FLORIDA 17* July 1833
SIR, I beg leave to call your attention to a matter of personal
Concern to myself.
It is known to you, that to the Judges of the Superior Courts of
Florida the Law gave the salary of 1500$ each *—to which was
subsequently added 800$ per annum *— additional compensation for
exercising jurisdiction of Land claims in the Territory. Most of
these claims occurred in the Eastern District; at present, there are
none in West Florida—and but one in Middle Florida—which will
not be subject to litigation, and is only waiting the result of the
decision of the Supreme Court in another cause, pending on the same
principles. In the Southern District there are two or three, and in
the Eastern District, where I reside—nearly one hundred.
Under this state of things, I was surprised to learn, when my last
quarter's salary fell due, that the Comptroller had decided he would
not allow me the additional compensation allowed by Law, because,
the last appropriation Act provides for only two Judges and the
Department could not decide for which two of the four Judges the
Law intended to provide."
I respectfully protested against this decision, and furnished the
Comptroller with proofs of the facts I have already stated—but, by
the last mail—I learn from Judge Anderson that he will adhere to his
decision.*
I am thus obliged to appeal to you—Sir—to do me justice. The
enclosed Letters from the District Attorney * and General Call *
[employed by the Government in these cases] * with the certificate
of the Clerk of the Court *—establish the facts upon which I rely
to shew, that the whole weight of this jurisdiction now devolves upon
me; that I am therefore, entitled to the additional compensation—is
an inference, which, unless I grossly mistake, is not only reasonable,
but irrisistable.

* Act approved Mar. 2, 1833, 4 STAT. 624.

It is true, the Law of the last Session does not designate the
particular Judges to be paid—but some Judges are to be paid—and
it is a maxim of Reason as well as of Common Law—that—what can
be made certain—is certain.

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF INDIAN
KEY
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[July 23, 1833]
To the Honorable the Congress of the United States.
We the undersigned, inhabitants of Indian Key, Florida, Shippers,
Underwriters, Masters of Wessels, and others interested in the com-
mercial and wrecking concerns of the Gulf and Reef of Florida, beg
leave to represent, That the rapid increase of business at and in the
vicinity of this Island renders it exceedingly desirable that Indian
Key should be made a Port of Entry and a Custom House established
here.
In the important points of depth of water, goodness and serenity
of anchorage, and facility of ingress and egress, the Harbour of Indian
Key is not excelled by any in this Southern country. Wessels of the
largest class may be brought with ease and perfect safety into the
waters of this Port.—It is situated nearly equidistant from Cape
Florida and Key West, twenty-seven leagues to windward (eastward)
of the latter Port, and twenty from the Cape. From the main-land
of Florida the distance is less than seven leagues, the intermediate
sea safe and at all times and seasons navigable for vessels of moderate
draught. The alluvial islands, termed Florida Keys, and the southern
extremity of the peninsula of Florida, are coming rapidly into notice—
and extensive establishments are now forming for the cultivation of
Sugar cane, Sea-island Cotton, Tobacco, Indigo and tropical fruits.
And such is the relative position, that the products of all that portion
of the main extending from Cape Sables to Indian River is & must

be brought to the market at Indian Key—and the cultivators of the
soil do and must procure their supplies from the same market.
One Store on this Island sold in the last twelve months merchandise
to the amount of twenty five thousand dollars. One fourth part of
this sum was purchased by residents on the main-land—the remain-
ing three fourths by inhabitants of the Keys, and by vessels who
resort here for supplies. Already seven vessels are owned at this
Port—Including these, the whole number that rendezvous here, is
over twenty.
There have been already built here one good wharf and ware-
house—another extensive ware-house will be erected in the ensuing
Winter.
We have additional reasons for asking—and some that deeply con-
cern may who reside remote from this Island. Much the greatest
part of Court & Customs House business in this District originates
in the disasters that so frequently occur in navigating these seas-
and more than three fourths of these accidents take place in the vicin-
ity of Indian Key. Hence more than three fourths of the business
of the Custom House and Court of the District could be transacted
here advantageously for all parties concerned.
Under the existing state of things, property to a very large amount
and many vessels are lost which were there a Custom House here
would be saved, The reasons are obvious.—So much time is now un-
avoidably consumed in transporting that portion of cargo first saved
from a wrecked vessel to Key West that often the residue of cargo
left on board and the vessel itself is irretrievably lost before the wrecker
can return. Whereas, were this a Port of Entry, the Wrecker
could make several trips between the vessel in distress and the Public
Store in less time than he can make one to Key West. To prevent
as far as possible this waste and distruction of property, the wreckers
have in many instances landed the cargos Saved on this Key, and it
has occasionally happened that both vessel and cargo have been
wholly lost in navigating from Indian Key to the Port of Entry.
We utterly disclaim any intention or wish to abrogate or curtail
the privileges of any place or persons—but we deem it right to say,
that when a Custom House was asked for on this coast, Indian Key
was scarcely known. Had its local advantages and central situation
been as well understood then as they now are, a Port of Entry would
have been established here rather than at any other port or place
on this coast. Nature evedently intended this for the sea-port and
rallying point of business for all that portion of the Main from Indian
River to Cape Sable and for the Keys & Islands to windward of
Bay Honda Harbour,

SIR, I have the honor to inform you, by direction of the Secretary
of War, that the authority, given to Col° Gadsden to carry into effect
the treaty with Blunt's band of October 11" 1832, has been revoked
at his own request,” and the execution of that duty is confided to you.
As a Specific Sum has been appropriated to defray all the expenses
of exploring, removal and Subsistence,” these Indians will make
their own arrangements. When you are satisfied, that they really
intend to emigrate, and they “have completed their preparations,

and commenced the removal of their whole party,” you will pay to
them the Ten thousand dollars, stipulated for the 2" Article of the
treaty, and for which you are hereby authorized to draw.
Col° Gadsden has suggested that the months of Sept October and
November will be the most favorable Season for emigrating, as prior
to that time, there is reason to apprehend disease on the river and
Storms on the Coast; and as the Cholera has appeared this year at
the port, at which the Indians must embark. If your views should
coincide with those of Col° Gadsden, you will advise the Indians to
remain until that time, and avoid the dangers to which they would be
exposed by an earlier removal.—

SIR I herewith enclose my return of Land Suits pending in our
Court at S*Augustine." My return of the cases pending at Jackson-
ville will be forwarded by the Clerk of Duval County, to whom I have
sent it to be certified.”
Our Court here has just closed a most arduous session, three weeks
of which were entirely occupied in the investigation of Land Causes.
Several cases were argued and submitted, and considerable progress
was made in others; no decision however has yet been made. We
took up cases of different classes, so that when a decision does take
place in any one case, it will have a material bearing upon a large class
of cases. This will be the case with one of them particularly, which
embraces the question whether the Certificates of Tomas de Aguilar,
late Secretary of the Spanish Government of this Province, imports
absolute verity, and when attached to Documents purporting to be
copies of grants for land, are to be taken as full proof that an original
once existed, when no such original can now be found, and there is
no proof that it ever did exist, except what is afforded by such certifi-
cate itself. There are more than twenty cases of this class embracing
about half a million of acres of land, and it was agreed by the Counsel
that the testimony taken in this case (much of which goes to prove
the usage and custom of the province in matters of this kind) might
be offered in any other case, subject to all such legal objections as
could be made to it, if originally taken and offered in such other case.
A very full investigation was had, which will save much time and
expence in other cases.
I have the honor to be With great respect Sir Yours &c

tion of the Sea wall at and near Fort Marion”—together with the
intended answer. This request has since been withdrawn in con-
sequence of representations made by me to the inhabitants. I am
therefore prepared to proceed as rapidly as possible with the recon-
struction of the Sea wall.
Under the instructions of the Department that no modifications of
the Fort shall be made, I feel it my duty to state that it is uninhabitable
by troops on account of the confined state of the atmosphere within

* The act approved Mar 2, 1833 (4 STAT. 642), appropriated $20,000 for repair-
ing Ft. Marion and reconstructing the sea wall at St. Augustine. A letter from
Del. White to the Chief Engineer, Nov. 28, 1832, had called attention to the
necessity for an appropriation for the latter object (NA, WD, CE. Lets. Recd.,
W 731). Execution of the act was entrusted on Mar. 13, 1833, to Lt. Stephen
Tuttle (NA, WD, CE. Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 4). See ante, p. 769.

it;—(consequently it has not been inhabited by them for many years);
and that nothing more will be requisite for its repairs than the recover-
ing of the ramparts with a new terrace at an expense not exceeding
two thousand five hundred dollars (it will then only be useful as a
place of deposit for stores), with the exception of the re-building of the
three angles of the outwork fronting on the river as specified in the
drawing and remarks previously transmitted. I have not yet been
able to procure the materials for completing the drawings on a larger
scale than that already transmitted; but shall in all probability be able
to transmit them by the 30" of September with a detailed statement of
the facts relative to the work. Much disappointment exists relative
to my construction of the law making the appropriation but at present
my views seem to have been concurred in by the Mayor and Corpora-
tion of this place, as well as by a Majority of the Citizens.

storage purposes only. On Feb. 1, 1834 (loc. cit., T 2261), he reported on the
reconstruction of the sea wall which had been hindered by bad weather. Numer-

Department not feel itself authorized to make any changes in the lo-

of acting upon the subject. This request is made solely in reference
to the location of the wall, and not to the preparation making for the
materials for the work, or the repairs of the Fort.

for him that appointment. You may rest assured he will make a
valuable and efficient officer. He is an excellent Lawyer, and a young
man of the highest moral character.

HON LEWIS CASS, Secretary of War,
SIR, I have the honor to state to you that in July last past the
account of Major John Phagan, Agent for the Seminole Indians,
Florida, was reported to this Office for examination & allowance.
Of the vouchers exhibited by Major Phagan, twelve were found to
have been so altered as to increase their aggregate amount. Three
hundred ninety seven dollars & fifty cents beyond that expressed in
them orriginally. Major Phagan claimed to have the amount of
these twelve vouchers as increased by the alteration, passed to his
credit. Upon inspecting these vouchers I deemed it proper to insti-
tute an enquiry as to the facts in relation to them, before deciding
upon the propriety of passing them to Major Phagans credit—Major
Phagans account was suspended, and letters written to the persons
who furnished the Supplies, requesting them to state the amount
they received of Major Phagan, refering to the time when, and the
occasion for which the articles were purchased & paid for. I have
received answers from three of the persons written to, to wit, Kerr
& Sturges, Thomas Brown, & Robert May J Kerr & Sturgis are
unable to state the precise sum they received of Major Phagan, but
observe “If the bill is forwarded to them they can tell if correct”.—
Mr Brown states that, on the 3" of October 1832 he supplied the
Indians in charge of Major Jn" Phagan & at his request, with articles
to the amount of $21.87% & that on the 7 of the same month Major
Phagan paid him that Sum. The voucher produced by Major
Phagan for these supplies, was orriginally for $21.87% but when
present by him for allowance, was altered to $26.87%. Mr May in
his answer states that, the Sum received by him of Major Jn” Phagan
for the passage of an Interpreter & Seven Indians was fifty dollars.
The receipt produced by Major Phagan for these passages, agrees as
to the number of persons transported, and orriginally was for fifty
dollars, but as presented by Major Phagan for allowance was altered
to $100–

S*Augustine of FLORIDA Aug 29" 1833.
SIR, Your favor of the 6" inst informs me,” that you have learned,
upon enquiry, “that the decision to which exception is taken, has upon
full consideration, been sanctioned by the President”—and you add—
“thus sustained, whatever might be my own views of the subjects, I
should not feel myself at liberty to interfere.”
I am sorry, Sir, to broach you further upon this subject, but it ap-
pears to me, from your letter, that the President may have decided,
without a view of the Proofs and considerations submitted in my
correspondence with you.
I cannot help entertaining the opinion, that upon considering the
letters of General Call and M. Douglas and the well attested fact, that
the land claims within my jurisdiction are nearly twenty times as many
as the existing number in the other three Districts put together—I
say I cannot avoid thinking, that with a perfect knowledge of the facts
of the case, the President would consider me (whatever might be the
doubt or difficulty in relation to the claims of the other Judges) en-
titled to the additional compensation provided by Law. May I ask,
therefore, as an act of justice, that my letters to you with the docu-
ments accompanying them be submitted at some moment of leisure
to the President. I am very unwilling to claim the attention of the
President, even for a moment, for I am aware of the infinitely more
important public concerns in which he is engaged, but when it is re-
membered that I am suffering some inconveniences from this unex-
pected decision, & that I strongly entertain a conviction that I am
entitled to an appropriation made by a public Law—I trust for these
reasons, I may not be considered pertinacious or intrusive. Having
the greatest veneration for the character of the President and the
highest respect for his opinions—I shall submit cheerfully to his ulti-
mate decision, whatever it may be; and I only add, that I am confident
the other Judges of the Territory, if appealed to, would at once say (as
* NA(OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 11); DuVal was also informed of the removal of
Phagan and the appointment of Thompson and requested to submit information
regarding the former's accounts.

you will perceive Judge Randall has in effect said) that the Judge of
East Florida is clearly, and in preference, entitled to the additional
compensation.
In my last letter” the opinion was expressed, that the appropriation
made by the Act of the last Session,” was intended for the benefit of
Judge Webb & myself—but you will find that Judge Randall thinks
that he and I are the Judges meant by the Statute. I take the liberty
to enclose extracts from the Judges letter to me, that you may be
possessed of all the information which I possess upon this subject.
Upon the subject of Land-Claims, I beg leave to state, for the infor-
mation of the Department, that a chancery Term of five weeks has
just ended, the greater part of which was devoted to the trial of Land
Causes. Our progress in the investigation of these causes has been
remarkably slow, in consequence of the practice which I found pre-
vailing here, of receiving oral testimony and reducing it to writing in
Court. Hereafter, depositions will be taken under Commission and
out of Court, which will enable me to dispose of these claims quite as
speedily as may comport with justice to the United States, and the
claimants. Most of the cases now stand postponed by consent of
Parties to July next—in order to enable the Parties to procure testi-
mony—much of which is expected from abroad and to give an oppor-
tunity to the U.S. law agents to attend.
Before concluding this letter, I have to ask, that the checks upon
Charleston in my favor may be sent to my Agents Mess” J & C.
Lawton of Charleston S. Car". If there be no objection to this, they
will be furnished with authority to make the proper acknowledgement
to the Treasury Department. So remote is this place and so tardy
are the mails in their progress hither, that the funds sent to Charleston
will be available to me some six or eight days earlier than if remitted
directly here.

Judges, in finding your additional salary stopped, while overwhelmed
with the business for which it was designed to be a renumeration,
while there exists an Act of Congress expressly securing it to you,
during the continuance of such business. From the information
received from the Treasury, I presume your additional salary is also
stopped, though I think there is so manifest a difference between
your claim to it and that of any other Judge, as should have made
your case a peculiar one, and entitled you to it even under such a
provision as that in the last appropriation act. Next to your claim
I think should follow mine, as [besides the Forbes case of exceeding
magnitude yet pending and liable to be returned] there exists one
other important claim in my district yet undecided. And I take it
for granted our Districts were the two intended to be provided for—
as I do” not know that any claim remains in either of the other
Districts.”

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the commun-
ications of the Indian Office dated the 9th" and the 17th ultimo,”
directed to Gov: Duval. He is yet absent and the duties thereby
imposed of course fall upon myself.
The first communication [MS. torn] removal of the Apalachicola
Indians. In my last letter to the Dept. on this Subject I stated my
belief that Blunt would be ready to go off by the 20th of July.” The
Sickness on the river and other circumstances have caused a disap-
pointment in that regard. Since then (the second week in August)
I went over to Apalachicola having appointed a meeting at M Pope
the sub agent's house, & sent word to Blunt and his second chief to
attend, in order to ascertain how matters stood &c. He did not at-
tend, but sent some of his chiefs with Davy, who made a variety of
excuses and gave many reasons for not having got ready as they
promised. I conversed with these chiefs fully & wrote to Blunt by
S. Richards the interpreter urging him to get off &c. I have the honor
to enclose you his answer and also a letter from a M. S." Johns a
respectable young man clerk in a store on the river.” Their letters
contain the substance of what the chiefs told me [MS. torn] to
every proper means in my power to get off forthwith, but from all
I can learn I must say now, I [MS. torn] result this fall. No news
has been yet heard from Blunts son in Kentucky. He is very anxious,
especially as report states that there have been several deaths among
the indian youths in the school. He should be sent home as soon as
possible.
I would advise the purchase for him of the boat he requests in his
letter. There is one he says on the river which he has in view. Some-
thing should be done in regard to the robberies committed upon him.
It is not for the Superintendant to decide whether Blunt is or is not
entitled to (as he claims in his letter) remuneration from the Govern-
ment for these robberies. He relies upon the guarrantee in the
Treaty of Camp Moultrie of the peaceable possession of the reserves.
I have no doubt that he lost the money and goods he alledges. Every
possible effort was adopted to bring the perpetrators of this outrage

to punishment and they were apprehended but escaped from the
custody of the officer. I enclose you a Copy of a proclamation I
issued for them.” Rawls one of the robbers after his apprehension
confessed the offence fully. I have a copy of his written examination.
Stafford & Oaks fled to Alabama but the latter was pursued by some
persons from whom he had stolen a horse & shot dead in the woods
[MS. torn] fled to Texas. But $30 or $40 of money & goods were
recovered, nor is there any probability of any more being got. The
instructions of the Dep" as to his claim is respectfully requested.
The communication of the 17th above mentioned relating to Major
Phagan and the public monies occasions me to go to the Seminole
Agency to morrow to pay the annuity &c I have paid the Appalachi-
cola indians some time ago—but the payment of the others has been
delayed for his return. I am informed however the indians want it,
and have therefore considered it best to go down at once, and M*
Sheffield the sub agent here being sick the duty is imposed upon me
personally.
I enclose to the Dep" a letter from Colonel R. H Long of Jackson
Co Florida respecting some negroes in Uenchattimico, Town in the
Appalachicola claimed by Hawkins an Arkansas indian.” M Pope
the sub Agents account of the business disagrees with Col Longs in
some respect. He is now absent on leave for a few weeks in New
Orleans on important private business of his own, and on his return
will make a written report. From the slight examination I have made
I am inclined to think the claim of Hawkins the Arkansas Indian is
just and valid. The sale to Milton I consider a sham to afford facili-
ties for their recovery merely. I would respectfully suggest that the
decision of the matter be directed to be referred (as has heretofore
been the course of the Dep" of War in respect to disputes as to
Slaves claimed by Indians in East Florida) to the summary exami-
nation of the Judge of the District of West Florida.

GEORGE W. LONG TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER
[NA:WD, CE Lets. Recd., L318:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE Sept 1" 1833
SIR I herewith enclose you a Monthly Report of operations of
improving St Marks and Ocklockney Rivers and Apalachicola Harbour
for the months of July & August past. The Report of the first I
have omited till this date on account of the continued employment
of putting in operation the two former works, and considerable
trouble in the latter,-
The improvement of St Marks river has thus far been limited to
deepening the channel at the Natural Bridge, which was found much
more difficult from the nature of the excavation which was found to
be almost entirely through a lime stone bed. This work is now nearly
completed and the force employed will continue on the river above—
The improvement of Apalachicola Harbour has progressed rapidly
beyond my expectations, considering the difficulties experienced in
procuring labour: one set of Negros rebelled, nearly killed the overseer
& deserted and a set of white hands that took their places have now
quit from Sickness. Nearly one fourth of the channel from the
town of Apalachicola to St Georges Sound is now completed, and
the whole will probably be finished sometime January.
The improvements of the Ocklockney River have progressed
satisfactorily;—Nearly one hundred miles of the river has been gone
over with and the logs & bending trees so completely removed as
to leave the channel free at all stages of the Water. With the im-
provements limited by the Department to the clearing out of the
channel without cutting off any of the bends, the amount already
appropriated it is thought will be sufficient to carry it as high as
may be found practicable. It is contemplated to continue the
present force on the river as long as the appropriation will justify"—
With great Respect & Esteem I have the honor to be your Obt Servt

JUDGE CAMERON TO THE SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY
[NA:TD, ST, Lets. from Judges, Marshals, Attys.: ALS]
PENSACOLA W. F. Sep: 9th 1833
HON: W. J. DUANE Secretary of the Treasury U. S.
SIR. About three months since I received a letter from M*Ander-
son, Comptroller, informing me, that as Congress, at the last Session,
had made appropriation for paying the additional salary to but two
of the Judges of Florida, without specifying which two, it had been
determined by the Department to pay it to none.” Viewing this
determination of the Department, as bearing with peculiar severity
upon me, I wrote to M' Anderson, in reply, and requested him, if
necessary, to lay my letter before the head of the Department.”
Having heard nothing further from him on the subject, and as quarter
day is drawing nigh, I will take the liberty of asking your attention
to the matter.
The original salaries of the Judges in West, East and Middle
Florida were each $1500 per An: they were required to hold a Court,
twice a year, at Pensacola, S' Augustine & Tallahassee, each; and
the Legislative Council of the Territory were authorized to require
them to hold one other Court only in their respective Districts.”
When the Southern District was established, the salary of the Judge
was fixed at $2000."
Subsequently, Congress authorized the Legislative Council to
establish other Superior Courts,” which the Judges were called upon
to hold. By another Act of Congress, certain Land Claims were
referred to the Superior Courts for adjudication, and for this Service,
the sum of $800 was added, annually, to the salary of each one of
them.”
By Virtue of the Act of Congress, authorizing the Council to
establish more Courts, they have proceeded from time to time, to do
so, untill in the Western District, they have established Courts to be
held in six Counties twice a year—in the Middle Circuit there are
* Ante, p. 856. 70 Not found.
80 Act approved May 26, 1824, 4 STAT. 45–47.
"Act approved May 23, 1828, 4 STAT. 291–292.
* A reference apparently to the act approved Mar. 3, 1827 (4 STAT. 241),
which authorized the Legislative Council to provide for holding additional terms
of the Superior Courts. -
* Sec. 7 of the act approved May 23, 1828 (4. STAT. 285), provided that the
judges were to receive extra compensation, no amount being stipulated.

F L OR I. D. A. T E R R H TO R Y 881
seven Superior Courts annually—in the Eastern there are also seven,
while the Southern has but one yet. While all the Judges are required
to hold a term of the Appeal Court, of from two to four weeks in
duration, once a year. Hence the duties of the Judges of the West,
Middle, and East Districts have been multiplied more than four
fold since the salaries were fixed—while those of the West (or my
District) have been still more increased. I hold 12 Superior Courts
in the year—no other Judge holds more than 7: I am compelled to
travel more than 2000 miles in a year: no other Judge is compelled to
travel more than 800. I have two important Admiralty Courts in
my District (Pensacola and Appalachicola): no other Judge has
more than one. I am compelled to be from home, for each of my
Circuits, three months at a time: no other Judge is compelled to
be from home, half that time.
The reason, which first governed Congress in making the addition
of $800 to the salaries of the Judges—to wit, the Land Claims—still
exists in the Western District. All the cases of that description are
not yet disposed of: some are still before the Court for adjudication.
If it is within the Competency of the Department to make this
distinction, which the Act of Congress omitted to draw, I wish very
much that it should be done. In the small salary of $2300. the deduc-
tion of $800 is too serious a matter not to be felt without much severity
the whole being so inadequate to the services required of me.
May I take the liberty of asking you to bring this letter to the
knowledge of the President, with the view, that Congress may be
requested to place the Salaries of the Florida Judges upon a footing
of permanency, and proportion them to the services required of
them.*
Hoping to hear from you on this subject I have the honor to be
Your most ob: S*.

casioned, not in consequence of the title being doubtful, but because
the Surveyor General of Florida has not caused it to be surveyed. If
the title be found correct and valid in other respects the contract
should be closed, the deed received, and the money paid. Let the
deed be drawn by the District Attorney, and executed in the manner
he shall direct. Give immediate notice to the proprietors that you

I have thought the best mode of ascertaining the fact, would be an
application to you. I will therefore regard it as a favor, if you will
inform me, whether or not an appropriation has been made for that
object, & if any, what is the Sum?
I will only add, that the Court House is a large & valuable building,
but without repairs it must shortly fall to pieces, & that the Marshal
declines causing them to be made unless he has some assurance that
his account for the expenditure will be allowed at the Treasury

COLONEL JAMES GADSDEN, Wacessa, near Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 5th Ultimo,” in relation to
the repair of the road from Pensacola to Tallahassee and thence to
Saint Augustine. The appropriations hitherto made have been
so intirely inadequate to the objects for which they were intended,
that I am not surprised at the dissappointment and dissatisfaction
expressed by the Citizens of Florida in regard to their application-
Where sums so small were to be expended over so great a distance,
it is scarcely to be wondered at, that those who superintended their
application should have been sometimes mistaken as to the proper
points to be improved. I have always considered the application
of appropriations so small, to so great an extent of road, as an utter
waste of money. Apart from the accommodation which a good
road would afford to the inhabitants of the Country, there are sufficient
military reasons why liberal appropriations should be made, and
the road between the several posts in Florida placed in such a state
as to afford the most rapid communication. From the numerous

small islands in the vicinity of Florida, and the numerous small Bays
along its extensive coast, easy access to it will at all times be afforded
to the enemy which we shall at no distant day have to encounter—I
allude to the population of the West Indies; for the course pursued
by the British Government must have the effect, in a short period, to
place the whole of our West India possessions, as well as those of
Spain, in the hands of the negroes—When that time shall arrive,
cultivation must in a great measure cease, and the white, as well as
the coloured, population, must seek some other mode of subsistence—
Piracy and depradation upon our Southern Coasts seems to me to
be their only alternative, and I think a prudent forecast should
prompt us to prepare, by every means in our power, for such a state
of things.
I shall ask for an appropriation, at the approaching session of
Congress, sufficient to put the military road in a complete state of
repair—Should I obtain it, I propose to avail myself of your offer
to direct the improvement in your immediate neighborhood.

TO JAMES D. WESTCOTT, J" Esq.' Tallahassee, Florida,
SIR, Your letter of the 1" Ult" with its several enclosures has been
received."
There appears to be great reluctance on the part of Blunt and his
adherents to remove according to their Agreement—You will however
not relax your efforts to start them in time to arrive at their Western
home before the cold weather sets in.
Before the receipt of your letter Col° Gadsden was instructed to
purchase a boat for Blunt and to present it to him as a gift from the
Government.
The Department has no authority to repair the injury sustained
by him on account of the robbery you Speak of—Congress alone
can give relief; and that body would be full as likely to listen to his
application after his removal as before. His place of residence
cannot affect the merits of his claim.
In the month of June last the Superintendent of the Choctaw
Academy was instructed to send Blunt's son home," and any other
Indian Boys that might be at School there and belonging to the Towns

object accompanied by a sketch "from Searcys map of Fla showing

many persons in relation to those changes. Gen" Call & Searcy &
Col Gadsden " also several surveyors & others who were suposed to

difficulty of identifying him among the Seminole boys at the Choctaw Academy
(Westcott to the Sec. of War, Nov. 14, 1833, NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Schools).
Herring finally instructed Henderson, Oct. 31, 1833 (loc. cit., Lets. Sent, Bk. 10),
that if the boy could not be identified all of the Florida group should be returned.

appropriations made for the repairs of roads in that Territory, exclusively to the
highest parts of the road, and neglecting altogether, low and swampy parts, does
not wish to censure those who have had the expenditure of the money, as it is
probable, the reason is, that the appropriations have generally been two small, to
repair the whole thoroughly. States that part of the road above cited as in a

obtained. Captain Hills will point out the place to you. Do nothing

PENSACOLA. 14" October 1833
SIR/ Waste and trespass upon the lands of the United States within
this District, has become so great recently, that I deem it necessary
that I should give information consering it, and of asking Your par-
ticular instructions as to the course I should pursue.
I have no doubt that, at this time, no less than forty saw-mills,
some of them large establishments, are furnished with timber from the
pine lands of the Government within this District, and from their
rapid multiplication, it is quite probable, that in the course of another
year that number will be doubled—
I am Sensible, to be sure, that Such things Should not be permitted,
but in as much as the people heretofore, not only in this but other
Districts of the Territory, have been Suffered to commit waste upon
the public domain, with impunity, they now think their right and the
officer who now interfear, would not only bring upon himself their
ill-will, but be charged with doing that which it was not his duty to do.
No Suit or proceeding of any kind has ever been instituted by any
predecessor of mine, in relation to this Subject, nor has there ever been
any Such, as I have been told, in the other portions of the Territory:
Withouy therefore, positive instructions, or the example of others,
Similarly Situated, I am quite at a loss to know what I Should do—

Institution in transacting the public business of the Treasury Depart-

performance of every obligation the Bank may enter into with the
Government will be furnished.”
It cannot be expected, that at such a distance you should know

a Capital of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars a large portion of which

Fort Mitchell, and Columbus, by the Steam Boats daily—with all
parts of the Teritory by the Mail Stages from Pensacola to St. Aug-
ustine, which intersect the Steam Boats with the U. S. Mail for this
place twice a week at Mount Vernon. -

Appalachicola will I think be Safest for the Treasury, and a great
convenience to the Territorial government and its officers & creditors
here. I have no interest in this bank but I do not hesitate strongly
to recommend its selection by the Treasury. Its credit is unquestion-
able and its safety undoubted. Its stockholders and directors are
the most wealthy, Substantial, prudent, and permanent of our citi-

eject the defendant or subject him to damages. I would, therefore,

SIR, Immediately after my arrival at this place your letter of
introduction” made me acquainted with the Register and Receiver
of public moneys, and I proceeded to an examination of the condition
of their Offices. It is with much regret that I am compelled to state
that the Receiver's books and papers are in a very confused situation.
In the Ledger there are neither debits nor credits entered in his
account with the United States Since December 1831; but as no sale
of public land appears to have been made since that period, and as
he admits having received his salary from Washington, and as he
assures me that his account was fully adjusted at the seat of Govern-
ment last Summer, I must presume that you have been satisfied of
the accuracy of his Statements. The last sale which appears upon
the Receiver's books was made 9" November 1831. but it appears
by the books of the Register that a sale was made of 160 acres a few
weeks since but no entry is yet made of it by the Receiver. The
first sale made at this Office was to Reuben Charles of 80 acres at
$1.25/100 per acre; the amount of this sale has never been credited to
the United States on the Ledger altho' the Receiver assures me that
it has been accounted for to the Government, yet he has no voucher
to prove the fact. The circumstances above stated will account for

the absence in this report of any account current or account of moneys
on hand at this Office, but as the salaries payable to the Register and
Receiver exceed six times the amount of sales of the public Lands
at this Office I presume that the Treasury Department will always
hold a sufficient pecuniary check upon the Receiver. The total
amount of sales at this Office since its establishment has been one
thousand five hundred and sixty eight dollars and fifty five Cents,
being in payment for 1255 acres of Land. With a knowledge of
this fact it will not be difficult to adjust the Receivers account since
the Commencement of his official career.
There having been but twelve sales of land I deemed it proper to
examine all of them through all their stages in the Books, papers, &
plats in both Offices. I found six of them on the Journal which did
not correspond with those on the Register of Receipts—the errors
I had corrected. - s
With regard to the Register's Office, as I have stated above that
I examined every entry of Land through all its stages, it is only
necessary to say that I found them all perfectly correct, and the
Books & papers kept in a manner highly creditable to that Officer.
The Receiver's furniture is a pine table worth about $3 & the
Register's a pine table and a book case worth about $10.
Against the general conduct & character of the Register & Receiver
I heard no complaints.

their late Treaty.
Col° Gadsden has represented to the Department, that he was

that the importunity of Blunt prevailed upon him to forego his
objection. In pursuance of the Treaty subsequently made with him
Three thousand dollars have been advanced to that Band, and the
residue of the money due for their land will be paid according to
Stipulation.
You will please to give notice to Blunt and his party, that the
Government will insist upon the faithful performance of their Treaty,
and that no possible consideration can change that determination.
By adverting to that Treaty you will perceive, that if unavoidable
circumstances should prevent their removal by the first of November
next, they would be permitted to remain some time, not exceeding
however another year. If therefore the present season has so far
progressed, that their removal cannot now be effected without serious
inconvenience to them, their departure may be delayed until next
Spring or Summer. In case of their refusal to go, the enforcement of
the Treaty will devolve upon your Excellency.
You will inform Blunt and the other two Chiefs who signed the
Treaty, that the Government will hold them responsible for the
departure of their whole Band, stated to consist of Two hundred and
fifty persons—that they will not be permitted to break their engage-
ment by residing among the other Bands, nor on any account to
remain in Florida.
You will also make Known to the Chiefs of the other Bands, that
they will not be allowed to secrete or protect any persons belonging
to Blunt's Band; but that if they take refuge within their Towns or
territorial limits they must be driven away.
You will also procure the testimony, substandiating the robbery
of Blunts’ property by our own Citizens, and forward it without
delay, that application may be made to Congress for his relief—Care
must be taken to have the amount of the loss or theft correctly stated.
If however Congress should not at the ensuing Session pass an
act for his relief, it will not afford good ground for violating his
Treaty. His residence will not affect the justice of his Claim, and
reparation will be as readily extended to him West of the Mississippi
as in Florida.”—
I have the honor &c.,

The Register's office has been negligently kept as you will believe
when I state that altho' the Register of certificates is made up to
30* September 1833. and the Journal of Entries up to 30" June
1833. yet the Journal has never been added up Since 1* June 1828
The entries in the Ledger of Sales are up to the 30" September
1833.” but no additions have been made Since 30" June 1828 with
a few exceptions and they are noted in pencil marks. The Register's
Son (who is de facto Register) promised me that these omissions
should be promptly supplied and should not occur again. The tract
books have been opened in the numerical order prescribed by the
General Land Office.
I made a comparison between the Tract book & township plat and
having early discovered one error I was induced to occupy much time
in further investigation & I believe with that one exception (which
was promptly corrected) the Tract book & township plat are in ac-
cordance with each other. Two desks worth about $30 is the furni-
ture of the Register's Office & one desk and one iron chest worth
about $110. is the furniture of the Receiver's Office. Against the
character or conduct of the Register or Receiver I heard nothing.

WILLIAM D. PRICE TO ANDREW STEVENSON 44
[NA : TD, ST, Lets. from Collectors: ALS]
[October 1833]
SIR In consiquence of my having in accordance with my oath
reported the mail contracor when failures occured, he abandoned his
contract and expressed a determination to have me removed from
the office of Inspector of the customs or Post Master of Appalachi-
cola.—With such malignant feelings most unjustly indulged he
accordingly reported to the Secretary of the Treasury depmt: that
I held two offices and has failed to inspect for more than a few minutes
a vessel which arived here from Baltimore with an assorted cargo.—
The truth is I boarded the said Vessel three miles from the Port
while she was dischargeing on board the mail steam Boat, and finding
she contained nothing but domestic produce, and there being no
certificates to be taken up nor any other duty to be performed by me.—
I left her, as is costomary under such circumstances. The consiquence
is I am required by M" Duane to resign one of my offices upon an
ex posta and malevolent misripresentation of the circumstances of

covered land offices in Alabama, recommended the abandonment of the office at
St. Augustine, is entered in NA(GLO, Reg. of Lets. Recd.), but has not been
found. The same register contains entries for two undated letters of 1833 sub-
mitting his accounts for examining the land offices. A letter from Hayward to
Biddle, Dec. 19, 1833, asks about the completion of his reports (NA, GLO, Misc.
Lets. Sent, Bk. 4). Reports submitted by Henry Washington, Aug. 4, 1829, on
examinations of land offices in Florida and Alabama have not been found (NA,
GLO, Reg. of Lets. Recd.). Instructions relative to the correction of records,
resulting from Washington's inspection, were communicated by Graham to
George W. Ward at Tallahassee, Sept. 5, 1829 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent,
Bk. 24).

the case. which I believe would not have been done had the Secretary
been correctly informed by a true statement of the real facts apper-
taining to my situation connected also with the circumstances so
universally prevalant all over the country of Post Masters holding
at the same time other offices the duties of which are not incompatible
with that of the principle inforced by the late secretary in my case
would at once disfranchise a very largue proportion of the Post
Masters in the United States. and must be attended with very serious
inconveneance to the Government and the country, since a contrary
costom has always prevailed In this Territory alone there are numer-
ous instances of Post Masters holding at the same time another office.
(to wit) The P. M. at Tallahassee is also a clerk in the Surveyer Genlis
office with a sallary of a $1000."—Also the Surveyor the Port of
St: Marks" and the Inspector at Tampa Bay" are also Post Masters
at those offices others might be mentioned of minor consequence-
My pay as Inspector is only $750 and the emoluments of the Post
Office do not exceed $200 per annum—We have only a weekly mail,
and the time occupied in opening and closing is not more than three
hours. I have also a competent deputy who attends to the P. Office
when I am occupied by my duties as Inspector. In such an unhealthy
and expensive situation as Appalachicola it is very obvious that the
joint emoluments of the two offices is barely sufficiant to support
my family. From 4 to 5 months during the year there prevails a most
malignant fever which carries away a large proportion of the inhavi-
tants and all who are able, abandon the place during the sickly season.
—Under such circumstances I never would have been induced to
accept the offices in question and to continue at all seasons at the
peril of my life to discharge the duties of both nearly for the scanty
support they have heretofore furnished. The consideration was
entirely prospective, and I was willing to endure and have continued
to endure a perrillous probation with the distant prospect of remunera-
tion when the offices should become profictable. It cannot therefore
but be considered as an extream hardship indeed to be compelled to
surrender one of the offices so essential to my support, and without
any inconveniance or neglect resulting either to the Post office or
the Revenue by reasons as above stated-

GEORGE W. LONG TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER
[NA:WD, CE Lets. Recd., L 324:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE Nov 34 1833
SIR I herewith enclose you a Monthly Report of the operations
of improving Apalachicola Harbour St Marks Harbour & river &
Ocklockney River for the Month of October 1833
The channel of the St. Marks River has been opened to the point
at first contemplated, so as to be navigable at the high stages of the
Water. There are many places yet requiring to be deepened for
this navigation to render it free as it was in the first estimate designed,
for which the estimate was made in the Annual Estimate for an
additional appropriation—The work is now suspended: the appro-
priations heretofore made with the exception of a small balance
having been expended–
The work of clearing the Ocklockney River of obstructions has
also been suspended from the expenditure of the appropriation for
that purpose, with the exception of a small balance
The River has been cleared of obstructions so that small Steam
Boats may ply on it at high water for about 150 miles from its mouth.
The accompanying Report exhibits the expenditures for this im-
provement—
The Dredging of the Straight Channel at Apalachicola progresses
prosperously and promises the greatest success, subject however to
the many interruptions by storms & bad weather, and being fre-
quently deserted by the hands employed, who from the high wages
in the town cannot be had at any fair rates on board of the boats.
Without any unusual interruption further it is hoped that the cut
will be effected by Feby, next. The current of the water washes the
channel to 12 & 14 feet in debth as soon as the crust of hard sand is
cut from the bed and gives the water action on the blue clay bed
which lies under it. It is the success of this work that induced me to
recommend the attempt to remove the outer bar at St Marks Harbour
to admit vessels of greater draught than those now in the trade of
the place.
I have the honor to remain Respectfully & with great esteem Your

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF ESCAMBIA
COUNTY
[NA, SF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[November 4, 1833]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress
of the United States—
The Memorial of the undersigned Citizens of the County of Es-
cambia in the Territory of Florida respectfully represents—
That the salary of the Judge of the Western District of Florida is
wholly inadequate for his support, and by no means commensurate
with the services he is required, by Law to perform—that the duties
of the said Judge are much more arduous than those of any other
judge in Florida, and greatly exceed those required of the District
Court Judges in Alabama Louisiana or Mississippi—
Your Memorialists respectfully represent unto your Honorable
Bodies, that at the time of the organization of the Territorial Govern-
ment, and at which time the salary was fixed at $1500, the Judge
was only required to hold Courts twice during the year, at Pensacola
and at one other place in the district to be designated by the Legis-
lative Council *—that subsequent acts of Congress have authorized
the Legislative Council to compel the Judge to hold Courts at such
places and at such times as the said Council shall direct—that a
Court of Appeals has also been authorized by act of Congress" to
be held by all the Judges of Florida at Tallahassee, once a year-
and that in pursuance of said acts of Congress and the powers so
given, the Legislative Council have organized a Court of Appeals to
be held by all the Judges once a year, and Six Superior Courts in the
District of West Florida which the Judge of this district is required
to hold twice a year—
Your Memorialists would further represent that it was ascertained
several years since, when the number of Courts in the Territory, and
more especially in the Western District were not half as numerous

as they now are, that the salary of the Judges were inadequate, and
your Honorable Body in order to supply the deficiency, allowed an
extra Compensation to each of the Judges of $800 annually, for the
adjudication of Land Claims; at the last Session of Congress this
extra allowance was directed to be Continued to two of the Judges
only,” but as the act did not designate which two, the Officers of
the Treasury Department have we understand, declined paying it to
any of them,” and thus, none of them have received it though there
are land claims still existing in all the Districts, as we thélerstand
learn. We know it to be the case in West Florida—
Your memorialists respectfully represent to your Honorable Bodies
the propriety and necessity of placing the salaries of all the Judges
of Florida upon a permanent and liberal footing: they believe that the
salaries of all of them are inadequate, but more especially that of the
Judge of the Western District. He is required to hold terms of Court
in six Counties twice during the year, and to attend the Court of
Appeals at Tallahassee annually. The time required in holding said
Courts and in travelling to and from them, through a new Country
with a sparse population, exceeds six months in the year, while the
distance travelled, annually is upwards of 2000 miles—Disclaiming
any intention or wish to draw an invidious distinction, your memori-
alists think, nevertheless that the justice of increasing the salary of
the Judge of the Western District will be more apparent by a slight
comparison of his duties and services with those of the other Judges
in Florida. While he is required to hold 12 Courts in the year,
besides the Court of Appeals, and to travel more than 2000 miles in
doing so, and be absent from his family more than six months in the
year—the Judge of the Middle District has only about 500 miles to
travel and to hold terms of Court in only four Counties together with
the Court of Appeals—the Judge of the Eastern District has to hold
Court but in four Counties, and the Court of Appeals, and to travel
between 800 & 1000 miles, and the Judge of the Southern District
has to hold Court for one County only, and to travel to and from the
Court of Appeals—The Judge of the Western District has moreover
two places in his district, to wit, Pensacola and Appalachicola where
he will be compelled to hold extra terms for the trial of Admiralty
cases; and more especially at Appalachicola, which is becoming one

of the most commercially important places on the Gulf of Mexico
and in the Course of a few years, will almost rival Mobile. In hold-
ing the said Courts at Appalachicola, the Judge is necessarily subjected
to great risks and heavy expenses, from the difficulty of getting to
Appalachicola, and from its great distance from Pensacola, his neces-
sary place of residence—The other Judges in the Territory have only
one point in each of their districts where Admiralty business can
possibly arise, and those places are in the immediate vicinity of their
respective residences, while the Courts of Pensacola and Appala-
chicola are each important Admiralty Courts—each within the West-
ern District, and distant the one from the other, more than 300
Miles—
Your memorialists would respectfully call the attention of your
Honorable Bodies to the fact of the very extensive jurisdiction and
multifarious duties of the Superior Courts of this Territory, and of
the importance of having the Salaries of the Judges such as would
induce Gentlemen of proper legal qualifications and attainments to
accept and retain the office–To have and to keep such Judges is not
only important to the people, but to the Government. Your memo-
rialists further represent that in addition to the duties imposed upon
the Judges by the several acts of Congress, they are required to
inforce (exclusively) the entire Criminal Code of the Territory—
originally or by appeal the Civil Code, and to keep the Court of
Chancery always open for the purpose of making interlocutory de-
crees, hearing motions &C so that the presence of the Judge is always
indispensable in his district—
Your memorialists would most respectfully suggest that the duties
required of the Judge of the Western District of Florida are much
more arduous than those required of the Judge of the Eastern District
of Louisiana, and that he ought in the humble apprehension of your
memorialists, at least to be entitled to the same Compensation—
Your Memorialists therefore pray your Honorable Bodies to pass
an act directing the Eight hundred Dollars of extra salary for the
year 1833 to be paid to the Judge of the Western District as well as to
all the Judges of Florida and to increase the permanent salary of the
Judge of the Western District to such sum as would be a fair equivalent
for the services required of him—The Amount of Compensation must
of Course be left to the Wisdom of Congress, but we hope to escape
the imputation of presumption, if we suggest $3000 as being nothing

Office of the Solicitor Of the Treasury Nov 7, 1833
SIR, I have received from George Walker Esq U. States Attorney
for West Florida, a letter bearing date the 14" October 1833” which
I have the honour to send enclosed, in which he informs me that
extensive Waste & Trespass have been committed on the pine lands,
belonging to the Government in West Florida, and that forty sawmills
are supplied with timber from these lands. He asks instructions as
to the course he shall take.
Having understood from the Commissioner of the General land
Office, that his experience is, that suits for Trespass on Public lands
are generally fruitless & leave heavy Bills of Costs for the U. States
to pay, I addressed him an unofficial note on the subject,” that
I might by a written answer, have in writing, to be laid before you,
the result of his experience." I sent enclosed Copies of my letter &
his answer. From the latter you will perceive that it is his opinion,
that a civil remedy would be found unavailing; And recommends
that the intruders should be removed by the Marshal. From Opinions
heretofore given by Attorney General of the U. States, there is no
doubt this extraordinary remedy is applicable to trespassers for the
Purpose of waste as well as settlement.
As the proceeding by force to eject the intruders under the Act of
the 3" of March 1807 entitled “An Act to prevent settlements being
made on lands ceded to the U. States, until authorised by law”,”
is entirely under the direct authority of the President of the U. States.
I have the honor to send the above mentioned letters to you & to
submit to your decision, whether you will order the Marshal to
remove the intruders in question, or the District Attorney be directed
to institute suits of ejectment & for damages against them.”

ACTING GOVERNOR WESTCOTT TO THE SECRETARY
OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Schools:ALS*]
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE Nov 13. 1833.
SIR. On yesterday I advised the Department of my return from
the Appalachicola Towns which I had visited with the Agent Genl
Thompson to attend to the execution of the treaty with Blunt and
Davy," and I promised to communicate by this mail the particulars
to the Dept:
Blunt and Davy with Stephen Richards the interpreter visited me
at this place on the 27th of October and had a full conversation with
the agent and myself. They still complained greatly of the last
Treaties concluded by Colonel Gadsden with the Upper Towns.
Blunt and Davy again stated to me that their people were leaving
them and going to the Upper Towns and to the Creek Nation, and
among the Seminoles, and that my instructions to the sub agent
and my orders sent to the other chiefs to send their indians home
were disregarded. They complained that good faith had not been
observed towards them in as much as they were assured when they
made their treaty that all proper efforts should be used to get the
other Towns to go with them. Blunt also complained that he had
not received remuneration for the robberies by the whites of his
property since the treaty.
A memorandum of the conversation will be inclosed to the Dept
by General Thompson by this mail."
"Printed also in S. Doc. 512, 23 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 671–673.

"The memorandum dated Oct. 28, 1833, is in NA (OIA, Lets. Recd.,
Apalachicola).

The last difficulty was as will be seen by the memorandum easily
obviated. I assured him if the Govt: should allow him any thing it
should be sent to him to the nearest U.S. fort or post to his residence.
I refer the Department particularly to this memorandum of your
conversation on this subject as it may be important hereafter.
To remedy the first complaint I appointed the 9th instant to visit
the towns and hold a talk with the indians and see that matters were
all set right and my orders obeyed.
When I got there I found that the Sub Agent had just come home
after an absence of nearly three months in Louisiana. I knew of his
visit but not of his protracted absence and could not account for not
having heard from him.
Gen: Thompson the agent being introduced to the indians in Council
gave them the talk of which a copy will also be inclosed by him to
the Dept.
Their reply will be also inclosed by him at the same time.
To remedy the complaint of Blunt in regard to good faith not having
been observed towards him as aforesaid I consented to address a
letter for Yellow Hair to the President " which is inclosed in another
communication by the same mail with this.
General Thompson by my instructions paid Blunt & Davy $1500
as I advised the Dept by last mail. I am confident our course in this
respect will be approved.
The Creek agent and Colonels Abert & Bright have been written
to respecting our runaways to the Creek nation and furnished with
a list of their names &c Those is in the Seminole Nation have been
ordered up home and those in the Upper Towns been sent out.
Nothing now exists to delay the departure of Blunt and Davy with
the principal portion of their people but the absence at the indian
school in Ky of the boys belonging to their Towns. They will not
stir a step however till the boys arrive, but are prepared to go off
immediately on their arrival
I have written to “Colonel R. M. Johnson or the Supt. of the Indian
school at Great Crossing” “Ky” on that subject a copy of which I
inclose." I beg that the Department will renew the instructions
given on that subject some time since. All the boys from the Appala-
chicola towns should be sent home as speedily as possible. Blunt
and his party are incurring heavy expenses daily and if the return
of the boys is delayed beyond the middle of Jany. I am afraid of
continued delay in the embarkation. While at Appalachicola I pro-

cured a list of the boys now at the school in Ky which is inclosed
annexed to the copy of the letter to Colonel Johnson. I would sug-
gest that the best route home is by Nashville Ten: Huntsville Ala
to Columbus Ga and thence to M* Vernon Fa by Steam Boat when
they are but a few miles from home.
It will be necessary for the Department to decide what amount
will be due Blunt & Davy for the advance of annuity and to transmit
the funds or authority to draw therefor to the Executive of Florida
by the time the boys arrive.
Should Yellow Hairs proposition be acceeded to, funds must also
be transmitted to pay his party at the same time. I respectfully
suggest that the rule I have proposed in a State ment of population
&c forwarded to M.” Herring be adopted for the ascertainment of the
amount of annuity to be paid the emigrants—deducting for those
who remain behind—and that the same proportion also of the $10,000
to be paid to Blunt & Davy be deducted. I have notified him he
would not be paid for those who did not go.
Blunt has requested me (as his friend) to write to New Orleans to
know what rifles can be got for—and he intends to have 100 sent
down to the Baleze for his party with also considerable goods. As
this will not be done till he is about starting Yellow Hairs can be
purchased at the same time if his proposition is agreed to and if the
Executive here is advised so to do by the Department.
I would suggest the authority to the Governor here to appoint an
agent to go along with Blunt and Davy to the mouth of the Sabine
to protect them & their party from the depredations of scoundrel
who may meet them along the coast and rob them or force them to
violence. He can select a trustworthy white man for $250 the trip.
I trust the Dept will be satisfied I have done my duty in this busi-
ness I know I have left nothing undone in my power to perform,
But I am gratified that the arrival of Gov. Duval which is hourly
expected will afford the Government the benefit of his better judgment,
and riper experiences."
I have the honor to be Sir Your Most obt:hble Sert:

boarded.
Please cause Private John Young now in confinement at Fort

HON LEWIS CASS
SIR. As promised in my letter of acceptance addressed to you &
dated I think the 14" of September last,” I set out from my residence
on the 8" of October last, and arrived in Tallahassee on the 17" at
night. Early the succeeding morning I reported myself to the Acting
Govenor of the Territory (the Govenor was then absent) who in-
structed me to remain in Tallahassee a fiew Weeks to aid him in
carrying into effect the Treaty with John Blunt and Davy Elliott
Chiefs of a band of Appalachicola Indians. On the 28" of October
he instructed me to accompany him to Wacca Pachassies Reserve on
the Appalachicola for the purpose of meeting the Indians in Council
on the 9" of November then ensuing, and pay to John Blunt & Davy
Elliott the sum of $3000, to aid in makeing arrangements necessary to
itheir emigration—Preparitory to the contemplated payment he drew
on the War Department in my favour as Agent for the Florida Indians,
for the whole Sum ($10000) Stipulated to be paid to those Chiefs
when they shall commence the removal of their whole band—On
further reflection it was concluded that $2000 would be ample for the
purpose then contemplated. The Central Bank of Florida had agreed
to Cash the Draft I therefore drew that sum from the Bank leaveing
$8000 standing to my credit. Haveing met the Chiefs at the Ap-
pointed time," it was concluded that $1500 instead of $2000 would be
sufficient to prepare the outfit of Blunt and his band, which latter
amount I paid to Blunt & Elliott and took Duplicate receipts one of
which you have enclosed—The remaining $500 I deposited to my
credit in the Bank on my return to Tallahassee makeing an aggregate
deposite in the Bank of $8500–

On the 23" of November Ul" His Excellency Governor Duvall who
had then recently arrived in the Territory instructed me to proceed
to the Agency and take possession of the Office," records papers &c
and return to Tallahassee by the first of January ensuing, for the
purpose of carrying the Treaty with Blunt & Elliott into full & final
effect. Blunt awaits the arrival of his son from the Indian School in
Kentucky, nor will consent to go without him. It is therefore im-
portant that this boy, and indeed the other Indian boys from the
Appalachicola Towns be immediately sent home Blunt at one time
seemed somewhat disposed not to go untill he should receive an allow-
ance of the money of which he was robbed; but on being made to
understand that Congress alone was competent to make the allowance
which if made could be transmitted to him, he appointed Mr HV Snell
of Tallahassee reputed a young Gentleman of moral worth, as his
Attorney to superintend the prosecution of his claim—
I arrived here last evening and found the Agency House untenanted
except by a Single individual—a mechanic by the name of Dunlap –
The Office door was secured by a latch only, the lock being entirely
out of order, on the discovery of which Cap" Graham today ordered
a new lock to be applyed—I have not yet examined the files, and
records of the Office, and consequently cannot say anything more
about their condition untill I overhaul them, a Service I presume
easily performed as they do not appear volluminous—I am informed
that the condition of the Seminole Indians is deplorable. A destruc-
tive drought which prevailed through out the Southern Section of
our Country was fatal to the Crops of these Indians. They are roam-
ing without the limits of their reserve in quest of Game & other Sustai-
nance; and especially in pursuit of Ardent Spirit. Many individuals
(white men) like so many hungry Vultures hovering over the dieing
Skeleton of some fallen Animal, have located little dirty Whiskey
Shops around the Indian borders, who deaf to the cries of humanity
contemning the laws. regardless of the principles of honor & common
honesty, and, guided alone by avarice, sell spirit to the Indians,
swindle them out of their horses, cattle, hoggs, corn & Peltry, and
after thus depriveing them of the last means of subsistence, turn them
a drift with appetites & feelings vitiated & inflamed by intemperance
want & hunger, to prey upon their neighbours There is I am informed,
a rum Distillery established on or near the line in a Section Sparsely
populated by the whites, evidently with the diabolical view of selling
the product to the Indians—I will do all in my power to suppress this
disgracefull trafic; but the peculiar character of the country affords
so many facilities to these unprincipled wretches in their illicit pursuit

as to render it impossible to suppress it effectually without the aid
of enlarged powers—I will in a short time address the commissioner
of the Indian Office, when I will inclose for your approval a project
of law to be submited to the Legislative Council of Florida, which if
passed may have a favourable effect—Should you approve of it, I
will be in Tallahassee opportunely to urge it on the attention of the
Council, as my instructions will carry me about the time of the meeting
of that body, to that place
Much has been said, of the unwillingness of the Indians to abide
the arrangement made by them with the Board of Commissioners,
relative to their removal beyond the Mississippi. I have determined
to avail myself of the opportunity of accompanying Cap" Graham who
in a fiew days will visit some of his command now building a Bridge
across a stream on the road from Camp King to Tampa; for the
purpose of acquiring a more perfect knowledge of the condition and
temper of the Indians, and in further complyance with the instruction
of Gov" Duvall to impress them with the necessity of preparation for
their removal.
It will afford me relief to know the views of the Government as
to the time of the removal of the Indians, as I am desirous to have my
family with me. If it is expected that they or a part of them will
remain beyond the next year, I will move my family to the Agency.
May I cultivate the land appended to or connected with the Agency
House? If I bring my family here, plant a crop and the Indians
emigrate in toto during the ensuing year will I be protected in the
right to complete & gather my crop?
When the Indians do remove I verry much desire the Superintend-
ance of their emigration. And the priviledge to continue in the Office
of Agent for them in their new abode, should the Agency be con-
tinued—If the Office should be discontinued, permit me to hope that
you will be able, and disposed to give me some other employment-
My object is to better my pecuniary condition by provident manage-
ment, and a faithfull discharge of the duties of the trust which is
now or hereafter may be confided to me

remuneration for their previous losses—The documents above alluded

The present provision was an ample one, when the only Court in the

of population, five other Courts have been added, requiring ten times
the labor on the part of the Judge, and imposing on him the additional
task of travelling during the year more than two thousand miles.
So fully aware was the Legislative Council of the Territory of the
severe duty imposed upon the Judge of this District, that in 1832
they passed a resolution praying of Congress to create another District

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY MERCHANTS, TRADERS
AND OTHERS OF APALACHICOLA
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
Apalachicola, FLORIDA dec: 9. 1833.
To the Hon” the Senate and the house of representatives of the United
States of America, in congress assembled
The Memorial of the undersigned, merchants, traders and others,
of the town of Apalachicola," Florida, respectfully represents:
That the commerce of this port has increased, within the last two
years, to an extent requiring a direct communication with Europe.
* Referred to the House Committee on the Territories, Dec. 30, 1833 (House
Journal, 23 Cong., 1 sess., p. 139). See post, p. 953.
* An earlier petition from this place, not found, for the same purpose was
referred on Dec. 30, 1829, to the Committee on Commerce (House Journal, 21
Cong., 1 sess., p. 111). The Legislative Council adopted a resolution on Nov.
11, 1829, requesting the delegate to obtain an appropriation for a lighthouse
and buoys at the entrance to Apalachicola Bay, the cutting of a public road, and
the establishment of a post route (Fla., Terr., Legis. Council, Journal, 1829,
p. 36). A similar resolution was adopted on Jan. 27, 1831 (Fla., Terr., Acts,
1831, p. 94).

That the bar, at the present entrance to the bay," precludes vessels
of that class employed in the European trade, from entering.
That at the east end of the island of S* George, there is a ship
channel, with safe anchorage inside, practicable for vessels of the
desired tonnage.
That vessels cannot, however, safely enter, without the aid of a
light on the island, and buoys to mark the channel.
That independently of the commercial facilities which would arise
from these works, they must prove important in a national point of
view, opening a safe harbour for public vessels. Your Memorialists,
therefore, respectfully and earnestly Solicit an appropriation of
money for their accomplishment.

White, Dec. 12, 1834, states that cotton ready for export to Liverpool required
ships of a larger class than could cross the bar at the West Pass. He enclosed a
letter from Maj. William G. McNeill, U. S. Army, who had made a survey of the
East Pass, giving the opinion that if the primary object was to guide vessels
entering the East Pass and at the same time to aid vessels passing in either
direction coastwise, the west end of Dog Island or the east point of St. George
Island were better sites than South Cape which was too distant (NA, HF, 23

DEPARTMENT OF WAR. Office Indian Affairs, December 13. 1833.
To HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida,
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 29" ult° respecting the return of the Seminole boys now at the
Choctaw Academy in Kentucky."
You will have perceived by one of my letters to M'. Westcott,” that
it was believed that two of those boys were sons of Chiefs, that one of
them died with cholera during the last Summer, and that the other
had been brought to this place by Col" R. M. Johnson, and would be
sent home by the first good opportunity. That Blunt's Son could not
be identified at the Academy and that it was feared he was among the
victims of last Summer's epidemic.
I have examined the boy brought on by Col" R. M. Johnson and
found him to be one of the sons of Mulatto King. He stated to me,
that his brother Orsler died with cholera last Summer, and that an-
other of the Seminole boys also died, who was an orphan named
Aaron—That all the other Seminole boys are living, and that among
them is Billy the son of Blunt. This boy, who says his name is Jack
Vacca, and older than his brother Orsler, has been sent off by the Stage

this morning and will probably arrive at your house in about a fort
night.
After examining him and getting his report of the boys at the
Academy, if Blunt and the parents of any of the other boys wish
to have them returned home, you will, after learning such fact from
them, employ some suitable person to go to Kentucky for the purpose
of conducting them home. You will determine the best route and
mode of their return, studying economy as well as the comfort of the
children—You will attend to this business without delay, and draw
upon the Department for the necessary expenses—It is to be hoped,
that as the boys are rapidly improving in their studies none will be
recalled except Blunt's son, and the boy called Sampson from Davy's
Town. It would seem to be doing great injury to the children to have
them sent back with a half finished education. You will however
consult the wishes of the parents, and leave Blunt and the others,
who have agreed to emigrate, no pretext for further delay. In case
all or a part of them should be recalled, you will use your best exertions
to have their places supplied by other boys of the nation. As a fund
has been appropriated for such an excellent purpose, it is altogether
desirable that they should avail themselves of the benefits to be
derived from it.
I will soon address you on other topics embraced in the late letter
Of Mr Westcott.”—
Very respectfully &c.,
ELBERT HERRING.

Key West FLORIDA 15 Dec 1833
SIR, I have done myself the honor of reporting my arrival in
command here on the 26 of Nov: & I have the honor to recommend
that this post be abandoned.
This is an Island, about six miles in length, and from one to one &
a half in breadth, containing a population not exceeding three hundred,
every person included; amongst whom, there are not more than
thirty men of business: there is neither commerce, nor wealth of
sufficient consequence to warrant the very heavy expence attending
the location of a garrison here: All are concerned in wrecking, and
for the lawless character of the wreckers, I beg leave to refer you
to the Merchants, and shippers, at New York, and other ports.
Perhaps you may think it is necessary to guard the custom house
* See post, p. 945.

here, but the little duties which are paid, are in bills on Charleston
and other large cities, and I doubt if the customhouse recipts pay the
actual expences of the establishment.
This place is important only as a marine station, as such it should
be occupied, if occupied at all, and fortified.
I think the government have been greatly deceived or they would
never have established a port here, A Mr Symington who is, or pre-
tends to be, one of the proprietors of the island, and who is a resident
in the vicinity of Washington, has made himself I understand pecul-
iarly officious in relation to the establishment of this post. You will
find his name together with that of the “collector of the customs”
who is another proprietor, on the deed for the land, for the Barracks,
doubtless these persons would be glad to sell all their lots here at the
same rate and retire to the north.
The climate is such, that possesions immediately become tainted,
and should I be under the necessity of buying to-morrow, the merchants
would raise their prices at least four times, which is another reason
why they should wish a military station here.
I now come to the public buildings. I understand that thirty one
thousand dollars, have already been expended, if so, the government
never had its money more miserably and erroneously squandered, or
expended,
The first thing that presents itself in coming to the cantonment,
from the village, is the men's sinks the next, the mule's yard, then
four wretched buildings 20 feet by 30—the first being intended for a
blacksmith's shop which may answer the purpose, the next for a
commissary store, the third, for a hospital, which is in every manner
and way defective, being too small & having no piazza, the sun shines
completely through it, an officer who has any regard for his men, will
never suffer them to be put there, the fourth is the guard house,
prison, magazine, the beauty of this combination is, that if any prisoner
is evilly disposed by being either drunk or crazy, he can destroy not
only himself, but the whole cantonment, now comes a large fram
building intended as officers quarters, with only a roof, & cornices,
if the money which has been expended for the latter, had been em-
ployed in weatherboarding it, the frame might have escaped rotting
from the effects of the weather.
There is another building which was occupied by the officer who
established this post as his quarters, and I understand that it is
intended in the plan for an hospital, it is built over the water, and the
waves beating constantly against the floor, keep it wet, In this climate
when diseases are violent, the remidies are equally powerful, and I
should think a damp floor would be a fine place, for a sick man to die.

on. In fact the house is so damp, that I have decline occupying it, as
my own quarters,
There is besides the buildings above enumerated a one story
errection, which was intended for a kitchen & mess room for the men,
It is now occupied as quarters but is entirely unfit for such, being
exposed to the sun, without piazza &c, There is another small building,
which was built for the married men, in which the Surgeon & myself
are now quarter, It has no piazza and the same difficult as the others,
You have in the above a true history of all the buildings here for
the army,
As there is no fresh water, except the rain, which gives but a
partial supply, you have now, and will be obliged to keep a transport
here as long as you have troops, fo the purpose of fetching water,
and the Quartermaster General will inform you that the expense
of this vessel is equal to that of a Company of Infy.
I have written this letter in great haste for this mail, as it leaves
but once a month, in order that these facts may be promptly known to
you, which I trust will be an apology for the style & manner in which
this letter is written
Should representations of a reverse character to what I have above
written have been made to you, perhaps you may see proper to order
an Inspector General here to test the realities

sions and waste committed on the public lands in East Florida to be
laid before the President of the United States” ” reached me a few
days since on the circuit & I immediately instituted an inquiry on
the subject, which resulted in the satisfactory information that few
or no trespasses have lately been or are now being committed on the
public lands in this District; for some time past, but little live Oak
Timber has been cut in East Florida, and that which has been exported
has it is believed been cut on lands which are held under Spanish
Grants, there is in East Florida much Live Oak timber fit for Ships
of the largest class, on hammocks situated near to navigable waters
and more which by improvements in the facilities of transportation
may & no doubt will ere long become valuable to the Goverment,
There are also some valuable hammocks of Red Cedar these it would
seem to me ought to be reserved from sale & placed under the care of
some officer of the Government, hitherto for lack of Saw Mills in
the District there has been little temptation to commit trespasses on
the public lands by cutting pine timber for exportation. While this
Province was under the Spanish Goverment all actual bona fide
setlers were at liberty to cut timber upon the public lands for their
own private use (but not for purposes of speculation or for exporta-
tion) & it is believed that the practice still prevails, although no
particular instances have been pointed out to me and no complaints
have been made to me on the subject by the agents whose especial
duty it was to attend to the preservation of the public timber, nor
have I reason to suppose that the evil of it be one is of any great
magnitude, such as it is, however I have no doubt that the ordinary
process of law will be sufficient to arrest it, whenever the Goverment
shall consider it necessary to institute proceedings for that purpose,
it will be found I presume that most of the persons who have located
themselves on public lands in this District, have done so with the
intention to purchase the land at the sales, & that if they fail in
doing so, they will leave them on their being purchased by others.
I have the honor to be Sir with great respect Your obt Servt.

[NA:TD, ST Lets. from GLO to ST:LS]
GENERAL LAND OFFICE 24* December 1833.
SIR By the Act of Congress approved on the 28" of June 1832
(Laws U.S. 1 Sess" 22" Cong. p 133) the President of the United
States is authorized to cause certain lots in the Cities of S*Augustine
and Pensacola, to be selected for public purposes, and it is made “the
duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to cause to be surveyed all the
public and private lots and Commons in and about said Cities”"
As no selection could be made by the President until those Cities
were surveyed, the Secretary of the Treasury on the 24" of Novem-
ber 1832,” requested that instructions might be given to the Surveyor
General at Tallahassee for their Survey, which request was complied
with on the 28" of the same month.” In these instructions no
mention was made of the Compensation to be allowed for executing
the work, and the Surveyor General in a letter of the 3" Ins"' in

reference to the Survey of S" Augustine, having expressed a desire
to be informed “what probable amount per lot should be given as
compensation for this troublesome and difficult service” the subject is
now submitted for your consideration.
That the Survey will be attended with many difficulties is extremely
probable, and that no competent Deputy would undertake it for the
usual Mileage is apparent, but inasmuch as the precise extent and
nature of those difficulties, or the time that may be required to make
the Survey cannot be known to this Office, I am not prepared, at
this time, to recommend any specifid allowance, but would respectfully
suggest the propriety of directing the Surveyor General to proceed
in having the work performed, with the understanding that the
compensation will be a reasonable one, and that it will be fixed by
the Department after the delays and difficulties incident thereto
are fully known.”

TO GENERAL CHARLES GRATIOT Chief Engineer U. S.
SIR: I have the honor to enclose herewith Two accounts current
and one Voucher relating to disbursements on account of the Improve-
ment of the Escambia River for the 4* Quarter 1833.
Although the Contractors have not completed the Improvement
of Section No 1. it was deemed advisable to pay them a part of the
amount of the work actualy performed on that Section. The amount
paid is considerably below the value of the work performed.
The rise of the waters will probably compel the contractors to
suspend their operations until the next Summer, with the exception
of that portion of them which relate to the clearing of the Banks
from trees and other obstacles.
Lieut Bowman was sent to inspect the River previously to the
payment being made to Contractors and I now enclose his Report
for your information. I would observe that the Contractors were
much delayed in the commencement of their operations by reason
of the difficulty of obtaining laborers.
* The Secretary of the Treasury directed Hayward, Dec. 27, 1833, to instruct
Butler to proceed with the surveys with the understanding that due compensa-
tion would be allowed (NA, TD, ST, Pub. Lands Letter Book, 1).

SIR. In compliance with the request of the contractors for the im-
provement of the Escambia River, I have examined Section No. 1–
which was represented ready for inspection—owing to a rise in the
river, the contractors have not been able to finish to the required
depth—nor will they, in all probability complete it, until the low
water next Summer.
In the mean time, the navigation of that portion which whieh I have
inspected, is perfect; the only obstructions being logs on the bottom,
which are now four feet below the surface of the water.—
To enable the contractors to meet engagements with their labourers,
without which, their operations must stop, I deemed it advisable to
advance a portion, of the amt due for work done on Section No. 1–
retaining in my hands, sufficient to complete the improvements,
should they abandon their contract. They are still progressing with
their operations, removing projecting trees, and such logs as come
within the prescribed distance of the surface at the present stage,
which is about two feet above lowest water— It is their intention to
pass again over the whole river, and to remove such logs as the present
high water will not permit them to attempt.
I have the honor to be very Respectfully Your Obt. Servt.

SIR, Your letter of the 3" inst.” with the accompanying papers was

the Towns of St. Augustine & Pensacola before the Secretary of the
Treasury, and he has directed me to instruct you “to proceed in the
surveys directed by the Act of 28* June 1832, with the understanding
that a compensation proportioned to the labors and difficulties of the
work, will be allowed when it is completed.” This allowance will be
fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and to enable him to do it,
you will, on the completion of the survey, furnish me with a detailed
statement of the extent and nature of the work, the time it occupied,
and the difficulties incident thereto, with such remarks as may be
necessary to a full understanding of the case.
It would perhaps, be advisable for the Deputies employed in this
work, to have some communication with the Corporate authorities
of the City upon the subject, in order that there may be a perfect
understanding with them as to the principles by which the survey is
to be governed, and to avoid, as far as practicable, all needless inter-

Congress for the making & repairing the road from Jacksonville to
New Smyrna Mosquito C° via S*Augustine has been expended and
the road as far as the balance extended put in good order.” The
repairs however were comprised within twenty miles of S*Augustine
North & South. We profess to know nothing of the present state
of the road from the point North of S*Augustine to which the repairs
reached—but from Pellicers bridge twenty miles south, the road is
in a most wretched state; the bridges are all decayed & the most
of them entirely destroyed. The bridges on the road south of the
Tomoka river have never been entirely completed and within a fort-
night past the bridge over Spruce Creek, about 40 yards wide, has
been burned down by the Indians.
We beg leave therefore respectfully to request you to procure an
appropriation to make thorough repairs of the road & bridges South
of S" Augustine to New Smyrna, and while on this subject, would
suggest, as the mail rout has been extended to the latter place, that
the appropriation should embrace a sufficient amount to build a
bridge over the Tomoka River. The amount required to effect the
objects in a substantial manner will be about three thousand five
hundred dollars, to four thousand dollars.
We have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your most obsts

route named in the request;—there are two routes for a Road; and
these again may be opened in part, each, by two different routes,
VIZ:-
First. From Pensacola to the Head of Pensacola Bay;—thence to
Blackwater Bay crossing at the most suitable place for a ferry at, or
near to, the Head of the Bay;-thence to the ferry at the Yellow
Water River settlement;—thence to East River; –thence to Nichol’s
ferry, (or other suitable place of crossing the river in that vicinity,)
on the Choctawhatchie River;—and thence to Chipola at the point
on it most for the convenience of the inhabitants; which I presume
would be Webbville.—This route would be about 190 miles in dis-
tance; would pass chiefly through Pine Barrens; would be but little
obstructed by Creeks, Swamps, or low grounds; and would have the
advantage of passing through a section of country having considerable
settlements, and in which some sections is already partially opened
and used by the inhabitants. The expense of opening a good country
road made in the usual manner and permanent, may be estimated
at $11400.—
This Road may be made, after crossing East River, to intersect the
one leading from Deer point to Marianna, at Alaqua Court House.
The advantage of an upper road accommodating the inhabitants in
that section would however be lost, and moreover the distance in-
creased. The country on this route would be similar in character
& soil to the other; the entire distance about 215 miles; and the
expense of opening it to the point of intersection at Alaqua—being
about 125 miles;—may be estimated at $7500.—
Second.—Same route to Blackwater Bay;-thence to Yellow Water
River, crossing it below the junction of East River; thence to Nichol's,
or other ferry, on the Choctawhatchie River, as above;—and thence
to the Chipola Settlements, as above.—The country on this route
would be similar in character & soil to the first described;—the
distance the same of about 190 miles; and the expense of opening it
may be estimated at the same amount of $11400.—
This road in like manner after crossing the Yellow Water River
may be made to intersect the Road from Deer Point to Mariana at
Alaqua Court House; the face of the country the same as before
described;—the entire distance about 200 miles; and the expense of
opening it to the point of intersection at Alaqua, being the same
distance of about 125 miles; may be estimated at $7,500.
Having been called upon for this Report & estimates it may not
be irrelevant for me to offer my opinion, that of the foregoing Routes,
the first described, (crossing the Choctawhatchie at Nichol's or other
ferry) would give the most accommodation to the Public generally.

While describing these Routes for a Road I will also mention one
somewhat different to either of the others, that may be taken, viz:—
From Pensacola to Cotton's Ferry on the Conecuh River; thence by
the nearest practicable route across the Creeks which fall into Black-
water Bay to the ferry at the settlements on Yellow Water River; and
thence by either of the Routes first described to the Chipola Settle-
ments. Neither the face of the country on this Route, nor the dis-
tance, would vary materially from the others; excepting that the
Conecuh Swamp would require extensive Bridges & Causeways,
and there would be more Bridging of Creeks; to meet which additional
expense of $5000.—must be added to either of the foregoing Estimates.
Although I have not a particular & minute knowledge of all the
parts of the Routes, before described; yet the country generally, &
by far the greater portion of all the identical Routes described, are
familiarly known to me; and I am therefore enabled to state, with a
degree of confidence, that the foregoing report contains a sufficiently
accurate estimate both of distances, & estimated expense of opening
the Roads, to form the Basis of an appropriation, for whichever may
be selected as the most eligible.

INDIAN KEY, Flor. Jan. 6, 1834.
SIR. Some time since I addressed to your care a petition to Con-
gress for having this port made a Port of Entry & a Custom House
established here." Expecting that an Agent would have been sent
from this place who would be able to answer all inquiries in relation
to the matters named in the petition, I did not enter into minute
details. As I yet hope that an Agent will be in attendance at Wash-
ington, I deem the following items all that are necessary, at least for
the present.
The whole number of Wrecking Vessels now on the Florida Reef is
fourteen. Of this number one only cruises to leward (westward) of
Bay Honda Harbour The remaining thirteen cruise to windward
(eastward) of Bayo Honda, & all of these vessels rendezvous at
Indian Key. Eight of them are owned here—(One vessel, a fine
schooner of sixty tons, has been added since the date of our petition.)
Of the whole number employed, only one is owned at Key West.

By reason of the absence of the Inspector during a part of the

that quarter. We may fairly presume that the arrivals & departures
for the 1st. Q'r. will average with the 2nd. & 4th. This will give

double what they now are; & more than three-fourths, probably
seven-eighths of the Custom House & Court business now done in
the District would to the great convenience & advantage of all parties
be transacted here."

ET AL. OF THE TERRITORY
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS”]
[January 10, 1834]
To the Honourable the members of the Senate and House of Representa-
tives in Congress assembled—
We your humble petitioners, Mariners, Merchants, and others, for
the for the benefit and safety of our lives, and property—and for ad-
vantage to Commerce–Humbly beg leave to to represent to your
Honourable body,–that the Light House situated on Cumberland
Island at the North side of the entrance into St Marys River, (“which
was placed prior to the possession of the Florida's”) is of little or no
benefit to the Mariner—as it cannot be seen in entering that Bar—
neither when bound from the South, untill several miles to the north-
ward of it—and your honourable body will therefore observe, the
utter inutility of that Light, as a guide to the mariner—
And we your Humble petitioners do humbly pray, that your Hon-
ourable body, for the advantage of Commerce; safety of lives, and
security of property, will in their wisdom, take into consideration the
difficulties and dangers of such navigation, and make an appropria-
tion, for a Light House to be built on Amelia Island, (“forming the
South side of that entrance”) in place of the one now on Cumberland
Island—which Light would be seen to a greater distance in all direc-
tions seaward, and give every advantage to the Mariner that they are
intended, and facilitate the commerce of this section—And we like-
wise beg leave to represent to your Honourable Body that the officers
appointed by government, that did survey this Coast—together with
the officers of government vessels who have visited this Harbour, have,
and do still concur, with your petitioners in the uselessness of the
present Light on Cumberland Island, and the benefit to be derived
from one if established on Amelia Island”—
Therefore we your Humble petitioners—confiding in the wisdom
and justice of your Honourable body, do humbly pray that our
prayer may be granted—

ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE Jany 15th 1834
SIR, I am informed by my predecessor in Office, and by the Counsel
specially employed on the part of the Government, that several cases
are now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States,
between individuals claiming lands in Florida and Missouri, and the
United States, and that the decision of some of these cases which
have been argued, and the argument of those not yet actually heard,
have from time to time, been deferred by the Court, for the purpose
of enabling the Government to obtain from the Spanish authorities,
certain archives relating to land titles in Florida and Louisiana which
it was supposed were material to the proper disposition of the claims
in question.—By a communication received by Mr. Taney from the
State department, under date of the 12th of February 1833,” it
appears that a dispatch was received at that department, from our
Minister in Spain, on the 23d of April 1832, covering a royal order to
the Governor of the Havana for the delivery of the archives referred
to; that a special agent had been sent to the Havana with instructions
to urge a compliance with that order; that the agent had not, in
January 1833, obtained a final answer to his application; but that
there was every reason to believe, that the papers would be received
at the State Department, before the then next term of the Supreme
Court.—Upon the statements contained in this communication, the
Court postponed, until the present term, the decision and argument

of the cases referred to.—Under these circumstances, I beg leave to

been received at the State Department, or by its Agent at Havana;
and if not, whether there is good reason to believe, that any docu-

RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR THE
REPAIR OF FORT MARION AND THE EXTENSION OF
THE SEA WALL
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:C]
|January 22, 1834]
Whereas the repair and preservation of Fort St Marks, valuable as
that work must ever be to the defence of East Florida in the event
of war—and interesting as a speciman of military fortification, in its
style and architecture more perfect than any other in the United
States—should, as it has been, be deemed of national importance—
And
Whereas also, the reconstruction and extension of the Sea Wall in
front of the City of St Augustine from Fort St: Marks to, St: Francis
Barracks, are indispensable to the safety and protection of the City
from severe Storms to which it is sometimes exposed, and from the
constant inroads of the Sea"—
And Whereas the appropriation already made by Congress to
effect these objects, will prove, it is believed, in sufficient for the
purpose—
Therefore be it resolved, by this Legislative Council, That our dele-
gate in Congress be requested to use his best exertions to obtain
additional and sufficient appropriations for the entire accomplish-
ment of the above works—
Resolved further that the foregoing Preamble and these Resolutions
together with the special message of the Governor of this Territory,
relating to the same subjects be duly certified by the President and
Clerk of this House and forwarded to the said Delegate—

Gentleman named Henderson *—brought the five remaing boys from
Kentucky and he will have charge of those who are going there—I
have made no contract with him supposing this was done before I left
Kentucky—and as he must be paid for returning it will save expence
to place the boys under his charge—Three of the boys who were at
the Academy will return, Their parents consented and the little
fellows are much delighted—Blount and Davy the Chiefs who are
to leave the United States, now profess to be willing to go as soon as
they receive that portion of the annuity due to them under the 4"
Article of the treaty of 1832,” This should be remitted immediately
and the amount due to these chiefs you will see stated, in the General
statement respecting Indian Towns on the Appalachicola river taken
from the pay rolls of 1833 by M Wescott and by him transmitted
some time since to the Department According to M'. Wescotts esti-
mate, if Yellow Hairs party is included the amount should be $470
per annum for the remaing years under the Treaty of Camp Moul-
trie—If Yellow Hairs party is excluded then, Blount and Davy will
be intitled to $390 per annum, It is all important that the Executive
shall receive an early answer to the letters transmitted by Mr Wescott
on this subject made at the time of the transmission of the statement
above refered to—The Department should also decide as to the man-
ner of paying the amount, and all money to be disbursed here, should
be in checks on some Bank in New Orleans, as I must decline the
responsibility of drawing for funds & coincide with Mr. Wescott in

SIR, In reply to your Note of the 14" instant,” I have the honor
to inform you that none of the papers concerning which you make
enquiry, have been received at this Department; nor is it in my
power to say that any of them will be, during the present term of
the Supreme Court. It was mentioned by Mr. Livingston, the late
Secretary of State in his Note to which you allude, addressed on the
12th February 1833, to Mr. Taney then Attorney General,” that,
according to the last letters received at the Department, from the
Consul and Agent of the U. States at Havana, application had been
made for the delivery of the Archives, agreeably to the royal order,
obtained for that purpose, but that the Captain General was deferring
his decision until he should receive the report of Mr. Callava, former
Governor of Florida. I now state that the Captain General, on the
8th March, communicated to the Consul his intention of carrying the
royal order into effect, and informed him that directions had been

given accordingly at the Intendancy. Within less than a week from
that time, the examination of the documents was commenced by the
agent of the U. States, in company with the Spanish officers, whose
duty it was to attend; and has been continued to the date of his last
letters, with such necessary interruptions and delays as have arisen
from the procrastinating and evasive disposition of the Colonial
Authorities, the conflicting official duties of the Commissioners whose
presence was required at the examination; the frequent holidays,
during which the public offices are closed; the repeated illness of the
Agent, and the dreadful prevalence of the cholera in the city, which,
for a time, nearly put a stop to all business. Mr. Shaler, the American
Consul, and Commissioner for the recovery of these archives died of
the epidemic on the 28th of March subsequently to which the powers
wherewith he had been vested were committed to Mr. Robinson,
the Special Agent and Mr. Cleveland, the American Vice Consul.—
The principal duty has been performed by Mr. Robinson, who was
represented by Mr. Shaler, in his letter to the Department, of the
10th February last, as “an intelligent, indefatigable and anxious
public Agent,” and whose plan of investigation is spoken of in the
highest terms by Judge Webb of Florida, after personal observation.
Some idea of the arduous task he has had to perform may be gathered
from the following Extract of a letter written by him to the Depart-
ment on the 4th of May last,” and which relates to one only of several
places, in which the Archives sought for, have been deposited.—
“On opening the first apartment, by the side of a stairway, fourteen
large boxes full of papers, reputed to be the old Archives of the Floridas
and Louisiana, were exhibited—Near them the contents of four other
boxes of similar documents were promiscuously piled together.—
Passing up stairs, I was ushered into a room of twenty five by seventy
feet, with forty seven cases, or presses of papers, extending from top to
bottom, ranged around on every side, all filled with Archives of differ-
ent places; one third of which were designated or pointed out, as
Louisiana and Florida documents. Besides these piles of books and
bundles of papers of a like character were indiscriminately placed,
sufficiently numerous to fill several other cases, making together, at
least, twenty tons of documents, the whole without methodical order,
indexes, or inventories.”—Out of these papers, Mr Robinson is re-
quired, first to select those, which he claims as belonging to the
U. States; of which descriptive lists are to be made by the Spanish
Commissioners, and submitted to the proper authority, who will then

alluded to, until the selection is completed, that process must neces-
sarily be gone through before a demand of any portion of the docu-
ments can be made with effect. It is proper to state that although
the Louisiana Archives, to which the United States are as justly
entitled, as to those of Florida, are not embraced in the terms of the
royal order, they have nevertheless, been put aside by the Agent,
without opposition, and instructions have been sent to our Minister,
at Madrid, to apply to the Spanish Government for such an extension
of the Order, as will ensure their delivery. The latest accounts from
Mr. Robinson, are to the 23d of December last, by which, it would
appear, that a further period of six Months will, probably, be required
for the completion of the business entrusted to him, but not longer,
unless some accident should intervene to produce extraordinary delay,
within which time, it is hoped, that an answer to the application
above mentioned, may be received from the Court of Spain, and
transmitted to the Captain General of Cuba for execution.—
It is impossible, from, the information received at this Department,
to pronounce positively upon the materiality of the papers, in question,
to the decision of the causes now pending before the Supreme Court,
but it appears to be the firm impression of the Agent of the Govern-
ment, to whom the selection is committed that they are essential
to an enlightened determination of the controversies alluded to, and
his general representations of their character are certainly calculated
to induce a concurrence in his opinion.—Among those which have
come under his observation, he enumerates royal orders and instruc-
tions to the Governors of Cuba, Florida and Louisiana in relation to
sales and donations of land; decrees of the Governors, and various
legal proceedings touching the same subject; documents explanatory
of the powers of the Colonial officers; regulations respecting the
rights and privileges of the Indians, and the trade and intercourse to
be carried on with them; Maps and Surveys; Notes of titles and books
of entry and record.—Some of these papers are said by Mr. Robinson
to relate directly to Panton Leslie & Co. and to John Forbes & Co.,
whose alleged grant from the Indians, is questioned by the former
Surveyor General of Louisiana and Florida,” in a report made by
him to the Spanish Government in the year 1822 comprising the
transactions of several years, previous to the cession of those provinces
to the United States.”—
I take this opportunity of mentioning that the decree of Cienfuegos,
formerly Captain General of Cuba, authorising the Governor of Flor-
ida to permit the alienation of certain lands by John Forbes & Co., to
84 Wincente Sebastian Pintado.

TO THE CHAIRMAN of the Committee of Territorys In the house of
Representatives.
SIR I beg permission to call your attention to the apportionment
and representation of Florida, in our Legislative Council—This
Territory has been for several years governed by a minority in its
Legislature—East and West Florida are not equal to the Middle
district in population and yet they elect Twelve members of eight-
een, which is the whole number of the Legislative Council—The
Governor, in the first instance made the apportionment, to the satis-
faction of all the districts—since that time the emigration has been
greatly in favour of the Middle district
By refference to the last census you will see in the year 1830 the
Middle district was nearly equal in population to all the residue of
Florida, and since that period it has become still greater
The Legislative council, have refused to make a new apportionment,
as directed by the act of Congress, and as the majority is from the
East & West we can never get a fair and just apportionment through
our Legislature—as both East & West, Florida must looss a part of
their present members *
I trust sir the gentlemen of your committee will lay before the house
a bill," making a new apportionment in this Territory according to the
White population of the several districts as returned by the last

The Undersigned has passed over the new Road lately opened
by Mr Nunes the mail Contractor. The Road is in very good condi-
tion, and affords additional facilities for the transportation of the
mail, between Mobile & Pensacola. There is a saving of distance of
about 12 miles. Mr Nunes has undoubtedly been at considerable
expence in opening the Road; and I should consider his estimate of
expenditures upon the same as not extravagant. The Road also
passes for the greater part of the distance through the public lands.
For the above reasons I would recommend that Mr Nunes be reim-

the U. States before the Judge of the Superior Court, of the District
in which the land was situated in order to try their title, and gave
the Judges in each of the Districts, an additional compensation of
eight hundred dollars over and above the regular salary, on account
of the new duty thus imposed on them—The appropriation act of
March 2nd 1833," provides this additional compensation, “for two
of the Judges” without designating which two were to receive it.—
and there being four Districts in Florida, this Department did not
feel itself authorized to decide between them, and give the additional
salary to any two of them to the exclusion of the others. If it was
the intention of Congress, to exclude two of the Judges from the
additional compensation it is necessary that a law should pass desig-
nating the two to whom it is to be paid—and if the additional com-
pensation was intended to be given to the four, it is then necessary
that a further appropriation should be made to cover the omission.
I transmit herewith the copy of a letter from Richd K. Call," Esquire,
the assistant counsel of the U. States in the Territory of Florida,—
and also the copy of a letter from Thomas Douglass Esquire," the
District Attorney of the U. States for the Eastern District, stating
the number of suits against the U. States, in the different courts of
the Territory. It appears from these letters that in the Western and
Middle District, the law giving jurisdiction to the courts, in these
cases, imposed scarcely any additional trouble on the Judges, and
there was no sufficient reason for allowing to them the additional sum
of $800.—The Southern District has now but very few cases—and
the mass of the business appears to have been in the Eastern District
where ninety-nine cases were depending against the U. States in
June last.”
Under these circumstances I presume that the appropriation law
of last session was intended to provide the additional compensation
for the Judges of the Southern and Eastern Districts.” But the state
of the business can hardly justify the continuance of the additional
compensation to the former for the present year.
I therefore respectfully recommend that in order to remove the
uncertainty in the appropriation before made, an appropriation of
sixteen hundred dollars be now made for the payment of the addi-
tional compensation of eight hundred dollars each to the Judges of
the Superior Courts of the Southern and Eastern Districts of the
Territory of Florida, for the year 1833, and that an appropriation

ELBERT HERRING Esq. Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
SIR, I have the honor herewith to transmit to you a Copy of a
letter from Gen' Wiley Thompson, Agent of the Florida Indians, to
me dated the 31* ultimo, And a copy of my answer to the same
bearing date the 2" Inst.” These letters relate, as you will see, to
the situation of those Indians who are now ready to leave the United
States. If I had drawn on the Department for the amount required
to pay that part of the annuity, which the chiefs Blount and Davy
are entitled to receive under the treaty of 1832,” it would have been
an unauthorized act on my part—No draft, however, could, at this
time, be cashed here or short of Mobile or New-Orleans for hard
Dollars, which is the only Money these Indians will receive, as they
are to leave the United States.
Under the circumstances detailed in Gen.' Thompson's letter, I
directed him to supply rations to Blount's and Davy's bands, should
they be detained for the funds they expect from the Government,
and trust the Department will approve the course I have directed the
Agent to pursue.
It is important that I should early receive specific instructions in
relation to the execution of the late Treaties with the Several Indian
tribes—If any large number are to emigrate during the present year,
it is time to prepare for their removal.
The reports of the Indian Agent, and my several communications
on this Subject, have no doubt been received by you, and from a
full knowledge of the causes operating on the minds of the Indians,
as well as of their temper and feelings, leave no doubt, that with all
the active aid of the Department, it will be no easy task to consummate
the wishes of the Government—The Agent and Sub Agent are de-
sirous of learning what compensation they may expect for extra

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY TRUSTEES OF PENSACOLA
ACADEMY
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS"]
[February 6, 1834]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the United
States:
The Memorial of the Trustees of the Pensacola Academy most re-
spectfully represents:
That deeply impressed with the importance of Education to the
rising generation: your Memorialists are endeavouring to give efficacy
to the Act of the Legislative Council of Florida under which they
were appointed,” by establishing a Seminary adequate to the Literary
wants of this Community: In their exertions they meet with many
obstacles from the want of Funds to enable them to erect the Building
necessary for an Academy. From the School Lands heretofore set
apart by your Honourable Body for the Support of Common Schools"
the Institution under the charge of your Memorialists, has never re-
ceived the least benefit. Those lands have never been rented or
leased out within the Knowledge of your Memorialists, and if they
have No Funds arising therefrom have ever been paid into the hands
of your Memorialists, or their Predecessors in Office.
With the Confidence of Children towards a Kind Parent, your
Memorialists look to their Government, with the earnest hope and
Confident expectation, that out of the Abundant Means within the
Power of that Government, something will be extended towards
furthering the object which we have in view; Your Memorialists are
perfectly Confident that Congress is fully aware of the benefits of
encouraging Education—that to make good Citizens, their minds
must be enlightend—that to perpetuate Liberty and our blessed
form of Government its Citizens must be enlightend enough to ap-
preciate those blessings, Congress has hitherto been a liberal Patron
to the Cause of Education; Your Memorialists will not doubt, but
that the same, wise, generous and patriotic feelings will continue to
influence your Honourable Body
In looking around for a Source for Funds sufficient to enable your
Memorialists to build an Academy adequate to the wants of Pensa-
cola, the attention of your Memorialists have been drawn to certain
Lots within the City of Pensacola belonging to the Government of
the United States, these Lots are known upon the Plan of said City

motives of economy the law was repealed," and since that period,
these officers have been obliged to compensate any persons they have
employed out of their private funds, except then small allowances
have been made for special services by the general government. At
present the offices of the Executive, Secretary, Treasurer, and Auditor
are not occupied except during office hours on the day, and at night
they are exposed to the depredations of any incendiary or mischevious
person. Valuable documents and papers and in fact the original laws
and journals are liable to be abstracted or destroyed by those who
may be interested in their absence or destruction. The Executive
deemd it his duty to bring this subject to the attention of the Coun-
cil.—In the present insecure condition of the Capitol, the responsibility
of the safe preservation of the public records should be imposed upon
the public officers. The accumulation of business renders the em-
ployment of a Clerk necessary, and the security of the records requires
that some one should occupy the offices during the night.—Without

The Memorialists allege that they are the owners of a number of
slaves removed several years ago from Virginia to the Territory of

ten dollars a head on all the slaves of non residents which shall be
hired out without reference to the amount for which said slaves may
have been hired;" that an ex post facto operation was given to this
enactment by applying it to slaves hired out several weeks before the
passage of the law, and that the same or perhaps another law subjects

The Committee are satisfied that the memorialists are entitled to
relief—It is certainly against the policy of the United States as well
as the dictates of common justice to allow any Territorial Legislature
to tax the property of non residents higher than the same property
of resident citizens—

approved, and the annuity will be paid in the proportions, indicated
by him. You are requested to represent to Blunt and Davy, that this
delay in the payment of the annuity cannot be admitted as a valid
reason for their delaying to emigrate. They will receive their money
as promptly at their new residence, as they would, if they remained
where they now are.”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
[NA:SF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.: DS*]
[February 12, 1834]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United.
States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Legislative Council of Florida, respectfully
sheweth, That by reason of the recent settlement, of this Territory,
and the sparseness of its population, and other disadvantages incident
to a new country, the people of this Territory are unable to undertake,
without aid from your honourable body, the many important public
improvements so necessary to their wellfare, and of which Florida is
more eminently susceptible, with [more]” certain prospect of ad-
vantage, than any other portion of the Union.
The people of Florida, whom your Memorialists represent, and in
whose behalf they now address the National Legislature, conceive
they have a just right to ask at the hands of Congress such assistance.
An appeal to the United States as our parent government; for necessary
support and help, will not, we are persuaded, be totally unheard and
disregarded. A large portion of the lands in Florida are suitable, and
its climate (as has been proved by the unerring test of experience
favourable to the profitable cultivation of the sugar cane and the

manufacture of sugar. Many of our enterprising planters, notwith-
standing they commenced the experiment under the most serious
disadvantages, comparatively unacquainted with the mode of culti-
vating the plant and manufacture of the article, have so succeeded in
both, as to excite the most sanguine and flattering anticipations of
the future prosperity and wealth of Florida. The time. it is believed.
is not far distant when. if the sugar planters of Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Georgia. are afforded but a little of that countenance
and aid from the National Government, which has been so liberally
extended to other interests, they will be enabled to furnish a sufficiency
of sugar for the consumption of our whole country, and that at a
cost reduced from that of the present importation.
The probability and even possibility of such a result affords a
cogent appeal, not only to the patriotism but to the interests of our
common country. The accomplishment of this object, is of such
paramount importance, as to justify under different circumstances
of prosperity and when our condition as a nation should be less
flourishing than at present the extension by the National Legislature
of the most liberal aid towards it. But at a time when the coffers
of our national Treasury are overflowing when the chief contention
among our statesmen seems to be as to the disposition of the surplus
there should be no hesitancy in contributing a small portion of the
common fund to be thus applied to the aid and on account of the
general interests. the National Government are yet the proprietors
of nineteen-twentieths of all the lands in Florida. Apart from the
duty of protection devolving on the United States, and laying aside
the considerations of justice and patriotism it is respectfully sub-
mitted that the citizens of Florida, the proprietors of the remaining
twentieth have a well grounded right to claim of the General Govern-
ment a fair and pro rata contribution towards the cost of all works
conducive to the improvement and calculated to advance the value
of its domain: The propriety and force of this argument must be
admitted by every just and unprejudiced mind. In no other section
of the Union where the aid sought could be rendered without en-
countering constitutional objections from many enlightened states-
men does the same obvious and imposing necessity exist for the as-
sistance of Congress, in bringing into beneficial action the resourses
of the country as in Florida. Except at two or three points Our
Territory has been inhabited principally by the red sons of the forrest,
till since its purchase by this Government by Spain but little induce-
ment existed, had opportunity and means been afforded the former
white population of Florida to remove the obstructions which impede
the safe and easy navigation of most of our rivers. Different circum-
stances enabled and induced the first settlers in Louisiana and other

parts of the Union to construct many of the most necessary of their
artificial works, to give life and vigour to the superior natural ad-
vantages of the country. hence it is those sections are a quarter of
a century in advance of Florida in agricultural improvement: The
accumulated labours of the two last generations are now upon our
hands. What the first settlers of other parts of the Union performed
for the population that has succeeded them it devolves upon us to
do for ourselves and the future citizens of Florida. The aid rendered
by the French government at the early settlement of Louisiana in
the construction of the levees on the Mississippi, and the general
improvement of the country, was of the most liberal character, and
is yet beneficially felt by the inhabitants. To that aid is attributable
in no small degree the rapid but permanent advancement and steadily
increasing prosperity and wealth of that State. With similar as-
sistance from the National Government the labours of the citizens
of Florida will produce equal, if not more beneficial results. Without
such assistance, all expectation of the construction of any but a few
of the least expensive and most unimportant improvements for the
causes stated must be abandoned: A quarter of a century at least
must elapse before we shall have the wealth and strength to under-
take the principal works unaided and alone. This Legislative Council
indulge the hope that the enlightened representatives of a great en-
terprising and free people in the full tide of prosperity will not defer
to a future generation the glory of thus laying the foundation of an
enduring testimonial of their forecast and wise liberality. They
trust that the enjoyment of the invaluable benefits in certain prospect
to ourselves and those who come after us, resulting from such im-
provements may not be postponed as in the period of infancy we most
feel the necessity of such aid. The particular object of this memorial
is, however, to ask from the general Congress an appropriation of
nine thousand dollars to be expended in clearing out the river Chipola
in West Florida, from its mouth to the natural bridge on said river
contiguous to the town of Marianna.
This river with the appropriation above increased by the gratuitous
aid of the citizens residing near it can be made navigable for large
keel boats to the point beforementioned. The character of the ob-
structions to be removed and an estimate of the costs upon which
the foregoing statement is predicated is to be found in a communica-
tion from an efficient and intelligent engineer in the service of the
United States, A copy of which is hereunto annexed;” and which

merous and respectable portion of the people of West Florida has

been heretofore forwarded to our Delegate in Congress. To the
document hereunto appended, your memorialists refer as showing
the importance and beneficial character of the work contem-
plated. Your memorialists would, however in addition mention
one or two facts, not specially noticed in said communication
and which it is respectfully submitted, should be entitled to the
peculiar attention of Congress. Experience has proved that if
sugar is transported whenever any considerable distance by land
and in ordinary waggons the costs thereof is not only greatly in-
creased but the article itself depreciates in quality. Owing to
this circumstance and the obstructions beforementioned existing to the
safe navigation of most of our streams a considerable portion of the
best sugar lands in Florida have not been appropriated to the culture
of the cane. It is as yet only in the immediate vicinity of the principal
waters that our sugar planters have ventured to establish themselves.
This difficulty exists as to the cultivation of but few other products
and an important argument is thereby afforded in favour of improve-
ments in Florida not applicable to sections where the sugar cane
cannot be cultivated. At the head of the Chipola river is a large
body of rich land equal in fertility and as eminantly and peculiarly
adapted to the culture of the cane as perhaps any to be found on our
Southern coast. A considerable portion of these lands are now the
property of Government but the contemplated improvement of the
Chipola would no doube enhance the value and occasion their speedy
sale. Wherefore your memorialists in behalf of the people of Florida
generally, and specially, in aid, of those who reside near the Chipola,
ask from your honourable bodies the appropriation aforesaid.
Resolved, That the above memorial be signed by the President
and certified by the Chief Clerk of this House; and that the same
together with the accompanying document be forthwith forwarded
to our Delegate” in Congress.”

RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]
[February 13, 1834]
Whereas, the late ill advised arrangement as to the transportation
of the mails between St. Augustine and Tallahassee, which it is under-
stood, was made by an agent of the General Post office, possessing
little knowledge of the country, is presented by the Grand Jury of the
counties of Alachua, Columbia and Hillsborough as a grievance to
the inhabitants of those counties, and as detrimental to the interests
of a growing and flourishing portion of our Territory, -as in fact,
virtually excluding them from the benefits of the Post Office Estab-
lishment—depriving them of the facilities of communication, and
closing against them the avenues of intelligence, by the wisdom of our
Government generally open and free to the people of the United
States.
A great privation to the inhabitants of these counties—without
even the inducement of a pecuniary saving thereby to the Post Office
Department.
And whereas, also, From the presentments of the same Grand Jury,
the importance and great value of a public road from Newnansville to
St. Augustine, by the way of Spring Grove, Micanope and Palatka are
most manifest, as a sure means of advancing not only private property,
and prosperity, but also the interests of the middle States, in quicken-
ing the sale, and enhancing the prices of the public lands, so fertile
and extensive in that section of our Territory.

REPORT OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL COMMITTEE
ON STATE OF THE TERRITORY
[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]
[February 13, 1834]
Mr. Ward from the committee on the State of the Territory, to
whom was referred an enquiry, as to the propriety of submitting to
the people of Florida, the question of state government, made the
following report:
The committee on the state of the Territory in conformity with a
resolution adopted on the 23d ultimo, having had under consideration
the matters therein contained, have the honor to
REPORT:
That they consider the subject of the adoption of a State Govern-
ment as of primary importance, as involving deeply the interests
of the Territory, and as proper at this time, to be submitted to the
serious consideration of the people of Florida. That while on the
one hand, it would be unwise and imprudent, rashly and without
resources, to precipitate an event of this character; we shall on the
other, be not less culpably wanting to ourselves, if we remain insensible
to the disadvantages of our present state of provincial vassalage.

The responsibility of the individuals imbued with the power of
enacting and administering the laws to those whose interests are
affected by their operation, is a principle upon which is based the
whole system of republican institutions. and however much the
General Government may be actuated by a desire to promote the
views and foster the interests can be as well understood as by the
people themselves; or if understood, that they will meet with due
consideration, amid the pressure of the many important and con-
flicting interests which occupy the attention of Congress and the
Federal Executive. We are placed at an immense distance from the
centre of our Governmental system. We are liable to have sent
among us by appointment of the Government, officers unacquainted
with the policy and interests of the Territory, destitute of those
claims upon the confidence of the the people, which are acquired by
residence, intercourse, and community of sentiment; and above all,
irresponsible to those who are to be vitally affected by their official
acts. Nor is this irresponsibility confined to themselves alone—It
extends itself to those officers, of which the creation has been imparted
to the people. It is easy for the Legislature to attribute to the Execu-
tive, Judicial, or ministerial Government officer, the faults of improv-
ident or corrupt Legislation; and it is as easy for the other to disguise
or avoid the responsibility of malfeasance or neglect of duty, by the
real or imputed derelictions of those holding office from the people.
Another baneful effect of the present system of appointments, is
felt in the enervating influence upon the characters and energies of
a country having no rewards to hold out to tried and faithful public
services. So much is this the case, that it is believed the policy of
the Government has been to appoint to office, strangers to the Terri-
tory and its citizens, in preference to residents of equal talents and
abilities; and who, added to these, those claims which are derived
from a long intercourse with the people of the Territory, and character
and integrity appreciated by them. In the absence of the high and
animating inducements which are held out to talent, virtue and
patriotism, in the grateful confidence of a free people, the population
of our country is retarded, its energies repressed, and enterprise and
public spirit paralyzed
Another consideration connected with the moral and intellectual
advancement of the country, strongly urges the adoption of a govern-
ment of our own, as soon as it may be in our power. Throughout our
widely extended Territory, the want of some system which will bring
education within reach of the yeoman and mechanic, is already sen-
sibly felt. With all the natural advantages which we possess, with a
soil as fertile, and a climate as propitious as ours, and with a popula-

tion, which for enterprise and intelligence, is without a parallel in a
frontier country, we shall still fall short of the destiny which would
seem to await us, if we fail to provide the means of education for the
generation who are to succeed us. To effect this object, the care of
the General Government has made an adequate provision in the
sixteenth sections of land reserved for the use of Schools, and two
townships to be devoted to the endowment of a University. But
these means are withheld by the prudent policy of the Government
until we become a State, in no point of view, perhaps, does the urgent
expediency of the step now under consideration, present itself more
strongly.
But the enquiry must first be made, are we competent to the effort?
What are our resources, when the support of the General Government
shall have been withdrawn? Is our population such as to render a
movement upon the subject feasible? or to give assurance of a capa-
bility on our part to sustain the increased expenditure?
By the 6th article of the Treaty of cession, it is guarantied that
the inhabitants of the Territory of Florida shall be incorporated in
the Union, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the
Federal Constitution.” It is believed, that there is nothing in that
instrument prohibitory of the accomplishment of this guaranty. The
3d section of the 4th article of the Constitution, gives to Congress
power to admit new States into the Union: And the 3d section of the
first article, which established the ratio of representation, also pro-
vides that “Each State shall have at least one representative.”
Clearly recognizing the principle, that a State may exist or conse-
quently be created, although not having the number of inhabitants,
which constitutes the basis of the ratio. But even supposing that a
different construction should be put upon the last cited section, still
it is believed, that we may as matter of right demand admission. The
population of Florida by the last Census, amounted to thirty-four
thousand five hundred, and presuming upon a probable ratio of
increase since that period, the Territory must now contain near forty-
five thousand inhabitants. When we take into consideration further,
that the portion of the Territory hitherto occupied by the Seminole
Indians is about to invite a numerous population, and that before
another Census can be taken, or even the measures now considered of,
carried into effect, the place of those savages will be doubly supplied
from adjoining States. Your Committee feel themselves justified in
the conclusion, that no obstacle on the score of population will oppose
the proposed change in the form of our government.

F L Q RIDA. T E R R H TO R Y 971
Assuming then the fact, of our right to ask of the Congress of the
United States, a fulfilment of the stipulation in the treaty of cession
above referred to, let us inquire into the condition in which we shall
be placed in respect of our internal resources.
There are annually expended by the United States, in the support
of the Territorial Government, perhaps forty thousand dollars. Of
this sum, however, by far the greater part consists of the salaries of
officers which would still subsist after establishment of a State
Government. The United States Courts would still be maintained.
The Custom Houses, Land Offices, &c. would still be continued
We already pay the salaries of officers of the Territorial Treasury.
The only additional expenses, therefore, for which we should have to
provide, would be the salaries of the two Executive officers, of a State
Judiciary, and the expenses of the Legislative Department. Of these,
taking the present salaries and pay under each of the two first heads,
as a sufficiently liberal criterion, and allowing for the latter double
the amount now appropriated by Government, the gross amount, it
may be safely affirmed, will not exceed annually twenty thousand
dollars. To this sum, add ten thousand dollars for contingencies
and occasional appropriations, and it will appear that thirty thousand
dollars will afford the requisite annual revenue. It remains now to
inquire whether we may safely incur such annual expenditure, with
an assurance of deriving the moneys to meet it, from any moderate
system of taxation.
The amount of revenue payable annually into the Territorial Treas-
ury, according to the assessments under our present system, is perhaps
equal to between ten and twelve thousand dollars. But it is con-
fidently believed, that under a more strict and vigilant care, it would
amount to at least one-third more without any increase in the rate of
taxes. If the Revenue bill now pending in the House, should pass
into a law, it is probable that fifteen thousand will be annually raised,
the taxes remaining at their present standard. Upon a comparison
of our Revenue Laws with those of the States, it will be found that
the Territorial taxes are not more than one-third in proportion to
those which are levied in the States, and that in many instances, we
fail to exact any tax from many species of property, which are there
legitimate and lucrative sources of revenue. Our taxes upon land
are almost nominal, and are so estimated, that the true taxable
value of the land is not justly ascertained. The tax upon town
property is notoriously so low, as to make it impossible to be collected,
the amount due from a large portion of proprietors, not reaching to
more than fractions of cents. Again, in many, if not all of the States,
the list of taxable property is given in on the oath of the owner,
and adequate pecuniary penalties imposed for fraudulent conceal-

ments of taxable property. The want of such provisions in our Revenue
system, tends materially to diminish the Revenue.
From all this, it is believed, it may with safety be assumed, that
without raising the rates of taxation above the standard common to
most of the States, it is in our power to provide means for maintaining
a State Government.
There is still another view of this subject, to which your committee
will briefly allude. It is believed that the mere fact of being a Ter-
ritory, has the effect to repress emigration.—The idea always prevails,
that in a frontier territory, the laws are weak and inefficient, and the
people semi-barbarous. Individuals possessed of wealth, are in many
instances deterred from embarking their fortuns in a territory,
having no settled form of Government, and whose future prosperity
depends upon the problematical issue of becoming a State or not, and,
in becoming a State, upon the character of the Constitution and
Laws which she may adopt. This impediment removed, there can
be no doubt that wealth, enterprise, intelligence and talent will
flow into our country, increasing and placing beyond the possibility
of doubt, its resources for a State revenue.
Entertaining these views, and believing it proper to elicit an
expression of public opinion upon the subject, the committee have
reported a Bill in conformity with the terms of the Resolution referred
to them, and pray to be discharged from further consideration of the
subject.

REPORT OF A SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]
[February 14, 1834]
Mr. Blount from the select committe, to whom was referred a
communication from his Excellency the Governor, made the following
Report:
The Select Committee to whom was referred the Message of the
Governor of the 25th of January, in relation to the Election of Chief
Magistrate of this Territory by the people thereof, beg leave to
REPORT:
That while they disclaim any intention of exception to the present
incumbents of the offices of Governor and Secretary, as to the manner
in which they have discharged their duties, or otherwise, they agree

with the Executive in opinion, that the election of those officers is
properly a right belonging to the people. Howmuch soever, well
satisfy the people of Florida have reason to be, with the officers
selected by the National Government, the exercise of this right, is
too valuable to be yielded without necessity. It is the foundation
of every Republican Government. Deprived as we are, of all par-
ticipation or influence in the choice of the Chief Officers of our Ter-
ritory, denied also, a voice in the Election of our National rulers, we
are rather the subjects of Colonial vassalage, than the citizens of a
free republic,-Our present system of Government is totally incon-
sistent with the genius of free institutions. Why should we be
denied a more equal participation of the blessings of free Government
with our fellow citizens of the States? Are we alone incapable of
self Government? That no people are! is the every day argument
of despots, against liberal institutions, and may as well be urged
against the National and State Governments of this Union, as against
the people of Florida. We may be yet poor, and unable to support
a State Government, and hence our application for admission into
the Union should be deferred. But, does our want of wealth render
us incapable of exercising our judgments in the selection of our officers?
The pages of History show, that it is when a people have become
enervated by wealth and ease, and luxury, that they relax their
vigilance, become careless, and exhibit apathy in the choice of their
magistrates. A community in the vigor and strength of youth,
although poor, is not prone to become inert or negligent on such
subjects.
The aborigines of the country it is anticipated are soon to be re-
moved west of the Mississippi, and no interests of the United States
can exist, the protection of which will devolve upon the Executive
of Florida. The public domain is under the control of other officers,
and the other national concerns in Florida have each their distinct
and independent guardian.
The committee, although it was not specially referred to them,
have deemed it advisable to suggest as connected with this subject
the propriety of an application to Congress for a Senate as it allowed
in the Territories of Arkansas and Michigan.” On former occasions,
the arguments in favor of allowing such application have been fully
* Michigan Territory had no second or upper House during its legal existence
as a territory; its legislation was enacted by a Legislative Council. It was only
after the formation of a State Constitution in 1835, preparatory to seeking
admission as a state, that a Senate was provided. See Terr. Papers (Mich.),
XII, 997, 1000. Arkansas Territory was promoted to the second grade of gov-
ernment, with an elected House and a Council or upper House, in 1820 (op. cit,
(Ark.), XIX, 133).

made known to Congress, through the Delegate from this Territory.
The committee can but reiterate those arguments, with the super-
added sanction that experience has given to their truth, and request
the Delegate to urge their importance.
The committee beg leave to recommend the adoption of the ac-
companying resolutions, and pray to be discharged from the further
consideration of the subject.

RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR MAIL
ROUTES
[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]
[February 14, 1834]
Mr. Ward heretofore, offered the following Preamble and Resolu-
tion, to wit:
Whereas, it is desirable for the accommodation and convenience
of the people of Florida, that facilities of communication should exist
between the seat of the Territorial Government, the town of Jackson-
ville, and the City of St. Augustine in the Eastern District of Florida,—
and whereas it will be but just to afford the same facilities of mail
transportation to the Eastern of the Territory, as are already enjoyed
by the West, in a semi-weekly mail from Pensacola to Tallahassee.
And Whereas, it is believed that such an arrangement would promote
the views of Government, and the public interest and convenience,
by opening a direct communication between Savannah and Mobile,
or New Orleans, with less than 240 miles of land carriage, over a
country offering decided advantages for mail transportation. There-
fore,
Be it resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida,
That the Delegate in Congress from this Territory be requested to
urge upon the attention of the proper department the establishment

of a semiweekly mail, or if that be impracticable, a weekly mail,
to be transported in four horse coaches, from Tallahassee to Jackson-
ville, on the St. John's river, and thence to the city of St. Augustine.
Which was again read and adopted.
THEATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[NA:JD, Atty. Gen. Lets. Sent, Bk. A 2]
ATTORNEY GENERAL's OFFICE February 15th 1834.
SIR I have the honor herewith to return to the State Department
the several documents transmitted to me with your letter of the 34
and 10" instant.” The case of Colin Mitchell particularly referred
to in these papers, has been continued until the next term of the
Supreme Court; but as there seems to be no good reason for adopting
the like course in respect to the cases from East Florida the Court
directed them to be brought on for hearing at the present term, and
several of them are now under discussion.
Permit me to suggest that there is no reason to believe that another
continuance of the case of Mitchell can be obtained; and that it is
therefore a matter of the highest gravest importance to the interest
involved in that case, that the investigation now in progress at
Hanana, should be prosecuted with the greatest dillegence and that
if any material documents should be found they ought without delay
to be furnished to the counsel of the Government. It is also proper
to remark that it was objected by the Counsel for M" Mitchell on
the argument of the motion for a continuance of his case. that royal
orders, commissions, and instructions issued by the Crown of Spain
to the Governors and Intendents of Louisiana, the Florida's and
Cuba ought to be sought for at Madrid, and not at the Havana and
that it therefore was not highly improbable that any documents of
this nature would be found at this place.
Without entirely yealding to this objection the counsel for the
Government are so far impressed with a conviction of its truth,
that they feel it their duty to request that another effort be made
through the American Minister at Spain to obtain authenticated
copies of the various royal orders & other papers indicated in an
opinion & order of the Supreme Court delivered in the cases of
Soulard & Smith in 1830.8° and in the letters of Mr Wirt of 1830 *
& 1833.” now on file in the State department. From the nature of

the subjects & upon the peculiar institutions and practice of the

question must all have been recorded in the proper departments at

grounds on which copies can be denied to the American Government.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States.—
The Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, beg leave,
again, respectfully to ask the attention of the Federal Government to
the important project of effecting a communication between the At-
lantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico across the Florida Peninsula.
The excavation of the Ship Channel so long, and so anxiously con-

to wit: by the Construction of a Rail Road across the upper neck of
the Pinsula from the town of Jacksonville on the St. Johns River, to
the Gulf of Mexico at the disemboguement of the river St. Marks.
The District of Country through which this Rail Road would pass,
affords advantages, certainly not surpassed, perhaps not equalled in
any portion of the United States of the same extent throughout the
whole distance. The Country is level, of firm, solid foundation and
the few rivers which the Road would cross are never subject to high
or rapid freshets. In every portion of the route is found in the greatest
abundance the finest timber in the world for such a construction, and
a mild and delightful climate, where frost and ice never occur to
impede its operation.
The Legislative Council, impressed with the belief that it is a
measure perfectly practicable in its accomplishment and highly
important in its consequences, not only with reffere [MS. torn] the
interests and prosperity of the Territory of Florida but Peeeived
believed in National light, as forming the most important link in the
chain of inland communication between the extreme north and South,
have at their present session incorporated “The Florida Peninsula, &
Jacksonville Rail Road” Company,” to construct a Rail Road from
Jacksonville to Tallahassee,” a distance of about one hundred and
forty five miles in a strait line to be there connected with the Talla-
hassee and St. Marks Rail Road, also Chartered at the present
Session; * Without the aid of the General Government, this Great
undertaking will be retarded for many years, or perhaps, totally fail
of accomplishment. They therefore pray the attention of your
honourable Body to the following Resolutions.
Be it therefore resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council
of Florida, That the Delegate in Congress be requested to obtain from
the Congress of the United, the appointment of an experienced Engi-
neer to survey the route of the Contemplated Rail Road from Jackson-
ville to Tallahassee; and also to obtain the relinquishment on the part
of the United States in favour of said Company of one mile on each
side of the said route of the public lands through which it may pass—
And be it further resolved that the Delegate be further requested to
obtain from Congress such appropriations of money, donations of
land, or subscriptions to the stock of said Rail Road company, as
their wisdom, and the importance of the object may suggest or
justify—Be it further resolved that the foregoing memorial and

RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL RE

[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS *]
|February 16, 1834]
Whereas the proper and full developement of the resources of a
country has been always deemed by its supreme authority a matter
of Interest policy and wisdom and whereas it is considered a point
of moment to acquire if possible correct and definite information as
to the nature and character of so much of the Territory as is in an
incultivated state and whereas also the construction of a public road
from the city of St Augustine to Cape Florida and affording facilities
of communication, and transportation throughout the peninsula
would contribute effectually to the objects above contemplated,
Therefore be it Resolved by the Legislative Council of Florida that
our Delegate in Congress be requested to use his best efforts towards
obtaining an appropriation of a sufficient sum of money to defray
the expenses of the commissioners herin after contemplated to
be appointed
Resolved that he be also requested to use his exertions in reccom-

Report of the Committee on Finance of the Legislative Council
In the Legislative Council of Florida Feby 11th 1834.
Mr. Chandler from the committee on Finance, to whom was
referred, an enquiry touching the compilation of the laws of Florida,
made the following
REPORT:
The committee on Finance to whom was referred the resolution
respecting the publication of the compilation of the statutes of this
Territory respectfully report,
That in answer to enquiries made by them in compliance with said
resolution they have received a communication from one of the com-
pilers, which is hereto annexed. By this communication it appears
the work is nearly completed, and is expected to be ready for distribu-
tion with the laws of this session. The committee have examined
the book as far as finished, and consider it well executed, in point of
typography, and also that the system and arrangement adopted by
the compiler has been judicious, and that the work will be valuable
to the community. The book is more voluminous than was antici-
pated, being nearly 500 pages, and some delay has thereby, and by
other causes, been occasioned, to its being finished, but as it could
not have been distributed throughout the Territory till an appropri-
ation was made by Congress, therefor, no disadvantage has resulted
to the Territory. It appears also that the amount originally appropri-
ated by Congress to defray the expenses of publication," (although
the compilers render their services gratitously,) is insufficient & ef that
the contractors will probably sustain a loss in consequence thereof.
The committee deem it advisable and important that a publication
of the laws of '33, and '34, should be made on the same plan, and in
the same manner, as has been pursued in the compilation up to
'32, and in order to make up the deficit in the former appropriation
to the contractors and to obtain a continuance of the work in an
uniform manner they herewith report a bill and resolution to the
house.
EDWARD CHANDLER, Chairman.
* The appropriation act approved May 5, 1832 (4 STAT. 511), provided $2,000
for the publication of the statutes of the territory. A resolution of the Legis-
lative Council, Feb. 3, 1831 (Fla. Terr. Acts, 1831, p. 96), had requested the dele-
gate to obtain an appropriation of $1,500 for the publication of the statutes.

AND WEBB
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred February 24, 1834]
To The Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States in Congress Assembled.
The Memorial of the Undersigned Judges of the United States
for the District of Middle Florida, of East Florida, and of the Southern
District of Florida respectfully represents
That by the act of 23rd May 1828 supplementary to the several
acts for the settlement and confirmation of private Land Claims in
Florida,” in consideration of the duties thereby enjoined upon
your Memorialists an additional Salary of Eight hundred dollars per
annum was secured to them while in the discharge of the duties im-
posed by said act. That your Memorialists continued to receive
said salary up to the end of the first quarter of the past year, when
in consequence of a failure in the last appropriation act to provide
for the payment of said salary to all the Judges, or to designate for
which two of them the provision in said act was intended, the Officers
of the Treasury, refused to pay it to either and thus the provision has
been withheld from them all."
They would further represent that although the duties arising
under said Law have been very unequally divided amongst said
Judges (by far the greater number of cases existing in the Eastern
District) Yet in point of fact, one or more cases still continue un-
decided in all the Districts including the Western District”
That it has not been owing to the conduct of your Memorialists
that the said cases have not been finally disposed of in some of the
Districts but to the wishes of the Officers representing the United
States at whose instance, the causes have been continued for the
purpose of receiving further evidence.

Your memorialists therefore respectfully urge that all the Judges,
are by the Terms of the Law and in justice entitled to a continuance
of the additional salary until all the causes are finally adjudicated
and settled; And they therefore pray that an appropriation be made
by your Honorable Body as well for the arreas due as for its future
payments.
Your Memorialists would further beg leave to avail themselves of
this occasion to present to the attention of Congress the inadiquacy
of their Salaries, and to request that a permanent and suitable pro-
vision be made for their relief The present salaries were established
at the first Organization of the Courts when their duties were com-
paratively light. At that time and for some years thereafter there
existed but one court with two terms in each District and with an
inhibition by Law to the Legislative Council to establish more than
one other other Court in each District. In the year 1826 a court of
Appeals was established composed of the Judges of the several Dis-
tricts" and the prohibition being removed the Legislative Council
have since established numerous Courts in most of the Districts by
which the duties and labours of the Judges have been greatly in-
creased. That the rapid increase of population and the consequent
increase of business have contributed to the same results As an evi-
dence of which it may be stated that in circuits composed of several
courts, in some of the Courts where the business at first was merely
nominal the Judges are now frequently closely occupied twice a year
from three to five and six weeks. In three of the Districts the Judges
are now obliged by law to hold from eight to eleven terms of Court
each year besides attending the court of appeals annually, and in the
other District there are held twelve or fifteen extra terms for the
trial of admiralty causes in addition to the regular terms of the Court.
These numerous Courts in a widely extended and sparsely settled
country expose them to very great labors and expenses in travelling
while no provision whatever is made by law for the payment of any
travelling or other expences incident to these courts or to the court
of Appeals.
They would further state that the business of the Court of Appeals
(a Court created since the salaries were fixed by Law) has also greatly
increased, the present Term being only now about to expire after a
a session of more than four weeks—They beg leave to remind your
Honorable body that the sphere of duties assigned to the Judges of
Florida besides embracing all matters cognizable in the District and
circuit courts of the United States include the cognizance of all causes
1. This court was established in 1825 pursuant to Sec. 4 of the act approved
May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 46).

of a civil nature above One hundred dollars as part of their original
Jurisdiction as also exclusive criminal Jurisdiction of all offences
against the Laws of the United States and of the Territory of Florida
They excercise moreover appellate Jurisdiction over all the inferior
Courts and Justices of the Peace in the Territory.
Taking all these circumstances, into consideration they venture to
assert that their duties and labors greatly exceed those of any District
Judge of the United States. And they may also add that from the
present condition of the country such duties necessarily involve
greater expense of living, impose more personal privations, and
subject to greater exposure of health than are incident to the office
of any District Judge of the United States
While the additional salary of Eight hundred dollars continued to
be received your Memorialists forebore to complain altho convinced
that even with that provision their compensation was inadiquate.
But now that they are to look to the tirmination of this provision
so soon as the duties under the law shall cease they cannot in justice
to themselves longer delay the representation of their case"
They therefore respectfully request that the Honorable the Congress
of the United States will be pleased to make such permanent and
additional provision for them as may be deemed reasonable and
Just,—And Your Memorialists will ever pray &".”

with the interior of the Teritory and States of the Union. During
the first six months of the last year our Mail was transported in Steam
Boats direct to Columbus, Georgia; but from the great expence at-
tending this mode of conveyance, together with the difficulty of
navigating the river during the Summer months the Post-Master
General has been induced to discontinue the route, and for several
months past, your memorialists have had no regular mail communica-
tion with any part of the United States. Situated at the mouth of the
river Apalachicola,—The only outlet to the rich products of her
tributaries the Chattahootchie, Flint and Chipola rivers, extending
for several hundred miles into the States of Georgia and Alabama—
With a population and business which already entitle us to rank in
Commercial importance as the Third Port in the Gulph of Mexico–
A commerce giving employment to twelve Ships and Brigs as regular
Packets to New-York and an equal number of Brigs and Schooners
to New-Orleans, besides a large number of transient Vessels to those,
and other ports of the United States, and West Indies. And at this
time several large Wessels are taking in Cargoes for Liverpool, which
is designed as the commencement of a direct Commercial intercourse
with Europe. The estimated value of the Merchandize to be received
here during the present year is upwards of One Million Dollars;— and
our exports of Cotton and other produce during the same period will
greatly exceed that amount. The Extensive tracts of rich land
recently acquired from the Florida Indians and the Creek Nations in
the States of Georgia and Alabama are now rapidly settling with
interprising Citizens from the States the produce of whose industry
will add ten fold to our commerce in a few years. In conducting
this extensive business, your memorialists are dependent on private
and irrigular opportunities of sending their letters into the interior
to be Mailed for distant Cities; and it frequently happens that Wessels
with valuable Cargoes arrive in the Atlantic Ports, ten days before
the letters of advice with orders for Insurance. It has heretofore
been supposed that this Town could only be approached by water;
but from the recent report of a Surveyor of the Public Lands,-
together with an examination by private Citizens it is satisfactorily
ascertained that a good Road may be constructed from hence to
St. Andrews Bay, a distance of forty-five miles, thence to Marianna
a distance of fifty miles, where a road is already opened, but requires
repairs and the erection of a few small Bridges; The whole of which
can be done at an expence not exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars.
The opening of this road would enable the Post Master General to
furnish the Mail established by Congress two years ago between this
place and Columbus, Georgia, at comparatively little expence to the

SIR, By a recent Act of the Legislative Council of this Territory,
this place, formerly known by the name of “Mount Vernon” has been

been advised of this change, and has altered the title of the Post
Office accordingly.
The change of name was effected principally through my exertions.
The Arsenal in Alabama had the Same name, and the miscarriage of
letters &c intended for the one, but directed to the other Arsenal,
caused much delay and consequent embarrassment. An opportunity
is now afforded of giving an appropriate name to this Arsenal.

delays are highly injurious to the Territory, ruinous to the claimants
& prejudicial to the public justice of the nation—This Law agent
rides to St Augustine once or twice a year with a salary equal to the
Judge who holds six courts, & is the whole year employed, & I am
informed that last summer he went off to the Western country for six
months, neglecting entirely his public duties—The agent to be useful
must live in St Augustine—Congress have twice stricken out the
appropriation for his salary considering it a useless office, as the
duties have been performed.
I ask the favor of you to consult Gen Call who is here as to the
necessity of the Agents being in St Augustine—
If this is not done I must propose a law to abolish the office &
again strike the appropriation out of the Bill.
General Call who has been charged with this business as assistant
Counsel will be able to point out some suitable person residing in
St Augustine to prepare these cases, & bring them to an early trial
so important to the United States the Territory, and the Claimants—

RICHARD K. CALL TO DELEGATE WHITE
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:ALS]
WASHINGTON 14th March 1834
SIR. The enclosed letter will aid you in forming a correct idea how
far the sum allowed for surveying the public land, is sufficient to defray
the expense of surveying the private land claims in Florida. Four
dollars per mile is the sum allowd by law in either case. In surveying
the public land the shortest line ever run, except when the surveyor
meets with natural or artificial obstructions, is six miles. In surveying
the private claims the surveyor is compelled to pursue the calls of the
grant, in which the courses and distances are continualy changing.
Another difficulty arises from the fact, that most of the grants
made by the Spanish Government were never surveyed, and are
located in swamps and Hammocks which are almost impenetrable.
It frequently occurs that days and weeks are frequently spent, in
endeavouring to find the point of commencement, during which time
the surveyor is exposed, to fatigue and expence, without any compen-
sation whatever. In surveying the grant to Arredondo & Son the
surveyor was employed near two months in ascertaining where to
commence the survey. There are very few cases if any have occured
in Florida, in which the surveyors have not lost money, as well as
time and labour in surveying the private land claims.
Allow me to suggest as a matter of some importance to them, and
as an act of justice, that an appropriation should be made by Congress
for an additional compensation to those who have, as well as to those
who may hereafter, perform services of this kind.

D SIR About the 1st of October 1831. Col. Buttler sent us
togeather with Col. Exum to Complete the unfinished work on the
Escambia River from the Basses Paralell to the south boundary line
of the state of Alabama And alsoe to connect the surveys which
had heretofore been done by us and James R. Donelson across said
River which was attended with greate difficulty and expence—
Owing in the first place to the mistake which had been made in the
Paralell line by Crossing the Bay. And owing to the work being
almost entirily in the Escambia Swamp which was from Two to six
miles in width—and the greater part of the work was the surveying
of private claimes which caused great difficulty in the first place to
assertain whare they were located and after this was done we then
had greate difficulty in executing the work it being in the swamp
which was almost impassable—We commenced the work early in the
month of October and continued in the swamp till nearly the end of
the year with from Eighteen to twenty hands imployed and during
the whole of the time in addition to the hands and horses we had
imployed—We alsoe had to imploy the assistance of Two Boats
And when we had done the work as nearly as it was practable we
returned to the office about the 1" of January 1832 for the purpose
of making out our returns of the work which we had done and during
the prosicution of which it was nessary for one of us to return to the
Escambia twice for the purpose of correcting work which it was not
known was nessary untill it was assertained by examinning the
office—About the 15" of May. we made a finish of our returns to
the office–And as a compensation for our work we received each
about four hundred and forty dollars which left us in debt. after
doing the work for nothing (and undergowing the maney privations
which we underwent) about thirteen hundred dollars each—You will
now sir while at Washington this winter apply at the Commissioners
office and see the returns of Col: Buttlers office whare you will see
the whole matter better then it can now be exsplained,

WASHINGTON March 21st 1834
SIR, I understand that Govenor Duval proposes to leave his
office, & official duties in Florida, & is desirous of effecting it, under
the express in implied sanction of the President, or of your Depart-
ment—
As the Representative of the people of Florida I beg leave most
respectfully to submit to the consideration of the President, one or
two observations—
Govenor Duval procured his confirmation in the Senate by a
positive pledge to those who did not intend to vote for him, without an
examination into serious charges that he would resign, & by various
other political pledges & promises which I need not enumerate *-
Phagan who has since forged the papers to defraud the Gover-
ment * was his intimate frend, and principal witness—
The nomination was confirmed, & he did not resign—Since that
time he has made the office a sinecure—He was for seven or eight
months before December last actually living in Kentucky—His
Secretary acting as Govenor, & there are now here claims on the
Govrment, & before Congress for clerk hire, because the Secretary
was Govenor, & there was no Secretary—”
To avoid the adium of again leaving his Post and abandoning his
public duties he wishes to put it upon the Govrment here, and get
his expences paid out of the Territory—If the President will stop his
salary during his absence I will venture to say he will not go-

WASHINGTON March 21*1834
SIR, I have the honor to enclose you a letter, or rather an extract
from a letter of the Judge of East Florida—You will perceive that the
difficulty suggested by the Judge arises from the fact that the Law
agent lives 200 or 250 miles from where the court sits, & only rides
once or twice a year to that place at the Regular terms—The testi-
mony not having been collected in vacation the term of the court is
greatly protracted at an immense expence to the govement—
The expence of this court as now conducted for this land adjudi-
cation is more than ten thousand dollars a year, & if it is to be con-
tinued ten years the accommodation of Mr Allen will cost the Gove-
ment $100,000—The truth is that this whole business might & ought
to have been finished in two years, & now with an active law agent
residing at St Augustine it might be concluded in one year—This
delay is injurious to the Govement, unjust to individuals, and highly
injurious to the Territory of Florida *—
There will be an effort made to strike out your appropriation, & a
serious attack on the Department—
I hope I shall have it in my power to say that these abuses have
been rectified—
I understand that General Call recommended Charles Downing
* In his message to the Legislative Council, Jan. 25, 1834, DuVal expressed
himself in favor of the election of the governor by the people of the territory
(Fla., Terr. Legis. Council, Journal, 1834, p. 37). A select committee of the
council reported favorably on this proposition on Feb. 14 (ibid., pp. 120-121).
The Legislative Council committee on the state of the territory reported on
Feb. 13, 1834, in favor of a vote by the people on the question of establishing a
state government (ibid., pp. 106–109).

Surveyor's Office TALLAHASSEE March 29* 1834.
SIR, As instructed in your letter of the 30" Dec’ last” I was about
preparing instruction for the execution of the survey of the Town of
S” Augustine, a practised and skilful Surveyor having been designated
to perform that duty, and who in the execution of other Surveys
near that place, took occassion, in anticipation of his instructions, to
converse with the inhabitants and probably the authorities on the
subject, and wrote to me on the 24" Ult. from which the following
is an extract.
“We expect your instructions about the Survey of this Town or
fear we will receive them, We have been informed, and no doubt
Correctly too that not more than the One half of the Claimants to
lots in this place have ever presented their titles papers to the Com-
missioners for Confirmation. M' Downing (who was one of the late
Commissioners) told us to day, that that was the case, and owing to
these facts we do not see how we could survey the Town without a
conversation with you on the subject or some latitude given in your
instructions”
The only mode of Survey, must be predicated upon the Concession
of the Board of Commissioners, and their adjudication having been
but partial it will readily occur to you, that a survey executed under
such circumstances would be imperfect in the extreme; as I cannot
permit (or sanction afterwards) any surveys which might be executed,
not warranted by the legal authorities of the general government—
Under this view of the Subject I have thought it expedient to delay
the Survey of St Augustine until I shall receive further instructions
from you, and have notified the Surveyor thereof.
I have felt much anxiety of mind from not receiving any acknowledg-
ment of the large and important returns made to your Office since my
arrival from the West—I sincerely hope they may have safely arrived
Expecting the return of the Deputies (in all this month) who have
been engaged for some months past and wishing to meet their absolute
wants in due time after their returns shall be received and adjudicated,

ists) who has examined the said Fort Marion, is satisfied with its
construction, and is desirous that it may be preserved in its primitive
condition (exclusive of the wood work, which may at any time be
replaced) for the purposes of continuing an ancient Fort which will
for centuries be useful as a monument of Spanish operations, and as a
place of deposite for Naval and Military Stores, of this portion of the
Atlantic Coast. We would therefore respectfully pray that an
appropriation, based upon said plan and estimates, may be made, that
the work, now but partially executed, may be continued to its final
completion; and as in duty bound, &c.

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF APALACHICOLA
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[April 7, 1834]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in
Congress assembled.
We the undersigned, Citizens of the Town of Apalachicola, in the
Western Judicial District of Florida, Respectfully shew,
1* That we have sustained great loss and inconvenience, for
the want of a Superior Court possessing proper jurisdiction.
2" That the Judge of this District resides in Pensacola, which,
by the route usually travelled, is four hundred miles distant from
this place.
3* That said Judge is required, by law, to hold a Court here
twice in each year; but that no Court has been held by him here for
more than twelve months, and that the next regular term of said
Court is now eight months distant.
4* That there are engaged in the trade of this place a number
of Steam-Boats, besides many Ships, Brigs, and other vessels arriving
and departing with valuable cargoes, creating a commerce that is
already extensive, and is rapidly increasing.
5* That such commercial intercourse gives rise to many cases
involving large and important interests, and often requiring the
immediate action of a Judge exercising Common Law, Chancery,
and Maritime Jurisdiction.
Believing, therefore, that we shall continue to suffer great and
increasing loss and inconvenience, under our present Judiciary System,
and that the commerce and business of this place entitle us to the
consideration of Congress, we Respectfully pray, that Congress will
immediately establish for us a separate Judicial District, giving to
the Judgethereof the powers now exercised by other Judges of Superior
Courts in Florida, and requiring him to reside at or near this place;
thereby affording us that certain and prompt administration of

withdrew the former nominations and made the new ones; Walker was confirmed
on Apr. 7, 1834, the appointment to be effective on Mar. 25 when Westcott's
commission expired (Senate, Exec. Journal, IV, 380, 382).

SIR. The Merchants and Citizens of this place having applied to
Congress for the establishment of a separate judicial District to
include the County of Franklin alone * (the cause of which arrises
from the geographical situation of Appalachicola, to and from which
the intercourse is irregular and uncertain, and the Judge having the
Choice of a more healthy situation, by the addition, or connection
with other counties, would reside at such place as would destroy his
usefulness here) and as the Officer of the Port for the collection of the
Revenue I feel it my duty to request your favourable consideration
of, and influence in effecting this object
The importance of the Port to the Goverment cannot have escaped
your observation, it would therefore be unnecessary on my part to
enter fully in detail upon this subject, indeed I deem it sufficient to
assure you that the commerce of the Port, of Exports and Imports
(coastwise principally) are but little short of Five millions of dollars
for the current year, and according to fair estimates will nearley
double that sum for the current year of 1835—added to which, active

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS FROM THE EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE OF TRUSTEES OF PENSACOLA COLLEGE
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[April 23, 1834]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the United
States.
The Memorial of the undersigned, the Executive Committee of
the Trustees of the Pensacola College, most respectfully represents,
That at the last Session of the Legislative Council of the Territory
of Florida, an act was passed incorporating the Trustees of a College,
to be located in the City of Pensacola, with power in them to confer
Degrees and Diplomas in the sciences, and with the common corporate
rights and privileges—
Your Memorialists respectfully represent to your Honorable Bodies
that in this act the Legislative Council was governed no less by the
wishes of the Citizens of West Florida, than by the peculiar fitness
which the City of Pensacola possesses for a Literary Institution-
This peculiar fitness is obvious to all who have any correct knowledge
of Pensacola, and to bring it to the notice of your Honorable Bodies,
your Memorialists would represent; That the City of Pensacola
stands upon the Bay of the same name, a short distance from the
Navy Yard of the United States, the Fortifications, Hospital &c:
it is blessed with a most abundant supply of the purest and finest
water—with a mild and healthy climate, and with an exemption from
those fevers and other diseases, whose ravages have often been so very
much felt in most of our other sea-port Towns; it is accessible either
by land or by water at all points, as well for the Citizens of Florida as
for those of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia; its in-

habitants are sober, moral and industrious. Pensacola is now the
most interesting portion of The Territory of the United States on the
Gulf of Mexico, arising from its being the Rendezvous of the West
India Squadron and in the immediate vicinity of a Navy Yard,
Hospital, Forts and other public works belonging to the United States,
and necessarily the resort of many intelligent officers and others:
every circumstance indicates that it is destined to become the most
commercially important in the South West portion of the United
States. Its harbour is one of the finest that can be imagined: easy
of access—safe—capacious. The extensive Bay on which it stands,
can with a very small expense, be made to communicate on the west
with the Bay of Perdido, thence with the Lake Borgne, and the
River Mississippi: on the north, the River Escambia one of the
Tributaries of Pensacola Bay, is navigable and extends far into the
interior of Alabama: on the East, the sound of Santa Rosa connects
the Bay of Pensacola with that of Choctaw hatchie, and invites an
internal communication with St Andrews, St Joseph and Apalachicola
Bays, and thence with the Atlantic: on the south the entrance into
the Gulf of Mexico is over the safest and deepest bar on the Gulf.
A Rail Road to connect Columbus in Georgia, with Pensacola, is in
agitation, and for this purpose the Legislative Council of Florida have
incorporated a Company. Should this work ever be perfected (and
there is every reasonable prospect that it will be in a very few years)
the entire commerce of a large wealthy and populous portion of
Georgia as well as of Alabama will flow through Pensacola: intimate
associations and relations will grow up between those respective por-
tions of our Common country, and the interests of the one will become
identified with the interests of the other.
Wherefore your Memorialists would respectfully represent to your
Honorable Bodies, that Pensacola from its location—its vicinity to
public works of the United States—the salubrity of its climate—
its exemption from disease—its abundance of wholesome and fine
water—its facility of access—its prospective commercial importance—
and the character of its citizens—is peculiarly fitted for an extensive
Literary Institution—such an one as would supply the Literary wants
of all that extensive Southern and South Western country, which
blessed with superior fertility of soil, enjoys a less salubrious climate
than has fallen to the happy lot of Pensacola.
The importance and utility of such an institution are obvious;
its benefits are apparent to all. With your Memorialists the only
difficulty is, how shall it be endowed and sustained?—and yet—even
this difficulty looses all its force and dissolves itself into mere solici-
tude, when we reflect under what kind of Government we happily
live, and to whom we have the honor to address ourselves. We live

under a Government whose stability rests upon the virtue and Intel-
ligence of its Citizens: We have the honor to address Those to whom
the people have delegated the power of watching over their rights
and of making laws for their preservation—Your Memorialists rest
with entire confidence upon the disposition of your Honorable Bodies
to do every thing, within the compass of your legitimate powers,
for the advancement of improvement literary, social and political
among the Citizens of this widely extended empire: they look to you,
without a doubt of your willingless to assist every project which
has for its object the amelioration of the Condition of your fellow
Citizens. Without your generous assistance, they despair of carrying
into effect the present object, which addresses itself so forcibly to the
best judgment, to the fondest hopes and to the most refined feelings
of your Memorialists—Living in a Territory as yet with a sparse
population and with little wealth, although in one, which promises,
at no very distant day, to be one of the brightest stars in the Constel-
lation of the American Union, your memorialists candidly admit, that
the means of putting the institution committed to their charge, into
operation are beyond their reach or the ability of the Territory: They
therefore naturally turn their eyes towards Congress—a Body from
whose beneficence immense benefits have been already dispensed to
Florida.
Your Memorialists therefore respectfully solicit from Congress a
Grant to the Trustees of the Pensacola College, and for its benefit,
of the whole or a portion of the Township of Land heretofore set
apart by Congress for the use of a College in the District of West
Florida, and also a Grant for such lands belonging to the United
States, either in Florida or elsewhere, as shall be sufficient to create
a fund for the founding of their College: as also the right and title of
the United States to such Lots, water Lots and water privileges in
the City of Pensacola, as have not been asked for by the Trustees of
the Pensacola Academy; and also a Grant for the site of the old Forts
near Pensacola for the erection of the College Buildings with such a
quantity of public Land adjoining from one to two hundred acres,
as will suffice for all the necessary out buildings, offices, Gardens &c.;
and also for a Grant of the Cantonment as a place of temporary
accommodation for the Students and Professors, as soon as it shall
cease to be occupied by the United States Troops

the Survey of the City of St. Augustine, the lines of the several
Streets forming the boundaries of the different Squares, are to be first

* In reply, Apr. 22, the Chief Engineer referred White to his last report to
Congress (NA, WD, CE, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 9). The report, Nov. 23, 1833,
stated that to undertake the improvement would have required the purchase
of a steam dredging machine, which would have nearly exhausted the appro-
priation; consequently it had been decided to wait until the boats employed at
Savannah or St. Marks became available (NA, WD, CE, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 9;
Exec. Doc. 1, 23 Cong., 1 sess., p. 56). The report also presents information

not been acted upon by the Commissioners, it is entirely owing to
the neglect of those claimants, and the greatest extent to which we
can now go to protect their interests from the effects of their own in-
attention, will be for you to direct the Deputy making the Survey,
to note the Supposed limits of all such claims as he may have good
and sufficient reasons to believe are private property, although he
must be positively prohibited from making any actual survey of the
boundaries of such alleged claims.
When the Survey is returned to your Office you will forward to me
a Separate plat of each Square, exhibiting, on a convenient Scale, the
dimensions and contents in feet, English measure, of each lot or tract
actually Surveyed, with the proper references to the confirmation in
each case; and designating by dotted lines those lots which are claimed,
but not confirmed, with the names of the present and original claim-
ants thereof, So far as the Deputy may have been enabled to ascertain
them. These plats of Squares are to be accompanied by a general
plat of the Survey of the City.
The returns alluded to in your letter were duly received, but under
the great press of business now requiring the immediate attention of
this Office it has been found impracticable to give them an examina-
tion.
I have this day requested the Secretary of the Treasury to remit you
the Sum of $10,000 on account of Surveying the public lands, that
Sum being the largest amount which can now be transmitted to you,
in consequence of the appropriation Bill not having passed Congress.

INDEX NOTE
In compiling the list of names of persons for this index, deficiencies in spelling
found in the text have been corrected, in so far as sources now available permit,
and variants found throughout the text have been assembled in parentheses. The
nearly illegible character of the handwriting in some instances, which leaves the
reader in doubt as to the writer's intent, and the obvious ignorance, or careless-
ness, often displayed by the signatories account for many variations in orthog-
raphy. With respect to the signers of petitions, like names, with identical spell-
ing, are also frequently attached to successive documents on related subjects from
the same locality; yet a comparison of the handwriting discloses occasional impor-
tant differences. In such instances separate entries have been made in the index,
though the reader is warned that names were often written in by hands other than
the subscribers’; finality in this regard cannot therefore be established in every
case. On the other hand the fact that the same name is variously spelled in
sequential documents does not argue against identity of person, which is likewise
disclosed by a comparison of handwriting as well as by such other tests as docu-
ments of legal record, genealogical data, and whatever knowledge of the various
residences of a given person may be derived from the papers embodied in the
present volume. But whenever there is doubt as to such identity a separate
entry has been made. In some instances the index material is organized according
to office or function under a duplication of the principal entry (see DuVal, Wil-
