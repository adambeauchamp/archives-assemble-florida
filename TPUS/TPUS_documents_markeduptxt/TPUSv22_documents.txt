<docbody>DEAR SIR I this day had the honor of transmitting to the President, the names of several persons" who are Candidates for office in Florida—Among the rest, were two of my particular friends—George
<pb#25 />
Walton and Jesiah Sturges Beers" of Augusta—As you will no doubt have much to do, with the organization of the contemplated Government—I trust you will excuse me, for calling your attention to the names before mentioned. Col° George Walton," the person first named, is the only son of the late George Walton, of Georgia, one of the patriots of the revolution, and one of those worthies who signed the declaration of Independence—But Col° Waltons claims are not alone those of inheritance— he is a gentleman of liberal education and of great respectibility—And aspires to the office of Secretary of State—for which appointment I think him well qualified. Mr Beers the other person mentioned is a gentleman of industry, integrity &
ability and well qualified to fill the office of Post Master at Augustine—the appointment solicited for him.
If there should not be other Candidates for these offices—having higher claims to your consideration—I should feel much gratified by their receiving your approbation.
I have the honor to be with very great respect Y Ob*S*

I am well acquainted with the Gentlemen recommended in the foregoing letter, & it affords me pleasure to say, that they are persons of the highest respectability & every way qualified to discharge the duties of the offices they desire to obtain.

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, 12 March 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>MAJOR GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON.
SIR, By direction of the President of the United States, I have the honor of transmitting to you three Commissions, 1.-As Commissioner to receive possession of the Provinces of East and West Florida, conformably to the Treaty between the United States and Spain, concluded on the 22" of February 1819.”
2. As Governor of the whole Territories of which possession is to be thus taken.”
3. As Commissioner” vested with Special and extraordinary powers,” conformably to the stipulations of the Treaty and to the Act of Congress for carrying the same into execution; copies of both which are also among the enclosures with this letter.
Together with the Spanish Ratification of the Treaty, there was transmitted to the Spanish Minister at this place a Royal Order, to the Captain General and Governor of the Island of Cuba,” for delivering possession of the Provinces of East and West Florida, according to the Stipulations of the second article of the Treaty.
Colonel James G. Forbes has been appointed by the President Agent & Commissary to deliver this Royal Order to the Governor of Cuba,” to concert and arrange with him the execution of it, and to receive any documents or archives which may be at the Havanna, and which are stipulated to be delivered by this article. A copy of his Instructions is herewith enclosed; " by which you will perceive, that he is to deliver over to you all such documents or archives as he may receive at the Havanna. It is desirable that those relating to
<pb#34 />
each of the two Provinces should be kept distinct from each other, and that this Government should be informed generally of their character and quantity.
Colonel Forbes is to take passage at New York, in the United States Sloop of War Hornet, Captain Read;" and, on arriving at Pensacola, is to give you immediate notice, that you may repair thither to receive possession of that place. The Hornet is to remain there to escort the transports, in which the Spanish officers and troops, and their baggage, are to be conveyed to the Havanna. The Spanish Minister has expressed a strong wish, that no troops of the United States may be introduced into Pensacola or St. Augustine, until after the evacuation by those of Spain. The object of this request being to avoid any possible unpleasant altercations between the soldiers of the two nations, the President thinks it reasonable to comply with it, unless you should be of opinion that it will be attended with inconvenience. In that event, he relies that you will take every measure of precaution which may be necessary to guard against any such collisions between the soldiers; and he trusts with confidence that in every arrangement for the evacuation, the utmost delicacy will be observed to avoid every thing which might tend to wound the feelings of any of the Spanish officers, soldiers, or subjects, who are to remove.
It is the President's desire, that you should appoint General Gaines,”
or such other Officer as you may deem expedient, to receive possession of St. Augustine; and that the same Instructions should be applied to the execution of that Service. The United States' Brig Enterprize, or Sch. Porpoise, will be ordered to proceed to that place, to escort the transports which are to convey the Spanish officers and troops thence to the Havanna. The care of providing the transports at both places is referred to you. The number of troops at either place is not known, but supposed to amount to about 500 men at each. The stipulation is understood to include civil as well as military officers, and provisions as well as passage: Instructions will be given by the Secretary of War to the Quarter-Masters * and Commissaries to furnish to your orders provisions and transports for the conveyance of the Spanish officers and troops. It is expected they will be supplied
<pb#35 />
at New Orleans and Mobile, for those to embark within the Gulph, and at Savannah and Charleston for those going from St. Augustine.
A copy and translation of the Royal Order to the Governor of Cuba, for delivering the possession of the Provinces, are among the enclosures herewith. You will observe, that it includes expressly the islands appertinent to them. It will be proper that attention should be paid to taking possession of all these islands; but it may not be necessary that a formal delivery of them in every case should be made.
On receiving from the Governors of West and East Florida possession of those respective Provinces, it will be proper to exchange certificates of the time and mode of the transaction: orders for the delivery of any military posts within the Provinces will be expected, and they will be occupied by detachments of our troops as you may deem expedient.
As soon as the possession shall be transferred, you will, in pursuance of your authority over the ceded territories, issue proclamations announcing the fact. A form,” adopted from that which was issued on the first occupation of Louisiana," is herewith enclosed, to be modified as the circumstances in your opinion may require.
The powers, vested in you by the enclosed Commissions, are also conformable to those which were entrusted to the Governor of Louisiana," under an Act of Congress of similar import." The President is satisfied that they will be exercised by you with a due regard as well to the privileges and usages of the inhabitants under the Government to which they have been subject, as to the personal and social rights to which they will be entitled by the stipulations of the Treaty, and as associates to the Union of these States. The money paid into the Spanish treasury before the delivery of possession, and whatever may be due thereto at that date, is to be considered as the property of Spain. Payments and debts subsequent to that date, will belong of course to the United States.
The laws of the United States relating to the revenue and its collection, and those relating to the introduction of persons of color, being extended, by the Act of Congress, to the Territory," the execution of them will be superintended by officers to be appointed for the several collection districts to be established by the President conformably to the law.
<pb#36 />
Your compensation as Governor will be at the rate of five thousand dollars a year. As Commissioner for receiving possession of the Provinces,” such reasonable expenses as may be incurred will be allowed. Whenever your military command ceases, your salary as Governor will commence.
In the taking of possession of St. Augustine and East-Florida, similar proceedings to those relative to the occupation of West-Florida will be proper. Both Provinces being placed under your direction, the Proclamation to be issued there will be in your name; and General Gaines, or such other officer as you may appoint, will be instructed to consider himself, for all the purposes of the Government, subject to your orders.
At the ensuing session of Congress, it is to be presumed one of the earliest objects of attention to that body will be, to make further provision for the Government of these territories.” The President wishes you, in the interval, to collect and communicate to this Department any information, relating to the country and its inhabitants, which may be useful to the exercise of the legislative authority of the Union concerning them.
For the expenses incident to the services herewith required, you will draw upon this Department. Strict economy is to be observed in incurring them; and I have urgently to request the transmission, as early as possible, of all the accounts resulting from them with the vouchers necessary for their settlement at the Treasury."
I am with great respect, Sir, your very humble and obed" Serv"

<place-time>ALBANY March 12* 1821</place-time>
<docbody>SIR A number of the most respectable members of both houses of our state legislature having lately joined in recommending M"
Rodman * of New York to the President as a candidate for a collectorship or other public office in Florida, I take the liberty to lay before the government some more particular information respecting this gentleman. M Rodman was bred a merchant and is generally admitted to be an excellent accountant and man of business. Various circumstances afterwards led him to the study and profession of the law in which he acquired a respectable standing and held for some time the lucrative and honourable place of District Attorney for the city of New York.
Some important business (in the result of which however he was unfortunately disappointed) induced him to resign this office and go to Europe. Being now a widower, having not yet recovered his professional business, and believing that a southern climate would be favorable to his general health he is now induced to try his fortunes in Florida.
He has paid great attention to modern languages and the civil and continental law. He writes and speaks French with much accuracy and fluency and is generally acquainted with the modes of transacting both public and commercial business on the continent of Europe.
He is besides a man of fair character and of indefatigable industry.
Should the collectorships, for which I understand that he applies, be otherwise bestowed, M. R. is well qualified for several others of the offices which will be probably erected under the territorial government.
I am with great respect Your obedient Servant GULIAN C. VERPLANCK

Whereas by An Act of Congress passed on the third day of the present month entitled “An Act for carrying into execution the Treaty between the United States and Spain, concluded at Washington, on the twenty second day of February, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen,”" it is provided that until the end of the first Session of the next Congress, unless provision be sooner made for the temporary Government of the Territories ceded by Spain to the United States by the Treaty concluded at Washington on the twenty second day of February, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen between the two Nations, all the Military Civil and judicial powers exercised by the Officers of the existing Government of the same shall be vested in such person or persons, and shall be exercised in such manner as the President of the United States shall direct, for maintaining the Inhabitants of said Territories in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion: and Whereas on the tenth day of the present month, I did by letters patent under the Seal of the United States in pursuance of the powers vested in me as aforesaid appoint you the said ANDREW JACKSON to exercise under certain limitations within the said ceded Territories all the powers and authorities heretofore exercised by the Governor and Captain General and by the Intendant of Cuba, and by the Governors of East and West Florida within the said Provinces respectively, with the clauses and conditions in the said Letters patent expressed: * and Whereas it appears to me expedient that you should be vested with the other powers hereinafter specified: Therefore be it known that in virtue of the above recited Act of Congress I do by these presents appoint and authorize you the said ANDREW JACKSON to administer the Government with the existing authorities in the best manner in your power, for the present, and to report without delay, the actual State, with such alterations as you may think adviseable, that further instructions may be given respecting the same: and I do moreover authorize you to suspend any officer or officers in the said Territories which the public good

<docbody>SIR, To execute the instructions, which you have received through the Department of State to take possession of East and West Florida,"
you will proceed with as little delay as may be practicable to the Cantonment of Montpelier, where as has been Communicated to you in your instructions, you will receive notice of the Arrival of Col Forbes at Pensacola.”
The Deputy Quarter Master MajStanton has been ordered to the same place, who will receive and execute your Commands, as connected with the Quarter Masters Department, and the enclosed Copies of orders from that, and the Commissarys departments will inform you of the arrangement which has been made as to transports and provi-
<pb#40 />
sions. Major Cross "will be ordered * to Amelia Island,” to Superintend the arrangements in that quarter, and I trust that on your arrival at the Cantonment, you will find these arrangements so far matured, that you will be ready to take possession in a very short period should the Spanish authorities be prepared to give it. It was deemed advisable to issue the orders here to avoid any possible delay.
General Gaines has been ordered to this place, where he will be by the 10" of next month, to aid with his advise and information in the reduction of the Army; and it is doubtful whether he will return to his Head Quarters in time to take possession of S*Augustine, should you, in the exercise of your powers select him for that purpose; and I would therefore suggest, in that event, that you should at the same time give provisional power to some other Officer to act in his place, should he be absent.
The 4" Regiment of Infantry, and the Company of Artillery at Mobile will occupy Pensacola, and the Barrancas; the Garrison of Fort Gadsden,” which will be evacuated, will occupy St Marks," and the two Companies of Artillery sent from Boston to Amelia Island, St Augustine. They will be governed in their movements for that purpose by your orders. The Companies ordered to Amelia Island and the provisions which has been ordered by the Commissary General to that place for the transportation of the Spanish Garrison at S*
Augustine to the Havannah, will go in the transports to S*Augustine.
<pb#41 />
Your Command as Maj General will not, under the Act of Congress of the 2" inst: * reducing the Army terminate, till the 1* of June next, to which period your pay in that Capacity will continue.

<docbody>MAJ T. CROSS Washington City SIR. The treaty with Spain provides that the Spanish troops stationed in Florida be transported to Havanna at the expense of the United States S*Augustine will be occupied by three companies of Artillery from Boston, and Cap" Bender has been instructed" to engage the vessels which may be employed in transporting them to their destination, to proceed afterwards to Havanna with the Spanish troops. To prevent delay or difficulty, however, it is proper that an officer be on the spot with full powers to act under all circumstances—
You have been selected for this service, and will, accordingly, proceed to Fernandina, Amelia Island, and adopt such measures both in regard to the American & Spanish Troops as in your judgement may be proper.
Arrangements have been made by the Subsistence department to supply the Spanish troops with provisions for the voyage.

<docbody>MAJOR GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON. Nashville.
SIR, By the second article of the Florida Treaty, it is stipulated that with the Territories of East and West Florida, the fortifications within the same, are ceded and to be delivered to the United States; but no express mention is made of the Cannon, belonging to them.
By the seventh Article of the same Treaty, it is provided that the United States shall furnish the transports and escort necessary to convey the Spanish Officers and troops, and their baggage to the Havanna—But no mention is made of the transportation of Cannon;
nor is there any express engagement on the part of the United States, to furnish provisions to the Spanish Officers and Troops on the passage.
It is the opinion of the President, that by a fair and just construction of the Treaty, the Cannon belonging to the fortifications are to be considered as appendages to them, included in the Cession, and are therefore to be left with them.
On the same principle he is of opinion, that with the transports and escort to convey the Spanish Officers and troops and their baggage, the provisions necessary for the passage, are also to be furnished at the expence of the United States, although not specially mentioned in the Treaty; and orders have accordingly been given for the supply of provisions.
It is however possible that the Spanish Governors of East and West Florida, may upon a different construction of the Treaty, claim to carry away the Cannon from the fortifications, because they are not expressly named in the Article.
You will in that case claim that they should be left with the fortifications, and insist that upon the principle of the other Construction the United States are not bound to furnish provisions for the passage of the Officers and troops—You will state that the supply has been ordered in the Confidence, that the benefit of the same liberal Construction of the Treaty will operate in favour of the United States;
and that if it be not extended to them, they will have a just claim to be reimbursed for the expence of supplying the provisons.
<pb#44 />
You will add that as there is no engagement on their part express or implied, to furnish the means of transporting the Cannon, they have made and can make no provision for that purpose.
Should the Spanish Governors alledge that their orders are express, for having the Cannon carried away, you will leave it to them to make provision for their transportation, and report forthwith the facts to this Department.”
I am, with great Respect, Sir, your very humble and Obed" Serv"

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 31* March, 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Mr J. A. Penieres has been appointed by the President sub-agent to the Indians in Florida and placed under your superintendence as Governor of Florida. I enclose for your information a copy of the instructions to him.”
He is a gentleman eminent for his various acquirements, who being forced from France for political reasons has selected this country for his residence, and who, in order to become intimately acquainted with the Indian character has resided several years among the Indians in the Arkansas Territory.” The knowledge which Mr Penieres has thus acquired of their Character, his familiar acquaintance with the Spanish language, and his talents and acquirements will, it is believed, make him very useful. The fact of his being a Frenchman will, it is thought, in no degree disqualify him for the duties assigned to him; on the contrary, the Indians have ever shown to the French a strong attachment, and it may be considered as favorable to the successful discharge of his duties.
You will give M* Penieres such additional instructions as you may deem proper. In the selection of an Interpreter, which is of considerable importance, you will probably be able to give him such information as may be very useful.
We have not yet made formal peace with the Seminoles. Should you deem it necessary for that purpose, or to impress them more solemnly with the new relation in which they stand to us, you are authorized to appoint a special Commissioner, to whom you may allow a suitable compensation, for the purpose, thro' whom you may make such communication as you may judge the state of the Case to require. In the first pressure of emigration and the uncertain extent of the portion of Florida which may be claimed by the Indians, it is to be feared that some collision may take place between them and our citizens; to avoid which it would seem to be advisable to ascertain from the Spanish authority, as well as the Indians themselves, the extent and limits of the country to which they have a just claim, and to give such information for the guidance of persons who may wish to emigrate or explore the country as you may think proper-
<pb#46 />
The President reposing every confidence in your discretion and judgement, does not think it necessary to give more minute or full instructions, as he doubts not that, in the discharge of your duty, the measures the best calculated to promote the public interest will be adopted by you.”
I have the honor to be, Your Obed" Serv"

<docbody>MR. J. A. PENIERES, Sub Agent to the Indians in Florida SIR, I enclose you an appointment by the President of Sub-Agent to the Indians residing in the Floridas and you will be placed under the superintendence of General Jackson the Gov' of Florida through whom you will communicate with this Dep" and under whose immediate orders you will act.
Your compensation will be at the rate of $500 per year; but as your duties previous to your permanent location will involve you in very considerable expense, your extra expense provided it does not with your pay as Agent exceed $1200 per year will be allowed. You will be allowed an interpreter whose compensation will be at the rate of $400 but as no person suitable to discharge the duties of this office is known to the Department the appointment will be postponed till a proper selection can be made. In the mean time you are authorized with the assent of the Superintendent to employ a person to act as interpretor at the rate above stated till one can be appointed by the Department. The person whom you may so appoint you will through the Superintendent report to this Dept and also state whether he possesses the necessary qualifications for the permanent discharge of the duties of an interpretor. Your salary with personal expenses in the discharge of your duty, the salary of the Interpretor and such contingent expenses as may be attendant on your intercourse with the Tribes, such as small presents, provisions &c, will be remitted to you quarterly on your estimates transmitted to this Dep" through the superintendent and approved by him.
Your general duty will be indicated by the act of Congress regu-
<pb#47 />
lating intercourse with the Indian Tribes” of which a copy is enclosed; but the recent acquisition of Florida and the new relation which has in consequence been created between the United States and the Indians residing within its limits, will impose on you new and peculiar duties.
It is important that the Government should know as early as practicable the number of Indians residing in Florida, their various Tribes, the country occupied by them and their disposition towards the U. States. To obtain this knowledge you will visit the various portions of the Country inhabited by Indians; and take the necessary measures to obtain the information required, as accurately as may be practicable which you will without delay report through the Superintendent to this Department. You will ascertain not only the portion of the country which they may actually inhabit but also the extent claimed by them; and the extent of cessions which at various times may have been made by them to the Spanish or the English Governments. In the performance of this duty you will visit the greater portion of the Territory and you will avail yourself of the opportunity which it will afford to become acquainted with the character of the country including its Geography, Geology, climate, soil, & face of the country & its productions animal, vegitable & Mineral, all of which you will accarately notice and report as above directed, accompanied by such observations and reflections as you may think proper.
You will make the Indians acquainted with their new relations to the U. States and impress on them an assurance of being protected provided they demean themselves peaceably. Situated as they are and surrounded as they must in a short time be with the white population, it will probably become desirable both to them and us to make hereafter a new Disposition of them either by concentrating them at some one point in Florida, or by giving them a new home in some other part of the U. States. You will sound them on this point when your residence among them has been sufficiently long to enable you to do it with prudence. Gen' Jackson has been authorized should he deem it adviseable, to appoint a special commissioner to accompany you to the Seminole Indians in order to make such representation and immediate arrangements with them as he may judge necessary.
The duties which are assigned to you are important and the Pres'
confides in your industry, zeal and ability for their faithful discharge.
Further instructions will hereafter be given you growing out of the information which may be received.
I have &c, J. C. C

In pursuance of the instructions of the President as communicated thro' you, I shall proceed as soon as practicable to Montpelier (via)
New Orleans, there to await the necessary information from Col:
Forbes, and shall immediately upon receiving it, take possession of Pensacola and proceed to organize the Government agreeably to the Instructions—I hope to be able to leave this by the 15* Inst: and to arrive at Montpelier by the 1* May.
I have agreeably to instructions” appointed Brevet Major Genl.
Gaines to receive possession of St. Augustine and by the Southern Mail have forwarded him the necessary instructions for that purpose.
<pb#49 />
There is one subject, which at this early period, I wish thro you, to call the attention of the President to, & receive your instructions thereon—It is the situation of that part of the Creek Indians who in the late war abandoned their own Country and fled to the Floridas and continued hostilities against the United States, until conquered in 1818. During that campaign I ordered the conquered Indians above the Florida line, and directed them to settle down within their own limits (the Creek Nation) I have lately however understood that M° Queen and his adherrents have made a settlement at Mickasuckey and also on the Suwaney river.—Are these Indians to be ordered up to the Creek Country, there to settle themselves, or are they to be protected in their new settlement? I have only to remark that the Country set apart for the Creek Nation is sufficient for the support of all, & that by removing those within Florida greater security will be given to our frontier, and the Government would more certainly be enabled to prevent smuggleing, which no doubt will be attempted to a considerable extent thro the various inlets in the Country now inhabited by them. Whatever may be the Presidents Instructions upon this subject shall be strictly obeyed and likewise in relation to the negroes who have run away from the States & inhabit this country and are protected by the Indians.”

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 23" ult” * and have perused with Attention the instructions contained therein, The Second Article of the Treaty in
<pb#51 />
which it is stipulated that the Teritories of East and West Floridas and the fortifications within the same are ceeded and are to be delivered to the United States is so clear and explicit that it had never occurr'd to my mind that an attempt would be made by the Spanish Authorities to strip the Fortifications of their means of defence.
Cannon is an indispensable appendage of a Fortification, and the term Fortification is always understood to include every think appertaining to a work Constructed for defence, Indeed Such was my view of That Article of the Treaty, That I should have Considered the Spanish Government bound by their Cession of the fortifications with the teritory, to pass over to the United States not only the fortifications, but the Ordnance and Munitions of war Contained therein, If on my arrival at Pensacola any dificulty should arise on this Subject—I will avail myself of your very Just Suggestions, And will endeavour—as forcibly as I can to impress the Governor with a Sense of the liberal Construction which the United States are disposed to give to the treaty In any event you may rest assured that your instructions will be most promptly attended to,"

<docbody>SIR, Inclosed you will receive a provisional commission to receive possession of St. Augustine and its dependencies, in the absence of Bret: Major Gen' E. P. Gaines, who I had on the 2" Inst: commissioned for that purpose,” but a letter from the Sec of War of the 22"
Ult, advises,” that he has been ordered to the City of Washington, to aid in the organization of the Army agreeably to the act of Congress for its reduction.
<pb#53 />
You will therefore proceed forthwith to Amelia Island, and there make the necessary arrangements, for receiving and occupying that part of the Country ceded to us from Spain, towit, St. Augustine and its dependencies, attending to the instructions herewith enclosed, viz. from the Sec of State N° 1." Copy of the royal order for the delivery of the Florida's N° 2." Copy of a letter from the Secy of of State to Co': Forbes N° 3." Copy of a Communication from the Sec of War with accompanying Documents N° 4'—You will find from the instructions that I am authorized to draw upon the Department of State for all necessary expences that may accrue in receiving possession and organizing the Government of the Florida's—you will therefore furnish me with the accounts as early as possible that they may be forwarded to that Department for settlement.
You are authorized to draw upon me for the necessary funds for the above purpose.
You will perceive from the letter of the 22" ult: enclosed from the Sec of War that the Garrison of Fort Gadsden is to occupy St.
Marks—I had ordered Gen' Gaines some time since, to have this Garrison relieved, whether he has done so, or not, I am not advised—
Major Fanning * has remonstrated often, on the hardship of being continued there; this I have made known to the Department, but as the Sec’ requires the Garrison of Fort Gadsden to occupy that Fortress, you will countermand any order which may have been given by Gen' Gaines for its being relieved, and notify me of the circumstances which you may become possessed of in relation to this business.
You will receive here with Three Hundred and fifty Dollars to enable you to reach your point of destination—and from Montpelier, when I forward you the necessary Proclamation to be promulgated on receiving possession of the Country I will furnish you such additional sum, as I may deem necessary—in the mean time should necessity require, you can draw upon me as before instructed.
I have full confidence that in performing this duty you will act with your usual prudence, conforming strictly to your instructions, and should the Spanish Authority claim the right of taking the Ordinance, you will remonstrate, as being inconsistent with that liberal construction which the United States are disposed to give to the Treaty but if persisted in, you will comply with the Sec of States instructions
<pb#54 />
N° 1. (both letters of the Sec of State containing instructions &c.
enclosed”)
On your arrival at Amelia Island you will address a communication to the Governor of St. Augustine, and forward it to him by a confidential Officer, in which you will inform him of your arrival &
commission &c. &c. requesting him to inform you if he has rec"
instructions to deliver over to the United States the Country &
Fortifications ceded. It is probable that from the instructions to Col:
Forbes," the Governor & Captain Gen' of Cuba has forwarded the order for delivery, direct to St. Augustine, if so, you will be in possession of that part of Florida, as soon as I shall receive Pensacola.
It is important that we should have possession of the Country as early as possible to prevent smuggling and the introduction of Africans—
to prevent which; you will be vigilent and receive possession as soon as practicable I am Sir very respectfully Yr Me Ob"S"

<docbody>SIR On the evening of the 22" ins" I reached this City on my way to Montpelier, and will if I can procure a transport, proceed on my journey on the 26" instant.
Immediately on my arrival M. Frommentin waited upon me, and produced a commission dated in the year 1819," authorising him to receive the Floridas together with the Archives at Pensacola and St Augustine. He appeares to be impressed with a belief, that although, that part of his commission to receive the Floridas was superseded, yet as the executive had been silent on the subject of the Archives to be rec" at Pensacola &", that he with my approval was entitled to the safe keeping of them—From the tenor of my instructions, I do not conceive that I can create any office in the Floridas that does not exist there at present, and that clerks of any kind except those that are contemplated under my instruction to translate and transcribe the archives for the information of the President, cannot be necessary until the next meeting of Congress—However should the President be
<pb#57 />
of opinion that a safe keeper of the Archives should be necessary, and that M. Frommentin should be appointed to that trust, and express the same to me with the salary to be annexed, I will immediately notify M. Frommentin thereof and request his removal to Pensacola—
But it does not appear to me that there can arise a necessity for any individual to have a copy of any of the records before the meeting of next Congress I shall therefore not make any appointment of this kind, until I hear from the President on the subject I have here met with Maj. Staunton of the Quarter-Masters Department, who advises me that he is without Quarter Master funds for the purpose of carrying into effect the transportation of the civil and military officers of Spain, from the Florida's as stipulated under the late treaty with Spain, and informs me that it is understood by the Quar-Master Gen', that through me the funds necessary to carry into effect the stipulation for transporting the Spanish Troops are to be obtained—From the perusal of my instructions, it does not appear that I am not authorised to draw upon the State Department for Quartermaster funds, but will take upon me the responsibility so to do. I thought it most advisable to endeavour to raise here by a draft upon your Department the sum necessary to meet the expenses of receiving the country and organising the Government, fearing that a draft would not be sold at Mobile or Pensacola, for this purpose I
offered for sale a draft, and found I could not obtain United States paper for it without a discount, I therefore directed Maj. Staunton to apply to the Branch Bank of the United States, to be informed whether it would advance upon my draft—it refused. I then addressed a note to the collector Mr Chew,” the enclosed is his answer"—
I also enclose the statement of Maj. Staunton,” from all which you will discover that without a discount, money cannot be obtained here on drafts upon the Government—no delay however shall occur in the transportation of the Spanish Troops from the want of funds, as far as I can command them—nor will I ever consent to sell bills on the Government at a discount to any, and more particularly to the Branch Bank of the United States, in which is depositted all the revenue of the Government rec" at this place. I shall endeavour at Mobile or Pensacola to raise the necessary funds on drafts—Should I fail there, I trust upon the receipt of this, the Government will instruct the Branch Bank to furnish me with the amount that may be necessary to meet the expenses that may occur in receiving the Floridas and organising the Government thereof *

<docbody>SIR, I arrived at this place on the morning of the 29th Ul" and immediately communicated with Montpelier by express;—which returned last evening, with information that no advices had been received there from Col Forbes—
Being informed that associations exist, for the purpose of introducing a number of Africans into Florida, before the change of Government, and for this purpose an agent from Baltimore and another from the East, are now, the one in Pensacola and the other in Cuba or Bahama Island—To obtain possession of the ceded Country as soon as possible, and thereby prevent the furtherance of this dreaded evil, I have this morning despatched Doct" Bronaugh” and Judge Brackenridge,” with communications to the Governor of Pensacola,” copies of which I send you herewith marked N° 1 and 2,” and also with
<pb#59 />
instructions to enquire into the truth of a complaint made to me in New Orleans and reiterated here, that, the Spanish subjects in Pensacola are in the habit constantly of pulling down the houses of nonresident Americans, for fuel.
My Aid de Camp Capt. Call,” whom I sent from Nashville over land to Montpelier, has not reached that place owing as it is believed to the unusual freshets, prevalent in the upper country—This will detain me here, untill the arrival of my horses and untill the return of the Gentlemen whom I have sent to Pensacola—
I have directed Col Brook,” in command at Montpelier to forward to this place all communications which may be received at Montpelier for me—
As soon as I hear from the Governor of Pensacola I will communicate to you his reply—
I have signified to Commodore Patterson * the propriety of sending a vessel to take a recognizance of the Florida Coast as far as Tampa Bay—to intercept any American vessel loaded in whole or in part, with Africans—

Soldiers on their voyage to Cuba and the inconvenience of preparing their bread on board; I have directed him to order Cap" Rodgers” of the Commissariat Dep" at Orleans to have a sufficient quantity of sea biscuit, prepared for their supply In this arrangement there will be a saving of Tonage to the U States and it will have the happy effect of preventing any complaints from Spain on the score of supplies or as to the liberality of the Government of the U States in their construction of the Treaty—I hope this measure will meet the approbation of the President"—

<docbody>SIR, On the receipt of your letter of the 10" of last month, I submitted the point in your account, which you presented, for the decision of the Attorney General,” as the highest law authority; and I now enclose you, for your information, his decision in the case.
The 24 Auditor informs me that your account of disbursements under the Choctaw treaty,” will be closed, as soon as the receipt of the contractor for the $2000, paid to him by the allowance of this Department, and evidence of the payment, or deposit of the balance are transmitted to him. The Auditor will write you today giving you a statement of what the balance is after giving you a credit for the $2000 with instruction to pay it over to pay master Randall or Burch, if you have not made other disposition of it.
The President has referred so much of your letter to the State Department of the 2" April,” as relates to the Indians in Florida, to this Department. He is of the opinion, that no immediate measure
<pb#61 />
ought to be taken, as to the Creek Indians in Florida; but that some step ought to be taken to ascertain their views, numbers &c., in order to adopt proper measures hereafter in relation both to them and the Seminoles It is certainly desireable on many accounts to remove them from Florida; but it is highly probable, that the people of Georgia would object strongly to the arrangement of ordering them to the Creek Country; as it might prolong the time of the extinguishment of the Indian title within its limits. In fact during the last session, the idea was suggested, and it was very apparent, that it would not be relished I hope, however, that some opportunity may present itself, of making an arrangement which may be satisfactory. As soon as it can be done, it will be the policy of the government to remove them. Its view on this point, was communicated to you in the copy of the instructions to the Sub-agent for the Indians in Florida, and the letter, under cover of which, it was transmitted to you.”
I fear from the great infirmity of Gen' Porter, who was charged with the arranging and ordering the detachment of the light artillery from Boston to Amelia Island, to garrison St Augustine, that some delay may take place in their arrival. He mistook a part of the orders, which made it necessary to correct his error, and it is probable that the detachment did not sail till the 28* of last month.
I trust, however, that not much inconvenience will result.
I have the honor to be Your Obed Ser"

<docbody>JAMES MONROE, President of the United States of America.
To all who shall see these presents, Greeting:
Know Ye, That reposing special Trust and Confidence in the Wisdom, Uprightness and Learning of WILLIAM P. DUVAL of Kentucky, I do appoint him Judge of the United States for East Florida,”
with the exception of that part which lies Westward of the Cape, to reside at S*Augustine;” and do authorize and empower him to execute the War of 1812, in which he served at the battle of New Orleans, Gadsden examined and reported upon the fortifications of New Orleans and Mobile and their dependencies. He prepared a similar report in 1818 upon the defenses of Spanish West Florida. He was promoted to a captaincy in 1818 and on Oct. 1, 1820 became a colonel and Inspector General of the Southern Division under Jackson. A friend of Secretary of War Calhoun, and strongly recommended by Jackson, he was appointed, Aug. 13, 1821, Adjutant General of the Army by the President (Bassett, ed., Corr. Jackson, III, 47, 59). He served in that position only until Mar. 22, 1822, however, for the Senate refused to confirm the appointment on the ground that officers senior to him in rank had been passed over in violation of the act for the reduction of the Army approved Mar. 2, 1821 (Senate, Exec.
Journal, III, 266, 280, 282,292, 298; A. S. P., Mil. Affairs, II, 397). This action terminated his Army career, and he moved from Washington to Charleston. His appointment as a commissioner to negotiate a treaty with the Seminoles in Florida
(post, p. 659) in 1823, through the influence of the Sec. of War (Bassett, ed., op.cit., III, 194), led to his settlement in the Territory where he was to take an important part in public affairs and in the development of the area. The article by J. Fred Rippy in the Dict. Amer. Biog., VII, 83–84, indicates, apparently incorrectly, that Gadsden went to Florida in 1822. See also indexes to present volumes on Florida Territory.

<docbody>SIR, I embrace the first opportunity by the mail which leaves here tomorrow morning, of communicating such information relative to the detachment under my command, and our prospects of proceeding to our post of destination, as may be interesting and proper for you to be acquainted with "-
At Charleston, we took on board D. M'Crosky," who is to be stationed at this post–We arrived in the harbor here, on the 15", The troops in good order and perfect health—Finding no ether instructions here, other, than to remain until further orders—that
<pb#67 />
Major Cross was at S*Augustine—but that Lieut. & Q Master Baird,"
had received instructions from the Q Mas Gen' to afford Major Cross every facility required to forward the transport of the detach"

<docbody>I have signed the commissions intended for the officers in Florida, & now return them. I wish M Adams however to consider whether it will not be adviseable to amend the commissions for the judges, so far as to make them correspond se far as te make them eerrespeñd with their respective jurisdictions in some such form, “I do appoint him judge of the U States for West Florida, & for that part of East Florida which lies westward of the Cape, to reside at Pensacola &c.”
It may be done without preparing a new commission, as I presume.
<pb#68 />
If such alteration is deemd material, perhaps it may be proper to extend it to these the commissions of the Attornies & Marshall, giving to the latter, in his commission, a power to appoint a deputy, or deputies.
I am inclined to think that I had better appoint an Attorney for East Florida, it not being usual for the district attornies to appoint deputies, as it is for Marshalls. Mr Bird of Georgia has been well recommended and is willing to go there.”

<docbody>SIR, On my arrival at this place, I found the Detachment under the Command of Cap" J R Bell of the Light Artillery and on yesterday witnessed their inspection—Their health & condition as well as the state of their arms; were highly praiseworthy and speaks much in favour of their comm” officer—
Maj. Cross returned from Augustine on the 18" and it appears the Governor was then without advices autherizing the delivery of the Province—
Believing that the Service will be benefitted, and the wishes of the Executive met, by a speedy possession of the Ceded Country, I have concluded to proceed directly to Augustine, and will therefore sail in Lieu" Paynes "vessell today & I feel persuaded that the arrangements can be entered into immediately, unless there should be an unwillingness on the part of the Spanish authorities; & Such are the arrangements on the part of the U, States, that I trust no obstacle can be presented on our part—
I would beg leave to Suggest, that the Strength of Augustine might be augmented by the removal of Cap' Paynes" company from this place, as after the delivery of Florida measures can be adopted for the
<pb#69 />
Goverment of the place without the presence of a Military force which seems to me entirely unnecessary from its location—As belonging to the U, States the revenue will be protected by the naval &
cannot be by the land forces—These Suggestions are made to induce your attention & unless there should be some important reasons for the military occupancy of it, I should be pleased to receive instructions to have the Troops & Stores removed—
The escort destined for the Spanish Troops from E, Florida had not reached Augustine when Maj. Cross left there—but I am of the opinion, that it passed thither on the 19* as several guns were distinctly heard off this place, and I infer they were intended as signals—
The provisions to subsist the Spanish troops have not yet reached us, but advices, give room to hope, that we shall have them very shortly—
Should any thing interesting occur after my arrival at Augustine, I shall do myself the honor to communicate again.
I request permission to give a name to the Fortress of Augustine *
on taking possession of it; will you have the goodness to grant me this privilege "—

<docbody>DEAR SIR. This letter, with such further communications from the Secretaries of State & War, as the arrangments in Florida may re-
7" Enclosed in a letter of July 30, 1821, from Jackson to the Secretary of State
(post, p. 137).
<pb#74 />
quire, will be forwarded to Milledgeville by mail, and thence by a special messenger to you at Pensacola, or elsewhere, to whatever place you may be at.
The arrangments under the treaty being committed to me, by a concise law,” expressd in general terms, I have bestowed on the subject, all the consideration which its high importance requird, & used my best exertions, to give effect to every object contemplated by it, in a manner to satisfy the just claims of my country. Several duties distinct in their nature, were injoind on me by the Law. The territory ceded, was to be taken possession of, & the Spanish officers &
soldiers were to be transferred to Cuba: a temporary gov" was to be organizd over the Floridas, for the protection of the inhabitants, in the free enjoyment, of their liberty, property, and religion, for which purposes, the military, civil & judicial powers heretofore exercised by the authorities of Spain, should be vested in proper officers of the U States, & exercised in such manner as should be designated. The laws of the U States relating to revenue, & the slave trade, were declard to be in force in the said territories, & it was injoind on me to establish such districts, for the collection of the revenue, & to appoint such officers, whose commissions should expire at the end of the next Session of Congress, to enforce the said laws, as might be deemed expedient. The establishment of the boundary, between the U States
& Spain, westward, of the Mississippi, was another object, & the institution of a board of commissioners, to consist of three persons, for the settlement of the claims of such of our citizens, as had been plunderd at sea, & elsewhere, was a third. As incident to the last, was the distribution of 5 millions of do", should the claims amount to that sum, among such of our citizens as should be entitled thereto, on fair examination, & on just principles; and should the claims exceed that sum, by a proportionate reduction of cash, so as to render to every one justice, giving him his due, and no more, & in so doing, sustain the character of the government & nation, for integrity, and impartiality.
Although those duties were distinct, and to be perform'd at places very distant from each other, yet in providing for their execution, it was necessary for me to take a combined view of the whole, and in the appointment of officers, especially, to look to the nation; distributing them among the states, so far as it might be practicable, without neglecting other objects equally important.
In executing that portion of the trust relating to the Floridas, I
have gratified in a high degree my feelings, in committing the chief power to you, who have render'd such important services, & have such just claims to the gratitude of your country. It must be agreeable to
<pb#75 />
you, from many considerations which will occur, to take possession of the Floridas, & cause the Spanish authorities & troops to be remov’d to Cuba. It must be equally so, to establish the government of the U States, & to administer it, in their behalf, in those territories. I
have every reason to believe that the nation generally, have beheld with profound interest and satisfaction, your appointment,” considering it a just tribute of respect, to your extraordinary services &
merit, & having the fullest confidence that its duties will be discharged, with the utmost ability & integrity.
As the territory had been divided into two provinces, under Spain, &
still retained that form, notwithstanding all that part of W. Florida, west of the Perdido, had been taken from it,” and more especially, as Pensacola & S*Augustine were separated at such a distance, and by a wilderness, it was thought adviseable, for the present, to adopt the arrangement, in some of its parts, to that circumstance. In regard to your office, both provinces will form but one territory. Your powers will be the same over the whole; but as your residence will be fixd at one only, and as I presume at Pensacola, I have thought it proper to appoint two Secretaries, one for Pensacola, & the other for S*Augustine, both equally under your controul. I have divided the territory, with a view to revenue, into three districts, that portion which lies between the S. Marys & Cape Florida into one, S*Augustine being its port of entry & delivery; that, between the Cape & the Apalachicola, into another, S' Marks being its port; and that lying between the Apalachicola & the Perdido into a third, Pensacola, being its port. I have established two judicial districts, one Judge in each, Pensacola to be the residence of one, & S*Augustine of the other. I have appointed M." Fromentin, judge at the former, & Mr Duvall, at the latter.”
Both those gentlemen I presume you are acquainted with, the one having servd in the Senate from Louisiana, & the other in the house of Rep" from Kentucky. M. Walton of Georgia is secretary, at Pensacola" the descendant & Representative of the member of Congress of that name, who voted for & signd the declaration of Independance;
Mr Worthington of Maryland is Secretary at S*Augustine,” a person
<pb#76 />
who acted as political agent of the U States, some years, at Buenos Ayres & Chile.
Mr Alex Scott of Maryland is appointed Collector of the Customs,”
Mr Steuben Smith of N York Naval officer, Mr Hackley, of Virg"
Surveyor, & M Baker * of this place Inspector, at Pensacola. The first mentiond is is a man of considerable literary acquirments, & strict integrity, well connected in this State. The second is the son of Col.
W" Smith, who was aid de camp, to Gen" Washington, in the revolutionary war, & afterwards Secr” of legation at London, where the he married the daughter of M" Adams, former President. He is the nephew of the present Secry of State, & his wife is the sister of M"
Adams. Of M* Hackley you may have heard, in Spain. His wife is the sister of Gov. Randolph of Virg" & M Madison & others our friend, have strongly recommended him to me. As these persons are I believe literally poor, as is indeed, M. Baker, who was formerly consul in Spain & Italy, & in whose favor Mr Jefferson takes an interest, I wish you to place them, if possible, in some of the public buildings, of which I presume there are some not necessary for your own accomodation. It is, I believe, customary, for the revenue officers to be thus provided, wherever it is practicable, and in no instances, can such provision be more important or indispensible to the parties than the present. M. Rodman of New York is appointed Collector at St Augustine, & Mr Mark Hardin of N° Carolina at S*
Marks. Young Anderson of Tennessee is appointed d. attorney.
To the Board of Commiss" Judge White of Tennessee, Gov"
King, of Maine, and M. Tazewell of Virg" are appointed. As the claimants reside, in the great towns, along the coast, it was thought it best to select the commiss" from other quarters, in the belief that as they would be not only disinterested, but unprejudiced, being equally unacquainted with the parties, & their claims, a board thus composed would inspire greater confidence in the nation, if its decisions might not be more correct.
Col: Butler lately of your staff is appointed Col: of the 4* Reg' of Infantry, & Major Call retains his rank of Capt" in the line. It would have given me pleasure to have placd the latter near you, but eń on great consideration, I thought it better for you as well as for myself, to pursue the course I have done. M” Walton was strongly supported by the two Senators from Georgia, M Walker,” & M"
Elliot," both estimable men—I could do nothing else for him, &

You go, yearself, & take M” Jackson with you, into a new climate, as is represented, and we believe, a very healthy one. Take care of yourself & of her, for we wish to meet you both again.
I have full confidence that your appointment will be immediately &
most beneficially felt. Smugglers & slave traders will hide their heads; pirates will disappear, & the Seminoles, cease to give us trouble.
So effectual will the impression be, that I think, the recollection of your past worries, will smoothe your way as to the future. Past experience shews, that neither of us are without enemies. If you still have any, as may be presumed, they will watch your mov'ments, hoping to find some inadvertent circumstance, to turn against you.
Be therefore on your guard. Your country indulges no such feelings.
From it you will find, a liberal confidence, & a generous support.”

<docbody>MAJOR GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON Governor of East & West Florida SIR I have had the honour of receiving your Letters of the 2.”
12 and 12 of April * from Nashville. The request of instructions relating to the Seminole Indians contained in the first of them having been referred by the President to the Secretary of War, has been answered through that Department.”
The List of Officers appointed by the President within the Territory which is transmitted to you consists altogether of Citizens of the United States the objects of their respective functions being the introduction and establishment of the Laws of the Union in the Country.
It is not however the intention of the President that in the distribution of Official situations the natives or inhabitants of the Country itself should be overlooked—The offices the duties of which relate to the Civil and internal administration of the Territory, will be those for
<pb#78 />
which the qualifications of the people of the Country will be peculiarly appropriate, and leaving the distribution of them entirely to your discretion, he is confident it will be exercised with a just regard to the interests and feelings of the people of Florida; and in a manner which may tend at once to their satisfaction, and to render their change of condition as acceptable to their inclinations, as it is hoped it will be propitious to their welfare.”

<docbody>SIR, I have this moment received your letter of the 1" of May with its enclosure.”
I have duly noted your observations on the subject of the Indians in the Floridas, but I have not received the copy of the instructions to the Sub Agent for the Indians in Florida,” nor the letter” under cover of which it was transmitted to me. When it reaches me it shall be duly attended to. I would barely remark that M*Queen, and his son resided before the Creek war in the very heart of the Creek Nation.
They fled to Florida, has continued their hostility until conquered and ordered to return to his own nation. Surely Georgia could not complain of his being compelled to return to the limits of his nation.
However this is a subject for the deliberation of the government and whatever may be its instructions will be duly observed by me. One thing is very certain. As long as they are permitted to remain in the Floridas, it will be a receptacle for rogues, murderers, and runaway negroes.
I will thank you to forward me a duplicate of your instructions to the Sub Agent for the Florida Indians. You will excuse this sheet, as we are here without supplies of stationery, &c, Our baggage having been left to be transported with our books to Orleans by water. I have nothing from the Hornet since the 7", the day on which M Thompson”
left her. Therefore the troops from Boston, if they sailed on the 28”
ultimo will be in time for the Hornet. Suppose the Hornet does not come before the lapse of six months, or if she does the Governor

<docbody>SIR. I have the honor to inclose for your information a copy of a letter from James Ramage Esq. Commander of the United States Schooner Porpoise, addressed to Governor Coppinger"—also, the Governors answer as connected with his note to me of this morning”—M Ramage anchered off the bar on yesterday and sent the note by the Governm" pilot, and shortly after weighed ancher &
sailed eastwardly and has not since been seen—
The Governor is yet without any instructions from Cuba, and contemplates dispatching a vessel to that place on tomorrow with a view to obtain some information—His ostensible object, I have reason to believe is to urge the necessity of his being furnished with funds to pay off debts to a considerable amount, which he stands individually pledged for, and also to obtain funds to pay the Troops, who are I
believe, in a very ungovernable and mutinous state—
I am occasionally furnished with information of threats on the part of the Spanish Officers and soldiers against the Americans, but I view these expressions as idle and intitled to no consideration—I
feel assured that they shall not have any grounds upon which to found vindictive passions—
The Indians are frequent here, parading the streets in a drunken, riotous manner—There is almost a total absence of legal Government at this time, and it is more than desirable that we should get immediate possession to prevent abuses which rumour says, are going on with regard to landed titles—I am informed that the authorities here, having possession of those titles, are determined to ship them at all hazards, alledging as a reason that the United States would find it her interest to destroy them—but if my information is correct, the reason is founded on their having mutilated them by antidating tearing out and inserting leaves, so as to make grants for much larger tracts of land than were originally given—
I have received this information in a manner that I cannot make any use of it, until there is some person appointed, with whom I can officially communicate.
I have not heard from General Jackson by letter, since we parted;
and remain entirely uninformed, whether the Hornet, has yet reached Pensacola or not—I am autherized by my instructions to draw on the
<pb#81 />
General for such funds as may be required should he not send them to me; but I find it impossible to raise funds by draft on him, & I
have advised him that I should draw directly on you, if it became necessary and I even fear; that, that cannot be accomplished short of Darien—I hope this measure, will be approved if adopted; as the amount will be small—
I shall give you the earliest advice, of the arrival of the Order from the Capt. General of Cuba; and have only to add, that every arrangement on the part of the U: States, has been made; and only awaits the conclusion of the negotiation—

<docbody>SIR I had the satisfaction to receive your note of this morning"
in which you are pleased to inform me that you have received “competent orders”. to arrange the delivery of this province to the Com-

missioner authorized by the government of the United States to receive it. As we now are the mutually declared authorities touching this business, and as I presume, you are as I am, satisfied in this official recognition. I shall at once conform to my instructions by opening the subject generally that no unnecessary delay may arise.
To enable me to comply with the provisions of the 7" Article of the treaty, lately ratified by our respective governments, it becomes necessary to call on your Excellency for a statement of the number of officers both civil and military and troops," for which I am to provide transportation to the Havanna, and also to arrange the provisions for their subsistence, which altho’ not expressly mentioned in the treaty, yet the liberal construction, which my government is disposed to give that instrument has induced the arrangement. It is desirable also to have a distinction drawn between those officers who have families and those who have not, as I feel disposed to afford as much comfort as possible without departing from my instructions in the arrangement of the transports. As this information is important to the immediate consummation of my preparatory duties, I hope you will give me early advices, to enable me to place myself subject to your wishes in the final arrangement.
To evince my respect for you personally, as well as officially, and feeling as I do every friendly disposition towards cultivating, the happy understanding which exists between our respective governments, I am induced to ask your Excellency to embrace in the form of a projet 1" your wishes with regard to the manner and probable time of delivery of the province under your command. 2" the subject islands dependant on said province 3" public Lotts and squares 4" public edificies, 5" fortifications with their appendant defences 6* Barracks and other buildings, which are not private property, and 7” the Archives and documents which relate directly to the property and sovreignty of said province, accompanied with a schedule of the property contained under the 2" 3" 4* 5" & 6th heads.
The arrangements which may relate to the embarkation of your troops, I shall leave out of view for the present, as I desire on this head to consult your wishes, in a conference previous to entering of record any preliminaries, touching that point, believing as I do, that we can more satisfactorily meet each others views by a conference than written communications As the projet which I have requested is when complete to be in the character of a general arrangement destined to be passed for the information of our respective governments, as an acquittal of the duties required of us, I feel the more solicitious, that you should
<pb#83 />
submit it, as the most particular evidence of the friendly disposition of the government which I have the honor to represent.”

SIR, Your letter of the 21" ultimo is received," and your propositions to augment the Garrison of S*Augustine by adding the Company stationed at Fernandina, and of changing the name of the Fortress there have been submitted to the President, who altho' he views the subject of keeping a company at Fernandina as you do, yet as he considers the proposed strength of the Garrison for S*Augustine sufficient he does not think it advisable to place it there particularly as there are so many other points on the Atlantick frontier that will require it.
In regard to the fortress whose name you propose to change, as the President presume it has a Spanish name, and as he considers it unadvisable to change names except in case with some manifest necessity, which he does not think exists on the present occasion, he does not think it proper to give you on the present occasion permission to change the name as you request.”
The provisions to Subsist the Spanish troops sailed from New York a month ago and have no doubt reached their destination before this.”

<docbody>SIR I have the honor of anouncing to you at length my arrival here this day and of my visit to the Governor who has assured me of his readiness to deliver this province—
Upon farther Conversation with my Spanish Colleague Don Alva during the passage, I find that he alone is charged with the delivery of the province of East Florida and that Don Arredondo the Administrator was only to be the Bearer of despatches in the Nonsuch—
From all the information I can collect here, I feel confident that the Spanish authorities are as anxious to quit this Territory as we are to become possessed of it.
As the Governor had not read his despatches, he promised to answer in writing my question this day (say in the evening) which was when I could notify the Government of his readiness to evacuate the Posts According to your orders I have given by this Conveyance notice

CIRCULAR TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OF THE UNITED STATES *
TREASURY DEPARTMENT, Fifth Auditor's Office, June 11, 1821.
SIR. The President of the United States having, under the authority vested in him by the Act of May 15, 1820,” entitled “An Act providing for the better organization of the Treasury Department,” a Copy of which is hereunto annexed, designated me “Agent of the Treasury, to direct and superintend,” from and after the first of July next, “all orders, suits, or proceedings, in law or equity, for the recovery of Money, chattels, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, in the name and for the use of the United States,” I take occasion thus early to apprize you of the circumstance, and to request that the statement required to be transmitted by the seventh section of the said act, may, after that period, be forwarded to this office. With a view to uniformity in the returns to be made under that section, by the several District Attorneys, the necessity for a prompt and regular transmission of which I cannot too forcibly urge, a form has been prepared, of which I send enclosed—printed copies. When these are exhausted, other copies will be supplied, on your requisition.
The large and increasing amount due, and withheld by individuals, to the United States, for which suits have unavailingly been instituted in almost every section of the country, while the government has been obliged to resort to loans to supply a deficiency thus created, has been a cause of just and severe animadversion. It is to be hoped, therefore, that you will use your best exertions, in every case where suit has been, or may be, instituted in your district,” to obtain a recovery
<pb#86 />
of the money, and a payment of it into the Treasury, with as little delay as the forms of law will admit of.
So far as the instructions heretofore given by the Comptroller, may apply, you will be governed by them, until they shall be specially superseded by others from this Office.
I am &c.

<pb#87 />
altho' you have pointed out to me that it was believed on your part, that a more summary mode than that I have proposed was the persuasion in which your government was would be observed, I must remark that attending to what the treaty Royal schedule of delivery, orders of my Captain Gen' and the importance of the same affair merits I have thought the proposal the most analogical and worthy to fill the objects, altho I am disposed to rectify it in any of the parts that do not agree or are unnecessary in the insinuated requisites. Coinciding with the ideas that you have manifested me it is my desire that our respective Commissions be complied with as soon as possible; but having, received at the same time the order for the delivery of this Province, with those that ought to have been communicated ere this, to prepare and facilitate said delivery, is therefore the cause that it cannot be executed in all its parts with that despatch we desire: On that account I request your attention in respect to the advices and intelligence my government has given me, regulated to the treaty to make known to all the inhabitants of the country, in as much as that part stipulated in respect to them, as also the particular steps they have determined, shall be taken for those who wish to emigrate to various parts of the Spanish Dominions: The Artillery, military stores, and ammunition, that are to be transported is another of the important points, the operation of which demands some order and time; in this particular as well as others, altho' they are not of as much consequence, it is requisite to execute them. I therefore consider it necessary we should establish a private conference, a medium by which we can conciliate our respective opinions, and accellerate its brevity, for which case I reserve manifesting you my observations, that united with those you may uniformly make, can be formalized in a species of Convention that will point out with exactitude the method of the operation and will deliver us from some difficulties that generally occur in such cases. In answer to the first particular of your note of the 8* ins** enclosing you a circumstantial account of the Military force of this Garrison, including the families belonging thereto; likewise another, of those employed in this place under the immediate dependancy of the National Finance, both one and the other, with their respective remarks for the ends that may be thought necessary.” Before leaving off this subject, rendering your government the honor and justice it merits, I pay them the tribute of my sincere thanks for the liberal sense given to the 7*Article of the treaty, generously supplying the necessary provisions during the voyage of the officers, troops and those persons employed in the finance, and to you sir, for the frankness you have manifested, and which no doubt will shorten our future communications. As I have
<pb#88 />
heretofore expressed, I think it proper there should be a personal interview for arranging the embarkation of said Artillery, military Stores, and ammunition, and other particulars which I wish to communicate. We will then determine positively the day on which the delivery of the province under my charge can be effected, as all other calculations would be useless without such an antecedent agreement.
In respect to the Lotts, Squares, public edifices, fortifications, Barracks and other public property, with the documents and archives that appertain directly to the right and sovreignty of this province, you can immediately designate the person or persons that are to receive the inventories plans &c, to prepare and advise the needful
(for the purpose of advancing this operation) to the Commandant of engineers of this City, for the delivery of each of the respective departments, and also the documents appertaining to individual property, and those alluding to the sovreignty of the province, for which I will give the competent order, when I am advised by you of those chosen for the purpose. To give you as I wish an exact account of the adjacent Islands to this province, is almost beyond my power, for the want of a general map that deleniates their positions, extension and circumstances, but with the exception of Amelia, which is in the posession of the United States, and that, forming the harbor of this port, known by the name of St Anastacia, on which is situated the look out house, all the rest are nearly without population, as likewise the public lands: you will therefore have a knowledge of those to be taken posession of as Gov" property, under the impression there may be of their not being granted. I beleive want of exactitude will Suffer no difficulties to arise, seeing the good faith and long posession the Spanish Government has had of them since the treaty concluded between her and great Brittain in Versailles the 19* Sept 1783, in which no particular specification is made of said islands, nor is there any document relative to the affair. The plain and ingenuous manifestation with which I have tried to satisfy the particulars contained in your note of the 8" must convince you of the friendly disposition to fill the Commission confided to me, with that harmony and friendship which has untill now guided us, and which I am certain will not be interrupted, as I have the greatest opinion of the amiable qualities which adorn you. God preserve you many years.”

<docbody>DEAR SIR Having occasion to send to Washington to morrow, I
avail myself of the opportunity a day sooner than the mail would afford it, to return to M*Adams some interesting papers" & among them one from Col: Forbes,” at Havanna, & one from General Jackson,” on the latter of which, or rather more especially on the course, which I
think, ought to be pursued, in the present juncture, I have expressd my sentiments very fully. We must either move our troops instantly to the coast or return to the upper country. To do the latter would I think be in the highest degree disgraceful. It seems best therefore to move to the coast, & take safe positions [MS. torn *] Spaniards do not forthwith evacuate, [MS. illegible "] with the Spanish troops.
Gen' Jackson should organize a gov", issue a proclamation, & and declare our jurisdiction established. no harm can result from this
& much good may.
The generals letter is in my opinion sound in principle, & he declares himself, as obeying orders, in waiting the arrival of the Hornet
&c but he might have said that he presumd & believd his course would be fully approvd by his gov". It would have had the appearance of greater respect, but not the reality as I presume.
I enclose you an incorrect copy, being the first draft of my letter to Mr Adams," with the omission of a paragh or two at the end wh.
I have not time to add, that you may be acquainted with the object of the meeting of the adm" which in that paragh is [MS. illegible "]
before it takes place. Much is to be done by your dep', and some-
<pb#90 />
thing depends in regard to Gen' Jackson's letter, on the instructions to him from you, as with us from Mr Adams. [MS. illegible *].
If the course which I would suggest is approvd instructions to the effect pointed out should be given by Mr Adams to General Jackson, & by you in decided terms to General Gaines & others—
very sincerely yours JAMES MONROE
It would have better if the troops had been orderd in the first instance to the coast, but that was declind from delicacy to Genl Wives, who requested that they might not enter till the Spanish were removd.
Your communication therefore with him will be proper.
If this plan is not adopted, we must order Gen' Jackson not to move.
I think however the true course is as stated in my communication.
Avoiding collision with the Spanish troops there is no danger, and it puts the delay, if imputable to the Spanish officers; & the perfidy, if imputable to the govt, in a more odious light, & forces with more certainty the effect. To stand where we are, or move back, would
|be expose us eminently, the territory being ours.
Perhaps it might be best simply to state to the Spanish minister, that we our troops could not remain where they are on account of sickness. and had movd forward, in expectation that the Spanish troops would soon evacuate. However every thing will be considerd.
Return me the paper enclosed.”

I had Sent Capt Call" to Pensacola cloathed with powers to make all necessary arangements with the Governor, for the Speedy evacuation of St Marks on the arival of Col” Forbes, that its garrison might be transported under convoy of the Hornet with the other Spanish Troops, the moment the Col” arived Capt Call produced his power and entered with the Governor into this arangement, the Governor offerred promptly to give the order for the delivery, if Capt Call would give him a recept for the ordinance & ordinance Stores attached to & appurtaining to the fortification, to which Capt Call preremtoriyly refused & immediately reported the Same to me—
on which I adressed the Gov'" gave Capt Call written instructions on this point, that if necessary he might shew to the governor, & Capt Call immediately returned to Pensacola—all which in due time will be communicated to you through the Sec of State, and I trust will meet your Views & approbation.
I thank you for the solicitude expressed with regard to the health of M" J. & my self—How far Pensacola may prove beneficial to both or either is to be proven by experience Thus far the climate has proved injurious to both, and neither enjoys good health at present, but I hope Pensacola may prove more hospitable to our constitutions,—Should it not I will have to abandon the climate all toger.

<place-time>No 10. St AUGUSTINE June 15" 1821</place-time>
<docbody>SIR Your note under date of yesterday * in answer to mine of the 13" ins" has been handed to me this morning—I feel great satisfaction at your having given such general attention to the subjects contained in my note aforesaid. There are two points in your note, which claim on my part explanation. The 1* relates to the following Sentence, as given by you in quotation from my note of the 10" Viz
“Fortifications with their dependancies or appertaining defences” as this is calculated to give impressions different from what was expressed, I beg to be excused for giving the annexed quotation from the Copy in my possession bearing date the 8" and not the 10" ins" and which is in the following words Viz “Fortifications with their appendant defences.” The second point relates to the expression in your Excellencys note just received, and of which the following is a quotation
“That your Government considered the Artillery Ammunition and ordnance stores that are in the fortifications appertaining to them by right and that such effects are comprehended in the meaning of the cession. Opposed to which I insert the following quotation, from my note of the 13" ins" and to which you allude Wiz “that my government considered the Artillery in the fortifications appendant and of right belonging to them and embraced in the meaning and intention of the cession and therefore to be left with them!” From this expression your Excellency will certainly perceive that the United States laid no claim to the ammunition and ordnance stores. Could I think myself at liberty to enter into discussion on the merits of the construction which my government has given to the treaty in relation to the Artillery, I flatter myself that I could convince you satisfactorily that the meaning and intention of the contracting parties were, that the Artillery in the fortifications was appendant to and should remain with them. Such would also appear to have been the impression of the Cap". Gen' of Cuba from his order to you of the 5" Ultimo, (a copy of which I have received from the United States Commissioner from Cuba) in which he does not require the removal of the Artillery, added to which, the total silence of the 7" Article of the treaty on the subject of furnishing transportation for the Artillery, ammunition, and ordnance Stores, or even provisions for the subsistence of the Troops on their passage. As I feel myself authorized to infer from your note of the 14" ins" that you are determined to remove the Artillery; it becomes my duty to enter my protest against the measure.
<pb#93 />
But before appending it to this communication, I would suggest that should you feel authorized to form a different conclusion with regard to the Artillery, and determine to leave it, I will engage to furnish a reasonable proportion of transportation for the Ammunition and ordnance stores; but on the other hand should you still determine to remove the Artillery I do hereby respectfully protest against the measure, and declare that I do not consider the U. States bound, to furnish either transportation or escort for the Artillery, ammunition and ordnance stores, and that they have and will exercise a claim on the Spanish government, as well for the Artillery, so removed, as the provisions which they have procured for the subsistence, of the Spanish troops from this to the Havana, should the same be made use of. As this point now remains for decision exclusively with you, and should that decision correspond with the sentiments contained in your last note, I consider it placed out of the pale of my duties, and subject to future discussion between our two respective Governments alone. I have to request that the public property at Amelia Island will also embraced in the plans preparing by the Com" of Engineers.
I shall do myself the honor to call and confer with your Excellency on tomorrow, with respect to our further duties and conclude with renewed assurances of personal esteem and great regard *

SIR, Having been appointed by the President of the United States as was made known to you at a former period by D" Bronaugh * and
<pb#94 />
Judge Brackenridge,” sole Commissioner for receiving possession of the Provinces of East and West Florida, and to fulfil on the part of the American Government so far as connected with the accomplishment of that interesting object, the stipulations of the Treaty of Amity, Settlement of differences and Limits, as concluded by the Plenipotentiaries of Spain and the United States on the 22” February 1819.
and ratified on the corresponding day of 1821; and having been advized by you of your having received an authority from His Catholic Majesty, through the Captain General of Cuba to fulfil the stipulations of the said Treaty so far as connected with the delivery and evacuation of the Province of West Florida. I have to inform you of my arrival at this place, prepared to accomplish the objects of my Commission.
I have to express a wish that a period as early as possible may be concluded on to the mutual convenience of both parties, when we may meet, exhibit our Credentials, officially recognize each other, and enter on the duties of our respective commissions.
This will be handed to you by Col. Gadsden, of the United States army, whom I beg leave to Your Excellency, as a gentleman of great merit; he will take charge of any communication from yourself to me, and has received authority to concert and conclude upon the arrangements with the proposition made.”

PENSACOLA, 16" June 1821.
MOST EXCELLENT SIR, I received yesterday your Excellency's communication of the 12" instant,” dated at Montpelier, and am advised of your having received mine of the 10** as also of the answer you were pleased to make to it.
<pb#95 />
------------e ... viie Forulucations, are to be considered as annexed to them, and included in the cession; you then go on to suggest some reflections of your own, and conclude by stating that you are directed as Commissary to insist that by the stipulations of the
2" article of the Treaty, the Cannon found in the Fortifications and constituting their batteries are dependencies on them, and included in the Cession, and that they should be delivered with the armament generally belonging to that work.
That Your Excellency may not have room to doubt in the least the firmness of the argument to which I must reduce my reply, the object of which is, by avoiding all digressions relative to the particulars of your letter, to spare that time which is so necessary to us both for the fulfilment of our respective duties, as regards the receipt and delivery of West Florida, I must be somewhat diffuse, though diffinitive and conclusive. .
I must then begin by assuring Your Excellency that I respect in every sense the opinion of the President, not only from the dignity of his person, but chiefly from my want of authority to combat that opinion. I must also represent to you that I am not authorized to give any kind of interpretation to the articles of the Treaty: that I
must confine myself to the literal context of them, and to that of the orders received by my Superior for their fulfilment; and lastly that neither is it my province to judge or to investigate the interpretation given or wished to be given by the President to the 7" article (of which you call my attention to the liberal constructions allowed of it by him.) nor to determine what the articles are, that are to be transported, or whether the above mentioned constructions ought to be put into the balance with those which you wish me to admit in the 2" article, as all these questions are directly foreign to the powers in my trust.
I must therefore beg leave to state as follows.
On the 9" instant, I received orders from the Captain General of Cuba, commissioning me to make the necessary preparations for the evacuation of this Province by the Troops of His Catholic Majesty, in the space intervening between the day of receipt of his orders and the 22" August next or sooner if possible, and commissioning me also to arrange the Transportation of the Troops, Artillery, Munitions, &c 60
<pb#96 />
For the observance and accomplishment of this injunction, His Excellency transmits to me therewith a copy of the Treaty, and another of the Royal Letters Patent for the execution of the same," according to its tenor and the stipulations it contains.
In the second article of said Treaty, (amongst other things which I omit as not relating to the present case.) is the following clause:
“His Catholic Majesty, cedes to the United States, in all property and Sovereignty, the public Edifices, Fortifications and barracks. Now a public edifice is one devoted exclusively to National uses, such as Quarters, Hospitals, Magazines, &"—It is evident that the building thus appropriated constitutes the edifice, and that the moveable furniture, which may be placed within it at the owners option, forms no part. He may remove them tomorrow, substitute different ones of equal, greater, or less number, or value; suiting the destination of the building, or with a totally distinct object. Consequently the effects within or without the Edifices are not comprehended under the conclusive and genuine term Edifices, as used in the 2" article.
It is likewise manifest that in this article and with relation to the words specified, it is not said: I cede with them or with the Fortifications the moveables, Artillery, and Munitions, which may or ought to be destined to the same use that the buildings are, amounting to such a number, or in general, or such as they stand at this day, or at the day of their delivery.
It may also be said that it is an axiom admitted in society, that previous to the formation of contracts of all kinds having for their object a sale, a cession, or a transfer, a clear and specific mention is necessarily made of all that is sold ceded or transferred to another.
A Fortification is nothing but an Edifice to which that name is given, and consequently follows strictly the rule above mentioned;
the Artillery, Munitions, provisions, iron-work, arms, and other contents, being the moveables contained in the Edifice, which does not cease, when they are removed to be a Fortification.
The number of pieces of Ordnance at present in West Florida, and the proportion which they bear to its size shew, that they never could all have belonged nor have been necessary to its trifling and feeble Fortifications—another circumstance demonstrative in my opinion that Spain had no intention of ceding them to the United States in the 2" article, since the indispensable mention would otherwise have been made of them.
The inference from the above indisputable points is further confirmed by the concluding clause of the Royal cedula referred to, sent by His Catholic Majesty to the Captain General of the Havana; for (amongst other things which I omit as foreign to the present question) it runs thus, * Dated Oct. 24, 1820, printed ibid., p. 742. 
<pb#97 />
“you will prepare for the delivery of the public Edifices, Fortifications, and barracks, and of all the other effects which may belong to the Nation, and are not found comprehended and mentioned in the expressed clauses of the cession you will cause them to be transported to another point of the Spanish possessions, more convenient to the public Service. The preliminaries being now settled and this reply being reduced to the conclusion to which they lead, if Your Excellency will do me the honour, for the sake of the amity and harmony which reigns between us to put yourself into the place I occupy and the duties I have to discharge, you cannot do less than acknowledge that I ought not, and consequently cannot make you a delivery with the Fortifications of the whole or a part of the Artillery, Munitions, and other articles in this department, to pass with them into the property and under the Sovereignty of the United States.
My warmest wishes have for their single object the good harmony and amity which exist between our respective Governments, and which I desire may reign between us; and I therefore incline to the determination that Your Excellency, (considering the opinion entertained by the President) should represent this difficulty to him, as soon as you have time, as I consider that with His Catholic Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington, he may so arrange the matter as to extricate us both from our embarrassing Situation: in the meantime it appears to me a necessary as well as a warrantable step to place the Artillery of the Forts with all the effects appertaining to them under the safeguard of Your Excellency and the Officers and Troops of the United States after having the proper inventories taken.
A Severe and sudden indisposition prevents my entering for the present moment into farther particulars, of which I will treat with Your Excellency with the first relief that I experience.”
God preserve Your Excellency many Years.

PENSACOLA 18* June 1821.
SIR, Your communication of this date" was not received until after I had made arrangements for leaving Pensacola early tomorrow morning to rejoin General Jackson pursuant to a previous understanding with him.
<pb#98 />
It is possible from an imperfect interpretation of our conversation this evening" we may not distinctly have understood each other; and it may be prudent to commit it to writing what was said as intended and understood by me.
I made you under authority from Gen' Jackson but one proposition, which was for an immediate delivery on your part of the Province of West Florida to General Jackson, retiring with your Military force to any convenient point which might be agreed upon, until the necessary preparatory arrangements &" could be consumated for the embarkation of the Spanish Troops. This was suggested under a belief that such a measure might be a relief to Your Excellency; and prove mutually agreeable to both parties. Of your supposed rejection of this proposition I shall, as you request make no official communication to Gen' Jackson, but leave it to be noticed by you at any convenient or subsequent period.
The substance of my conversation otherwise was not by way of propositions for your assent-General Jackson in his communication to you presented through me, had expressed a wish that a period, and place might be concluded upon for a personal interview, when you might exhibit credentials, officially recognize each other, and be prepared to discharge the complicated duties of your respective commissions. The period and place for this purpose, you was willing, if I
distinctly understood you, to be designated by General Jackson-His repairing therefore as early as convenient to Pensacola, with a small guard and encamping the American Troops in its vicinity was considered by me as one of those preliminary measures necessarily connected with the preparations to be made for receiving the Province of West Florida, as well as for occupying the Military Post as soon as evacuated; and not exposed to any objection on your part—General Jackson's intention therefore was only accidentally mentioned as it was both proper and decorous to advise you of it. The American Troops are dependant upon the supply of Provisions now in Pensacola and their encamping nearer that City than at present, is with a view to their convenience and with no disposition to permit them to come into collision with the Spanish Troops—Such an event is not anticipated and shall be prohibited.
Captain Call will receive and transmit to General Jackson any communications you may wish to make him.”

<docbody>SIR, I received your note of the 16" ins' on that day,” in answer to mine of the 15"," the promised translation was handed me this morning. After duly examining the documents you were pleased to have me furnished with, in relation to the Stores, Artillery &c.; and after a careful examination of my instructions touching those points, I find that I cannot meet your proposition.
While I sincerely regret the difficulties, which we are from our respective instructions placed in, I feel extremely desirous, to place the subject happily at rest between us. And therefore respectfully propose the following arrangement, in addition to that given in my note of the
15" which is, that you will consent to leave all the Artillery, with their implements, and a proportion of ammunition &c, for which I
will give a corresponding receipt, placing the proper construction of the treaty, in the hands of our respective governments. And to facilitate as much as possible the contemplated exchange, I will engage to furnish transportation for the ammunition and stores, save that of the Cannon balls, bombs, and grape shot, which you can have transported. And in like manner, the transportation furnished on my part, as well as the provisions consumed on the voyage, and the amunition which may be left with me, shall be subject to a similar adjustment, on the part of our respective governments. Should your instruction, in conjunction with your sound judgment authorize you to adopt this proposition, I shall be more than pleased, as I am constrained from a sense of duty to say, that it is the only arrangement on this subject which I feel at liberty to enter into. But should your views not correspond with mine, whilst I regret the circumstance, I must refer you to the sentiments of my former note, in which is embodied my protest, for your final decision thereon. It is now proper that I should inform your Excellency that the United States is prepared with escort, transport, provisions and water, to accomodate the Spanish officers and Troops to the Havana, and that I am prepared to enter immediately into the general arrangement for the reception of the province which you have been selected by your Government to deliver. I have designated Major Cross as a fit and proper person to receive the Archives which relate to the sovreignty, and individual property of the province. And Lieu"
Baird of the Corps of Artillery to receive the inventories, plans &c
<pb#100 />
and to take posession of the islands dependant, public Lotts, and squares, public ideficies and other buildings which are not private property, and have therefore to request that you will give the necessary orders in good time, as you were pleased to signify in your note of the 11" ins' I must advert for a moment to the expression in your last note which implies a waste of time in the explanations, which I gave in my note of the 15"—with these sentiments I beg leave to differ, as I deem it an essential duty to correct misunderstandings, or incorrect quotations on important subjects. I need not urge upon your Excellency how desirable it is that the contemplated exchange, should be speedily effected, as well on account of the situation of the troops laying off this City, as the accumulating expence daily arising from our state of preparation under the treaty. Permit me to hope however that I may be furnished with Your final decision on the subject of the Artillery at as early as hour as possible."

The Governor called on Col" Butler last evening and apprised him of the receipt of the necessary instructions—He has hitherto professed a readiness to make a surrender in 24 hours after the arrival of his orders. We may therefore calculate on but little delay.

<docbody>SIR. I received this morning by the hands of Captain Call your valued letter, in which you have the goodness to communicate to me the substance of our yesterday's interview, on the subject of your authorization by his Excellency General A. Jackson.
The points mentioned in your letter of today are, I am now fully persuaded, the same which my interpreter wished to make me comprehend; but I remained so much in doubt as to what was the positive object to which they related, and whether the true sense had been given to my replies, that as a proof of confidence and friendship I
requested for our better understanding that you would set them down in writing and suspend your judgement.
The particular mode of correspondence never was nor could be, nor is, considered by me as an essential point in our official communication on the above particulars, relatively to the said points, consistently with His Excellency Genl Jackson's intimation in his communication giving you authority; this subject therefore although discussed on paper is susceptible of no other understanding than that which might be given it by word of mouth.
I am particularly sorry that my note did not come to hand as soon as I wished; but I can assure you that not eight minutes had elapsed after you left my house, until I despatched my Secretary with it, and the delay in its receipt on your part proceeded from my Secretary not meeting with you in the places where he first directed his search.
Fully sensible as I am of the importance of the enquiries which you wished to make of me in order that you may fulfil the charge entrusted you by His Excellency General Jackson, I request that you will state to him as follows;
That this place being a Seaport, I regard it as a point of absolute necessity, that no more than the authorities of one single nation, should subsist in it at the same time, to prevent the innumerable evils which would result from any other state of things; Besides, as the direction of the different branches under my charge, and the conduct of the measures preparatory to the evacuation, devolve on me, it is absolutely necessary that the command should be vested in my person, until the moment agreed upon for the embarkation of the Troops, the delivery of the Records, and the formalization and conclusion of the documents connected with an affair of such importance as is the evacuation of a Province.
In pursuance of your own observations on the removal of the United States Troops, a measure which may become necessary in
<pb#103 />
consequence or independently of the proposed evacuation, you will also, if you please, apprize His Excellency, the Gen' that I am ready and disposed to enter into any agreement with him, which circumstances may render adviseable.
I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you that I am Yr most Obdt Servt.

<docbody>MOST EXCELLENT SIR./With the correspondence which the Captain General addressed to me per United States Sloop of War Hornet, which anchored in this harbor on the evening of the 10" instant, His Excellency acquainted me that he had delivered a Package for the Governor of East Florida, containing the Orders for its delivery, to the Spanish Citizen Don Pedro de Alva, who came in said vessel and who was to proceed with said Package to St. Augustine; of which he had also notified in the Havana, Col. Ja” G. Forbes the Commissioner of the United States on account of the assistance which it may be necessary for him to afford to Alva.
On the 12" instant, I sent for Captain Call, Your Excellency's Agent here for the transportation of the Garrison of Apalache; I represented to him the despatch with which Alva was entrusted, and that I thought it would be very suitable he should embark in the Transports which were to sail for that destination, whence he might pass over to St Augustine by land, under any arrangements which he might agree upon with Col. Forbes.
Call replied that the Captain of the Hornet had assured him that a United States Schooner had sailed from the Havana for East Florida, to which he had given in charge the Commission of conveying the Packet containing the Captain General's orders for its delivery; and although I insisted that Alva's going thither would not be superfluous, as some unforeseen accident might befal that despatch. The vessels set sail several days after, and neither Alva nor Forbes have taken any measure on the subject, that I could learn.
I required Alva, yesterday, to give me an account of his proceedings with Forbes in relation to the aid which it was proposed at the Havana, * Enclosed in Jackson to the Secretary of State, post, p. 137. 
<pb#105 />
the latter should give him, what arrangements Forbes had made, and how it was, he was remaining wholly inactive here. In reply, Alva informs me Forbes has arranged and agreed on nothing, pursuant to the suggestions which he has made him, and that in a letter which he sent him, he has finally exonerated himself by saying that he would submit the matter to Your Excellency.
It is incomprehensible what a medley the absurdities and visionary projects of Alva and Forbes form; they live together and can alone understand each other; but this much is certain, that the Package is here, and I am at this moment perplexed by the uncertainty of its being or not being in default at St Augustine, and apprehensive of the prejudice which both Nations may sustain, if by mishap the former should be the case.
I entreat Your Excellency, therefore, to have the goodness, in consideration of the foregoing, to let me know, if you have any intelligence of the Orders being actually or probably in St Augustine, and in the contrary case, if Your Excellency thinks the transmission of this Package necessary, what means are at your command for carrying it into effect, or to what other mode of proceeding recourse is to be had.

<docbody>SIR. Before answering the particulars of your note of yesterday,”
I beg leave to inform you that I have given to Major Cross and Lieut Baird the necessary orders as contemplated in your letter of the 19*
and they will wait on your Excellency accordingly. In answering that part of your note aforesaid which relates to the Archives or records of individual property, I take for granted that we understood each other in that respect, fully in our conference yesterday, and will remark accordingly, that as there appears some doubts on your part, you are desirous to await the decision of the Cap' Gen' of Cuba on the subject, at the same time you are disposed to give me an official assurance that they shall not be removed from the province until such decision is received. Your motives cannot be otherwise than approved on my part, and as the Adeline Schooner will return to this port from the Havana, a favorable opportunity offers for the conveyance of the Cap' Gen' answer. You will permit me to hope that you will embody my sentiments as expressed to you on that subject in your letter to the Cap" Gen' as I deem it of the utmost importance for the security of the titles to the property owned by the inhabitants of this province, that the only evidence (which is the records) that will be recognized by my government should remain a permanent basis of security to them in their posession. I will now take up the subject of your Excellencys note of yesterday—and will inform you that the Sloop Endeavor of 40 tons has been procured for the purpose of affording additional accomodations to the families of the officers, and also to transport the ammunition and stores contemplated by our mutual understanding, and which I have deemed sufficient from the official estimate furnished me by your aid de Camp, and which I had the honor at your request, to send you yesterday for examination. The Cap' of this vessel will be instructed to report to you early on tomorrow and take your orders. Enclosed your Exc”
will find an estimate of the provisions to be furnished on my part embracing also their kinds and component parts, which will afford you the information desired. You will also receive a memoranda of the accomodations afforded by the transports," and I am persuaded
<pb#107 />
that you will discover the propiety of placing the military officers who have families on board the Meteor, as the accomodations are entirely private, each stateroom having a Venitian door, and unconnected with each other. The Cabin accomodations of the Sloop also afford much convenience, as you will readily perceive. As you were pleased to express yourself satisfied with these accomodations in our conversation yesterday I shall be gratified to know that you continue so. It may be of some importance to the officer commanding the U.S. convoy to have completed at an early day the arrangements necessary for the government of the fleet. I hope you will afford the information on that head as soon as possible. After expressing my thanks for the exertions you are daily making to facilitate my wishes, I conclude with a hope that you will make a request of the Cap" Gen' that the transports shall enter Havana, and disembark free of duties.

<docbody>In answer to your esteemed note of yesterday, assuring Y. E. as I
mentioned in my letter of the 19" that until I received the answer of my government on the doubts arising on the delivery of the public Archives relating to the individual property of the inhabitants of this province and on which I have on this date wrote for information, they shall not be removed from this place and they shall remain precisely as they are. I shall likewise remain here untill this point is decided as well as that on the Artillery, on which I have made my report and in the mean time I will have formed an exact inventory of the documents contained in those Archives—I will inform H. E. the Cap" Gen' of Cuba, of the sentiments Y. E. has expressed respecting the rights of the inhabitants holding property here; and I will likewise lay before him the question embraced in the last paragraph of Y. E. letter:—
Whether the American transports entering the port of Havana, shall be free of duties. I have noted the object to which your E has destined the Sloop endeavor, and will give orders that her loading shall be entered on as soon as possible; but the article of Powder will be reserved until the last moment in order to diminish the danger of accidents, and for the same reason it appears to me a matter of prudence that no other person should be entered on board of her than the necessary crew—and that the families of the civil officers may not thereby be cramped in their accomodations, I will distribute them in
<pb#108 />
the vessels freighted on my part for the transportation of the Cannon, bombs &c. if Y.E will have the goodness to cause them to be supplied with the rations &c for the Voyage; and with this veiw I will give you timely notice of the distribution I make—The conveniences of the Meteor will be appropriated to the military but as we have seperately agreed the colored troops will be shiped in the transports I have freighted and for which I hope Y. E. will be pleased to order rations to be in readiness for delivery according to advice I shall communicate in proper time. I appreciate the Statement that accompanied your letter for my information, and adverting to that of rations, which is calculated for a voyage of twenty days Y. E. will pardon my making the observation, that in the present season of the year they frequently extended to thirty days, and more. Experience afford no example of vessels having to return here after being twenty five days at sea; and for this very reason the packet Schooner of this Government Barbarita, when sailing to the Havana in these months, is supplied with rations for forty days—I have conceived it proper to state these circumstances for Y. E. information. Annexed is a statement of the vessels for which I have solicited convoy and which I transmit for the purpose Y. E has expressed—and I have much pleasure in assuring you of my particular respect and consideration—God preserve Y. E.
many years.”

<place-time>MANUELS June 24" 1821.—10 o’clock A. M.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR/ I have this moment received a second letter from Don Jose Callava Governor of Pensacola of the 22" instant”—This letter is on the subject of a despatch under cover to the Governor of East Florida, brought by Don Alva from the Havana.
In your letter to me of the 9" instant,” you apprize me of your arrival at Pensacola “in company with Don Alva the Spanish Commissary for the delivery of the two Provinces.” The Governor in his letter to me of the 10" inst,” apprizes me of his receipt of orders for the delivery of West Florida and its dependencies and his appointment as Commissioner for the delivery of the same. And in his letter of the 22" instant, the Governor states distinctly that Don Alva has no authority but was merely the bearer of the despatches to him—
In your letter to me of the 21" instant,” you style Don Alva “the Spanish despatch Bearer.” In your letter of the 8* instant to the Secretary of State of the United States," John Q. Adams, transmitted through me and to which by your letter of 9" instant I was referred;
you advise him of the sailing of the United States vessel, the Non Such, with Don Aredondo bearer of the order for the delivery of the Province of East Florida, and that Don Alva your Colleague was the sole Commissioner for its delivery.
From these contradictions, and Don Alva's not having reported himself upon his arrival officially either to the Governor of Pensacola or myself; I have to call on you for a report of the arrangements made by you with the Captain General and Governor of Cuba and the Floridas that inclined you to require Captain Reid of the Hornet to order the United States vessel, the Non Such to sail for St Augustine, and what Personage, and what orders and to whom directed, were to go in said vessel the Non Such, by your stipulations, with the Captain General, Governor of Cuba and the Floridas.
From the tenor of the Governor's second letter of the 22" instant, your report on this subject becomes necessary and that I should be
<pb#110 />
furnished with it without delay. You will therefore transmit it as early as possible."

<place-time>MANUEL's 25* June 1821, SIR/I have, but a few minutes since, received your second letter of the 22" instant *—Col Forbes the United States Agent, had instructions from his Government to arrange with the Capt" General of the Cuba's, the mode of transmitting from the Havana, the Royal Order, to the Spanish Commandants or Commissioners for the delivery of the respective Provinces of East and West Florida to the United States Agents authorized to receive them.</place-time>
<docbody>I have been impressed with the belief that under these instructions, Col. Forbes sailed to Pensacola in the United States Sloop of War Hornet, accompanied with Don Alva the bearer of despatches to Your Excellency, and that at the same time the United States Gun vessel, Non Such was despatched for St Augustine with Don Aredondo, the bearer of the necessary orders to the Governor of East Florida for the delivery of that Province. In consequence of your polite letter, I
have this day called upon Col. Forbes for an unequivocal report on this subject,” and should it be made to appear in the least doubtful whether the Capt. General of Cuba's order has been transmitted to the Governor of East Florida, I will then endeavor to concert with you some arrangements for the safe conveyance of the Package, committed to the charge of Don Alva.
I have no means at my command at present for transmitting despatches to St Augustine, but will probably charter a suitable vessel to convey a Messenger to that place, so soon as a definite day is agreed upon for the delivery of West Florida. By this conveyance, should one be obtained, any despatches you may wish to transmit will be safe, or any Messenger you wish to send will be accommodated.
I remain with great respect. Your most Obdt Servt.

<docbody>SIR, The President having appointed you to be Secretary in and for East Florida with the exception of that part which lies westward of the Cape, to reside at St. Augustine," and it not being possible for me to attend personally to the duties assigned me as Governor, of East and West Florida; I have thought proper to give you all the powers, heretofore exercised by the Gov' of East Florida over the same; subject to such limitations as are specified in the commission vesting you, and to my instructions from the President of the United States, a part of which are contained in my third commission" from him, a copy of which is enclosed for your Government—Enclosed also, is a copy of a letter from the Secretary of State, Mr Adams, of date 22" of May
1821,” and an extract of a letter from him of date 23" of May 1821,”
for your instruction and Government. I would send you the act of Congress of the 3" of March 1821; ” but I have but one copy, and you will find it in the newspapers—by which you will also be regulated—
From the tenor of my Commission, and the extract from the Secretaries letter of May 23" which has been noticed as enclosed; It appears that all officers in the Territories not appointed by the President, are to be appointed and distributed by me. The President not having appointed a clerk for the court of the U States for the District of East Florida, it follows that that clerk is to be appointed by me; when you see the Judge you will confer with him on the subject, and if he is not specially instructed to appoint a clerk, you will appoint and commission one for his court. I enclose you an application, made to me by the Honble John H. Eaton, for a M. Sevier, for your consideration.
I leave to your discretion and judgement the appointment and suspension of all officers within the Territory assigned to you, which the public good may seem to you require, with the exception always of such as may be appointed by the President, reporting promptly the circumstances and your proceedings therein to me.
Reports relative to the actual state of the Government of the Territory assigned to you, with such alterations as you may think adviseable;
you will make to me without delay, in order that you may receive further instructions respecting the same; and also all other information which you may think will tend to promote the interest and happiness

This officer, has also, been directed, to remain at Montpelier, for the preservation, of the public buildings, (which are valuable, and will command a handsome price, if sold) until the pleasure of the War Dept shall be made known, on that subject.

<place-time>PENSACOLA 25th June 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I had the honor of acquainting you on the 9th instant” of my arrival here on that day and of my having given immediate notice by express to General Jackson at Montpelier and instantly after, explained as p my letter of 10th instant (Copy herewith ") to Governor Callava the digression of the Captain General in giving an order to him to deliver the province of West Florida to me, while that for East Florida was as it ought to be to the constituted authority of the U. S. to which he very promptly returned an answer also enclosed"
by which he recognized General Jackson as that authority—
This was the more necessary as the General might otherwise have construed my acquiescence in such an order as an improper assumption on my part He has however done me the justice of attributing my Conduct to the proper motive, that of avoiding the delay to which the smallest objection on my part to the order would have subjected our Government, if made at that moment on the eve of S Ferdinand and other holydays I took an early opportunity of assigning to the General my reasons and added that under such circumstances rather than submit to a farther delay I would have preferred embarking with the semblance of an order for a Country virtually ceded on the 22” February considering that form must yield to substance and that such an order in the General's hands would command prompt and general Compliance The important subject of the orders for possession having been thus disposed of to the satisfaction I hope of the departm" as well as that of General Jackson, it becomes my duty, Sir, to return to the Archives, which I considered as secondary from embracing more particularly the interests of Spanish Grantees, which the Government of the U. S. feel disposed to protect only upon it's established principles of Justice
<pb#114 />
From the Correspondence with the Governor of Cuba" which I had the honor of submitting to you, it would have been perceived that as long as the plea of assorting and preparing the Archives was left open, the road to delay became more trodden and weeks might have succeeded others without any other result than the one which is known to you—It had been insinuated to me that the loss of certain papers taken on the 8” September 1818 by a patriot privateer from the American Schooner Peggy having on board Governor Massot"
from Pensacola, was considered as convenient only to some of the public Acountants now presumption affords grounds that their detraction has been extended to other objects I had heard that Capt" Pintado" the Surveyor of West Florida was in possession of several plans relating to that province and called upon him to ascertain their importance, but after several interviews, in which more art and mystery than Candor were exhibited on his part, I found that he considered the papers as his private property, and told the Governor so, and that if I wanted them for our Government, they must be paid for, at a price which he would not name & which were not in my opinion worth paying for as he observed that a Surveyor in New Orleans had made $20,000 for those of Louis"
I have ascertained that he has been most liberally paid for his public services by grants of Land & Water Lots which his plans demonstrate in too glaring Colors

<docbody>SIR. Captain Call did me the honor of handing to me on the afternoon of yesterday and in the evening Your Excellency's letters of
23** 24” and instant," in reply I beg leave to state, That on my first interview with the Captain General of Cuba &", I was told, that I should have prompt despatch, and be the sole bearer of the orders to the Governors of the Floridas respectively, who were to be Commissioners for their delivery.
Three weeks afterwards I received a note from the Captain General under date of 16" May (now enclosed), notifying me of Don Pedro De Alba's being charged with the Despatches to that effect, and requiring any aid necessary for that purpose.
Upon my repeatedly urging the Capt General, to give me at once, the order for East Florida, that I might send it there by an Officer from the Hornet, in some vessel bound North, which I had in view to engage, I was told, that he would despatch it by a Spanish Merchantman offered to him, I objected to this mode of conveyance as quite inexpedient; while this negotiation was pending the United States Schooner Non Such arrived and presented a desirable conveyance which I offered to the Governor, when he appointed contrary to my expectation, Don Aredondo the Auditor of War to proceed with said order, of which he notified me by letter of 26" May,” also enclosed.
In my despatch of 9th instant to the Secretary of State," I said that upon farther conversation with Don Alba, I find that he alone is charged with the delivery of East Florida, but this does not appear to have any other foundation than his assertion, which is not supported, by reference to his letter of Appointment shewn to me since Your Excellency suggested a doubt, and from which, I styled him in my note the Despatch Bearer only.
11 Acknowledged post, p. 213.
<pb#116 />
Thus, I hope, that Your Excellency will perceive from this exposition and its enclosures that the Public service will not sustain any injury from the misapprehension induced by Don Alba's assertion or the digressions of the Captain General.
I beg leave also to refer to Captain Call for a conversation had with him on this subject and to remain with much respect—

SIR/ I am apprized of the Credentials which you presented me from James Monroe, President of the United States of America dated at Washington on the 14" March of the present year, containing the Second Article of the Treaty of Amity, settlement of differences and limits, concluded on the 22" of February, 1819, between said United States and His Catholic Majesty; and that in virtue of the Royal Order of His Catholic Majesty for the due execution of the terms stipulated being delivered by His Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to be transmitted to me, said President has authorized you as Agent and Commissary of the same United States to deliver to me the Royal order referred to, which I have received, in order that I may settle and concert with you, conformably to the annexed instructions which have been committed to you, about the execution of the above mentioned stipulations, and that the respective documents and Archives with every thing relating to them as expressed in the credentials aforesaid, may be delivered to you by me and by all others who may be in possession of them.
Relatively to this matter, and to the prescription of the 2" Article, I enclose you a Copy of the Royal Order communicated to this Government and Captaincy General on the 12" September 1783 by the then Minister of Indian Affairs of His Catholic Majesty and by the Count de Aranda at Versailles on the 19" of the same month and year, the day of the Exchange of Ratification between their Catholic and Brittanic Majesties; that Royal Order containing the 5", 7", and
10th Articles of the definitive Treaty of Peace, concluded at said Versailles on the 3" day of Said September, and being the authentic document which has been found in this Archive relative to His Catholic Majesty's property in the Floridas, to which the above 2"
Article in the Treaty for their cession refers.
<pb#117 />
In the Year 1819 there were transmitted to this place from West Florida sundry boxes of papers from that Archive, which were in disorder and without indexes; it is therefore an operation requiring some time, to examine if those papers include any other documents relative to the property in question; this however will in time be ascertained.
With regard to East Florida, where all its Archives ought to be found, I send a letter to the Governor, to the end that, being charged by me with the important commission of making a formal delivery to you of that Province, he may make a similar delivery of the documents relative to its property; I give the same instructions to the Commandant of West Florida who is equally charged with the aforesaid commission relatively to that Province.
I must apprize you in fine that as Don Pedro de Alva, Post Master in Pensacola, and Comptroller of its Military Hospital, is at this time on his return to that destination, I charge him from the confidence which he merits I should place in him, with conveying the duplicate Orders for the delivery of West Florida to the hands of its Commandant; I further give him in charge to proceed thence with the Orders to East Florida, and there execute the same commission.
I bring this to your knowledge with a view to the assistance which it may be necessary for you to furnish him in the discharge of his functions.
God preserve You many Years.

<docbody>CO' ROBERT BUTLER
SIR, I have received your letter of the 20" ultimo," and it affords me great pleasure to be informed of you safe arrival at Fernandina and your preparation to visit the Governor of East Florida-
From the date of the sailing of the U States vessel the Non-Such from the Havanna to St Augustine, with Don Aredondo bearer of the order of the Captain General and Governor of Cuba to the Governor of East Florida for the delivery of the same—she could not have reached St Augustine before the 13 instant. She was to sail from the Havanna the day after the Hornet sailed from thence to Pensacola and the Hornet only arrived on the evening of the 9" instant, since
17 LC (Jackson Papers, Vol. 59).
301867-57-8
<pb#118 />
which I have not lost a moment in preparation for the possession of the country ceded. I would have been in possession by this time had it not been for the unfortunate loss of one of our Transports, and the unfavorable weather which has detained the vessel since chartered at Orleans and the transport sent for the garrison of St Marks; as soon as they arrive possession will be had.—I hope my two letters by mail have reached you—they will have advised you of the causes and reasons, why I did not communicate to you by express at a more early day then the present.
The want of a vessel to transport Co" Gadsden has detained him some time to my great regret—He will give you a copy of my commission authorising me to take possession of the country ceded, with the powers to appoint others under me; * this may become necessary, because of Co' Forbes having been viewed by the Captain General, the Commissioner to receive East Florida, and from a fear that Gen.'
Gaines may not have committed the copy to you, which was furnished him. From Co Gadsden you will also receive Blanks signed by me to be filled with such sums or bills on the Department of State, as may be necessary to cover the expense of taking possession of that part of the country ceded—You will receive the Proclamations necessary to be made public on receiving possession of the country, which you will promulgate as soon as you receive the country, or if in possession as soon as you receive them. I send by Co. Gadsden a form of a Process verbal which will be proper and necessary to be signed by the Commissary of Spain appointed to deliver the country, and yourself: to which it will be necessary to add after islands “including all the Tortugas,” that thereafter no dispute may arise with regard to the right to them—You will receive also the form of an agreement entered into preparatory to the delivery of the country, which if you receive in time will be well for you to adopt, that we may have all things uniform in this transaction.
In my last I informed you that some difficulties had arisen with respect to the Artillery appertaining to the Fortifications ceded—You will receive information of the course pursued by me here, and acceded to by the Governor of Pensacola, which it will be proper for you to adopt if Co' Gadsden reaches you in time—
Finding that the President of the United States has appointed a Secretary for East as well as West Florida, (as it appears from instructions) to aid me in the Government of the whole, and to keep up the same distinction which existed under the Spanish Government;
<pb#119 />
I have thought proper by Commission to clothe M* Worthington "
with all the powers exercised by the Governor of East Florida under the rule of Spain–Co Gadsden is the bearer of this commission and all the necessary instructions to him on this important subject: When you have received the Archives with the possession of the country and proclaimed the same, you will hand over to M' Worthington the commission and instructions with the Archives taking his receipt for the same, and charge him with the administration of the Government as confided to him by me—Having performed this with all the other duties confided to you by me—having settled all public accounts and taken duplicate receipts for the same; you will repair to Pensacola in the vessel that carries Co Gadsden to you, or by land, and make a report to me of all the matters and things over which you have had charge; that agreeably to my instructions I may make a report to my Government, and close all accounts that have accrued in taking possession of and occupying the Floridas—
I am with great respect Your Most Obt Servant

<docbody>ANDREW JACKSON Esquire Governor of Florida SIR I have had the honour of receiving your Letters of 24 April *
1.” 7.* 19.” 23* and 30 May,” with their enclosures.
The conduct of the Governor and Captain General of the Island of Cuba, in delaying without any apparent satisfactory reason, the
<pb#120 />
delivery of the orders to the Governors of East & West Florida, for the evacuation of those Provinces, by the Officers and Troops of Spain and in evading the delivery of all of the Archives in his possession, and which by a stipulation of the Treaty were to be given up, appears to have been very exceptionable.
The President has been disposed to make every allowance for the dilatory character of all transactions habitual to the officers of the Spanish Government. On receiving your Letter of the 19. May; he had thought it would be necessary to take measures on a presumption that the unwaritable delays of the Governor of Cuba would be still continued; which under other circumstances it would be very desirable to avoid—While these measures however were under consideration, intillegence was received from Col. Forbes, that he had at length received the orders for the delivery of the two Provinces, and immediately afterwards, that he had actually sailed from the Havanna on the 30
ult” for Pensacola. As the order to the Governor of St Augustine, had been dispatched on the same day, and that order was received by him of the 7. instant, we are in daily expectation of receiving the information, that that place has been delivered up to Col Butler, and that the Spanish Officers and Troops there have embarked for the Havanna.
The tenor of your correspondence with the Governor of Pensacola as well as the character heretofore known of Governor Callava have led to the hope and expectation, that he will on receiving the order of evacuation, manifest all the alacrity for carrying the Treaty into execution, which has been professed in his Letters—It was therefore, concluded here that it would be most advisable, to take no step founded on the supposition that unnecessary delays will be still experienced in the evacuation of the Floridas, even after the orders for their evacuation shall have been received by the Governors of the respective Provinces.
Your Letters of the 23 and 30 Ult” have been forwarded to the President who is in Loudoun; I shall inform you as soon as possible of his directions on your suggestion of a wish to be furnished with a Check on the Branch Bank at New Orleans.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to state you that the U.S. troops this day at 4 ock P. M. received from the Spanish authorities this post, and that your orders on this subject are fully complied with.
I forward you duplicate receipts for the Fort and also Invoices of the the Ordnance, Ammunition &c left by the Spaniards here and which is said to be claimed both by Spain & the U. States—All the latter articles receipted for are totally unfit for service—
I request that you will despatch one of the public vessels to Fort Gadsden to transport to this place the two 18 pounders & 2 of six now there also Ammunition &c—
I deemed it proper to move from F* Gadsden all the men that were able to march except a Lieut & eighteen—as sick left there are about thirty in number—
I hope you may think proper to direct Col. Arbuckle” to relieve all the men of this command now at Fort Gadsden I marched the troops by land and arrived here four days before the Shields—The Shields not arriving until yesterday was the cause of the delay—
Pardon me if I again say that we are much in want of a vessel for the transportation of many important effects and also of the men that we were compelled to leave at F* Gadsden.

SIR, In the absence of the P. M. G. I have received your letter of the 19th.”—I have directed a mail to be sent from St Mary's to St.
Augustine and it is supposed by the Secretary of State that the possession has been delivered, but the fact is not known. It would be useful therefore to have the Post Office put in immediate operation, which you perhaps may have done by writing to some acquaintance there. Blanks, &" will be forwarded to you at that place.—
There is no compensation provided for the P. M. other than a commission on the amount of money passing through his hands.—There are several instances where Post Masters are specially provided for—
this was done when the post-office funds exceeded its expenses. which is far from the case at this time—and it is not therefore probable that any extra allowance will be made *

<docbody>SIR I have received Y. E. note of yesterday,” in which you decline for the present appointing a day for the exchange of flags. And desiring that the Captains of the vessels I have freighted to transport
<pb#123 />
the Stores should be required to come forward to receive their loading as that part of the business was delayd; I deem it necessary to remark to Y. E. that the Sloop Endeavour was procured for that purpose, and required to report for your orders—And in a conversation had with you some days since you were pleased to remark, that should this vessel not be sufficient to transport those stores, you would dispose of the overplus in your vessels. In a subsequent conversation you were pleased to signify that one vessel would not be sufficient and alledging that no passengers would go on board of the Endeavor in consequence of her loading being principally powder, upon which I informed you that I would procure another vessel to take the ballance of the stores
& to accomodate passengers—I have procured the promised vessel and she will be ready to receive her freight early in the morning. You are pleased to inform me that the shipment of the Artillery altho progressing as fast as possible might be delayed by a change of weather;
And as I observe also, that but few of your balls &c have been put on board of your vessels, I feel some what at a loss to understand, how any delay could have arisen on my part—I have deemed the foregoing observations necessary to exonerate me from any imputation of neglect of duty on the part of my government, which your note is calculated to warrant. In answer to that part of Y. E. note which relates to the allowance of a gratuity of thirty days at two dollars per day, on the part of your government to the officers for their passage to the Havana, I can only remark that my instructions confine me to the furnishing provisions under certain conditions; and that those provisions will be placed in the possession of Your Commissary, subject to such disposition as you may think proper to make of them. I appreciate Y.

<docbody>SIR. That a more perfect understanding should exist between us in relation to the Archives which are embraced in the treaty of cession and relating to individual property is the object of this communication.
I should upon mature reflection, consider myself wanting in my duty to the inhabitants of this province, who are about to become citizens of my government, if I with held any statement in relation to the Archives, which might lead to the removal of any documents that would be of importance to their security, and which my government considers included in the treaty. The following records are deemed indispensible to this Object. Viz the royal or other orders authorising the Gov” of this province to issue grants to individuals for land, lotts, or squares. The evidence of indemnity offered by G. Britain to her subjects who might leave their property in this province and retire to her territory after the cession to Spain. The proclamation of the Spanish authorities calling on those individuals, to come forward and dispose of their property or peacably occupy it within certain periods or the same would be confiscated; and the order of confiscation thereafter. The original records of all grants made in the province either by his C. M. the Cap" Gen" of Cuba or the governors of this province respectively. The original records of all trials and decisions embracing individual property, and the original records relating to the execution of wills, and administration of estates. The foregoing explanation is given to shew you, what I am bound to consider as the Archives relating to individual proper and which are not to be removed from this place until the decision is had on the subject by
<pb#126 />
our respective governments; and I request that you will cause the Cap' Gen' to be furnished with a copy of this communication. I have the honor to remain with perfect respect & Great Consideration ROB" BUTLER.

- PENSACOLA AND BARRANCAS
<source>[LC: Jackson Papers, Lets. and Orders, Bk. M]</source>
<place-time>- HEAD QUARTERS, Manuels 10* July 1821</place-time>
ORDERS, The 4* Reg' of Infantry and the company of Artillery, under the command of Col George M. Brooke, will take up the line of march on the morning of the 11" instant and proceed to Galvez Spring in the vicinity of Pensacola, where they will be encamped and held in readiness for the occupation of Pensacola and Barrancas in a moments warning.
No Soldier will be permitted to enter Pensacola unless in company with a commissioned officer—Order and sobriety must be observed by the Soldiery—the smallest deviation from the rules of discipline and subordination will receive the most exemplary punishment: but the Governor flatters himself that the American soldiers will not degrade themselves and their country, either by intoxication or any other irregularity of deportment, whilst taking possession of the ceded Territory.
Co' Brooke will detail and organise the Garrisons intended for Pensacola and Barrancas, the former to consist of not less than four companies of Infantry. The officer detailed for the command and taking possession of Barrancas, will hold in readiness twenty select men commanded by a confidential Subaltern to relieve the Spanish Troops of equal number at Barrancas, where the following ceremonies will be observed.—At a certain hour hereafter to be made known this detachment will enter the fortress of Barrancas, where it will find a Spanish guard of one Lieutenant and Twenty men formed at supported arms fronting the Flag staff—the United States Troops will form in front of them with the Flag staff between them—The Spanish Flag being hoisted, the American Flag will be fastened to the same Haliards—The American Flag will then ascend and the Spanish Flag descend, until meeting at half mast—they will remain in that position until a Spanish salute of twenty-one guns is fired. So soon as the last gun is fired, the American Flag will ascend to the top of the mast, and the Spanish Flag will be taken down by the Spanish officer—The American and Spanish Troops will then salute each other by presenting arms, and continue at a present until the Spanish officer delivers to the Officer of the U. States The order of Don Jose Callava the Spanish commandant for the delivery of the fortress of Barrancas, at which the Troops will be ordered to shoulder arms—the Spanish Troops are to withdraw, and those of the U States to remain in possession of the fortification, and will be prepared to salute their Flag with twenty-five rounds from the Guns in Battery in said fortification.
<pb#129 />
Until the foregoing ceremony is concluded the balance of the American Troops will remain without the Fortification, but to enter as soon as it is concluded—
Co! Brooke will hold the detachment at Pensacola in readiness to hoist the American flag on hearing the last gun of the Spanish salute at Barrancas, and so soon as the process verbal” for the delivery of the country is signed, the American flag in Pensacola will be hoisted, and after half mast high, going up, will be saluted with 25 guns—

PROCLAMATION BY COMMISSIONER AND GOVERNOR
JACKSON
[Vignoles, Observations upon the Floridas:Pr."]
[July 10, 1821]
Proclamation By Major General Andrew Jackson, Governor of the provinces of the Floridas, exercising the powers of the Captain General and of the Intendant of the island of Cuba, over the said provinces, and of the Governors of said provinces, respectively.
Whereas, by the treaty concluded between the United States and Spain, on the 22d day of February, 1819, and duly ratified, the provinces of the Floridas were ceded by Spain to the United States, and the possession of the said provinces is now in the United States:
And whereas, the Congress of the United States, on the 3d of March, in the present year, did enact, that, until the end of the first session of the seventeenth Congress, unless provision for the temporary government of said provinces be sooner made by Congress, all the military, civil and judicial powers exercised by the officers of the existing government of the said provinces, shall be vested in such persons and shall be exercised in such manner, as the President of the United States shall direct, for the maintaining the inhabitants of said territories in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion: and the President of the United States has, by his commission, bearing date the
10th day of said March,” invested me with all the powers, and charged me with the several duties, heretofore held and exercised by the Captain General, Intendant, and Governors aforesaid:
I have, therefore, thought fit to issue my proclamation, making known the premises, and to declare that the government heretofore exercised over the said provinces, under the authority of Spain, has ceased, and that that of the United States of America is established over the same: that the inhabitants thereof will be incorporated in the Union of the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the federal constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of all the privileges, rights, and immunities, of the citizens of the United States; that in the mean time they shall be protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and the religion they profess, that all laws and municipal regulations which were in existence at the cessation of the late government, remain in full force: and all civil officers, charged with their execution, except those whose powers have been specially vested in me, and except, also, such officers as have been entrusted with the collection of the revenue, are continued in
<pb#131 />
their functions during the pleasure of the governor for the time being or until provision shall otherwise be made.
And I do hereby exhort and enjoin all the inhabitants and other persons within the said provinces, to be faithful and true in their allegiance to the United States, and obedient to the laws and authorities of the same, under full assurance that their just rights will be under the guardianship of the United States, and will be maintained from all force and violence from without or within.

<docbody>SIR. The province of East Florida was yesterday, happily delivered over and occupied by the authorities of the United States—
<pb#133 />
On that morning previous to the delivery I had the satisfaction of receiving the proclamations of the Governor from Pensacola by Co'
Gadsden: and which were promulgated after the exchange of flags—
The governor informs me that he expected to occupy West Florida about the 10" ins' should this be the case, it will add to the surprize which I experienced on receiving his communication, to find the remarkable coincidence in the manner and issue of our respective duties—
I shall leave this place for Pensacola on the 16" inst: under the Governors orders, and shall forward you in the meantime a copy of the correspondence which has ensued during my stay here in the exercise of my duties.
I consider it proper to apprize you that not one of the civil officers appointed by the President has yet arrived except the Marshall; this circumstance renders it encumbent on the officer Cap" J. R. Bell who will receive the government to appoint temporarily such officers as will be necessary for the customs. Owing to the non arrival of the provisions destined to subsist the Spanish troops to the Havana, I
directed a purchase to be made by an assistant Commissary of subsistence, and agreeably to the regulations of that department, he draws direct on the cheif for the amount; and I shall accompany with letters of advice.
I shall probably draw for a small amount direct on you to enable me to pay the accounts which I have personally contracted, and bear my expences to Pensacola for the final arrangement of my appointment—From the plans & Inventories which I shall submit to the Governor, he will be enabled to report to you fully on the subject of the public property in this quarter. I have succeeded in obtaining all the cannon which was in battery on the forts, subject however to the decision of the two governments: I claiming as a right under the treaty: and Governor Coppinger disclaiming on the part of his government. The provisions furnished &c are similarly placed in consequence of the disavowal of the right to the Artillery.
There have been several peices of Artillery removed—Viz feild Artillery, and those belonging to the Gun boats, but in the Governors own transports. I shall be much gratified to receive an acknowledgment of the documents by Major Cross, and that my services have been approved.

The Archives relating to private property are so numerous that it would be an endless task to have them transcribed & I therefore claimed them as they were, and I deemed it of great importance to particularize, as you will find from my letter of the 3" Inst." & numbered 26—owing to my receiving information that a large portion of these documents were packed for transportation-This letter had the effect of keeping all the documents here until your decision is made with the Spanish authorities.—
The documents are forwarded by maj. Cross on the part of the Spanish Commissioner to the minister at Washington, from which you will be enabled to settle the points left open with him speedily.
I shall be gratified to receive a communication from you; if my services in this instance has corresponded with the interests of my country-
As I have not been informed of what allowance will be authorized, as a compensation for the duty which I have performed; will you be kind enough to give me the necessary information on this subject directed to Pensacola.—

<docbody>Private or unofficial SIR Although my official duties have permitted a correspondence with you, I have not before asked leave to make any confidential communications to you, yet in justice to my personal & family obligations to you I feel warranted in doing it if my own Conception of duty prescribes the occasion to me as fit After an interview with the Governor at the Camp when he received me very well, H. Eshewed me the list of appointments among which I observed my name, when he remarked that unless there was a Salary, the appointment would not give me Salt for my Herrings, I
intimated, that something perhaps within his own appointment not incompatible with my national duties, might bring my knowlege of the Spanish into use for the public, I was informed, that it was very uncertain what local appointment if any was to be made and that he had transferred all his powers to the Secretary of E. F
Having perceived some coolness and apparent dissatisfaction among many expectants on the Spot, I felt much mortification at some remarks which were made of the selection of Judges, & other officers, * No order of July 14, 1821 found, but one of June 14 concerning the enforcement of discipline and the administration of justice by senior officers is in NA (WD, West. Dept., Order Bk.).
<pb#138 />
perhaps including myself, I therefore Considered that my longer Stay would be as useless to Government, as unpleasant to myself-
On my arrival here, I was introduced to the Sub Commissioner, upon whom I called, and was received, as the other Citizens who had waited upon him, without farther notice, than that of the moment, while the Spanish Governor had pointedly returned every visit which had been made to him—
This alienation from his Countrymen would have been quite unimportant in point of etiquette, (altho in a Country partaking of the Spanish), if the municipal appointments had not been continued contrary to the expectation of the present incumbents, (the old residents,)
and the natural feeling of the new, who have manifested extreme soreness, at being subject, not only, to Spanish laws quite undefined and practically unknown in this province, but to the administration of those laws, by men not recognized as Citizens of the U.S.-
With the ordinary feeling of the Americans an opportunity soon presented itself, a negro Boy claimed by a Citizen of Georgia as a Runaway, sought protection under a Certificate of freedom signed by a man purporting to be the agent of the Master & acknowleged before the Escribano, but this instrument was disavowed by the testimony in Court, of said Agent (Palisier) The Case was argued before the Alcalde by several Lawyers of the U.S. say Georgia, on behalf of the Citizen who contended that the Court was unconstitutional, and that the Alcalde had no jurisdiction, while the latter maintained that the evidence by the Escribano's Certificate was conclusive, the Cause was adjourned twice, at which violent arguments were held and a farther adjournment until Monday 16th has been made, thus the wide door of party distinction has been opened, and what name or Character it is to assume, I know not, but shall use my utmost exertions on the arrival of the Secretary to stop it in the bud-
I avail myself of this occasion to know whether on accepting my Commission of Marshall, I shall not consider myself as the Guardian of such public property as is not specially entrusted to the Care of particular departments including Wrecks and their proceeds.—
I shall have the honor of addressing you again as anything important Occurs.
I am with great respect Sir Your most Obedient & very faithful Servant JAMES G. FORBES

The meeting broke up without passing any resolutions, thus making their Separation a source of congratulation to the old residents who felt uneasy at the Course adopted of expressing public opinion in a manner to them unknown The Indians have appeared in small numbers in town since the Change and are desirous of knowing whether any provision has been made for them in the treaty, They are Seminoles and say they apprehend some disturbance with the Cowetas These last are said to have been at Tampa about 200 strong and taken from thence about

<docbody>SIR On the eleventh inst. I received from Col. R. Butler the Commissioner on the part of the United States for taking possession of the Province of East Florida under the late treaty with Spain, a commission from Gen.' Andrew Jackson Governor of the Floridas authorising me provisionally to perform all the duties of the Secretary of the Province until the arrival of M Worthington who has been appointed by the President of the United States, and vesting in me all the powers civil and military that was before exercised by the late Spanish Governor Don Jose Coppinger.”
By the proclamation of Gen' Jackson,” the civil officers appointed or elected under the Spanish Government are retained in office—
Spanish laws and authorities under the Spanish Constitution to be obeyed respected and enforced; in this there will be some discontents who are from the States as ignorant of all law as they are destitute of good principal and common honesty.
M Rodman appointed collector by the President not having arrived, M. George Gibbs has been provisionally appointed—Of which information will be given to the Secretary of the Treasury—I have also appointed Don F. J. Fatio translator and interpreter, a copy of which I enclose;” this gentleman's services cannot be dispensed with as most of the public documents and papers are written in the Spanish
<pb#145 />
language which is also the language most used in the common transaction of business—I wished to be informed if this appointment is approved and what will be the compensation allowed for his services—
I have also to ask, if any remuneration will be made to me for additional expences in quarters, clerk hire, Stationary and other extras consequent to my situation as acting Governor of the Province.”—
A Captains pay, will not go far in payment of absolute and necessary expences.”—

<docbody>SIR. Before the receipt of this you will have been informed of the exchange of Flags at this place on the 10" Inst.” on the 11* I received from Col Butler the commissioner on the part of the United States, a commission from Gen.' Andrew Jackson Governor of the Floridas, by which I am provisionally vested with all the powers and authorities heretofore exercised by Don Jose Coppinger Governor of the Province of East Florida,” until the arrival of M Worthington duly appointed Secretary by the President of the United States—
Col Butler left here on the 14" for Pensacola, the Spanish fleet of transports for the Havana sailed yesterday under convoy of the United States Schooner Porpoise Capt Ramage, the late Governor Coppinger remains here for some time as Spanish Commissioner—
Maj. Cross Sailed in a Schooner this morning bound for Philadelphia accompanied by Lieut Wells" of the Army ordered to Pittsburgh—
via Washington City.—No civil or military officers who have been appointed or arranged to this Station have yet arrived.—
The Fort and public buildings are in a rapid state of delapidation, to arrest the hand of ruin and to occupy some of them, I have given orders to Lieut Washburn,” to immediately cause a coat of cement to be laid on the Terrace of the fort which will prevent the water from washing through the masonry, into the Barrack rooms and stores;
<pb#146 />
to furnish lime sufficient for whitewashing the walls inside and out, and to furnish materials for laying floors and making bunks also to have temporally repaired the Government house for officers quarters, there being none suitable for that purpose at present in the fort—I
have also drawn on him for Stores & provisions for a small party of Indians that came in yesterday of the Seminole tribe.
They appear to be a wretched, miserable Set—Their chief business was to be introduced to the new Governor and to inform him, that very recently a party of Indians (Cawetus)* Said to be headed by M*Intosh * came into their neighbourhood and had taken off a Considerable number of negroes and some Indians, that the commander of the party had sent them information that in a short time he should return and drive all the Indians off. Similar information I received last evening from another source—not being apprised of any authorised movement of the kind on the part of the United States, or Gen' Jackson, I have concluded that when that party returns, should I not receive information for my Government on the subject that I would send out an armed force to know from the leader his authority, and if he has none from the Government or Gen"
Jackson to immediately to put a stop to his proceedings at the same time secure what runaway negroes we can and keep them in Safety to be given up to their real owners when properly identified—I am also informed that a french gentleman" has been on the S" Johns river styling himself an authorised agent of the United States to explore the Country & to hold talks with the Indians, him I shall take measures thro’ the Alcalde to have brought before me.
In making expenditures I shall have a due regard to economy, but I fear they will be somewhat blended as they should fall under most of the heads of the Quarter Masters, Engineers, Subsistence, ordnance, clothing & Indian departments—It shall be our endeavour to keep them so separated as that on their being presented for Settlement, they will with your approbation be passed to the credit of the Act" Quarter Master."

I also enclose you blanks with my Signature, for as many Officers as will be necessary to carry into effect and execution the Government as organized by the different Ordinances above mentioned.
The Ordinance incorporating the Town of St Augustine does not specify its limits, as you will discover from the 4* Section, which relates to this subject, this was omitted from a want of information relative to the local situation of the place, and you are authorized to conclude the 4* Section, by giving to the Town such incorporated limits, as in your judgement will be most conducive to its convenience and prosperity.
I have given the appointment of Sheriff for the County of St Johns to Capt" Hannum" late of the Army, by whom this will be delivered.—
I have offered the appointment of Clerk of the County Court to Major Willis,” late of the Army provided he should reach you in due time. I have enclosed this commission blank that in case he should not arrive in time for the first Session of the Court, that it may be filled with the name of some other person qualified to perform the duties, but should he join you in time for the organization of the Court, the Commission will be given to him.—The appointment of all other Officers provided for in the different Ordinances, I have left to your own discretion having no doubt, but in all your selections you will alone consult, the good, the happiness and security of the People of East Florida—I enclose you a Commission of Marshall of
1* These ordinances were promulgated by Worthington at St. Augustine, Aug.
20, 1821, in a pamphlet printed by Richard W. Edes, publisher of the Fla. Gazette, with the title: Ordinances, by Major-General Andrew Jackson, Governor of the Provinces of the Floridas, Exercising the Powers of the Captain-General, and of the Intendant of the Island of Cuba, over the Said Provinces, and of the Governors of Said Provinces Respectively. The pamphlet was reproduced photographically in 1939 by the Library of Congress from a copy in its collections which was once owned by John Rodman, collector of the customs at St. Augustine, and again by the John Calhoun Club (Chicago, 1941), in facsimile under the editorship of Douglas C. McMurtrie. The ordinances were also published contemporaneously in the Fla. Gazette, issues of Sept. 1, Sept. 8, and Sept. 15, 1821. See also post, p. 180.
” This appointment went to James R. Hanham, a former captain in the U. S.
Army, rather than to Washington L. Hannum, who had been appointed prosecuting attorney of W. Fla. Hanham was still filling the position of sheriff of St.
Johns County in 1823 (St. Augustine, E. Fla. Herald, June 14, 1823). W. L.

Forbes for the faithful discharge of his duties—When you deliver him the Commission you will comply with the instructions contained in the letter, by which you will be regulated as to the amount of the Security to be required.
I have only to add on this subject, that the Marshall's situation may be such as to have large sums of money in his hands, belonging to both the Gov" and to individuals, and the security should be such, as to give perfect security to all and particularly to individuals.
I trust ere this reaches you, Col. Butler will have received possession of East Florida and its dependencies” and that he has turned over the Government to you with my instructions, sent by Col Gadsden on board the U. S. Schooner Revenge which sailed from this Port on the 1* instant*—
I have the pleasure to inform you that on the 17" instant at 10

nothing has occurred worthy your notice, I therefore confined myself to the bare enclosure of the last Newspaper, I now beg leave to add that of the day (yesterday)*—
I regret to state that none of the Civil officers have yet appeared, notwithstanding which the irritability on the part of some of the Citizens of the U.S. has subsided and the public feeling of the old Inhabitants more inclined to harmonize—the establishment of a Species of Tribunal Composed of Military & Civil members having tended to awe the disorderly and give Confidence to the peaceable Inhabitants—
The Case of the Slave referred to in my last respects is still in suspence but the Conduct of the Citizen of Georgia has been highly disgraceful and reprehensible Owing to the evacuation by the Spaniards a void is very perceptible which has not yet been repaired by any arrivals and the King's allowance scanty as it was is strongly and sensibly felt, Those Coming in being of a needy and Speculative character neither affording releif or deriving encouragement in the present miserable State of the Province almost inundated by Constant rains and without Commerce or such products as can create it immediately *

informed you of my arrival at that place, of my disappointment in not hearing from the Hornet of my despatching Mess" Brackenridge and Bronaugh with a letter to Governor Callava, and of my communication with Montpelier. I had with confidence calculated on the arrival of the Hornet by the first of May, and from a knowledge of the habitual apathy of Spanish functionaries, I thought it advisable even before the arrival of the Hornet, to announce my commission to the Spanish Governor of West Florida, and after offering to exhibit the royal order and my commission for receiving the country, to ask information upon certain points, which would tend to expedite and facilitate subsequent arrangements. From his letter which has also been forwarded it will be seen that he declined to comply with my request; but I am well satisfied that this early step had a favorable operation upon our subsequent transactions. It drew from him, a promise that the surrender of the Country should not be delayed by him, in case he should be the person commissioned for the purpose, and I think it not improbable, that this measure had also some effect with the Captain General of Cuba. I had rec" intimations both at New Orleans, and at Blakeley, that speculations were in contemplation, to accomplish which, great pains would be taken by the parties concerned to delay the surrender of the ceded Country, and since that period I have heard it frequently expressed as a matter of surprise that no attempt of the kind had been made, at least in this quarter.
On the return of Mess" Bronaugh and Brackenridge I proceeded to Montpelier having been previously joined by my Aid de Camp Cap'
Call. On the 11" I again addressed a letter to the Governor of West
<pb#158 />
Florida" which I despatched by Capt. Call who was instructed to remain at Pensacola until the arrival of the Hornet, for I still confidently hoped this could not be delayed many days, and also authorised Cap" Call to make any preliminary arrangements with the Governor, which he would be willing to enter into. In my letter to him of the
11" after expressing my regret at his not considering himself authorised to give the information I had asked, I informed him that orders had been given to provide transportation for six hundred men with supplies for their voyage, that the same was then ready, and would sail for Pensacola on the first notification of the receipt of the Royal Order at that place. In doing this my intention was to deprive him of all excuse on the score of his not having had sufficient time to make his preparations for quitting the Country. I had previously informed him of the assurances of the Spanish Minister at Washington, that no delay should be experienced in the surrender of the Floridas, and which I now took occasion to repeat. After stating the unpleasant situation in which the American Troops were placed in the interior, I proceeded to inform him that two public vessels the Shields and the Amelia were then at anchor in Mobile Bay with supplies for Pensacola and St. Marks, and proposed to make a deposit of the supplies intended for our Troops at the former place, and also requested to be informed whether it would meet his wishes to have the Troops of Spain brought from St. Marks to Pensacola, as a preparatory measure to the surrender of the Country, so that all the Spanish officers and Soldiers might sail together under the same convoy. This was intended to render the evacuation more convenient and agreeable to them. I had began to entertain serious doubts of the speedy arrival of the Hornet, and thought that if a preliminary arrangement of this kind could be made, time might be saved. The Governor in his reply of the 16** consented to the proposal of making a deposit of the provisions for the American Troops, approved of the proposal respecting the transportation of the Troops from St. Marks, but denied that he had any power to make any preliminary arrangement or do any act connected with the surrender of the Country until he should have received orders from his superior. The vessels accordingly sailed for Pensacola, and the provisions were placed in deposit at that place. It may be well here to observe, that at a subsequent period, the Governor thought proper to claim the benefit of the proposal to bring the Spanish Troops to this place from St. Marks, although not assented to when made, and was acceded to by me from a wish to deal with him in the most liberal and generous manner, at the same time that I was determined to permit no idle and useless delay.
<pb#159 />
Nearly two weeks elapsed after the departure of Cap" Call, without hearing a word of the Hornet. The anxiety which I experienced can be more readily imagined than expressed. Without speaking of my own situation, and that of my family which was extremely uncomfortable, I began to entertain serious apprehensions that there was no intention to surrender the country before the 22" of August. During this painful state of suspence, many rumors were afloat and how far, well or ill founded, it was impossible for me to say. I was utterly unable to conjecture the cause of the delay of Col: Forbes, it appeared to me that a few days would have sufficed for the transmission of the Royal Order to the Floridas, and I took it for granted that if any considerable delay was likely to be experienced in procuring the archives, a person could be left to receive them, in order to accomplish the more important object of obtaining immediate possession of the ceded territories. On an attentive examination of the stipulations of the Treaty, I was satisfied in my own mind that the seventh Article relating to the transportation of the Spanish officers and Troops, and the evacuation of the places occupied by them, was a different matter from the surrender of the sovereignty of the Country, as stipulated under the Second Article of the Treaty, and for which no specific time was appointed, and therefore to date from the exchange of ratifications.
This construction was confirmed by the stipulations on the subject of duties, by which the twelve years privilege granted to Spain was to commence three months after the ratification; and the provision which under a construction different from that I had given would have been entirely unnecessary, that the duties collected by the Spanish Custom-house Officers from the time of the exchange of ratifications until the surrender, might be retained. The circumstances attending the Treaty, although not appearing on the face of it, I was satisfied ought in good conscience and in truth, to place the date of its ratification on the part of Spain as far back as October last. These wise considerations which I kept in reserve to be acted on only in case of the most urgent necessity, having set out with a determination to carry the Treaty into effect if possible in harmony and good will.
I was also determined on the arrival of the Royal Order, to permit no useless delay, as I conceived that after this, the termination of the business was left to Governor Callava and myself, our respective Governments having confided it to us, and I was determined that on such event, nothing should be wanting on my part.
On the 20"Cap" Call” returned to Montpelier in company with M Thompson * who brought me the first certain information of the
<pb#160 />
Hornet. M Thompson was the bearer of a letter from Col: Forbes”
to which I refer you, which, although far from being satisfactory, together with the assurances of M Thompson that the Hornet would probably have sailed in a few days after his departure from Havanna, served in some measure to remove the uneasiness I had experienced.
I began to entertain a hope that the long expected vessel might at last arrive. In anticipation of this event I addressed a letter to Col:
Gadsden who had shortly before reached Pensacola, and appointed him a confidential agent to reside at that place, and for the purposes expressed in my letter to him of the 21" of May to which I refer you.” Having occason for the services of Col: Gadsden near me, I
transfered his powers to Capt. Call, and was joined by the former at Montpelier. On the 22" I addressed a letter to Major Fanning the officer commanding at Fort Gadsden,” giving the necessary orders for the taking possession and occupation of St. Marks, to which I must also refer you as more fully explanatory of the arrangements made with a view to that operation.
From this period until I addressed you my letter of the 30" of May * I remained at Montpelier in the same uncertainty and with increasing solicitude. Reports reached me that Cap" Reed of the Hornet had fallen a victim to the climate of Havanna, and that the greater part of the crew was unfit for duty. My letter of the ninth of June * will shew the painful anxiety which I felt during this period, not a little heightened by the bad state of my health. I prepared in the mean time, an express to be despatched to St. Augustine with instructions to Col: Butler, and wrote him the letter under date of the 2" of June " to give him the earliest information of events in this quarter—I was apprehensive that the vessels employed to transport the Troops from East Florida would have arrived, and occasion a heavy demurrage, as the same precautions could not well be taken
<pb#161 />
there, as in this quarter, where we were more convenient to the place at which the transports were to be procured.
I had almost given up all hope of the arrival of the Hornet, when at last I was informed by express that she had arrived at Pensacola on the evening of the 9" of June after having been detained six weeks in Havanna for reasons which to me still remain unaccounted for. A
letter from Col: Forbes " was brought by the same express informing me of his arrival at Pensacola in company with Don Alba as commissioner on the part of Spain. I refer you to this letter and to my reply dated the eleventh.” I could not but remark with some surprise that the Order of the Cap" General was for the delivery of West Florida to Col: Forbes as commissioner on the part of the United States, this was owing to a mistake Col: Forbes informs me,” which, although discovered before the sailing of the Hornet, could not be corrected for want of time. The length of time which elapsed from the date of the Order and the sailing of the Hornet, is a circumstance which I must confess I do not clearly understand. It is by no means accounted for, by the delay in procuring the archives; all that could be procured, was a few extracts from the Treaty of '83 between Spain and Great Britain, and which I presume is to be had in any common library. The important papers relating to the grants of Land in this Country, as well as other documents directly relating to the Floridas must still be the subject of negotiation between the respective Governments. I forbear to make any further remark on this head but will refer you to my letter of the
11** sent by Express after my former letter had gone," and also to the communications of Col: Forbes himself.
Without loss of time I addressed the letter of the 12” to Governor Callava," having previously received his communication of the 10**
brought to me by Cap" Call. I expressed my gratification at the promptitude with which he had imparted to me the information he had promised on the arrival of the Hornet, and was pleased with his frankness in waving any advantage of the Order being for the surrender of the Country to M. Forbes. To meet what appeared liberal, with equal liberality, I assented to his request that the Spanish Troops should be brought from St. Marks to be embarked with those at this place. Cap" Call who had been authorised to make the arrangement for the evacuation of S’ Marks had been met by the difficulty antici-
<pb#162 />
pated by you in relation to the construction of the Treaty. The Spanish Governor required a receipt for the cannon and munitions of War left at St. Marks, contending that the former was not included under the term fortification. To his proposal I acceded according to the terms expressed in my letter of the 12* in which I urged all the arguments which then suggested themselves to me to prove the right of the United States under the Second Article of the Treaty. I also brought into view the manner in which the 7" Article was expressed and the liberal construction placed upon it by the President under a belief that a construction equally liberal would be placed by Spain on the one before mentioned; and finally refered him to Captain Call to whom I
had given in my letter of the same date * authority to make a provisional arrangement in case the Governor after the reasons I had given should persist in his construction of the Treaty; this was to receipt for the Cannon on the Forts on condition that receipts should also be given for the transportation furnished for Civil Officers, Servants &c.
and provisions, not provided for by the express letter of the 7*Article.
Giving it, at the same time to be distinctly understood that the United States should by no act of mine be considered as abandoning their right to the Cannon as part of the appendages of the Forts. An inventory of the munitions of War, embraced in their claim was to be taken, and the receipt to specify that they had been received with the Forts, but claimed by the Spanish commissioner as not included in the cession, and to be held by the American agents, subject to any future disposition which might be made by the respective Governments; The Spanish Commissioner to receipt for provisions, transportation of families of Officers, Civil Officers &c. in the same form and the Governor distinctly informed that in case the Spanish Government insisted upon the delivery of the one the U. States would insist upon payment for the other. Capt. Call was also instructed in case this proposed arrangement, should not prove satisfactory, to refuse transportion for every thing not literally included in the 7* Article of the Treaty, and at the same time to protest against the dismantling the Forts, as an act on the Governors own responsibility, and as a violation of the Second Article of the Treaty. As an evidence of my desire to settle the business in the most satisfactory and amicable manner, Cap" Call was instructed to comply with the Governors request for transportation of two Field-pieces from St. Marks and some ordinance Stores. In the same letter I informed the Governor of my intention to move in a few days into the vicinity of Pensacola. I also gave him to understand that the Transports deemed necessary had been provided and might shortly be expected in Pensacola.
On the 16" of June after an unpleasant journey on account of the unusual rains which had prevailed for a considerable time, I arrived
<pb#163 />
at the House of Manuel Gonzales distant fifteen miles from Pensacola, where I intended to await the arrival of the Troops and to remain until I had officially announced to the Governor my entrance into the Floridas for the purpose of receiving possession, as Commissioner on the part of the United States. On the day of my arrival at Manuels I wrote to the Governor * by Col: Gadsden informing him of my arrival at that place, prepared to accomplish the object of my commission. I expressed a wish that a period as early as possible might be concluded on to our mutual convenience when we might meet, exhibit our credentials, officially recognize each other and enter on the duties of our respective Commissions. I stated that Col: Gadsden was authorised by me to take charge of any communications from him and to concert the arrangements connected with the proposition made. On the same evening I received a long letter dated of that day, from the Governor,” in answer to mine, on the subject of the construction of the Treaty, with a few lines on the envelope, informing me, that but for his ill state of health he would have done himself the pleasure of waiting on me in person. My reply dated the 17**
contains a brief refutation of his reasoning, and an expression of my unwilliness to induce him to depart from the positive instructions which he informed me he had received. I concluded by observing that when I should have the pleasure of seeing him personally, I
should hope to make an arrangement agreeably to the instructions given to Cap" Call, and which he had communicated to him, and which will refer the subjects of difference to be adjusted by our respective Governments.
The situation of the Troops now encamped near Manuals was inconvenient on account of the distance from their supplies. There were many reasons strongly requiring that the American Flag should be hoisted in Pensacola without delay; American vessels were arriving and were expected to arrive which had sailed from Ports of the U. States under the faith of the expected surrender, and which would be exposed to the payment of heavy duties through the means of an arbitrary valuation; there had been a great increase of American population and which was augmenting every day, and the state of things incident to a country so nearly on the point of being transferred forever to the dominion of a nother Nation may be readily conceived:
added to all this, the neglect of the police which I was informed existed in Pensacola, and attention to which is so important to a place that must be indebted to this circumstance perhaps more than to any other, for its future growth. Under all these circumstances I authorised Col: Gadsden to make the proposition mentioned in his letter
<pb#164 />
of the 18** in the hope that it might possibly meet the approbation of Governor Callava, but without intending to insist upon it. From the other part of Col: Gadsdens letter it will be seen that it was my wish, a time and place might be designated at which we might meet, recognize each other and enter on the business of our respective Commissions. A misapprehension occured on this subject which was not explained until the close of our correspondence. Not receiving such an invitation as I thought I had a right to expect, and not being visited by the Governor or any of his Officers, I concluded to remain with my family where I was, and as the Governor had officially recognized me as commissioner, I resolved to carry on the preparatory negotiation by means of my Staff.
I received another letter from the Governor on the 19* * together with his letter to Col: Gadsden.” I refer you to my reply of the day following * in which I enter into a full and explicit statement of what I conceived to have been misunderstood. In the course of that communication after enumerating some of the more urgent reasons on my part for obtaining a speedy delivery of West Florida, I requested him to state in how many days after the arrival of the Troops from St.
Marks he would be prepared to evacuate the Floridas. Imentioned the circumstance of one of the Transports the Anna Maria having arrived some time before, the Cora having unfortunately been cast away near the Balize, but that prompt measures had been taken to remedy the misfortune. In the same communication I informed the Governor of the appointment of Major Stanton to discharge the duties attendant on the transportation of the Spanish Troops and to concert the necessary measures for their comfort. In the concluding observations of my letter I regretted the existing difference respecting the construction of any Articles of the Treaty, the stipulations of which we were in part commissioned to execute. I received on the
22nd the Governors letter of that date * together with the one of the
20" " enclosing several propositions relating to preliminary arrangements for the surrender of the Country and the Fortifications of Barrancas. In the letter of the 22" he informed me that Don Alba was merely the bearer of despatches from the Captain General, and clothed with no official character, in relation to the Floridas, and declared himself to be the Commissioner. He waved the exhibition of my commission for the present, but requested an attested copy, which was accordingly sent. In reply to my request of appointing
<pb#165 />
a day after the arrival of the Troops from St. Marks for the delivery of West Florida, he stated that as soon as the Garrison of Appalache should reach Pensacola, and the transports should be ready, he considered four or six days at the utmost as sufficient for the delivery of it, the embarkation of the equipage, Troops and other individuals;
whence he declared that I might now consider the time solicited by me to be fixed. The subject of the Artillery was again touched upon in his letter, when I had flattered myself with a hope that it had been well understood and settled. The Artillery and its appendages he informed me could not be submitted to any kind of compromise, such at least was the meaning given to the Spanish expressions, no puedo yo sugetarlo à ningun clase de compromiso. Not a little surprised at what appeared to me little short of equivocation; on the receipt of it, I experienced no small degree of mortification. I called upon Cap'
Call for his report, whether he had not communicated to Governor Callava, my Instructions given him in relation to this subject, and immediately upon receiving his report, to which I beg leave to refer you,” I addressed Governor Callava my communication of the 23* *
in which I deemed it necessary to recapitulate what I had said on the subject of the construction of the second and Seventh Articles of the Treaty, and in order to prevent any future misunderstanding I reduced the subject to this—two distinct propositions.
1st. That an Inventory of the Cannon, munitions of War &c. &c.
belonging to the Fortifications ceded should be taken and signed by the proper Officers authorised to do so, with a remark that said Cannon, ordinance &c. were claimed by him but left in my possession, subject to any future disposition which might be made of them by our respective Governments.
2nd. That an Inventory of the transportation of families of Officers and Servants, and provisions placed on board of the Transports for the supply of the Troops on their voyage should be made out and certified by you as furnished by me.
I observed that these were the propositions to which I had supposed he had assented, and that they corresponded with the instructions given to Cap" Call. I had now hoped the subject was understood and at rest. In the Governors reply of the 25*" he acknowledges himself to be well acquainted with the tenor of the particulars which it embraces, and particularly with that part which relates to the Artillery, he declares that no mistake could have occurred in the account given by him to the Minister of his Catholick Majesty at Washington, and in the concluding part of his letter he observes that
<pb#166 />
no objection, or remark, offers itself to giving me a certificate setting forth the number of persons transported, and of the provisions supplied them for their voyage.
A Short correspondence to which I refer you, had at the same time taken place respecting the transmission to St. Augustine of the necessary Orders for the delivery of that place. I refer you also to my letter to Col: Forbes" and his reply.” The length to which this communication has already been unavoidably drawn out precludes me from making any remarks at present on this business.
The circumstance however added to the necessity of despatching Col: Gadsden to St. Augustine, and preparatory to this I prepared the letter to Col: Butler,” the Commission to Mr Worthington *
and letter to that Gentleman," with other documents referred to, and of which I gave an account in my letter to you of the 29" of June *
In that letter you will perceive my understanding respecting the provisional arrangement on the subject of the disputed Articles of the Treaty clearly and fully expressed. I refer you to the correspondence between the Governor and myself previous to that date and after the 25* This tedious length of correspondence in settling so many matters of detail, as well as of greater importance, was what I
had not expected, and in the then state of my health, was extremely fatiguing. In my letter of the 26" " I expressed my satisfaction that we had not misunderstood each other on the subject of the Artillery &c. &c. By good fortune, when much at a loss for a mode of conveyance for Col: Gadsden, the extraordinary rains having rendered the passage across the Country almost impracticable, the U. States Schooner Revenge entered this Port and was instantly put in requisition for the service above mentioned. M. Forbes, and Don Alba, or rather the Governor in his behalf solicited a passage, but on being informed that the vessel was extremely small, having, but one birth, which the Commander had given up to Col: Gadsden I could not consent: Col: Forbes however, embarked without my consent, knowledge or approbation.
I refer you to my letters of the 1" of July * for several preliminary arrangements proposed and acceded to respecting the preparation of the Process Verbal, the ceremony to be observed in changing the
<pb#167 />
Flag," and the appointment of Mess" Call Bronaugh and Brackenridge to unite with the like number of persons to be appointed by the Governor to examine and compare the Inventories of Archives, and Public buildings & Property." Major Stanton had been appointed for the same service in relation to the artillery and the taking of the Inventory and receipt for the provisions and transportation of Civil Officers &c. &c.
By letter of the 3" of July "I communicated to the Governor the arrival of Ship “Lucy ann,” chartered in the room of the “Cora.” I
intimated that I hoped no delay would occur on the arrival of the Vessels from St. Marks, or the embarkation of the Spanish Troops &c.
on board the transports then ready and the surrender of the Country, that the vessels were under a heavy demurrage, and that I relied on his pledge that no unnecessary delay would be permitted on the arrival of the Transports. The accident of the loss of the Cora, and the unusual detention of the vessels from St. Marks, by contrary winds, had already given the Governor much longer time than he could possibly have calculated on, when he gave me the pledge already mentioned.
Every day which now passed was so much gained on the other side, and a heavy expence to the United States. Instead of three or four days the usual voyage from St. Marks to this place, the vessels were detained by adverse winds thirteen days, and at length arrived at Pensacola on the morning of the 9" of July. This event I communicated without loss of time to the Governor by my letter of the 9* *
and requested him to appoint a day for the delivery of West Florida with the Fortress of St. Marks according to the agreement previously entered into between us. I had been unremitted in my endeavors, as I think will fully appear by the correspondence, to leave nothing unsettled on the arrival of the vessels from St. Marks so as to permit no possible excuse for delay, as the Hornet had been here a month already owing to the unlooked for loss of the Cora and the extraordinary prevalence of Westerly Winds, which prevented the arrival of the vessels just mentioned. For my correspondence with Major Fanning " I also refer to the accompanying documents. I also send you a copy of the orders issued by me to Col: Brooke "preparatory to the march of the Troops to Galvez Spring. My intention of moving to some convenient spot near Pensacola immediately before taking possession of West Florida had already been intimated to the Governor
<pb#168 />
and assented to. In answer to my request the Governor in his letter of the tenth "informed me that on the day following he would name a day in conformity with his pledge. But on the day following, to my astonishment he informed me by his letter of the 11" " that on Saturday the 14" he would inform me whether the surrender should be made on the Monday or Tuesday following: both of these days beyond the latest period fixed upon for the delivery. I confess I
could not but feel considerable irritation, for it seemed to me that if I
permitted him to disregard his pledge at will in one particular, there was no knowing what was next to follow. I was disappointed in what I had confidently expected, and under these feelings addressed him my letter of the 12* of July.” The Troops had marched the day before to Galvez Spring, and were on that day joined by me at that place. To the Governors letter of the 13" " and my reply of the same date "I must beg leave to refer you. I sincerely regretted the unpleasant feeling occasioned by the circumstance I have detailed, but I acted under a sense of duty and a firm conviction of the necessity of the course pursued. The Governor fixed upon the 17* as the day for the delivery, unequivocally and without reserve, and in my letter of that date I advised you" of my having obtained possession of West Florida.
I had reposed in the utmost confidence after the friendly and satisfactory manner in which the delivery was made on the 17* that the business was finally closed in the way I could have desired. But in this, I regret to say; I have been disappointed. On the day just mentioned, all papers, Inventories &c. were duly prepared for signature on either side, excepting the Inventory & receipt for provisions
&c. not expressly stipulated for under the 7" Article of the Treaty.
On the morning of the 17* Major Stanton informed me that he had been waited on by M. Cruzat the Governors Secretary, who on the part of the Governor, stated, that from ill health, and press of business, he was not able to attend to the Inventory at that time, and requesting that it might be deferred, pledging himself that it should be made out in conformity with the agreement, and satisfactory to me. When this request was reported to me, I confess I was not a little surprised, and in spite of the high opinion which my Officers entertained of Governor Callava, and my own sincere wish to cherish the same opin-
<pb#169 />
ion, the recollection of the conduct we have on so many occasions experienced from Spanish functionaries, and particularly the conduct of Governor Folk" towards Mess" Ellicot” and Hawkins; * rendered it impossible for me entirely to divest my mind of distrust. I had constantly cautioned those under my orders to be on their guard, and on this occasion I observed to M Stanton, who it will be seen by the accompanying documents had been fully instructed on the subject, that if he could place confidence in the promises of the Governor and his Secretary I had no objection to the indulgence. After the Governor was restored to better health and walking about the Town, I urged Major Stanton to obtain the Inventory and receipt, in order that I might close my communication to the Government.
After a delay of some days a receipt was presented to me, which on being translated, I found with indignation, to be a simple acknowledgement that the transportation and provisions had been furnished by the U. States in compliance with the stipulations of the 7" Article of the Treaty. I immediately informed Major Stanton that such a thing could not be received, and ordered him to call on Mr. Cruzat and procure the kind of receipt agreed upon in our correspondence, and which he had pledged himself should be given. After a lapse of ten days, the note to Major Stanton from M'Cruzat was presented to me,” in which I am informed that no other receipt than the one which the Governor choose to offer would be given. I immediately appointed Doctor Bronaugh to wait on Governor Callava in company with Major Stanton and demand a receipt in strict & literal conformity with my letter of the 23" of June * and assented to in his letter of the 25** I refer you to the report of those Gentlemen, by which it will be seen that he utterly refused. I then addressed him my letter of the 3" of August * declaring in the most explicit manner that in consequence of his faithless conduct the receipt given by me for the Artillery is null and void, and that I should so report it to my Government, the execution of the one, being the consideration of the other.
The conduct of Governor Callava has mortified me exceedingly, especially as I had wished to think well of him, and as he had been uniformly represented to me as a frank, honorable soldier; I cannot
<pb#170 />
but view his refusal under the circumstances detailed as a most base and flagrant breach of faith. To prove that there could have been no misunderstanding on the score of translations I beg leave to refer you to the Certificate of Mess Brackenridge and Rutledge.”
I now proceed to lay before you the measures adopted by me for the Government of East and West Florida in the best manner possible for the present. In this Province the Government like every thing else was in a state of dismemberment and neglect. The circumstance of being on the eve of a transfer to the United States occasioned a total indifference and carelessness in the administration of all its branches.
For a more minute account I refer you to the report of Judge Brackenridge * and to the ordinances herewith sent." According to the Spanish scheme of municipal administration, there ought to have been an Alcade, a Judge de Partido, a Fiscal, a Cabildo or Corporation, and Alguazils or Sheriff and Constables. At Pensacola none of these Offices were filled except that of the Alcade, who was the only Civil Provincial Officer, properly speaking in West Florida. To limp along with this maimed and imperfect state, seemed to me intolerable.
On consultation with an eminent Lawyer from New Orleans, who was present at the change of Government there, and also with Judge Brackenridge a Gentleman of high legal acquirements, who was in Louisiana sometime after, I resolved, without going as far as I understood the Governor of that Province had gone, to fill up those Offices which I found vacant, and to make such alterations as seemed to me absolutely called for by the mere circumstance of the cessation of the Government of Spain, and the extension of that of the United States over the Country. The first Ordinance "establishes the Corporation, to which this place under the Spanish Constitution is entitled. The great accession of population, and the neglect of the police for the last two years, called for a body exclusively entrusted with its superintendance. Their powers conform to those which they would have possessed under the Spanish Government. The Taxes which they are authorised to lay, are such as have been usually paid. The Board of Health was peculiarly necessary from the vital importance to this place, to preserve its character for salubrity. The Ordinance relating to the registering the names of those who may be desirous of claiming the benefit of the sixth article of the Treaty, was dictated, first by the necessity of affording some evidence which could be used by those who were at once disposed to make their election and become Citizens of the United States, and without which they would still be regarded as foreigners, and secondly by the impropriety, of which, I had no
<pb#171 />
little experience in Louisiana, of persons claiming exemption as foreigners, and the privileges of Citizens as it suited their convenience.
The establishment of a County Court, by adding four Justices of the Peace to the Presiding Judge was with a view to the police of the County, as that of the City was entrusted to the Corporation, and also for the trial of offences against the public peace and happiness.
The Presentments, and trial by Jury are both in the contemplation of the Spanish Constitution, as well as that of the U. States. The Ordinance regulating the proceedings in the Court in civil cases, rather makes known, the Spanish proceedure than establishes any thing new to the Spanish law, excepting the pronouncing final judgment in public on set days, and requiring the witnesses to give evidence viva voce when their attendance can be procured. The appointment of Justices of the Peace was so necessary a measure, particularly in the remote settlements, which are rapidly increasing, that it seems scarcely necessary to say any thing on the subject—It must be recollected that much the greater part of the population of this country is American, that the action commenced is carried on by Americans, and hence the necessity of assimilating the present institution to something which they can understand, and of administering the laws by means of tribunals not altogether foreign to their habits and feelings. The distance from the seat of Government is a great inconvenience, as months must elapse before any suggested alterations can be approved and put in operation. I believe the alterations which I
have made, unimportant as they are, strictly conform to my instructions, and are certainly indispensable, unless all civil Government should be suspended for the present. Col: Butler informs me that the municipal organization was more complete at St. Augustine; that beside the Alcade, there was a Judge, and a Cabildo or Corporation, but little change will therefore be necessary in that quarter. The Commission under which I act does not define my powers, and I
assure you I am not a little at a loss when left to collect them from the nature of the office. Judging from the practice in Spanish Colonies, the Viceroy or Captain General, possesses legislative, as well as the executive powers over the Provinces placed under his Government: Oreilly in Louisiana of his own authority, introduced the Spanish law, and established tribunals exactly modeled after those of Spain.
But according to the decrees passed under the constitution, those Officers are strictly confined to the exercise of military and executive, or political power; and the Intendants are exclusively intrusted with the superintendance of the Revenue and public property; the former is excepted by the act of Congress. In this uncertainty I have contented myself with merely organizing a Government from the materials at hand, with as little change as possible, promulgating the same, by way of Ordinance in order that the people may have some
<pb#172 />
knowledge of the system to to which they must conform.” These Ordinances I now transmit for the approval of the President.
From the report of Judge Brackenridge it will be seen, that the only public documents or Archives delivered over, are those which in the first place belong to the Notarial Office, consisting of transfers of land from individuals, powers of attorney, protests, wills, and other acts, which in Spanish Countries appertain to the duties of Notary.
An Inventory of the unbound Books containing these acts, is transmitted, giving the year and number of pages of each book. In pursuance of my directions, they were marked by Mess" Call, Bronaugh and Brackenridge (who were appointed to compare them with the Inventory) with a letter of the Alphabet, and signed, in order that they may be identified. In the second place, the archives of the Alcades office, and which consist of the papers in suits, from the year
1781. down to the present time, and are very voluminous, but many of them, it is supposed, have been withdrawn, or sent to Havanna, and as there is no Docket, or book containing a record of those papers, being considered themselves as the records, it is extremely difficult to detect any fraud with respect to them. There are no original grants, Surveys, Maps, or even a plat of the City. It is well known that all these papers are at Havanna in the possession of the late Surveyor General Pintado, in whose transcripts of title papers, I do not think any reliance ought to be placed. Having the Archives in his possession, he gives authenticated Copies, and states himself in the Certificates, to be duly authorised to do so. From this Shop it is probable that a number of such titles were transmitted to this Country, by the Hornet. I am confident that very extensive frauds have been attempted, this opinion is dayly strengthened by observation, and I think it highly important that persons of integrity and intelligence should be appointed to sift them. The failure to obtain the archives at Havanna, will be seriously felt by the honest inhabitants of the Country, and will call for more than usual vigilance and attention on the part of the Government to prevent frauds in antidated titles. The conduct of the Captain General in relation to the Archives, but too well confirms the opinion which I entertained of Spanish functionaries, at least so far as we have had any thing to do with them.
The report of Major Stanton,” and the Inventory of Artillery &c.
receipted for, will shew the value of those articles. Every thing however worthless has been brought forward in order to swell that Inventory to an imposing magnitude. I am well satisfied that with the
<pb#173 />
exception of two Brass pieces at the Barrancas, and two Mortars and three Howitzers, the Cannon left with us, is scarcely worth possessing.
The Artillery at St. Marks is literally worthless, and I am of opinion that the value of the whole does not much exceed the extra transportation and the provisions which have been furnished, and not expressly stipulated for by the Treaty. Major Stantons report" will also shew the condition of the public buildings. The Government House is in a ruinous state; I intended at first to occupy it myself, but on examination it was considered unsafe. It is a frame building, no way remarkable for its structure, and at present entirely out of repair and in some parts rudely propped with unhewn timber. It has been taken by the Officers for Quarters, by which there has been a considerable saving to the Government. The Block-Houses were the most filthy and disgusting places imaginable, but with some pains they have been fitted up in such a manner as to afford quarters for the Troops.
The Hospital, which is but a very ordinary building, was in a condition equally disgusting, but has been rendered fit for use by the exertions of the Officers. The prison is in a tolerable state of repair, but is a very poor building; all the rest are uninhabitable. The Barracks are said to have cost the British Government a large sum of money. The frame is still sound, the basement story is of brick; but the doors and windows have been torn off, the roof is decayed and in part fallen in. Unless something be done in the course of a few months, it will be necessary to pull it down, as it will become a dangerous nuisance. The expence of repairing it will not be less than from twelve to fifteen thousand Dollars. Proposals have been made to me by a Major Edwards, to repair it, at his own expence, on condition that he shall have the use of it for six years. The offer appears to me a very advantageous one to the U. States. But possessing no power to enter into it, I could do nothing more than to forward his proposals for the consideration of the President, with a request that an answer may be given as speedily as possible.
In my appointments to Office I was desirous of giving the preference where I could, to the old inhabitants of the Country: I found that but few were willing to accept any situation, from unwillingness to lose their rights as Spanish subjects, the greater part having been in some way or other connected with the Government, or having private claims which might be prejudiced by doing any act evincing their intention to become American Citizens. Besides, it is said, that strong inducements are held out by the Spanish Government to those who remove. The former Alcade was a half pay Officer and of course could not be continued. The inhabitants in general, I
have found a sober, orderly, peaceable and well meaning people.
<pb#174 />
I entertain a very favorable opinion of all the Spanish population, excepting of such as have been employed by the Government which seems to have had every where the same corrupting influence over the minds and morals of those engaged in its administration.
I have confined myself in this communication to the subject of my Commission for receiving the Floridas,” and to the mere organization of the Government, reserving for a future & final communication the information which I may possess in relation to the Country in general.
The arrival of Col: Butler from St. Augustine, and whose report is transmitted in another communication,” has happily enabled me to close the business of my Commission; this I hope, has been done in such a manner as to meet the approbation of my Government.
I have the honor to be, Sir, with g’ consideration & respect Y M*

<docbody>SIR, In obedience to your Excellency's order of the 28 instant,"
directing me to make a report in writing to your Excellency of all the public buildings turned over by Don José Callava and the State of repair which they are in”.—I have, as far as practicable, examined those situated in Pensacola; and have now the honor of communicating to your Excellency their number and condition; taken in the order in which they are entered in the Inventory furnished by the late Spanish Authorities .
Barracks: A building situated to the east of the Government House; and a short distance from the same: One hundred fifty six and a half feet long, by forty six and a half feet wide—three stories in highth—the basement story of Brick with floors of the same—the others of wood—the whole much dilapidated. The doors and windows have been destroyed. The Galleries which formerly surrounded the edifice have entirely disappeared. The roofs in several places is decayed and fallen in—The projection of the roof deprived of the support of the timbers of the galleries is on one side hanging in broken fragments. The roof and floor timbers much decayed. The weather boards in some places together with the plastering of the interior have been torn off; and the whole of the appartments exposed to the injuries of the weather; and in a most filthy condition-
It is extremely difficult, if not impossible to ascertain the sum that would be required to put this building in a state of complete repair;
but from what I can learn of the price of materials and labour, it cannot be done; in my opinion for less than eight thousand dollars, unless the public Artificers and labourers from the troops were employed in procuring the necessary materials; and in effecting the work: In which case the expense would be comparitively small—
The Government House. Twenty nine feet by eighteen of three stories. The Basement story of brick, the others of wood slightly built (surrounded by broad Piazzas) but in decent repair; and affords convenient quarters for most of the officers of the Garrison. The Mess House and Kitchen situated near the Government House, is also in decent repair The Stables out of repair The buildings which constitute the Hospital are four in number, situated on the corner of [blank] Street adjoining the lot occupied by José Rock—one forty eight feet by thirty six, another forty feet by twenty two, both of wood, indifferently constructed—Two small buildings used as Kitchens also of wood. The labour of a few Artificers
<pb#176 />
for a short time, will be able to effect the necessary repairs on those Buildings Four Block Houses situated on the public place, Thirty feet and a half square, constructed of logs, on brick foundations are, with the exception of one situated near the church, much decayed. Artificers are now employed in effecting such repairs as will render them convenient quarters for the four companies of Infantry composing the Garrison of Pensacola. The expense of doing which, will not be very considerable. The four buildings denominated in the Inventory.
Guard Houses contiguous to the Block Houses require considerable repairs. They are to be occupied as Kitchens and company storehouses— *
A wooden Building situated on the Bay, and to the east of Tivoli seventy four feet by twenty seven, formerly used as Dragoons quarters, in a decayed state; and not worth repairing.
Three Block Houses situated without the town, Built of Logs each twenty three feet square. They require no repairs.

<docbody>Dr SIR, Having advised you through the Secretary of State that I

usage and custom of Spain, a just regard to the real condition of this country, and a strict conformity to your instructions, would authorise, and which the peace, happiness and security of this newly acquired Territory required; I have at length the pleasure to advise you, that this laborious duty was closed on the 27" ultimo,” and that on the day following by a despatch-express over land te-St-Augustine; the copies of all proper ordinances with the commissions necessary to their execution, were sent to St Augustine to W" G. Worthington, to whom by Co Gadsden on the first instant, I had transmitted a commission clothing him with all the powers heretofore exercised by the Spanish Governor, and fearful that M Worthington might not have arrived, I also sent a blank commission provisionally to be filled in the absence of M' W, in the name of the commanding officer of St Augustine." I
find that this was a wise precaution, as from a letter received from Mr Worthington on yesterday the 26" July, dated Baltimore 30" of June," it appears that he thinks there cannot be any urgent necessity for his presence in a short time. If there exists not a necessity for the

Manuscript copies of 1 to 5, transmitted by Jackson to the Sec. of State, July

7, transmittal letter not determined, is ibid. Broadside printed copies of 1 to 4
(in English and Spanish), were transmitted by Worthington to the Sec. of State on Aug. 28 (post, p. 192). Copies of 1 to 5 are in LC (Jackson Papers, Lets. and Orders, Bk. M). In the Pensacola Floridian, Aug. 18, 1821, are printed 1, 2, and
4 in English, and 7 appears in the issue of Sept. 8. A receipt of Oct. 8, 1821, signed by Cary Nicholas and George Tunstall, the publishers of the Floridian, lists the Aug. 25 issue of that newspaper as having contained printings of the ordinances in addition to the above (LC, Jackson Papers, Mil. Papers, XIII, 14).
That particular issue is no longer extant. Nos. 1 to 5 of the ordinances were printed in Annals of Congress, 17 Cong., 1 sess., cols. 2547—2555, and subsequently reprinted in A. S. P., Misc., II, 904–908.
The copies transmitted to the House by the Dept. of State are in NA (HF, Orig. Repts., SD and PO, 17 Cong., 1 and 2 sess.). A facsimile reproduction of the broadsides in NA (SD, Fla. Terr.

presence of the Secretaries of the Floridas at this time, when the Government is first in organization, when all commissions are to be made out and attested, surely their services afterwards can be dispensed with—Let me assure you that the absence of the officers appointed,” has given rise to great labour to me, and considerable expense to the Government, for clerks have been employed to do that which should have been done by the Officers duly appointed by you.
The information of M Worthington's being in Baltimore, and my uncertainty as to the safe arrival of Co Gadsden at St Augustine, made it therefore necessary to communicate with St Augustine over land, as in the absence of the one (M' W) and should any absenee accident have detained the Co', there is no person there to administer the Government, until the arrival of my express.
I this day enclose to M' Adams, Secretary of State, a full report of all my proceedings in taking possession of the Floridas," and also as Governor of the same after possession was had, with copies of the ordinances established by me for the Government of the same, which are forwarded for your approval and further instructions. You will find from the report of Judge Brackenridge," exercising the office of Alcalde for the city of Pensacola, that I have in the organization kept as close to the letter of my instructions as the situation of the country would permit. The taxes to be laid on tavern licenses, Billiard tables, Retailers of spirits &" &", by the city corporation and county Courts, are such as have been laid under the Spanish Government, they being the only source through which the necessary funds can be obtained, to keep the springs, streets and canals of the Town in good repair, by which the health of the city can be preserved. I have endeavoured in my letter to the Secretary of State to explain through him to you, the reasons for introducing every ordinance for the Government of the Floridas, to which I beg leave te refer to you.
I should have closed these arduous duties fifteen days since, had it not been for the treacherous and dishonorable conduct of Governor Callava, in whom some of myofficers had incautiously trusted and viewing him as a high minded-military man, in whose pledge of honor they could place implicit reliance, did not for a moment suspect the deception and baseness which they have since experienced. I had entrusted to Major Staunton, Quarter Master, the procurement of the trans-
<pb#179 />
portation and provisions; and of course when Governor Callava claimed the right of taking from the fortifications their means of defence, I
claimed an exemption from the cost of provisions & transportation, of civil officers, including the families and servants of both the civil and military officers. The Governor proposed that the Ordnances &"
&"—should be inventoried and receipted for, to which I assented, having the Provisions, transportation &" &" &" inventoried and receipted for in the same manner, which was, and well understood, to be agreed to and to be referred to our Governments, as you will see by referring to our correspondence duly reported to M' Adams and to which I refer you. The duty of taking the Inventory and receipt, was enjoined upon Major Staunton, as you will see by my letter of instructions of the 6* July," and he had been verbally instructed and urged by me to be particular on this subject, for although my officers had great confidence in Governor Callava, I was too well acquainted with the Spanish character and with the intrigue and duplicity exercised by Govt Foulk with Ellicott and Co Hawkins, to have any: I therefore was particular in urging all concerned to beware, and do their duty carefully. At length the 17" was fixed upon for delivery of the country, and, as I supposed, all inventories and receipts ready for execution on the morning of that day. Whilst on my march to Pensacola, Maj. Staunton reported to me” that M. Crusat "secretary of Gov” Callava, had reported to him, that the ill health of the Governor, and great press of business had prevented him from having the inventory of the provisions, transportation for civil officers, their families and servants &" &", ready; but hoped that it would make no difference, as the Gov' was to remain, and as soon as his health would permit, the inventory and receipt should be made in comformity to the agreement contained in our correspondence, and satisfactory to me. I replied to the Major," that he was responsible for this Inventory and receipt—
if he had full confidence that the pledge would be complied with, I had no objection to this indulgence, as the Governor was ill—the Major replying" that he had full confidence, the indulgence was granted.
A few days after, wishing to close my communications—the Governor being apparently well and walking the Town—I directed Maj. Staunton to call upon him for a fulfilment of his engagement, and to my surprise after ten days he refused, I could not believe it possible, I ordered Doctor Bronough and Maj. Staunton to wait upon him with an Inven-
<pb#180 />
tory" precisely in the words of my letter of the 23" of June 17 to which he had assented—He has refused however after this previous obligation, as stated in the report of Bronough and Staunton, to which I refer you." I then wrote him my letter of the 3”,” and have left him to the reflections of his own conscience, and have a hope that my Government will stamp his perfidy with such marks of displeasure as will convince Spanish Officers hereafter to comply with their engagements of honor.
Having finished the arduous and unpleasant duty of establishing and putting in motion the Government in the Floridas I have a moment to spare to reply to your letter of the 23" of May last.”
I have to remark that the Judicial districts established by you in the Floridas are well arranged, and I have adopted them nearly in the division of the two counties I have established for Judicial purposes.
As to the Gentlemen you have selected to fill the appointments in the Floridas, not knowing any of them but Judge Duval and Frommentin and those very slightly, I have no remark to make, believing that you would appoint none to office, that you did not believe competent and of good character. It is unfortunate that sometimes you may be, as we all are, imposed upon-As to myself I
have only to say that I had a right to expect from the manner and inducements under which I agreed to accept the office, that at least the Secretary of West Florida would have been a man of my personal acquaintance, and in whom I had confidence—had I not confidently expected this, I should never have accepted the office; I feel however happy that the objects which induced my acceptance are nearly completed; the country has been received, the Government is organized and when in complete operation I shall eagerly embrace the condition which qualified my acceptance, which was, the liberty of retiring to private life, and it may be, that in the selection of your officers you had stieh an eye to this contingency.
There are none of the officers appointed, yet arrived; except Judge Frommentin, who reached me on the 27" ult°, but not having his commission cannot enter upon the duties of his office. I would not be acting towards you with the faithfulness and candor of a friend, did I not bring to your view the opinions expressed here of the characters you have appointed as Judges—It is understood here that M” Duval is a good private character, but of very moderate capacity as a Lawyer—as to M* Frommentin, his character is spoken of with great freedom; it is said and that too by men of high standing here, and

those who have been here from New Orleans, that all are astonished at his being appointed as a Judge, and it is publickly stated, that he was brought up a Priest in France, at the downfall of the Bourbons he fled from the republican reign—came to America—settled in Maryland and married into a respectable family—removed to Orleans and was there appointed a senator in Congress, and whilst in that capacity on the restoration of the Bourbons, left his wife, took up with a base woman, travelled publickly with her to Orleans, and took her with him to Orleans France where he repaired, as is alledged and believed, to regain his Priesthood, disannul his marriage and continue his intercourse secret with this base woman: But disappointed in obtaining his Priesthood, he returned to America, conceded to his wife, and returned again to Orleans with his—wife her, where he resided until clothed with an agency under our Government appertaining to the treaty with Spain, he came here, borrowed money, which he failed duly to pay before he left here, for which suit was brought against him, and in the Spanish form proceedings of a kind of Outlawry were entered against him, all of which appear on record and were posted on the corners of the houses when I arrived.
First impressions are always the most lasting, and it was of vital importance to the future welfare and greatness of this country, that in the first instance the Judiciary should have been filled, not only by men of unspotted and unimpeached moral character, but men of first standing in point of Legal Knowledge, securing them universal confidence both in their talents and integrity, and freedom from the suspicion of Bribery ahd or the capability of corruption—But what confidence can these people have in a Judiciary, protecting their moral and civil rights, in which the only Judge who presides, in his private walks respects neither? I must confess since I have heard this story (and it is freely spoken of and said to be publickly known)
I should not like to continue in the administration of the Government with such an associate.
The first duty of all Executives to the countries over which they preside, is to give to the people competent and fit persons to execute the laws provided for the security of their lives, their liberties, their reputations and their property; And I can assure you this confidence does not exist either in the Spanish or American population here, in the case of Judge Frommentin. Knowing this, I have viewed it as my duty to you—as a friend to make it known, with the assurance that I have no unfriendly feeling towards Mr Frommentin. He is a polite, Gentlemanly man, but from the character given of him both here and in Orleans, both as to his capacity as a Judge and his moral character, I cannot confide in him—As to the rest of the Gentlemen I have a good report; my only regret is, that they were not here to aid me in the labours of organizing the Government. However, with
301867-56-12
<pb#182 />
the aid of my old and faithful companions Doctor Bronough Cap'
Call, with the assistance of Judge Brackenridge, whom I have found intelligent and very useful from his general acquaintance with the law, the Spanish language, usage and customs; I trust you will find the Government organised with the sole view to the protection of the citizen in all his rights secured under the Treaty and the constitution of the United States—
You will find from the report of the Quartermaster, Maj. Staunton,”
accompanying the report to the Secretary of State. that the public buildings are in such a state of dilapidation, that it will not be in my power to accommodate M. Smith.” and others as you have requested.
The Government House is the only one except the Block Houses and the Hospital, that is inhabitable, and the Government House was so unsafe that I gave it to the Quarter Master for as the Quarters of the Officers, and accepted in lieu thereof, the upper story of a House for my self, family and suit, by which there is a saving to the Government of upwards of one hundred dollars per month. The fine building called the barracks is in a state of ruin; a proposition has been made by a M. Edwards to repair it, for a lease of six years; the proposition I think a beneficial one and ought to be acceded to on the part of the Government; but having no power to accept it on the part of the Government, his proposition and my letter to him, have been referred to the Secretary of State,” to which I beg leave to draw your attention and request your early reply—It will take from twelve to fifteen thousand dollars to make the repairs offered to be made by M"
Edwards, and if not made by some one in four months, it will be in such a state of ruin as will compel the corporation to pull it down, to preserve the lives of the citizens, who are in constant danger when passing under it.
I should here close this letter; but that justice to the military character, which I hold dear, requires that I should brifly notice the recommendation redueing the Army accompanying the Register reducing the Army and recently made public. It is with extreme
<pb#183 />
regret, that I have met the initiation produced by this unmilitary recommendation made by the board of Gen' Officers and promulgated to the world, where six meritorious officers are to be removed from place to place, reduced from grade to grade, and one driven out of office, to give one favorite officer an election of offices; however meritorious that officer might be, his merits cannot be superior to some of those six officers whose military feelings have been excoriated by this unusual, unmilitary procedure which has not its equal in military Annals. Gen' Atkinson is a favorite of mine, but still general justice is due to all, and we have no record of that superior display of Gen.' Atkinson's military prowess, of battles won, and countries saved, to justify such an election of offices, at the expense of others who were distinguished in the late war, and who had the honor in their country's cause to be engaged in more conflicts with the enemy, than any of those who composed the Board of Gen.'
Officers—I admit that it was due to Gen' Atkinson, that he should be provided for; but just in the way that other meritorious officers were; that one office should have been selected by the Board for him, which he might have accepted or not, at his pleasure. Can it have been supposed by this Board of high minded-military men, that those six officers of equal high minds and military merit, could ever brook the insult, and condescend to be drove from place to place, from grade to grade and some out of office, to make way for one individual not more meritorious than themselves? This could not have been thought by those who formed the Board, and why this recommendation has been published with the register, all military men are at a loss to discover, unless it was still more to excoriate the feelings of those six officers by holding forth Gen' Atkinson, their superior, and that those ef six were retained out of mere special favour, and placed at the disposal of the General. These military men must either be devoid of military feeling themselves, or calculate badly on the feelings of others. Can they expect others of equal military merit to succumb to things, that they themselves as military men would spurn? And let me ask, what will be the sensations of the Public, when it is understood that this election of offices has been given to one who has never fought one battle for his country, at the expense of others who have fought many, and always obtained the approbation of those who commanded them? To Gen' Gaines the officers of this Division looked for protection, and how he will be able to explain this, to the satisfaction of those Gentlemen, I cannot say—Co" Taylor if I judge of him rightly, will resign and in short none of those who were thus placed in the Register, can consistently remain in the service; As for my own part before I would be thus degraded I would grub for a subsistence. I can assure you it has produced a general feeling of disapprobation, which I sensibly feel, 
<pb#184 />
knowing the personal merits of several of those Gentlemen who deserved to be better treated by their country in a more delicate manner to say the least of it, for Gen' Atkinson could have been amply provided for without placing this unmilitary thing upon the register, or making any officers subordinate to his will and or election.
I have thought it my duty thus far to remark, that you might consider the subject and extend justice to those men whose feelings are much wounded by this unexampled procedure, and such as never should have taken place without my public protest had I been one of the Board.
Altho I have retired from the command of those brave and meritorious officers to the Prowess of many of whom I have borne testimony in the hour of battle and of danger, I still feel for them.
With a tender of M" Jackson's and my best wishes for M" Munroe and your amiable family, and with my great regard for your individual happiness, I remain Sir with great respect. Y' Mo Obt Servant.

SIR, Your letter of the 17" ultimo has been received.”
The measures you have taken for the repairs of the Fort and public buildings at S" Augustine are approved; but as the funds of the Q" M* Dep" are low, you will execute them with as little expense as possible.
The excursion of M*Intosh and his party into the country of the Seminole Indians, was entirely unknown to this Department. I
presume it was intended merely for the purpose of plundering; but I
hope, that, if they should repeat their visit, the measures you propose to take will put a stop to their proceedings.
The French gentleman to whom you refer, I think it probable is M". Penieres, who was recommended to this Department as a gentleman eminent for his various acquirements, who, being forced from
<pb#185 />
France for political reasons, had selected this country for his residence, and who, in order to become intimately acquainted with the Indian Character, had resided several years among the Indians in the Arkansas Territory, and upon whom the President thought proper to confer the appointment of Sub-agent for Indian affairs in Florida:
Under the authority of which appointment, I presume he is now acting, conformably to the instructions which he has received from this Department, and will therefore be respected accordingly. Gen.'
Jackson was duly informed of his appointment, and authorized to give him such further instructions as he might think necessary.
You will assure the Indians that may visit S*Augustine, that the views of the Government towards them are perfectly friendly, and that so long as they conduct themselves peaceably, they will be protected.
I have the honor &c. &c.

<docbody>Copy of a letter to W* G D Worthington or Cap" John R Bell, exercising the powers of the Governor of East Florida, dated PENSA-
COLA August 9" 1821
SIR, On the 28" ult” I dispatched as express,” Cap" Hanham, to you with sundry ordinances that I found it necessary to adopt for the better organisation of the Government of the Floridas. The ordinances are only a declaration of what the Spanish law really is," and
<pb#188 />
what its operations under the Cortez would have been—the constitution of Spain providing for the trial by Jury in criminal cases, altho’
never extended to the Colonies, because the Treaty ceding the Floridas was concluded before the constitution was adopted and carried into execution in Spain.
When I took possession here, I found nothing but an Alcalde, which was filled by a Spanish Military Officer, who could not therefore hold it under our Government. I appointed an Alcalde, Judge Brakenridge, in whose custody all archives received were placed—finding that a Cabildo had once existed here, I ordained the reestablishmant of it, in that of a Mayor and Alderman of the city, adding a Board of Health to it, and there being no Judge, I created a County Court, with the powers that this Court would have held under the Constitution of Spain and that of the United States.”
Col Butler reached me upon the 8* instant and reports, that he found at St Augustine an Alcalde, a Cabildo and a Judge, all in operation. This will afford you great relief in carrying into effect the Ordinances sent you by Cap" Hanham. In every instance where the incumbents in office will take the necessary oaths of Office and are in your opinion of good moral character and fit for the office, you will continue them. I have found but few of the Spanish inhabitants here that would accept of Offices under our Government, not having determined of themselves whether they would become citizens of the U States, and believing that taking an oath of office would be considered their election to become citizens, have in most cases refused.
It is necessary on the change of the Governments, that all officers who are to execute it under the U States, should take the necessary oaths of Office, and where this is refused, you will fill the vacancies thus occasioned by new appointments, even where the old incumbents will remain, and especially in the latter case, for as Spanish Officers they cannot execute the Government under the U. States *
This will be handed you by M. Bird, who has the appointment by the President of the U. States as Attorney for East Florida."
I am Sir with great Respect, Yr Mo Obt Servant.

<docbody>SIR I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of a translation made gratis by a gentleman of this City of an Invoice of all the Fortresses and publick Edifices known as belonging to the Government,” which was del,d to the American Commissioner Col" Butler and which has been receipted for by the Post Quarter Master Lieutenant Washburn, and I suppose reported by him to the Quarter Master General; It is a document of but little use to us, as all the
<pb#190 />
plans to which it refers were taken off by Col" Butler under a promise that copies of them should be made and forwarded to us, We are endeavouring to hold possession of the publick property, and to do so requires a vigilant eye, for the disposition of the Citizens, and mistaken ideas of Civil Officers keep us constantly on the alert—
Mr Rodman the Collector arrived here on the 11* inst. and was
[MS. torn] impression that he was to occupy the dwelling adjoining the Custom-house (formerly occupied by the Treasurer under the Spanish Government) which I am occupying at present as it is the only building which is in a fit state for Officers Quarters, and I intend to hold possession of it for that purpose until order,d otherwise from Washington—The Officers and men will have to be remov,d from the Fort, the rooms there are without Fire-places and so damp that the men are beginning to be attack,d with rheumatism, at any rate I
do not know any civil Officer entitled to Quarters from the Government, if they are they must produce an order from Gov" for them; and as the property is reported to the Quarter Master General I shall hold it subject to his instructions or your order I also enclose a copy of a translation by the same Gentleman of the Artilery, Arms, Amunicion, and War-like Stores " rec,d by the Post Quarter Master from the Spanish Government agreeably to an arrangement made by the Spanish & American Commissioners My opinion is that no part of the articles enumerated in the account are servicable—The powder is only fit for firing Signal Guns—The post at Matanzas will be dismantled as soon as we can obtain a boat to bring off the ordnance-
I take the liberty to enclose for your informa [MS. torn] of a letter from Mr Dexter * and Talks held with the Seminole Indians *—If something is not soon done to satisfy in some measure the apprehensions of those Indians, and to prevent the incursions of ill disposed whites and indian bands into their country we may expect difficulty with them—At this time almost any reasonable arrangement could be made on the part of the Government, but if delay,d wars of extirmination will take place, and their country cannot during the time be travers,d by the Whites—some Gentlemen were turned back by them and arrived in town yesterday.—

<docbody>ANDREW JACKSON Esquire. Governor of the Floridas SIR I have had the honour of receiving your Letters of the 16.”
17" & 18 Ult.* with their enclosures. They were immediately transmitted to the President who is at the Shannondale Springs.
As it will doubtless be one of the earliest objects of attention to Congress at their ensuing Session to prepare a more permanent system of Government for the Territories of Florida, I would solicit communications from you as early and as ample as you can make them, of information which may serve to enlighten the enquiries upon which it may be expected that this Legislation will be founded.
A reference to the Laws of Congress, which were from time to time enacted for the Government of the Louisiana Territories, may serve to point out some of the particulars upon which information will be most desirable—In this view the following acts are presented to your attention-
1. An Act erecting Louisiana into two Territories, and providing for the temporary Government thereof. 26 March 1804 Laws U. S.
Vol. 3. p. 603 *
2. An Act further providing for the Government of the Territory of Orleans (P. 648) 2 Mar. 1805"
3. An Act further providing for the Government of the District of Louisiana (p.658) 3 Mar. 1805"
4. An Act for ascertaining and adjusting the titles & claims to Land within the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana
(page 652) 2 Mar. 1805 *
5. An Act extending the powers of the Surveyor General to the Territory of Louisiana and for other purposes. (Vol. 4. p. 6)
28 Feby 1806.6%
6. An Act supplementary to an Act, entitled an act for ascertaining and adjusting the titles and claims to land within the Territory of Orleans, and the District of Louisiana. (p. 50) 21 April 1806."
<pb#193 />
7. An Act respecting claims to land in the Territories of Orleans and Louisiana (p. 111.) 3 Mar. 1807 *
8. An Act providing for the final adjustment of Claims to Land, and for the sale of the public Lands in the Territories of Orleans and Louisiana (Vol. 4. p. 322) 15 Feby 1811.”
9. An Act to enable the people of the Territory of Orleans to form a Constitution and State Government, and for the admission of such State into the Union, on an equal footing with the original States and for other purposes. (p.328) 20 Feby 1811."
10. An Act providing for the final adjustment of Claims to Lands and for the Sale of the public Lands, in the Territories of Orleans and Louisiana, and to repeal the act passed for the same purpose and approved. Feby. 16. 1811, p. 356. 3 March 1811.”
11. An Act for ascertaining the titles and claims to Lands in that part of Louisiana which lies east of the River Mississippi and Island of New Orleans. 25 April 1812 *
There may be some others, but my reference to these is merely to suggest the nature of part of the information which it is probable may be desired by Congress in relation to the Floridas, and which it hoped your position will enable you to furnish."

<place-time>PENSACOLA Aug. 20" 1821</place-time>
<docbody>THE HON” J. Q. ADAMS Secretary of State SIR. The time which was to intervene betwixt the moment when I
received your letter of the 27" June last " & the moment when I was informed my answer should be deposited in the post office, was so short that I could not then touch upon the topic which is to be the subject of my present communication.
When I first was informed of my appointment as Judge of the United States for West Florida &c. I understood it to be an appointment to the office of territorial judge with the additional jurisdiction vested in the judges of such territories where no district court of the
<pb#194 />
United States has been established by the act entitled An act to extend jurisdiction in certain cases to the territorial courts passed march 3"
1805.72
Upon receiving my commission & your letter of the 27"june last I
was rather confirmed in that opinion by the concluding paragraph in your letter in the following words:
“and towards the organisation of the temporary government under his (Gen. Jackson's) direction, it may be important that the judiciary department should be put into operation immediately. I may be mistaken; but it seems to me that if the court to which I am appointed is to be confined, as Gen. Jackson contends, to the revenue laws of the United States, and to the act respecting people of color, it could hardly be denominated the judiciary department with reference to the organisation of the temporary government under the direction of Gen.
Jackson.
However I deemed it my duty to communicate my commission &
your letter to Gen. Jackson, who communicated to me in return such parts of his several commissions as he conceives admit of a construction entirely at variance with that which I put upon both my commission & your letter. It was then already too late for me to urge any objections, the territorial court consisting of five judges created by Gen.
Jackson the presiding judge of which by the by is not of age according to the Spanish law which he administers, being only twenty two years, & the law requiring for that office that he should be at least twenty five years, having been already in session one week before my commission reached me.
I told the General that I would write to you on the subject. He told me that he either had written to you already, or would write to you likewise.” In the meantime things must of course go on as I found them established on my arrival here, until I learn from you the precise intentions of the President respecting the extent of the powers vested in me. This representation, I beg you to believe, is not prompted on my part by the remotest desire of assuming a jurisdiction not intended to be given, but by a solemn obligation which I deem to be imposed upon me, to inform you of the difficulties in which I am placed, and to desire you to transmit to me as early as possible the necessary information.
I have heard nothing of or from the marshal or any deputy appointed or to be appointed by him Since the date of my last. I feel very uneasy on the subject, as the public service must necessarily suffer from the absence of that indispensible officer, there being no authority here by which the deficiency may be supplied.
722 STAT. 338–339.
<pb#195 />
The 27" section of the act of september 24" 1789 * prescribes the amount & the mode of the Security to be given by the marshal & his deputies; & the form of the oath to be taken by them. And unless Judge Duval should now be in S*Augustine to have those necessary forms complied with, I know not when I am to expect here a deputy marshal duly qualified. I say a deputy, because I understand that the marshal himself contemplates making S*Augustine the place of his habitual residence.
I took the oath of office before Gen. Jackson.
The attorney of the United States has not yet arrived.”
Together with the present you will receive a packet delivered by me for you two years ago to Captain Ramage of the navy, by whom it was given to general Ripley with a request that he would forward it by mail." The Gen. neglected it, & delivered it back to me a few days before I left New Orleans. I do not now recollect the contents, but still deem it proper, late as it is, now to forward it.

Butler & till my arrival here, has exercised the functions, antecedently discharged by Governor Coppinger; thinks our Indian relations here, critical & important—He has had the best opportunity to understand this subject and of his ability & integrity in judging correctly I have no doubt—He is of opinion that an Agent should be sent amongst them.—Only, having, myself arrived here, on the 17. Inst—and being much occupied with various other affairs, I
have as yet, but an imperfect knowledge of this matter—However, delay may be detrimental, and no possible ill can result from sending such Agent—
I presume your Department have already full information on this head, and if you should feel it necessary to appoint an Agent, I will ask leave to name Captain Bell, as a person in my humble judgment every way eminently, qualified for that situation—Altho' I know his services are highly valuable to his Country in the place he now fills, yet he has a great desire to change his present station for the one above mentioned—and so far as any testimonial which I can furnish can be of service to him he freely has it—
I must again solicit your pardon for the present intrusion"—
With very distinguished consideration &c W. G. D. WORTHINGTON

<docbody>SIR-On my arrival here having no house for myself & family, I requested to have the occupancy of what is called the Government house for civil offices &c.
It is an ordinary building & only sufficient for a small family—
The officers of the Army being here first, think it should be appropriated
<pb#202 />
to them—It seems to be the general impression that the civil officers of the Government should also have some small accomodation—and I with great pleasure will abide by your decision in this affair, which seems necessary to avoid any unpleasant clashing on this subject."
With distinguished Consideration, &c.

THE HONBLE J. C. CALHOUN
[Addressed] The Honble John C. Calhoun Secretary at War Washington[ Postmarked] St Augustine August 21 Free
[Endorsed] The old Government House referred to by M Worthington if abondoned by the Military, should in my view be devoted exclusively to offices for the civil departments—This I think would be very appropriate—It is not customary I believe, for the Government to provide House accommodation for Civil Officers—it seems to be expected however, by M" Ws reference to his family's accommodation—The House is by no means small, nor is it ordinary, though at present in bad repair—
From the unmixed character of the former government at S*
Augustine, there was no distinction recognized in regard to the distribution of the public Houses—It seems to me however, that a distribution should now be made, and as all the property is in the possession of the Military, the Sec of War appears perfectly Competent to make the distribution—In doing this, office accommodation for the civil authorities should, I think, alone be afforded. The old Government House Contains 6 Spacious Rooms on two floors, and would in my opinion fully suffice for that purpose, as well as for holding the County Court which will meet there—The residue of the public Houses with the exception of the Collectors office and that part of the Custom House allotted to the reception of stores or merchandize, should remain in the possession of the Military—It may be proper to remark that there are several good rooms suitable for officers quarters in the building in which the Collectors office is kept, It appears by Cap" Bell's letter * that the Collector Considers himself entitled to them also—if he be permitted to occupy them, quarters must be rented for the Military officers—I believe however, that grade of officers (Collectors) are never furnished with accommodations of this kind as matter of right—T.

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO THE PRESIDENT BY MEMBERS OF THE PENSACOLA BAR</dochead>
<source>[NA:SD, Misc. Letters.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[August 25, 1821]</place-time>
<docbody>TO JAMES MONROE, President of the United States of America.
The Undersigned, the Members of the Bar of Pensacola, unanimously, and in the most respectful manner, represent, that they have seen, with extreme regret and mortification, the appointment, to a Judicial Office of high importance in this Province, by the Supreme Executive of the Federal Government, of a man, whose legal acquirements, and whose moral character, are equally unfitted to inspire those sentiments of respect, and that feeling of confidence, which are due to his elevated station, but which rank, however dignified, cannot alone confer. The dispensation of justice depends, not only on the wisdom and rectitude of the Bench, but on the integrity and consideration of the Bar. In a Court, in which it is deemed degrading to practice, honorable men will be reluctant to appear. Your Memorialists cannot stoop to rehearse the reports, which are in general circulation, of the unworthiness of Judge Fromentin, it is sufficient to say, that they are of a nature to arrest the attention of those, on whom rests the responsibility of selecting the public functionaries, and who have clothed him with authority—and of a currency, which if it be not conclusive evidence of their truth, is an imperative reason for their investigation. His incapacity, which might well have been argued from the defect of his education, has been rendered glaringly apparent from his first attempt to assume the exercise of power.
Under these circumstances, Your Memorialists feel themselves called upon, most respectfully, but most urgently, to remonstrate against the nomination of Eligius Fromentin to the Senate of the United States, at their next session, as a candidate for the office of District Judge of the United States, for this District, and to protest against his appointment.

<place-time>PENSACOLA Aug. 26 1821</place-time>
<docbody>THE HON" J. Q. ADAMS Secretary of State SIR. At the same time at which this will be delivered to you, you will receive, no doubt from Gen. Jackson himself a full detail of the outrage by him committed in the person of Col. Callava.” My unavailing efforts to have the Col. released only brought upon me a part of the same contumelious treatment. I am not sufficiently
<pb#205 />
acquainted with all the circumstances attending this transaction to be able to give you a complete history of it. I will then confine myself to giving you an account of the conduct which I pursued, &
which now that passion has somewhat subsided, I think upon mature reflection is the only conduct which my duty permitted me to pursue.
Early in the morning of the 23" inst. I was informed that Col.
Callava had been arrested the preceding night in his house, & carried to jail. Soon after my house was filled with people of all descriptions and languages. By degrees the crowd retired, & it was not till about eleven O clock that Mess Larua, Innerariti, D" Brosnaham & father Coleman returned to my house. The three first applied to me for a writ of habeas corpus. I knew that it was in vain, having no marshal to execute my orders, to send an individual who could have no authority to demand it, for a copy of the warrant in virtue of which Col.
Callava was detained; & that as that copy could & perhaps ought to have been refused by an officer of the army to that individual who could have no legal character to demand it, I could not from an affidavit of a refusal to deliver the copy of the warrant under those circumstances, find myself more authorised after than before such a refusal to issue the writ. And indeed could a legal demand have been made with success in the absence of a marshal from an officer of the army? Could any body have obtained from either Gen. Jackson or the officer in whose immediate custody Col. Callava was a copy of the warrant? Is it enough to have a right to trample under foot every law to place the officers charged with their execution in the impossibility of complying with the requisites of the law? Would not the same uncontrolable temper which manifested itself at the issuing of the writ, have manifested itself at the application for a copy of the warrant, which would have prevented the issuing of the writ, because nobody then could have been found to serve it? I felt anxious, Sir, after the application was made to me that the only judicial officer of the United States in West Florida, although with the consciousness of not being able to accomplish it, should do everything in his power to liberate Col. Callava from confinement. Is it fair to apply to me under the most extraordinary circumstances of difficulty the severity of the forms intended to be complied with in a state of undisturbed tranquillity?
Besides there are no indispensibly necessary formalities absolutely required previous to the granting of that writ. The form of it may The sequel of the Vidal story is of some interest. When Innerarity failed to render an accounting, the heirs brought suit. Executions were levied against him in Jan. 1822 by the Superior Court of W. Fla., and upon his refusal to pay, the sheriff levied on and took away his negroes and furniture. See John C. Connor to Jackson, Feb. 3, 1822, and George Walton to id., Feb. 4, 1822 (LC, Jackson Papers, Vol. 61).
<pb#206 />
vary a little according to the laws of the several states. Some may require security for costs, if the writ should be improperly applied for.
Others may require security that the party in the act of bringing him before the judge shall not escape. Others may require other things.
But there is not that I know of any particular prerequisite commanded by the laws or adopted by the courts of the United States, who, I
believe, follow in that respect the particular forms prescribed by the laws of the state in which an application is made for the writ. I was then in that respect bound by no precedent; & I was forced to adopt the only mode which I had it in my power to pursue.
The common law by allowing that particular writ to be served by any body and upon any body seemed to have anticipated the peculiar difficulties in which I was placed. The only question then for me to examine after a formal though verbal application was made to me, was whether I had a right to issue the writ. With that view I consulted my commission. I find myself there styled a judge of the United States authorised & empowered to execute & fulfill the duties of that office according to the Constitution and laws of the United States.
I need not say that I consulted the Constitution. But I consulted the acts of Congress, and in the 14" connected with the 13" section of the act of Sept. 24. 1789 I find that all the above mentioned courts of the United States have a right to issue the writ of Habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdiction, and agreable to the principles and usages of law.
But again, says Gen. Jackson, the writ of Habeas corpus is not extended by law to this territory; & I must confine myself to the jurisdiction given by the act of Congress in the only two cases mentioned in the act, to wit: the revenue laws, & the importation of people of color.
And could not I in return ask Gen. Jackson by what act of Congress Grand juries, & in criminal matters petty juries have been established in this territory. The general has established them. He has done right—I thank him for it. But is it more necessary for the protection of the liberties of the people that they should be tried in criminal matters by a jury than it is that they should have a remedy against the wild ravings of ungovernable tyranny? Let the events of the 22" &
I might add of the 23" & 24" days of this month answer the question.
God grant that before long a still more eloquent answer be not furnished to the question!
Yet, Sir, Determined as I was, as far as laid in my power, to endeavour to have justice done to Col. Callava, I was not less determined to have justice done to the country. I feel as deeply as any American, any attempt on the part of the agents of a foreign government, to disregard the rights of the United States. I once had an oportunity of expressing my opinion to you in writing on that very
<pb#207 />
subject. & I may safely appeal to what I wrote then for a correct expression of what I must feel in every similar case. & although I
do not believe a word of what is attempted to be laid to the charge of Col. Callava, yet in consequence of the state of agitation in which the whole country was thrown, I deemed it a duty, under the discretionary power vested in all the judges who have a right to grant the writ of Habeas corpus to require security; & I informed the friends of Col. Callava who applied to me for the writ, that I would, before setting Colonel Callava at liberty, require security for the production before me, of the papers said to be in his possession.
Security was offered to any amount. I mentioned forty thousand dollars: Col. Callava himself in twenty thousand, & the two securities in ten thousand dollars each. M. Larua & M" Innerarity agreed to become securities. I then issued the writ marked N° 1.” & delivered it to be served on the officer who had the guard of the prison where Col. Callava was confined to D. Brosnaham another of the friends of Col. Callava who had joined in applying for the writ. In the meantime I prepared a rough draft of the recognisance a copy of which is sent marked N° 2." The rough draft of that recognizance was on my table when Col. Walton came to bring me the order from Gen. Jackson to be hereafter mentioned, & I gave it to him to read.
I was engaged in making some necessary alterations in the draft of that recognisance when I received from the officer of the day the letter marked N° 3." in answer to the writ I had issued. I dropped the unnecessary labour of putting the recognizance in a better shape.
The soldier who brought me the letter of the officer of the day had scarcely left my house, when Col. Walton entered it with the written order above alluded to from Gen. Jackson to me marked N° 4.”
After some conversation with Col. Walton, in the course of which I mentioned to him what I had done & intended to do in this business, I gave him to read as before stated the rough draft of the recognizance.
I then desired him to furnish me with a certified copy of the written order which he had given me to read, & he agreed to call on me at five Oclock for my answer. He returned in about half an hour, &
gave me the written copy I had applied for. In the meantime, Having reflected on the strange message of Gen. Jackson, I determined upon writing to him the letter a copy of which accompanies this marked N° 5." About five Oclock Col. Walton returned according to promise;
& I gave him to read the letter which I had prepared in answer to the
<pb#208 />
written communication of Gen. Jackson. After reading it several times He advised me not to send it, & observed that as he himself knew that I was then suffering from a severe rheumatism which prevented me from walking, he would state the fact in his return, & that I could thus further advise what I thought best to do. This letter was not of course sent to Gen. Jackson. We had some further conversation, & at parting I told the Col. that in the situation in which I was, nothing but force would compel me to leave my house.
The Colonel made his return. I did not see him again that day;
& when night came, I anticipated a renewal of the scene of the day before, & prepared myself for the consequences. However nobody came to disturb me. The next day about noon the Col returned, &
observed that both the general & myself must be desirous of making a report of this affair to the government by the next mail; that there was no time to be lost, & that it was the general's wish that I should call at his office the next day in the morning. After the Col. had withdrawn I reflected that the state of things was now somewhat different from what it was the day before. A reason was assigned for my having an interview with the General, the force of which I
felt. and ultimately a longer resistance would only end in affording Gen. Jackson the scandalous triumph of once more trampling upon the laws of his country. I determined to go there that very afternoon;
& accordingly at about 4 O clock P. M. I went to the office of Gen.
Jackson The conversation, as you may suppose, was nearly all on one side, not unmixed with threats of what he said he had a right to do for my having dared to interfere with his authority. He asked me whether I would dare to issue a writ to be served upon the Captain General of the island of Cuba. I told him No. but that if the case should require it, and I had the necessary jurisdiction, I would issue one to be served on the President of the United States. Ultimately he wished to know the name of the persons who had applied for the writ of Habeas corpus. I unhesitatingly told them to him. Then he wished to know whether they had made the usual affidavit stating that they had been refused a copy of the warrant upon which Col.
Callava was confined. I told him No. that the application to me was a verbal one. Gen Jackson then required me to sign what I had just declared. I told him I was ready to do it; & I did it accordingly, D" Bronough who was present at the conversation having reduced that part of it to writing.
Much more was said by the General respecting the extent of his powers, the happy selection made of him by the President; the hope that no living man should ever in future be clothed with such extraordinary authority. How fortunate it was for the poor that a man of his feelings had been placed at the head of the government! &c. &c.
&c. &c. &c. The whole intermixed with or rather consisting alto-
<pb#209 />
gether of the most extravagant praises of himself, & the most savage &
unmerited abuse of Col. Callava & of myself for doing my duty in attempting to set him at liberty.
The first time the authority of Gen. Jackson is contested I should not be surprised, if to all the pompous titles by him enumerated in his order to me marked N°. 4." he should superadd that of grand inquisitor, & if finding in my library many books formerly prohibited in Spain, and among others the Constitution of the United States he should send me to the stake.
I had taken the liberty in the course of my conversation with him to contest some of the powers he assumes as governor & intendant, &c, of which legal powers both previous to and since the adoption of the Spanish constitution he appears to me not to have the remotest knowledge. As to the Spanish constitution he will not hear of it, although it was solemnly sworn to here about sixteen months ago.
Nothing will do for him but the laws which were in force in Spain on the 19* february 1819. So that the first initiation of the inhabitants of Florida in the enjoyment of liberty must be by a retrograde step from a state of comparative liberty to a state of absolute Slavery.
I attempted to represent, but he would not let me go on. Ultimately I was permitted to depart without having suffered but in my feelings as an American.
The American flag, it is true, The flag of liberty waves on our forts.
A treacherous sign in Florida, Sir. The bohon-upas tree of slavery overshadows our town.
Sirit is reluctantly that I speak thus of a man whom once I delighted to honor. But I owe you the truth, & painful as the task may be, I
must discharge my duty.” I have the honor to be with great respect Sir your most Ob.h. Servt.

<place-time>C. (Copy) [August 27, 1821]</place-time>
<docbody>Mr MAYOR & GENTLEMEN, It will be necessary, since the organization of the civil Government of East Florida, that suitable buildings, rooms and offices be procured and designated for the accomodation of its various Departments.
It can scarcely be requisite to mention that those Buildings which were heretofore appropriated to the military, or which may now be necessary for the small peace establishment which is stationed here, will not come within the scope of this communication—But as the surrender of this Province to Col. Butler rendered it fit that for the time being he should occupy for the safekeeping the public edifices—It may be well to make a general statement of everything as it has since the transfer and does at this moment exist.
I would suggest your procuring information on the following heads-
1* The National property transferred to the United States, discribing it specifically—the uses to which it was designed under the Spanish Government—the uses to which it has been assigned since and at this time—Its probable cost to the Spanish Government—
Its value now if sold on a credit of one, two, or three years—How much it would bring if rented—which are tenantable as they now are—
How much would repair them—what would be the best course for the United States to pursue with them.
2" The property belonging to the city of S’ Augustine, with the same enquiries as above, and what would be the best course for the City council to take on it.
It will occur to you that the Civil Officers of the United States must have fixed places to transact the public business—The Secretary and acting Governor of this Territory has addressed a short note to the Secretary at War by last mail to know if the Government House is to remain with the civil or the military authority"—He did this because, he has been and is still under much inconvenience for a suitable place to receive the Citizens and inhabitants of this province for the transactions of their official concerns. Altho' the Secretary of the Province can very well put up with an inconvenience of this kind, as he is not certain that he has an absolute right to demand a House either for himself and family or as an officer—Yet it is hoped that
<pb#211 />
ere long the Governor of the Floridas, acting as Captain General
&” may pay this important and interesting portion of his Territories a visit and may even prefer it as his permanent residence—He would therefore submit whether it will comport in such a probable event with the respect which is due to the chief Magistrate of these Provinces, and whether it will not unavoidably embarras the transactions of the public affairs, that no suitable place should be in readiness to receive him.
The Judge of the District Court of the United States, the Marshal, Attorney, Clerk, &", it would seem ought to have a place to hold their Court and keep their offices.
The officers of the Revenue have I believe already a place to transact the affairs of the Customs—The City council, The territorial Court of the County of S*Johns, The high Sheriff as well as other territorial officers which will occur to you, ought in some manner to be accomodated for the benefit and convenience of the people at large with the transaction of whose business [they]" are charged.
It gives me pleasure to state that Captain Bell offered me everything which he deemed within his controul to accomodate me temporarily, but as that accomodation might terminate on the arrival of Col.
Eustis here, which was daily expected, I declined placing either him or myself in a predicament which might turn out to be peculiarly delicate—Should there be any appropriate places for public worship under our system of free tolleration you will of course make particular mention of them.
A full and speedy report on this subject with a view of submitting it to the highest authority is required.
Permit me to congratulate you and the citizens of this Territory on the opening of your first sitting—I sincerely pray that your proceedings may not only redound to your own credit, but be for the benefit of all the Inhabitants of this portion of our Country—Having determined not to intermeddle with affairs, not strictly within the range of my duty, I must decline following the custom of my Spanish predecessors of Presiding in your Council—I regard your Body as of a Legislative character, mine is Executive, I shall therefore abstain as well from your duties, as I shall matters which may belong to the Judiciary—I wish you distinctly to understand that I decline no labour nor responsibility which properly may belong to me—and that I tender you at all times any services and information in my power
<pb#212 />
which you may request in aid of advancing the happiness and prosperity of this country."

As my letter to Gen' Jackson of this date gives a brief and fair account of the state of my proceedings here, I do myself the honor to enclose a Duplicate thereof, and of the several exhibits accompanying it, Marked A. C. & D. I have not at hand a complete list of the new officers, as contemplated in B, which I will forward by my next.—
I have no doubt of carrying every thing easily and happily into operation here. The Indian subject, in extenso, I shall take up as soon as I have time, as also the subject of the English wreckers,”
lining the southermost coast of Florida, and any thing else that may seem necessary. The subject of the Archives, which excites a deep and lively interest here, I understand has been by C [MS. torn] Butler lodged with our Government at Washington, and I feel bound not to move in it, till I hear their pleasure.”
If I was to give my own private opinion, I should say, had I have been the Commissioner I don't think I would have accepted the cession of the Province without them.

A passport had been issued to Chazotte by the Secretary of State on May 1, 1821 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., xix), to visit E.

[Endorsed] W. G. D. Worthington—
[Enclosure: Dup.]
Acting Governor Worthington (East Florida) to Governor Jackson
(Copy.) “B” S*AUGUSTINE, 28* August, 1821.
SIR, Neither wishing it, nor deeming it politic, when Captain Bell transferred his civil powers to me on the 20" inst, as I have already written to you that the Mayor & Council who had acted since the cession should become also instanter functus officio, I that day requested them to continue still in the Gov" and meet me at 10. A.M.
in the Council chamber on the 22" the ensuing wednesday, when I
would lay before them your ordinances or such of them as could in the interim be printed, I found that not more than one or two of them could be printed in that time, so I ordered N° 3. respecting Naturalization, to be first struck off and brought to me at the council chamber by the hour of meeting, it was so. The Mayor and Council assembled, I took my Seat as President of the Board, made a short address growing out of the Ordinances, complimented the Mayor and the other members on the late discharge of their functions, and as it was necessary to reorganize their body according to your Ordinances, hoped that they would still consent to officiate—The Mayor and everyone of the Council, with the exception of S D" Francisco J. Fatio, declined, because they said they could not at this time abjure their allegiance to the King of Spain. They were all Spanish Subjects, I did not say whether that was absolutely necessary as a preliminary to an office in this territory, they took the ground themselves, and having taken it, I did not think it essential for me to say it was not a necessary prerequisite, so I accepted of all their resignations, except Mr Fatio, who when I came to him rose up and boldly said, “Sir, I
will take the oath of allegiance to the United-States with pleasure.”
I then dissolved the meeting, and stuck up notices that the civil officers under the new organization would meet at the same place on saturday the 25* and in the most public manner take their respective oaths of office. In the interim altho' the late Mayor and council had withdrawn from being considered candidates, I determined to offer some of the most honourable and important appointments to the native
<pb#214 />
and old inhabitants of the province, and to endeavour to get a due number of Spaniards, Minorcans, French, Irish, Americans, &" into the new government if they would accept of places. I wrote a circular, of which the enclosed marked A. is a copy,” to some of the most wealthy and respectable of them to be Judges, Aldermen, & they declined it by letter on the ground that they were not prepared to abjure their subjection to the King of Spain and take the oath of allegiance to the United States, altho' you will see in my circular that it is not expressed as a prerequisite, but even if I had not thought it a prerequisite, after they had come out and said they could not take the oath of allegiance to the U. S. I could not then have thought it proper to appoint anyone of them, I then filled up the commissions in the best way I could, as you will see by the list marked B.”—Accordingly under the waving flag of the Union, on the 25" the civil officers assembled with a large concourse of people, some officers of the Army and Navy were present and forty odd Indians who had just come in.
I opened the ceremony by a short address confined to the occasion, then administered the oath to Judge Fitch, who successively swore in Col. Forbes the new Mayor and the other officers,” and the registry for naturalization was opened at the same time; the meeting was then closed, the City Council to meet on the 27* I then opened the talk with the Indians, which turned out to be not of sufficient consequence to detail to you, I requested Captain Bell to be present and to take note of it, which he did, and if anything shall grow out of it worth communicating, it will be done. On the 27” the city council met, and I sent them the enclosed Executive communication marked C*-
There is from various unofficial accounts some disturbance and distractions amongst the Indians, I shall in a few days have a Chief in, and shall endeavour to procure all necessary information, which shall be transmitted forthwith. I believe things are exaggerated by some of our countrymen who may be mischievously and illegally intermeddling amongst them, this is necessary to be known, and I will as soon as possible procure and transmit the information—I have thus briefly endeavoured to detail our acts and views consecutively as they have transpired, I will now cast an eye retrospectively by way of
<pb#215 />
recapitulating the secondary and minor incidents. With the determination agreeably to your wish of giving the appointments of prosecuting Att” and clerk of the Court of the county of S*Johns, to Major Willis, and M. Patterson. I waited a week—there are neither of them here—Judge Fitch and Captain Bell both know Mr Patterson and Major Murray, and I have thought under all circumstances, it would meet your approbation to appoint M. Murray, and have done so, but M” Gibbs is appointed with the express understanding, when Major Willis arrives to relinquish it to him—M. Gibbs is an old and respectable man, the court could not go on without these two officers, it was very requisite at this time, I hope this proceeding will meet your approbation.
Neither Judge Duval, M. Bird, M* Hackley, Col. Eustis, &" have yet arrived-I feel a perfect confidence that as the orb of our civil vernment rises and sheds its benign influence in this province, all its functions will be performed with the utmost harmony.—The civil and military spheres do not without violence interfere with each other, and I am resolved to do everything in my power which can be fairly expected from me to maintain and preserve their mutual peace and concord, I know this friendship and good will between the Citizen Soldier, and the soldier citizen in our Republic is what the President and yourself and every good and reflecting man in our Country rejoices to see. I am led to these remarks from having understood that before I arrived here there was considerable feeling excited in this city. As on occasions of this sort, generally both parties are more or less in the wrong. I did not allude to it in my last letter wishing that oblivion might weave over it, her impervious web; and to tell you the truth it is an unpleasant subject to enquire into, and I know of no good which could arise from stirring up the matter, I have declined knowing anything of the particulars, but have left them to sleep in the tomb of the Capulets.—I know that you and the General Government must dislike being uselessly troubled with such little party bickerings.
I don't know that I have any right to claim a house to keep my office in, I have therefore not made a demand, altho’ I think the old government house might have been assigned for that purpose, and as a Lieutenant and Surgeon of the troops were in it, and I understand could not give it up without an order from the Secretary of War, I wrote him the short note on the subject marked D.” Whether not only that house but the house occupied formerly by the Collector of the Customs, and some others for aught I know, are to be held by one or two persons placed in each, ’till Col. Eustis, or anyone else comes on to make his choice, and a half dozen other public buildings are to be kept 'till the troops shall want them—and all this military establishment, to
<pb#216 />
accomodate only 120. men, with a requisite number of officers, is the best disposition of those public buildings, I should suppose does not even afford a question; my own opinion is, that the Fort and its appendages, for such a place as this ought to be the only exclusive Military establishment. In time of peace the officers, if they prefer it, can find the same accomodation which they do in many other of our cities which have no exclusive quarters appropriated for them—If at any time it be necessary to remove the men from the Fort, they would be better placed on the edge, than in the heart of a city, as also hospital establishments.
I have thought it my duty to invite your attention to this subject, as you know our citizens are so very watchful and sensible to anything which should have even the slightest squinting towards a military or any other than a civil constitutional government. I
know that you would not wish any of the U. S. subordinate civil or military officers, under you; imprudently to be betrayed into any acts which might give even the captious and evil disposed anything, like a semblance, of imputation that they would wish to see the civil subordinate to the military authority, in even the most remote and recent part of our territories. This I consider would be in repugnance to the most sacred interest of the very vital genious of our country—I know in this sentiment I must have the honour to accord with you, who I understand have from your early life been bred up to expound the Laws and Constitution of our country; who in mature life, after your habits and opinion must have been all formed, laid aside the civil citizen and took upon you the Republican soldier, and now exchange the character of a victorious general for that of one of our principal civil magistrates—It is painful to me to write on this subject, because it is one which may be perverted to look more like a matter of selfishness than principle. As to myself, so far as I may be concerned, I shall with great cheerfulness acquiesce in any decision which you may think proper to make in the premises—or which may be made by the Secretary of War—I have no doubt the present state of things first grew out of the peculiar state of affairs, and is now only continued, ’till the proper authority can new model it. When the City council shall report on my communication of yesterday marked C.
I will enclose it without delay.”
I transmit you the Ordinances which have been printed N° 1. 2. 3.

<docbody>THE HONB° SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
SIR, Herewith I have the honor to enclose the copy of a letter addressed to me by M. Scott, the Collector of the Customs for this Port; it was delivered to me by his son, on the day he became of age, after we had been eight or ten days on board the Brig Enterprize *
on our passage to this place. I did not feel myself at liberty to decline administering the oaths required, untill our arrival at this place, though if there had been an ultimate option left me in the case, I
should have deemed it my duty to have deferred it untill arriving;
the oaths as subscribed by M. Scott Jun * is also enclosed, and with
<pb#219 />
the letter from the Collector will be the only evidence I have to transmit to the department, of the appointment in question.
M. Lewis " upon opening the Custom House here, appointed M Thomas Brownjohn an Inspector of the Customs; upon my arrival M. Brownjohn applied to me to be continued in the situation, upon consulting with M. Lewis on the necessity & propriety of employing two Inspectors of the Customs here at this time, it was determined that in the course of a very short time it would be indispensable to the security of the Revenue, that an Inspector should be stationed at the Barancas (in the immediate vicinity of the entrance to the Bay on which this Town is situated) whose duty would be to board all Vessels coming in the harbour, and by his presence become a check upon the accomplishment of the illicit intentions of the ill disposed, as well as to be so situated that by opportunely employing any leisure time with a Boat at his command, a watchful eye might be kept upon the numerous inlets upon this Coast, situated in an Easterly direction, within the limits of this district. Mr Brownjohn has accordingly been retained, his vigilance, intelligence and activity have already been of essential service, and I have to request your approval of his appointment as Inspector of the Customs at this port.
From the information I have been able to collect from persons acquainted with the navigation of the coast of West Florida, there arises a strong presumption that the employment of a Revenue Cutter on this station," will be perhaps indispensable, and one of a force superior to either of those now empleyed engaged either on the Mobile or Mississippi district; a row boat is already much wanted, for the Custom house hitherto the Inspectors have been able to hire one for the occasion as requisite, but the practice if continued, will be found bad economy. I would request your approval of the disbursement requisite for the purchase of a boat adapted to the use for which she will be required. I have embraced this occasion to make the above suggestions, in anticipation of the instructions with which I may be honored, from your department; upon the receipt of those, I shall feel myself more at liberty to enter into a detail of ment 62520, Mar. 15, 1833; both in NA, HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.; act approved Mar. 2, 1833, 6 STAT. 542). Mrs. Scott later sought unsuccessfully to obtain the payment by the Government of interest on the sum paid her under the act of Mar. 2, 1833 (bills and a petition referred on Dec. 13, 1837 are in NA, HF, 25
Cong., 2 sess.; House Journal 24 Cong., 2 sess., p. 80, 25 Cong., 2 sess., p. 71).
<pb#220 />
some points relative to this port and district as a component part of our sea board, to which the special attention of the officers of the revenue may be presumed to be directed; if however, those already appointed to this district should all arrive here, the prospect at present warrants me in remarking that they will have but little business to attend to for some time to come.

<dochead>REPORT OF ST. AUGUSTINE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC PROPERTY</dochead>
<source>[LC: Jackson Papers, Vol. 60: C]</source>
<place-time>[September 9, 1821]</place-time>
<docbody>Report—The undersigned Members of the Committee appointed by a resolution of the Honorable City Council to prepare a report in compliance with the requests contained in an official communication to the Council from W. D. G. Worthington Esq” Secretary and acting Gov' of East-Florida dated August 27** having been duly qualified proceeded to obtain information on the following heads as recommended in his letter of that date: “1” The national property transferred to the United States describing it specifically: the uses to which it was designed under the Spanish Government: the uses to which it has been assigned since, and at this time: its probable Cost to the Spanish Government: its value now if sold on a credit of One two and three years; how much it would bring if rented: what are tenantable as they now are: how much would repair them: what would be the best Course for the United States to pursue with them.
2" The property belonging to the City of St. Augustine with the same Enquiries as above; and what would be the best course for the City Council to take on it.”
In the first place your Committee beg leave to observe that their Statement as contained in the Report while answering as far as practicable to the enquiries on the general state of Public property does not distinguish the Class or denomination it may fall under whether National or Municipal: It has been impracticable for the Committee to act otherwise from the peculiar form of, and measures adopted by the former Government; the Governor or person in chief command assuming as a general maxim that whatever did not appertain to an Individual necessarily fell to the King, and regardless of
<pb#221 />
the Rights of the City as a Corporate Body, crowded every public building with idle Soldiery till crumbling in ruins over thier heads they were forced to abandon them: In like manner we find transferred as National property Public Squares, which were always intended for the Ornament Salubrity and Utility of the City: the Catholic Church, a building raised by individual Subscription and belonging to the Catholic Congregation, the Burying Ground of the same which was the Donation of a charitable person, and other similar inconsistencies.
In this investigation the Committee have taken for their guide the Iventory of Public property delivered over by the Spanish Engineer,"
and marked N° 3 in the list of documents accompanying the communication from the Executive, but their labours have been much impeded from the want of the several plans delivered up with that document, particularly the General plan of the Town, to which continual reference is made in the Inventory, and upon which it appears all the public property was distinctly marked: these plans it seems were taken away from St. Augustine by the United States Commissioner who received the * [Public property from the Spanish Authorities, and unfortunately no copies whatever were made, and nothing has been left to supply their place: It is more peculiarly unfortunate that no plan remains of any description to serve as a guide in the decisions upon the various conflicting interests, which necessarily will come in contact in explaining N° 21. of the Inventory before mentioned, in which it is specifically stated that within the limits of the City there are many pieces of ground occupied by individuals who have no good Title thereto and that all such are to be considered as Public property and forming part of the formal delivery: in the same manner there is stated to be a piece of ground between the Powder Magazine and Fort Maria Sanchez as Public Property without defining its limits.—
The Committee respectfully submit the following abstractresult of their enquiries classed under the different heads as requested, accompanied by their observations thereon: The Numeration of the Public property in this abstract is the same as in the Engineers Inventory aforesaid N° 3; in which the said property will be found to be Specifically described."—
N° 1. The Fort. As no doubt can exist as to this, & as it is intirely within the Controul of the military the Committee have nothing to observe hereupon
<pb#222 />
N° 2. The Lines. At present the Lines are considered as being occupied by the military: whether it be elligible or not to keep them in repair is not the object of the Committee to enquire, but as the Guard at the Gate of the Town is no longer continued and as the Guard House is placed in the middle of the Street obstructing the way and becoming a nuisance, the Committee would recommend the removal thereof immediately N° 3. The Powder Magazine & Guard House. As only a small quantity of damaged powder is deposited in this building and as much inconvenience is felt for want of a Public Prison, the Committee strongly recommend its temporary appropriation for that purpose The Guard House might well serve as a kitchen for the Jailor and the Magazine is well adapted as a place of Security.—
N° 4. The Burnt Barrack Lot.—The old chimnies remaining on the Ground were sold some years back to M' Gay: The Lot is recommended by the Committee for Sale.—
N° 5. The Old Convent.—The Committee have directed considerable attention to this Building from a conviction of the great general uses to which it might be appropriated if put in good repair: The walls appear generally to be good with a few exceptions which might be easily and substantially remedied.—
There are] Eight large Saloons on the upper Story: the four on the Wings 50 ft. by 24: the four central ones 36. feet by 24; and a similar distribution on the Ground floor: a thorough repair of the Roof, new laying the floors, new doors and Windows and other repairs to make the Building serviceable would probably occasion an expence of $6,000; which would be amply repaid by the accommodations it would afford for every branch of National, Territorial and Civic Business; but about one half of the above sum would place it for immediate purposes in tolerable good order: The Spacious Court Yard in the rear and its Eligible situation would probably make it even more adapted for a College than any, other purpose, at all events its immediate repair is an object of the first importance.
Contiguous to this old Convent is a large range of old Stone Offices totally in ruins: The Committee beg leave to recommend that an immediate Sale of the materials be made, to be of course removed, as in their present state they are a nuisance, and the sum of 600$ at least would be obtained therefrom.
N° 6. The Government House. This Building was alway occupied as the residence of the Governors of this Province until falling into decay it was considered only fit to have the habitable Rooms appropriated for Soldiers quarters: but the late Governor had not long since, began to make considerable repairs to it, and had entertained the intention of moving into it had not the Evacuation of the Province taken place: The Committee have estimated the Sum of $2000 as
<pb#223 />
necessary to complete the repairs and make this Building suitable for a Town-Hall and City Offices; or as a State-House for Territorial purposes, or for the accomodation of Public Officers: at present it affords quarters to five Officers of the United States Troops. The lot being very spacious other Buildings might be Erected there as required.
N°7 The Custom House. &c. This Building consists of two Wings:
The Southern wing in its upper part furnishes Offices for the United States revenue; the lower part is a Guard-House which will evidently be required for the City Patrol: the northern wing is occupied as quarters by the Commanding Officer of the Garrison above, and as the United-States Stores below. Whether this Building is necessary or not for the small peace Establishment now stationed here the Committee are unable to say, but all the other public buildings are so completely ruinous that in the event of the arrival of the Chief Magistrate, this would be found to be the only one immediately tenantable.
N° 8. The National School. The Committee recommend that this Building continue as a temporary accommodation for the City Council above; and that the lower part be appropriated for the present for holding the Territorial Court: And the Committee cannot point out for Divine worship on the Sabbath any Rooms more appropriate than these.
N° 9. The Black-Smiths Shop or Smithy. The Committee recommend the Sale of this lot; it is however their duty to observe that the Smith placed there by the Spanish Government was induced (from hopes held out to him of having an absolute grant of the whole for Services) to make considerable additions to the lot and buildings, the value of which the Committee estimate at $200; which improvements the Committee recommend to be retained and not taken away, and that the Smith be reimbursed the above sum out of the proceeds of the sale of the lot and Building N° 10. The Burnt Hospital lot. The Committee recommend this lot and the ruins thereon to be sold.
N° 11. Hospital and Shop. The Committee beg permission most strongly to recommend the removal of this Hospital from the Centre of the Town to a place where it might be established with propriety:
(see N° 20.) Its situation in so public a place is evidently improper and even indecent. The lot is recommended for sale, the present ruinous state of the Building not justifying the expence of repairs.
Should any interval occur between the removal of the Hospital and the Sale, the Rooms are well adapted for temporary public Offices.
N° 12. Dragoon Barracks. Recomended to be sold.
N° 13. Old Powder-House. This old building is situated in the Centre of a Lot containing about 10 acres of land whose value is esti-
<pb#224 />
mated at $100. p" acre: the remote situation, the absolute ruin of the House, and the lowness of the Ground do not Justify a higher value:
The Committee recommend that it be sold.
N° 14 The Look-out Tower. Not conceived within the scope of N° 15 Matanzas Tower. J this report.
No 16. The old Church lot. Recommended to be sold.
N°17. The Market Place. The small wooden buildings & Sheds erected on this public square are strongly recommended by the Committee to be removed as a public nuisance. They were always considered as temporary and liable to be taken away at a moments notice: they produce little or no revenue and spoil the appearance of the Square. The Stone market may remain till a more suitable place can be provided.
No 18. The Catholic * These are considered private prop-
No 19. Cemetery. erty.
No. 20. Flour Magazine. This Building is occupied by the families of two or three Soldiers of the United States Troops. It is extremely well calculated for an Hospital: at all events the Committee strongly recommend the immediate removal to this building for the present of the Sick from their present situation in the centre of the town.
N° 21. Squares and Public places. &c. As no specific definition of most of these places is given, as as no plan is here to assist the Committee, they can only mention the Square in front of the Government House and the one between the Burnt Barracks lot and old Convent, both of which have always been public Squares they recommend to be kept as such for the salubrity and Ornament of the City: With respect to the large portion of Land situated to the North of the Lines and within the precincts of the City, the Committee are of opinion that for the present it be considered as the Town Common.
From the foregoing exposition it is Evident that few if any Buildings are suitable for the well accomodation of the various departments:
consisting generally of large lots and ruinous Edifices, they are in their present state almost useless although they swell the Inventory and appear of importance: The Committee respectfully recommend the Sale of many of them, and the appropriation of the proceeds to the thorough repair of the Buildings retained. By this a noble range of Public Halls for every purpose would be obtained without expence, thereby conferring there an honor on the Corporation and becoming an Ornament to the Town and an Enhancement of the Province.
The old Convent (N° 5) or even the one half thereof would form an elegant and Spacious College, and situated on the most airy spot of this Montpelier of North-America would draw Students from all parts of the Southern Sections of the Union. The Committee refrain from detailing the advantages that would arise from the redemption of the
<pb#225 />
Marsh in the rear of the Town, as they have for the causes before stated no means of ascertaining whether it is public or private property.
The Committee cannot close this report without respectfully and earnestly recommending that measures be adopted for the return of the Plans originally delivered by the Spanish Government to the United States Commissioners and also of Stating that among the Archives not given up by the Ex-Governor, there is a large mass of Documents exclusively appertaining to the Office of the City Engineer which are of the utmost importance both to the Corporation and to the Territorial Government: but of which no public mention or intention of delivery has been made *

<docbody>HON. J. CALHOUN Sec. at War.
SIR, By last mail I received enclosed to me by Capt" Bell," commanding, and executing the civil government at S* Augustin, the unauthorised talk held by Horatio Dexter and M. Wanton, with what they are pleased to call the king of the Siminoles and fifty four of the principal indians present. It appears that this talk with the Seminoles, has been forwarded to some of the departments, whether to you is not mentioned, and were it not for its novelty, and the object which appears obvious, I should not have troubled you with the transmission of such a paper, or with any comments upon it. The object of this unauthorised proceeding appears to me, evidently to be, first, on the part of Dexter & Wanton to obtrude themselves on the notice of the Government, and secondly, to impress on the minds of the Indians, their absolute right to the country. I have written to Mr Worthington to seize these self made Indian agents,” and detain them until the instructions of the Government can be had. And this talk proves the necessity of Congress taking the subject up, and by law prescribing bounds to the Seminoles.
<pb#226 />
The exposed situation of the Floridas, imperiously demands, that its frontier upon the coast, if it may be so expressed, should be immediately inhabited by our white citizens. The Indians, at present, are scattered from Florida Point to the Chactahatchy. If you attempt to concentrate or consolidate them, at the Micksucky Pond, or Old Towns, you offend those that are situated on the Suwaney, on the Latchua Plains, or on the Peninsula. As they have been continually at war with the United States, until conquered in the Spring of 1818, when they were ordered up above the Florida line where the nation to which they originally belonged, was willing to receive them, such a measure would reconcile all. This is what they expected, and what good policy and the safety of the Georgia frontier required. But this is what these unauthorised Indian agents, who offer their services to both parties, as I conceive, wish to prevent, and on which the Government ought seriously to reflect. The Government cannot turn the torrent of emigration to the Floridas without great expence;
good policy and the safety of the frontier, in my opinion, require that the govenmet should promote emigration to this country, and hasten its admission as a State into the Union.
If the Indians be removed within the limits of the country assigned to the Creek nation, (of which the Seminoles are a part,) this object, on which the security of the Southern border so much depends, will be speedily attained. With what pretence of justice can those who fled from the Creek nation, and kept up an exterminating war on our frontier until crushed by the arm of our government in 1818, set up such claims? And is the safety of our frontier to be jeopardised by the complaints of a few indians excited by would be indian agents, and indian treaty makers, who compose flowry talks for them and put words into their mouths they never conceived, and make indian chiefs to suit their own views, and who were never heard of as such before? The greater part of the indians now in the Floridas consist of those who fled in the manner already mentioned, and why should we hesitate to order them up at once, when the Executive goverment with the aid of Congress, can do ample justice, by law if necessary, justiee to those who deserve it, by giving such equivalent as will enable them to settle their families [indecipherable word crossed out] in the upper country, and to cultivate their farms. Unless the Indians be consolidated at one point, where is the country that can be brought into market, from which the five millions are to be raised, to meet the claims of our citizens under the late treaty with Spain?
I received by last mail a letter from M. Peniers of the 14" of May last,” and another of the tenth of July.” By the latter, he informs
<pb#227 />
me he is about to proceed to the Havanna to enquire whether any treaties have been made with the Indians by Spain. Whether this be in pursuance of instructions from you, I am not advised; but surely the Government of the United States, is competent to regulate the concerns of these indians and mete to them every justice to which they are entitled, and to make such regulations as the safety of the frontier may require, without referrence to any treaty with Spain, and particularly when it is notorious, that the greater part of those Indians, as already observed, fled from the creek nation in 1813 and
1814, adhered to our enemies, continued their warefare under the excitement of British agents and Spanish incendiaries, until the United States from self defence were compelled to chastice and conquer them.
I have made enquiries for a proper character duly qualified to act as interpreter for M'Peniers. It requires, as M. Peniers does not speak english, that that interpreter should speak, the English, Indian, and French languages. Such a one is difficult to be found, in short I can hear of none but M'Hambly, and for him I have sent, but am informed that he is with the Creek agent. I advised you in my last that the indisposition of M"J. would compel me to travel with her as soon as her health would permet, out of this Southern climate; and this would prevent me from holding a treaty with the indians, although to speak candidly I am determined never to be concerned in another. I do think it not only useless but absurd. When Congress has the power to regulate all Indian concerns, by act of Congress, and the arm of the government is sufficiently strong to carry such regulations into effect.
More general justice can be done to the Indians, in this way than by treaty. When the policy of treating with the indians was first adopted it was at a time when we found them thrown upon our hands by the treaty of 1783, without any provision being made for them, and at that time they were numerous and hostile, while the arm of the government was too weak to enforce such regulations as justice and good policy required, hence the necessity of managing them by treaties. But this has passed away, the arm of government is sufficient to protect them and to carry into execution any measures called for by justice to them, or by the Safety of our frontier borders. Hence the absurdity of holding treaties with indian tribes within our territorial limits, subject to our sovregnty and municipal regulations, and to whom, by legislation, every justice can be done, and the safety of our Southern frontier perfectly secured.
These were some of the reasons that weighed upon my mind for addressing the government on this subject last Spring, in hopes that I would be authorised by the Executive to have carried into full effect the orders I had given them in 1818, and which had been given after consulting the chiefs of the Creek nation and finding it to be
<pb#228 />
their wish and that they were willing to receive them. At that time many of them went up and I am informed are now living happily there. I pray you to look at the map of the Floridas and you will at one glance see that to locate them in the Floridas, they will greatly weaken your frontier, when by removing them you clear the Southern borders of all Indians.”
Since writing the foregoing, I have made enquiry respecting Dexter, and Wanton, and am informed by a gentleman on whom, from his character and standing in Society every reliance can be placed, that those persons are profligate characters, and are and have been engaged in forming a settlement a settlement in the Alatchua plains under the grant of the duke de Alagon, and it is said have obtained a grant from the indians by deed duly executed before witnesses, relinquishing to them all indian claim to a large tract of country. From the bare reading of Dexters letter, and the Indian talk, I was impressed with the belief that Mess” Dexter, and Wanton were just such characters as above described, and in whom no confidence ought to be placed, and who ought, as I have directed, to be sent beyond the Floridas.
Nothing more clearly proves the imperious necessity of ordering those deluded Indians to the upper country, where they can be kept clear of such improper and mischievous influence, where they can be protected and made happy by the bounty and humanity of of our Governmt”

<docbody>SIR/ By a letter received by last mail from Captain J. R. Bell *
commanding Officer at St Augustine and exercising in your absence, the duties of Secretary of East Florida, with the powers of the former Governor I am advised of your just having arrived in the Bay of St Augustine, I therefore hope you are safely landed and now exercising the duties assigned you agreeably to my several letters" of instructions up to the 27" of July,” the receipt of which have been acknowledged by Captain Bell and likewise my communications of the 13" of August * and 1" of Sept’ ” the first of which was forwarded by Mr Bird district Attorney of East Florida and the other by mail, which I
hope have reached you, and to which I refer you.
Capt" Bell has forwarded me a talk held with the Indians by M"
Wanton and Horatio S. Dexter; you will immediately make enquiry by what authority they held this talk, and if unauthorized, you will immediately have them arrested and sent beyond the limits of the Floridas; for individuals unauthorized by the Government, must not be permitted to hold talks with the Indians as much injury may result therefrom and I confidently rely upon your preventing it in future.
I have been authorized to appoint an Agent to hold a conference with the Indians within the Floridas—But until M Penniers the Sub Agent of Indian Affairs arrives or until I hear from the Government to whom I have written for instructions on this subject I shall neither appoint an Agent or attempt to convene the Indians—indeed they are so scattered over the Floridas that it would be impossible at this season to collect them.

rupted by the Whites, and if they remain, it is absolutely necessary that they should be concentrated at some point, which will create as much dissatisfaction, as if they had at once been removed, where they must ultimately be located—in the Creek nation—You can assure them that they will be justly dealt with, but that they must recollect, they had commenced and continued upon our frontier inhabitants, an exterminating war, to which they had been excited by British and Spanish Agents until in 1818 the U.S. were compelled to chastise and subdue them when they were ordered up to the Creek Nation, as one of the conditions upon which peace was granted them—The greater part of the Indians now in the Floridas are those who fled from the Creek Nation in 1814 when that nation was subdued and peace granted; they cannot now expect to be indulged by being permitted to remain in the Floridas. whatever the Government may grant to those who were at that time settled there—On this subject I
am awaiting the instructions of the President of the U.S. and so soon as received you shall be advised of them; in the mean time you will do every thing in your power to Keep them peaceable, and remove from the Floridas any selfcreated agents or treaty makers, whom you may find among the Indians.

<source>[NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., J. 43:LS]</source>
<place-time>PENSACOLA Sept 20* 1821</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Since I closed my letter of the 17* inst.” to you, Neamothla, one of the chiefs of the Florida Indians, accompanied by the Mulatto chief and John Blount with an Interpreter, Stephen Richards, have visitted me. From the enclosed talk held with them marked, A,”
you will discover the object of their visit, their disposition and wishes.
They have left me, well pleased, and happy to hear that a country will be given them some where by the President of the U States, in which they will be collected and settled, and receive the protection of the U
States. They acknowledge that it is just, that those who rejected peace when it was offered to them, and fled from their own country, continuing the war, ought to return to their own nation, that they believe all those are willing to return, but are afraid, that they will not be protected.
<pb#231 />
I have written to Gen" M*Intosh " on this and other subjects, a copy of which I also enclose you; I have no doubt, it being made known to them through the Agent of the Creek nation, that they must return and that on their return they will be protected, the whole would immediately move up, and as these Indians can have no claim to lands in the Floridas, humanity and justice is sufficiently extended to them by such permission to return, and live in peace with their own nation, and their nation cannot complain or object to this.
There is but one point at which the natives of Florida can be concentrated, without weakening the borders of Florida too much, and that is, on the banks of the Appalachicola adjoining the southern boundary of Alabama and Georgia, and running down the river on both sides so as to include a sufficient area for the real natives of that country. This might infringe a little upon the large grant to Forbes and Co." but it would be better thus, than leave St. Augustine and Pensacola exposed—There a white settlement would be interposed between them and the sea shore, and the Georgia and Alabama settlements in their rear, would insure peace with them. I have thought proper to make this suggestion for the consideration of the President, and I am sure it will give general satisfaction to the Indians, if Congress will lay off a boundary for them where I have suggested; but still, I am of opinion, from the smalness of their numbers, and the shape of the Floridas that it would be much better policy to move them all up, and amply provide for them by an annuity.
I have directed the chiefs to send the talk required to this place, it will follow me and I can send it on to the President through you, and as soon as it is received, the President can take such an order upon it as he may deem most proper. I have assured them that he will either send an agent to give them a talk, or invite the chiefs to Washington;
they are content either way, but expressed a wish that they might be invited to proceed to the City of Washington—on the latter course being adopted, it would be well that they should be there when Congress is in Session, and that Congress should pass the law whilst they are there.
Neamothla requested, that Isaae Stephen Richards might be his Interpreter, to hold the talks with the other tribes, that he had hired
<pb#232 />
him to come here, and hoped I would request his father the President that he would pay him for it: I answered, that I would make it known to his father the President, and I had but little doubt he would order Mr Richards to be paid for coming here with him; that I approved his selecting M Richards as Interpreter, and would make it known to his Father. I hope this request may be granted; I have furnished them with provisions, paid their tavern bill, and gave them one dollar to pay their passage across the Bay—they have left me in a good humour and well satisfied.
Referring to my last letter with which this is enclosed, ”I gave you some information of the attempt of Dexter and Wonton to establish themselves on the Alatchua plains under a Spanish grant;
to give you further information on this subject I enelese send you an extract of a letter to me from a gentleman of high standing and character who has visitted that country,” and in whose veracity every confidence may be placed. When Congress meets, every care ought to be taken by law to put down all such fraudulent Spanish Grants, of which there will be found hundreds, and in the meantime to protect the title when possession is had agreeably to the Spanish Law, and in no other case whatever ought titles to be made valid.
Mr George I. Brown of Baltimore son of Doctor Brown of that place, has lately explored the country on the St Johns River; he returns to Baltimore, is intelligent and can give a very satisfactory account of things as they are there, is of a good character, is about to move to the Floridas, and if the Government has any use for an Agent, in him, from letters to me it will find a faithful and capable agent.
From the information of Capt Bell, I am fearful that Mr Penneers will not answer the expectations of the Government.
Extract, before alluded to, “In compliance with your wish I herewith place before you such information of the Alatchua country as I became acquainted with during my residence in East Florida.
In the month of April last, I proceeded to the S" Johns accompanied by Horatio Dexter to his residence six miles south of Lake George—
On our arrival we found the gentleman who took charge of the establishment during M* Dexters absence extremely unwell, and at the urgent solicitation of M. Dexter I agreed to remain a short time as it was necessary for him to accompany the chiefs of the Seminoles to St Augustine, whose object was to ascertain from Gov” Coppinger what provisions were made for them by the Spanish Government, and to be informed ef by what title the whites had taken possession and were forming settlements in the Alatchua country. The chiefs Pond Governor, Coosa, Taskchee and two others whose names I do not recollect visitted the Governor who informed them that
<pb#233 />
the title to the Alatchua was granted by the Cap" Gen" of Cuba to a M* Aredondo a resident of St Augustine. Alatchua is represented as a very fertile district, and as an inducement to settlers the proprietors M* Wonton, Dexter, Aredondo and Mitchell * have offered fifty acres of land to those who may agree to reside there. M* Wonton who is well known among the Seminoles and who has great influence among them has established a store for the supply of the Indians. In May last, the chiefs met M* Wonton and Dexter, and held a talk with them, and at the same time recognised the right of the proprietors to the grant, stipulating also that a store properly supplied with essentials should be Kept in the Alatchua”.—
I shall leave this early in October to carry my family home; but should information make it necessary for my return I will do so, not otherwise. Doc" Bronough will proceed with me and continue his journey to the city—by him I shall forward my resignation to the President, to be laid before Congress, that another may be appointed—My labours have been great and very fatiguing."

<place-time>S‘AUGUSTINE Sept. 27" 1821.</place-time>
SIR, Lieut Colonel Eustis has placed in my hands two communications from you of this date,” addressed to him as commanding United States Troops in S Augustine; one covering a letter from the City.
Council of S’ Augustine, stating that “unless another place be procured, if the present Council-Chamber is to be taken possession of by the United States Troops, they must relinquish their commissions”.
The other enclosed “a Resolution of the Board of health of this City of this date requesting the removal of the Hospital from the Centre of this City.
My letter of this date addressed to his Honor the Mayor is signed officially as Capt commanding; ” which the Committee appointed by the Council, submitted to you with theirs, I am at a loss to divine the reason of your addressing Col'Eustis as commanding, unless you would believe me capable of imposing a communication on the Mayor under an official Signature, unauthorised or assumed.—The Colonel's reply to your communications above alluded to * will satisfy you, that I have yet the honor to Command “the detachment stationed at Fort St Marks”.
On your arrival in this City, you found me provisionally acting as Secretary of the Province, vested with all the powers of the late Governor Coppinger, by a commission from Gen' Jackson Governor of the Provinces; from me you received all the instruments, documents, ordinances and instructions for your information and Government, which had come into my possession from the American commissioner, and Governor Jackson—In none of them do you find any authority given you, or the City-Council to take possession of, or in any way to occupy the public property and edifices, on the contrary you find by the American Commissioner's letter dated 11* July addressed to me” where he says “The establishment of the Pilots will necessarily meet your attention, and you will make such disposition of the Public-property until you receive formal instructions as will best secure it from injury having regard to the circumstances in which some of it is placed by Settlers Occupying it, under the permission of the Spanish Authorities”.—When the City Council was about to be organized under your Jurisdiction, the Key of the door of the Council
<pb#236 />
Chamber (as it is styled) was delivered to his Honor the Mayor with a perfect understanding that it could be occupied for the use of the Corporation until it became necessary to remove the troops from the Fort, which I anticipated must take place in consequence of the dampness of the Casemates occupied by them and a want of a circulation of air and I am confident of having named my apprehensions to you on that subject as well as to most of the members composing the Council—This same building was occupied by the Spanish Troops on our taking possession; and was afterwards occupied by the Same Company now ordered to it from the fort. Now by what right you or the City Council you have to Occupy that Edifice to the exclusion of the Military I leave to you to shew, for I do assure you so long as I have the honor to Command “the System which has been adopted here” will be “still persisted in respecting the public property” until otherwise directed by the proper Authority.—An appeal to the President of the United States if founded in fact, cannot Shew a want of respect on our part to the “Civil powers”.—And I assure you, altho’
I have been Styled a “young officer” that Such a threat does not alarm one, who has served his Country from the Burning sands of Louisina to the frozen Banks of the St Lawrence within the last twelve years.
The Board of health, it will be recollected is composed of the City Council with the addition of a Doctor Stone who is resident Physician of this City—This resolution after the letter addressed to you, of the same date on the subject of the Council Chamber being about to be Occupied by the Troops exhibits a feeling and disposition on the part of that honorable body, which I am truly sorry to see—“taking into connection” the two Documents produced by the same body and both growing out of the letter addressed by me to the Mayor informing him of the necessity of our Occupying the building Known as the “National School” certainly evinces a disposition hostile to the Military on this Station, and that evidently countenanced in your communications now before me. For you not only fully sanction the measures proposed by this seemingly irritated Council, but you use threats which we are not accustomed to hear from officers in your responsible situation—That the present situation of the hospital “is Contrary to the salubrity thereof and injurious to the health and Conforts of the inhabitants” or that a malignant fever exists there, requires more proof in my opinion than the mere opinion of the board of health—
Some facts should be stated of the existence of malignant disease among the Soldiers in hospital before it can be removed, as also that it is injurious to the health and comfort of the inhabitants, have they Complained? I apprehend not—One Soldier only has died in the hospital since this place has been occupied by the United States Troops, and that death Occurred shortly after our landing—does this
<pb#237 />
look like malignant disease? the disease I fear as far as it respects the hospital, was only imaginary with the Honble the Council.—
I call on you as the patron and protector of the Charity Society of this City to provide some Suitable place for reception of the persons, objects, who from misfortune or otherwise are obliged to ask Assistance from that Society, and have been received into the Army hospital; the illiberal to say the least of it report of the Board of health makes it necessary for us to prohibit any other patients in the hospital than those of the Army *
Under a firm conviction that “the System” I have pursued will meet the approbation of my Superiors I have the Honor to Subscribe myself Yours very respectfully Signed JN" R. BELL Capt. 4* Art Com"

<docbody>CAPTAIN JN° R BELL St Augustine SIR, I have received your letters of the 3" Sept** & 28 August '
with their enclosures, in relation to the Indians in Florida.
It would seem from your Statement as well as from other Sources of information that the Seminole Indians have been most shamefully imposed on and barbarously treated both by the Creek Indians and unprincipled individuals. As little as their past conduct has entitled them to the kindness of the U States, now they have been brought under their protection the government will extend towards them the same justice and generosity which it always has towards the other Indian tribes within our limits.
It is unfortunate that the sickness of M. Penieres has prevented him from reporting personally to General Jackson so as to have had
<pb#240 />
the advantage of his orders in discharge of his duties as Sub Agent.
It will be now impracticable for him to report personally to him as he will leave Pensacola for Nashville about the begining of next month;
and it will be necessary that some one should be appointed under whose instruction his duties may be performed. Having every confidence in your good Sense you have been Selected for that purpose, and I have enclosed to you a temporary appointment as Agent; and M. Penieres has been directed to report to you for orders and directed to submit his accounts and disbursements to you for approval.” You will with as little delay as practicable repair to the Seminole Indians to be accompanied by the Sub agent and ascertain their actual condition and disposition towards the U States. For this purpose you are authorized to convene the chiefs, and if you should deem it advisable, the Warriors and explain to them fully their present relation to the U States and their intention towards them. The U States consider them under their protection & will extend towards them, if they demean themselves peaceably, the same justice and liberality, that they have done to other tribes within their limits; and have viewed with great disapprobation the injustice and imposition, which has been practised on them by unprincipled individuals. They particularly regret the conduct of the party of Creeks, who lately made a plundering excursion into their Country and of which the Creek Agent has been informed. Should they attempt to repeat their excursion they will be held responsible for the consequence. The government expects that the Slaves who have run away or been plundered from our Citizens or from Indian tribes within our limits will be given up peaceably by the Seminole Indians when demanded through the Agent and satisfactory proof made of the fact.
You will ascertain their opinion of the extent of Country held by them, and on what condition they hold it, and without stating the ultimate determination of the Government urge on them the propriety on their own account, either to join the Creeks who I understand will receive them, or to concentrate their people in one place and become peaceable and industrious farmers. The former would be more for their interest, and it is hoped they may make Some arrangements with the Creeks, for that purpose, which, if they do, the Government will agree to make them such indemnity for the lands and improvements which they own in Florida as may be just. I will refer you to the instructions of M* Penieres” and Gen' Jackson * of which I enclose you Copies, as an additional illustration of the views of the government in relation to these Indians.
It is, I find indespensible to their quiet that unprincipled traders
<pb#241 />
and other individuals be removed from among them. None have a right to remain without your license or that of the Governor; and you will notify such individuals whom you may find living among them of the necessity of obtaining license and will remove such as do not obtain them within a reasonable period to be prescribed by you, taking care to grant them only to those in whose character you may confide. The notoriously bad you will cause to be removed without delay.
I perceive by the letter of Dexter that he appears to act by a power delegated to him by the Seminole Indians." Neither he or any other can exercise such delegated authority with out the sanction of the Government. Correct information is desired from any source, but the Indians must be made to understand that no one has a right to exercise authority for them but such as the government may appoint.
Such opposition of authority is one of the means by which unprincipled individuals are enabled to fleece these poor ignorant creatures; and it is proper to observe without forming any opinion as to his Character, that it has been stated that Dexter is one of those individuals who has been speculating on the Indians both in the purchase of Negroes and pretended purchases in land.
You will give the Sub agent such special instructions as you may judge proper, reporting the same to this Department. You will find him intelligent and not wholly destitute of a knowledge of the Indian Character among whom he has resided for several years and if properly supported by your authority and orders will be very useful. The place of his residence will be of some importance, and you will report to this Department at what point it ought to be fixed with your reasons for the same. I furnish you with a list," (one from Col:
Arbuckle" & the other from the Creek Agent") of Negroes taken from the Seminole Indians by a party of Creeks; by which it would seem that many of them belong to the Inhabitants of Florida. I have referred the subject to the President and have directed the Agent to hold them in his possession till further orders which when received will be communicated to you.
You will be reimbursed your necessary expenses in performing the duties which have been assigned to you as agent, and will be allowed
<pb#242 />
at the rate of three dollars a day while actually engaged. You will render your Accounts properly certified and supported by the necessary vouchers to this Department for settlement and when absent from your post on the duties of your Agency, will duly report the same to the proper Officer. I have transmitted One thousand Dollars in account to meet the disbursements which may be necessary.
It is confidently expected that your energy and good sense, will speedily afford to the Seminole Indians that protection and sense of security which they appear to stand in so much need of and that your report will furnish full and satisfactory information in relation to their situation and disposition I have &"

<docbody>GEN' JACKSON TO THE SEC OF E. FLORIDA—
SIR, I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your several letters of the 21** & 28" of August last " with their enclosures, which are just at hand, and wishing to answer by the return mail which closes at 12 Oclock I have but a moment to glance over them—
I am fully satisfied with your organisation of the Government—it surely would be viewed a great absurdity to see an American Government executed by Spanish Officers—It could only be intended, that the Spanish Officer might be continued, on his swearing allegiance to the U States, and under its authority, taking the oath of Office.
I regret that M Bird has not reached you, by him I wrote you on this subject.” You have fully met my views in the organisation you have given to the Government of East Florida, and the appointments you have made I feel grateful for your attention to my sollicitude for Maj. Willis, he has been left out of Service and is now cast upon the world for a support, when he least expected it—poor and pennyless he will be on as soon as he can travel there from the Bay of St Louis—
The military authority is subordinate to the civil, and bound upon your requisition to furnish any guard or command that may be necessary to carry your orders into full execution, and I am certain from the character of the Officers who command them they will with pleasure yield to your requisition any Troops necessary for carrying into effect the due execution of the laws—I have sent to the commanding officer an order, a copy of which is enclosed, upon this subject-
You, whilst acting as the executive of East Florida, have a right to occupy the Government house, and the military must be supplied with quarters in the Forts or Town, or other Public buildings—It is true I resigned the Government house here to the officers, because I found it in decay, and that by yielding it to the Officers, and renting for myself, there would be a great saving to the Public.
I cannot too highly approve the propriety of your sentiments expressed on that harmony that ought to exist between the civil and military authorities, and between the military and the citizens of the country, and I trust and hope, that the same harmony which exists here between all the authorities and the citizens may exist with you, should it not, you may rely on all my power and exertions, to restore
18 Not found.
<pb#246 />
it when it does not exist, and to remove every thing which can oppose a course as desireable and honorable to military men, as it should be welcome and agreeable to the civil officer and citizen—
On the subject of Indian affairs, I have to refer you to my last letter of Sept 18** with this remark, that peace must be obtained and maintained with the Indians, and it is best always to speak the plain truth to them, they cannot and must not expect to remain scattered over the Floridas—The old Red Sticks * must return to the upper Creeks or be collected where the real natives of Florida may be collected by the Government—I learn that the Perrymans on the Appilachicola are removing up to the old nation, with their families.
M°Qween's and Franci's * clans must expect to go back to their old country, or be concentrated with the natives of Florida, already has a robbery been committed on the Appilachicola Bay by the Indians—
another such offence, you may say to them, will cause a force to be marched, and punishment inflicted—they must remain peacable, and every suspicious white man you hear of in the nation, must be apprehended and sent out of the nation.
The situation of my family will compel me to remove them to Tennessee, which will occasion my absence from this place awhile—
you will continue to communicate to me here, as I shall direct your communications to follow me—The Gov" being fully organised, no injury can arise from my short absence—whether I will have it in my power to visit St Augustine before the meeting of Congress, I cannot say—
I am Sir, with great respect Y" Mo Obt Sert.

SIR. The City Council has done me the honor of authorising me to reply to your Excellency farther Communication of 29." Ultimo *
upon the subject of its being dispossessed of the apartment hitherto occupied by it for its sessions & those of the County Court When it is notorious that the Room taken for the use of the Troops is the only one known in the whole province that has been devoted to municipal purposes, the outrage becomes more indignant as the public buildings in this City are adequate with the addition of a few Palmeto Leaves (if shingles are considered too expensive) for the lodgement of ten times the number of privates now in garrison—
The late Resolution of the Council to resign their Commissions unless they could be permitted to transact their business peaceably
<pb#248 />
must have evinced to your Excellency the feeling which such a stretch of second hand military authority was calculated to produce, but upon your assurance that the Case should be represented in its true light to the highest authorities joined to your request the Board has rescinded the resolution & will act until the matter is brought to a proper issue-
However indecorous the correspondence of Capt" Bell has been in the eyes of the Council as of every impartial Judge it is proper to remark that the Board deprecates the idea held out by him that it was actuated by the little resort of requiring in the Character of a Board of Health, that the Hospital should be removed from the Centre of the City, because the Room was forcibly taken from them the fact is that the Resolution of the latter Board was passed before the Mayor Communicated Captain Bell's summons to remove.—
It has appeared also very extraordionary to the Council as well as to every Observer of passing events that the entire occupation by a handful of Soldiers of the numerous public buildings to the entire exclusion of the Civil officers is repugnant to our republican institutions & will meet with the attention required from the proper authority—
It is painful to state, that nowithstanding the representations made by the Board thro' your Excellency to Col Eustis that a Few Troops still occupy the Room & that to this moment the Hospital is not removed or any disposition shewn to satisfy the just claims of the Citizens in that respect—
I am with much respect, Sir, Your most Obed Servn.

<pb#249 />
Eustis,” requesting him to make the report required, to you through me.—He in a very friendly and polite manner called on me and said, that he considered himself under the orders of yourself, exercising the powers of the Captain General of the Havana &" but he thought that authority could not be delegated to me, by you, as I was invested by you only with the powers of the Spanish Governor of this Province—I told him I would not at this time insist on the Point, but would hand him your original letter and he might report direct to you if he thought proper-I accordingly called on him yesterday and gave him the original letter as I thought the substance, that of having the immediate information called for by you was most to be attended to—Yet I am of opinion the most proper cource would have been to report to you through your representative here the Secretary and Acting Governor of the Province, and further, you would have his opinion which altho, in the present instance, not likely to add any thing to Col" Eustis'—Yet in other Situations it might be useful to you, in forming your judgment—some future case may occur where it would be well before hand to know if Col" Eustis or myself be correct, in your opinion—That is; are the Military stationed here under the controul, or independent of, the person appointed by you to exercise the functions of the late Spanish Governor?—

<place-time>PENSACOLA Oct. [5] 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR/ Having fully organized the Government in the Floridas, the situation of my family, and M” Jackson's great desire to get home
<pb#250 />
before the weather sets in, compel me to leave the Territory for a short time, and leave you to administer the Government of West Florida with all its appendages until my return, or until Congress shall have made regulations for the Government of the same.
I herewith enclose you a Commission * investing you with all the Civil, judicial and military powers heretofore exercised by the Governor of W. Florida under the Spanish authority, at the date of the late Treaty with Spain—referring you also, to the case decided as to Jurisdiction in the case Vidal's Heirs vs John Innerarity.”
In administering the Govt. of West Florida, you will be governed by my instructions from the President of the U. States which you will gather from my Commission as Gov' of the Floridas &" &" &", bearing date the 10" day of March, my third Commission: of date
20" March 1821. and from the instructions given by the Secretary of State to me under them, all of which you have recorded in the Book containing the Executive proceedings, and which is in your possession as Secretary of West Florida, & such other instructions as you may receive from me on this subject.
Your are well apprized of the cause that gave rise to my Proclamation * ordering certain Spanish Officers to withdraw themselves from the Territories of the Floridas, agreeably to what they were required under the 7" Article of the Treaty, by which they were bound to have withdrawn themselves within six months after the Exchange of the Ratification thereof. This order has been limited to those who have been guilty of the Contempt—should others who are not included, behave indecorously, and contemptuously to the existing authorities, you will forthwith order them from the Floridas. It must not be permitted, that foreign Officers remain here disturbing the harmony of society, alienating the quiet citizens of this Country from their allegiance to the Government, and treating that Government with contempt, which now exists in the Floridas. Should those Officers included in my Proclamation attempt to return without permission, you will forthwith confine them until they can be sent away; and should Col Callava return to this place in my absence, you will order him immediately to withdraw himself, as he was bound to do under the Treaty, but which he has failed to do—his conduct here in exciting disquietude amongst the peaceful citizens and Creoles—
the false oath he has taken, and his contemptuous conduct to the Administrators of the Government, make it necessary and proper
<pb#251 />
that if he does return, he should be forthwith ordered to depart, and should he refuse, that he be imprisoned for the contempt, until he peaceably agrees to withdraw himself, as he was bound to do under the 7* Article of the Treaty.
I have the fullest confidence, that you will administer the Government with that energy, which the peace, harmony and the protection of the Citizens and Creoles of the Country require & which is necessary to secure to the people ceded with the Country, all the rights and privileges secured to them under the late Treaty with Spain. Should it come to your knowledge that any documents or papers relating to the private property of the people in the Floridas, are about to be carried off, you will cause them to be delivered to the Office of the Alcalde for safe keeping. This being one of the important rights secured to them under the Treaty, must be carried into effect, regardless of the standing of the individual who may attempt to deprive them of this security of the right of property, guaranteed by the Treaty, and which may be attempted to be violated.
As I have directed the Secretary of East Florida, to transmit here, all his reports, you will please open, read and forward to me such as you may deem necessary and important, to such places as my memorandum directs, calculating on my speedy return to this place, on being informed of any emergency that may make my presence necessary, and all Official letters from the Heads of Departments, you will please open, read, copy, and forward me the Originals, and all private letters you will forward to Nashville unopened.”—

<dochead>GOVERNOR JACKSON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE</dochead>
<source>[NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, VIII:LS*]</source>
<place-time>PENSACOLA October 6" 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have received your letter of the 20" of August last * in answer to my several letters of the 16** 17th * & 18th of July *
<pb#252 />
which you are pleased to inform me you have transmitted to the President of the U. States at Shonnondale Springs.
You request me to communicate to you as early as possible, and as fully as may be in my power, such information as may serve to enlighten the enquiries of Congress on the different subjects which will require the attention of that body in relation to the Floridas, at their next session.
After giving this important subject the attention which it merits, and refering to the various laws which you have been pleased to notice in your letter, I proceed to lay before you such information as I have been able to collect and as I conceive to be within the scope of your enquiries, together with such reflections as suggest themselves to my mind.
As a subject of the first importance at the present juncture, I must refer you to my letter to the Secretary of War of the 17th Instant.”
You will find from that communication that the Indians are spread over the whole of East, and part of West Florida. From the talk I
have had with some of their chiefs who visited me some time ago, and forwarded with the letter just mentioned, the places at present occupied by them, has been ascertained with tolerable accuracy; that is as far as the wandering habits of these people will permit them to be considered as occupying any place. For the greater part, these Indians consist of those who fled from the Upper Creeks in 1814, and adhering to our enemies continued at war with us until subdued in 1818, since which time they have remained in the Floridas. I am clearly of opinion that they ought to be ordered up to their old places of abode within the Creek nation, as they can have no rightful claim to lands or country within the Floridas. As to those who have been born and raised within the Floridas, it is absolutely necessary that they should be collected at one point, and secured in their settlements by act of Congress, in case they cannot be prevailed upon to unite with the Creek nation, to which they originally belonged; this latter course is very desirable for their own safety, as well as dictated to us by sound policy. They might be there completely protected by our Government, they may be provided for by an annuity, or by such other mode, as Congress in its wisdom may devise, adequate to their wants, and to induce them to embrace an agricultural life. Sould the Indians prefer continuing within the Floridas it will be expedient for the safety of our frontier on the seacost, to concentrate them on the Appalachecola river immediately adjoining the Southern boundary of Georgia and Alabama, on both sides of the river and downward so as to include a sufficient area for them. By this means a sufficient white population may be interposed between them and the seaboard, and
<pb#253 />
afford a settlement strong enough to cover and protect St. Augustine and Pensacola, as well as the Peninsula of Florida.
By referring to the talk already mentioned, you will see that the difficulty of collecting the native Indians of the Floridas, to the point on the Appelachecola, will not be great. They are rejoiced to hear that a country will be allowed them to live in at all, such has been their apprehensions of their future fate since the transfer of their country to the United States, excited no doubt by mischievous advisers; and they will be still more so, to find that they will be fostered and protected by the American Government. I have been long impressed with the absurdity of entering into Treaties with the Indian tribes residing within our territorial limits, subject to our jurisdiction and to such laws as Congress may pass for their security, happiness, and safety. I therefore respectfully recommend to the consideration of the President whether it will not be proper to suggest to Congress the propriety of laying off a tract of country for them, and fixing a boundary between them and the settlement of the Whites. It is well known to me from experience and observation that more general justice can be done the Indians by the legislative provisions of Congress than by treaties: the poor can be better taken care of and more equal justice done the whole. I have constantly observed that in Indian treaties the Chiefs are fattened and the common Indian left to starve. Another and a very important reason for adopting the policy I have recommended, is the great obstacle which will otherwise exist to the surveying and bringing the public lands into market, which I presume is intended to be done as speedily as possible.
The next subject which presents itself is the form of territorial Government proper to be adopted for the Floridas This must be in a great measure adopted to the geographical form and the character of the soils. The principal body of land capable of supporting a considerable population lies nearly east and west, from the Choctahatchy to the Alatchua and St. Johns, being about thirty miles in width by about three hundred in length, and partly in East, and partly in West Florida. The Peninsula has been very little explored, but from the best information I can obtain I am inclined to think, that excepting immediately on the margin of the river St. Johns there is no extensive body of good land in any part of it, although it is possible that some good soil may be found in small quanties, in particular places. With these exceptions, the Floridas consist of Pine Woods and swamps. If the lower part of the Peninsula, were not as I believe it to be, capable of supporting only a very small population, the geographical shape of the Floridas would be extremely inconvenient. But as it is there will only be a disproportion between the length and breadth, but not such as to render it unfit for our territorial Government. Pensacola is at one of these extremes and St. Augustine at the other. The center of
<pb#254 />
the future population of the Floridas will be some where about the Suwaney, which is a fine river and flows through a country of good land. The Okafanoke swamp represented on the maps as near the heads of this river and of the Wachulla & St. Marks, has no real existance as was ascertained by me in 1818, when I marched through the country and found the swamp as represented to be the Mickasukey pond or Lake, in the midst of a very healthy fertile country, and which has been settleing very rapidly. It may be well to observe that the present maps only tend to deceive and mislead. Before Congress can enter upon the subject of a separation of the Floridas into two territories, the question of the location of the Indians must first be settled. If they be concentrated at the point proposed I would recommend that the Floridas be made but one territory, and I feel perfectly satisfied with such an arrangement, two or three years would give a sufficient population to the Floridas to form a State Government. Should a separation take place this object will be long deferred if not entirely defeated, and may produce the necessity of uniting West Florida to Alabama, which if done will of course occasion the annexation of East Florida to Georgia. The whole, if no subdivision takes place, will in a few years constitute one of the most respectable States in this part of the Union, will exceed Louisiana in population and rival it in wealth, but if seperated into two territories the population of neither will suffice.
As far as I have been able to ascertain the wishes of the people of West Florida, they appear to be against the annexation to Alabama, and from what I can learn, the same sentiment prevails in East Florida with respect to Georgia. The best interests of the Floridas in my opinion require that they should be united under one territorial Government, with an eye to a speedy admission into the union as a state, by this means a great saving will be made to the U. States in maintaining two distinct territorial Governments for an uncertain period of time. The vicinity of the Suwany river possesses many advantages for the location of the seat of Government: it is equally central to the country East of the St. Johns—the Escambia and Florida point; over and above the advantages of being situated in the center of a beautiful lime stone country.
I am of opinion, taking into view the mixed population likely to exist here for some time, that the form of the territorial Government ought to be simple and energetic. The territorial organization, in the first grade of Government, adopted for the Louisiana territory, with some alterations to suit local circumstances, may answer the purpose. The Spanish population forming but a small proportion, it is of very little importance to preserve any of their ancient laws and customs; the sooner they become American the better.
<pb#255 />
The lands and the land titles of the Floridas require the most serious attention of Congress. It is a subject of the greatest importance to the Government and ought to receive the earliest consideration.
Whilst the honest grantee may be protected in his rights, the greatest pains should be taken to exclude the numerous fraudulent and antidated claims, founded on no possession, at the time of issuing the grant or concession, and without any original record or survey in West Florida that has yet been discovered. Nearly all these grants commence in 1817, by petition to the Governor for an order of survey or location, and in every instance the other parts of the title are completed from 1818 to 1821. For some years past, from all I can learn this has been a trading business with the Officers of the Spanish Government both here and at St. Augustine. The stranger was accosted in the streets and offered a grant for a Doubloon or some trifle.
The petition only has the appearance of being original, but in most instances in all probability antedated, the other documents attached to it, are only certified copies from the archives in the keeping of Pintado the Surveyor General at Havanna, and who is even now making out official certificates of those papers to be evidence here, a kind of impudence and imposture at which congress will no doubt be indignant. Before the year 1817 there was scarcely any such thing as a grant of land excepting in the immediate vicinity of this place, and I presume that in East Florida, the number was also very inconsiderable. They were made I believe, merely with a view to the change of governments, and with no intention of settling. A
provision similar to that contained in the 14" Sect of the act of the
20" December 1803, * declaring all incomplete grants not commenced before 1816, and not accompanied by settlement as null and void, would at once put an end to the whole of the fraudulent grants. As to the enormous grants in different parts of the Floridas it is not necessary for me to speak, but I am pretty certain that if all are sanctioned it will take a country twice as large as the Floridas to gratify them. The extract of a letter from M Brown a gentleman of respectability from Baltimore herewith enclosed, " will shew that a grant has been made since the 24* January 1818, by the Captain General of Cuba to Arredondo for a large tract in the Alachua plains, and which I have evry reason to believe is fraudulent. I would therefore recommend that Congress should declare void all grants for land, not founded on actual possession before the 22" February 1816, * Jackson was in error. There was no Congressional act of any description enacted on the date mentioned. Undoubtedly the allusion was to an act approved Mar. 26, 1804 (Terr. Papers, Orleans, Ix, 202–213; 2 STAT. 283–289), the fourteenth article of which provided for a time limit for the reception of claims based on Spanish titles.
<pb#256 />
and in like manner declaring void all grants not bottomed on a concession regularly made agreeably to the Spanish law, and possession taken and continued, and improvements made thereon in strict conformity to the Spanish regulations making such exceptions as will secure his settlement &c, to the individual who shall have had five years continued possession, prior to the 24" day of January 1818. In referring to the numerous acts of Congress for the adjustment of the land titles in the different territories, I find very little that is applicable at present to the Floridas, excepting the act of the 21" April
1806,” the first section of which defines that no grant shall be valid, unless founded on possession, commencing with and continued under the concession by the proper officer of Spain. The greatest difficulty appears to be in the establishment of a board of Commissioners. A
great variety of plans have been fallen upon. The first consisting of three Commissioners, Secretary, Register, recorder, was found too expensive and dilatory, the last adopted for the Country East of the Mississippi was too simple and too cheap; two districts were formed and a single Commissioner appointed to each with a Clerk who was expected to discharge all the functions of recorder and translator.”
This may have answered a very good purpose in Mississippi and Alabama, but much more difficult and important legal questions will arise here; and I do not hesitate to say that the Commissioners for the settlement of the land titles ought to be men of the first legal talents, of strict integrity, and I would add as an essential requisite, possessing no landed interest in the Floridas. Persons will be recommended from this place who ought not to be appointed. There are but few titles which are clear of dispute, and when a man has bought a title under disputed circumstances, it is very natural that self interest, and the interest of his friends, will have great weight in his mind, and precedents will be established to ensure their validity. I do not go too far when I say that no person should be appointed who has bought a land claim in the Floridas. It cannot be too strongly impressed on the mind of the President, that men of talents and strict integrity, who have no interest in landed property in the Floridas, should be selected as commissioners to settle the land titles.
It is of great importance that the Judiciary should be filled by men of first rate legal talents and unimpeached integrity, as much will depend upon those who are employed to lay the foundation of any system. Respectability will be given to the government by appointing men possessing weight of character, they ought to be well acquainted with the civil law, and the maritime law, as well as the common law.
412 STAT. 391-395.
<pb#257 />
The same court might have chancery powers given to it, on the plan of the circuit courts of the U. States, and I think ought to be required to hold its terms more frequently, than has been usual, or to hold adjourned courts from time to time as business may require. I consider the Judiciary as by far the most important branch of the territorial Government; persons should be selected whose unexceptionable character will be a pledge that they will stear clear of the influence of corruption of any kind or partiality. To the high character of the distributers of justice from the bench, will be attached that confidence, indespensable in all well regulated governments. It is the purity of this branch of the administration, which secures to the citizen, the peaceful enjoyment of his constitutional rights and privileges, and awards a speedy punishment to those who violate the law and trample upon the rights of others.
I forward you printed copies of the ordinances * as they may perhaps contain something, deserving of being permanently incorporated in the act of Congress organizing the territorial government."

<docbody>SIR Your letter of the 9" of August" by M. Bird reached me on the 29" of the same month—But as my letters of the 21** and 28**
of August would shew you that I had fortunately anticipated your views, I did not think it necessary to trouble you with a repetition of what I had already written-
I have now the honor to acknowledge your interesting favour of the
1* ult.* which came to hand on the 2" inst.—As far as we have progressed in the subject of the Archives I enclose you copies of letters and papers relative to it marked N° 1. 2. 3. 4.5 & 6 & 7.*—You will
<pb#259 />
see that the subject early drew my attention—And before the Floridian of the 25th August arrived here, which was not 'till the
25th of September, I had determined to wait no longer for instructions from Washington and Havana on this affair, but take possession of them peacably if practicable, but forcibly if necessary—A short time after this determination which I had communicated to the Marshall, Col" Forbes, he brought in the paper containg the proceedings in the arrest of Col" Callava—I then saw you would justify me—but no formal complaints had been made me—And I knew that the subject had been laid before you and I expected by every mail to receive orders on it—I also kept a look out that if there had been a disposition to send the Archives secretly away, it would not have succeeded—I
also lulled them, even after seeing what had been done at Pensacola not only into security, but expected to take them, unawares and in the execution of faithless and fictitious proceedings On the first inst. I intended to make the seizure. if original papers as I expected, were refused being brought into the Court of the County of S. Johns but on the motion being made, the originals were brought in—I determined then without any formal complaint to make the seizure on the 2" and engaged Col" Forbes at 11 to wait on Col."
Eustis with me—At 10 on that morning yours of the first ulto.” ordering the seizure arrived—I consulted with Col" Eustis, and gave the Commission to the persons appointed—who executed the order as you will see by their report—I then issued the enclosed order to the three secretaries and they are now employed in investigating the papers—which when completed I will have the pleasure of further Reporting to you-
I trust you know I should not so egregiously have mistaken your Proclamation, yet its having been mistaken, put me in the disagreeable predicament of correcting it by annihilating the Spanish Government here—which the Spaniards looked for as a matter of cource when you were placed at the head of the Floridian Administration and they would not have grumbled at it then—but being continued unexpectedly in power, and then forced to commit suicide by me, rendered me no favourite with them—But I was certain the cource I
pursued was what you intended—and recollecting what the President said to me at Washington respecting the Spaniards I was certain it would be approved of there—
Your remarks respecting the Spanish Constitution and powers of the District Judge &" I have noted and shall ponder over with much deliberation—I dont know that any thing will occur to call your ideas into operation, if it should I shall with great pleasure recur to your opinion-
<pb#260 />
Col" Coppinger the Spanish Ex Governor I have always since my arrival here considered as a private individual—under the 7* Article of the Treaty—I wrote him so—we have had a little sparring—He wished me to arrest and confine a Spaniard in the Fort—I declined it in a pointed maner—And I informed his friend, if there was such a thing as a Spy in time of Peace—it was the only offence that I knew of, for which I would order any one of his Catholic Majesty's subjects into such a place—
On the subject of Captain Willis I have already written you—If I
can do any thing for him, you may command me—Judge Duval has not yet arrived, if he can get here in time I will aid him for the Clerkship of his Court-
I enclose you poor Penier's Obituary *—Seldom has any thing struck upon my heart so painfully as this event—He was at my house on tuesday night, gay, interesting and delightful. Alas on thursday night he breathed his last—
This vile Black vomit plays sad work amongst us—My Chief Judge"—Our Indian Agent—and about half a dozen others of my friends already sleep in a watery grave about two feet and a half below the Surface of this Peninsula—
I have lost but one person out of my own family as yet—I enclose a copy of my Proclamation on this subject *—I promulged it with the powers you say I possess in yours of the 1* ulto. and as you did me the honor to say I possess them, I determined not to diminish myself as your officer—So to prevent exaggeration—as bad accounts might depreciate the United States purchace of the Floridas—yet I
thought it best not to conceal the truth—I have a parcel of loose papers left by Mr. Peniers * If the Government at Washington should not appoint an Indian Agent, I presume as the Governor of
<pb#261 />
East Florida, I am ex officio the Indian Agent, I had before the death of M* Peniers written to the Secretary at War in favour of Captain Bell 90–
The County Court of St Johns and your whole system goes on very well—The unpleasant missunderstanding about the Public Buildings and property here, which we thought might cease on the arrival of Col" Eustis, still continues—My letter of 28* August is full on that subject & I wait to know, if, with the exception of the Fort, all the other property should not be under the controul and disposition of the Civil Authority—some disagreeable correspondence has taken place on this subject which I shall have the pleasure of enclosing you in my next—
Altho I have the mark of such high confidence as to be at the head of this Provincial Government—yet I have no contingent funds to enable me to make any, the most necessary disbursements for the Public service—I am obliged to have a private secretary and a public Office, also should have a House at the charge of the Government to live in, & have to incur other incidental expenses as the military before I reached this, had appropriated all the Public Buildings to their own use and occupation—
If some facilities of these kinds are not allowed me, I shall have sacrifised not only my health and time to this important and interesting duty, but shall beggar my wife and Children, by spending my little private property—This is a painful subject and I feel confident I need only appeal to your Liberality and Justice to insure me a speedy and competent renumeration-
I am sorry to hear your health is bad—I have no great opinion of this climate compared with Tennessee or Maryland—Every thing the Spaniards ever had, has been Shamefully exagerated—But I
trust, you will recruit and force this section of the Union into repute and consequence—If I had money I could do something, but as things are my great policy is to do no more than I can possibly avoid With very great respect &c W. G. D. WORTHINGTON

<docbody>DEAR SIR I hope that you have long since fully recovered your health, of which, your last letter gave very satisfactory proof, as it appeard that you were then not only able to take daily exercise, but actually took it, by a ride to Bladensburg. M. Gouverneur" who left us yesterday with our daughter for New York, will inform you, of our state, which is favorable.
The discussions in Florida, will require some direction, or at least notice, from the Executive, & on the questions, of law, growing out of the conduct of the parties, an opinion from you.” Presuming this to be the case, it will be useful for you to have the whole subject before you, that you may, when called on, be ready to act. The enclosed papers contain, I believe, all that has passed between them.”
Return them to me, after giving them a thorough examination.
According to my recollection, of our construction of the law, when we had it under consideration, and took the measures which placed the parties in their present stations, as to use a military phrase, on the present battle-ground, it was considerd, that the Spanish laws, civil, judicial, & military, heretofore exercised by the officers of Spain, should remain in force, & be exercised, by the Governor & those acting under him in regard to the internal governm" of the provinces in such manner, as the Executive should direct, untill a temporary gov", should be regularly organized over those territories: that the laws relating to revenue & the slave trade, were those only, of the U States, which even for the present, extended to those territories, and for the execution of which, a district judge, was appointed, at Pensacola, &
another at S*Augustine. If this view is correct, it follows, that the district judges have nothing to do, with the internal gov" of the provinces, or with any concern, other than, simply, the revenue & slave trade. Under the laws of Spain, I believe, there is no such writ, as that of H. Corpus, so that, if the power of a D. Judge, was not limited, as above stated, M. Fromentin would have had no right to grant it.
The inquisition & military despotism, are completely at variance, with the principles, on which that writ is founded. On no view therefore that I have yet taken of the subject, had he any right, to interfere.
That the Gov’ may have displayed some degree of zeal & warmth, & have executed the Spanish powers, too much in the Spanish way, makeing no nice distinction, according to the principles of our system, between the appropriate duties of the several departments of the gov", * Samuel L. Gouverneur, the President's secretary and son-in-law.
<pb#263 />
Executive, Judiciary, &cc, considering them all blended in himself, & taken that character, which best suited the occasion, of Judge, for example, to call Col: Calava before him, & make him disgorge the papers, which he unjustly withheld, & of combining all together, in overruling the H. corpus, & summoning the D. J." before him, is in accord in point of energy, with what we have known of him in other occurrences. But it is for us to enquire, whether the law justifies, what he did, & whether the power thus exercised, was exerted, in a good cause, & produced good If there was no right, in the judge to issue the writ, the expression of that sentiment by the Executive, settles that question, which is all that is depending, between the Gov" and the judge.
Whether it will be proper to with hold the nomination of Mr Fr: *
is another question. This new bar, is divided on that point. They constitute themselves [by the bye]" a bar, before there is any court, and remonstrate, against the appointment of a judge, who alone, could form a court. Still they are men of character, whose [MS. illegible]
ought to be weighed. This will, all, be considerd in due time.
with very sincere regard I am dear sir yours.
- JAMES MONROE
For the gov" of other territories, three judges, have, I think, generally been appointed. In this, it was thought proper to appoint none, according to my recollection, for that purpose, leaving the internal organization to the Gov' & appoint a district judge, only, at each place. I mention this as a reason, which probably inducd the gov", to exercise judicial powers, not thinking himself at liberty to incur the expence of a judge, or several of his own appointment for a service so temporary."

Bell is desirous of obtaining an appointment as Agent for Indian affairs in this province. I have long been acquainted with his merits as an officer, & know no one, who more eminently deserves the favour of the Government, & I believe him to possess special qualifications for this particular duty.—The death of M. Penieres, Sub-Agent, has doubtless been communicated to you.
Previous to my arrival here, some issues of Rations—Tobacco, Powder & Lead have been made to the Indians under the authority of Capt. Bell. I presume therefore they may expect a continuance of them. No application has yet been made to me for such supplies. If any should be made, I shall grant them with the most rigid Oeconomy, until I am informed, whether or not they are authorised by the Government.

Horatio S. Dexter and Edward M. Wanton to Abraham Eustis Copy S' AUGUSTINE, October 5* 1821.
Col EUSTIS, Comm" at S*Augustine, SIR, Since our arrival in town, we have not ascertained in whom is vested the charge of Indian affairs for the United States but under the impression that this is a subject embraced within your duties we take the liberty of addressing ourselves directly to you. The late treaty between Spain and the United States found the Seminole Indians disposed to forget former causes of enmity to the United States a change of feeling which we had greatly contributed to produce. This favourable disposition we laboured to improve so successfully that nothing is now more desired by them than an understanding with the United States. To the greatest distrust has succeeded no small confidence in the justice and generosity of the United States. Capt.
Bell with whom we have constantly communicated, * has probably
<pb#265 />
informed you of the means taken to tranquilize their fears and their wishes to enter as speedily as possible into an arrangement finally settling their future relations with the United States, And our principal object is to state that the Chiefs have vested in us the power to make for them a Treaty, this duty we will discharge alone or in concert. If you are prepared to take advantage of a disposition now eminently favourable to this object we are ready to enter immediately on the business, if not we respectfully suggest that the appointment of an agent without delay is of the utmost consequence and if it be consistent with the views of the President we would recommend Capt.
Bell who has acquired the confidence of the indians an object of no small consideration in treating with a race of men so diffident of their own skill in diplomacy and so little used to civilized modes of conducting national affairs.—In forming a decision on this subject it ought not to be forgotten that the present is the moment and this the mode of securing to the United States upon principles just both to themselves and others of very important interests having but little apparent connexion with the Indians.

<place-time>S* AUGUSTINE Oct” 8* 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR GENERAL, It has been my misfortune to incur the displeasure of Mr Worthington Secretary of this Province; Mr Forbes Marshall of this Province and Mayor of this city, and M Rodman Collector of the Port and District of S*Augustine Councellor and Attorney at law.—
The amount of my offence, (I have every reason to believe) is that I
did not allow either of those gentlemen to take possession of the public property or edifices on their arrival here or since—M Worthington politely required the Government House, which was occupied by military officers there being no other public quarters for them-
Mr Forbes took a stand in behalf of the City Corporation, authorised the erection of buildings on the public grounds which I forbid, and the holding possession of the “National School” which I allowed them to occupy for a time—M Rodman required the house adjoining the Custom House which had been occupied by the late Treasurer under Cong., 1 sess., p. 41); it was reported on by the Committee on Indian Affairs on Jan. 19, 1830, when the House resolved that the petitioner have leave to withdraw his petition and documents (ibid., p. 183).
<pb#266 />
the Spanish Government—and was on his arrival occupied by myself and which I held, until the arrival of Col Eustis, for his family—
After the arrival of Col. Eustis and before he assumed the command, the repeated representations of the Army Surgeon against our occupying the fort and the increased numbers on the Sick report induced me to remove the Troops in town, one company to occupy the “School House” which was then. (by my permission) occupied by the City Council, the other company to occupy the “Flour Store”—I did not take possession of the School House, until I had first made formal application to Forbes the Mayor, who submitted the letter to his Concil, who addressed a letter to M' Worthington threatning to resign their commissions if the building was to be occupied by the Troops at the same time passed a resolution ordering our hospital to be removed out of town; which letter and resolution M* Worthington enclosed to Col. Eustis, with not only a compliance with the council in their views, but a threat of reporting the circumstances to the President of the United States—Col Eustis not being in command delivered the letters to me, to which I replied, in a manner calculated to convince the gentlemen that I was not to be intimidated by threats;
after which, I ordered the Troops to occupy the School house and turn the Council furniture out of door—The consequence has been an arrest at the suit of a M. Fairbanks who I confined on the twenty first of July, for four days, as a principal in a Second degree, in an attempt to carry off by force on the night of the 20" July a negro woman and her two children then in the possession of the law—Rodman is attorney and damages laid at 450 dollars—This appears to be the only hold they can get of me, I shall plead the want of jurisdiction in the Court under the impression that I am accountable to you and the Gov' of the United States and not to the Hon” Court of the County of S*
Johns, for an act committed while acting, under the Same authority rom which the Court Since derived its being—Rodman has not forgoten the tea whieh was thrown in his face and consequently dislikes all persons wearing the cloth of a Soldier."
70 The President's views on this subject were communicated to the Secretary of War, Oct. 11, 1821 (NA, WD, SW Lets. Recd., P84) as follows:
“I have made a note as to the public buildings at St Augustine, which you will execute in the best manner you can. Perhaps it may not be necessary, to have any formal communication with either Mr Adams or Mr Crawford on the subject.
The military ought to yield every accomodation in their power, to the civil officiers, and I should suppose, with suitable exertions, that they might put their barracks in a state to keep them warm, by chimneys, in the winter, and admit as much air by windows as would prevent contagion. The want of cleanliness among the Spaniards, was the cause of disease with them. That will not exist with us.
Any necessary expenditure, on a small scale, might be paid out of some contingent or other fund, as I presume, that none should be incurrd in any line to be avoided, for there will I fear be a considerable deficiency in the revenue.”
<pb#267 />
I take the liberty to enclose a charge made out against the United States for extra Services &" during the time I was doing the duty of Provisional Secretary of East Florida—under the impression that Something should be allowed me to cover the necessary expences to which I was Subject—If the charge is such as meets your approbation I hope by your assistance, it will be allowed and paid–It can hardly be expected by the Government of the United States, that a Secretarys living and contingent expences can be paid gratis out of a captains allowance."—
Most respectfully, I am, Sir Your most obed" Serv't JN" R. BELL Cap' 4" Arty P. S. M. Worthingtons proclamation is premature, for I do assure you, that but two Soldiers have died in hospital Since we have occupied this Station.

<docbody>SIR I enclose you an account of my proceedings in the case of the Archives and Documents * which I have seized here—The Seperation of the papers is not yet completed-I must confess I regarded the Spanish Officers remaining here more as a matter of Speculative intrigue and espionage, than anything else—Since this last blow the Ex-
Governor, whom I look upon as no better than the general run of Spanish Provincial Governors has taken his departure and I suppose many discontented Spaniards will follow his example—He and myself had a little dispute about a man of the name of Ugarte,” the particulars of which I will send on, lest the affair should be misrepresented, for I am conscious of being correct in the procedure. I enclose you certain papers respecting a disagreeable dispute between the Civil and Military, here respecting the public property"—I think all the
<pb#268 />
public property, with the exception of the Fort should be placed under the controul and disposal of the Civil Power— I am determined not to disgrace our country by quarrelling with our own Citizens, whether Civil or Military—And we confidently look up to you, for redress, from a system thought by some in this particular, as exclusively vexatious, as if it emenated from a Corps of Janissaries—I have not heard from General Jackson on this subject as yet-It takes about
30 days hence to Pensacola and 30 back again, so tedious is the mail route.-
I found myself bound in honour and humanity to issue a Proclamation respecting the health of this place—Our fine, hardy, healthy Northerners, have been swept off most woefully by the Black vomit—
Now, whoever comes hereafter to this place, will act knowingly and provide against the worst—If I had not had said something official, I am certain the sickness would have been exaggerated, which would have injured the value of the purchace of the Floridas—Now, the present sickness will be attributed to unusual and extraordinary causes, which may not exist again—I adopted my title from those words in a letter of General Jackson of the 1* Sept**—he says “There is no doubt that the person exercising the powers of the Governor of East Florida can exercise all the powers, exercised under the King of Spain at the time the Country was ceded”—However I exercise as little of the character of a Spanish Governor as I can possibly avoid—Indeed I act no further than I deem absolutely necessary, in the present state of things—there is such a heterogenious mass here, that it would be a folly to expect steering clear of contests with all—I have had no collision as yet with any but the Spaniards and Military—the former is at an end since the taking of the Archives—The latter will be put to rest by marking out our proper limits.—

<place-time>WASHINGTON. October 11. 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>MY DEAR SIR. I have read with great attention the papers you sent me on Sunday,” touching the controversy between Gov. Jackson
& Judge Fromentin, and according to your instruction, now return them. You will find with them a number of The Enquirer, in which there is a report of the case extracted from The Floridian, as tried before the Governor, on a plea to his jurisdiction. I do not think that in this report the case is placed on it's true ground. The objection of the new constitution of the Cortes is repelled, by the decision, on the ground that after the original signing of the treaty, or at least after it's ratification by the King of Spain, the provinces are to be considered as territories of the U.S. which could not be affected by any political revolution ef in Spain, or any extension of the principles of that revolution to her colonies. Admit this to be true, and that Spain could not, after those periods; legislate for the Floridas, the Congress of the U. S. could: and congress did legislate for them by the act of the 3" March 1821,” “to carry into effect the treaty between the U.S. and Spain,” by the 2" section of which it is enacted “that until &" &" all the military, civil and judicial powers exercised by the officers of the existing government of the same territories, shall be vested in such person and persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the President of the U.S. shall direct, for the maintaining the inhabitants of s” territories in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion; and the laws of the U.S. relating to the revenue
<pb#271 />
and it's collection (subject to the modification of the 15" article of the treaty) and the laws relating to the importation of persons of colour, shall be extended to the said territories.” The government then which congress adopted for the Floridas, is the spanish form of government as it existed in actual operation on the 3 March 1821.
The policy of the provision was, manifestly, to render the disrupture of those provinces, from the Spanish authority, as little violent, painful and inconvenient to the inhabitants as possible, by causing the government, as it stood, to slide, as it were, off the shoulders of the Spanish officers on those of our officers. So that the reason as well as the letter of the act of Congress point to that form of Spanish government which was in actual operation on the 3 march 1821, as the government intended to be adopted and continued. If then Judge Fromentin is correct in the assertion that the people of Florida had sworne to the constitution of the Cortes 16 months before he wrote, still unless the new constitution was that which the Spanish officers were actually administering at the date of our act, it is not the government adopted by congress. Now we learn from the statement of facts detailed in the opinion of the court in this report that it is questionable whether the constitution of the Cortes had even been proclaimed in the Floridas at the date of our act. I understand it as unquestionable that this new constitution of government had not been actually organized at this date. The powers then, as distributed by it, were not those powers military, civil and judicial “exercised by the officers of the existing government” were het the pewers which congress directed to be transferred to officers appointed under the authority of the President: and hence the constitution of the Cortes had nothing to do with the question of Governor Jackson's judicial powers. These were to be decided solely by the character and extent of the powers actually exercised by the Spanish Governor of Florida on the 3 March 1821. I understand it to be conceded, that the Spanish Governor did, at that time, possess and exercise the judicial powers claimed and exercised by Governor Jackson in the case of Vidal; and hence I think it very clear that Governor Jackson, whose commission put him precisely in the shoes of the Spanish Governor, rightfully claimed and exercised those powers.
With regard to Judge Fromentin his appointment and commission would have been unnecessary and improper if congress had stopped at the adoption of the Spanish system: because such a judge would have been an anomaly in that system and could have found no functions apposite to his commission. But congress having added to the Spanish System, our revenue and Slave laws, the appointment of a judge became indispensible for the performance of the judicial functions expressly designated and required by those laws. The purpose of his
<pb#272 />
appointment marks out the extent of his powers; they are limited to the enforcement of the revenue & slave laws; and he cannot go beyond these limits without invading the province of those who, under the authority of congress, were administering the Spanish system which as to Judge Fromentin was a foreign system and as to him as completely extra: territorial as the system then administered in Cuba or old Spain.
Judge Fromentin defends his authority to issue a writ of habias corpus, in this case, under the 14" section of the Judiciary act of
1789.” This section enacts “that all the before mentioned courts of the U.S. shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions and agreable to the principles and usages of law.” So far, the section has been construed by the Supreme court as confining the power to issue these writs to cases in which they may be necessary for the exercise of some branch of the jurisdiction given by other sections of this law to the federal courts; not as an original, seperate and independent authority to issue these writs; but to issue them only in cases in which they may be necessary as the auxiliaries to give effect to some other branch of their jurisdiction. Judge Fromentin for example had a jurisdiction limited to two subjects: the revenue & slave laws: if in any trial before Judge Fromentin's court, the testimony of either of the persons committed by Gov" Jackson had been necessary, Judge Fromentin would have had a right to issue a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, because such writ would have been necessary for the exercise of his jurisdiction: but in the case which has occurred, it is not alledged and indeed cannot be, that any such necessity existed for the writ. The section, however, goes on to provide—“that either of the Judges of the Supreme Court as well as judges of the District courts shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of the commitment. Provided that writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol, unless where they are in custody under or by color of the authority of the U.S. or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.”—Now if Congress had declared the laws of the U. S. generally, or this act, specially, to be in force in Florida, at the same time that they declared the Spanish System in force, (if such a chaos may be supposed for argument's sake)
Judge Fromentin, on the naked representation that these persons were illegally confined under colour of the authority of the U. S. (the representation being made according to legal usage) would have had the power to issue his writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of the commitment; but as soon as upon this enquiry
<pb#273 />
he had ascertained that they had been committed for a contempt by the seperate and at least co-ordinate tribunal which was administering the Spanish system of laws, he could not have taken another step in that direction but would have been constrained to quash his writ &
remand the prisoners. If instead of ascertaining this state of things, on the return of the habeas corpus, it had been made known to him in the first instance and had been relied on as the ground of application for the writ, he would not have been authorised to issue it: for this writ is never issued upon a statement which if true would not authorise a discharge. Now this as I take it is the case which really occurred.
Judge Fromentin was informed that another, a seperate & independent tribunal over which he had no control and with which he had no more connexion than he had with the courts of Cuba or of Spain, had committed these persons for a contempt of it's authority;
Suppose on the return of the habeas corpus these facts had appeared to be true, could he have discharged these persons? He certainly could not unless he possessed a Supervising and controlling power over the acts of the other tribunal which can scarcely be pretended;
and since he could not discharge, the habeas corpus ought not to have been awarded. This, even if this general authority as to habeas corpus had been extended to Florida: as it was not, the writ was wholly improper.
Judge Fromentin proceeded I have no doubt very honestly but on a mistake both of Governor Jackson's powers & his own: he thought that Judge Gov. Jackson had no judicial power, and that he had all the judicial power which is conferred by the constitution and laws of the U. S. on a district judge. This mistake proceeded from not attending accurately to the provisions of the act of Congress of 3
March 21. He did not advert to the fact that by the force of this law and your commission under it Gov. Jackson had succeeded to all the powers military, civil & judicial of the Spanish Gov';—nor to the fact that he, as a Judge of the U. S. possessed the power only to execute such laws of the U. S. as had been extended by congress to these U. S. territories: that he was, consequently, a judge only to the purpose of executing the revenue & slave laws, possessing all the judicial powers necessary to the enforcement of these laws; but no more: & that consequently he had no right to interfere with Gov. J.'s discharge of the seperate mass of judicial powers, which belonged to him, and for the exercise of which he was responsible to the President, not to Judge Fromentin.
This is my view of the case which I believe co: incides essentially with your own. I have thrown it out for your consideration of the ground on which I rest it, not meaning to offer it as an official opinion, nor meaning this as an official letter.
<pb#274 />
With respect to Judge Fromentin, I have seen no evidence of his unfitness, which ought to induce you to with. hold his nomination from the Senate. The objection to his morals is mere report and may be slander: and I do not think this mistake with regard to the habeas corpus such a proof of incapacity as to justify your with. holding his nomination from the Senate. Judging from the papers it will be very strenously contended by a large body of editors and citizens, perhaps judges & lawyers that it was no mistake; and even if it shall be admitted to be a mistake, it will still be a very popular one. It was an error on the side of liberty; and it evinces no ordinary share of judicial courage to have followed the direction of his conscience when it brought him directly and inevitably into collision with a man of Gov. Jackson's energy. It will have an air of rather undignified fickleness to have commissioned a man as judge, whom you will not even nominate to the senate, on no better reason for the change of opinion than a tale of scandal, unsupported by proof, the remonstrance of a parcel of strangers, calling themselves the bar, whose opportunities of personal knowledge with regard to Judge Fromentin are wholly unknown and with regard to whom he says that they are utter strangers to him except one (M. Breckenridge) who accuse him in general terms of immorality & incapacity, with" specifying the testimony on which they rest their charges or the sources from which they derive their information; or the complaints of a Gov' of Gen.'
Jackson's temperament, whose irascibility is in a blaze at the slightest and most conscientious resistance to his authority. I am much surprized that Fromentin so circumstanced, with the Gov. & bar sh"
wish to hold the office; but I am by no means satisfied that a commission bestowed on full consideration, can with dignity or propriety be re.called by a President of the U. S. for no better reasons than these. There can be no doubt that there would be printers enough who would be proud of the opportunity to repeat their cry of the fear of Jackson, against the administration, and to exhibit Fromentin as a victim sacraficed, through this fear, to the fiery Moloch; and tho'
I never would be deterred from taking a right step by the dread of such a construction of my motives, yet I think the real grounds ought at least to be so strong and prominent before the public as to rescue the step, with all candid men, from such injurious misconstruction;
and I doubt whether this would be the case with regard to with.
holding the nomination of Judge Fromentin.
Besides; is it perfectly clear that you can revoke a commission which has been accepted and acted on? The Arkansaw Judge,” at the last session, had never entered on the duties of his commission;
but, on the contrary, had continued to discharge the duties of a
<pb#275 />
previous commission, in the state of his residence, long after accepting his commission for Arkansaw; these acts on his part were justly considered as a virtual resignation of this latter commission and you nominated another gentleman. But Judge Fromentin has not only accepted his commission, but gone to his appointment, organized his court & entered on the discharge of his duties: The constitution declares that commissions thus conferred shall eehtinue expire at the end of the next session of the Senate. Is it the meaning of this clause that commissions thus conferred shall abide the pleasure of the Senate only, or, was it intended to reserve to the President the opportunity of making another choice? I am not informed of the practise; but, abstractedly considered; I should regard a commission conferred by the President in the recess of the Senate as amounting, in general, to a promise that if the appointee sh" continue as deserving, as he was at the time of his appointment, he would be nominated to the Senate. I say in general: because where the President had made an appointment under a gross deception, either as to the capacity or integrity of the appointee, the paramount duty which he owes to the public would absolve him from this implied promise to the appointee;
and I sh" consider him bound by his oath of office to name another person. But the case, I think, should be a strong one which sh" call for this course; something better than scandalous mista tales of gallantry, personal dislikes either of Gov' or bar, or such a mistake of law as that which Judge Fromentin has committed. This is the view which I have at present, of this part of the case.
Gov. Jacksons proceedings with regard to the ex:governor Callava, and Judge Fromentin may have been according to his Spanish authority of which I cannot pretend to judge. It may have been, as you say, merely an exercise of Spanish power too, much in the Spanish way.
Our friend the General certainly takes to this same Spanish power as kindly as if it was natural to him: but you may rely upon it, it will require all his popularity to gild this pill.
With regard to Callava (from what I suppose of Gov. Jackson's Spanish power), if he, Callava, had been merely a private individual of Spain who was about to elope with papers which, by the treaty, belonged to the Province, I should readily believe Gov. Jackson altogether right. But was Callava merely a private individual? Was he not the commissioner charged by Spain with the fulfilment of the treaty on her part; was it not in this character that he was in possession of the papers contained in those boxes which really belonged to the King of Spain:—As the Commissioner of Spain was he not entitled to the courtesy & respect due to the sovereign whom he represented:
and if in transferring the archives & documents, he retained any which the commissioner of the other nation thought he ought to have delivered, was the question to be settled by force? Was it according
<pb#276 />
to the comity of nations in such a case that the commissioner of one nation should lay violent hands on the other, and compel him to yield to his sense of his duty? That Callava did wrong, that he acted basely, if not corruptly, I have very little doubt: but still this act was done in the sacred character of of the representative of the King of Spain: it was an unfaithful execution of the treaty on the part of Spain, for which the nation was liable; it was a just ground of remonstrance to Spain: we had a right to call for these papers from her, and to exact them at as great a hazard as we chose to encounter for them:
but to offer violence to the person of her representative, to seize &
imprison him; and to break open the boxes containing the papers which belonged to the King his master, is, I apprehend, an act which we shall find it difficult to justify to the civilized nations of the earth.
I am, it is true, not very conversant with questions of this sort;—but had the tables been turned on us, well I know that we should have made the welkin ring: as Shakespeare says, it would have been with as but a word & a blow and the blow would probably have come first.
Now ‘do unto others as you would they should do unto you' is just as sound a rule of action between nations as individuals. What would have satisfied us?—The answer to this question may afford some light as to what it is our duty to do.
The proceeding against Judge Fromentin is equally indefensible.
It was enough for Gov. Jackson to have refused obedience to the writ of Habeas Corpus. Fromentin had no power to enforce it. He could not practically have thwarted the Governor's course. And after refusing obedience to the writ, both the Governor and the Judge ought to have referred the question to you, & have, decorously, have abided your decision. But for the Governor of a Territory, to summon a judge of the U.S. to his tribunal to answer for the discharge of a conscientious duty, will not be tolerated by the people of this country.
I verily beleive Jackson to be an honest man & a man of strong natural sense—and a patriotic man too—as jealous of his country's honor as any other man living, but he knows no law except the law of force; and his want of information, combined with his violence, is perpetually plunging him & his friends into difficulties, from which it is not easy to escape without some loss of lustre. On the present occasion, if even his great popularity saves him from general execration, it will be because one of the sufferers is a Spanish tool & the other a French priest. M. Calhoun * & myself think that it will be
<pb#277 />
advisable for you to come down and give this subject the direction you wish before the people, while yet the public opinion is green enough to take any bent you please. It is manifest from the public prints that the question as to the habeas corpus is not understood:
but it is equally manifest from them that a storm is brewing both for Jackson & the administration unless some step shall be promptly taken to avert it.
I beg you to excuse this long and rambling letter; which I have written rather for your consideration than as expression of the opinion to which I may, myself, be carried on a joint consultation. I thought it desirable that your own attention and judgment should be called to these views, and it is for this reason that I have thought it my duty to make them.
I am myself perfectly persuaded that Governor Jackson's intentions have been perfeetly correct throughout the whole of this affair. His judgment too has been essentially right; for both Callava & Fromentin had done wrong; and the Governor's error, I think, consists in his having taken their punishment into his own hands. Even this error may find an apology in the undefined and unknown powers with which the act of Congress authorized him to be invested. There were, as I
understand, no books to inform him of the extent and limits of the powers exercised by the Spanish Governor of the Floridas. The common impression was that they were of an arbitrary cast, and that for the enforcement of an object, intrinsically just & right, their power was almost unlimited. It was most probably in this view of the subject that he acted: & therefore I do not think that the case demands more than the disapprobation of these measures: so far as the violence offered to the person & property of the Spanish commissioner, & the warrant or citation to Judge Fromentin go. Whether a prompt and voluntary disclaimer should be tendered to the Spanish Government is a point on which I have not yet had time to think."
<pb#278 />
I thank you for your kind enquiries for my health. I have not yet recovered my strength or capacity for long continued exertion—but I
am in my office and working when I can. One of the properties that marks the sickness of this fall is the very slow recovery of the sufferers.—We called to see M* and M.” Gouvernier & were much gratified to learn that you were all well & to find the two young people in such health & comparative spirits. I think you might safely venture down yourself for a few days but you must not think of bringing your family nor of coming yourself permanently as yet. I beg my respects to M** Monroe in which M” W. joins me—and I pray you to be assured of my friendship & devotion &

[Addressed] The President of the U. States
[Endorsed] Oct 11. 1821 Mr. Wirt. case of Judge Fromentin—
the Gov. Spanish powers, can we censure him for exercising them, in the Spanish way, especially in the furtherance of justice? If we hesitate, we may invite complaint, from the Spanish government, which ought to checked & not invited.
Why has this man run to Washington? Does he expect to be presented & make complaint, specially if his minister has withdrawn, after knowing of the occurrence, without making any? Mr Jefferson referrd me to an occurrence, which he thought similar, in his adm", the arrest of the Spanish agent who ran, with Ellicot the boundary line, at Baton rouge, & the seizure of the papers which he with held, the details of which he says may be found in Ellicots correspondence in the dep"
of State. Mr Jeffersons name, you will not mention, but the documents should be examind. I believe that Laussat the French agent was also laid hold, at N.
orleans, after the surrender of Louisiana. In the instance first mentiond, M*
Jefferson observ'd, that according to his recollection, the Spanish govt never complaind, knowing that its agent was in the wrong. Should I come down immediately, might I not invite complaint, & if it was supposed to be connected with the occurrence, give in consequence to it, to our disadvantage? When any mov’ment, is an affair of delicacy, & measures are substantially in the right train, tho' of a nature, to make even their sanction by the gov", the ground of complaint, as in the arrest of Mr Calava, it may be with Spain, & so far as it indicates a departure from our usages, with many among ourselves, untill the affair is better understood, the longer the government holds back & declines acting the better the effect may be. I suggest these ideas for your consideration.
If the laws of Spain are establishd by our law for the internal govt of the provinces, it follows, even if the district judge's jurisdiction extended the whole length, that he could not issue a writ of H. C., for such writ was never heard of, in a country where the inquisition & military despotism prevail. In every view therefore Mr Fromentin mistook his duty. I am persuaded, that so long & to such extent, has been the reign, & practice of corruption, in that country, that it will require, much energy, & decision, to root it out. A relaxd course may tend to sanction, every unprincipled claim under the preceeding governments. Its opposite, will make a stand against, & check, and as I hope suppress them.”

<docbody>MY DEAR GOVERNOR. I have the honor to forward to you by this mail, a letter from M. Penniers enclosing a memoir on East Florida–
Also a communication from the Department of State, and four private letters.
The most perfect tranquility reigns here—The Town is fast decreasing in population.
A little Admiralty case has occurred, which has occasioned some doubts to be raised (by those most friendly to the Government)
whether under my Commission from you as Governor of W. Florida, I have judicial powers to the extent of your decision in the case of Vidal vs Innerarity.” It has also been suggested that in your absence I may exercise all the powers which you exercised, by virtue of your Commissions within this Province. It has not become necessary for me to decide on this point, nor shall I do so (if it can be avoided)
until I have your advice on the subject.
Captain Ramage" came into our harbor a few days since, and informs me, that he has discovered a piratical rendezvous on the south side of Cuba, consisting of four armed vessels.—Capt" Ramage touched at Ship Island on his way here, and made an arrangement with Captain Kearney" to meet him off the Barrancas yesterday, and to sail in pursuit of these Pirates. I hope they will soon give a good account of them.
I have been much disappointed in not hearing by mail of your progress. My next communication will be addressed to you at Nashville.
I have the satisfaction of informing you that as far as I have heard of the elections in Georgia, it gives the promise of a complete triumph of Principle. Col. Cumming * has not succeeded in getting into the Legislature.
Present me in the Kindest manner to M” Jackson, & Miss Hays,"
and also to the Gentlemen of your family—particularly to D" Bronaugh, and assure him that I will do myself the pleasure of writing him by the next mail.

Accept my dear Governor, the renewed assurance of my high consideration and unalterable devotion.

<docbody>ANDREW JACKSON Esquire Governor of Florida.
SIR. I have had the honour of receiving your Letters of 30. July.”
26. August," and 1. September, with their respective enclosures which have been submitted to the consideration of the President of the United States.
I now inclose copy of a Letter which I have by his direction written to Judge Fromentin,” informing him that it was understood and intended that his jurisdiction should be confined to the execution of the only Laws of the United States which by act of Congress had been extended to the Territories of Florida, namely the Laws relating to the Revenue and its collection, and the Slave trade.
In the execution of these laws, which are of a nature, entirely distinct from those of Spain, operating in the Provinces, the President is of opinion that he should be amenable only to the Government of the United States.
I enclose also translations of a Letter from M' Salmon Charge d'Affaires of Spain," and of a Statement by Colonel Callava," relative to the arrest and detention of his person, and the forcible seizure, and abduction, under your authority, of certain papers which were in his possession, with a Copy of the answer given to the Letter of M*
<pb#281 />
Salmon"—Before an ultimate answer shall be given to the Spanish Minister,” upon this complaint, the President has thought it proper to transmit these Documents to you, with the purpose of receiving any remarks, either in relation to the facts alledged, or to the principles asserted in them, which you may think the occasion requires.
Appreciating, as the President does, the sense of duty under which you felt yourself compelled to resort to to these measures, and the objects of high impartial justice to which they were in your estimation rendered indispensable; I am directed to invite your attention to the following circumstances represented in these papers.
1. That Colonel Callava, claimed as of right the immunities, with reference to his person, to his dwelling house, and to his papers, which by the customary Laws of nations belong to public Commissioners appointed to negotiate or to execute Treaty stipulations between nation and nation.
2. That you had transacted business with him in the Capacity of a public Commissioner as late as third of August, three weeks after the day on which the surrender had been made of the Territory.
3. That the papers finally seized by your orders, had never been officially demanded, and that he had offered to deliver them or give adequate security that they should be delivered, if they should prove to be of the description of papers stipulated by the Treaty to be left in the Territory.
4. That at the time when he was forcibly brought before you, and required to submit to examination upon interrogatories, neither the questions asked of him, nor his answers were correctly interpretted.
It is proper to apprize you that in the opinion of the President, so far as Colonel Callava, could justly claim the Rights of a Commissioner for the surrender of the Territory, he was entitled to all the immunities which might be necessary for the execution of his trust, and which the Laws of Nations recognize as belonging to public Ministers—As authority for this opinion, I refer you to Wattal,”
Book 4. chap. 6 & S 75—and Chap. 9 & S 125
A different sentiment appearing from your Letter of the 26 August to have been entertained by you, it would be satisfactory to learn upon what grounds it had been taken up, or if the privileges incident to this immunity, had in your view ceased, it is desirable to know the considerations upon which you had so deemed of them; the view
<pb#282 />
taken of them in the answer to the note of M" Salmon, admitting the right only in general terms, and inferring that they had ceased by the act of surrender, and of reasonable time for departure, as well as by the limitation of the time for the surrender stipulated in the Treaty."
I shall reply as early as possible to the other subjects of your Letters, and in the mean time have the honour to be with great Respect, Sir, your very humble and obedient Servant.

SIR. I have had the honor of receiving your letters of 20.”26.” and

<pb#283 />
to the Slave trade, having been the only ones extended by act of Congress to the Territories of Florida, it was to the execution of them that your Commission as Judge of the United States was considered and intended to apply—The President thought the authority of Congress alone competent to extend other Laws of the United States to the newly acquired territories, nor could he give to the Judge a Jurisdiction which could be conferred only by them. There being an essential difference between the nature of the powers, heretofore exercised, by the Spanish authorities in those provinces, which were continued in force, by the Act of the 3" of March last” until the end of the next Session of Congress, unless a temporary Government should bee sooner established over them and of the Laws of the U. States, which were extended to those provinces by that Law, the President considered it his duty to entrust the execution of each branch to Officers Specially appointed for the purpose. In the execution of those Laws in your judicial capacity, the Governor has been informed that you are considered responsible only to the Government of the U. States.
In the different view which you have taken of the Subject, he is persuaded that your motives and intentions were entirely pure, though he deeply regrets the collision of authority and misunderstanding which have arisen between the Governor of the territory and you.”

<docbody>SIR. Presuming that the President would be desirous to be informed of the state of Affairs in this Province, I have thought it adviseable to communicate with the Department direct, not having yet heard of the arrival of the Governor at Nashville, for which place he set out on the eighth instant.
The Department is already fully informed of the disposition made by Gen' Jackson previous to his departure.” He was pleased to delegate to me the powers exercised by the former Governor of West Florida, accompanying my Commission with a letter of instructions.”
Since his departure, I have been in the exercise of those functions, and shall use my best exertions to justify the confidence of the President, and the expectations of General Jackson.
Nothing suggests itself at present of sufficient importance to communicate. All things go on well, and the march of the Government is peaceable and undisturbed.
The excitement occasioned by measures deemed necessary by the Governor, is subsiding, and since the departure of the Spanish Officers, there seems to be a much greater disposition on the part of the Spanish Inhabitants to cultivate a friendly feeling.
Nothing has been heard of Gen' Jackson since he left Claiborne; by this time I think it probable that he has reached the State of Tennessee.
I have the honor to be, with great consideration. Your Obdt Sevt.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor this moment to receive yours of yesterday”—
I think if the exegincies of the corporate Government of this City are not too pressing to be for a time postponed, a delay should take place, * Printed also in A. S. P., Misc., II, 896.
<pb#286 />
in collecting even “such Taxes as may be necessary for the support of the Town Government”—Because at this time, when the prevailing sickness has so much distressed the inhabitants, destroyed so many and driven numbers away, 'till this epidemic shall pass by If in levying the Taxes it should be necessary to seize on property and offer it for sale it would be literally sacrifised—But I understand the Taxes are disputed en masse by the citizens, because they say General Jackson in his Commission is restricted in levying or collecting any new or additional Taxes—that there never were any Taxes here before, of course the present are new—and that no person acting under him in the Floridas can levy or collect them—This opinion I am told is adopted from a publication in the Floridian of the 15" ulto. quoting General Jacksons commission as read in a law suit at Pensacola by the heirs of Vidal versus John Innerarity *—I think this is not a sufficient justification for any person in refusing to pay the Taxes—The great question is are the Taxes necessary and have they been imposed by the proper Tribunal—I have heard—no body deny one or the other, except those who seem to think a Government must support itself, not by a mild and open system of general and equal Taxation, but by drawing money from some other quarter of the union, or by keeping up the miserable expedient of exorbitant fees, perquisites, bribery and corruption—The publication in the Floridian is unofficial and cannot certainly impugn the power of the Mayor and City Council, expressly given them by General Jackson—The Commissions of the Mayor and City Council men were signed by General Jackson, exercising the powers of the Captain General of the Island of Cuba &". and countersigned by me as Secretary in and for East Florida They do not emanate from me, if they did there might be some doubt, as I am expressly restricted, and any one acting under me, in my Commission of the 1* of July from him *—
But I take it for granted he is not, or he would not so expressly have delegated the power in the 2* Sec. of Ordinance N° 1.—
Furthermore the commission of the 10" of March quoted in the Floridian,” is not the only commission issued by the President to General Jackson—He has had three—that of the 20" of March is now before me,” and this he enclosed to me, as my guide—The restrictive clause concerning Taxes or Grants is not in it—No doubt it is expected that as to Taxes no more shall be laid or collected than may be absolutely necessary—I would recommend you to try one case, where the inconveniencies of this crisis may not be felt—then lay the whole transactions before me, with the ordinances of the City Council
<pb#287 />
&c and I will transmit it to General Jackson for his decision I am certain neither he nor you nor myself wish any thing of the inhabitants of Florida, but what is right, constitutional and proper—And I am equally certain that the inhabitants of Florida are disposed on a fair understanding of things, to do all that is proper, constitutional and right—Therefore let us adopt the mildest and most conciliatory Cource-

N° 197. Power of the President to order the discharge of an Officer of U.S. arrested at the Suit of a citizen.—Capt: Bell's case. Acting Governor of Florida.
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE U. S.
November 5, 1821.
SIR, The letter of Abr" Eustis, from S*Augustine, of date 2 Oct.
last,” which you have done me the honor to refer to me, states—
“Capt. Bell is arrested at the suit of one Fairbanks whom he ordered to be confined in the Fort (for being concerned in negro-stealing)
before the civil government was organized and while he was acting
<pb#288 />
as provisional Governor.”—In your endorsement on this letter you inform me that “Capt Bell acted under the authority of Gen Jackson, in the place of M" Worthington until his arrival. It was for an act performed in that trust that he has been arrested”. Your question is whether the President can order his discharge?—
Had the case occurred in any state or any other territory of the United States, there would be no difficulty in answering the question in the Negative: nothing being clearer as a general position under the Constitution and laws of the U. States, than that the President has no right to interfere in a civil suit between two citizens. The Governors of all the territories and states, are answerable for torts done by them, under color of their office: they may plead, in their defence, that the act was lawfully done under the authority of their office, and if the defence be true in fact, it will avail them before the Court which tries the cause: but it is not in the power of the President to interfere, in any manner, with the progress and termination of the suit. It would be monstrous if it were otherwise in a republican government since under the English monarchy the governor of a distant province, armed both with civil and military power, was held subject to the action of an individual in England, and amerced in very heavy damages for a tresspass and false imprisonment: I allude particularly to the case of Martyn vs. Fabrigas. Cowper's Reports
161. Such is the answer which I should give to the question had the case occurred anywhere else within our limits, than in the Floridas:
but as the matter stands the question refers itself to a system of foreign Laws with which I am not acquainted.
The Constitution (article 4* Section 3 clause 2) declares that
“Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States”.—In the exercise of this power Congress at the last session by the act for carrying into execution the treaty between the U. S. and Spain provided “that untill the end of the first session of the next Congress unless provision for the temporary government of said territories (the Floridas) be sooner made by congress, all the military, civil and judicial powers exercised by the officers of the existing government of the same territories shall be vested in such person or persons and shall be exercised in such manner as the President of the U.S. shall direct &" In pursuance of this act Gen Jackson received a commission which clothed him with all the powers of the Governor and Captain General of Cuba over these provinces; and it was while acting as his substitute that Capt Bell did the act which subjected him to the suit of Fairbanks. If the Governor and Captain General of Cuba was, at the time, of the enactment of this law, was in the exercise of a power which authorized him to discharge an ex Governor of Florida from civil suits; for acts done in his capacity
<pb#289 />
of Governor, Governor Jackson having succeeded to the same power, may discharge, in like manner, the ex governor Capt Bell from the suit of Fairbanks, and if possessing the power he declines exercising it, spontaneously, then, as he is to act under your instructions, you may instruct him to do it. The question—therefore as to your power, depends on the Constititution and laws of the Spanish Monarchy, with regard to the government of its provinces, with which I am not sufficiently acquainted to answer the question proposed to me. The extent of these powers as they were actually exercised in the Floridas
(the criterion assumed by the act of Congress) can be more easily and safely ascertained on the theatre of their exercise, and by those who can have access to the records and archives of the provinces while under the Government of Spain, than by us at this distance and the disadvantages under which we labor. Governor Jackson, or his representative might, if you think proper be instructed to examine both the merits of the particular case of M* Bell and the extent of the power, and to examine it or not as the justice of the case might seem to require or to report to you for your farther consideration.
I shall only observe in closing, that even if the power should be found to exist, it is so entirely at war with our political institutions and modes of thinking, that nothing can render its exercise palatable or even endurable, but the averting of some extreme injustice which cannot be otherwise avoided & if M Eustis statement may be relied on such injustice seems to be threatened in the case of Capt Bell.”

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to enclose herewith a letter received from Don Fernando de la Maza Arredondo addressed to the Secretary of War," on the subject of an intended location & survey of a grant of land by the Captain Gen' of Cuba to Arredondo & Son in 1817 for
<pb#290 />
about 400,000 acres or eight leagues square in the Alachua country"—
I understand two of the conditions of said grant to be, that it shall be without injury to a third person and particularly to the native Indians of the soil, or country. I am not yet aware how far, the consent of the Indians has been obtained relative to this grant, my impression however is that not a single condition named in the grant has been legally complyed with, as far as it respects the consent of the Indians—
I shall be able to assertain fully at the talk appointed to be held at Alachua on the 20" instant I have said in reply to Arredondos application for permission to survey the track imbraced in the grant alluded to, that I am not authorized to give permission to any person or persons to make a settlement on lands belonging to the Indians, or to survey or attempt to survey or designate any boundaries by marking trees or otherwise within the limits of the Indian country of Florida, which limits or boundaries was settled by the English and Indians at a talk held at Picolata on the 18 Nov 1765 * which also appears to have been admitted and acknowledged by the Spanish authorities at a talk held at Pensacola in May 1784 * and in all treaties and talks since whenever boundaries or lands has been spoken of, without particular instructions from the department of war—
If I am incorrect in not allowing surveying parties to traverse the Indian country without the authority of the Gov" of the United States, it is desirable that I receive more particular instructions on the subject, as soon as practicable, for until I do, not a settler or an attempt at suvey will be permitted by me in the Indian country—
I have not the least doubt but that the Spanish authorities have uniformily admitted the right of the Indians to the country within certain limits expressed in the treaty of 1765 made by the English and Indians renewed again and confirmed by the Spaniards in 1784, altho' the treaties or copies of them are not to be found here; the treaty of 84 was here in 1813, for we find that Don Onis * was at that time furnished with a copy of it—However on examining the Archives taken from the late Spanish officers at this place enough has been found and retained in my opinion to satisfy the Gov" that the grants made by the late Spanish government here, of lands in the Indian territory without providing for the extinguishing of the Indian tittle, will be null and void—
<pb#291 />
The grants by the Capt General of Cuba as well as I understand, conditions, that the consent of the Indians must be had in all cases before a suvey can take place—I have lately discovered a considerable stir among the Spanish inhabitants who hold grants, and who have been forbid going into the Indian country to trade as license can only be granted to an American citizen or those who have taken the oath of allegiance to the United States.

I hope the remainder of this unpleasant Controversy will terminate speedily & equally amicable.
I have laid the whole dispute both before you & him—
I feel that all the disagreeable parts of my administration of this Province, have in a manner drawn to a close & Genl Jackson has approved, both of my sentiments & acts—I trust the President will have no cause to complain of me—

“You, whilst acting as the Executive of East Florida, have a right to occupy the Government House, and the military must be supplied with Quarters in the Fort or town or other Public Buildings, it is true, I resigned the Government House here to the Officers, because I found it in decay, and that by yielding it to the officers and renting for my self, there would be a great saving to the Public”—
So soon as it will suit your convenience and that of such of the officers and troops as may occupy the Gov' House and premises to give me and my family possession under this opinion of General Jackson, it will much oblige me, as I wish to move my furniture and Servants in it this week and bring my family in the beginning of next—I shall be sorry to put these officers to any inconvenience, but as I believe they are all single Gentlemen I presume their removal to, I hope, as comfortable Quarters will be of little consequence to them—
I desire it to be distincly understood both by you and them, that I
wish to act under this opinion of General Jackson, with the utmost delicacy and friendship towards them—
Will you do me the favor to inform me as early as your convenience will permit, when ocupation may be had of the premises.

SIR I have the honor to acknowledge your Communication of yesterday: The opinion of Governor Jackson respecting the Government House will be acceded to without delay. The Kitchen and two rooms on the first floor are now vacant and your Servants and Furniture may be sent there as soon as you think proper.—The third Basement room is at present occupied by the family of a Serjeant of Captain Bell's Company. He and his Wife's Sister are now very
<pb#294 />
sick with Yellow Fever, but they shall be removed as soon as practicable either to the Grave or to other quarters.—I have ordered Doctor M°Coskry and Captain Bell to vacate the rooms occupied by them before Monday next.—A temporary stable has been erected by the Quarter Masters Department in an enclosure belonging to the premises and separated from the habitable part of the building by a high Wall.—
Access may be had to it without entering the Court yard. If we can continue to occupy it, it will afford accomodation to the U. S. and officers horses; but if there be the slightest objection on your part, I will cause the building to be removed immediately to some other public lot.—One half of the Garden has been tilled and a portion of it planted by the Soldiers. Be pleased to inform me whether they may continue to cultivate and reap the Crop. I fear that without very considerable expence you will not be able to make this Building comfortable for your family.—
I avail myself of this occasion to assure you that I shall be happy at all times to afford you the aid of my Command for the purpose of enforcing the Laws or of enabling you to administer the Government according to your Instructions.-
I hope and trust that the harmony which has hitherto existed between the Civil and Military Departments in East Florida may continue undisturbed and I tender you the assurance of the personal Esteem Consideration and Respect of Your humble Servant ABR" EUSTIs, L' Col.

<docbody>Dr SIR, In my letter of the 5" Ult” I advised you that the organization of the Government of the Floridas was complete and that it was my intention to leave Pensacola for my residence in this state in a few days. I now have the satisfaction to inform you that I arrived here on the 5* Inst: with my family, all except one Servant, in ordinary health. As yet, I have been disappointed in receiving any communications from Florida since I left it, and cannot therefore
<pb#295 />
say, whether it will be necessary for me to return there before the meeting of Congress; but should any thing occur there, to render my presence necessary, you may rest assured that I will repair thither without delay.
I have this day enclosed to the Secretary of State for your information, copies of the correspondence between Judge Fromentin and myself," with the certificates which accompanied my last letter to him, & with two others, which completely establishes the fact, that he stated falsehoods knowingly & wilfully, in his letter to me. This I
found necessary as it appears that he has had the hardihood to stir this subject in the public prints, and has circulated the correspondence, as I suppose, without the certificates.
As I informed you in my last, having fully organized the Government and set it in operation, this fulfills the condition upon which I
accepted the appointment. By D" Bronaugh who will hand you this, I send enclosed my resignation, requesting that at as early a day, as will suit your convenience, you will appoint a successor and accept my resignation, that I may be relieved from the duties assigned me and retire to private life.”

<docbody>GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON Nashville Tenn:
SIR, I have received your letters of the 17* & 20* Sept’,” the first, containing a Copy of an unauthorized talk held with the Indians in Florida by a Mr Dexter and M. Wanton, the latter, a copy of a talk held with them by yourself and a letter written by you to Gen.'
McIntosh.
The view which you have taken in relation to the Indians generally and particularly of those in Florida, appear very correct. I entirely concur with you that it is perfectly absurd to hold treaties with those within our limits as they neither are or can be independent of our government. This opinion has been frequently communicated to Congress, and although they have not yet adopted it, I still hope they will ultimately.
By its adoption, both ours and their interest would be advanced and all of the objections which may be urged against almost every Indian Treaty which has been made be then avoided. As it regards the Indians in Florida, I can entertain no doubt, but that it would be expedient to remove them entirely out of limits of Florida, for the reasons you have assigned, and such also is the opinion of the President;
but he is of opinion that it would be improper for that purpose without the sanction of Congress & a special appropriation to resort to force or to incur any considerable expenditure.
Should there appear to be any prospect at the next session to effect so desirable an object it will be brought before Congress. If, however, nothing better can be done than to concentrate them in Florida, the part which you propose, appears to me to be the most eligible.
I have by the direction of the President appointed Cap" Bell agent during your absence from Florida and Cap" Pelham sub agent to fill the vacancy which has been occasioned by the death of M"
Pennieres. I enclose you a copy of my instructions to the former.
When I drew them up I had not your last communication, and was not apprized of the extent to which Dexter & Wanton had carried their assumption of power to act with the Indians, having at that time only received some communications from them to Cap" Bell giving information in relation to the Indians; but even on those, I
did not doubt but they were unprincipled individuals, who ought
<pb#299 />
to be removed from the Indian Country. Your letter with its enclosures leaves no doubt as to the correctness of this impression.
M. Pennieres had no instructions from this Department to proceed to the Havana to obtain any information connected with the discharge of his duty; and I presume, he had come to that determination under an erroneous view of his general instructions which directed him to report such information as he might obtain on the cessions which had been made by the Indians to the Spanish & English governments.
I have directed Cap" Bell to give Richards the appointment of Interpreter which you recommend and the sum which you have paid to him will be allowed. Since I received your last, M. Brown to whom you refer has called on me; and as I do not doubt from the high manner in which you speak of him that he is well qualified for any place connected with the Indian Department in Florida, I would readily have conferred on him the appointment of Sub Agent if the place had not been previously filled by Cap' Pelham.

DEAR GENERAL, Nothing of interest has transpired at this place since the date of my last”—We are getting along quite smoothely—
<pb#301 />
The system of Jurisprudence established by your excellency appears to have an admirable effect. The defaulting debtor is compelled to render to his creditor his due—the wrongdoer is brought to speedy justice, and the felon and disturber of the peace and good order of the community are adequately punished. Our court is resorted to both by Spaniards and Americans, in which they all appear to have the most implicit confidence. In short, all parties seem willingly to submit to the silent but efficient operation of the law. I can say for myself that since the date of that commission with which your Excellency has been pleased to honor me, no exertions on my part have been wanting to justify that confidence which your Excellency appeared to repose in me, and I have the vanity to believe that those exertions have not been entirely fruitless, and that I have the good fortune to possess the confidence of the citizens generally—to maintain and support which I have now two motives—for tho my own pride of character would at all times form a strong inducement to act with propriety, whenever the the reputation of your excellency becomes at all identified with that of mine, I can say that so far as the frailties of human nature will permit, your excellency shall be shielded from censure on my account. I believe however that the only objection ever made to my appointment as presiding justice, was grounded on my want of age; an objection, which I hope I have shown, in the discharge of my judicial functions, is in some measure removed, by my long experience in the forum of Judicial proceedings.
We have a complete record of all all our proceedings which we will be able to transfer to any court which may be substituted in our stead under any new organization. The mode of our proceedings are very summary—one debt of $1200 has been collected under execution in one month from the commencement of suit, and several smaller sums with equal dispatch.
Before I conclude there is one subject to which I would beg leave to call the attention of your Excellency—I mean my compensation as presiding Justice of Escambia county. It is true the ordinance of your Excellency allows me some fees; but these are found to be entirely inadequate to compensate me for the labour and responsibility attending my situation. The duties of my office require almost the whole of my time, and I do not candidly believe I will be able to realize more than $150. or $200. from the fees allowed. If, under these circumstances, your Excellency could do something towards procuring from the government an adequate and liberal compensation it, would be adding to the many obligations under which you have already laid me. I am the more solicitous on this subject as I find it will be impossible, if the Gov't does not make mesome allowance, (altho' my whole time is devoted to the service of the public)
for me to pay my expences out of the proceeds of my industry, -
<pb#302 />
which is the only means I have of support. I would also suggest the propriety of making my associates some allowance, who have served the public faithfully, to the exclusion of their private business.—Do be so good as to write me en this subjeet, and let me know, your disposition one this subject.
Give my compliments to Mrs. Jackson and Miss Hays—I suppose Andrew * has almost forgotten me—I hope, however, he attends to his books—I see your enemies make some noise in the papers relative to the Callava business; but the great body of the American people cannot but approve of your conduct.—Accept, dear sir, my warmest wishes for your health and happiness.

SIR, An impression is generally prevalent here, that a Revenue Cutter will be employed on the part of the Florida Coast comprized within this district, and that the Government will perhaps think proper to make this port, the station for such vessel, and extending her cruizing ground so as to embrace the district of S’ Augustine, or East Florida, thereby including the Cape of Florida, and that part of the coast which is at present the rendezvous of a number of individuals emphatically called wreckers: there are at present, as I am informed by the Master of an American Wessel lately entered here from that Coast, about forty sail employed in prosecuting that business as a profession, the commanders of which openly own their intention to continue on that ground untill they shall be ordered off by the authorities of the U. S. of which they expressed themselves the belief they should shortly have efficient notice: They will not probably be allowed much longer to continue to find facilities in prosecuting that business within the jurisdiction of the U.S. The property of the vessels in that employ is for the most part said to belong to British merchants.

At the request of an individual by the name of David Hall, I enclose to you sundry letters in support of his desire to be appointed to the command of the Revenue Cutter in case it should be deemed expedient to employ a Wessel as such, upon this Coast. Mr Hall I am informed has much experience in the navigation of the Gulph of Mexico, and is well acquainted with the Coast of both the Floridas.
Some uneasiness exists here on the part of individuals holding property, merchandise and Slaves, which was in this place at the time of the cession; from the circumstance of the injunction that prevent its removal hence to any other part of the U. States. Mr Lewis informed me before leaving this, that he had represented in his communications to your department, that the actual amount of property commercially considered, remaining here, at that period, was very inconsiderable and hardly of any importance. My own observation, since arriving, fully confirms his remark—indeed the general impression in the minds of the commercial community in our Eastern Cities, that was so predominant in May and June last, that this place would be overstocked with supplies of every description, has resulted in producing a contrary state, for the consignments here as yet been very limited, and there is nothing like a general assortment of any description of goods in the place, though most probably the present absence of merchandise, will be followed in February or March next, by an excess of abundance, which will doubtless prove injurious to many individuals though eventually of advantage to the place.
The Surveyor M' Ch." Jenkins arrived here on Wednesday the 14.
instant, he called on me and in conversation stated he had been induced to visit this place from information he had received, in reply to the enquiry addressed by him to the Secretary of the Territory, whether his presence here was indispensable; being informed that it was, he had with much inconvenience to himself, undertaken the journey. I entered, as minutely as was in my power into a statement of the transactions at this office since the commencement of business, laying before him the Books, and copies of the accounts as transmitted to the Comptroller of the Treasury department to the 30" of September. M Jenkins expressed himself satisfied that the journey might have been very well deferred till such time as the decision of Congress upon the amount of salary to be allowed the officers of the Customs at this Port had been made known, and that as he could not decide without that information whether he should permanently reside here, it did not appear necessary that he should qualify, by taking the requisite oaths and executing his Bond, he would therefore defer so doing for the present, and should return to his residence in Georgia;
he left town on the afternoon of the 16" of M" Scotts movement I am altogether unadvised. My belief with regard to the performance of the duties appertaining to the officers of the Customs at this port, is
<pb#304 />
that they can be fully discharged by one person, and that the commerce of the place will not, under its present prospects, for some time to come afford employment for more, and barely a subsistance for one, provided the salary at present allowed is continued.
In considering the appropriations of money that Congress have from time to time, made, for the improvement of the Ports and harbours of our Country, a belief naturally arises, that our new acquisition will receive attention on that score, in proportion to the advantages to be obtained in improving the local situations by the expenditure of requisite funds in the attainment of those ends which may at once subserve the public interest and the local prosperity of the place. I venture therefore, Sir, to suggest for consideration the building and erecting a Wharf at this Port; at present there is nothing of the kind, every thing being landed on the open beach: the expense of such a work must be considerable, the distance not being less than 180 or 200 yards; the proper materials are found in abundance within the district though not in the immediate vicinity, as the piles or supporters of the plat form, must be a wood which the worms do not destroy.
I have not had the honor of receiving any communication from you, since my arrival at this place; I beg Sir you will receive the assurances of perfect respect with which I am Your &" &"
Ray- No signature to this letter either.

<docbody>SIR. The disease which visited this place during the last season with such raging mortality, has happily subsided—Considerable confusion has, and yet prevails here, among the several officers of government as to their powers, and I feel confident that nothing less than the timely interposition of Congress can restore harmony and order in this place—I hope the subject will meet the early attention of Congress—
Gov. Jackson has written to Secretary Worthington giving him authority to appoint a Clerk for the Federal court in E. Florida.
Under a belief that such an act would not be either legal or proper, I feel it my duty to reject any that may be so appointed and shall appoint a Clerk myself—If you should think otherwise on your advice or direction I will act—If the President has not appointed and intends to appoint commissioners to decide on the land titles of E.

Permit me to enquire whether the President has fixed on the allowance intended for the U.S judge of E.

Recommendation of William King by Inhabitants of West Florida

TO JAMES MONROE President of the United States.
The inhabitants of West Florida respectfully represent—That Whereas under a Territorial Government, the happiness and prosperity of its people must be greatly dependant on the virtue, intelligence and capacity of its Governor, and having been informed of the intended resignation of His Excellency Major General A. Jackson, We beg leave most respectfully to recommend as his successor, Col:
William King, late of the Army of the United States. To most of us Col: King is personally known; during the occupancy of this Country in 1818 by the American Government, Col King exercised the Civil and Military Authority of this Province, in the administration of which, his conduct was marked by a zeal and fidelity for the interests of his Country, and a sense of justice and propriety, which has secured to him the confidence and respect of those, over whom he presided.
He is the choice of the People—He possesses those qualifications, and those principles, which will enable him to discharge his duties, with honor to himself and to the Country.

<docbody>To the Hon. the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, fin Congress Assembled, at Washington—
Your Petitioners, Citizens of West Florida most respectfully beg leave to represent; That they settled on vacant Lands in the said Florida, early in the year one thousand eight hundred and nineteen;
that they have made valuable and extensive improvements and are still in the actual occupation of said Lands; that the taking possession
80 Not found.
<pb#311 />
and the occupying of Lands, in a Country, then a wilderness, met the full and entire approbation of the Authorities in Florida; and that your Petitioners expected to have received from the said Authorities, each 800 Arpens of Land (which is the usual quantity allowed to an actual settler by the Colonial Laws of Spain) had the Country not been ceeded and surrendered to the United States—But since the change of the Sovreignty of the Country, your petitioners look forward to the bounty of Congress, in expectation that their hopes will be as amply realized, as they would have been from the Government, under whose auspices their rights originated; When your petitioners reflect on the relief granted to others, similarly situated, in Missouri, Mississippi and Louissiana States, they have the most sanguine expectations that they will be rewarded for their toil and the difficulties encountered in the settlement of a new Country by the Government of the United States extending to them the same, wise, just and liberal course of policy—
Your petitioners by recuring to the various Acts of Congress which have been passed on the subject of public Lands, not only in the States above named, but in that portion of Florida west of the Perdido, find that Congress have invariably Granted to each actual settler
(who inhabited or cultivated a tract of Land on or before the day of the final evacuation of the Spanish Authorities therein) a Donation of Six hundred and forty acres of Land including their improvements:
the acts refered to, without reciting their dates, are embraced within the period of time, from 1798 to 1819 and are worthy the attention of future generations, as the Acts of a magnanimous and generous Nation—
Your petitioners further represent; that when we established ourselves, in this Section of Country it was a Wilderness; and instead of the Government of the United States loosing by your petitioners being confirmed in their Titles, the Interests of the Country have been greatly promoted by our establishments; thereby creating inducements to others to purchase and settle in the Country-
Your Petitioners having full confidence in the justice of their claims, and reasonableness of their solicitations most respectfully pray that Congress will make such provision by a general Law or such special Acts of relief, as will embrace their cases and place their claims on a similar footing with those, who in similar situations have preceeded your Petitioners—
All which is most respectfully submitted by your petitioners and as in duty bound will ever pray-

<docbody>SIR/ Since 1 had the honor to address you, * nothing very material has occurred except the arrival of the Hornet Capt” Henley *bringing in the armed Brig Centinella of 18 Guns captured by him as Pirates;
Judge Fromentin having given his opinion that he could not take cognizance of the case, I had no doubt that I could myself take cognizance of it, as in a case of Piracy which was tried before Gov" Callava referring the sentence & the evidence to the Capt" General for his approbation—but as they could only be tried here by the Laws of
<pb#313 />
Spain and the instructions of Capt” Henley required him to carry his prizes where they could be adjudicated by the Laws of the United States—they must therefore necessarily be carried elsewhere.
I have learned that a decision has been made by the President in relation to the Public buildings at St Augustine, in which, from being similarly situated, the Civil Officers here are also interested—
Gen' Jackson had previously given a similar opinion, & would have taken possession of the Government House here but that he was unwilling to remove his family from the house which they had occupied previously to the surrender of the Provinces. By this decision, while I am administering the Gov' of West Florida, I am entitled to occupy the Government House which was intended for and always has been the residence of the Governors of the Province. But it being at present occupied by Eight Officers to whom it was given up by Gen' Jackson and being in the immediate vicinity of the Block houses where the Troops are quartered, and fronting on the only ground near the City which is suitable for a parade; for these reasons, as well as to save a considerable sum to the Government which would otherwise be expended in procuring Quarters for the Officers, while at the same time they would be dispersed through the Town, I have thought proper not to break thro' the arrangements made by Gen' Jackson on this subject, but to follow the course which he had adopted in this respect and which I hope and believe will be approved by the President; I
have therefore rented a house for my family at Fifty dollars per month which (considering the high rents of this City) will not I presume be deemed extravagant—and if any difficulty should arise in the adjustment of the account with the War Department, I presume it may be obviated by the Secretary of the Department in his instructions to the Quarter Master.
I have not yet been informed of the amount of salary which has been affixed to my Office, but repose with confidence on the liberality of the President in this respect, but I would beg leave respectfully to suggest, that acting as Governor I have been compelled to incur expenses, which, as Secretary, would have been avoided, and which indeed have necessarily been greater from succeeding in Office a man so liberally hospitable in his manners and of so extensive reputation and acquaintance.”
I have the honor to be with the highest consideration Yr Obdt Servt.

<docbody>SIR—The Indian Agent, Capt" Bell has returned here—He reported to me on yesterday that the Indians were out hunting & he failed in assembly them in the Alachua, as he had intended on the
20th Ulto.—I despatched after him a Talk & preliminary Articles of a Treaty, with a letter, but they did not reach him—However I will enclose you copies of them by next mail—So that you may see my views of the subject—
On Indian affairs, I have only to observe, that, the best opinion I
can obtain from them, is that they are willing to be Concentrated in Florida, and that they would prefer the place assigned for them, to be where their principal Towns are—which would include a territory of about 80 miles long & 50 wide—and is the best part of Florida—
It is said, they never will consent to go up amongst the Creeks—They will assume no hostile attitude, against the United States, no matter, what Course they may adopt respecting them—But if they are ordered up amongst the Creeks, they will take to the bushes—
Not having yet been amongst them, I cannot say if this be absolutely correct—I feel it my duty to lay it before you—My own opinion as expressed to you in my letter of the 12" Ult° * remains still unchanged—Should I feel it necessary to make some disbursements as Superintendent, of Indian affairs, be pleased to point out to me the fund whence they are to be drawn?—

<dochead>PRESENTMENT OF THE GRAND JURY OF EAST FLORIDA</dochead>
<source>[NA:SD, Applications:C]</source>
<place-time>[December 6, 1821]</place-time>
<docbody>At a District Court held in the City of S*Augustine Territory of East Florida, on the 5th Decem" 1821.
The Grand Jury of the District Court of the United States for the District of East Florida before they retire from the duties with which they have been honored beg leave to present to his honor Judge Duval, their welcome to this Territory. And to assure him that they with truth felicitate their fellow Citizens and the Territory at large upon his accession to the bench of this Court Convinced that under his administration of the laws of the Territory every right which belongs to them as Citizens of the American Republic will be secured to them.
They present to this Hon: Court the inconvenience to which this Province is subjected, in the establishment and Continuation of the Spanish laws. When it is taken into Consideration that those laws, are inconsistent with the principles and genius of a republican Government, that they are unknown, having never been officially promulgated or published within this territory And when it is also further thdersteed Considered that the Spanish population within this territory does not exceed the number of two thousand souls (Slaves encluded) and that number daily decreasing by their removal to the Island of Cuba, It must be admitted that every rational hope which may be entertained of the early prosperity of this territory must be founded upon the population wealth and enterprise & industry of the American States: That population then whose earliest impressions and most cherish" Ideas of Civil liberty & Government have grown and been matured under the influence of American institutions, is the population whose good will is to be conciliated in the formation of any system of laws for the future Government of this Territory under these impressions the Grand Jury beg leave to represent that the adoption of the principles of the common law as they exist in the several states will be more congenial to their feelings and habits and best calculated, to preserve the blessings of liberty to themselves and their decendents. They further represent as a greivance and as a Serious injury to the Commerce of the United States the Situation of the Florida Keys that Harbours Contiguous thereto have become the resort of wreckers and pirates and would respectfully suggest to the General Government the propriety and utility of stationing a naval and military force in that neighbourhood, for the purpose of suppressing those disorders.
They also represent the absolute necessity of establishing a light house near the entrance of this port, they are impressed with the belief that it may be the means of saving much property jeopardised for want of such an establishment.
<pb#316 />
They also further represent as a grievance That there are no funds in the province and no means whereby the expences of the territory can be defrayed That as all charges of Government; were paid from the Royal treasury of Spain there existed previous to the Cession no necessity for taxes and Consequently none were laid This grand Jury therefore trusting in the liberality and wisdom of Congress hope that a fund may be placed at the disposal of the proper officers sufficient to defray all the expences of the territory.
The grand jury request that this Hon: Court will forward this presentment to the President of the United States to be laid before Congress. That such measures may be adopted by that Honb body as in their wisdom they may determine upon.

<place-time>[Referred December 7 1821]</place-time>
To the honorable, the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled, The Petition of the undersigned respectfully sheweth, That they are settled upon vacant lands within the limits of the territory of Florida, and were in the possession and the actual occupancy of the places they still cultivate, prior to the change of the Flags therein by Spain and the United States;—
And your Petitioners do further represent to your honorable bodies, that when they settled upon their respective plantations in Florida their settlements met the approbation of the Spanish Authorities therein, and that your Petitioners were encouraged to believe that each one of them would have been allowed by the Spanish Government to remain in the use and occupation of their plantations, and be finally entitled to 800 arpens of land (which is the usual quantity allowed to an actual Settler by the Spanish colonial laws) had the Floridas not been ceded and surrendered to the United States; But since the change of government there your Petitioners have no other security for their places than the pleasure of the Congress of the United States, which they hope and trust will be as just and liberal in behalf of the undersigned as it has been towards the actual settlers heretofore in the Mississippi, Louisiana, and Missouri.-
<pb#317 />
In recurring to the various acts of Congress, which have from time to time been passed for the adjustment of the land claims throughout the States above named, as well as in that portion of West Florida lying west of the river Perdido, your Petitioners find that Congress have invariably and uniformly granted to each actual settler, (“who inhabited or cultivated a tract of land on or before” the day of the final evacuation of the Spanish authorities therein,) a Donation of
640 acres of land including their improvements. And your Petitioners, being unable to discover any difference in the merits of the claims of actual settlers east of Perdido river, and those west thereof which have been respected by Congress from the year 1798 to April 1813, have a right to expect that similar acts of relief will be extended to them in like cases; not only because they have obtained under the Spanish Jurisdiction similar inchoate titles to their places; but because they believe, that Congress will, on account of the thin and sparse population of the Floridas at present find it sound policy to hold out liberal encouragement to actual settlers, to induce them to remain upon the soil they occupy in order to strengthen the physical force of the country.
Your Petitioners, having full confidence in the justice of their respective claims, and of the reasonableness of their solicitations most respectfully pray that Congress will make such provisions by a general law, or special acts of relief, as will embrace thier cases, by placing their settlement claims upon the same footing as have been accorded to all actual settlers in similar circumstances in the above named States and Territories;
And as in duty bound your Petitioners will ever pray.

<docbody>MY DEAR GENERAL I forward to you by this mail two communications (containing in all 17 pieces) from M Worthington—All accounts received here from E. Florida represent the people of that Territory as highly dissatisfied with the state of affairs there. I fear that, that fellow Forbes has too much influence with M Worthington. I regret extremely it was not in your power to visit St. Augustine previous to your return to Tennessee; had you done so, the present unpleasant state of things would never have existed—The correspondence between M. Worthington & Capt" Bell" does not, in my opinion reflect much credit on either of those Gentlemen.—
The Nashville Whig of 7* Nov. announces your arrival at your Seat in Tennessee on the 4" of that month. I take it for granted that since your arrival at home, you have been busily engaged in arranging your papers preparatory to D" Bronaugh's visit to Washington City. I most ardently and sincerely hope, that General Jesup will be in Washington before the Doctor leaves there—Although the Gen'in a conservation with me, expressed himself, as warmly attached to you, yet I cannot but say that I have my doubts—his visit to this Country I view as somewhat extraordinary. I am well aware of his devotion to M Clay and M Crawford—I am decidedly of opinion that M” Adams cannot be elected President of the United States, and in my humble opinion, You are General, the only man in the Nation, who can thwart the views of Mr Crawford.—Let it be Known that you are a Candidate for the Presidency of the United States, and the descendents of those men, who, by their acts, emancipated us from the yoke of George Third, will rally around you—The agriculturists of the Nation are decidedly in your favor. I touch this subject with regret, because I am well aware of your reluctance to be even considered as a Candidate for that appointment—My father fought and shed his blood in the cause of the Revolution and as his only descendant, I
cannot reconcile it to my feelings to see such a man as M* Crawford, * House Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., p. 27. ”See ante, p. 214, et seq.

a man whom I believe to be destitute of all those principles which ought of right to belong to the Chief Magistrate of the greatest nation in the world, at the head of this Republic. If common rumor is to be believed, the present Chief Magistrate of this Country is governed in a great measure by M Crawford—If this be the fact, a few months more & I shall be permitted to retire from Office, for I feel satisfied that the Representation from Georgia, if not openly, will secretly be opposed to my receiving any Appointment from the Gov't of the U.S. in the Floridas.—
The enormous expense incurred in removing my family to this Country & the uncertainty of my drafts on Government being paid immediately, renders my situation extremely unpleasant, but I will endeavour to think and act like a Roman of the Augustan age, who said “let a crushed world tumble on him, and he would view the ruins undismayed”-
I have endeavoured to follow strictly the example set me by yourself while in the exercise of the Gov" and also by your letter of instructions," in consequence of which, I am inclined to believe that the administration of the Government has given general satisfaction. I
have exercised the Gov" with energy & at the same time I trust, with moderation. That Sapient Judge (Fromentin) but rarely crawls out of his shell—the lashing given him by Nicholas a few weeks since I think has put him down forever, even in Pensacola-
I feel satisfied that I shall have the pleasure of receiving a communication from you next mail.
I have the honor to be with the highest consideration—yr obdt Servt GEO WALTON

<docbody>SIR. The Comptroller of the Treasury having referred me to the department of State for instructions on the subject of the Slave Acts, I beg the favour of an answer to the following questions:—
By the Act of March 2" 1807. 7" & 8" Sections,” Slaves imported into the United States, previously to the 1* Jany 1808, are permitted to be transported from one port to another in the United States, and held to service or sold. Under the provisions of this act, and the act in relation to the cession of the Floridas to the United States of 3."
March 1819. Section 2** May Slaves, whether imported into this Territory either before or since the 1" of January 1808, be transported from this territory, coastwise, into any of the States of the Union there to be sold or held to Service?"
Some of the Spanish Inhabitants of this City are desirous of visiting

the Havana, and wish to take with them their domestic Slaves, as personal Servants, and to bring them back in a few months. I
presume there can be no objections to the taking of the Slaves away, but I can find no provision in any of the Slave acts for their return.
I Should therefore be glad to know whether permission may be granted, in these particular cases, to bring back to this Territory domestic Slaves taken away with the owners, inhabitants of this territory, to the Havana?"—

<docbody>SIR, I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of date Oct’ 6” last," and the accompanying account for extra pay whilst you were in the performance of the duties of Sec of East Florida with the powers of the former Go" thereof. I had heretofore brought to the veiw of the Sec of State your services and requested that a proper allowance should be made, compensating you service and meeting whatever expences may have been incurred in the discharge of those duties.” In order however that this subject may not escape the attention of the Sec', I have transmitted your account to him, and requested that it may be allowed and paid, it being both reasonable and just.
<pb#324 />
The regret which I feel at the heartburning which has arisen between you and the civil authority, does not lessen my approbation of your conduct in securing the troops under you command in cumfortable quarters and in using every means to free them from disease.
All the Public buildings of course belong to the U States, and next to the Actg. Governor, who for the time being is entitled to occupy one of them, the officers and Troops should have been quartered in those Public buildings—After this (if to be spared) a house belonging to the Public should have been appropriated as a Court House.: But the Marshal is neither, nor was he ever more entitled to a Public building than any other individual in the City. The Corporation of the city ought to be indulged in a Public house if to be spared from other public uses. In Pensacola I yielded the Gov' House to the military, and quartered the soldiers in the Block houses. The Judiciary and Corporation rented a house for their Public purposes, and I
rented a house for myself. I therefore see nothing in your conduct in this particular nor in any other, which I can condemn, nor do I
believe that you can be injured by the persecution against you.
Y* conduct as far as I am enabled to judge Sir, has been perfectly satisfactory to me I am Sir with great respect Y" Mo Ob' Servant

<place-time>PENSACOLA December 17* 1821.</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR GENERAL, The pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of your favor of 13" November * is mine. Your friends here are highly pleased that yourself and family have reached the “Hermitage” in safety and they all feel highly delighted at the handsome and brilliant reception given to you by the Citizens of Nashville and its vicinity.
Enclosed I forward to you by this mail, one private letter, and a communication from M Worthington, in all seven pieces. I rejoice that we have the promise of M Worthington that the misunderstanding which has heretofore existed at St Augustine is at an end.
<pb#325 />
Yesterday evening two Indians arrived at this place bringing the enclosed communications" consisting of three pieces, from Doyle,"
Ne-a-moth-la, and Tus-ta-muck-e, and one from the Mulatto King and two other chiefs. From indisposition I have been unable to attend to this subject to day, but will endeavour to despatch it tomorrow. After having a consultation with Judge Brackenridge, I
have resolved to send a Talk * to the Chiefs in reply to their letters.
which will be delivered to the runners tomorrow, and a copy transmitted to you by the next mail. The purport of this talk will be, to fix their confidence in what you have told them, and to disregard the mischievous interference of meddling people; and at the same time admonishing them to be careful not to mistake the meaning of your words, which they have in writing. I have considered this hint in some measure necessary, from my suspecting that they are disposed to construe the question put by you as to the place where they would like to be concentrated, as a promise that any place would be given to them they should think proper to choose. I shall inform them that in your absence, the Government of this Province is entrusted to me and that of E. Florida, to M' Worthington, and that we are both instructed to repeat your words to the Red people.
I am at a loss to understand the meaning of the proposed Talks of Mr Worthington and do not know the exact authority under which he acts, unless it be by immediate instructions from the President, which could hardly be the case, as such instructions would only come thro, you. For myself I do not believe that I possess any powers similar to those M. Worthington is about to exercise as ex officio Indian Agent. If he act under your instructions, it does not appear to me there is any thing like authority for holding “splendid Indian Talks”—According to my understanding of your instructions he is merely to make known to the Indians the Talk which you gave to the Chiefs who visited you at this place, leaving it to themselves to assemble in Council, and send to you the result of their deliberations.
The Indians appear to be a good deal agitated and embarrassed. I
will advise them however to attend only to your orders. It appears that M*Intosh has been stirring up mischief and I fear is the principal cause of the uneasiness that prevails amongst those people.
Col. Fenwick informs me that Capt" Bell is under arrest & will not be tried before the 25" of this month.

1* The old Government House, Garden & Lot were put into the possession of the Acting Governor on the 13" ult.
2" The House adjacent thereto demoninated the “Council Room,”
is the same identical building with the “National School,” & is now occupied by Capt. Bell's Company. I have directed the acting Q Masters to hire quarters for this company, there being no tents at the station, & as soon as he has procured a building, the “Council Room” shall be turned over to the acting Governor.
3" The House & Lot occupied as a Hospital shall be vacated by the Military so soon as a suitable shelter can be procured for the sick.
4" The building & lot known by the name of the Custom-House.
On this lot there are in fact two distinct Houses; both of which were formerly in the occupation of the “Contador”.—In the Inventory they are called the “Treasury & Custom House”.—The latter is already in the possession of the Collector. M. Rodman. The first floor of the former is occupied by the Office & Store of the Ass' Commissary &
is Richard J. Easter.

Under the distribution to the military department in your communication, number 3" “The building adjacent to the Monastery a few steps south,” is the same building number 4 denominated the “Flour Store,” & is now occupied by Capt.

The malignant fever, which has prevailed here, has destroyed nearly all the mechanicks, & the soldiery has also suffered very severely;
which circumstances alone have prevented my carrying this arrangement into operation before this period. I trust that the Quarter Master General's Department will immediately be instructed to remit funds sufficient to accomplish these objects.

<docbody>To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, the Petition of the Undersigned, citizens of West Florida, respectfully represents:
That your Petitioners humbly apprehend there is no object more essential to social welfare and to the maintenance and preservation of civil liberty than a due regard to public Education; and accordingly your Honorable Body has on all occasions, manifested a munificent patronage to matters of that nature-
Your Petitioners farther represent to your Honorable Body, that the peculiar properties of their City of Pensacola, its central location in relation to the southern and Western sections of the United States, the salubrity of its climate, and the amenity of its situation, render it singularly suited to such purposes; and that the advantages already recapitulated are not a little enhanced by those of a scite for the construction of the necessary edifices, in the neighborhood of the City.
Your Petitioners farther represent that the scite aforesaid, commonly known by the denomination of the “old English Fort” is the property of the United States; that it is an eminence or more properly a chain of Hills, rising about half a mile in the rear of the present limits of the City to the North, and running thence back from the city in a direction comprehending the intermediate points from North to West; that the scite aforesaid as your Petitioners humbly conceive, *See post, p. 311. 1° House Journal, 17 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 182, 197,300.
<pb#329 />
will be of no utility to the Government for any national purposes;
that it is extremely sterile and no wise valuable but for its elevation and amenity—
Your Petitioners therefore, in order that the scite aforesaid may be secured for the purposes aforesaid, so nearly connected with the public welfare, humbly pray that your Honorable Body will pass an Act, granting for the purposes aforesaid to the City of Pensacola, an hundred Acres of the Land aforesaid, to be located by the Cabildo or City Council—And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray &c.

[Enclosure:DS "]
Memorial to Congress by Spanish Citizens of West Florida
[December 29, 1821]
To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, the unanimous Memorial of the Ancient Spanish Citizens of West Florida, respectfully represents:
That a Petition as your Memorialists are advised, was presented to your Honorable Body at some period of its last session, from certain Persons within the State of Alabama,” praying that an Act might pass to annex this Territory of West Florida to that State; a subject the expediency of which is likely to be agitated in your Honorable Body during the present session; and your Memorialists are moreover apprized by an editorial article in one of the public Journals of that State, that a Petition having the same object in view has already gone forth also, from this territory signed by about Two hundred of its inhabitants; a disclosure which has not failed to fill them with surprise, because the publicity which is usual and proper on such occasions was never given to the petition aforesaid; because it has never received the approbation or concurrence of your Memorialists;
and because there is even reason to believe that some, and probably not a few, of the Petitioners aforesaid, are not, nor ever were, as they therein profess to be, inhabitants of this Territory.
Your memorialists farther represent unto your Honorable Body that notwithstanding the natural and honest partiality which binds a colonial settlement to the Parent State; and the mild and fostering rule which the Mother Country even amid its greatest intestine embarrassments, has ever exercised at least over this province; and the seasonable return of constitutional liberty which had so recently dawned on all the wide-spread dominions of the Spanish Monarchy, re-opening to their view a long futurity of promise; they yet acquiesce with cheerful resignation in the motives of public policy and of State, which sundering forever their ancient connexions, have united their destinies with those of the north American Confederacy; and if they repine not at those events, it is because their confidence is implicit in the liberal, and enlightened, and moderate, and paternal principles of its institutions—
Among these your Memorialists are advised that the right of Petition is distinctly recognised and guaranteed, and they are therefore induced to introduce themselves on this occasion, to the notice of your Honorable Body; that the right of self-government is funda-
<pb#333 />
mentally respected, and they therefore venture to declare themselves to your Honorable Body on the subject of the proposed union with Alabama—
Your Memorialists humbly conceive, that by the annexation of the Floridas to the territory of the Union, and the establishment therein of the constitution and Laws of the United States, the necessities which prompted the acquisition from Spain, through the medium of the treaty, are substantially appeased; that no such necessity can be urged to exist for the proposed subjugation of West Florida to Alabama; that it is a measure essentially deficient, both in its nature and consequences, in an equitable reciprocity of right and interest; and as such wholly unwelcome to your Memorialists—
Your Memoralists humbly represent to your Honorable Body that their country is peculiar in almost every of its features; in its climate, its soil, its population, its resources, and its occupations; that they are deeply convinced of the value and force of that principle or Spirit of Laws, so eloquently inculcated by the distinguished writer on the subject, that all legislative provisions, whether municipal or political must have relation to national circumstances and local peculiarities;
that this relation is found in the civil and municipal regulations now existing, and which have so long existed within this territory;
and that if any sudden and abrupt revolution in the laws and arrangements of a society whose concerns and institutions are already complicated and extensive, can be productive of other than mischief and disorder, your Memorialists are not satisfied that the requisite remedy and relief is to be found, in the present constitution and code, or is likely to be supplied, by the legislature, of Alabama; in which the voice of your Memorialists must be necessarily too feeble to be heard—
Your Memorialists farther represent to your Honorable Body, that the proposed union with Alabama, is a measure of permanent duration; that it is one in which all their future prospects and dearest interests are involved; one for the precipitation of which as they humbly conceive, no good or sufficient reason can be assigned; and that it is therefore one which it is clearly desirable and expedient in the estimation of your memorialists to suspend for farther and more mature deliberation and in order that it may hereafter be accomplished, if it shall prove eventually eligible, upon such terms and in such manner as may best suit the great interests which are involved, and attain the great objects which are proposed.
For these among other reasons, your Memorialists humbly pray that an Act to attach the territory of West Florida to the State of Alabama may not be passed by your Honorable Body; but that your Honorable Body will proceed with such dispatch as the exigencies of the subject and of the occasion require, and such as may comport
<pb#334 />
with your wisdom and convenience, to appoint for them a separate government upon the principles heretofore received and pursued by your Honorable Body on similar occasions; allowing them as usual a territorial legislature; and providing for them a Governor of established Justice and moderation—And your Memorialists as in duty bound will ever pray &c.

DEAR SIR, In complyance with their request I take the liberty of enclosing to your Exccellency the within recommendation of the Court, the bar and the city council of Pensacola, in favour of H. M. Brackenridge Esq as United States' Judge for West Florida. In addition to what is contained in the beforementioned recommendation, I can only add, that while the gratification of Judge Brackenride's wishes in this subjeet respect would add much to the respectability of the United States courts in West Florida, it would, at the same time afford him an opportunity of adding to his literary acquirements which might not only be advantageous to himself, but highly important and useful to the community.
The recommendation in favour of Judge Brackenridge, is unanimous as relates to the County court. Two of the Aldermen, and one or two of the bar, being absent their names could not be procured.
There is no contrariety of opinion here, as to the propriety and expediency of the appointment.”
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your Eccellency's most obedient, humble Servant, D. SHANNON.

Recommendation of Henry M. Brackenridge as Judge
[December 26, 1821]
TO HIS ECCELLENCY JAMES MONROE, President of the United States—
We the undersigned, members of the Escambia Court and bar, and of the city Council of Pensacola, understanding that Judge Fromentine, intends leaving this place, having been appointed President of the
<pb#338 />
College at New Orleans, would beg leave to recommend Henry M.
Brackinridge Esqr, as a suitable person to fill the office of United States Judge at this place.—From the known character and standing of Judge Brackinridge, it would be useless to make any representations as to his qualifications, further than to observe that his knowledge of the Civil and maritime laws, and of the French and Spanish languages, render him in the opinion of the undersigned peculiarly well qualified for the said office. His appointment, it is believed, would give general satisfaction.

<place-time>r [December 31, 1821]</place-time>
<docbody>At an adjourned meeting of the City Council of Pensacola on Saturday the 29, day of December 1821, The following memorial was presented to the board, and unanimously adopted, to wit:
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, The memorial of the city council of the city of Pensacola, respectfully represents—That they are encouraged to solicit from the justice and liberality of your Honorable body, the same benefits which have been freely extended under similar circumstances, to cities within the acquired territories of the United States. Few cities possessing the
<pb#339 />
important commercial advantages of Pensacola, and with such prospects of future consequence, are so totally destitute of permanent funds, for the support of their city government, or for the erection of publick edifices of the most necessary kinds. The real property once owned by this city, together with a considerable portion even of the publick square, during the troubles of the Spanish monarchy, were disposed of, and the moneys appropriated to defray the expences of the Spanish Colonial government, leaving the city, without even a market house, prison, hospital, or a single edifice of any kind, or a spot of ground whereon to build, excepting a part of the publick square.
That under the Spanish dominion the provincial and city governments were inseparably connected, and the publick buildings and property, served the purposes of boath; but the separation which has taken place has necessarily produced a state of things entirely different: That this property, if sold by the United States, will not produce any great amount; but if granted to the uses of the city, will contribute greatly to its prosperity.
Your memorialists further represent, that doubts may exist whither the ground in front of the city, covered by water in ordinary tides, extending from low water mark to the depth of ten feet, although not the subject of grant to any individuals, properly lies within the controul and jurisdiction of the City, or whether the right of property therein belongs to the United States: That it would greatly tend to the health and prosperity of this city, that the ground before described, should be declared exclusively under the controul of the said city, in order that such improvements may be made thereon, as may be required by its commerce, without injury to the health, or occasioning publick invenience, as would be the case, if the water privileges were monopolized by a few individuals—
Your memorialists therefore respectfully pray that the publick property within the limits of the city of Pensacola, as is disignated by the ordinance of Gen Jackson, incorporating the same, and a narrow strip of land adjoining thereto, bounded by Col. Kings survey; including the sites of Forts St. Phillips and St. Michaels,” well calculated from their high and healthy situation for a college, and not exceeding one hundred acres together with the ground in front of the city, from low water mark to the depth of ten feet, be granted to the city council for the use and benefit of said city of Pensacola—and your memorialists will ever pray &c
<pb#340 />
Whereupon the following resolution was adopted to wit: Resolved that the foregoing memorial be transmitted without delay to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States of America.

<source>[NA:HF, 17 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[Referred December 31, 1821]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled—
Your memorialists, inhabitants of West Florida beg leave to represent; that the period is now drawing near when the wisdom of Congress will be called into action, in legislating for the Government of the Floridas: it is a duty we owe to ourselves and to our Government to contribute to the general welfare; but more especially to that Section of Country where we are situated and with the interests of which we are best acquainted. The acquisition of the Floridas has added to the United States an extent of Sea Coast of near Twelve [MS. torn]
within which is embraced one of the finest Harbours [MS. torn]
Country; and numerous others of less importance: These [MS. torn]
not surrounded in the immediate vicinity with a rich and fertile
[MS. torn] connected with the outlets of important Rivers, which water a rich and flourishing Country;—
Your Memorialists look forward to a period when Pensacola from its natural advantages, will not only be the place of deposit for the wealth of a Country, destined by nature to be tributary thereto; but by the assistance of art, in opening internal communications, may yet be a Store House for the riches of the South and West—
Your Memorialists entertaining these sentiments as to the importance of Pensacola naturally inquire to what Section of Country are their interests nearest allied? Is it to East Florida? or is it to the Country in their rear, to wit, the State of Alabama, to which they must look for support? The Geographical position of West Florida is as inviting, in favor of an annexation to the State of Alabama [MS. torn] repug-
<pb#341 />
nant or forbiding that East and West Florida should be incorporated into the Union as one State. Between the Floridas theire never can be a comm [MS. torn] of interest; nor can these Territories, with convenience, be controuled or managed under one Government. East Florida is as large or larger than either of five States now forming a part of the Union: and will the State of Alabama be too large with West Florida annexed thereto?
Your Memorialists unhesitatingly declare that it is their solemn belief, that it is for the Political, Civil and Commercial interest and prosperity of West Florida to be annexed to the State of Alabama;
and to make known more fully this sentiment, we have caused these presents to be forwarded to your Honourable body; requesting that Congress will seriously reflect, consult and deliberate and find that it will be in their wisdom to grant to your memorialists their request.
But should the unfortunate course be adopted, that of incorporating the Floridas into the Union as one State, it is the devout wish of your memorialists, that untill the time, this may happen, the Floridas may
[MS. torn] as two distinct and seperate Territories—All which is respectfully submited and for which your Memorialists will ever pray J. B Cumming Philip Patrick Samuel Adams Sam' A.

You will observe that in that relating to the seizure of the papers at S*Augustine, he dwells with much earnestness on the agreement which had been made between Colonel Butler and the late Governor Coppenger concerning those papers—If that agreement was known to you at the time when you issued the order for demanding and securing the papers, will you have the goodness to state the particular grounds, on which you judged it necessary to resort to compulsory measures for obtaining possession of them *

<pb#348 />
ready to communicate fully with him and shew him every thing in my possession respecting Indian affairs as I had done to Captain Bell into whose hands I placed all General Jacksons communications to me on that head–Capt Bell left here on the 23"ult" for Washington in company with Judge DuVal The Indian affairs remain pretty much as they were, when I last wrote to the Department of War and my opinion is unchanged, that they ought to be sent up amongst the Creeks *-
If I were to let my partiality for this Province prevail over my opinion for the general good, I should say an Indian agency in Florida would be beneficial to us—But I should only say so from Territoriallyinterested motives—The General Government are abler and wiser on this subject than I can pretend to be—I shall cheerfully acquiese in whatever course they may recommend-
It is the fate of politicians, therefore not improbable that in the reorganization of the Florida Administration, I may have become functus officio—Whether that may happen, or I may be continued here or elsewhere—I take leave to obtrude on you as one of the Cabinet a short remark—That in the selection of Officers for this country, it requires in the most special manner, men of inflexible honesty, fearless and incorruptible-Not linked in and prejudiced and compromitted in the speculations, particularly landed &" of either the old or new inhabitants of the Province—So far as I can possitively understand, you have been thus far fortunate in your choices and feel confident you will continue to be so—But the subject requires, rather an increase than a diminution of vigilance—I know it is one of the most delicate and hazardous movements in life to give advice, particularly to persons in high stations, without being thought impertinent or pragmatical—But I trust, you will not subject me to any such unworthy imputation, when I assure you it proceeds, from the most abstract sense of duty—I leave my own destiny in the hands

<docbody>SIR—The emigration to this Province does not prove so abundant as might have been expected—The Spaniards will mostly leave it, for various considerations—This is a trait in their national character, an invincible disinclination to amalgamate with or become a part of a foreign nation: and would have happened sooner or later under any administration, under any system of things, provided the Spanish Sovereignty in the Province was not suffered to prevail—The Spanish Government have used pains to induce them to emigrate to the Island of Cuba & they have availed themselves of facilities offered and advantages held out to them—I had no right to countervail their inclinations, except by acting with justice & uprightness in the administration of the affairs of this Province agreeably to my best judgment & the orders given me—Hoping, that the superiority of the American mode of Government & its honest & plain character would induce them to prefer it—
<pb#350 />
There are three or four hundred Minorcans " & their descendants who will remain, they are a good, quiet, industrious people—The remainder of this population will be American, French &c—
I sent the enclosed Communication to the Mayor & the new Council
& they will send on to Congress a memorial to have the gift of the Public Property for the use of this Territory—
I wish it to be distinctly understood by the Government, that if in the reorganization of the Administration for the Floridas, it shall be deemed better either in a Territorial or National point of view that I
should be superseded or left out—that all personal considerations in my favor, shall be waived—Conscious of having done my duty here &
that I have the approbation of the Government & the American nation so far as my humble services, call for their notice-
Yet, if I could be transferred, from this Province to some fit employ at home or abroad, I should feel the highest obligations for such a continued mark of distinction—I have as yet, bought not a foot of land here—& therefore have no local predilections—There is one remark I will beg leave, to be excused for making, to you as one of the Cabinet—That in the selection of all officers for the Floridas, men of the strictest & most inflexible honesty should be chosen—Men, firm &
decided, fearless of all consequences in discharging the duties of their stations—and above all, not connected with, linked in & tainted with the land claims & speculations either of the old or new inhabitants of the Province—I have no favourite to recommend nor adversary to oppose & I hope I may be better provided for, than continue here-
Therefore nothing but a sacred sense of Duty Could have induced me to hazzard the imputation of obtrusiveness in offering these observations—
If the Floridas be consolidated, this will in time become an important Southern Slave-holding state-producing as it's staples, Cotton, sugar rice & fruit—But I fear the whole of it, with the exception of small & dry islands directly on the sea coast, will ever be unhealthy for white people emigrating from High, & healthy lattitudes"—

In the mean time I have thought it advisable to reorganize the board of Aldermen, the old ones having resigned; and shall continue under the present mode 'till a more congenial and perfect one be pointed out by the highest authorities.
On the commencement of this new year permit me to felicitate you and our brother Floridians on the return of health to this City; which under the divine disposer of all things, I hope may never again be so awefully assailed as in the past season—I seriously and solemnly invite all your energies and care to an immediate efficient police, which I most conscientiously believe to be absolutely necessary to guard us against the certain recurrence, with the warm weather, of another attack of the Malignant Fever—
I would also invite your attention immediately to the subject of forwarding a memorial to Congress praying a grant of such of the public lots and property in and about this City as the General Government may not require for public purposes to be given to the use and behoof of this Territory, except what may have been used and occupied in common by the Inhabitants—
It is necessary to observe that the Officer Commanding the U.S.
Troops on this station informed me personally some 10 or 12 days ago that he had received orders from the Secretary at War, to deliver over to the Acting Governor of this Province, under the opinion of the Prisedent expressed on that subject, 1" the Government House, Lot and Premises—2" the Council Chamber—3" the Hospital in the center of the City to be evacuated, and some other property as specified in the order from the Department of War, as soon as that could be conveniently done—I have no doubt there will be no unnecessary delay-Of which property, so soon as it shall be at my disposition, I
<pb#352 />
shall recommend your occupying the old Council Chamber again for the discharge of your duties—'till then you will continue to rent some cheap and convenient room to sit in as heretofore—
I was put in possession of the Government House before the aforesaid order came on, under the opinion of General Jackson on that head I have been obliged to expend my private funds to put it into even habitable repair, which expenditures will be properly vouched and I shall claim their reimbursement—
Your estimate of the 10th Dec of $5,000 with all the papers respecting the Taxes &c. have been forwarded to the Department of State, and the determination on all which, as soon as it shall reach me, will be communicated to you—
Gentlemen. With full confidence that you will do every thing in your power for the good and prosperity of this City and its dependencies, and an assurance that I will frankly and firmly cooperate with you, I pray the blessing of providence on your labours—

The Memorial of the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of St Augustine Respectfully Sheweth;
That the City of S*Augustine has suffer'd in an unusual degree in Common with other Towns, in the United States from the visitation of malignant fever during the last year; Whatever may be the opinions entertain’d by Medical Professor's, concerning it's origin, whether from importation, or from local causes, it is by your Memorialists believed by all; that Cleanliness in the Streets, the removal of nuisances, fit receptacles for the sick, the Constant employment of Hospital Physicians & sufficient attendance of Nurses, tend to mitigate the severity, if not entirely to prevent the Occurrence of Endemial diseases;
Your Memorialists, regret, being under the necessity of disclosing the fact, that the Ordinary revenue of the City, is not at present, nor can it be expected, that for some years to Come, it will be adequate to effect these important objects, & they therefore look forward with trembling anxiety to the approaching Season, when they may be again visited with disease; in a state as unprepared to resist its ravages.

<place-time>NASHVILLE January 22°, 1822</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Your letter of the 1" Instant," reached me a few days since, in which you advise me of the receipt of mine of the 22" of November, with its enclosures. I had also the honor to receive a copy of your communication, dated 2* of November, to the Minister of Spain,”
1? Answered post p. 368.
13 Printed also in A. S. P., For. Rels., IV, 793–796, and in S. Doc. 86, 17 Cong.

1* To Don Joaquin de Anduaga, NA (SD, Notes to Foreign Legations, Vol. 8, p. 29), printed, A. S. P., op. cit., pp. 787-788.
<pb#355 />
together with the translations of two letters from said minister, addressed to the Secretary of State, and transmitted to me by direction of the President of the United States." You inform me, that the definitive answer to these letters will be deferred, until you shall have the opportunity of obtaining my reply, with any remarks I may be disposed to make on the communications of the Minister of Spain.
I sincerely regret, that Don Joaquin de Anduaga's letter of the 22"
of November, had not been transmitted at an earlier period, as it will be necessary in my reply, to refer you to the two communications of Cap" Bell, of the 31* of July” and 4" of August last,” and to M*
Worthington's letters on the subject of the archives at St Augustine; "
the first of which, are on file in the Executive Office at Pensacola, and the last I had forwarded to you when I was informed by Doct. Bronough, that my resignation was accepted on the first ult; not expecting to have any further use for them. Immediately on the receipt of your letter, however, I wrote M* Worthington, requesting him to forward you certified copies of his communications, as promptly as practicable, and have adopted the same measure in relation to those of Capt. Bell, altho' I had been advised that he had transmitted duplicates to you from St Augustine. To these documents I must refer you, relying upon my answers thereto, and my own recollection for their contents, and accompanying my reply with such vouchers as are within my reach; believing that there will be ample testimony in your possession, to enable you to rebut the slanderous statement, and expose the unblushing falsehoods of this insolent and indecorous Minister of the Spanish Government.
Upon the subject of seizing the papers at St Augustine, you observe, that the Spanish Minister dwells with much earnestness on the agreement which had been made between Colo. Butler and the late Governor Coppinger, concerning these papers; and request to be informed, whether this agreement was known to me, at the time the order was issued for demanding and securing them; and if so, to state the particular grounds on which I judged it necessary to resort to compulsory measures for obtaining possession of them.
In answer to this enquiry, I have the honor respectfully to state, that Co" Butler, the commissioner appointed to receive the transfer of East Florida from the Spanish Government, reached me on the 8"
of August last, at Pensacola, and made his report.” As soon as it was submitted to my examination, I was entirely satisfied, that neither
<pb#356 />
Coppinger on the one hand, nor Butler on the other, had any authority, either under the treaty or their instructions, to enter into such an agreement relative to the Archives, which were, by a positive stipulation between the two Governments, to have been delivered over with the country, to the constituted authorities of the United States. The Treaty was imperative, and vested the parties with no discretion upon the subject. Believing, however, that the course adopted by Co! Butler, was perhaps, the only one that could have been pursued, without the employment of force, to preserve the documents; and notwithstanding I was perfectly satisfied, that Coppinger had, on his part, violated both the Treaty and the order of the Captain General of Cuba, yet I felt disposed to leave the Archives precisely in the same situation in which Co.' Butler placed them under his agreement with Coppinger. I was induced to take this course from a wish to create no unnecessary difficulties, and from a hope, that the Spanish Officers would comply with their arrangement, and permit the papers to remain unmolested, until the arrival of the President's instructions in regard to their final disposition. From the treachery and duplicity which I had discovered to be practised by the Officers of Spain, I
frankly confess, that my hopes on this occasion, were not very strong and flattering.
This insolent minister states, that the commissioners, Butler and Coppinger, stipulated, that the Artillery and Archives were to remain, the first in deposit in possession of the Anglo-American commissary, and the last where they were; and without the possibility of their being taken away to the Havanna. He does not say what was their situation; but it will be recollected, that the Alcalde was their keeper.
Nor does he tell you, that Don Jose Coppinger, permitted them to be picked and culled, and taken away, in violation of his solemn pledge and agreement, as you will see, by a referrence being had to Capt.
Bell's letters to me, of the 31* of July, and 4” of August 1821, duplicates of which, I am advised, are in your possession.
When I received these letters from Capt. Bell, who exercised provisionally the powers and authorities of Secretary of East Florida, before the arrival of M Worthington, I acknowledge, that my indignation at Spanish treachery and perfidy was very much aroused. I
felt that it was my imperative duty to protect the people of Florida in the enjoyment of the rights secured to them expressly, under the Treaty. I was bound to act on the occasion. The agreement respecting the Archives, although void ab initio, for the want of power, had been outrageously violated by Coppinger, or with his connivance, and the evidence of individual rights secured to the citizens, about to be fraudulently conveyed away, after he had pledged himself to Co.'
Butler, that they should “not be removed from that place, and should remain precisely as they were.”
<pb#357 />
The verbal report of Co" Butler, as communicated in my letter of the 4” of August last,” affords us a clue to the motives of Co'Coppinger in attempting to practice this base deception. For the last six months previous to the transfer of the country, it is believed, he had been engaged in issuing surreptitious grants for large quantities of land in East Florida. It became necessary, that they should be taken to the Island of Cuba, for the purpose of consummating the titles. These were no doubt the documents which were picked and culled from the ballance, to be transported to the Havanna; as Coppinger was convinced that the fraud would be inevitably detected, if they should be surrendered to the American Authorities. This explains thereason why and wherefore they were not delivered over to our Commissioner in the first instance, and forms the basis of the confidential communication made to Co" Butler on the 3° of July last advising him that a large portion of those Archives, relating to private property, were packed up for removal to Cuba, and which gave rise to his letter to Co'Coppinger of that date as will appear by the enclosed extract marked E.”
Speaking of the correspondence between Co." Butler and Coppinger, Don Joaquin de Anduaga remarks; that “By the before mentioned correspondence it appears, that doubts had arisen whether the Artillery and certain Archives ought, or ought not to be delivered over to the United States.” With due deference, I would ask, could any doubts exist as to the Archives under the 2* Article of the Treaty? No.
Could any doubts be entertained relative to the Archives embraced in the instructions of his Catholic Majesty, or the instructions given by the Captain General of Cuba, to Don Jose Coppinger,” Colonel, and commanding the Spanish forces at St Augustine, and who was charged with the delivery of the country and all documents relating to the property and sovereignty of the country ceded? It is presumed not. In his letter to Co.' Forbes, of the 18" of May 1821, the Captain General of Cuba says:—“Respecting East Florida, where there ought to be found all her Archives, Governor Mahy would direct that Governor, as entrusted by him with the important commission, to make a formal delivery to M. Forbes of that province, as well as of the documents belonging to it. A similar dispatch would be addressed to the commandant of West Florida.” * Here is a positive declaration, that such instructions were, or should be given to Governor Coppinger, for
<pb#358 />
the delivery of all the Archives included in the stipulations of the Treaty. Contrast this statement of the Captain General of Cuba, with the answer of Governor Coppinger to Co.' Butler's letter to him, dated July 3* 1821.” “Confining myself” he says “to a compliance with the Treaty, and the orders of my Government, (which he informed Co! Butler verbally, prevented him from delivering the Archives)
their literal sense is the only guide to my endeavour in the execution, and when any doubts arise, I consult them with that frankness necessary to ascertain my course, and warrant my responsibility.” From this exposition, no one can fail to discover a striking contradiction between the Captain General Mahy and Governor Coppinger; the former assuring Co.' Forbes, that he would direct Governor Coppinger to deliver over the documents to the American authorities, and the latter asserting, “that as an individual, he believed they should be given over” See E E * but that the orders of his Government prevented him from performing that duty. One or the other has stated a positive falsehood; for which, the Spanish Government, it is conceived, should be required to inflict signal punishment on the aggressor, both as a violator of his orders, and of the provisions of the Treaty, solemly entered into and ratified by the two nations. We can find no excuse, either for the Captain General, Governor Coppinger, or Co'Callava, for not complying with the orders of their superiors, and with good faith carrying into effect the 2* Article of the Treaty, by delivering, and being prepared to deliver over all the Archives and documents appertaining to the property and sovereignty of the Floridas. Instead of this; the Captain General does not deliver them at Cuba;
Coppinger, contrary to his orders, was preparing to convey them away, in a clandestine manner, in violation of his agreement and solemn pledges, until arrested in his faithless conduct by Co" Butler; and Callava, whilst professing to surrender all the Archives, &" was wickedly and treacherously attempting to carry away the testamentary papers of the heirs of Vidal, and other documents, which were the evidences of claims to private property in the country ceded to the United States.
The unjustifiable delays and evasions of the Officers of Spain, in witholding the Archives and documents, of which the delivery had been expressly stipulated by Treaty; vouchers indispensable to the United States for the dispensation of private justice, and the establishment of private right, but entirely useless to Spain, could not but impress upon me the belief, that they were intended to subserve the purposes of injustice, fraud and oppression. The attempt to carry away a number of those documents, from St Augustine and Pensacola in a clandestine manner, was considered as a flagrant
<pb#359 />
violation of the Treaty, and I began to entertain the opinion, that a systematic combination had been formed amongst the Officers of Spain to deprive the honest citizens of the country of all the evidences of their right to property, secured to them by the provisions of the cession.
Under these impressions, and believing myself vested with legal authority to protect the rights of the citizen, I was urged by the most imperative duty to exercise it in their behalf. Upon the receipt of Capt. Bell's letters, before referred to, advising me that the Archives at St Augustine were picked and culled, to be conveyed away, I
forthwith wrote him on the 1* of September, 1821,” the letter herewith enclosed, marked C, of which the following is an extract:—
“I have this moment received your several letters of the 31* of July and the 4” of August, with their enclosures, and regret that the shortness of time will not permit me to answer in detail. On the subject of the Archives, I will barely draw your attention to the second Article of the Treaty with Spain, according to which, all Archives or documents, directly relating to the property or sovereignty of the country, are to be delivered by her. You will, therefore, forthwith on the receipt of this, if not already in possession of them, take them into your possession, and place them in the hands of the Alcalde for sake keeping; and who ought to be like every other, a sworn officer under the Government, and not a Spanish Officer, owing no allegiance to the United States. All papers and documents in the possession of the Cabildo, and of course in the possession of American and not Spanish functionaries, are to be retained, and none of them permitted to be culled and taken away.
“I am gratified with the friendly expressions of the Cabildo of St Augustine, but am sorry to find they have so entirely mistaken the sense of the Proclamation. Nothing could be more absurd, than that Spanish Officers as such, should administer the Government.
The true meaning is, that whenever the Incumbent will take the oath to support the constitution of the United States and adjure that of Spain, and take the oath of Office, he shall be continued therein; the part of the Proclamation which enjoins fidelity to the Government of the United States, would otherwise be nonsense, and the Governor has at all times the power to remove or dismiss him, and supply his place. But this will not be done, unless it be found that he is incompetent to his trust, or unfaithful; and whenever either is the case, this power for the benefit of the People, ought to be exercised.”
Having previously addressed Capt. Bell a letter on the 13" of August 1821,” a copy of which is enclosed, marked D, and forwarded
<pb#360 />
it to him by M Bird, Attorney for the United States in East Florida, I was gratified to find from his answer, that before the receipt of either of my communications, himself and M Worthington had taken the steps necessary to preserve the Archives, and extend to the People of East Florida that protection, which was secured and guaranteed to them under the Treaty. This will fully appear by referrence to the communications of M. Worthington, all of which I have heretofore transmitted to you-
When it is recollected that the Archives and documents relating to the property and sovereignty of the Floridas were to be transferred with the country, agreeably to the stipulations of the Treaty, and that Governor Coppinger had been ordered to deliver those in East Florida;
what indignation must fill every honest and honorable breast, when we learn from the letter of the keeper of these papers at St Augustine, that he claims them as private property, which he had acquired by purchase! From whom could this purchase have been made? From the King? No; because he had stipulated to surrender them with the country to the American authorities. If bought at all, it must have been effected with the Executive Magistrate of the Province. In either event, it must have originated in the grossest corruption, and was rendered null and void by the Treaty between Spain and the United States. Such, however, is the reason assigned, why this subaltern Spanish officer disobeys his King, and his superiors, with an insolent Spanish Minister to justify him in his villany, and at the same time charging your Agent, who has in every particular, executed the Treaty in good faith, with atrocious crimes committed against the honor of his King and nation. Although Don Joaquin de Anduaga has taken occasion to heap upon me the most illiberal and indecorous epithets, he is challenged to substantiate a single instance, in which myself or those acting under me, have not scrupulously executed every Article of the Treaty with Spain. There is no foundation, then, upon which to rest the criminal charges of this rude and insolent Minister, save in his own brain; in the falsehood stated by Co" Jose Coppinger, in his ridiculous appeal to the American People, and in his Protest, to which, it seems he testified with his oath.
It appears, that the Minister of Spain considers his sovereign as having been insulted in the most scandalous manner, in the person of his Commissary, Co'Coppinger. At the time the seizure of the papers was effected, he insists that Co'Coppinger was entitled to all the privileges and immunities of a public Officer of Spain, in consequence of his being recognised as such, in doing and transacting business with Capt Bell. The fact was, that Capt. Bell was not vested with any diplomatic or commissarial powers, and any such recognition on his part, was as ineffectual as it was without authority. This position is so truly ridiculous, as scarcely to deserve a comment: By turning to
<pb#361 />
the act of cession executed by Co' Butler and Jose Coppinger, it will be distinctly seen, that neither of those persons retained any powers as commissioners, after the date of that instrument: If this was the case, it must be equally evident that neither Capt. Bell nor Mr Worthington could have possessed such powers at the period to which the Spanish Minister has alluded. Co' Jose Coppinger being the Commander in chief and Governor ex officio over East Florida, he was charged under the Treaty, with the delivery of the Country, and the withdrawal of the Spanish Troops. The moment these duties were performed, both his and Co' Butler's powers as Commissioners ceased. This event took place on the 10" of July 1821,” when the Spanish Authorities ceased the exercise of their functions, as is demonstrated by the following extract from the act of cession:—
“There has been verified, at four O’clock of the evening of this day, the complete and personal delivery of the fortifications, and all else of this aforesaid province, to the Commissioner, Officers and Troops of the United States, and, in consequence thereof, having embarked for the Havanna, the Military and Civil Officers and Spanish Troops in the American transports provided for this purpose; the Spanish Authorities having this moment ceased the exercise of their functions, and those appointed by the American Government having begun theirs,” &c.
The Surrender of the Provinces had been completed, and the occasion which created Commissioners ceased to exist. The authority and Troops of Spain were withdrawn, and the United States in entire and rightful possession of the country. The six months had also transpired, within which the Treaty provided the transfer of sovereignty should be made, as well as the evacuation of all the Spanish Officers within the Floridas. Co. Coppinger remaining after the occurrence of these events, could no longer be considered as entitled to the privileges and immunities of a public Agent. He could only be viewed as a stranger permitted to reside in the Floridas-, “amenable to the common judicial tribunals, but who, conformable to the Spanish laws, existing before the cession of the Province, would have been liable to removal from it, or to imprisonment at the discretion of the Governor, for the mere act of being there.”
These disclosures, I hope, will exempt me from the criminal charge, which Don Joaquin de Anduaga has preferred against me of having trampled upon the laws of Nations, and the law of every civilized country. If the detection of treachery and prevention of fraud; the security of the rights of the citizen, and a scrupulous adherence to the articles of the Treaty, which both Governments were sacredly bound to fulfil, are to be considered atrocities, I have to observe, that I
<pb#362 />
glory in the charge, and give this further assurance, that is the course which I shall always pursue. I would enquire of this Minister, whether the law of nations protects the agents of Spain in the open violation of the Treaty, the rights of individuals, and the orders of their Government? Does this law sanction the noncompliance with the most solemn engagements, by which the rights of individuals were to be sacrificed, by depriving them of those evidences of property, stipulated to be delivered over with the country ceded? If so, then is every treaty a perfect mockery, and the law of nations becomes the authority for every species of fraud and corruption. Coppinger and Callava might not only have furtively carried away all the Archives of the country, but also the negroes or moveable property, and their agency would have secured them from merited punishment! Doctrines leading to such absurd and dangerous results, deserve the contempt and indignation of every honest and intelligent individual in the country. -
To the remark of the Spanish Minister, “that the more my conduct is considered, the more evident it is that by it my sole object has been to insult Spain;” I have to observe in reply, that it is as insolent as it is unjust. I again challenge Don Joaquin de Anduaga to establish the fact necessary to authorise such a conclusion. If I know myself, I can declare with the utmost confidence, that I have never entertained any thing like national antipathies, and that my conduct, on no occasion, has ever been influenced by such base and unmanly considerations. All the measures of my administration, whilst Governor of the Floridas, were founded upon the principles of justice; the object of which was to secure to the United States and the people who were citizens of the ceded provinces, those rights which were guaranteed to them under the cession, and which the faithless officers of Spain had wantonly violated in contravention of the Treaty, the positive orders of their superiors, and their own solemn pledges and engagements! Such corrupt agents as these, who wore the insignia of Office, as well as the badge of dignity and honor, excited my disgust and abhorrence; and the Minister of Spain would do well to purge the Officers of his own Government, before he is permitted to allege criminal charges against those of the United States. The virtuous and honorable Spaniard claims the same share of my respect and confidence, as the citizens belonging to any other nation. I rejoice in the regeneration of Old Spain, and in the independence of the American colonies, and hope that both may free themselves from that misrule and oppression with which they have been cursed for centuries past, under former Governments.
The indecorous language used throughout the letters of the Minister of Spain, and the foul charges therein contained in relation to myself, cannot but be viewed as the grossest insult to my Government, to
<pb#363 />
the American People, and to the Officer whom he has endeavored to cover with odium and disgrace. It is derogatory to that comity and decorum which should always characterise diplomatic communications, and which are essential to the harmony and friendly intercourse of Nations. In reply, I confidently trust, that the President of the United States will take such a stand, as shall secure the respect, due from foreign Ministers to his exalted station, to the Officers of the Government, and to the nation over which he presides.
It is a subject of remark, that I have been the object of Spanish calumny and virulent animadversion ever since the transactions of the Seminole War. This spirit of hostility is to be discovered in the observation of Governor Mahy to Co.' Forbes, in the letter of the latter to the Secretary of State, of the 28th of May 1821;” in the protests of Colonels Coppinger and Callava, and has pervaded all the diplomatic communications of Spanish Ministers subsequent to the period to which I have alluded. Although such a course is insulting to myself, to the Executive and to the American People, I have never deemed it of sufficient importance to induce me to complain. Feeling a confidence in having always discharged my duty, whilst in the service of my country, I disregarded the abuse and vituperation of Spanish Agents, from a belief that my Government would vindicate its honor and dignity. This I flatter myself will yet be accomplished in due time. The considerable portion of my life has been devoted to the happiness, honor and glory of my country, and where my conduct has met the approbation of the Government, I have a right to expect that it will resist any attempt to slander my reputation. Notwithstanding I solicit the most free and unrestrained investigation into all the measures of my public life, by those to whom I am responsible, it is conceived, that the same latitude should not be granted to the ministers of foreign powers.
Such an interference is rude and indecorous, and should be resented on all proper occasions. This, it is believed, is not due to me alone, but to the President and the Nation.”

HERMITAGE January 21* 1822.
SIR, On receiving the correspondence between Colo: Forbes and the Capt General of Cuba I find a promise on the part of the latter, that; the Governor of East Florida would be ordered to deliver over the Archives to the American Authorities, and this duty not having been performed I consider it proper to advise you that in the month of June last Colo: Coppinger late Governor of East Florida stated to me in a conference had on the Subject of the delivery of the Archives relating to individual property, that as an individual he believed they should be given over to the United States, but that his orders prevented him from turning them over—I mentioned to him that I
had heard a report as a reason for not turning them over, that it would be the interest of the United States to destroy them, and remarked that I regarded not the source from whence it came as it could alone spring from the most wicked and unprincipled heart–As there appears an absence of good faith in the execution of the late Treaty I give you this information, for the benefit of the Government—
I have the honor to be, Very respectfully; Y" M* Ob. St.

<place-time>WASHINGTON CITY Jany 25* 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I had the honor to command the detachment of of the United States troops on the 10" of July 1821, the day on which an exchange
<pb#365 />
of flags took place at S*Augustine the Capital of East Florida, under the late treaty with Spain *—On the day following, I was by commission from General Jackson Governor of the Floridas, vested with all the powers of the late Spanish Governor, Coppinger, which commission I received thro’ the hands of the American commissioner, Colonel Butler, with other documents and instructions for my government in the discharge of the duties of provisional secretary of the province until the arrival of M* Worthington, who had been duly appointed by the President of the United States; Col. Butler the commissioner shortly after set out for Pensacola—Among the documents left by him for my government & information were extracts of the official correspondence between the two commissioners on the subject of the Archeives & documents relating to individual property & the inhabitants of the province—by which it was agreed that they were not to be removed from S*Augustine, but to remain precisely as they were until the doubts arising on the part of the Spanish commissioner should by reference to the Spanish Authorities on his part and to the American Authorities at Washington on the part of the American commissioner be settled.—No inventory of the archives, documents & papers was ever made to my knowledge, none was delivered to me by Col. Butler—
After his departure a number of the inhabitants waited on me to know the situation in which the archives & documents relative property &
rights in the province had been left by the American commissioner and if he had obtained possession of them—on being informed that they were said to be in the possession of the Escribano, a spanish notary & officer, until the doubts arising as to the delivery of them, should be settled by the respective Spanish & American Authorities—
they appeared greatly dissatisfied, expressed themselves in a manner
& in terms which led me to believe they had no confidence in the spanish Officers, and finding no inventory had been made of the archives, declared from their knowledge of the manner in which those documents were filed, there was no security that the whole of the documents would ever be delivered—that important papers might be sent to the Havanna, if not already sent, that others might be placed on the files—in fact that the door was open to almost every species of fraud in the office by which individuals rights would be violated and the public lands be granted away without the possibility of detection-
They strongly advised me for the above reasons to take possession of them—this I informed them I was not authorized to do, that things must remain as they were until I received further instructions—Boxes were already made in which these documents were to have packed, to be sent to the Havanna, but they were in the public store and under my charge—A Spanished Armed Schooner sailed sometime after the transports with the troops, for the Havanna as also did another
<pb#366 />
vessel which carried the Treasurer of the Province, it was said many boxes supposed to contain documents were taken by this Officer—
The whole of the Archive or bureau of the City Engineer which contained important documents relating to individual rights in the city, public squares & vacant lands was removed or not found—At the time of taking possession of the documents & papers found in the offices of the late Gov. Coppinger & Escribano, there was a vessel almost ready to sail for the Havanna, boxes were ready in the governors house in which the documents found in his office were to have been placed, this I believe he admits in his Protest. Altho' the papers have been seized, a sufficient examination has not been had to determine if all are there which were expected to be found—I frequently heard the persons appointed to examine them say that they did not find in the governors office those papers which are usually kept in his office—Whether any were removed after the 23” June which were embraced in the correspondence, I am not able to say, I have no reason to believe there were, altho' the inhabitants interested were constantly complaining of the situation in which they were left, and were paying great fees to the officer, to obtain evidences of their papers being in the office—I must further state that the Notary Don Juan de Entralgo had declined to take the oath of allegeaince to our government—that Govr Coppinger was respectfully applied to by me to deliver up the papers peaceably, before any resort was had to force, and when the papers were put into the hands of certain persons appointed to examine them with diretions to separate private papers from documents relating to the province Gov' Coppinger was given to understand that he or any agent on his behalf might attend the examination—As far as the examination has proceeded, many papers have been separated from the public documents, put into boxes, and reported to M' Worthington for the purpose of being returned—By the citizens having property and residing within the Province, the conduct of the American officers in taking the papers was generally approved of.
Most respectfully, I am, Sir, Your ob" Ser'

<place-time>PENSACOLA Jan' 28–1822.</place-time>
<docbody>MY DEAR GENERAL. I do myself the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12* of December,” and I assure you it was not without great mortification I found that from the unaccountable irregularity of the mail, so few of my letters had reached you, for I
have not suffered but one mail to pass without writing. Within the last two or three weeks the arrival and departure of the mail has been several times changed at this place, so that there is no calculating with any certainty upon it.
Nothing of any consequence has occurred since my last. The enclosed copy of a letter addressed by me to Col: Crowell,” will shew that the uneasiness of the Indians still continues. I have not yet heard from Nea-moth-la and the Chiefs to whom I addressed a talk some time ago, and begin to be somewhat apprehensive that an accident may have happened to the runners by whom it was sent.
The Spanish Officers * are still in confinement, and I am sorry to say that this circumstance has had a tendency to keep up the disatisfaction of the Spanish inhabitants, when I thought the leniency of the course adopted would have disarmed them, but it does not appear practicable to satisfy them, and I therefore look upon their displeasure with indifference.
Fromentin has been veering and turning about, of late, like a weathercock. Instead of going to New Orleans, he had determined to go on to Washington in the Hornet, it is now said that he is going to stay, after having given up his house, and shipped off his furniture to New Orleans.” It is said he is about to organize his Court at last, * Enclosed in a letter of Mar. 8, 1822, from Jackson to the Secretary of State.
<pb#368 />
and in imitation of Judge Duval, deliver a charge to a Grand Jury.
He is too contemptible to deserve any notice.
In my last I informed you that an attempt was made to go into a re-hearing of the case of Innerarity: a “Bill of Review,” as it was called was presented to me, and was received in the manner you will discover from the enclosed copy of my decree.” It was to be expected that he would die hard, but die he must, and it only remains for the Sheriff to do his duty, perhaps the task would more properly belong to the hangman.
Gen' Gaines arrived here a few days ago, and is about to sail for St Marks—The Officers of the Engineer Corps have not yet left this place. A very splendid entertainment was given by Capt" Henley on board the Hornet, and the Citizens are about to give him one in return this evening at Austin's.
I fondly anticipate the pleasure of seeing my much valued friend Easter here in a few days—Present my best respects to M"Jackson
& Miss Hays—and also to Mess Donaldson " & Rutledge.”
Irenew my dear General the assurances of my unalterable devotion to you.

<place-time>[Referred January 28, 1822]</place-time>
<docbody>Memorial of the Citizens and Inhabitants of East Florida—To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.—
Your memorialists hail with exultation and gratitude that they have at last been permitted to participate in some of the high privileges and advantages secured to them under the Constitution of the Union.
But they regret that ever since the 10" of last July when this Province was ceded to the United States * their condition has been from the Treasury (NA, SD, Misc. Lets.). He was paid his salary as Judge for the period May 18, 1821–June 1, 1822 in the sum of $1,557.53 (NA, GAO, Fifth Auditor's Repts., No. 2., p. 234).
<pb#369 />
Very unenviable—They have borne with this State of things because they were confident it would be of a very temporary and short duration—
In this remark it is not intended to reflect either on the wisdom of our Government at Washington or on the Officers who have been appointed to this Country—It is taken for granted that every thing was intended for the best.—They only wish to be disenthralled from the anomalous and uncongenial situation, to which they have been consigned.
They think they may in a great measure be releived, by Congress advancing them to the second grade of our Territorial Governments in the same manner as such Governments are accustomed to be advanced and organized under the Laws of the United States.
They confidently trust that Congress will see the justice and necessity of the Florida's being organized under one Territorial Government with the power of having Executive, Legislative and Judiciary Officers of that Territory.
Your memorialists are aware that neither St. Augustine, nor Pensacola are so situated as to afford ease and convenience to the Inhabitants of the Floridas to assemble at, in their Legislative Capacity.
But there can be no impropriety in confiding to the Governor or to special Commissioners the power, forthwith, to select some more central point.
It is well known if we judge from American Enterprize, it is no objection that there be not at this moment a City built in the heart of the Floridas—When the permanent or temporary Metropolis shall be once designated, then, before thier labor & industry the Desert will blossom as the Rose and the still and houseless plain, as by the Genius of Magic, become the Crowded City of business and Learning—
Your Memorialists do most seriously recommend the consolidation of the Two Provinces, as of vital importance not only to themselves but to the Union.—
Reposing in the Wisdom and Integrity of Congress, they submit this most important Petition to their serious consideration, trusting they will afford not only the relief specifically prayed, but extend them, such further aid and asisstance as in their virtue and foresight they may deem liberal and just.—
Signed—

DEAR SIR, Your letter of date the 31* of December * last (Postmarked the 9" of this present month at the City of Washington), acknowledging the receipt of my resignation as Governor of the Floridas forwarded by Doctor Bronough, has reached and advises me, that the same has been accepted by you.
To be freed from the toil and labour of a Public Office, is what I
have long desired, and what indeed, the state of my health and other causes rendered necessary: But as it appears that there is none of my public life but what must be traversed by Congress, and having long since requested M*Adams to lay before you the correspondence with Judge Fromentin, from a wish that it might have been submitted to Congress if thought necessary; I did confidently hope, that before the acceptance of my resignation, this correspondence would have been produced, and that with the investigation of all and every part of my conduct, my enemies might have had no grounds to charge me with resigning through fear of impeachment, as M* Whitman and some other members have illiberally and untruly insinuated on the floor of Congress on the 2" Inst.," when supporting his resolution for a
<pb#371 />
call for those papers: I therefore sincerely regret that those papers were not laid before Congress agreeably to my request, and before the call made by Mr Whitman.
The moment I saw the Intelligencer of the 2" Instant, I wrote you to suspend the acceptance of my resignation," until this investigation was complete—Not having at that time any intimation of either its receipt or acceptance, from you or the Secretary of State, and fully believing, that if you found Congress had a wish to investigate my conduct, you would have witheld its acceptance under circumstances which were disagreeable to me, and at least, until there was opportunity of meeting the attempts which are made, to stamp my conduct with unworthiness and dishonor.
I addressed a note also to the Speaker of the House of Representatives,” stating these facts to him, and requesting him to communicate them to that Body, with assurance on my part, that I was ready and willing to meet and plead generally to any charges that might be brought against me.
My wishes and hopes not having been realised, but the acceptance of my resignation having been forwarded by you, seven days after M"
Whitman's resolution calling for the papers had been passed, leaves but one course for me to pursue, and that is, such course as I may deem, justice, to myself, and the American nation, may require under all circumstances.
I have to repeat the request made to the Secretary of State, that my accounts be closed by the Department, information given to what time my Postage and Stationary accounts ought to be made up to, and to whom the ballance of the funds in my hands are to be turned over, and what directions hereafter are to be given to the Public letters addressed to me from the Floridas I make you a tender of my thanks, for the very flattering manner of approbation, which you have been pleased to express of all my Public acts, and services; and the friendly expressions of solicitude for my individual health and happiness, I sincerely reciprocate I am, Dr Sir y Mo Obt Servant ANDREW JACKSON

<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate & House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled—
The Memorial of John W. Simonton" of the Island of Cayo Huesso or Key West in the province of East Florida Merchant and his Associates, beg leave respectfully to inform your Honourable Body that they have purchased and formed a considerable Settlement on said Island which is situated in North Latitude 24°27 and Longitude 82° West of Greenwich immediately on the Edge of the Florida Stream about 75 Miles due North from the Havana and quite contiguous to most of the out ports on the North Side of Cuba where the greatest proportion of those piratical Boats which have so infested this coast have been fitted out—it affords a Harbour large and commodious perfectly easy of access and quite Safe for Wessels of any Size also an abundance of Fresh Water and Wood—We humbly conceive an Establishment at this Island would be of great importance to Governm" as well as to the Merchants of the United States 1* As a Rendevous for our Wessels of War it being one of the most commanding places on the Florida coast for the protection of that very large proportion of American Commerce carried on thro the Gulf of Mexico—It would also be one of the most convenient places for Wessels to touch at bound to or from the Atlantic States thro’ said Gulf in case of Distress which too frequently happens when they have no other resource than a port in the Island of Cuba where they are obliged to incur very heavy expenses—2"—It is the only eligible situation for a Depot for Wrecked property it being within four Miles of the Florida Reef where so many Wessels of all Nations are driven on shore and about half way between Cape Florida and the Dry Tortugas—We are at this time wholy dependant on the wreck[ers] of New Providence for the protection of our property in case of shipwreck and when that occurs the property is carried to New Providence which affords a living to more than Five hundred persons employs fifty or Sixty Wessels, produces a large Revenue to that Government and is of great pecuniary advantage to the Merchants of that place—
<pb#373 />
Indepenant of the advantages already enumerated the Salt ponds of this Island are numerous and extensive and it is supposed by competent Judges that Salt enough may be made for a large portion of the supply required by the United States—They your Memorialists would also beg permission to state that they have already incurred considerable expense in building and making other improvements and are at this time erecting a Tower or fortification forty feet square to be built of stone at the entrance of said Harbour for the protection of such property as may be sent there which will in all probability be completed in the course of three months—They also request permission to state that a number of respectable Merchants and others from different parts of the United States are making arrangements to establish themselves on said Island that from its contiguity to the West Indies and particularly the ports on the North Side of Cuba and the great facilities afforded by its local position to Smuggling they apprehend that all the precaution which your Memorialists can use will be insufficient to prevent much illicit Commerce—Your Memorialists notwithstanding the appearance of prematureness deem the reasons above mentioned sufficient to justify them in praying your Honourable Bodies to make Key West a port of Entry—And your Memorialists will every pray"—

<place-time>Executive Department East Florida, ST AUGUSTINE Feb. 1* 1822–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR—I enclose you a Register of the officers in this Province, since my assuming, the duties of the station, to which the President & Genl.
Jackson appointed me-
I also enclose an account of W* Reynolds,” whom, I found here on my arrival employed as private Secretary, to the Officer commissioned by General Jackson, to administer the affairs of this Government, till
<pb#374 />
I should reach this place. As I was appointed Acting Governor, virtually, and was convinced that, it was impossible for me without employing a person to copy & translate papers for me, to organize the temporary Government & carry on the double correspondence which I deemed necessary, with the different Heads of the State & War Departments at Washington & with the Captain General at Pensacola, I continued Mr Reynolds; * But told him candidly, that I was not authorised or empowered to appoint or employ a Private Secretary, that if he chose to continue in that situation under me, he must run the risk of receiving any compensation from the Government of the United States as I, could make no agreement or guarantee on the subject—He said it was not so much the pecuniary compensation, as the benefit which might result to him, in being continued that made him anxious on the subject—it might have the effect of bringing him into public view & be introductory to something profitable
& permanent-
Under all views, I thought it best to continue him all the month past—And should liked to have still kept him in office—But as the duties of my situation since I have, within a few days discontinued writing Pensacola; & this Government being organized; leaves me, perhaps, with a little assistance, sufficient time to discharge all the duties which devolve on me, without employing, formally a private Secretary, I have requested Mr Reynolds, to wind up his office, and he has enclosed me this account Marked A.—I have made a few observations in the account itself—A view to public economy has induced me to take this step—and until ex{MS. torn] authorized to fill it, shall
[MS. torn] leave the office of private Secretary, vacant.

forward you every thing which has transpired on the subject, since I entered on my duties here—All these papers, with the exception of N° 19.” I forwarded as the transactions arose, both to you at Pensacola and to M' Adams N° 19.—Was in the press when the President's Message came out—I then doubted the propriety of publishing it—But sent a copy of it to the Honb" C. A. Rodney and the Honb" Dr Jo" Kent at Washington, to let it be published or not as it might be thought best—I presume they did not think it worth while—I now send it to you as my honest opinion on the whole affair—
I assure you I am sorry, that my proceedings here should have rendered it necessary for you to have any trouble about them—But I cannot conceive, that a justification from the American Authorities for taking possession of the Archives, can be called for, now, otherwise than as a mere matter of form—
To hear of your ill health, gives me pain, for your well being is dear not only to your personal friends but to the “Hearts of your Country”—
If you think a Winter residence in East Florida, on the Atlantic—
so convenient to our great sea port Cities, would be agreeable to you—I will, on being so commissioned by you, look out for and purchase an eligible place, of the size you may require—I fear your winter-mountain-air is too keen for any person subject to breast complaints—
I have endeavoured, thus far to carry through your Floridian system and have succeeded—In the reorganization of this Government, I don’t know what they will do with me, and as I am not informed, that my conduct has been approved of, I wrote the Gov" that I laid no claims on them, for the part I had acted here—If they thought it best in a Territorial or national point of view to discontinue or not advance me, or to send me elsewhere, to act, regardless of any personal considerations towards me—to look at me in the Abstract—I hold not one foot of land here and have no predilections—
<pb#386 />
However should I be continued in Florida, I shall always feel it an honor and a high satisfaction, to tender you any humble services which you may at any time, think it in my power to offer—
With very great respect &c W. G. D. WORTHINGTON

<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled The Memorial of the undersigned citizens of S’ Augustine and the county of St Johns in Territory of Florida respectfully sheweth That your Memorialists labor under great inconvenience from the mail route from the North as at present established.—They humbly represent that it is not only unnesessarily circuitous, but in consequence of the mail being carried by water the greater part of the way from S' Mary's to S*Augustine, it is in boisterous weather and during the prevalence of low tides, subject to detention and exposed to the danger of being lost.—They beg leave to represent, that, if the route were changed and the Mail carried by the way of Jefferson and Coleraine near Camp Pinckney in the State of Georgia and by way of the Cowford * in this Territory a distance of more than forty miles would be saved, the arrival of the mail would be much expedited, and a direct mail communication opened between this Territory and the State of Georgia to the incalculable advantage of both.—The route proposed by your Memorialists will pass on what is generally known by the name of “Kings road”" which was laid out at a great expence and is still in a Tolerable state of repair, and was always the direct line of communication between Florida and Georgia, when both were united under the Government of Great Britain.—Your Memorialists humbly apprehend that a bare inspection of the Map of Georgia will furnish sufficient arguments in support of the prayer of your Memorialists.

Your Memorialists therefore pray that an Act may be passed changing the Mail route as proposed—And your Memorialists as in duty bound will ever pray &c G. W. Perpall Jn” Drysdale F. M.

S. in Florida was passed, I have the honor to state, that the Committee on Naval Affairs was induced to recommend the passing of the said act in consequence of the following information, which they received from the best authority—“That on the 23rd. ultimo, when Judge Duval crossed the St. Johns River there were at least three hundred hands employed in cutting down the live oak & red cedar on the Publick lands; that the establishment made by these workmen & their employers, was near a small town called Pablo, on the St. Johns River, about four miles from the mouth, and that they extended their depradations for thirty miles up the river. The Committee were also informed that the course of transportation of the Timber thus cut, was by an inland communication from the St. Johns River to the St. Marys, and down the St Johns and that a vessel despatched to the mouth of the St. Johns River, would probably effect the object in view.
I have the honor to be Sir with great respect your obedient Servant L. M'LANE.

have not been able to obtain any information, sufficiently precise to specify the Parties and arrest them—It, is mainly an important object to watch over and protect the property of the United States in this Province in respect to their Live Oak, Cedar, and Pine so necessary in ship building, and of which such peculiarly fine growths, characterize the Floridas I have been informed that a Brig, from New York, has been for some weeks up the S" Johns, near Judge Fatio's, loading with Timber, ultimately destined for England—Has she complied with the Revenue Laws?—It is said no timber has as yet been carried out of this Province and will not be for a month or more—However—you will without further delay, for more minute information, either go yourself or send an honest and intelligent Deputy on the S" John's, to look into and ascertain the facts in the premises-And also keep a strict look-out, as far as is practicable, on this subject, from Cape Sable to our Northern Boundaries so that the property and interest of the United States receive no detriment, particularly as it regards their Timber—
And in every instance, where either you or your deputies, can find out either persons of Vessels engaged in these unlawful Trespasses (to call them by no [MS. torn] seize [MS. torn] attach every person & those ncer The with them, and secure them, ’till they may properly be CO —And as we have at present no Court of the United States

<place-time>Executive Department East Florida STAUGUSTINE March 18th 1822</place-time>
<docbody>SIR—I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 22" Ulto.
by last mail *—For this additional mark of, approbation of my humble services here, by the President, in continuing me as the Governor of this Province, since the resignation of Gen' Jackson, I return my grateful acknowledgments—I view it as another strong proof of the inflexible integrity of our Government, which being convinced of the honest intentions of it's public functionaries, however distant or subaltern they may be, will not suffer them to be injured either by Foreign or Domestic Clamor whether proceeding from a Palace or a Cottage—Whenever it shall be the intention of the Government, to send a successor to me here, I will with the greatest comity, transfer to him every thing which can possibly be expected from me and in the best state and condition in my power—'Till then, I will, as heretofore, endeavour to discharge whatever Duties may be devolved upon me—
I have been anxiously seeking to obtain all the information on this Province which I thought would be useful But it is even yet so submerged in water, that I did not like to risk travelling through it—
I should have to sleep out and be exposed to the worst of weather—
Besides I have no orders to that effect, and therefore might not be reimbursed the expences which I should incur—If however this Government will authorise it I will, if [MS. torn] the Hot weather sets in, make a tour either around, through or into the Floridas, with a small select party—I wished to ascertain a fit place for a future Metropolis And suspect, either about the Head of Tampa Bay or a few miles north of the Alachua Savanna, will be the best scite—
However this can be better ascertained hereafter—
The Alachua is one of the best bodies of good land—I suppose not less than half a million of acres—and near Tampa is good land also-
It is said that M Chazotte has discovered near Cape Florida about
<pb#402 />
4,000,000 acres of good land—I suspect that his account is exaggerated—I don’t say intentionally—But it is so—
I wrote you shortly after my arrival here that I would take up the subject of the English wreckers lining our Southern Coast—These are the facts—
From Cape Florida to the Dry Tortugas they frequent and encumber this Coast—There are, at this time from 37 to 40—from 16
to 18 Tons, employed—Their general rendezvous is at Key Taverno near Key Largo—There are also 8 or 9 fishing smacks, Americans under Spanish licence from 38 to 40 Tons employed off Cape Sable—
They take a fish called the Grouper of from 3 to 18 lbs—worth at the Havanna from a Dollar to a Dollar and a half a piece—in seven or eight days each smack makes a trip and sells her Fish at from Three to four Hundred Dollars—This trade continues all the year—
Also the business of taking quantities of the finest Turtles is carried on by the English from New Providence & I think the Wrecking, the Turtleing, and Fishing should be put on a footing to ensure a monopoly or first preference to our own citizens—
Altho' it would perhaps be most proper to write [M.S. torn] it will be brought forward, by being known to you—I would observe, that there is an island, about Seven miles long and two broad to the south-west of Cape Sable; which would furnish a fine Military Post as a Point D'apui to our whole Military Atlantic Line—good water and a good Harbour—and it has upwards of One hundred acres of low land where salt is deposited in abundance—So that from the duties derived from Wrecking & Salt &c—some hundreds of thousands of Dollars would flow into the Treasury from Cape Florida to the Dry Tortugas—
There is one thing as it regards Florida I wish the Government to keep always in mind—That whenever they have seen Americans slyly or furiously advocating Spanish Grants and Spanish Claims and vindicating Spanish Officers at the expense of their own fellow Citizens—To beware of them—I don’t say “Hic Niger est, hunc tu Romano Caveto” But beware of them.
This Island is called by the Spaniards Cayo Hueso—The English is, Bone Key—The Americans call it Key West—or pronounce it, so—I shrewdly suspect it belongs to the United States—It is claim’d, to have been bought by a M. Strong * a lawyer here, and a few days ago I learnt he has sold it to Gen' Geddes” or Governor Geddes as
28 John B. Strong.
<pb#403 />
he is called, of South Carolina—He is the same Gentleman whose certificate &c is seen in the affair we had here with Co'Coppinger the ex-Spanish Governor, on the taking possession of the Archives
&c—He lived while here with Co'Coppinger—I know nothing about him, the Sec” at War of course and the South Carolinians know him, except, he appeared to be a gentlemanly personage in my slight intercourse with him—It is a fine Military and Revenue Position I repeat again; and if it belongs to the United States, they ought to have it, as they ought to have all the lands here which fairly belong to them—Which depends much on the Land commissioners—They
[MS. torn] of the first integrity, talents and inflexibility and fearless of all [MS. torn]—After having submitted the [MS. torn] Mr. Marshall Forbes of the 16" Inst, to M Rodman the collector of the Customs—
I have only to lay it before you—It is an important subject and if strong grounds are not taken, it will be attempted to be carried on boldly and extensively—My Order of the 1* Ins" to Marshall Forbes”
which I inclosed to you on the 6" " I thought bold enough—But he no doubt judiciously declined seizing the persons and things as I
thereby directed—The Collector also, tells me that he had given orders to his deputy a Mr Jenkins whom he sent to the S" Johns to take the clearance there—I told him to send on and counteract the order and make him come here with the Brig—I don’t know if he will be in time—Perhaps the Secretary of the Treasury has given orders on this subject—M Rodman will do his duty—
I have taken some important movements with our Judiciary here—
I will be able to write you on that subject by next mail—If we differ in opinions we sincerely compromise *—
With high consideration &c W. G. D. WORTHINGTON.—
Secretary and Acting Governor of East Florida THE HON” JoHN Q. ADAMS Secy of State Washington City P. S. If I thought the good opinion of the Gen' Gov' towards me, required that I should get memorials in my favor, even for Governor of the Floridas, I could get them, of the Best portion of the Community here—From men who have inherited or sworn to support the Constitution of the U States: But I charged my friends, not to get any such signatures in my favor—to get none—much less of men who have cast off heretofore, their allegiance to the U States, or of those who [MS. torn]

James G. Forbes to Acting Governor Worthington (East Florida)
St AUGUSTINE 16* March 1822–
SIR. In pursuance of the directions you gave me for the protection of the timber of the U. S.” I proceeded to S' John's River on the 9" ins" but the boisterous weather prevented me from crossing before Tuesday last when I ascertained that an Hermaphrodite Brig was loading with Cedar at 9 mile Point near Cedar Creek by a M*
Smith of New York said to be for London that she will in about ten days be ready for Sea after taking in the proceeds of 63 Trees near Black Creek bought from a M. Cowan * lately dead which were cut from the best accounts on Lands of the U.S.
The master can be required to come here for clearance when such measures can be taken as will best protect the public interest & as will naturally suggest themselves to you-
In order to obtain correct information upon this subject it became necessary to ascend a very fine River west of S* John’s called Black Creek about ten miles but which is navigable for vessels of any burthen entering the latter for 15 miles—I saw a M. Brannen employed by Mr Smith to draw the cedar to the landing which renders the evidence very clear—
I shall continue my researches to discover any intruders upon public Lands & report *—
I am with great respect, Sir, Your most Obedient and Very humble Servant J. G. FORBES Marshal for the Floridas TO HIS EXCELLENCY W. G. D. WORTHINGTON Governor of East Florida

<place-time>Duplicate: U. S. Schooner Shark" Port Rodgers Thompsons Island Triplicate taken out March 28th 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In obedience to your order of the 7" of Februy,” I proceeded to this Island for the purpose of carrying into execution your instructions, and in consequence of boisterous weather on our outward passage by which we lost two of our Spars, I was compell'd to Stop a few Hours at Havanna for the object of replaceing them, this course was however by no means out of our route, and it fortunately afforded me an opportunity of takeing under convoy five American vessels, a list of which is herewith enclosed.—
In reguard to the Island in question I have the honour to report, that after carefully examining its whole extent, Sounding the Harbour, and otherwise makeing such observations as your instructions directed, I have come to the conclusion that it possesses many advantages, as a Naval Rendezvous, and in consequence, have in the name of the U. States taken formal possession of it, giveing it the name of Thompsons Island” * and have left Mids" Joseph Morehead and one man to retain possession until further assistance can be furnished them—at present their situation is tolerably comfortable. In selecting this name, I have not only gratified my own wishes, but
<pb#406 />
have complied with the request of the proprietors of the Soil present on the Occasion of planting the Standard—and whose names are John Warner Esq. U. S. Commercial Agent at Havanna, and Mess”
Fleming" & Whitehead * all American Citizens.—
The western end of the Island is the only part that can be approached by anything larger than a Boat At this extreme the Harbour is formed by a part of Thompsons Island and several mangrove
& sand Keys many of which are covered at High water—
The Harbour to which I have given the name of Port Rodgers” "
is capacious and sheltered from the prevailing Northerly and Easterly Winds, it is however open from the South to West which is a matter of but little importance as the winds in this part of the world but Seldom blow from the Southwestern quarter, The Depth of water in the Harbour is from 3 to 5% Fathm" but Wessels may find Safe anchorage without going into less than 4 fathoms—The Tides are rapid and thier rise and fall about 6 Feet, wood and water is abundant, the latter not of the best quality Fish and Game are to be taken in the greatest profusion, and in the course of a Year or two the Proprietors of the Island, will be able to Supply Ships with Fruit and Vegetables.—
The watering place is two miles from the anchorage ground, situated on the South Side of the Island, The well about 100 Yards from the Beach, the Landing is at present inconvenient but will become less so, Should the Island be resorted to by our Cruisers, as the Officers will naturally for their own accommodation, add to the facilities of Shipping the Water—
I have already enlarged the Wells, and enclosed one with a Fence, clear'd a large Garden Spot, planted Stakes on a Mud Bank, that partly obstructs the channel into the Harbour and otherwise employed the period of my stay at the Island in makeing such improvements as will benefit those who may hereafter visit the port—
It may well be supposed that on a coast so peculiarly dangerous as the Florida Keys. the difficulties of Navigation must be very numerous—requireing on the part of the Navigator the utmost caution to avoid the innumerable Shoals, Rocks, and Sand Banks that surround him in every direction, and altho' these dangers, are laid down with admirable accuracy by the English Surveyors, yet the Tides and currents are so rapid and irregular, that untill proper and
44 John W. C. Fleming, a merchant of Mobile, Ala.
<pb#407 />
Skillful Pilots are establish'd, it would be imprudent for our large Vessels to cross the Reef—In time of War however these very dangers will prove of Service to our Cruisers as a Knowledge of the Navigation will enable them to pass and Re-pass the Reef without danger, and the want of Such Knowledge will prevent the Enemy from reaping the same benefit In regard to the advantages of Thompsons Island, as a place of Trade I feel at a loss in forming an opinion its location is most certainly in its Favour, being Situated about midway between florida, and Cuba, The Southern States and Louisianna which circumstance has induced many to believe that in the course of time, The Island must become a place of considerable commerce—Heretofore the Florida Keys have been the resort of smuglers New providence wreckers, and in fact of a Set of desperadoes who have paid but little regard to either Law or Honesty, the present establishment tho' on a Small Scale will I conjecture, (with the assistance of the Settlers) be enabled to keep these lawless people from this Island—
but I would suggest the necessity of an early augmentation—of force—if it be only for the purpose of enforceing the Revenue Laws—
A Gun Boat would be a force sufficient to answer all the purposes required.—
In enumerating the advantages possessed by this Island and its contiguous waters, and in reccommending it as a situation well calculated for a Naval Rendezvous, I have looked to a period when our country shall be engaged in a war with Some great Maritime State—and when the undisputed possession of the Florida Keys will be a matter of great importance, as it will insure the undisturbed Navigation of the North West side of the Florida Stream (or Gulf of Florida) to our Merchant Wessels, and will prove a check, on the vast resources of the Island of Cuba—vast indeed, if possessed by the enterpriseing Government of Great Britain.—
I may be excused in takeing this opportunity of Suggesting through you Sir, to the Hon" Scy of the Treasury the great want of Light-
Houses on the Florida Keys—The happy transfer of so fair a portion of Territory to the U. States has led to the belief that under the enlightened and liberal policy of our Government, the Navigation of the Shores of Florida will be rehé rendered more safe and convenient, Numberless are the Wessels, and lives, that have been lost on this treacherous Coast, so common are Ship wrecks in in this neighbourhood, that many Vessels are employed Solely for the purpose of rescueing property from destruction, of which they receive a very large Share as Salvage"—
<pb#408 />
That rapid current denominated the Gulf Stream Sweeps the Florida Reef, with incredible velocity, changing its course at every variation of the wind thereby baffling the Skill of the most experienced Navigator, and as they are deprived of the common Beacons, so necessary in the Navigation of an intricate coast so are they at all times exposed to the most eminint danger— —
The great number of vessels that daily pass through the Gulf of Florida, to & from the Ports of New Orleans, Pensacola Mobile, the Ports of Cuba, Jamaica and the Spanish Maine renders the erection of Light Houses, not only as an act of justice on the part of our Government, But humanity and a regard to the Safety of the lives and fortunes of our citizens Seriously demand so desierable a measure—
I should feel diffident in thus intruding my opinions upon you Sir were I not fully impress'd with the belief that the Subject requires the prompt and serious consideration of Government.—
At present Vessels bound into the Gulf of Mexico & Mexican Sea, are compell'd to make the Island of Cuba for the purpose of Shapeing a correct course to clear the dry Tortugas—(The Southern extreme of the Florida Reef) by approaching Cuba they expose themselves to the depredations of the numerous Picaroons, that infest the neighbourhood of that Island—But if Light Houses were erected on the Florida Keys—Wessels in passing and Re-passing through the Gulf might Keep on Soundings, the whole distance and indeed might find safe Navigation inside the Reef-
As to the number and location of the Light Houses I should presume there ought to be four, one on each extreme of the Florida Reef, the other two at intermediate spaces—Say one on Cape Florida, another on Key Largo and the third on Sand Key (if Sufficiently Stable) and the fourth on the South west Tortugas—A Light House is also very much wanted on cape Canaveral—

<place-time>WASHINGTON April 1. 1822</place-time>
<docbody>SIR/Intimately connected with the correct examination and decision, of the claims to land in Florida, is a proclamation of the King of Spain alledged to have been issued, in 1786, requiring British subjects who were allowed a reasonable time, by the treaty of 1783
between England and Spain, to dispose of there lands and effects within the provinces of East and West Florida, to make such disposition within a limited time. It is beleived that the time first fixed was extended by subsequent proclamations.
It is also beleived, that many of the British subjects having failed to comply, with the requisitions of the Treaty and proclamations, applied to their government for indemnity, for the loss of their lands
& that commissioners were appointed, in consequence of those applications, who awarded to the claimants what was considered a compensation for the lands supposed to be forfeited, for a failure to comply with the terms prescribed, in the proclamations of the King of Spain.
Not only a very large portion of American citizens deriving their claims to land from Spain & the U. States are interested, in procuring authentic copies of those proclamations and the proceedings of the
<pb#420 />
commissioners supposed to be appointed by the British government;
but our government is also interested to a very large amount, in ascertaining the extent of our national domain. The object of the present application is to solicit, that you will have the goodness to obtain, through our ministers at London & Madrid, authentic copies of the documents referred to, in this communication.”

<place-time>[April 5, 1822]</place-time>
<docbody>To the House of Representatives of the U. States:
I communicate herewith to the House, a Report from the Secretary of War" containing the information requested by their Resolution of the 5th Ulto 10
It may be proper further to add that the Secretaries of both the territories have occasionally required and received the aid of the military force of the U. States stationed within them, respectively, to carry into effect the acts of their authority. '
The government of East and West Florida was, under the Spanish dominion, almost exclusively military, the governors of both were military officers, and united in their own persons the chief authority both civil and military.
The principle upon which the act of Congress of the last session providing for the temporary government of the newly ceded provinces, was carred into execution, has been communicated to Congress in my message at the opening of the session." It was to leave the authorities of the country, as they were found existing at the time of the cession to be exercised until the meeting of Congress, when it was known that the introduction of a system, more congenial to our own institutions, would be one of the earliest and most important subjects of their deliberations. From this, among other obvious considerations, military officers were appointed to take possession of both provinces; But as the military command of General Jackson was to cease on the 1* of June; General Gaines the officer next in command then here who was first designated to take possession of East Florida, received from me a verbal direction to give such effect to any requisition from the Governor for military aid to enforce his authority, as the circumstances might require. It was not forseen that the command in both the provinces would before further legislation by Congress on that subject devolve upon the Secretaries of the territories, but, had it been foreseen, the same direction would have been given as applicable to them.
No authority has been given to either of the Secretaries to issue commands to that portion of the Army which is in Florida; and whenever the aid of the military has been required by them it has been by
<pb#423 />
written requisitions to the officers commanding the troops who have yielded compliance thereto, doubtless under the directions received from General Gaines, as understood by him to be authorized.
Shortly before the meeting of Congress, a letter was received at the War Department from Col” Brooke, the officer commanding at Pensacola, requesting instructions how far he was to consider these requisitions as authoritative; but the assurance that a new organization of the Government was immediately to be authorized by Congress was a motive for superseding any specific decision upon the inquiry.

<docbody>HON JOHN Q. ADAMS Secty of State SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22” Feby last * confirming the Authority vested in me by the commission of Gen' Jackson, and instructing me to discharge from Confinement Marcos de Villers and Arnaldo Guillemard, which instructions have been complied with promptly & with pleasure.
I have learned by the public prints, as well as by private letters from Washington, that the imprisonment of those Gentlemen has been the subject of a warm debate in Congress,” and that in the course of it, my Official conduct and character, have been very severely animadverted on, but I trust that ere this the erroneous impressions on this Subject which appear to have been entertained by some Gentlemen in Congress will have been removed by the information which is contained in my letter to Gen' Jackson * on this subject, and which has been communicated by him to the President By the instructions of Gen' Jackson " (of the tenor of which these Officers were well informed) it was made my duty to arrest and imprison any of the Officers included in Gen' Jacksons proclamation who should return without permission. I suffered these Gentlemen to remain two days in Pensacola unnoticed, in the hope, that they would themselves notify me of their arrival, and ask permission to remain, And it was with regret that I issued the warrant on the Third day.
When brought before me, so explicit were my instructions on the
<pb#424 />
subject that no discretion was left to me except in the manner of their imprisonment, And this I ordered to be a Confinement to their own dwellings, upon their parole of honor, And further to give them every liberty consistent with my own duty, as a Subordinate Officer, I sent my Sec” to inform them, that upon their application for leave to attend to their private buisness in this Province, it would at all times be granted to them for ten or twelve days, and would be renewed at their pleasure until I should be further instructed by Gen' Jackson Under these circumstances as I felt myself bound to offer an excuse to Gen' Jackson for not following the strict letter of his instructions, so I felt myself entitled to the gratitud of these gentlemen for the liberality with which I had construed them—I could not therefore have expected any memorial from them could contain authority for such unjust censure upon my conduct in this affair as appears to have been pass'd upon it in the course of this debate—It will appear to the President that as I did not receive notice of Gen'J" resignation until a few days of the time of receiving yours of the 22” Feby I had not the authority absolutely to relieve them, but for those few days, if I had it at all previous to the recognition of my authority contained in your letter.
I hope Sir you have taken similar views of this Subject and that I
shall stand justifyed in the estimation of yourself and of the President I have the honor to be Very Resptly Your Obt Serv-

The principal difficulty is, in regard to the transportation of Slaves from this Territory to the United States Coast-wise, which Slaves may have been either born here, or imported into this Territory from foreign Countries, since the 1* of January 1808, and previously to the Cession of the Floridas to the United States.
I desired also to know whether permission could be given to any of the Inhabitants of this Territory, who were such at the time of the cession, and who were going to the Havana, for a short time, to settle their affairs, to take with them, and bring back, any of their domestic Slaves, as personal Servants."

SIR, The letters from Richards,” Doyle” & several of the Chiefs of the Florida Indians addressed to General Jackson and accompanying his letter to you of the 12" Jan' last,” having been handed to me, I have only to remark that they fully explain the reason of the non attendance of the Indians west of the Suwana river, at the Talk appointed to be held at Alachua on the 20" Nov 1821. The Talk delivered by Gen' Jackson to three of the Chiefs at Pensacola 19”
Sep" 1821,” would have been repeated or formed the basis of the Talk at Alachua. I had procured as presents for the Indians to have been delivered at this Talk, between four & five hundred yards of domestic manufactured cottons, tobacco & a small quantity of powder & lead and provisions for subsistance during the time of holding the Talk. The Indians not assembling at the time appointed
& myself being obliged to attend the Gen' Court Martial at S*Augustine * defeated the intention & almost certainty of concluding with those Indians the preliminaries to a treaty the last year, Under those circumstances I left the goods in charge of M" Wanton who resides at Alachua until difficulties were removed & I should receive further instructions. The means are therefore at hand & in the Indian country for holding a Talk and but little expense is necessary to be incurred in now helding calling the Indians together for con-
<pb#430 />
sultation. The next month is the proper time for doing it, before they go out on the summer hunt.
On the letter of Mr Worthington Secy of East Florida dated 9*
March 1822* & the documents to which they refer, I would respectfully remark, that the license granted to M Levy * to purchase 60
horses & 100 head of cattle will greatly distress those Indians, because if the government concentrate the Florida Indians they must turn their attention to agricultural pursuits, and in that case, horses &
cattle are absolutely necessary—It should be the objects of the Agents of Government in Florida to protect the Indians in the little property they now possess, and I had directed that no sale of negroes, horses or cattle should be made by the Indians to the inhabitants or traders of the country before a treaty should be concluded between them & the United States, when they would be informed of the situation in which they stood with government & what was there true interests.
The amount of Anthony Pastor's account against the United States has been settled & paid by me in full for as much as he is entitled to receive; he is not worthy of confidence, his character may be found among the Spanish documents, & transactions which have come to my knowledge, his services as Interpreter should be discontinued—
Richards now holds the appointment of Interpreter for Seminole Indians and is no doubt worthy of the confidence reposed in him.
I am of opinion that the Indians East of the Suwana should be required to move to that section of country between the Suwana &
Appalachacola rivers & that the Agency be established at Fort Gadsden, S' Marks or within the country assigned to the Indians which I believe would be preferable, and I would respectfully propose, that a government Agent be directed to proceed from S*Augustin through the Indian country to Pensacola with a view to examining into the situation & disposition of the Indians, the most practicable routs for carrying the mails and the most elligible cite for the Agency in Florida.
My accounts for disbursements in the Indian department in Florida will be submitted to the Auditor for settlement and if practicable I
will be prepared to set out for S." Augustin on Thursday next, or at furtherest on the thursday following, the delay to that day, Would be to take with me papers & documents from government to its agents or individuals in that Province.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to submit the enclosed communications to the committee of commerce.
The utility of erecting light houses at all or some of the points designated cannot be doubted. At present the department is not in possession of any other evidence, than what is contained in these papers. An appropriation for two light houses to be erected during the present year, at such points, upon the Florida reef, or upon cape Florida as the President shall designate, will perhaps, be as much as ought to be provided for at the present session. Further information may be obtained, before the next meeting of Congress, which will enable that body to decide whether a greater number ought to be erected.
It is impossible to form a correct estimate of the expense of building two light houses at this time. It is probable that the materials will have to be obtained from a distance; and the provisions necessary to subsist the workmen, as well as the workmen themselves, will have to be obtained in the same manner.

[Enclosure]
Memorandum by John W. Simonton *
[December 7, 1821]
Key West is a small Island immediately on the edge of the Florida Stream, situated in Lat. [blank] Seventy five miles north by west from Havanna & about 85 miles from Matanzas, and quite contiguous to the most of the out ports on the north side of Cuba—say—Bay of Honda, Cabannas, Mariel, St. John de los Remedions, Arraco &c &c which are all places of considerable trade and depend almost entirely upon Havanna for their supplies—It has an uncommon large and safe
<pb#432 />
harbour, where men of war with any draft of water may enter and lay with safety. It has two never failing Springs of water, one of which is quite convenient to the harbour, and wood in great abundance—
An establishment at this Island would be of great importance to the Government, as well as to the Merchants of the United States.
As a harbour and rendezvous for our vessels of war it being one of the most commanding places on the whole coast of Florida.
The revenue that would arise from the importations of Sugar, Coffee &c. the productions of the Island of Cuba, as well as from other places in the Bay of Mexico, the distance being so short that an immense deal of property would be sent there as well as Specie in Vessels which seldom go now from the Coast of Cuba and receive in payment there of the productions of the United States, which trade would be of great advantage to the american commerce. It would be an excellent Harbour for our Merchants vessels to touch at bound to and from the Bay of Mexico to the Atlantic States in cases of distress which too frequently happen when they have no other place to touch at except a port in the Iland of Cuba where they are subjected to heavy expenses—
It is the only eligible situation for a depot for wrecked property on the whole coast of Florida, it being about midway between the dry Tortugas and Cape Florida. We are at this time wholly dependant on the wreckers of New Providence for the protection of our property in case of Shipwreck, and when that occurs it is carried to New Providence, which affords a living to more than 500 persons, and employs 50 or 60 vessels and produces a large revenue to the Government and a great pecuniary benefit to the merchants of that place, because a salvage is generally allowed of from 50 c 75 pr. Cent.
If this place was made a Port of Entry it would in all probability become a place of depot for the productions of other Countries particularly that of Great Britain and France, as it may be termed a key for the whole of the Bay of Mexico and the north side of the Island of Cuba.—
Arrangements are now making and in the event of this place being made a Port of Entry ware houses will immediately be erected under the directions of merchants regularly established there

<place-time>WASHINGTON 26* April 1822</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR, I did myself the honor of calling upon you twice, but was not so fortunate as to have had an opportunity of seeing you.
I therefore take the liberty of writing to you on the subject which I had intended to introduce to your notice in conversation.
M” William Reynolds who now resides at S*Augustine is a native of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His relations are highly respectable & he is according to the best information which I have received a man both of integrity & capacity. He had left Lancaster before I settled there & therefore I was never personally acquainted with him, but I have the fullest confidence in the truth of the statement which I have made, from a knowledge of the character which he has always maintained in the place of his nativity.
M” Reynolds has studied the law & is also well acquainted with the Spanish language, having resided some years in Spain. He was the private Secretary of Captain Bell whilst that gentleman acted as the Secretary of East Florida, & he afterwards discharged the same duties for M. Worthington. He was also one of the Secretaries of the commissioners who examined & seperated the archives & documents taken from the late governor & notary public of S*Augustine.
M” Reynolds is anxious to be appointed a member of the Legislative Council for the territory of Florida. Should you think proper to confer that appointment upon him, I believe he will discharge its duties with satisfaction to yourself & to the public.
M” Reynolds would also be desirous of being appointed one of the Commissioners under the Bill for ascertaining claims & titles to land within the territory of Florida should it become a law.
Should you think proper to make M* Reynolds a member of the Legislative Council, it would confer a favour upon your friend with great respect JAMES BUCHANAN

Decree of Acting Governor Worthington
[March 14, 1822]
BY W. G. D. WORTHINGTON Secretary and Acting Governor of the Province of East Florida Whereas, the benefits resulting to the Citizens and Inhabitants of this Province since its Cession to the United States, from the frequency of the sittings of the Court of the County of St John's as directed in Gen' Jacksons Ordinances N° 4 and 5 appearing to me, now, to have ceased to ensue: and that it would be more for the ease, tranquility and happiness of the Province, that the monthly Terms be abolished, and that there should in future be only Semi-annual Sessions—Therefore, and in Virtue of the Authority vested in me by the President of the U. States—
I do decree—That the 5* Section of the 4* Ordinance and the
8" Section of the 5" Ordinance be and the same are hereby repealed, as they relate to the Quarterly and Monthly meetings of said Court—
And that henceforth, said Court, unless otherwise provided for by Congress, shall hold two Courts, one on the first monday of July—
the other on the first monday of January, annually—With the power
<pb#441 />
to hold such adjourned Courts as may at any time be deemed necessary and proper*
Given at S*Augustine this 14* day of March 1822–
W. G. D. WORTHINGTON Governor
[Endorsed] A. with Mr Worthington's Letter of 3 May 1822.
Acting Governor Worthington to the Court of St. Johns County Executive Department East Florida ST. AUGUSTINE March 16th 1822
Some remarks on the question—
Whether or not in all Civil Cases originating in the County of S"
John's, in the province of East Florida, when the matter in controversy shall exceed Twenty Dollars $20, either party can foarce the other into a Trial by Jury—at this time 2—I suspect not.
1* From the words of the 3* Section of the 4th Ordinance—that the Judicial proceedings in All Civil Cases, shall be according to the existing Laws (of the Spanish Province of E. Florida), or the Laws of Spain—To neither of which has the Trial by Jury been ever known—even the Constitution of the Cortes confines the Right of Trial by Jury to Criminal Cases—and the Laws of Spain and of the Indies recognize no such Tribunal.
2” By the 3" Section of the 3" article of the Constitution of the U. States—The Right of Trial by Jury is limited to matters of Crime and even then, the crimes in cases of Impeachment are excepted–So that under the Constitution the Trial by Jury in Civil Cases cannot be claimed as a right—except as therein specified—
3" By the 7* Article of the Amendments to the Constitution, the Right of Trial by Jury when the value in controversy exceeds $20—is confined to suits at common law—But the Civil Cases in the Court of the County of S" Johns are not according to the course of common law The Criminal cases are expressly so—and the law maxim applies precisly here—that “expressio unius est exclusio alterius” So that to Claim the Trial by Jury under the Amended article—The “existing Laws and Laws of Spain” must give way to the common law—Is this the moment for such an innovation? From all which it follows that at this Time while the cases are pending wherein the question has arisen so—I am of opinion that neither an American nor a Spaniard has a right to force his adversary in a suit in a Civil Case, to a Trial before a Jury—and even if I were to see the expediency and the policy to alter this ordinance in this important respect—My decree could not have an ex-Post facto operation—That would be unconstitutional—And altho’ no man is a more enthusiastic advocate of
<pb#442 />
the Trial by Jury than I am yet viewing the policy and the law of Gen' Jackson and my peculiar situation as I do, I think it neither expedient nor proper at this time to alter his ordinance in this particular.—Upon the subject of Jurisdiction, whether or not the Court have any on cases not originating in the County of S" Johns—I will decline giving an opinion, as the second section of the 4” ordinance"
clothes me with appellate powers and I should thus in a manner, be prejudicating a case which might come before me on this very point—

<docbody>SIR. I have the honor to communicate to you that I have received my Boat the officers and Men from up the River S* John's after an absence of nearly a Month, they are in tolerable health. By the enclosed abstract from M James Hutton who accompanied in the Boat, you can perceive that the number of wood Cutters or depredations committed have been magnified—Co.' Eustis who was on board this Wessel yesterday morning and the Night previous off Augustine has heard of none others. I have however left Gun Vessel N° 158, or Schooner Revenge, to remain and perform the Duty assigned me!”
(N° 168) never having reported: Lieut Commd." Hammersley has gone some distance up and will assist M. Hutton in any further search of inspection—I shall await between the S" Johns and S*Mary's for tomorrows Mail (Weekly) and if nothing intervenes shall prosecute my original cruize as directed—On the Musquito Shore or River, there are three or four Schooners loaded with Live Oak, Cut for the U.S. by

<docbody>SIR—Under Gen' Jackson's Ordinance N° 3 only 40—persons have been naturalized by the Mayor as you will see by the particular return herewith enclosed Marked A *—
The case of Moses Elias Levy is the only one which is special and not strictly within the letter of the Ordinance it is marked B.”—
I issued a Public Notice on the subject Marked C.—determined, that, altho’ the cost to the person Naturalized was only One Dollar to the Secretary, which was paid my private Secretary, they should see my opinion before they incurred that sum—I am of opinion that, a Treaty cannot Naturalize Aliens, a portion no powers derived under it—But the only mode is under the Constitution, prescribed by Congress—A Treaty may be by the President and Senate alone—It requires a uniform mode, by the Congress—However I looked on it as my duty to carry the Ordinance into effect—And I think it was well enough as it furnishes at least evidence of the Intention &c—I send one of my forms of Naturalization Marked D'—
<pb#452 />
As I wrote you heretofore when the County Court laid Taxes—I
suspended their collection as also of the City Council—And E * is an order from the same Court, respecting the Public Road [MS. torn]

Notice All persons wishing to avail themselves of the benefit of Gen.
Jacksons 3" Ordinance, by obtaining Certificates of Citizenship as therein prescribed, are informed that such Certificates, may be had on producing the requisite proofs, at the Public Office of the Secretary and Acting Governor of this province, at the Old Gov" House on Constitution Square Those who feel so disposed may, possibly, by complying with the Ordinance before the 17" of July next, avoid doubts which may arise respecting any of their rights &c—It is thought not unnecessary to suggest that the following classes of persons may perhaps more immediately derive advantages from it
1* All native Spaniards who wish to become American Citizens
2" All English or other Foreign Subjects or citizens who may have been in the Floridas on or before the 17* July 1821
3" All American Citizens who resided here, during the English or Spanish occupation and possession of the province and denationalized themselves by becoming English or Spanish Subjects The Secretary and Acting Governor gives no Constitutional or legal opinion on the power or effect of this mode of Naturalization—
Tho', he hesitates not, to say that no person can hold any office of Honor Profit or Trust under the Gov' of Florida without first taking
<pb#453 />
the oath to support the Constitution of the U.S. He only orders me to inform such inhabitants of Oriental Florida, as may wish to avail themselves of the ordinance, that proper blanks are duly prepared and may be had by applying to me at his office By order of W.

<docbody>SIR On the 19* Ulto an appeal under the 2" Section of Gen.'
Jackson's 4" Ordinance,” was brought up and argued before me—
I felt myself bound to hear the case: & to give the tribunal, all the effect it deserved, I Presided in a Judicial costume & organized the
<pb#458 />
court in the way I thought best—The proceedings were conducted with much gravity & decorum—But the act for the government of Florida, of the 30" March last, having reached me, accidentally, in the Public papers while the case was before me, I conceived it devested me of all Judicial cognizance—Yet as it might be some time before the President could send on the new officers, & I deemed it absolutely necessary for the Peace & order of this Province, that neither anarchy nor interregnum should take place—I gave my opinion that the sixth section divested me of my judicial powers—& as there were persons specially vested with Judicial powers & who in my opinion would continue untill superceded in fact—I deemed it indubitably politic and expedient to take this ground, even if it were not strictly legal.
Yet I think it also sound Law—As I viewed my Judicial & Legislative powers, secondary, incidental & inferior to my Executive; they might be & were lopped off on the passage of the act: but my Executive existed till I received instructions that they had ceased or I was notified by the new officers of their [MS. torn] succeeded to them—
In a state or Territory distant from the supreme enacting power; I
consider this continuing in offices, ’till the successors actually take possession of them, or they are divested by instructions from the proper authority, is a matter of state necessity–And the old officers still remain with necessary powers to keep the antecedent system in existence, even by new appointments, if necessary—For I have as much horror at a vacuum in the Political world as the sage Stagyrite, had at one in the Physical—I gave a full & pretty warm opinion in the case of M" Hardy vs Saavedra; but it was oral; except the inclosed order N° 4—which, when taken into connection with the other inclosures from 1 to 10, will shew my mode of proceeding—There is a voluminous record of the case—and it unfolds one of the most corrupt
& flagrant instances of official wickedness or weakness, or both, in Gov. Coppinger & judge Saavedra of which I have ever read in any court, since the days of Jeffries” & Bromly"—M Rodman, who advised the appointment of D. Gibson," is the Prosecuting Attorney for the Province, the Law officer, & has been so nearly ever since the commencement of the Court—So that if ever I am, in point of Law, incorrect, I consulted the proper officer and made the appointment at his request—But D* Gibson never acted—so it is an abortion—
Whatever instructions the government will be pleased to give me on these subjects, I will with great cheerfulness pursue—In the mean time I will make every one stand to his post, or it will stand alone—
<pb#459 />
'till I am properly releived—This remark may [MS. torn] like misanthropy or querulousness, but I assure you, it is made, tho' with pain, yet not in ill humor—that in all my life I never saw so much little villainy & experienced so much mean ingratitude around me, as I have in this last year—However I defy malice itself to substantiate, not only one vitious, but even, intentionally, one improper proceeding, in my whole administration—To act the part of an upright, independent officer here, not to link in with certain classes of persons, I soon saw would be the least profitable and popular course—But I adopted it from the beginning & have persisted in it—It was what the President expected of me—And I dont repent it—For one of my great principles of belief is—that there is a Moral Government in this world—
And whenever a man knowingly does wrong, he will as certainly, as he does it, be well punished here for it—in some way or another, independent of his amenibility to chastisement hereafter—And I am equally confident if he does right, he will be rewarded here or hereafter—But I have long been fixed in the idea of that great moral influence acting upon us & of that Retributive Juctice falling sooner or later in this life, on those who may deserve it *-

Court of St Johns & the Justices of the Peace thereof, also Continued till superseded in fact, by the respective Officers of those Courts appointed under the new Government—Judge Murray having handed me his resignation, today, of the 7" Inst, the other Judges I conceive still in office under the above opinion—

Acting Governor Worthington to John Rodman and John Drysdale Executive Department EAST FLORIDA May 18" 1822
GENTLEMEN When you did me the honor on the 13" inst to wait on me at the Government House, I understood you that M Law, who was the only justice of the Quorum for the County of St Johns, residing here, had taken up the idea, that in my opinion in the case of M*Hardy & Saavedra, the Florida act of the 30" of March, had vacated his commission & altho' you had some important & pressing legal business, he declined acting, unless you got my opinion that he was still in office—I, on that statement wrote my opinion of the 13"
Inst.—I understood he afterwards acted—But on the 15—resumed the notion he was not now in office—and altho’ he received his appointment from me, he was going to forward his resignation to Judge Duval, whom it was rumoured here, had been appointed Governor of Florida—
That being the case Mr Rodman said, it would be necessary to have a Justice of the Quorum appointed, as M. Bethune lived in Amelia, M” Reynolds & M." Fatio on the St Johns, a long distance from here—
That certain persons were about going to the Havana, and unless a justice of the Quorum was appointed, Major Murray having heretofore resigned, there would be a failure of legal proceedings—That M Rodman & M Drysdale recommended Dr Edward R. Gibson as the most fit person that they knew of. I had told Mr Drysdale &
Rodman & others that if it became necessary in any case, I would act so as that redress should be somewhere—I then made out a commission for Doctor Gibson & gave it to Mr Rodman—saying, the D"
could accept or not as he thought proper–On the 17* D* Gibson &
M Rodman called on me, I shewed them my commissions & told them that the existing officers ought to continue ’till superseded under the new system—On the 18. Dr Gibson resigned—I told M. Drysdale if he could recommend any other fit person & he was necessary, I
would appoint him—Determined that nothing like an interregnum should take place—Deeming it necessary for the peace and tranquillity of this Province that I ought to risk all responsibility on this subject, if any existed: as in cases of Felony&cit was necessary to have judicial
<pb#462 />
officers in existence, sufficient in number to answer the ends of Government &c and that they could not be appointed under the new law for some months after its passage—So the affairs stand—I am determined to hold my ground as long as I deem it necessary for the peace & good order of Florida—The moment I receive official Instruction of being superseded & that my office is at an end—I will most cheerfully acquiesce in it & not attempt another official act. Till then, I will do as little as I can under this dubious & equivocal state of things—but I will do enough to shew every one that the U. States Civil officers are still in existence here, and will do what they conceive their duty—I
say nothing against those who chose to differ from me—I
will do, myself, what I think the Gov" of the U States expects from me
& I will by all honest and fair means endeavour to induce others to do the same—Not to suffer Anarchy, interregnum or the stepping in of anything like despotism—
Please say whether I am correct in the matters of fact; or what is the full and correct state of things on which you have acted—
Yours Respectfully W. G. D. WORTHINGTON

[Enclosures:ALS]
John Rodman to Acting Governor Worthington ST. AUGUSTINE 20th May 1822
SIR, I have had the honour to receive your letter of the 18th Inst addressed to M* Drysdale and myself. In answer to which, as far as relates to myself, I beg leave to make the following observations:
After the delivery of your opinion in the case of McHardy against Saavedra, Judge Law most assuredly did express doubts in regard to the existance of the County Court, and hesitated to grant orders in his character of Judge of that Court. He said that he considered the late act of Congress, providing for the Government of Florida, as virtually abolishing the County Court. Upon observing to him that you had not gone so far in the opinion you had pronounced in the above mentioned cause, he expressed a desire to see that opinion.
It was in consequence of this desire that M. Drysdale and myself took the liberty to call on you and request a copy of it. When it was shown to Judge Law, as I am informed by M. Drysdale, he seemed to acquiesce in its correctness, in regard to the County Courts, and the existance of his powers still as a Judge—in consequence of which he signed a writ of injunction in a cause then just instituted in that Court.
<pb#463 />
The next day, however, he again expressed doubts of his powers as a Judge, and finally declined signing any more orders, or in any other matter acting in that capacity. He therefore returned me a paper containing an order to examine a witness in a cause pending in the County Court, and who was about to leave this place for the Havana, declaring that he did not consider himself authorised to sign the order. It was on this occasion in M* Gibbs’s office that he mentioned his intention of resigning, and said that he should send his resignation to Governor Duval at Pensacola. Upon my suggesting to him the propriety of sending it to you, in order that you might make another appointment in his place, he observed that he viewed the late act of Congress as abrogating your powers, as acting Governor, and that the most proper course would be to send his resignation to Governor Duval.
There being then no Judge here to act, and having some cases of an urgent nature, in which orders to hold to bail and to examine witnesses were necessary, I took the liberty to call on you and represent the embarassing situation in which we were placed, and the serious evils which must flow from an opinion in the community that the functions of the Judges had ceased, and that there was neither law nor Justice in the Country—and could be none until the late Act of Congress should go into operation. You did not hesitate to declare that you considered your powers as acting Governor, under your commissions and the official instructions from the President, through M” Adams, as still subsisting; and in consequence you appointed D"
Gibson to the office of Judge of the County Court. This gentleman, at first, accepted, but without doing any one Act as a Judge, the next day thought proper to resign. Thus, we are left without any Judge, in this place, to discharge the most important duties connected with the public peace and the administration of Justice.
I have now, I believe stated all the facts, within my knowledge, to which you allude in your letter.
With regard to the opinion you have expressed respecting your powers, as acting Governor, still subsisting, and that they must necessarily subsist until you receive a supersedeas, or some other official Notice of their termination; and also in relation to the continued existance of the County Court, I have no hesitation in saying that I agree with you.
I must confess that we are in an anomalous state of things. The late Act of Congress providing for the government of Florida, though said to be drawn up by men of abilities, is vague and ambiguous on many important points, and woefully deficient in the most essential one—the Judiciary. But the provision in the last section but one, for the continuance of the existing laws, until altered or annulled by the Legislative Council, I conceive gives complete Sanction to the
<pb#464 />
ordinances of Gov. Jackson, and consequently the Continuance of the County Court—Justices of the peace, and City Council of St.
Augustine, established by those ordinances.
I know, indeed, that a contrary opinion is entertained by some respectable persons in this place; but this appears to me necessarily to lead to anarchy and confusion. In that case, we should, until the Legislative Council meet and provide otherwise, be without law either civil or criminal. Crimes of the deepest dye would go unpunished.
Every specious of violence and disorder might be committed before our eyes with impunity. Some persons, indeed, are willing to admit that the County Court, Justices of the peace and City Council are still in lawful existance, but that your powers as acting Governor, have ceased, and that should all the Judges and Justices die or resign, their places could not be filled up by you. This reasoning appears to me but little less absurd than the other.
Would it not lead to the same dreadful consequences? Suppose all the Justices of the peace in this City, entertaining the scruples which opinions of this nature are calculated to engender, should immediately give up their commissions, what authority would remain, I would ask, to arrest any criminal however heinous the offense charged against him? None indeed, but the Military—and I forbear to dwell on the consequences which would result to the Country at large from such a state of things.
With great respect, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant J. RODMAN

John Drysdale to Acting Governor Worthington S*AUGUSTINE 20 May 1822
SIR I have had the honor to receive your Letter of the 18 Ins", addressed to M Rodman and myself jointly, on the subject of some recent transactions growing out of the present state of the Judiciary in this Territory, and of the exercise of your powers as Governor of it;
in which you are pleased to desire that we should say, whither you are correct in the matters of fact contained in it, and what the full and correct state of things on which we have acted, in the transactions referred to, is—
As some of the circumstances adverted to in your Letter took place with, and in the presence of, us separately, in the course of our profes-
<pb#465 />
sional avocations; and as the conduct of Gentlemen holding official stations is the subject of our present intercourse; it is deemed proper, both by M Rodman & myself, that we should severally and separately reply to your enquiries-
The statement contained in your Letter of what transpired between you M Rodman and myself in the interview we had the honor to have with you at the Government House on the 13 Inst is according to my recollection perfectly correct—That interview was one sought by me and participated in by M Rodman at my request; and my desire of it arose out of a previous refusal by Judge Law to grant on my application an order for Bail. This refusal of the Judge was founded on the impression that the recent act of Congress making provision for the Government of this Territory, in connection with that of the last year making temporary provision for its Government, had wholly superseded the powers of the Judicial officers appointed by Governor Jackson The fact of Judge Laws refusal to act officially and the above cause of it, were in the interview referred to, stated to you by M Rodman & myself—We farther, in accordance with a desire expressed by Judge Law, requested and obtained from you, in writing, the substance of your opinion, as to the particular point of the present powers of the Judges of the County Courts and the Justices of the peace, delivered by you in your recent decision of the Appellate cause of M*Hardy against Saavedra—This statement was delivered to Judge Law on the following morning; and judging from his conduct, I did suppose, -either, that the opinion which it contained, on the subject of his doubts, had removed them; or that allowing it the weight which the decision of an Appellate Tribunal on a doubtful point is entitled to, he acquiesced in it—The conduct to which I refer and which justified these conclusions was—the granting a Writ of Injunction applied for by me, and an expression of his willingness to grant the order for Bail previously refused—In the course of one or two days however Judge Law's mind on the question of his powers again changed, and returned to the opinion that his Judicial authority was at end; and the the Declaration on which the Judge was to have given the order for Bail before referred to was returned to me without it—
Although I did not personally recommend D. Gibson to the seat on the Bench recently vacated by Judge Murrays resignation, I approved of it highly—I had been consulted by M. Rodman previously to his recommendation of that Gentleman to this place, and I concurred with him entirely in opinion that he was the fittest person in this City whose situation would admit of the acceptance of it, to fill this office-
Not imagining for a moment that my name could have had any influence on your mind in the appointment of D. Gibson, I yet beg to state that so far as M. Rodman may have used it in his recommendation of that Gentleman, he was fully authorised so to do—The circum-

These I think are all the facts within my own immediate knowledge connected with your enquiries; and they form the basis of any agency or concern which I may have had in relation to the subjects of your Letter Aware as I am of the entire inefficacy to any useful purpose of the expression of my approbation or disapprobation of the conduct pursued by you upon the present singularly embarrassed state of the Government of this Territory and of your own situation particularly, I may yet, I would hope, without incurring the imputation of presumption, be permitted to state, that it has met my unqualified approbation—If the administration of justice shall now be denied, and thence in many cases be forever lost,-if crime shall stalk abroad in open day and go unpunished, of the population of this country, of a mixed and unsettled character generally, and partially passing from a state of comparative despotism, shall learn by the absence of all law that its power consists mainly in the habitual reverence which is yielded to it, and hereafter continue its renewed application,-you will be enabled conscientiously to hold yourself clear of these evils—
of the continuing power of the Judicial officers appointed previously to the passage of the late act of Congress, so far as the validity of such appointments depends on the nonexistence of that act, I am firmly, though perhaps erroneously persuaded—of the continuance of your powers as the Gov' of this Territory so far as concerns the appointment of judicial officers, admitting these powers to have been lawfully exercised before the passage of the late act of Congress, I am bound by a regard to candor to say, that I have serious doubts Yet convinced as I am that every exercise of power since your executive authority has been questioned, has been assumed by you for the manifest good of the public, -the error, if in truth any have been committed, is entitled in my opinion not merely to forbearance but to respect and applause—because committed in such a manner as to violate no rights, and on one of those occassions on which a due sense of public duty demanded the hazard of private responsibility—I

<docbody>SIR, The Grand Inquest for the District of West Florida at the term of May 1822 made presentment of the utter insufficiency of the public Jail of West-Florida which presentment I learn has not as yet been made known to the Government.—The Calabozo, or public Goal of Pensacola in use during the time of the Spanish possession, is now in such a state of dilapidation as to be wholly unfitted for the confinement of Offenders—who have been & probably will be for some years henceforth, on account of our local situation and for other causes of such a class as to require the strongest edifice for their accomodation or security. The only method which was practicable for the Safe Keeping of the Crew of the Pirates belonging to the
<pb#468 />
Schooner Carmen—tried here in January last was by turning them over to the Col. commanding the 4* Regm' U. S. Inf by whom a daily guard was detailed from the Reg" for a period of some months, for their Security. In a late instance it became necessary also to make a call upon the officer commanding the 4* Reg' U. S. Art” on this station to receive two Prisoners charged with serious offences, the officer did not decline, but after expressing a wish to do every thing in his power to promote justice, intimated, that the reception of the Prisoners would be for many reasons a serious inconvenience, which he would if possible most gladly avoid. This being the State of things, and the population being yet so small here as to make it impossible for the Marshal to detail a sufficient Citizen's guard in such cases it is beleived the Government will realize the necessity of taking measures for the speedy erection of a suitable Public Prison for this District.
The records required by the Circular of the 23"April ult” are herewith transmitted together with a Bill of charges.”—

Humphreys who was also an applicant, before the President for the appointment of Agent in Florida. After due consideration the President nominated Col. Humphrey.” His recent disbandment which was one of the hardest cases at the late reduction, and his present restricted means of support, of himself and family gave him high claims to the patronage of the government. His selection was induced wholly by these considerations, and not upon any idea of superior fitness over yourself. On the contrary the President would have availed himself of your capacity and experience in the affairs of the Indians in Florida, but for the reasons above mentioned. The President considered that your present command in the Army did not throw you so peculiarly upon the patronage of the government Under this view you will see that the appointment of Col. Humphrey was in a degree unavoidable, and was not made in preference to yourself, or from any diminution of confidence in your capacity and integrity. -

<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY W* P DUVALL Governor of Florida Pensacola SIR, The Governor of the territory of Florida to which Office you have been appointed,” being charged, ex Officio, with the Superintendence of Indian affairs within that territory, I herewith enclose to you Copies of the Act regulating intercourse with the Indian tribes, passed the 30* March 1802,” and of the amendatory acts passed in
1816," and at the late session of Congress" which indicate your duties, generally, as superintendent of Indian affairs.
There will be within your superintendency one Indian Agent and one sub agent. Col°. Humphreys, late of the Army, has been appointed the Agent & Cap' Pelham, also of the Army, the Sub Agent.
Col°. Humphreys will be directed to report himself to you,” and you will give him such instructions as you may deem necessary to insure a just and faithfull execution of the several provisions of the enclosed Acts, and of such other duties as must necessarily arise out of his intercourse with the Indians. He will report to you, from time to time, his proceedings, and keep you informed of every thing which may be interesting to be known in relation to the Indians; which you will communicate to this Department as often as you may judge necessary. The sub Agent will be under the control of the Agent, as well as yourself, and will make his reports and communications thro’ him, except when that course will be attended with inconvenience or delay—in which case he will communicate directly to you.
You will require the Indian Agent to furnish you regularly with quarterly estimates of the expenses of his Agency including the pay of the sub agent, from which you will make out a general estimate of the expenses of the Indian Department within your superintendency, as much in detail as possible, for each quarter; which you will transmit to this Department, one quarter in advance, and upon which funds will be remitted to you from the Treasury. Your draft of the 30th of April, last, in favor of Levi Tyler, for $600, has been presented and
<pb#473 />
paid, and will be considered a part of the sum allotted to your superintendency; but in future no drafts will be made on this Department—
funds will be remitted to you from the Treasury upon your quarterly estimates only, unless this Department, under particular circumstances should direct otherwise. You will pay the agent his salary and place in his hands quarterly, out of the funds that may be allotted to your Superintendency for presents to Indians and Contingencies, such sums to be applied to those objects, as may appear to you from his estimates and your own observation, to be necessary and required by the public interest. The sub Agent will be paid, thro’ the Agent, quarterly, or if more convenient he may be paid by you.
The following sums have been allotted, out of the appropriations for this year, for the expenses of the Indian Department within your superintendency, to wit:
For pay of Sub Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 500
For presents to Indians . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1000
For Contingencies—to wit—pay of 1000
Interpreters, rations to Indians & ' ' ' ' ' ' '
$2,500
In the above allotment of funds nothing is included for the pay of the Indian Agent, as it is uncertain at what time he will be ready to commence his duties: Whenever he reports to you and commences them, you will include in your quarterly estimates the sum that will be necessary to pay his Salary, which is fixed by law at the rate of $1500–
per annum.
The sums allowed for the pay of a Sub Agent, presents and Contingencies, must, in no event, without the authority of this Department, be exceeded.
The Act making it the duty of the Territorial governors to act as Superintendents of Indian affairs affixes no Compensation for duty,”
it nevertheless has been usual to allow the expense which they may incur in performing their duty, and extra compensation for extra duty, (that is, such as is not attached to them as Superintendents,)
where it has been performed. On an Account rendered, your actual expenses resulting from your intercourse with the Indians will be allowed; and should you be called on to perform any duty which does not belong to you as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, on a Certified statement of the facts, suitable Compensation will be made.
M’ Worthington the late Secretary and acting Governor of Florida drew on this Department some time ago for $1000, on account of Indian expenses, and he has been directed to pay over the balance
<pb#474 />
remaining in his hands to Cap" Pelham, the Sub Agent—If Cap'
Pelham has received this balance you will ascertain of him the amount of it, and, if the whole or any part of it has been expended by him, direct him to render you an account thereof—Should any balance remain, he will hold it subject to your orders.
The Act passed at the late session of Congress contains several new and important provisions to which your attention is particularly called. You will require the Indian Agent to make to you regular returns of the licenses issued by him in virtue of the authority vested in him by the 1* Section of this act, and you will make out, in the manner and form therein prescribed, an abstract of all licenses issued by the Agent or by yourself, to the 1* September in each year, which you will transmit to this Department annually on that day, or as soon thereafter as practicable, to be laid before Congress.
A punctual compliance with the 3"Section, relative to the settlement of Accounts, will be rigidly exacted. The law is imperative and a failure, on the part of those concerned, to comply with its requisitions in this respect, will render it necessary to report them as delinquents, and to withhold from them any further advance of funds, until these accounts shall have been settled. The accounts of the Agent should be rendered to you quarterly, to be transmitted to this Department with your own for the same period, as soon after the close of each quarter as practicable—At all events, the agents accounts as well as your own, for the whole year, must be transmitted within one month after the 1st of September in each year, so as to be settled to that period, annually, as required by the Act. The accounts of the Agent as well as your own must be accompanied by a general abstract of all disbursements, within each quarter—for the present year to the 1st September next, and regularly thereafter for every year ending on that day—detailing under distinct heads the various objects of disbursement, to wit: pay of Agent, sub Agent, & Interpreters, presents, rations &c. &c. so as to leave as few as possible to be embraced under the general head of “Contingencies”. To this abstract a statement must be annexed, shewing the names of all persons who have been employed, in the Indian Department, by the Agent or yourself, within each quarter, as Interpreters or any other capacity whatever, with the amount of wages paid them respectively. These abstracts and statements are indispensibly necessary, to enable the Department to lay before Congress the annual statement required by the 3* Section of the Act, and should be carefully prepared and punctually rendered.
The accounts with the abstracts and statements will be examined by you and transmitted to this Department, with such explanations and remarks thereon as you may think proper to make, for revision, previous to their being passed to the 2nd Auditor for settlement.
<pb#475 />
It is deemed unnecessary to enlarge upon all the points to which your attention will be directed by the Act of 1802 and the amendatory acts herewith, not doubting but your judgment will suggest to you every thing which may be necessary to a due execution of all of their provisions Orders have been given, thro’ the proper Officer, to Officers commanding military posts in relation to the execution of the duty required of them by the 2nd Section of the act passed at the late Session of Congress."

<docbody>SIR/ By yesterday's mail, I received an Official communication from the Department of State dated the 17" of May,” enclosing my Commission (dated 25* April ") as Secretary of the Territory of Florida. I gratefully accept this flattering mark of the President's confidence and good opinion, and through you take the liberty of respectfully offering him my thanks.
With the exception of M* Overton, one of the Commissioners," and Dr Bronaugh," none of the gentlemen appointed to Offices in the Territory have arrived here—Governor Duval has not been heard from since he was seen by Dr Bronaugh in Kentucky, but we are in daily expectation of seeing him. Last Monday the four members of the Council who reside at this place, (but who have not yet received their Commissions,) met according to the provision of the Act of Congress, and adjourned until the Monday following. What prospect there is of the arrival of the Members from St. Augustine I am unable to say.
My situation at present is extremely unpleasant. An Opinion prevails among many that the temporary organization under Gen.'
Jackson expired of itself with the end of the last Session of Congress, and that no legal Government can exist, until the one provided by the last Act of Congress shall be put in operation. For my own part I
entertain no doubt that until the present government, be actually and practically superceded, it is my duty to proceed as heretofore-A
different determination would lead to results from which the mind would revolt. Under existing circumstances I have endeavoured to do the best in my power. But in this state of uncertainty, almost all public business is at a stand, and some embarrassment has been Occasioned.”
15 Not found.
<pb#477 />
I have not yet received any intimation from the Department of State, of the amount which would be allowed me for my services as Secretary and Acting Governor of West Florida. This is at the present moment peculiarly desirable to me in order that I may be enabled to make arrangements which may be important to my private affairs.—
I drew upon your Department on the 8” of October for three hundred dollars, on the 12* of November for four hundred dollars, and on the 13" of May for five hundred dollars—Not Knowing the exact sum I may expect to be allowed me, I have refrained from drawing for a greater amount until I should be informed on the subject.
I beg leave to call your attention to my letter of the 4” of December last "on the subject of the rent of the house which I at present occupy, and the extra expenses I have unavoidably incurred, and most earnestly request that it be laid before the President for his consideration, if the subject has not already been settled. -
For yourself, Sir, be pleased to accept the assurances of my sincere respect and high consideration.” - -

<docbody>SIR I have just received a letter from Alexander Hamilton Esq."
of S*Augustine informing me of the death of the Revd Mr Crosby *
for many years Roman Catholic pastor of that City,–The letter contains the following passage
“I have been given to understand that the Church property belonged to the King of Spain, & by relation it has become that of the United States, of course, whenever the United States shall act, they will dispose of it in such manner as will be adapted to the political changes of this country.”—
I beg to apprise your Excellency of this in order to put you immediately in possession of the facts, –& to submit, that when the King of Spain or any other Sovereign power gives property to any corporation, such as under Spain the Roman Catholic Church of Augustine was, the sovereign divests himself thereof & vests it in the corporation to whom it is given,—At the cession of Florida then this property did not belong to the King of Spain, but to the Roman Catholic Church of S*Augustine, it was not of course transferred to the United States as the transfer to them was not the transfer of Church property which this was & is, but of Crown property which this was not.—The death of Mr Crosby nearly twelve months after the cession & possession of the territory of Florida could make no change whatever in the title of the property, if it belonged to the State during his life the claim would have been made & the possession sought then,—I can not vouch for the accuracy of my information, nor for the correctness of my surmises but though I acquit M” Hamilton altogether of any sinister intentions, still I suspect from information which I have received that the teachers of another religious body who have very few, if any adherents in S*Augustine wish to deprive the Roman Catholics who are the principal & most numerous body of inhabitants of their property.—I have during some months past been frequently prepared for the attempt which is now likely to be made—
The Roman Catholics claim no privileges to which their fellow Citizens are not entitled—they claim no favour or affection in the eye of the State, but they do expect that by becoming Citizens of the United States they shall not lose the property which they previously possessed & held until now—
The Roman Catholics have been making arrangements to conform in every thing to the Spirit of this republic, and as those of Florida
<pb#479 />
have hitherto been subject to the Bishop of Havanna, they conceive it would be more accordant to the wishes & feelings of their fellow citizens that they should be under the Spiritual jurisdiction of an American Citizen, & hence the necessary regulations for effecting this object have been commenced at Rome, by whose sanction the regulations must be completed—They calculated upon those funds with the loss of which they are now threatened, as the means of enabling them to effect their object, Your Excellency will I am convinced immediately perceive that national & individual justice, peace, harmony & the public good require that the Roman Catholics of the Territory of Florida shall be permitted to retain the possession of those funds for the support of religion which they held previous to at the time of, & since their admission into the Union—
With high sentiments of respect, esteem & confidence I remain Your Excellency’s Most obedient humble Servant JOHN, Bishop of Charleston—

<source>[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:AL *]</source>
<place-time>- ST. AUGUSTINE 18th June 1822</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, The writer of this letter is a native American Citizen, and a resident inhabitant of East Florida. He feels a deep interest in the welfare and prosperity of this Territory.
He is persuaded that several highly improper appointments have been made to the civil offices in this Country;-and he feels it now his duty to warn the government against an appointment, reported to be about to be made of very considerable importance. It is that of a Collector of the Customs at Key West. -
It is understood here that George Murray Esqr., commonly called Major Murray, and sometimes Judge Murray, from his having, for a short time been one of the Judges of the County Court in this Territory, appointed by Mr Worthington, while acting as Governor here. Major Murray left this place about three weeks ago for Washington—nobody, but his confidential friends, could divine his object, after the adjournment of congress—but it has since leaked out, indeed, avowed by one of his friends, that he went for the purpose of getting the office of Collector at Key-West—and that he meant to avail himself of a Strong recommendation in his favour for a very different office, which had imprudently been signed by many respectable inhabitants in this place, who at the time were very far from imagining the use to which that recommendation either was originally intended to be put, or might be turned. He was recommended to fill the place of M* Segui a Spanish gentleman here, who had been appointed by the President, one of the Legislative Council to meet at Pensacola the 10" of this month.
M. Segui, at first agreed to go, but Mr Hernandez having declined going,-M* Segui also declined—and as the inhabitants of this place were extremely desirous that East Florida, should have its full proportion of representatives in the Council, they immediately, on M* Segui's
<pb#481 />
declining looked about for a person to fill his place, who would go to Pensacola with the other Counsellers, who were then about to sail from this place, and there wait for his Commission from Washington;
presuming that the President would, in order to fill up the vacancy—
appoint any person who should be well recommended by the inhabitants here. Major Murray then offered himself—said that he was going to Pensacola, at all events, and was very desirous of being appointed a Counsellor-There was no other person could be found willing to go at the hazard of being appointed—and although many objections were mentioned to Major M.—as it was an office of no pecuniary responsibility, and nothing required of him but merely to give his vote for the removal of the Seat of Government to this place, which he solemnly pledged his honour to do. A Memorial was drawn up with a pretty strong recommendation, to which a number of names were obtained, every body being anxious that we should have a full representation in the Council—This memorial was sent on to the President-But, behold, the next day when the vessel was under way for Pensacola, Major Murray instead of going on board of her went on board a vessel for Baltimore, and his friends said he was gone to Washington. The people here, as may naturally be supposed were highly displeased with this conduct. There was, however, no remedy—it was too late to apply for a commission for another person—and thus, by the appointment of M. Gibson who is somewhere in Georgia or S" Carolina, and who will not go to Pensacola and the appointment of two Spanish gentlemen here who have both declined. East Florida will not have its just number of Counsellors—
and Pensacola will preponderate and give us the law, and keep the Seat of government there.
From the conduct of Major Murray some idea may be formed of his sense of propriety in public affairs. Every body was astonished when Gov" Worthington appointed him a Judge—he had never distinguished himself in any manner at the bar, nay, it was well known that he was very little accustomed to the practice of the law he had been in the Navy and in the Army *—There being, however, no other lawyer on the Bench he became Chief Justice—but never charged either the grand or petty Jury—and on All occasions showed the most profound ignorance of the business of the Court. In fact he was absolutely incompetent for the discharge of the duties of the office. He resigned a short time before he projected the Jouney to Pensacola.
While on the Bench, there were Several suits pending against one John B Strong—a man here of notorious bad character—Strong fearing that Judgments would be rendered ag" him, in order to cover
<pb#482 />
his property from execution, made a Conveyance to Major Murray of the Island of Key West which he pretended then to own, and also of a very large tract of land at Cape Florida, and took Major Murray's note for what he pretended was the consideration money—Murray at this time knew of the suits pending against Strong, as they were before his eyes every day in the Calendar of the Court—and Strong told him the reason he wished to make the conveyance to him—
namely, to defeat the just claims of his Auditors—Murray while chief Judge of the Court became a party to this fraudulent transaction, so far as to become the nominal purchaser of these tracts of lands for Strong has told several persons since his reasons for making the sale to Murray. The causes, however, ag" Strong were dismissed from the docket, on the ground that under Gen' Jackson's ordinances, the cause of action originating out of the County, the Court had no Jurisdiction of the matter.—Strong then went to Charleston and sold the island of Key West to Gen' Geddes and the other tract of land to a M. Delespine, without mentioning to them, at the time, a word of the conveys to Major Murray—they however, afterwards found it out, and demanded an explanation—he then confessed to them the circumstance of the transaction and admitted that the conveyance to Murray was only a cover to prevent his Creditors from seizing the land, and promised to obtain a re-conveyance from Murray. This, however, has not yet been done—and it is understood that Murray means to insist on his title to Key West, if not to the other tract conveyed to him by Strong—and it is now reported that he is actually applying to be made Collector of that port of Entry and has great expectations of obtaining the office. Of this gentleman's private character, the writer of this letter knows very little; except what these transactions indicate—That he is utterly incompetent to fill such an office as that of Collector, must be allowed by all who know him. He is a man of very idle habits, knows nothing of business—
and has no inclination for it—With regard to Key West it may be well to mention that there is another claimant, whose title appears to stand upon much better ground than either Strong's—Murray's, or Genl Geddes—this is a M. Simonton now at the Havana—he purchased the island from Salas the grantee under the Spanish government—took possession of it and made improvements thereon, long before the Sale either to Murray or Geddes—and he has now actually many people working on the island–Genl Geddes has also some people there, and is going there himself—There is now a suit pending between Geddes & Simonton respecting the title to the island—but it is said that Major Murray intends to put in his claim to it—
The writer of this letter has no sort of ill will or animosity towards Major Murray—but he thinks it a duty he owes to his Country to state the facts mentioned herein, that the President may be on his
<pb#483 />
gaurd against the imposing recommendation already sent in favour of that Gentleman for a very different situation from that which it is understood he now solicits—All the facts in relation to these fraudulent conveyances of Strong, have transpired Since the recommendation was signed here. This communication it is hoped, will be considered as confidential—

22. Another Town in Florida Point called O-chee-fro-crassa, these moved down from the Upper Creeks, about 30 warriors, and a great many women children settled there.
The foregoing list of Indian settlements is extracted from a talk held by Gen.' And" Jackson Gov' of the Floridas, with three chiefs of the Florida Indians, viz:—Blount, Nea-moth-la and Mulatto King, at Pensacola 19* September 1821.
To the foregoing list may be added the following number of settlements in East Florida, which are not included. viz:
23. Pe-lac-le-ka-ha, The present residence of the Chief of the Seminole Nation, situatied about 100 miles south of Alachua, in the direction of Tampa Bay.
24. Chu-ka-chatta, fifteen or 20 miles south of Pelaclekaha.
25. Hich-e-puc-sasse, about 20 miles south east of Chukachatta and

chatta is the most numerous of the Seminole settlements.
30. King Heijahs negro settlement, south of Alachua, and late Paynes fields in Alachua, most of them Indian slaves.
The foregoing additional list, are Seminoles—
31. O-ke-fe-no-ke swamp a number of Cawetas.
32. Black Creek, there is a settlement of Chehaws.
33. Spring Garden above Lake George a number of Uchees.
34. West side of Cape Florida a settlement of Chactaws.
<pb#485 />
35. Alachua, west of Paynes Savanna, is John Hicks' Town of Miccasukeys, contains about 20 well constructed buildings.
The whole number of Indian population may be rated at not less than five thousand souls, with about three hundred slaves, belonging to the Seminoles. The Seminoles constitute about one third of the whole population and claim the right of soil to all the country east of a grant to Forbs & co, south of the Georgia Line, North & East of the Gulf of Mexico, and West of a boundary line agreed upon between the English and Indians at a Congress held at Picolata 18 Nov 1765.
and since recognized by the Spanish authorities.
The foregoing exhibit, is respectfully communicated, to shew the dispersed state of the Indians in Florida; requiring some immediate steps to be taken on the part of government, authorizing the collecting or concentrating these scattered bands at some place suitable for them to become cultivators and to extinguish their title to so much of their country as may not be required for themselves as cultivators of the soil, if it should be found, they possess the title—At present there is no white settlements in East Florida within the Indian boundary, and they will not permit any to be made, until they are brought under the protection of the U. States—which they look to with great solicitation, for that justice & liberality which the gov" has extended to other Indian nations—In order to preserve a good understanding with Indians in Florida, between them and the settlers about to remove in their country and to carry into effect the views & instructions of the government of the United States relative to the Indians in Florida—allow me to suggest, that an Agent should be authorized &
appointed for the Seminole & other nations of Indians in Florida, and also a Sub-Agent for the same nation & Indians—
And, as the duties of this agency will be, among other things, to collect together the scattered bands, to extinguish the Seminole title to most of the lands, and to use, in the best possible manner, every means that shall tend to make them cultivors assisted by their slaves—
it should be made independant of any other Agency or Superintendancy that is or may be established, except the head of the War department, or a branch of that dep"having the charge of Indians Affairs generally—

<docbody>HON” JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Secretary of State.
SIR, I have had the honour, of recieving thro’ your department the commission of J. C. Bronaugh & others, as members of the Legislative Council for the Territory of Florida,” as also a letter from you of the sixth of May last " informing me that the Laws of the United States had been directed to me and sent on by the mail, as soon as they are received it will be acknowledged." But five members of the Legislative Council, have as yet, appeared so no business can be done until a majority shall assemble. I fear that the Members from East Florida will not attend; The compensation can be no Inducement. I
hope, however, the desire to render some service to Florida may influence their attendance—The Legislative Council should have assembled by the Law creating it * on the 10" Ins'. I wish you to say whether the Council, under the Law, (when they shall meet)
can from that time continue in session two months or must the time be calculated from the 2" Monday in June as fixed by Law? The Government-house & the few public buildings, which belong to this City are in possession of the Military. These are necessary for Legislative, Executive & Judicial purposes otherwise, the expence of the necessary buildings for these purposes must be incured—I think it proper to state, that in my opinion the military ought not to be stationed in the heart of this City—One company would be sufficient for any purpose of the Government at this point, and that company
<pb#491 />
should be Subject to the orders and controle of the Governor, so that he could at all times use them tise thena without application to the commanding officer, to preserve the order & peace of the City—The troops now occupy four buildings in the heart of the City—surely it would be best for discipline of the army that the troops would be removed from a City where they can so easily find means and opportunity to mingle in the dissipation common to all towns. The public buildings in this City I hope will be given up for the use of the City &
Territory until Congress shall dispose of them otherwise—There are no funds here to meet any of the expenditures of the Legislative Council—to provide and furnish a house for their use—to pay for printing the Laws and for the Stationary and Clerk hire &c—I would be glad to know if any provision was made to meet these expences, and if so, how far I may be authorized to contract or make engagements for these objects—It will readily occur to you Sir, That nearly one year must elapse before a revenue to meet the local expences of the Government here can be collected-In the mean time without some advances from the General Government, serious inconvenience &
real evil must be the consequence—
I pray you Sir, to lay before the President this letter and to give me such information & directions as he or you may deem advisable—
making them so specifick that I can avoid any errors which might tend either to embarrass the Government, or myself"—

<docbody>HON” JOHN C. CALHOUN, Secretary at War The Indians in the Territory of Florida are very uneasy. They are not apprised who is their agent, and they are wandering over the Country in every direction. They are in a wretched State, many of them have lost their Crops this Season by the overflowing of the Rivers & Creeks. As I am not advised of my powers & duties as superintendant of Indian affairs, I should be thankful to recieve from you such Instructions as you deem necessary—If the Indians come to this place as, I expect they will on hearing of my arrival what Shall I Say to them as to the Tract of Country it is probable they will
<pb#492 />
occupy and in what manner and to what amount are they to be furnished with rations? for I am confident they are in a starving condition—
The military at this place are in possession of all the public buildings which are much wanted for the use of the City and Territory—I have made no application to the commanding officer to give up any part of the buildings; Because I do not like to incommode the Troops at this Season of the year. I have, however, written to Mr Adams" on this Subject, and wish the order of the Government, to take possession of the buildings which if obtained shall not be used hastily, so as to occaison any dissatisfaction in the army—The troops except one company ought not to remain in the heart of the City—if no other reason existed for their removal than that the order and dicipline of the Troops; can never in a City be preserved in the same degree that, will be found in the same troops removed from its temptations &
pleasures.
If one company was kept in this City, Subject to the command of the Governor to preserve its Order and Harmoney it would be Sufficient—
The remarks are not made, but with the view only to calling your attention to this Subject. Individually no man in the nation feels more respect, than myself for the Honor & Interest of the Army"—
Your obedient Servant -
If you wish the troops still to occupy the Goverment House and other buildings your order to the quartermaster here to rent a house for Executive office and Legislative counsel will answer every purpose *
YOur Obnt Serv't Wm P. DUVAL
[Endorsed] An Inventory of the public buildings at Pensacola if any was furnished by the Spanish authority to Gen' Jackson, has not as yet reached us.—I was there in 1818, but do not at this time know much in relation to them. There were then an old frame government House as it was called, a range of old Barracks, and five or Six Small block Houses, which latter constituted the defense of the place.
The Barracks have subsequently (last fall) been consumed by fire—
The troops are quartered in the block Houses and we rent quarters for several officers—The residue of the officers perhaps occupy the buildings which Gov. DuVal refers to—Which they are, or how extensive, I cannot say—He cannot, in speaking of the removal of the troops have reference to the Block Houses I apprehend, for however favorable their location, they cannot in my view be advantageously used for civil purposes. In the absence of a plan of the place, shewing as well

the locality, as the number & description of the public Buildings, it is impracticable to make any thing like a sensible distribution of them among the civil & military departments—I would therefore respectfully suggest its delay til the necessary information can be obtained—
An officer of the 4 Reg" now at Baltimore can probably afford it—
if not it can in the course of two months be obtained from Pensacola.

<docbody>SIR, In addressing you on a subject that I conceive to be of Vital importance, to the present tranquility prosperity & happiness, of this interesting Section of our Country—which has been newly acquired by, & will at no distant period of time, form the brightest epoch in yours, or any other administration—I do so with confidence, knowing that I am not only addressing the Chief Magistrate, of the freeest &
greatest republic on earth—but am addressing a man eminent for his devotedness to true republican principle, the best interest of our happy Country, & to the Constitution of the U. S. & at the same time, one who is preeminently qualified, to give to that Ark of American liberty, a fair clear & sound interpretation—Believing that the above remarks will be a sufficient apoligy for obtruding myself on your time, I will proceed to Submit to you, a few questions, which are likely to grow out of the peculiar, & I might with truth say, distracted State of things in this Territory—Have the officers & soldiers of the U. S.
Army, a right to vote in any State or Territory (other than the one in which they originally resided or were enlisted) for a Representative, or Delegate in Congress?—How far would the true interest of the Service, & the Country justify a Commanding officer of a Reg" or Post, in preventing his Camp or Garrison from becoming a scene of electioneering intrigue & disipation—At this time, there are nearly two Regiments of U. S. Troops stationed in Florida—& you will readily perceive that in a Territory as thinly settled as this is, that it will be in the power of the Troops (if so disposed) to elect whom they please as the Delegate to represent this Territory—But can a Deligate, so elected, be said to represent the free & independent voters, & the true interest of this Territory—The Common soldiers have no interest in the soil, nor can they have any interest in the future advancement, & prosperity of the Territory—for one week after the election takes place, they may be ordered to N. York or to Green Bay—& of course will feel no interest in the future destinies of the Section of Country they have left.—I will state one case more—Suppose for
<pb#494 />
instance, the Soldiers were to take it into their heads, to elect one of their most popular sergts. or privates, to represent this Territory as Delegate in Congress—would this election disolve his engagement with the U.S. or would he not subject himself to be tried & punished as a deserter, were he to presume on his previledge as a Delegate, &
leave his camp, or Garrison, without permission.—Admit the principle, that soldiers have the right of voting in whatever Territory they may be stationed in, & a case similar to the one above stated may occur.—
I have been 14 years in the service of my Country, during which time, I have never knowing or intentionally deviated from what I concieve to be the true spirit & Meaing of the Constitution, or from the orders, or views of the Executive of the U. S. & I hope you will do me the justice to believe, that I am impell'd alone by Motives of the same kind, in addressing you at this time.—Your attention to this subject,”

In making out his account, he has charged Three Dollars per day but will be satisfied with any compensation which the Secretary may think proper to allow him. He states that the duties which he had to perform as translator and Interpreter interfered much with his regular business, and that although he was not constantly engaged in the performance of those duties, yet that he at all times held himself in readiness to act when called upon. Col: Walton will explain to you the extent of the duties which he rendered. As M*Alba is the only one of the old Inhabitants, who has been employed by the Government here, I think it will be good policy to make him a liberal allowance for his services. You will confer a favor upon him by laying his account before M*Adams and sending him addressed to this place a Draft for the amount which he may allow—He will prefer a draft upon New Orleans.

[Enclosure: DS]
Memorial to the President from Escambia County Court Justices
[June 25, 1822]
To his Excellency James Monroe, President of the United States, The Memorial of David Shannon, Presiding Judge, and John W.
Garnier, and E. B. Foster, Associate Justices of the County Court of Escambia, in West Florida, respectfully represents:
That your Memorialists were appointed on the establishment of the County Court by His Excel Governor Jackson, and have ever since (now nearly ten months) continued to discharge the duties of their respective Offices. That nearly the whole of the business of the Court has devolved upon them, one of their Associates having died shortly after his appointment, another having attended but once or twice since his appointment, and the other, M. Cary Nicholas, having been subsequently appointed, sat but two or three terms.
Your memorialists further represent, that all the judicial power of the Province, excepting in small cases before justices of the Peace, and in cases of appeal to the Governor, centered in the County Court;—that this Court, which sat monthly, was generally engaged from one to two weeks in hearing civil and criminal causes which arose in the County, and in superintending all matters of police out of the city; that the Presiding Justice was daily called upon to make orders according to the Spanish practice in the commencement and the progress of suits;—that there being no power in the Province to levy a tax to support the necessary expences of the local government, Your memorialists were allowed certain fees to be taxed in the causes brought before them, but which have been found very inadequate to compensate them for their services: the whole amount received by the Presiding Judge being little more than one hundred Dollars, and by each of the other memorialists not more than half that sum:—
that the discharge of these duties of primary importance in the Province by the Memorialists has greatly interfered with their private concerns, and caused them much personal inconvenience and loss of time.
They therefore humbly hope that the President, taking their case into consideration, will allow them a reasonable compensation, out of the fund placed at his disposal in the act of the 3" of March 1821, providing for the occupation and temporary government of the Floridas—the services rendered by Your Memorialists having been indispensably necessary to the good government of the same.

<place-time>PENSACOLA July 7" 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR/I now forward in pursuance of your intimation,” the accounts of my necessary expenditures while acting Governor of West Florida, with such vouchers as I have been enabled to procure.
The enclosed letters of Col° Fenwick and Capt" Thornton are intended as explanatory of the charge for house rent paid Antoine Collins and Antonio Molino. This subject has been already explained by me to the Department of State.
I have left blank the charge for extra services rendered, and expenses incurred by me while Acting Governor of this Province. In several of my letters to M' Adams, I have taken occasion to explain myself on this subject.” I throw myself entirely upon the justice and liberality of the President. When it is considered that my situation of Acting Governor was materially different from that of Secretary, I flatter myself that my claim will not be considered as unreasonable. As Acting Governor I was unavoidably compelled to see many strangers, and it was but decent, and proper, that some civilities should be shewn them. My actual expenses were at least treble what they would have been, had I continued to exercise only the Office of Secretary. The expense of living is even greater here than at New Orleans; and besides, the example of General Jackson, who was remarkable for hospitality, rendered it almost impossible for me to pursue a course entirely different, without giving offence, and even without lessening the respect for the Station, at a period when many circumstances combined to render it necessary that it
<pb#502 />
should be maintained. I have observed the strictest economy in every thing which might become a charge on the Government; instead of renting an Office distinct from the House in which I live, I have made one of the rooms in it serve the purpose, not a little to the inconvenience of my family.”
In addition to what I have just mentioned, I trust the President will take into consideration the various and troublesome duties which were devolved upon me, (according to the existing Spanish Laws and usages) while in the exercise of the Government—Upon the whole I
feel confident the President will be of opinion that an allowance for extra services, while exercising the Government, is but reasonable.”
I have the honor to be Very Respectfully, Sir Your most Obdt Serv't GEO. WALTON
To FONTAINE MAURY Esq". Department of State Washington.

SIR In compliance with your request, that I would state to you the Amount that it would have cost the Government of the United States to have Rented Quarters for the Officers and Troops of the Army, who have been quartered in the House, and buildings attached thereto—known as the Government House—in Pensacola: I state, that to have Rented Quarters, for the Officers, the Non Com" Staff, and Music of the 4" Reg Infº, who have been quartered in the Buildings alluded to, at the rate which we have been compeled to pay for the Rent of other Quarters for Officers who could not be accommodated with Public Quarters, it would have cost the Government at a moderate calculation, $80.00 per month.
We have occupied these Quarters, since the occupation of this Post by our Troops in July 1821.

<docbody>SIR, We have received our Commissions as Commissioners “for ascertaining claims and titles to land within the territories of Florida”,”
of which you will receive this notification as an acceptance. Colo.
Preston has not yet reached Pensacola, nor have we received any intelligence of him upon which we can predicate any confident calculations as to his arrival.” A Board has, however, been formed, and we shall proceed on to-morrow in the execution of our duties.
32 Not found.
<pb#505 />
For many documents which would have shed, it is presumed, much light upon the claims submitted for adjudication, we feel ourselves greatly at a loss. It is doubtful whether we shall be enabled to procure an authentic copy of the treaty between Spain and Great Britain in '83, unless it should be exhibited by the claimants themselves.
There are no other means within our reach of obtaining the English statutes making compensation to her citizens for lands, upon their removal from this country, in consequence of a change of government.
Even a copy of the land laws, published by the authority of Congress, have not yet been transmitted to us, nor have we received any assurances that such will be the fact. In a territory so remote, and where libraries are very limitted, we shall be necessarily subjected to great difficulty in procuring those means of information, and in some cases, it is to be feared, we shall not succeed at all.
Under such circumstances, we respectfully suggest to you the propriety of having forwarded to the Commissioners all documents filed in the different departments, touching the adjudication of land claims in this territory, and which would afford any facilities in enabling us to distinguish private property from that which rightfully belongs to the United States. We have understood that there is a British plat of the town of Pensacola in the Secretary of State's office, which it might be of importance we should have in our possession; as also a plan of St. Augustine, if to be found amongst the public archives.
Believing that most of the vouchers referred to are within the controul of the Secretary of State, we have addressed you this communication, submitting its propriety entirely to your determination.”—

Not having received any of these publications of the Laws, since I have been in Office, may I take the liberty to call your attention to the Subject, and to beg you to give directions that they may be Sent to me?

P. S. I take the liberty to mention, with great respect, that Col.
Smith, appointed to the office of Judge of the Territorial Court here;"
and who was, by law, to open his Court on the first Monday of this month, has not yet reached this place, and that information has lately been received here, stating that he did not intend to come ’till next Fall: This circumstance has occasioned very general dissatisfaction in this Country. A Judge is indeed, much wanted here. The County Court established by the ordinances of Governor Jackson, has ceased to exist. There has been no Court held here for some time past. Two of the County Judges have resigned and the other three live at a considerable distance in the Country and do not intend to hold any more Courts, having doubts as to their powers. Nor is there any Marshall or Sheriff here. Mr Worthington, lately appointed to the former office," h(as] left this place, with his family, for Maryland, without having appointed any deputy—and the Sheriff” having been appointed one of the Legislative Council has gone to Pensacola.”

<docbody>HIS EXCY WILLIAM P. DUVALL GOV of Florida Pensacola SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 21" ulto;”
and in reply to that part, which relates to the distribution of the publick buildings at Pensacola among the Civil and Military, I have to remark, that not having received an Official Inventory of those buildings as handed over by the Spanish authorities, it is impracticable for the Government to direct a particular division of them between the two Departments of Service. Relying therefore on your friendly disposition towards the Army, and believing that you will require such buildings only, as are indispensable for, and will best answer civil purposes, I have instructed the commanding Officer of the troops, Col. Clinch to arrange such a division with you as will be satisfactory.
I enclose a copy of my letter to Col. Clinch.
In relation to that part of your letter requesting instructions relative to your “powers and duties as Superintendent of Indian Affairs” I must refer you to my letter of the 11" ultimo,” which it is presumed you have received before this time. As it relates to the location of the Indians, it is the intention of the Department to locate them in the fall in some favorable position in the Northern part of East Florida near the Appalachacola. The enclosed copy of a letter to Captain Morris of the 28" May last " in relation to the issue of rations will give you the views of the Department on that subject.
Copies of the instructions to your predecessor relative to Indian Affairs will be transmitted to you as soon as they can be made out.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the Commission to Greenberry Gaither * and George Murray * Esqr"—Mess Law, Reynolds, Hanham and Gaither, sailed from St Augustine about 59
days since for this port.” Ten days ago they were hailed by the Brig Hero off this port, but before they could pass the bar, a violent storm arose, which lasted three days—several vessels have been wrecked on Horn Island, off Mobile Point, whose crews and passengers were saved—The Lady Washington, the Sloop in which the gentlemen of the Counsel sailed, has never been heard of since. I have but little doubt the Sloop and every soul perished—I have lost a brotherin-law M'. Hynes "who was also a passenger, if the vessel has foundered. This will be a serious misfortune to our Territory, To this circumstance, we have not been able to form a Quorum to do business.
M” Henry M. Brackenridge, having accepted the Office of Judge under the United States,” has resigned his seat in the Council, as well as M. Joseph M. White,” who is appointed Secretary to the board of Commissioners, two of whom are now doing business here. In the
<pb#510 />
place of these Gentlemen, I recommend Mess” John de la Rua and Joseph Noriega,” two of the Spanish inhabitants of this place, who are men of information and integrity, and are looked up to by the Spanish population as their first men here. Judge Brackenridge, D” Bronaugh, M Walton the Secretary and myself all concur in wishing them to be appointed of the Council. This would have an excellent effect in attaching the Spanish inhabitants to our Government; I have found those people much more orderly than the Americans who are here, and I do not believe I ever have seen a more moral or better people, they can be easily governed, if treated with kindness and confidence. If the President and yourself will second me in my efforts, I think you will soon see a happy union among the People of Florida.
As it is the general impression that our Members of the Council from East Florida are lost, would it not be best to send on a Commission appointing others, which should be void in the event of their arrival here.
I have not heard one word of Mess" Gibson, Macon, or Lytle—
great inconvenience is felt here for want of the Council. There are but three of the Council now here, & seven are required to make a majority."

<docbody>SIR. I had the honor of receiving by the last mail your letter of instructions on Indian Affairs, dated the 11* day of June last,”
together with the several Acts of Congress for the regulation of trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes. I shall be careful in not exceeding in manner the expenses set apart by you for the Florida Indians, and in all cases, shall submit to your directions, without pretending to judge of the effects they may produce. The Indian Agent has not yet reported himself. It is desirable he should be among the Indians with as little delay as possible—The Indians in Florida are in a wretched state, not Knowing what part of the Country will be claimed by the United States, or what section they will ultimately be allowed to occupy. The Indians raised little er Hething during the last year and I fear they will raise for their subsistence still less the present Season. Such is their distress that they have dug up miles of the Country in order to procure the brier root to subsist on. If the Government intend to give them any support in their present distressed situation, the amount allowed to be distributed in rations, will amount to very little.
It is important to locate the Indians speedily, whether we regard their comfort and happiness—or the interests of the United States—
The various claims of individuals to grants of Land in almost every part of Florida, Keeps the Indians in continual alarm—The settlers are crowding in their claims to the lands promiscuously, and fixing their habitations where they choose; I Know the people may be removed by Military force but until some tract of Country is allotted to the Indians, to remove them they must be driven out of the Territory.
The sooner Gen' Jackson's talk" with them can be carried into effect by the Government, the better—and I cannot forbear urging
<pb#512 />
this measure as one of vital importance to the interests of Florida.
I will thank you to transmit to me the documents laid before Congress at the Session, containing the accounts and settlements of the several Superintendants and Indian Agents with your department.
If the Military force in Florida were employed in opening a road from this place to St Augustine, it would be of great importance; in case of war, it would be absolutely necessary.”

N° 238. Grants of Lands in Florida by the King of Spain Office of the Attorney Gen' of the U. States July 19–1822
SIR. My answer to your communication of the 3" " has been delayed by absence from the city, to which I have just returned.
Doctor England states the law correctly. There can be no doubt of the power of the King of Spain to grant lands in Florida while the Province was his; nor of the capacity of the Roman Catholic Church to take by grant. Our treaty with Spain recognizes and ratifies all such grants made prior to a certain day.
The only question in this case is a question of fact. Did the King of Spain grant these lands to the Roman Catholic Church prior to the time stipulated? on this, which is the only question in the case, there is no evidence before me. If it is intended that I am to take Doctor England's statement of facts as correct, I am of the opinion that he is right in his conclusions of law: if otherwise, it will be necessary that I shall be furnished with a report of the facts, which, I
presume, the attorney for the U. S. for the territory of Florida can readily furnish; or the whole subject can be remitted to that officer"
for his opinion, which, I would respectfully submit, is the better course, because the evidence is more easily accessible to him, and because the archives of that province will give him a better understanding

<place-time>PENSACOLA July 22nd 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>THE HON. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Secretary of State—
SIR, Some time since a memorial was forwarded to the President by myself as Presiding Justice of Escambia County, and John Garnier and E. B. Foster associate Justices, praying for some compensation for our Judicial labours"—Since which time I have understood from Mr. Murry," who has just arrived here from Washington, that five dollars per day have been allowed him as Presiding Justice of St.
John's county. For the purpose of enabling the President to fix my compensation, I take the liberty of stating that I received my commission from Governor Jackson on the 24th day of July 1821, and have Continued in the exercise of the duties of my office ever since.”
TNA (WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 4), instructing that rent should not exceed
$12 per month per room, and that it would be proper to take a whole building in which quarters could be allotted to officers according to rank and allowances.
<pb#514 />
On the arrival of Governor Duval I waited upon him and tendered my resignation, but at his earnest solicitation, and to prevent the confusion which might have been produced by the want of a judicial tribunal in the country, I agreed to continue until the legislature should act upon the subject, or until the arrival of the United States Judge. The legislature have not yet met, but will do so in a few days when a reorganization of the County Court will take place.
The duties enjoined by the ordinance of Governor Jackson * have required my constant and undivided attention. The mode of proceeding by concilliation which took place before me as presiding justice out of court was preserved.” It was also my duty at all times, to make all orders which might be required at the commencement and in the progress of any suit. Hence I was always liable, and was almost daily called on, to hear parties and make such orders as might be required in the progress of causes. The duies of the associate Justices were confined to the time when the Court was actually in session, which upon reference to the record I find to be fifty seven days.
When the President takes into consideration the critical period at which I entered upon the duties of my office, and the great labour and responsibility attending the discharge of those duties, the sacrifices which I have made and the privations which I have endured, in indeavouring to sustain the character of the Judiciary, I feel the utmost confidence that in fixing my compensation, he will do me ample justice. I have the vanity to believe that my exertions to maintain the character of the Court, and to preserve good order in the Province, have not been altogether fruitless, and that the part which I have acted has not been less useful to the Territory, or creditable to myself, than that pursued by Judge Fromentin; and yet he has been in the receipt of a respectable salary, while I have received little or nothing.
The President need not be alarmed at my claim, as I know of none other in this Territory which can come against the government, excepting a small one of the county attorney. Our county expenses have been small, and defrayed by fines and forfeitures—a tax on original process, and on licenses to retail spiritous liquors, which was usual under the Spanish Government.
I have been thus particular in explaining the grounds and enforcing the justice of my Claim, because I have more than once before applied and received no answer.
<pb#515 />
I have the honor to be Your ob" Servt.

<place-time>ST. AUGUSTINE, 23* July 1822–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR—I have the honor to submit to you copies of a communication addressed to me by Capt. Pelham. Sub-agent of Indian affairs, & of my reply to it.—In consenting to charge myself with the temporary direction of the affairs of the Indians in this neighbourhood, I have been influenced solely by a desire to relieve Capt. Pelham from the anxiety of a vexatious business, to which his infirm health is wholly incompetent. He informs me that he has never received one line of instructions for his guidance either from your Department, or from M’ Worthington the late acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs.—
Capt. Bell, whom I have consulted, & who not long since was charged with the direction of the Florida-Indians, is also unable to give me any positive information of the views & wishes of the government respecting these concerns. At present considerable anxiety exists among the white people, who are desirous either to trade with the Indians, or to establish plantations on the Spanish Grants in the interior part of the Country. Some little fermentation has also been excited among the Indians. Several white persons have already applied to me to grant them passports to proceed to the Indian settlements on different pretexts. I have however declined any interference on these points, until I receive instructions on the subject—From the best information I can obtain there is not at this time a single licensed trader in East Florida, & in consequence, many of the Indians are compelled to bring their skins, & other articles of trade to this place;
& here they are abundantly supplied with spirituous liquor. For there is no municipal regulation to prohibit it, &, even if there were, the civil authorities of this City lack the power to enforce it. The magistrates have already twice, within few weeks, required the aid of the military force to enable their Constables to arrest single individuals. I have been informed that an unlicensed trader, by the name of Craig, has established himself on M"Hardy's "... plantation at
<pb#516 />
Tomoca," (Where he has collected a considerable number of Indians)
& that his whole stock in trade consists of Tobacco & Rum.
Under these circumstances I have considered it my duty to solicit of you, as early as possible, definite answers to the subjoined queries.
Perhaps I ought rather to have submitted these questions to Governor DuVal, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, But we have not been informed of his arrival at Pensacola, & the circuitous route of the mail would prevent a reply being received from him, even if he be there, in less than two months. In order therefore to relieve the extreme impatience of those, who are interested in the decision on these questions, I seek their solution at the source of information.
1* Qu. Do the laws of the U. S. regulating trade & intercourse with the Indians apply with full force to the territory of Florida? If yea, what portion of the territory is to be considered “Indian Country”
within the purview of the laws?
2* Is any person, save the Superintendent, & the Agent of Indian affairs, duly appointed, authorized to grant licences to trade, or passports to go to the Indian settlements?
3" Are the Spanish & other foreign inhabitants of this territory to be considered, as “citizens of the U.S.” de facto by merely taking the oath of allegiance; or must they undergo the probation prescribed by the naturalization law?
4* Are settlers to be permitted to establish themselves under colour of Spanish Grants, within the Indian Boundary, as said to have been recognized by the British & Spanish Authorities in Florida? If so, how far may they be permitted to buy & sell with the Indians without license? The settlements at Alachua,” Volusia,” Hope-Hill” &c &c are within this boundary.
5* In the event of white people committing offences, or becoming mischievous & troublesome in the Indian-country, can they be removed, & by what process?
6* Can the Florida Indians be permitted to sell their Horses Cattle
& Negroes? If yea, under what restrictions?—
7* Contracts are said to have been made with the Indians, before the cession of the territory, for the purchase of negroes, which have not yet been paid for, or delivered—Can these alledged contracts now be completed?
8* If an Indian Boundary be recognized in Florida, may the Indians be restrained from passing it, & in case of violation by an Indian, how is he to be punished?
77 East of St. Johns River, in Volusia County.
<pb#517 />
9* In case it should be necessary to hold intercourse with the Indians or to send a messenger to their habitations, how is the expense of the interpreter, or messenger to be defrayed?
10* Under what circumstances, & to what amount are rations to be issued to the Indians? "

Capt. Bell has declined this arrangement, & has stated his reasons to the Secretary of War.”
You, Sir, were pleased a short time since to express your willingness to transact such business as might become necessary in relation to the Indians during my contemplated absence. And being now on the point of sailing for Charleston, I beg your permission to transfer to your direction such duties in relation to the Indians as have been in my charge.
The infirm state of my health prevents my waiting upon you in person, but am ready to furnish you with any information I possess on this subject.
I would however beg leave to remark that Cap" Bell has collected more facts, & is probably much better informed as to the State of Indian Affairs in Florida than myself.

requesting me to take the direction of the affairs of the Indians, during your contemplated absence, or until the arrival of Col. Humphreys.
It would have been more satisfactory to me, if, according to the apparent intention of the Sec of War, Capt. Bell could have been induced to take charge of these concerns. But as he has declined doing so, I
can have no hesitation in entering into any arrangement, which will relieve you from the burden of business, & enable you to leave this place & seek the restoration of your health.
I therefore cheerfully comply with your request that I will take charge of the Indian-affairs in this neighbourhood, in the hope &
expectation that very little, if any, positive interference will be found necessary.”

<docbody>SIR, Mr John Copinger Connor who has discharged the laborious duties of Clerk of the Executive Court, has requested me to represent his case to the President. I fear I have already been extremely troublesome and I assure you this will be the last claim I shall forward to the Department M* Connor is a meritorious young man, who has been extremely useful both to General Jackson and myself, being an excellent Clerk, his services were put in requisition on numerous occasions where he could not be compensated as Clerk of the Executive Court Up to the period when he was appointed Clerk of the Executive Court by General Jackson M* Connor was allowed three dollars per day. From that time his services were almost continually required as a Coppying & extra Clerk, his duties as Clerk of the Executive Court, were extremely arduous. The whole amount he has received since his appointment has been about two hundred dollars for the services of about ten months, say from the 28* Aug" 1821 to the 20"
June 1822. I merely state the facts of the Case for the Consideration of the President; and have done so with great reluctance from unwillingness to incourage any further claim against Government from this province. I have been induced to make this statement from the esteem I intertain for M.

<place-time>PENSACOLA 34 August 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. I have the honor to transmit to you, a talk which I lately held with two Chiefs of Florida, Blunt" and Tus-Ki-har-gi.
You will see from the enclosed that the Indians are becoming restless, and they complain that General Jackson's promises to them have not been executed. The death of the two men who have been murdered by the Indians, will (among the remote settlers,) occasion some apprehension—I therefore demanded their surrender; which the two Chiefs promised speedily to attend to, and effect.
Stephen Richards the interpreter is a man of good character and well qualified for his situation, he was employed by General Jackson during the time he held the government here, and visited Pensacola several times with the Chiefs who came to see and talk with the general.
he states that no compensation was ever made to him for his services, although he was assured by General Jackson that he should be paid.—M Richards has presented his account, which is enclosed to you—I have on full consideration appointed a meeting with the Indians at the Post of St Marks on the 20th day of next November;
this I was convinced was necessary in order to Keep them quiet until you should have time to direct such measures as you may deem proper, and to prepare for the meeting. I cannot too strongly press on you the importance of speedily acting definitively with the Indians.
They are represented to me as being in a famishing condition, scattered over Florida, unwilling to make any improvements least they should be compelled to surrender them. I cannot avoid, consistent with my duty, urging that a more liberal allowance for rations and presents
<pb#522 />
ought to be made than that specified in your instructions to me on this subject. If the Chiefs and their warriors should assemble in November at St Marks, the amount allowed for rations, in this Southern Country where every article sells at a double price, would not feed them three days. The Indian Chief Blunt, with whose character you are no doubt acquainted, acted as a guide to Gen' Jackson during the Seminole War, and states that the General promised he should have a pension for his services. I have spoken with Capt" Call, one of the General's aids, on this subject, and he confirms Blunt's statement. This Chief has requested me to write to you on this subject and learn whether General Jackson ever urged his claim on the Government, and if so whether any compensation or pension will be granted to him for his services—Blunt is a candid, and honest man.
The funds intended for the Indians in Florida should be forwarded as early as convenient, as the articles intended as presents will have to be purchased in New Orleans—they cannot be procured here.
Blunt has made a proposal—which he requested I would communicate to the President—it is to mark out a road from Pensacola to St Augustine. the nearest and best route, and he is of opinion that a good road may be made between the two Cities not exceeding 400
miles—
I have understood from the members of the Council from East Florida that Col: Eustis is willing to be ordered to open a road, and Col: Clinch who commands at this Post is equally anxious to assist in the undertaking. A Military road connecting the two extremes of Florida would be highly important in any future war, and would greatly add to the value of the public lands through which it must pass.”

[July . . . 1822]
TERRITORY OF FLORIDA City of Pensacola On the 25" & 26" day of July 1822 Blunt and, Tus:ki,har,jo or Cotharn called on me at my executive Chamber & Stated to me by their Interpreter, Stephen Richards, that the Indians were becoming restless, with the uncertainty of their Situation, That Gen' Jackson in his talk with them in September last, promised that in a few months the place or land intended for the Florida Indians should be marked out for them, that they have waited a long time, and yet nothing has been done, that they wish to know when their Father the President would determine where they were to live—That White men were settling in and near their Towns which they did not like–That two men, named, Cap"W" B. Crowder, one Gilstrap had been murdered on the East side of the Suwany Bay in April last, by W* Bowles, a half Indian, Ill,la-toa-ka & others. They also desired to know if I
had any information for them from the Great Father, The President On the 28* Ins" the two Chiefs attended and heard my talk which was as follows:—Brothers, I am glad to see you, But I am sorry your Great Father has not yet directed me where you are to live—I look every day now when the President will send me his orders and then I
will send you word. I know the talk which Gen' Jackson delivered to you last September, that was a plain & Strait talk, and I hope your Great Father the President; has harkened to Gen' Jackson's words and will soon send me his orders what to do for you. Brothers our chiefs at Washington are few, that do all the business of the Great American nation. They cannot do. every thing quick—that would be more than any men could do—but be patient, all that is right, will be done for you in good time—Keep your People Strait, do not let bad men come among you, nor trust to bad counsel—for that will bring evil and distress on you. I am sorry Brothers, that Billy Bowles.
Ill-la, too,ka, and others should be so bad as to murder Cap" W" B.
Crowder and Gilstrap—This was done in cold blood and they must be delivered to the commanding officer at the post of St Marks—this is what your Great Father the President will expect, and if it is not done his warriors will soon raise the hatchet. If a white man murders a red man the white man must suffer death, so all shall be fair and strait—bad men white or red must be punished so is the rule or law of all nations, Such is the law of your Great Father the President Brothers we want to live with you in peace, and I will make our white men behave themselves or I will punish them. Brothers I will send you the Agent, if I cannot go myself to meet all your Cheifs at the Post of St Marks on the 20" day of next November, if the Agent
<pb#524 />
should not come to see you at that time I will send some person that will inform you what the President shall direct—If your Chiefs will have all the slaves belonging to the white men who have run away to Florida brought to to the Post of St Marks you shall have what is right for bringing us in the Negroes, I will see that you shall be paid for your time and trouble, be active in bringing to the Post of St.
Marks all the Slaves that you can find Brothers, hear me, be patient and live in peace until I send you word—This I will do, you need not travel so far, on uncertainty M" Richards shall have word from me and he will tell you what is to be done.

yet my sacrafices have been greater in this last Tour than I calculated.
So much so, that not only not the Marshalship, but not even the certainty of a seat in Congress as Delegate (of which had I remained there, I have not the smallest doubt) would justify my returning there, for some time.—
I wish it to be distinctly understood; that altho', I now am again a private citizen, I always hold myself ready & willing to serve my Country in any fit capacity where I can be of benefit to her, either at home or abroad, to the extent of my humble abilities & with that industry integrity & honor, at which, I have ever aimed, both in my private & public life—

<docbody>JAMES MONROE President of the United States SIR By the Act of Congress providing for the Government of Florida, the Governor of this Territory is directed to publish the Laws which shall be enacted by the Legislative Council throughout the Territory;” this it will be impossible to do, for want of funds, unless authorized by you. I presume that Congress intended to meet this expense, or they would not have directed the Governor to publish the Laws.
The Collector of this port, M. Scott has utterly refused to make any provision for the sick seamen & sailors who arrive here, although the fund for this purpose is overflowing, alledging that he has no power to act or to make such provision—
In consequence of his refusing to give any assistance in such cases, humanity has compelled me to have the sick sailors and Seamen provided for, I hope Sir, you will order the Collector to refund to this City, the money which, under my orders, the Mayor has ad-

vanced for this object, and also give directions to the Collector to provide for this class of valuable citizens in future; The Spanish inhabitants of this Territory seem much better reconciled than heretofore—they are certainly a good, quiet, and orderly people, much more so than our own population.
I hope that the Government of the United States will act towards them with the same liberality, that was extended to Louisiana The majority of the Legislative Council, eight only being present are actively engaged in preparing a Code of Laws for the Territory.”

EXCy Wm P. DUVALL Pensacola SIR, Your letter of the 18" Ultimo has been received."
The Indian Agent has been ordered to repair to Florida immediately and report himself to you for instructions. A copy of the order is enclosed."
The Department has never had but one view in relation to the Indians of Florida, that is, that they should join the Creek Indians in Georgia, which will appear by the papers enclosed to you with my letter of the 23" Ultimo,” but it was found that the people of Georgia had insuperable objections to this arrangement, and in consequence of which it was not deemed desirable to take any Steps for effecting it, without an express act of Congress authorising the measure. The next view was to concentrate them in Florida, and measures were accordingly taken last fall by Captain Bell who then acted as temporary agent for Indian Affairs to concentrate them at the point designated by Genl Jackson, in his letter of the 20" September 1821 *
(of which an extract is enclosed) but these measures were defeated by the refusal of the Indians to meet Capt" Bell at the time appointed.
The Subject would have been resumed this Spring, but the appropria-
<pb#529 />
tion was not made until too late in the Season to hold a treaty in a climate so warm and sickly and where too the Indians were supposed to be engaged in making their crops. The season of the year now approaches when these objections will not exist, and as soon as the Indian Agent arrives, you will cause the Indians to be assembled without delay, and final arrangements made with them for their concentration at the point proposed. The means for conciliating the Indians and facilitating the accomplishment of the object of the meeting are already in the Indian Country (as you will observe by the enclosed extract of a letter from Capt Bell) and orders have been given to Capt" Bell to place these means at your disposal, and also to deliver over to your order the sum of $298,34/100 which remains in his hands, to be applied to the same object, if it should be necessary.
Any further funds that may be necessary to meet the expenses of your superintendency, will be remitted to you from the Treasury, as you have heretofore been apprized, upon your quarterly estimates, as soon as they are received at this Department.
It is not in my power to transmit to you, agreeably to your request, the documents laid before Congress containing the accounts of the several superintendents and agents of Indian Affairs, as there is no spare copy in the Department, and they are too voluminous to be transcribed entire. If you will point out any particular part of them which you want, it shall be extracted and transmitted to you. I
have no doubt of the important advantages of a road from Pensacola to S*Augustine, and that the military force in Florida might be usefully employed on such a work, but as it would be attended with a considerable expense, it cannot be done without the authority of Congress."

<docbody>COL. GAD HUMPHREYS, Indian Agent, Marcellus, New York SIR, From information recently received from Florida, it appears that the presence of the Indian Agent there is indispensable; and you will make immediate arrangements for your departure for Florida.
On your arrival there, you will report yourself to the Governor at Pensacola who is acquainted with the views of the Government in relation to the Indians, and will furnish you with all necessary instructions for your government in the discharge of your duties. The Governor will also furnish you with funds to defray the expenses consequent upon your intercourse with the Indians.
14 Answered post, p. 533. See post, p. 518.

As your bond has not yet been received, you will forthwith transmit it, duly executed, to this Department, and state the probable time of your departure—Any omission, or unreasonable delay on your part, to comply with the above order, will be considered as a resignation of your office, and a new appointment will be made."

<docbody>W" P. DUVAL Esquire. Governor of Florida SIR Your Letters of the 21" and 30" of June and 17 of July"
have been received and submitted to the consideration of the President.
With regard to the occupation by the Military of the public Buildings, orders have been already transmitted from the War Department to Colonel Clinch to place them at the disposal of the Civil authority.”
With regard to the question whether the Legislative Council are authorized by the Act of Congress to Continue in Session, two months from the time of their first meeting, I presume they must have settled it upon their own view of the Law before this Letter can be received.
No appropriation having been made by Congress at thier last Session to defray the necessary expences of the territorial Government of Florida, such indispensable charges, as will not admit of delay have been, and will continue to be paid from the balance remaining of the appropriation of the preceeding year for carrying into effect the Florida Treaty.
Conformably to your Recommendation a Commission has been made out and forwarded to you for M" de la Ruca and M. Noriega as members of the Legislative Council.”

SIR, Your letter of the 23" Ultimo, enclosing a copy of a letter from Captain Pelham to you, and of your reply to the same, has been received.”
I approve of your taking charge of the affairs of the Indians during the absence of Captain Pelham, and proceed to answer, for your information and government, the several inquiries contained in your letter upon that subject in the order in which they are made.
1. The law regulating trade and intercourse is considered to apply with full force to the territory of Florida; and the boundaries established between the Indians and English and Spaniards, or which existed at the time the Floridas passed into the possession of the United States, must be taken as designating the portion of the Territory to be considered “Indian Country”—until some definitive arrangement on the subject is made.
2. The Superintendents and Agents of Indian Affairs only are authorised to issue licenses to trade with the Indians. Passports to go into the Indian Country may in certain cases, be granted by military Officers (see 3" sec: law of intercourse).”
3. The Spanish or other foreign inhabitants of the Territory of Florida, are to be considered de facto, citizens of the United States, after they have taken the oath of Allegiance, without passing thro' the formalities of the naturalization law.
4. Persons claiming title to lands, under Spanish grants, which are situated within the existing Indian boundary, will not be allowed to occupy the lands, without special permission from the government.
5. White people committing offences, or becoming mischievous or troublesome, in the Indian Country, may be removed and punished
(See 4.5.6 & 16 Sections law of intercourse.)”
6" In relation to the sale of horses, cattle, and negroes by the Indians see 10th section of the law of intercourse.”
7. As it is probable that impositions and oppressions may be attempted to be practised on the Indians under color of contracts made with them, before the session of the Territory, the persons pretending to hold such contracts will not be permitted to go into the Indian Country for the purpose of obtaining their fulfillment, except under the authority of a license from the Superintendent or Agent of Indian Affairs, to whom application must be made for that purpose.
<pb#533 />
FL OR I D A TE R R I TOR Y 513
8. An Indian is not punishable for merely crossing the boundary line into the white settlements, unless he commits offence while there
(see 14 section—Law of intercourse).”
9. Any moderate expense incurred in the necessary intercourse with the Indians will be paid by the Governor of the Territory; but as the appropriation is very limited, great care will be taken to incur as little as possible.
10" Respectable Indians visiting the post on business or otherwise, may be furnished with rations to a moderate amount—none, however ought to be issued except when they are indispensably necessary—
nor should frequent or unnecessary visits be encouraged.
I enclose herewith copies of the law of intercourse and the supplementary law passed at the late session of congress, for your information and government.
While you continue to attend to Indian Affairs, you will correspond with Gov" Duval, and keep him informed of your proceedings. The Indian Agent has been ordered to Florida, and it is expected he will relieve you from this duty in a short time.”

<place-time>PENSACOLA, August 24* 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Colo. Preston, one of the Commissioners appointed to ascertain claims and titles to land, has not yet arrived, and we have been unable, from any information which has reached us, to make any confident calculations in the subject.” It has been stated upon the credit of a letter written from Norfolk, that he will be here in the fall, and that it is expected he will be appointed the Surveyor General
<pb#535 />
of Florida. Colo. Preston, no doubt, merits any office which could be conferred upon him; but we should lament being deprived of his cooperation as a Commissioner. We also regret it, as it may produce some delay in filling his vacancy, which will have subjected two Commissioners to the performance of all the duties assigned to a full board. In order to avoid any further uncertainty and delay, and secure the cooperation of a full board, we have taken the liberty, in the event of Colo. Preston's receiving the appointment of Surveyor General, respectfully to recommend Joseph M. White of this plaice, as his successor.
M” White received an appointment as a member of the Legislative Council of Florida, and has since been elected as Secretary to the Board of Commissioners. He is well acquainted with the Spanish language, and for science and legal acquirements, possesses a highly respectable reputation. Since his arrival in Florida, he has devoted a portion of his attention to the jurisprudence of the country, and if so fortunate as to receive the appointment, would be enabled to afford to the board the most efficient assistance. From his acquaintance with the laws and ordinances of the Spanish government, we have no hesitation in saying, that he is well qualified for the station, and that his appointment would meet with the public approbation.
The utmost confidence may be reposed in his integrity, as well as in his talents, and competency to do ample justice to the United States and the claimants.—
A sincere desire that the duties which have devolved upon us should be discharged with fidelity, and the objects of our commission accomplished as speedily and successfully as possible, are the considerations which have induced us to address you upon this subject. We therefore hope, that it may not be considered as obtrusive, but as an act resulting from our best wishes to subserve the interests of the government.—
With sentiments of the highest respect, We are y. mo. obt. Serts.

<docbody>SIR. The Commissioners for the adjudication of land claims in Florida commenced their Sessien about one month since, and upon examination of the Alcalde's office, and other information furnished us, we are induced to believe that ther are not more than Sixty or Eighty original titles in West Florida, the whole of the other documents relating to the sovereignty and property of the Country, have been taken by the Spanish officers to Havana, instead of being surrendered conformably to the 8th article of the Treaty to the American commissioners, –
The late Surveyor General Don Vincente Sebastian Pintado has retained in his possession the record of his proceedings; and individual claimants are subjected, to the payment of enormous sums for copies and exemplifications,—We have no doubt that the officers of the late Government carried off those papers for the purposes of extortion and imposition.
The Commissioners are reduced to this dilema either to, receive exemplifications as conclusive evidence of title, in which case an avenue will be opened to fraud and imposition on our government in the fabrication of titles in Havana or Individual claimants injured by the rejection of those copies—We would therefore earnestly request that the most efficient measures be taken by the President to procure the originals as speedily as possible”

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR August 28* 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>GOV* WILLIAM P. DUVALL, Florida. Pensacola SIR, Your letter of the 3" instant has been received.” I approve of the measures which you have adopted upon the subject of Indian Affairs.
My letter to you of the 19th instant” will apprize you of the causes which have delayed to this period any definitive arrangement in relation to the Indians in Florida, and of the measures now proposed to be taken to effect that object. The time which you have appointed for a meeting with the Indians is a very proper one, as it will afford time for the Indian Agent to reach his post and make any preparatory arrangements which may be necessary previous to the assembling of the Indians. If it should suit you to attend the meeting as the Commissioner on the part of the United States to treat with the Indians, you are authorised to do so, and you will be allowed at the rate of $8 a day for the time you may be actually engaged on that duty, which will be paid on your certificate of honor as to the time actually engaged. If it should not be convenient for you to act, you will, as soon as practicable, name some suitable person to this Department to be appointed for that purpose, and I would suggest whether the services of Captain Bell, who from his temporary employment in the Indian Department in Florida has acquired some knowledge of the Indians could not be advantageously employed in this way.
It appears by the extract of General Jacksons letter enclosed to you with my letter of the 19* inst: that the point designated by him as the most proper for the concentration of the Indians might in some degree interfere with the grant to Forbes & Co.: If the Indian title to
<pb#539 />
FL OR I D A TERRITOR Y 519
the Country claimed by this grant has been extinguished, care must be taken in making the arrangements for the location of the Indians, not to embarrass the government by an interference with it; but if the Indian title has not been extinguished, there will be no difficulty on that score. The Commissioners appointed to settle claims to land in Florida will perhaps be able to give you satisfactory information on this subject.
I am aware that the funds assigned to your superintendency are scant, and will require the most rigid economy to render them available, even for the ordinary expenses of the Indian Department—the allowance is however as liberal for that purpose as the appropriation would admit of. An additional allowance will be made for the extra expense which it may be necessary to incur in consequence of the proposed treaty, and I have to request you will transmit to me as early as practicable an estimate of the probable amount of such expense, and if deemed reasonable funds will be forwarded to enable you to meet it.
In relation to M'. Richards the Interpreter, I enclose herewith an extract of a letter from this Department to Captain Bell, authorizing him to give M*. Richards the appointment of Interpreter with an annual compensation of $365." You will therefore settle the account of M'. Richards at this rate, and if he has not been regularly appointed an Indian Interpreter in the service of the government, you are authorized to appoint him, as one will be absolutely necessary, and he appears to be a man of good character. He will perform his duties under your directions. To enable you to pay him for past services I have directed the sum of $500 to be remitted to you, which will leave a surplus to be applied to other purposes.
In July 1818, not long after the termination of the Semenole War, the Indian Chief Blunt, to whom you refer, visited the seat of Government in company with M'. Hambly, and upon a representation of his services by General Jackson, he was allowed and paid therefor the sum of $1000, which was deemed an adequate compensation, consequently he can have no just claim now on the government for the same services.
Since my answer to you of the 19* inst in relation to your proposition for opening a road between Pensacola and S*Augustine, I have thought it probable that the expense of merely opening the road, would not be great, and if you will transmit to me an estimate of the probable amount of the cost, including the extra pay of the soldiers
(an estimate of which you may obtain from the Quarter Master) I will decide upon the subject, and apprize you of the decision."

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</dochead>
<source>[NA:SF, 17 Cong., 2 sess.: C*]</source>
<place-time>[September 2, 1822]</place-time>
<docbody>To His Excellency James Munroe President of the United States.—
Your Memorialists, constituting the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, beg leave to submit to the President of the United States, a statement of the prominent subjects of general interest to the inhabitants of this Territory for which they have been appointed to Legislate, and in the destinies of which they feel a deep public and individual interest.
The Legislative Council will approach the topics, to which they would most respectfully solicit your attention with that frankness and sincerity which Citizens have the pride and satisfaction to assume in addressing the chief magistrate of our grand confederacy;
and through him the Congress of the United States. After a long and protracted negotiation the United States acquired the Floridas, an acquisition which it was then supposed would form one of the brightest epochs in the history of the distinguished administration that negotiated and the Congress that sanctioned the treaty of Cession, and enable the ceded inhabitants with the influx of population and wealth, to fulfil the high destiny to which the God of nature seemed to have assigned this highly favoured Country. Candour however obliges us to say that the act of Congress, for the Organazation of the Government of this Territory, although calculated to remedy many of the defects of the provincial establishment from which it was lately emancipated, was nevertheless not so favorable as we had a right to expect, when we contemplate the value of the acquisition, the commercial and agricultural advantages of the Country, its soils, bays, rivers and harbours, its important resources and energies when developed and called into action and above all its exposed situation possessing a coast of twelve hundred miles, constituting the natural boundary of the most important part of the Union and liable to the incursions of any foreign invader or lawless domestic enemy, whose cupidity and enterprizing avarice might lead them to desolate our towns and plunder our spare population. Your Memorialists do not in the remotest degree, charge the neglect to a want of that careful
<pb#542 />
and provident attention to the interests of the native and adopted Citizens of the United States which has always characterized the policy of those who are intrusted with the Guardianship of our rights, but a want of the requisite information in regard to the necessities and wants of our Territory, deprived as it has been of representation to Congress.
The first subject to which we would particularly invite your attention and that of the Congress of the United States, is one of as much national concern, as solicitude in reference to the immediate prosperity of this Territory—It will be recollected that the late government of Spain over these provinces considered East and West Florida, as two distinct dependancies, from a Connexion of which they could discover no immediate benefit to Spain and consequently the settlements were confined to the vicinity of S’ Augustine and Pensacola more particularly in West Florida where the settlement of the Country was circumscribed by an apprehension of Indian hostility the effect has been to prevent the establishment of a road, from the Capitals of the above provinces to each other, or to the interior; and as we are at present situated the nearest practicable road from one to the other by land, is seven hundred and fifty Miles, through Alabama and Georgia, and the water communication round the Cape is as difficult as a trip to Liverpool or Bourdeaux—a conclusion however unfavorable to the conjunction of the two provinces in a Territory or State, Cannot be drawn from this fact, the distance not being more than three hundred and fifty or four hundred miles, through a healthy fine Country, a large proportion of which your Memorialists are induced to believe for fertility is not surpassed by any land in the Southern Country, a slight view of the geographical situation of the Country, its local and political connexion with the United States, will demonstrate the policy and necessity of preserving the connexion of the Floridas, and also dictate the propriety of laying out a road from Pensacola to S' Augustine from which our government in addition to the lasting improvement of her Territory for the labour and expence, will derive more than an equivalent from the sale of public lands, which will be much inhanced in value by such an improvement. Your memorialists would therefore request that your excellency would direct some intelligent Officers of the Engineer Corps, to explore the country and mark out a road from Pensacola to S*
Augustine" and adopt such measures as to your Excellency may seem fit, to have the same opened in Conformity with their report and also that they be directed to solicit some suitable place, in the Mickasuky Country or on the Suwanny River or the adjacent Country for the
<pb#543 />
permanent seat of Government of Florida" and make report thereof to the Governor of this Territory to be laid before the next Legislative Council. Whilst we are on the subject of the Establishment of public roads, so nearly Connected with the growth, wealth and prosperity of this Territory, we would also take the liberty to recommend to the General Government the necessisty and practibility of opening the road from S*Augustine into Georgia known by the appellation of the Kings road,” which was open'd at great expence by the British Government, and could at this time be reopened with very little labour and will afford a communication to facilitate the entercourse between that part of the Territory and the Southern States—
the establishment of this road was deemed an object of the utmost importance to the province of East Florida by the British Government, Your Memorialists are induced to believe that the policy and necessity of such measure will be more strongly felt by the Government of the United States.
Your Memorialists would beg leave particularly to direct the attention of the Congress of the United States to the necessity of erecting light Houses at Pensacola and S* Augustine" and also to provide some law upon the subject of wrecking at the penensula of Florida,” which is now in the hands of foreigners, and subject to the absolute controul of the colonies of Great Britain and Spain, and is frequently made the pretext for Piracy and smuggling.
Another subject to which the Legislative Council will call the attention of Congress is the organization of the judiciary in this Territory, by reference to the Act of Congress” it will be found that two District Courts are established, one in East and the other in West Florida, those courts are vested with jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases without an appeal from their decisions to any other tribunal, only when they entertain jurisdiction in their Federal Capacity, it follows therefore that the act of Congress have vested in one Judge power over the lives, liberties and properties of the Citizens of this Territory without providing for an appeal or writ of error to Correct a Judgment rendered by misconception of the law, partiality, or judicial impetuosity, whatever confidence we may repose in the virtues of our Judges, or the upright integrity of the American Bench, * See act approved May 24, 1824, 4 STAT. 30.
<pb#544 />
Your memorialists conceive that it is a novel and dangerous power, inconsistent with the policy of our government, and contrary to the usual course in relation to all other Territories, in all of which if they are not mistaken three judges have been appointed who were required to hold Courts in different parts of the Territories, and once or twice a year hold a court of Errors and appeals, in all cases arising under the Territorial laws. Two Judges are incompetent to form such a connective tribunal. to supply the deficiencies in the judiciary system as regulated by the act of Congress the Legislative Council considered it incumbent upon them to establish inferior Courts” as a temporary expedient making it the duty of the Judges of the Inferior Courts to hold pleas in the Several Counties with an appeal from their decision to the District Court of the United States: we believe this course to be indispensible to the convenience of large settlements remote from S" Augustine and Pensacola, a contrary policy would have subjected them to great inconvenience and in many instances would have been tantamount to a denial of justice, We considered it necessary to prevent Crime by its speedy punishment, to restrain the refractory, to protect the weak from the oppression of the strong, and thus to insure virtue and humanity among our Citizens, and accomplish the great end of society, the happiness of the people—
The salaries of the Judges of the Inferior Courts amount to two thousand four hundred Dollars, and as we are in the first grade of Territorial government, we have reason to expect that Congress will make an appropriation of that sum—and also provide for the appointment of another Judge to reside at the seat of Government, which will do away the necessity of a longer Continuance of the Inferior Courts.”
There is another topic of considerable interest and magnitude to this Territory and the United States upon which your memorialists would respectfully express their opinions on the present occasion. In consequence of the great extent of sea Coast by which Florida is bounded, and the consequent exposure to which she is subjected, the speedy settlement of the Country will readily present itself to your excellency as an object of the most important consideration. In order to give that strength and security to Territories thus peculiarly situated, emigration should be invited to them by every advisable means, within the controul of the General Government. To accomplish this desirable purpose it may be considered of the first moment, that the claims to land of every description should be promptly ascertained and adjusted.—Upon this subject your Memorialists would with all the respect and Confidence due to the Constituted Authorities

of the Union, recommend that the powers of the Commissioners should be inlarged, relative to claims upon which they are authorized to pronounce a final decision.” Your Memorialists would also suggest the propriety of referring the larger grants to the investigation and determination of the Judicial Tribunals.” Were the existence of this power thus vested in our courts, and transferred from our national Councils it is confidently believed, that much expence would be avoided as well as more ample and speedy Justice administered to all parties concerned. The members of the judiciary residing in the Territory and having obtained an acquaintance with the laws and ordinances of the government from which the claims emenated, they must necessarily be much better qualified to pronounce an opinion than any tribunal differently constituted; from the decissions of the courts here an appeal might be given to the Supreme Court, and thus the validity of titles decided by the constitutional arbiter the judiciary which would eminently Contribute to secure the rights of the United States and the claimants.
Untill these difficulties are obviated it cannot be expected that emigration should be successfully directed to the Territory of Florida, large tracts of land are in some places covered by private claims, before the proprietors can make any permanent disposition of them to settlers, by which a dense and efficient population can be obtained it is indispensably necessary that they should be free from all incumbrance and litigation. This end can be most speedily, cheaply and certainly accomplished by the judicial Tribunals of our Country.—Next to bringing the public lands into market at an earl]y period, your Memorialists consider the prompt and fi[na]l decision of land claims as an object of the highest Consideration, upon it, not only depends the growth and prosperity of this Territory, but the effectation of these valuable purposes for which the United States obtained their Cession by the late Treaty with Spain.
In conclusion your Memorialists would beg leave to represent to your Excellency the superior advantages of the Harbour of Pensacola over any other in the Gulph of Mexico south of New Orleans and suggest the policy of selecting it as a Naval Depot by the government of the United States," although engineers have been appointed to make a survey of the harbour who are amply competent to form a correct estimate of its importance; yet it is to be hoped, that the suggestions of your Memorialists may not be considered obtrusive but received with complacency as the offspring of a lively interest in the welfare of this Territory and of the United States.
<pb#546 />
From a survey that has been made of the Harbour of Pensacola under the orders of the general Government, it is understood by your Memorialists that at the lowest water vessels drawing not more than twenty one and a half feet may cross the Bar and enter the harbour with perfect safety, the medium depth of water between the highest and lowest tide may be confidently estimated at two additional feet making in the aggregate twenty three and a half feet.—It is believed from the best advice which has been obtained upon the subject, that this depth of water on the Bar is sufficient for the entrance of vessels of any description, save those of the largest class; the locality of the bay is likewise such as to secure every facility to the entrance and departure of vessels. The opposite extremes of its oblong form extends in a Northeastwardly and southwesterly direction, which happily corresponds with the general range of winds so as to subject vessels to very little delay in their arrival and departure. After Wessels have entered the bay they have every assurance of the most perfect security even in the most violent gales, it is completely land locked by main land and the Island of S" Rosa, it uncommonly capacious and its bottom affording a stiff tenacious clay constituting a safe and excellent anchorage. From S' Carlos De Barrancas to the opposite point of S' Rosa's Island is computed to be about three fourths of a Mile, with suitable fortifications at those two opposite positions, it is confidently believed by military Gentlemen of science who have visited them and expressed an opinion that no vessel could pass into the Bay without receiving a fatal injury, the guns of both fortifications could be brought to bear upon it with so much Certainty and effect as to insure destruction. Every examination which has been made of these commanding stations has resulted in the decided opinion that it can be much more easily defended than any other on the Gulph, if not on the whole of the Atlantic Coast. A faithful Topography of Pensacola and the adjacent Country will demonstrate that it may be very effectually protected from the inroads of the enemy by land. In the rear of the Town at [a] distance of about half a mile the high lands are present[ed]
upon which Military works may be constructed to advantage so as completely to command the whole space intervening between them and the bay. A Single fortification strongly and Judiciously built would successfully bear upon the entrance into the Town in every direction, there is probably no other station on the Southern Coast, which could be defended by land with so small a number of Troops or at less expence. Independently of the facility with which Pensacola may be defended, if reliance is exclusively reposed in regular troops.
There are other prominent considerations which powerfully recommend to the attention of the General Government this results from its immediate connexion with New Orleans, and its contiguity with most of the States on the Mississippi River, in cases of emergency
<pb#547 />
and invasion should it become necessary to call the aid of the Militia for the protection of this place they can be readily obtained from Louisiana Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama owing to an advantage from a water Communication, they may be conveyed to Pensacola in a short time, and comparatively with small expence to the General Government; Your Memorialists are induced to believe that half of the expenditures of the late war were included in the item of transportation much would be saved on this score were Pensacola selected as a Naval station not only in the transportation of Soldiery but also in provisions and Munitions of War. This desirable object would be more completely accomplished should ever a Communication be opened between the Bay of Pensacola and the Mississippi and Mobille rivers; Another prominent advantage in favor of Pensacola which gives it elevated claims on the patronage of the Government is that it is distinguished for the salubrity of atmosphere and mildness of climate it is a situation where the troops may always calculate on enjoying good health, and where it is represented that breadstuffs and other provisions continue almost as long in a perfect state of preservation as in most of the northern ports of the United States.
In addition to this your memorialists will take the present occasion to remark that a military force stationed at Pensacola, would in time of war give efficient aid in the defence of New Orleans as well as additional security to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama by presenting a formidable barrier by which inroads through West Florida would be checked and prevented. This assistance could not with any certainty be obtained from Tampa Bay, and no other position it is believed can be selected south of Pensacola which promises the other important advantages, we have described in Consequence of it remaining a great distance from a dense population and the difficulties of transportation, it cannot be so Conveniently connected with the adjoining States and must rely for defence almost entirely upon regular troops a much larger number of which will be necessarily required.
The occupation of Pensacola with the necessary fortifications is calculated to afford a more complete command over the commerce of the Gulph of Mexico than any other position which could be selected on the southern Coast; with this peculiar advantage, the united states would exclude the shipping of an enemy probably from the only port in Florida in which they could anchor with safety owing to the violence of the West India Gales, Your Memorialists are of the opinion that there is no other Harbour save that of the Havanna in which they could ride with security during a storm. But the benefits arising from the selection of [Pen]sacola as a Naval Statioln] are not entirely of a negative] character, we should not only be enabled to exclude the hostile Armaments of Foreign Nations but our own Vessels could be protected from capture and disaster; the Harbour of Pensacola will
<pb#548 />
always be a place of secure retreat, a station from which expeditions may be fitted out without interruption and from which the West India commerce of an enemy might receive the most successfull annoyance. Were New Orleans assailed, Pensacola would be competent to afford Cooperation for its defence both by land and water which could not fail to excite in the enemy the most fearful apprehensions;
by our vigorous and well directed efforts her commerce would be cut off, her detatchments Captured and in the end her surrender and retreat accomplished, the security of this place then is believed by Your Memorialists to be inseperably connected with the prosperity and defence of New Orleans and the Contiguous States. We therefore pray the attention of your Excellency to the subjects upon which we have taken the liberty to remark and be assured that those who give a different Account of our Territory are ignorant of its resources or wantonly misrepresent it.

<docbody>DEAR SIR. It is with deep sorrow that I annouce to you the death of my friends Doct" Bronaugh and M. Harrison, late Attorney for the United States on the 10" of August the yellow fever commenced in Pensacola with dreadful distruction—Very few of the great number that have been taken down, have recovered—Capt Simms" from Alexandria is also dead, I believe he held the appointment of Navy agent at Pensacola The best and most inteligent part of our American population has already fallen victims to this distructive fever—No hope is entertained of its abatement untill frost, which will not commence untill the last of October I lived with my friend Doct. Bronaugh in Col" Waltons family, It is almost a wonder that I escaped—for every member of his family has been or is now down with the fever except himself and his venerable mother I fear he will take the fever, and expect every day to hear this distressing inteligence The Spanish inhabitants stand it much better than our own peoplenot that they are exempt, for many of them have been, and now are sick—but few have yet died. The Legislative Counsel are at this place, their labours are nearly at a close—Judge Breckenridge is wellhaving quit the City some weeks since, no court will be held in Pensacola untill november, and as yet none has been held—I pray you sir to appoint Capt—Richard K. Call the Attorney for the united States in West Florida, I assure you this gentleman is well quallified for the office, he is a young man of talents, and gives great attention to his business, he has the best practice as a Lawyer in Pensacola, and has the intire confidence of the Americans and Spaniards The appointment will be most gratifying to the People of Florida to Gen.'
Jackson and myself, I make this application without the consent or

knowledge of Capt. Call—because if he obtains the appointment he may feel, that his former disappointment for the same station, was not occasioned by any want of merit on his part, or objection to him on yours."—The Spanish inhabitants of this country are the best even among the most quiet and orderly of our own citizens The distresses occasioned in Pensacola by the fever cannot be discribed, poor little children, without parents or friends are thrown on the charity of strangers we have not a cent to relieve the wretched The Spanish citizens act nobley, they have done and continue to do all in their power to relieve the sick Americans many of whom are taken to houses and nursed with the utmost kindness I have no funds either to pay the expence incident to the sitting of the Legislative Counsel or to pay for the printing of the Laws of the Territory—altho, the act of Congress directs me to publish them, Is their no funds that can be used for these Objects I have written several times to M' Adams on these subjects but as yet have received no answer *

<docbody>HON' JOHN C CALHOUN Secretary at war SIR. I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 19" of August with several inclosures," containing extracts of letters from Gen' Jackson of the date of Sept. 20" 1821 "–An extract of a letter from Cap" J. R. Bell dated the 22" April 1822"—and a copy of a letter from yourself to Co.' Eustace at S*Augustine * and also a copy of your letter to Co.' Humphreys Indian Agent dated the 19* August
1822 " and a copy of a list of articles and stores belonging to the United States' Indian Department, left in the charge of Edmund M
Wanton and delivered over to Charles Vignoles April 12" 1822 as appears from the said list.
From the information which I have obtained from that part of the Country lying between the Suwanny and the Alochua, now inhabited by the Indians, I have little doubt it is the richest and most valuable part of all Florida—in fact there are no bodies of good land in either East or West Florida but in that region of country—It will be a serious misfortune to this Territory if the Indians are permitted to occupy this tract of country—It will sustain a larger population than all Florida beside, and from the sale of the lands in that quarter only can the United States hope to realize the money which they paid for Florida—If that country is ceded to the Indians, Florida can be of no importance except only for its few sea ports. The view of your Department in relation to the Indians in Florida, “that they should join the Creek Indians in Georgia” ought if possible to be carried into effect; for place them in any situation you may in Florida, they can at any time cut off the communication between Pensacola and S*
Augustine, for owing to the particular face of the Country, the com-
<pb#554 />
munication between the two places must be high up in Florida in order to pass the various streams that flow into the Gulph—If Congress will not agree to move the Florida Indians to the Upper Creeks, to whom they properly belong, they ought to be sent West of the Mississippi—no treaty ought to be made with them until the country they occupy has been properly explored"—I hope that you will not act at all in this business until it is submitted to Congress, for if you were to authorize this fall a Treaty to be held with the Indians, owing to the sickly state of New Orleans, Pensacola and Fort S" Marks, the proper supplies for the Treaty could not be had in time, as it will be December before health will be restored to those places—I shall however direct the Indians to be assembled according to your desire but hope that no treaty will be held with them until this subject is farther investigated.
My private affairs which I have neglected for more than a year, since I have been in public employment, demand my return to Kentucky and I expect to leave this place in a few days, you will therefore be pleased to address your communications to the Secretary of this Territory, Co." George Walton.”

HON' JOHN QINCY ADAMS Secretary of State.
SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20" of August,” and also the receipt of a Commission to John De La Rua and Joseph Noriega as Members of the Legislative Council
<pb#555 />
of Florida.” The Council adjourned on the 18* Inst. having some time before adjourned to this place from Pensacola on account of the yellow fever, and I am sorry to add, that Doc" J. C. Bronough President of the Council and the chief clerk John Coppinger Connor have fallen victims to this disease—almost all the American population of Pensacola have died.
It being impossible to publish the Laws of this Territory according to the act of Congress and distribute the same without the funds for this purpose—I shall be under the necessity of drawing upon you to meet these objects for the printer here has not funds to carry on the work unless I become responsible to those on whom he must depend for credit for the necessary materials. The necessary expences of the Legislative Council including the rent of a room, stationary, Clerk hire, tables &c must be paid forthwith as they are claims that will not admit of delay—I do not believe that the printing and distribution of the Laws together with every other incidental expense occasioned by the Council, will exceed three thousand three hundred dollars—I make this estimate from the several amounts fixed by the Legislative Council for clerk hire, printing &c which I know to be unusually moderate—It will be a saving to the Government to permit the accounts to be settled by the governor or secretary, as they know what each individual is entitled to—I do not hesitate to assure you that whenever the individuals send on their accounts to you, from this Territory, they never fail to make them more than equal to their services—this I believe to be the fact, except in the case of the Secretary Co' Walton, who, in my humble opinion ought to be allowed at least six hundred dollars more than his account rendered to you—There are many small claims for services due to various individuals in East Florida—
and there are still existing claims here, for confining and maintaining prisoners in jail, for which no compensation has ever been made to the jailer—a similar claim also exists in East Florida—and both at Pensacola and S*Augustine rooms have been rented for the purpose
<pb#556 />
of holding Courts, and as offices for the Clerks—I would submit it therefore, sir to you, whether it is not the interest of the Government to place funds in the hands of the Governor of this Territory to discharge these claims as I am sure it will be done for much less when the Governor himself looks into the accounts and examines the claims, than if the claimants were paid at the seat of Government—
should you think with me on this subject and authorize me to draw on you for this purpose, I will take care that no exorbitant or improper claim shall be paid and that proper vouchers shall be taken and returned to you, shewing specifically how the funds have been applied.
I have the pleasure to inform you that the Spanish inhabitants are daily becoming more and more satisfied with our Government, and that throughout the Territory the utmost order and harmony prevail among the old and new inhabitants. The code of Laws enacted by the Legislative Council, I believe well calculated for the situation of the Territory.
I have made it my business to conciliate as far as my duty would permit the Spanish inhabitants, and I believe have succeeded.
In the distribution of the various little offices of the Territory, I
have given to the ancient inhabitants wherever I found them qualified their due proportion—I trust that this course will meet the approbation of the President and yourself.
The Civil Government of the Territory is now pretty well organized, and I am now endeavouring under our late law to place the Militia on a respectable footing, which I expect to finish in a few days.
An absence from Kentucky, where my family resides, for a year past, with the exception of ten days last spring on my way to Pensacola has occasioned me some serious pecuniary losses, it therefore becomes indispensible that I should return to Kentucky to arrange my private affairs, before I go on to S*Augustine where the Legislative Council is to meet in the spring, this I would not do, if my presence was likely to be necessary before my return "–You will be pleased therefore in my absence to address your communications to Co.'

<dochead>SECRETARY OF STATE</dochead>
<source>[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:AL]</source>
<place-time>Private St AUGUSTINE 14th Octr 1822</place-time>
<docbody>Believing that the Government of the United States are very illy informed of the real situation of public affairs in this Territory, the writer of this letter takes the liberty to mention a few facts from which the Government will draw such inferences as seem naturally to result from them.
1. It is an undeniable fact that Governor Duval has become extremely unpopular throughout all Florida. The Spanish inhabitants, to a man, are dissatisfied with his conduct—his name is now never mentioned here without censure. His conduct in regard to the election of Bronaugh was shameful in the highest degree—his conduct was equally so in regard to the election of the Mayor of Pensacola, endeavouring, by the influence of his office, to force upon the inhabitants as mayor, a Stranger from New Orleans of no sort of consideration—his scheme was defeated by the united opposition of all the Spanish inhabitants and almost every upright American in the place.
2. Two of the members of the Legislative Council, M. Law and Major Murray, have just arrived here from Pensacola, which place they left about the 21" of Septr. The Governor was in a few days to set out for Kentucky, without meeting the Indians at St. Marks, as he had publickly announced was his intention. He is not to come again into Florida until May, and has declared his intention not to move his family into Florida at all. Thus, he will receive $4000 a year, his salary as Governor and Indian Agent together, reside in Kentucky and only come into Florida a couple of months in a year to attend the Legislative Council. It is the general opinion here, and very freely expressed by all classes, that by obtaining the office of Governor he only meant to make a Job of it. Very great dissatisfaction is universally felt and loudly expressed on this occasion.
They people here expect the Governor to reside with his family in the Territory—to consider it his home. This Country never can flourish under the system which has hitherto been pursued in regard to it—
<pb#560 />
3. Judge Smith arrived here about a fortnight ago, but he can do nothing as a Judge never having been sworn into office—and that stupid act of congress made for the government of Florida, requires that he should take his oath of office only before the Governor—
He is not disposed to run after the Governor into Kentucky, consequently there can be no Court here until next spring—unless Congress will graciously please to rectify their blunders, and authorise the Judge to take his oath before any Magistrate competent to administer one. If this be done immediately on the meeting of congress—
the Territorial Court may yet be opened in January next.
4. There is no Marshal yet here to serve the process of the Court.
5. The Sheriff of this County is unable to give the bonds required by the act of the Legislative Council, consequently cannot enter upon the duties of his office—and it will take at least 70 or 80 days, even if the Sheriff were to resign, which he will not do although he cannot act, before another could be appointed by M. Walton the Secretary, acting for Governor Duval. The Coroner appointed has not yet been able to give the bonds required—So that we are absolutely without the means of administering Justice either Civil or Criminal in this Section of the Territory.
4. There is no Jail here nor any public or private building suitable for one, except the Fort, which indeed is fit for nothing else, and would make a very good Jail. But the Military keep possession of it, although they have not the least use for it—all the officers and soldiers are quartered at the Barracks, which have been repaired at great expense to the U. S.
Half a dozen soldiers are marched up to the fort every morning and relieved the next morning—and this is all that the Military do with the fort. Surely it would be more useful as a prison for debtors and criminals—
There are many other matters intimately connected with the welfare and prosperity of this Country, to which the attention of the Government ought to be directed. The fundamental error in the Act of Congress for the government of the Floridas, was the uniting of them under one Government. If congress were unwilling to go to the expense of two territorial governments, they ought to have annexed West Florida to Alabama. Nature and every consideration of interest and public good demand it. The two Floridas never can flourish under one government. There is no unity of feeling or interest between them. They are too distant from each other—that is, the two Capitals—and neither will be settled half so fast if kept under the present system of Gov" that each would, if Pensacola was attached to Alabama.
Public roads and bridges are indispensably necessary for the settlement of East Florida—and as Congress have forbidden the
<pb#561 />
Local Legislature to tax the public lands, these roads and bridges never can be made from the revenue arising from taxes on private property. East Florida is capable of sustaining a very dense population—but alas! What encouragement is there for settlers to come among us—a Country without law or Justice—where scarcely an acre of land is not liable to litigation, and no Courts to determine the titles.
The land commissioners, it is said, have done nothing at Pensacola and although they were to come here next January, either cannot or will not come till next May.
Having chosen this Country as my future abode, through life, I
hope the deep interest I feel in its welfare and prosperity will excuse the freedom of these remarks—

[Enclosure]
An Article from the East Florida Herald
[October 1822)
THE ELECTION.
The polls being now finally closed, we must wait for the return from West Florida, to ascertain the result of the election. Meanwhile, it may not be improper to take a brief view of some extraordinary circumstances, which have attended this election; and to call the attention of the public to certain facts closely connected with it.
It is not the least of the blessings of a free Government, that the press is open to all fair and candid animadversion on the conduct of public officers, however eminent their station or their talents.
Not only the conduct of public officers, but the acts of private individuals, in matters of public concern, are just and legitimate subjects of investigation and comment. This is the great advantage of a free press, to the rights and interests of the community.
Errors and abuses, which otherwise would be repeated are, by this means, corrected and repressed; and the wrong-doers made to know, that if they do not alter the course of their conduct, punishment and the indignation of an injured people await them.
Impressed with these principles we shall proceed to notice:
1. The conduct of his excellency the Governor, in regard to the election.
2. The conduct of certain individuals recently appointed to office by his Excellency.
First, then, with regard to the Governor.
<pb#563 />
It is an undeniable fact, that previously to the appointment of the Governor, at Washington, Dr. Bronaugh then being there, openly declared his intention to become a candidate for delegate to congress from this Territory; and avowed that he should avail himself of the votes of the common soldiers to effect his object.
It is another fact, not less susceptible of positive proof, that Governor Duval, previously and subsequently to his appointment, did pledge himself to support the election of Dr. Bronaugh. What were the motives or inducements to make this pledge, whether a high opinion entertained of the virtues and abilities, or the peculiar fitness of that gentleman for the office, or a belief that he was popular in Florida—or something else, we shall not, at present, inquire: we only state the fact.
On the return of Dr. Bronaugh to Pensacola, his name with high commendations, was announced, as a candidate in the news paper printed there. Col. Barnett was subsequently mentioned, as another candidate; but it was notorious that the Governor gave his sole and decided support to the former.
The Legislative Council, owing to delay in the arrival of many of the members, did not assemble until the 22d day of July. Congress are to meet on the first Monday of December, consequently no time ought to have been lost in passing an act by the council to provide for, and fix the period of the election of the delegate. It is well known that it takes the mail at least thirty days, to pass between Pensacola and St. Augustine. The election, therefore could not, with propriety have been delayed longer than the first day of October, to admit of the returns in time for the delegate to arrive at Washington, on the meeting of Congress.
One would, therefore, naturally have supposed that this subject would have been the first to which the Governor, in his speech, would have called the attention of the Council. Instead of which we find him perfectly silent on this matter.
The Legislative Council entered upon other business—passed many other laws, which might just as well have been delayed until after the passing of the election law;—and finally did not pass that law, until the 12th. day of August: too late to allow the inhabitants of East Florida, to have notice of it and make the necessary arrangements for the election.
It may perhaps, be said, that this was the fault of the Council, and not of the Governor. We answer: that it was the fault of both. the Governor is surely to blame for not recommending in his speech, the early attention of the Council to this subject.
We shall now notice some extraordinary features in this act, for which we hold the Governor not less censurable than the majority of the council; for he was bound, by the duties of his office, to refuse his
<pb#564 />
assent to the law if defective or improper in any part of it.—The first objection to the act is, that the 10th section is so worded that the common soldiers in the Territory are intended to be allowed to Vote:
that was the avowed object of the majority. The next, and assuredly a very strong objection is, that the votes are to be given viva voce. We shall not dwell upon the gross impropriety of these provisions in the act, as the subject has already received the pointed and severe reprobation of the public. But it is evident to every dispassionate mind that the tendency of these provisions was to secure the election of Bronaugh, with the aid of the soldiers. The giving of the votes viva voce would necessarily take away all freedom in many of the electors.
Hence, the officers of the army devoted to Dr. Bronaugh, might, by that means, compel the troops to vote for him; and certain persons appointed to civil offices by the Governor, might also control the votes of many of the citizens.
But this is not the worst that was done, apparently with a view to promote the election of the Governor's favourite candidate. We find it devolving on his Excellency himself to make the selection of places where the election was to be held. He named in his proclamation six places in West Florida, and only three in East Florida, although the latter is at least four times greater in extent than the former. By this arrangement a great proportion of the voters, in East Florida, would be obliged to travel from thirty to fifty miles, and a considerable number, upwards of a hundred, to come to any poll.—This consequence has ensued; that not one fourth part of the population of this section of the Territory have been able to vote at all.
Again, at the Cowford, where it was natural to suppose that a great many votes would be taken if the people had attended, instead of appointing the judges of the election, at that poll, from the neighborhood, where many respectable planters resided, only one Judge was appointed in that quarter, another 25 miles off, and a third at the distance of 50 miles.
The consequence of which was, that one of the Judges, being sick, could not attend and the other came some hours after the poll was opened; and, to the astonishment of every body refused to act.—but of this more hereafter.
On this occasion we cannot forbear to contrast the conduct of Mr.
Dawson with that of Judge Reynolds. The former was obliged to act alone, as a Judge of the election, and conducted himself with strict impartiality and the greatest propriety thro'out.
In vain may the defenders of the Governor attempt to excuse this part of his conduct, by pretending that he was ignorant of the situation and extent of the country, and the names of suitable persons to be appointed Judges. A list of six places in East Florida, with the names of five or six persons, at each place, qualified in every respect, for the
<pb#565 />
office of Judges was sent to him by respectable men in this City, long before the election law was passed.
Besides, he had Capt. Hanham with him, who well knew the whole country and the inhabitants, and who could have given him all the necessary information on this subject.—We impute no impure motives to his Excellency in making this extraordinary distinction between East and West Florida; but with the before mentioned facts in view, it seems impossible, for any candid and reflecting person, not to draw inferences unfavourable to his impartial conduct, in regard to the election. We would fain believe, and we indulge the hope of seeing it manifested by his future conduct, that he is the Governor of Florida, and not the supporter of any particular party or faction.
We shall now make a few remarks on the conduct of some of the public officers, recently appointed by his Excellency.
The first gentleman whom we find figuring in this election, is the Sheriff of St. Johns County. He leaves his seat in the Legislative Council comes express here, travelling thro’ the country between the St. Marys and the St. Johns, distributing Dr. Bronaugh's circular addresses in every direction, and using his utmost influence and endeavors to induce the people to vote for that candidate, giving them to understand that he was the Governor's candidate; and that it would be highly displeasing to his Excellency if they should not support Dr.
Bronaugh. He did more—he attended the poll, at the Cowford, and there zealously and actively electioneered for Bronaugh, until the news of his death reached that place, when he immediately returned home.
The sheriff of the new County called Duval, a Mr. Dill or Dell, as he writes his name, took a similar active part in the election, in favour of Bronough. He brought up with him to the Cowford a number of his neighbours, who had never before heard of the name of Dr. Bronaugh; and if the reports of respectable persons, who were present, may be believed this Mr. Dell and his associate all behaved in the most riotous and disorderly manner.
So determined was Mr. Dell, in the support of Bronough, that after the news of his death reached the poll, and no one doubted of it, he swore his friends should vote for him, dead or alive, and some of them actually did, the next day, give in their votes for him although they admitted he was dead.
We do not pretend to question the right of a Governor or a sheriff to vote for whom he may please, and to express an opinion in favour of any one candidate, in prefernce to another, but we do say, that we think it highly improper in a Governor or a Sheriff to take a warm and active part in any election. The Sheriff's business at a poll, when he attends one, is to keep the peace and promote good order—not to be instrumental in disturbing the peace, much less to put himself at the
301867–67–36
<pb#566 />
head of a riotous gang, and encourage and protect them in their disorderly conduct.
The next person whose conduct at the election we feel obliged to notice, though it gives us much pain to do so, because we had previously entertained a high opinion of his character and respectabilty is Mr. Reynolds, late one of the Judges of the County Court, and recently appointed a Justice of the Peace by his Excellency the Governor.
This gentleman was appointed one of the Judges of the election at the Cowford; but instead of being there at the opening of the poll, he did not arrive till the afternoon of the first day, and then refused to act, giving as a reason, that one of the Judges had opened the poll without waiting for him. By this conduct, Mr. Reynolds has undoubtedly incurred the penalty of 200 dollars, imposed by the law;
and any one may prosecute him for the same and receive one half.
He however, remained at the poll, and in conjunction with Mr. Dell, as we are informed, electioneered for Bronough, until the news came of his death. He then discouraged the people from voting at all, pretending that the election would be void, because only one Judge held the poll—so that a great number who came there actually went away without giving in their votes.
Now, we would make the same observations in regard to the conduct of Judge Reynolds, which have been made in respect to that of the Sheriffs. No one denies his right to express his opinion in favour of this or that candidate; but we do consider it highly indecorous, in his situation, as one of the Judges of the election, to have been active and busy in the support of any particular candidate. We however repeat, that we impute no corrupt motives to any of the above named gentlemen, but attribute their acts to a highly improper and blameable zeal, to effect their object—the election of their favuorite candidate.
We shall now close these remarks, with this observation; that we sincerely declare that we feel not the least animosity or personal illwill towards any of the persons whose conduct we have deemed it fit to notice.
For his Excellency the Goveror, we entertain a very high respect and regard; but we consider it a duty incumbent upon every honest and upright member of the community, who feels an interest in the honour and welfare of this Country, to enter his solemn protest against the measures and conduct which have been pursued by the persons before mentioned, in the hope and expectation that similar abuses will not be again practised.

DEAR SIR By the last mail I received a letter from Cap" Pelham,”
informing me of bad state of his health, and that you had engaged to act for him in discharging such duties as he, as Sub Agent for Indian Affairs, ought to perform. I desire therefore that you will take of Samuel S.

I also desire that you will give notice to all the Indians in East Florida that a treaty will be held at Fort Marks on the 20" day of next November,” when the Chiefs are all required to attend.

Abraham Eustis to Governor DuVal STAUGUSTINE–15th Sept. 1822–
GOVERNOR—I had the honor to address a hasty letter to you by the last week's mail,” enclosing a copy of the replies made by the Sec of War to certain questions,” which I had propounded in relation to the affairs of the Indians.”—Upon a full consideration of the Secretary's letter, & of the Laws regulating trade & intercourse with the Indians, I cannot find that it is required of me to adopt any positive measures, or to make any direct interference with the few white settlers within, & near the Indian Boundary. I have determined therefore to remain quiet, unless some overt act of misconduct on the part of the whites should render my interposition absolutely necessary. A considerable trade in Cattle & Horses has, as I am informed, been carried on by two or three individuals during the last two months. But when regularly notified of its illegality, they, without much murmuring ceased to pursue it, & your proclamation which I have caused to be published in the East Florida Herald will without doubt entirely terminate this unlicensed trade.
Capt. Hanham arrived here yesterday, & from his hand I had the honor to receive your communication of the 24” Aug" * enclosing a blank license for Samuel (meaning Horatio) S Dexter. I have informed that gentleman of its being in my possession to be filled up, & delivered to him, whenever he will give the required bond. But as he is still a Spanish subject, I have, under the instructions of the Sec”
of War, required him to take the oath of allegiance to the U.S. M."
Dexter's object appears rather to have been to obtain a special license to purchase a given number of horses, cattle & negroes, than a general license for Indian Trade.”—I shall immediately take measures to notify the Indians of East Florida that their attendance is required at St Marks on the 20" Nov next, as directed by your letter. For this purpose I intend to send for the Pond Chief (Micanope) & two or three others, who I am told are at the head of affairs. Some little expense must necessarily be incurred, for which I request you will provide the necessary means of disbursement. I understand that
<pb#569 />
Capt. Bell has funds of the Indian Department in his possession, which he is directed to pay over to your order.—
I have the honor to be &c &c ABRm EUSTIS

GOVERNOR According to the intention, which I had the honor to communicate in my letter of the 15" Ult° * I dispatched a messenger on the 22" Ult” to Miconope the Pond Governor to inform him that I had a communication to make to him, & to request him & two or three of the head men of the Seminole Indians to come & see me at this place. My object in desiring to see them was that I might personally communicate to the Chiefs your directions respecting the Treaty to be held at St Marks on the 20th Nov * & also the views of the Government respecting their lands, boundaries & intercourse with the whites, as explained in the letter addressed to me by the Department of War,” a copy of which I submitted to you on the 10" Ult”
The Indians have not yet come in, & the time for the meeting at S"
Marks is so rapidly approaching that I have some doubts, whether they will come at all. The enclosed copies of communications from Mr Dexter * will explain the causes of their delay. I expect to see him tomorrow & hope to obtain more satisfactory information from him. Whatever the state of affairs among the Indians may prove to be, it is hardly possible for me to interpose with any effect, as I am wholly destitute of funds, & my entire force here consists of forty nine enlisted men.
17. Oct I have just seen and and conversed with Mr Dexter, who left Volusia on the 15* ins' He brings no further information than was communicated in his letter, except that about forty Indian women had arrived & encamped in the neighbourhood of his plantation, bringing with them their poultry & moveables,—They informed him that Micanope was assembling his warriors & negroes & was determined to fight in defence of his home & his property. His force may be estimated at one hundred fighting men.
The hostile party is supposed to be about one hundred & thirty.
As their object appears merely to be plunder, I do not believe there will be much blood shed ”—

I have informed the Mayor that the public buildings not having been formally turned over to me, although no longer Occupied by the Military, I did not think it proper to take any step untill I had previously addressed you on the subject.—I should wish to make the arrangement entirely Convenient to the Military, but understanding that it is not their intention to return to Pensacola, I presume there can be no objection to giving possession to the Civil Authority, of all such buildings, as are not actually used and Occupied for Military purposes—

<place-time>La Rua's 8 miles from PENSACOLA, October 21" 1822.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR; In consequence of the prevailance of the yellow fever at Pensacola, our duties, as Commissioners, have been suspended for more than two months. Such has been the fury and fatality with which it raged, that very few Americans who were attacked, have survived. Out of a population of about 1,500 or 2,000, between 2 or
300 have fallen victims. There was no safety but in flight, and we were so fortunate as to retire at a period sufficiently early, to avoid its ravages. We sincerely regret the necessity which imperatively urged the adoption of this measure, and the consequent postponement in the prosecution of our duties, but it was altogether unavoidable. Had we remained in Pensacola, we should, probably have shared the fate of those who failed to remove, without any prospect of accomplishing any valuable purpose. The population was flying in every direction where they could obtain accommodation, and those who remained in the city, were, in numerous instances, either assailed themselves, or engaged in discharging towards those who were, the ordinary offices of duty and humanity. Such was the general alarm and distress, that business of almost every description was suspended. Under such circumstances, it would have been impossible to make any progress in the adjudication of land claims. The disease has nearly altogether subsided; but we are apprehensive, it proceeds more from the want of subjects, than from any other cause. About a week since, the last cases which proved fatal, have been represented to be as virulent as any that have occurred. The weather yet continues warm at Pensacola, and we are advised, that it will not be safe to return until frost, which may be expected about the middle of next month. The population may be then expected to return to the city, and we may calculate upon being enabled to proceed in the accomplishment of our commission.
<pb#573 />
Since our retirement to the country, all that we have been enabled to perform, has received our attention. The papers submitted, have been mostly recorded.—
We have considered it our duty to communicate these facts, in order that Congress may adopt such measures as may be necessary to meet them. Owing to the lamentable calamity which has visited the city of Pensacola, our duties will have been interrupted for so great a length of time, that it will be impossible for us to close the business in West Florida, within the time prescribed in the law organizing this Board of Commissioners. It will be absolutely necessary that the sessions should be extended. We would, therefore respectfully suggest, that the subject be submitted to Congress as soon as they shall be convened, so that provision be made to this end as early as possible.
It will probably be practicable to pass a supplemental act for this purpose, sufficiently early to reach us before the termination of our session at Pensacola, which is very disirable"—
We are, with every sentiment of respect, Y' Mo. Obt. Sevts.

SIR, I have received a letter from Governor Duval" in which he suggests the propriety on account of the sickliness of the season, of postponing for the present the treaty which it was contemplated to hold with the Florida Indians next. The suggestion of the Governor is approved, and Col: Eustis at S" Augustine has been directed" in the absence of the Indian Agent to inform the Indians that the treaty will be postponed to a more favorable season. You will accordingly not take any steps for holding a treaty with the Indians at the above mentioned period.”
The Indian Agent, it is expected will shortly arrive in Florida.
Should he arrive during the absence of the Governor, you will inform him of the postponement of the treaty, and give him such instructions as you may deem necessary upon the subject.”

Sensible of the feelings which are excited in a Territorial population by the absence of their Civil Officers, I considered it due to the people of East Florida, to repair to my station at this time, & to evince at once, my intention of becoming a permanent resident among them—though aware previously to my departure from Connecticut in August, that it would not be in my power to hold a Court in October, or to do any official act, because Governor Duval, from whom alone, by the Act of Congress," I could receive the Oath of Office, was at Pensacola, distant from Augustine by water, in the usual track, about two thousand miles & by land, in the only practised route, through
<pb#575 />
Georgia, seven hundred & fifty. I could not expect therefore, to open my Court till the term of January, before which time it was confidently expected that the Governor, in the exercise of his official duties, would visit Augustine.
After my Arrival, & after becoming acquainted with the State of the District, I became satisfied with this result; because sure, that a term of the court at an earlier period, before the promulgation of the code of the Legislative Council—& while yet not only the forms of Law process, but the laws themselves were uncertain & unknown in East Florida—could in no respect, advance the essential interests of justice or of the Territory—That some suits indeed might be commenced, fees charged & court expenses incurred, without the possibility of progressing beneficially one step towards final judgment—& that in the interval, the laws might be received, forms of practice & rules of Court determined on, and digested views entertained, which would enable the Court to proceed with system, dispatch
& usefulness at the January Term.
But it has now become my duty Sir, to inform you, that the absence of Governor Duval from the Territory,” and the expectation entertained that he will not return to it again till about the first of May, will render it impracticable for me to be sworn into office, either in season for the January or April term of the Court. I take the liberty therefore, to suggest to your consideration, in behalf of the interests of the Territory, the propriety & necessity of legislative provision, at the earliest practicable day of the next session of Congress, empowering some person at this place, or any person, competent to administer oaths generally—to administer the Oath of Office to me.
Such provision Sir, would obviate the difficulty, which may repeatedly occur, from the restriction of this power, as the law at present stands, personally to the Governor.”
I consider it proper Sir, that the whole Subject may be before you at one view, & that there may be no supposition of neglect on my part, to repeat that my appointment of Judge was not made, till after Govenor Duval left Washington—That immediately upon my acceptance, I addressed him in duplicate at Pensacola," requesting to know the earliest time at which I might expect to find him in East Florida, where in conversation, previous to my appointment, he had informed me he should be in the course of the then ensuing summer, & where in my letter, I assured him, I would not fail to be at the earliest day which he should name. The Governor in reply, which reached me in August, gave me the information that his intentions were changed, & that he should probably not visit Augustine till
<pb#576 />
subsequent to an Indian treaty, which would occupy some time after the session of the Legislative Council.
After this information, if it could have been considered my duty to have travelled in pursuit of the Governor at the expense of a years salary several thousand miles, I still could not have found him in the Territory, as he would have left Pensacola before I could have reached it.
I have to offer in apology Sir, for the repetition of former letters contained in this, the doubt arising from distance & the uncertainty of the Mails whether those have yet been received—& the certainty of this reaching you safely by Col. Hamilton the Attorney of the U. S.
for East Florida, who will be able to give explanations in relation to the subject matter of this letter, on points wherein I May have been deficient."
I have the honour to be Sir With great respect Yr Most Obed"
Servit JOS. L. SMITH.

<place-time>NEAR PENSACOLA, November 4" 1822–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR; In consequence of the letter of the Secretary of State, of the 20" of August," in relation to the public buildings, I have requested Col: Clinch to give orders to the Quarter Master, to turn them over to the Executive of this Territory. I presume the Colonel has written to you," and enclosed copies of the communications which have passed between us upon the subject. The buildings have not yet been turned over to me; but it is to be expected, that they will be, in a short time, agreeably to the orders of the War Department.—
It seems, that some little doubt exists, as to what buildings, if any, should be considered of a military character. All the public buildings, except the prison and Hospital, were included within the old British Fort. Under the Spanish Government, the plan of that
15 See post, p. 592.
<pb#577 />
part of the town has been changed; The block houses now stand on the street, or on the public square, and excepting their form, they have nothing of a military character. Some of them it is true, were occupied, as quarters, by the Spanish soldiery, which was also the case with the buildings contiguous to the Government House; but the troops stationed here, were properly appendages to the civil authority of the Governor, who was the military and political chief of the Province. Since the troops of the united states have been removed from Pensacola, no use, I believe, is made of any of these buildings; but left entirely unoccupied. Two of the block houses, which stand in the street, ought to be torn down, or removed; but in the present poverty of the city and county, may be used, for a time, as public offices. Excepting the jail, which is a miserable building, all these edifices are of wood, and very old.—
Your letters of the 28" August,” and of the 18"" and 20** of September, with their several enclosures, addressed to Governor Duval, were received by me, on the 1* of this month. Upon the subject of Indian affairs, and particularly the treaty contemplated with those Tribes which reside in Florida, and to which your last communications relate, I have felt great solicitude, and exceedingly regret the absence of the Governor, of which, I presume, e'er this, you have been advised. I confess, that I do not see, in a manner satisfactory to my own mind, the relation in which the Secretary of the Territory stands to the Governor, as ex officio Superintendant of Indian affairs; neither do I understand clearly, the extent of my powers on this head, as acting Governor under the law of Congress.
Notwithstanding this doubt, I should consider it my duty to act, if there were any thing which the public service required to be done, and which might be in my power to accomplish; but upon this subject, I am entirely without means or instructions.”
It is unnecessary to state to you the situation of things in this section of Florida, in consequence of the dreadful pestilence which has prevailed in Pensacola. The sickness of my family, and of an esteemed friend (D" Bronaugh) who was confined at my house, detained me a considerable time, in the city, after the Legislative Council adjourned to Emanuel's. As soon as it was in my power to leave Pensacola, I
was compelled to provide a shelter for my family in the woods, to which their safety urged me to retire; and therefore, saw but little of
<pb#578 />
Governor Duval, previous to his departure for the state of Kentucky.
Having made no communications to me on the subject of the Indians, all the information I possess in relation to it, has been gathered from the documents and papers left in my charge by the Governor, upon his leaving the territory, and the communications from your Department by the last mail, the receipt of which has already been acknowledged.—
From the Talk sent by the Governor, to the Indians of Florida, and communicated to your Department, it appears, that the 20" of this month was appointed as the time of meeting at St Marks; and I
understand from a letter, lately received from Richards the Interpreter, and addressed to Governor Duval, that the Chiefs and all their warriors will assemble on that day. I was, myself, under the impression, that it was intended the Chiefs alone should be invited; and such would also seem to have been the understanding of Col: Eustis, as expressed in his letter to the Governor, of the 15" of September.”
Upon referring, however, to the letter of Governor Duval to you, of the 22" of September,” I understand that he has recommended, in the strongest terms, not to enter into any Treaty with the Indians this winter. This letter, connected with his departure for the state of Kentucky, without leaving me any instructions upon the contemplated negociation, induced me to believe, that the project, would, in all probability be abandoned, and in any event, that I should not be authorised to act, untill further advices were forwarded from the War Department.—
It would appear, from your letter of the 28* of August,” received with your communications on the 1* Instant,” that it was desirable the Governor should meet the Indians at the time and place appointed, and negociate a treaty with them, if it suited his convenience to accept of this special appointment; and if not, intimating that Capt. Bell would probably be deputed on that duty. I am now at a loss to know, whether, in pursuance of the suggestion of Governor Duval, the Government has determined on holding no treaty, and if otherwise, whether Capt. Bell, or some other person has received instructions to proceed to St Marks, and accomplish the objects of the negociation.
Unless a commissioner has been appointed, there will be no person authorized to meet the Indians in Council, and their assembling, must consequently, be productive of no valuable purpose. It was too late, even at the time of the Governor's departure from the Territory, to send word to the Indians, requesting them not to assemble, and giving the necessary explanations; and besides, I felt myself restrained from
<pb#579 />
the adoption of this measure, by the letter of Governor Duval, of the
22* of September, in which he says:—“I shall, however, direct the Indians to be assembled according to your desire; but hope that no treaty will be held with them, until this subject is further investigated.”
Even were it necessary for me to act on this occasion, and admitting it to be practicable from the situation of the country, I should be at a loss in making the preparations for supplying the Indians, or to know the nature and amount to be furnished at St Marks, as no funds have been placed at my disposal, and no instructions given me as a guide upon the subject Your letter of the 18" of September,” states that all these preliminary arrangements had been entrusted to Col: Humphreys, under the direction of Governor Duval, and that you hoped he would arrive in due time.” I have to inform you, that he has not yet reached Pensacola, nor have I heard what progress he has made on his journey.—
Another consideration which forbid my interference on this occasion, is, that on your receipt of the Governor's letter, informing your Department of his visit to Kentucky,” measures may have been concerted with Col: Humphreys and some other individual as Commissioner, on this subject, and perhaps any steps which might be taken by me would conflict with those adopted by the agents of the Government. By the next mail, I am in hopes to be advised of the determination of your Department, touching the suggestions of Governor Duval in his last communication.—
Should I receive no further advices from the War Department upon this subject, and an agent should not be appointed to meet the Indians in Council, there does not appear to be any thing in my power, except despatching a messenger to St Marks, with letters to the Commandant of the place, informing him of the state of things which has unfortunately grown out of the circumstances already detailed. Without any authority to act as a Commissioner in holding a treaty with the Indians, myself, it would be useless for me to go to St Marks. In the absence of the Governor, my public duties forbid it. My want of funds, also renders it impossible for me to make any preparations for supplying the Indians, who will probably, assemble at St Marks in great numbers. They will, no doubt, be greatly disappointed, and it is to be feared, much dissatisfied. How far it may have an effect in exciting a spirit of hostility, or interfer with any future effort at negociation, I cannot certainly anticipate. Upon an explanation to the Chiefs and Warriors, it is to be hoped that any difficulty will be obviated.”—

<place-time>NEAR PENSACOLA, November 5* 1822–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR; The dreadful calamity which visited Pensacola, this season, of which you have, no doubt, long since been advised, it will be readily imagined, has thrown great difficulties in the way of public business of every description. Every one who could leave the city, fled from the deadly pestilence; and in consequence of the small number of settlements in the country contiguous, many were obliged
<pb#581 />
to live in huts and tents through the woods, as the only means of safety. The sickness of my own family detained me for a considerable time in Town; and I was one of the last of the Americans to make my escape. Under such circumstances of distress and derangement, it has not been in my power to devote that strict attention, which I
could have desired, in discharging those duties in relation to the Government of the Territory, that have devolved on me, in consequence of the departure of the Governor for the state of Kentucky.
With regard to the publication of the laws, I regret to state, that it has been delayed very much against my wish; but from the situation of this section of the country, it was not possible to have the printing executed at Pensacola, and from the prevalence of Yellow fever at New Orleans, very little better prospect was presented in that quarter.
The desease having greatly subsided at this place, I am at this time, under the expectation, that a contract will be entered into with the printer of Pensacola, so as to have the work completed by the 10"
of January. The duty of contracting for, and superintending the printing of the laws, was imposed by an act of the Legislative Council, upon two of its own members, who it is understood, are engaged in making the necessary arrangements. Should they not be enabled to make a contract, so as to have the work completed at the time proposed, I shall take upon myself the responsibility of despatching a messenger to New Orleans, on this special commission, in order to be enabled, in time, to present to Congress a printed copy of the acts of the Legislative Council of this Territory. Owing to the great variety of subjects, on which it became necessary to legislate, the volume will consist of 3 or 400 octavo pages, and it is expected that the expence of printing will be considerable. In the event of failure to have the laws printed, as was contemplated, I shall proceed, without delay to have them copied, and confidently calculate upon being enabled to have them transmited to you by 1" of February.
I am now engaged in examining the copy made out by the directions of the Governor, and shall be prepared to deliver it to the printer, as soon as arrangements are made to progress with the work.
In the performance of my labours, it will be indispensibly necessary that I should have the assistance of a clerk. The additional duties imposed upon me, by the absence of the Governor, renders it almost impracticable for me to get on without such aid; but how he is to be compensated for his services, I am at a loss to determine, as it appears there is no provision made to meet the case in the act of Congress, organizing the Government of Florida. As soon as your convenience will permit, you will confer a favor by advising me upon this subject, as it is one upon which I feel considerable solicitude.
Amongst the papers and documents left in my charge by Governor Duval, was a bill, drawn by him on your Department, for the sum of
301867–57–37
<pb#582 />
3300 dollars, which, by his letter of advice, is to be appropriated in defraying the expences incured by the Legislative Council, and those incident to the publication of the Laws. This draft I have negociated with the House of F. H. Nisbet & Co *—and am, from time to time, applying the proceeds to the purposes for which it was intended.—
The public buildings have not yet been turned over to me by Col:
Clinch. A correspondence has taken place between us,” which I presume has been communicated by the Colonel to the Secretary at War, to whom I have written fully on the subject.” There was some difficulty in deciding what buildings were to be surrendered to the Executive of the Territory, and which retained, as being of a description purely military. I believe however, they will all be delivered over, agreeably to the request in my last letter to Col: Clinch, subject to the decision of the Secretary of War. For my own part, I do not think there ought to be any difficulty on this occasion; the block houses standing on the public square, are the only buildings which possess any thing of a military character, and that alone, on account of their structure and original use.
Several letters have been received from the Secretary at War, in relation to our intercourse, and a contemplated treaty with the Indians of Florida. These I have answered, to which I beg leave to refer you.
It will be seen, that some embarrassment and confusion have arisen upon the subject, which, to me, has been a source of no ordinary share of anxiety. I was extremely solicitous to do any thing within the compass of my power; but under the circumstances, I was altogether at a loss to determine what duties had devolved on me by the absence of the Governor, as superintendant of Indian affairs, or from the papers in my possession, to ascertain what measures could be adopted. This, I have more fully and explicitly explained in my communication to the Secretary at War.
I regret extremely, that Governor Duval should have found it absolutely necessary to be absent from the Territory at this particular juncture. During the prevalence of the fever, domestic duties of the most imperative and irresistable character, precluded me an opportunity of having scarcely any conversation with him, relative to Indian affairs; and almost all the information which I possess upon the subject, is derived from the correspondence between the Governor and the War Department, entrusted to my charge, upon his departure for the State of Kentucky; and from communications received from Mr Calhoun by the last mail.”—

<docbody>THE HON” THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES of U.
States:
SIR: The act of Congress, passed at the last session, for organizing a Board of Commissioners to ascertain claims and titles to land within the Territories of Florida,” requires, that our session should terminate at Pensacola, and commence at St. Augustine, by the first of January next. We have the honor to inform you, and through you, the honorable body over which you preside, that it will be altogether imprac-
<pb#584 />
ticable to bring our duties to a close in West Florida, within the time prescribed. In consequence of the fatality with which the yellow fever prevailed at Pensacola, the prosecution of our commission has been unavoidably suspended for more than three months. Such was its malignancy, that scarcely an American escaped who remained within the reach of contagion. Every description of business was, at length, almost entirely abandoned, and all who possessed the means, betook themselves to flight, as the only measure of safety. Under such circumstances, had we disregarded our own safety, such was the distress of the inhabitants, that the claimants could not have attended to the presentment of their titles. There are yet reported to be a few cases of yellow fever in Pensacola, which combined with the fact, that the weather continues warm and without frost, renders it doubtful whether we could return with impunity. As soon as we can obtain assurances to this effect, which are daily expected, our duties will be promptly resumed. We feel evry anxiety to progress, and to accomplish as soon as possible, the objects of our appointment.—
Under these circumstances, we would respectfully recommend, an extension of the sessions, both at Pensacola and St. Augustine. It will certainly require more time to complete the investigation of land claims in Florida, than at first anticipated. We would suggest an additional term of six months, for West Florida, with the power of adjourning should the business be sooner completed; as also such prolongation in that at St. Augustine, as the Delegate may deem necessary. He is no doubt, well informed upon the subject, and can give to Congress evry information which is desirable.—
Feeling the necessity of such a prolongation, and trusting that your honorable body will not hesitate to pass an act * authorizing the same, we shall continue to prosecute our duties at this place, until we hear what disposition Congress has made upon the subject. We would add, that the difficulty of transportation from this to St.
Augustine, renders it desirable that the business should be completed here in one session. This was, no doubt, the intention of the law, by which this board was organized. Again—the Commissioners, to prevent fraud, have resolved, that claims must be presented in the Province where the grant was made. Agreeably to this rule, they cannot follow us to St. Augustine."—

Hynes acted as Secretary from the time Mr W." Reynolds (who was his predecessor) quit, which was up to the day—Mr. Rynolds—drew his allowance,” this day can be easily seen by refference to his account
<pb#587 />
filed in the office of the secretary of state, you will see that the letter of appointment inclosed is dated on the 15" day of March 1822 But M. Hynes acted as Secretary, from about the first of January last, for Mr. Reynolds about that time left Florida and went to Georgia, but to whatever day up to which he was allowed for his services from that time ought M Hynes, allowance to commence, I recved a letter from Govenor Worthington some time last winter, in which he then informed he had imployed Mr. Hynes as his Secretary—he had no other Secretary after Mr. Reynolds but M* Hynes, who continued to act as such up to the 30" of May last—when he left St. Augustine and came with the counsel to Pensacola—I hope you will as soon as you receive this letter, get Judge Gaither and M. Hynes account allowed, and inform me as soon, as possible as Judge Gaither will return to Florida by the 1* of Jary next, he is just married in this neighbourhood. I believe that five Dollars per day has been allowed to all Secretarys who have acted in Florida If you could obtain a check on the United States Branch Bank at Louisville for the amount and inclose it to me, it would suit Judge Gaither & M Hynes better than to draw for the mony Mr. Worthington having retired from East Florida, it is not in Mr.
Hynes power to obtain his cirtificate—but I inclose Judge Gaithers affidavit on this subject” the reason why the letter of appointment was not given untill March, was, that Gov" Worthington, at first did not know how long Mr. Reynolds would be absent."

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF EAST FLORIDA</dochead>
<source>[NA;HF, 17 Cong, 2 sess.:DS"]</source>
<place-time>[November 29, 1822]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled The Memorial of the Subscribers, inhabitants of East Florida, respectfully represents:
That from the great extent of this Territory, and the distance and difficulty of communication between its Western and Eastern extremity, much inconvenience has been experienced by the union of the two Sections of the Territory under one local government. Great delays and impediments have been experienced in the meeting of the Territorial Legislature, the promulgation of the laws, regulations for elections and returns, and other important communications, connected with the Public welfare.
The Spanish Government, aware of the inconvenience which would result from the two Floridas being placed under one Government found it necessary to constitute two seperate and distinct administrations in the Country. Your memorialists, therefore, pray, that in East Florida a Government may be formed Seperate from and independent of West Florida, until the population of both Sections united, may be adequate to the formation of a State. Your memorialists are persuaded that such a measure would be highly beneficial to the welfare and prosperity of the whole Territory Your Memorialists further beg leave to represent, that although the cultivation of the sugar cane and other valuable productions of this country, afford a great and unprecedented inducement to the Settlement of planters in this Territory; yet the Situation of public affairs in the Territory has hitherto greatly discouraged settlers from coming in and forming establishments. One great obstacle to the settlement and improvement of the Country is the uncertainty which exists in regard to the titles to land, particularly on account of the claims of the United States. The delay which has taken place in adjusting and determining these Claims has been one of the most serious evils which this Country has experienced since the change of Government. By this means the population of the Country has been greatly retarded, persons desirous of forming settlements here, have been unwilling to make purchases of lands, under the embarrassed and uncertain claims of individuals and of the Government: and consequently, the property of individuals as well as that of the Government of the United States is experiencing a depreciation in value. Your Memorialists therefore pray that an Act be passed authorizing the immediate appointment of distinct and seperate land commissioners
<pb#591 />
for this Section of the Territory, to adjust and determine the claims of the Government of the United States, and to continue their sittings until all the Claims be disposed of.”
And Your Memorialists respectfully Submit, whether the expense attending the exhibition and proof of titles before such Commissioners ought not to be borne by the Government of the United States, rather than by the individuals, who are called upon to produce the same, in as much as the exhibition of documents, in these cases, are made at the call of the United States, and for their benefit Your memorialists further pray, that as it will take some time before the Land Commissioners will be able to adjust and determine all the claims to land in this Territory, that an Act of Congress be passed authorizing Citizens of the United States to settle upon the public lands, known as such, and where no individual claims are in opposition, giving public notice of the location, where the settlement is intended to be made, with permission to remain on the Same, paying to the United States the value which may hereafter be determined upon, in regulating the prices of the public lands in this Territory; and whatever improvements shall be made shall be for the benefit of the United States, should payment not be made accordingly *
Your memorialists further respectfully represent, that another cause of the Slow population of this Territory, and of which the inhabitants have much reason to complain, is the condition of the public roads.
It is a fact, that between this Territory and the State of Georgia, there is no land communication required by the ordinary intercourse between one State and Another. Your Memorialists therefore, submit this fact to the Consideration of Congress, in the confident hope that Some provision will be made for the opening and construction of roads and bridges Your memorialists further beg leave to Suggest, as a means of promoting the welfare and prosperity of this Territory and of the United States, that a Light-house be erected at the entrance of the harbour of S*Augustine, at S*John's River, Mosquito, and Key West,”
and a beacon at the South end of Lake George Your memorialists farther represent, that another and a very serious cause, impeding the population of this Territory, is the situation of affairs in regard to the Seminole Indians—a race of people whose habits and occupations are at variance with those of the other inhabitants of this Territory and with whom the mutual relations are not known or understood—Your Memorialists therefore pray that such convention, treaty, or arrangements may be made with these
<pb#592 />
Indians, as may be deemed fit and expedient, to ensure the tranquillity and security of this country Your memorialists further beg leave to State, that among the obstacles to the settlement of this Territory, may be reckoned the opinion entertained by many British Emigrants of the validity of their claims, under grants from the British Government, although those claims were proscribed by a Royal order of the Spanish Government soon after the cession of this Country to Spain by the British Government;
and those claims became absolutely extinct on the 2" day of October
1790 58
Your memorialists beg leave further to represent, that in their opinion the public welfare would be promoted by a general election of the members of the Legislative Council.
Your memorialists further respectfully represent, that they consider the Act of the Legislative Council of this Territory, passed at the late session in Pensacola providing for the levying of Taxes, as very objectionable, in as much as the taxes contemplated to be raised by that act, would, according to the best calculations, exceed the amount of the whole exports of the domestic produce of the Territory. A great proportion of these taxes are intended to be levied on lands, which are unimproved and unproductive, for the causes before mentioned, and these taxes necessarily have a tendency to discourage settlers.
Your Memorialists therefore pray that an Act of Congress may be passed, Suspending the Collection of these taxes, until the next meeting of the Legislative Council of this Territory.
Another Act of the Legislative Council passed at their late session, entitled “An Act providing for the election of a Delegate to Congress”
Your memorialists also consider as liable to very serious objection, because, by one of the provisions of that Act, the common Soldiers who may be in the Territory, without possessing the usual qualifications of voters, may exercise the right of suffrage, and by that means, forming a body which would in all probability be under the complete control of the officers, might, in defiance of the will of the other inhabitants of the Territory, at all times, decide the election. Your memorialists therefore pray that this evil may be remedied by an Act of Congress.”
Your memorialists beg leave to represent that the establishment of Inferior Courts of Justice in this Territory, except those of Justices of the Peace, is attended with much expense; and, until the population
<pb#593 />
of the Country considerably increase, might be rendered unnecessary, so far as regards the trial of civil and criminal causes, if Congress would extend the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to all cases where the Sum or value in controversy Should amount to fifty Dollars, giving that Court also appellate jurisdiction, by appeal, certiorari, and writ of error, from the decisions of the Justices of the Peace in all cases:—
and it would be greatly conducive to the ends of public justice, if an appeal could be granted from the judgment of the Superior Court, in all cases where the Sum or value, in controversy should amount to
$2,000 as in cases from the circuit courts of the United States under the Judiciary Act of 24" September 1789 "–

<place-time>Custom House STAUGUSTINE 3" December 1822</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. I take the liberty to inform you, that there are, under my charge, in the public store attached to the Custom House, eight large boxes of papers, which were taken, by direction of Mr Worthington, while acting here as Governor, from the house of the late Spanish Governor Coppinger. Many of these papers, it is believed, are of great importance in regard to the titles to land in this Territory.
<pb#595 />
The royal orders, upon which many grants of land were made, are said to be in some of the boxes: but were not found, on a very cursorary examination, which was made by the Commissioners appointed by Mr Worthington to look over the papers. Mr Reynolds, who has lately been appointed by Governor Duval to be keeper of the public archives * in this place, and who arrived here a few days ago, informs me, that he does not consider his Commission as extending to the charge of these documents. Under these circumstances and believing that a minute examination of these papers will throw much light on the subject of many of the grants of land in this Territory, I take the liberty, with great respect, of suggesting the propriety of authorizing Mr Reynolds (who from his knowledge of the Spanish language is well qualified for the business), to take charge of, examine, and make out an Inventory of all these documents, that persons whose interests may be involved in their authenticity may at any time have recourse to them.
I think it would be very useful to join with Mr Reynolds, or any other person who may be appointed to examine these papers, Mr Antonio Alvarez, who was for some time the Secretary of Governor Coppinger, and who is a gentleman of much respectability resident here, being now the President of the Board of Alderman of this City.”

<docbody>SIR; Before this reaches Washington, you will have received my communication of the 24" ultimo," informing you of the measures which I had adopted, for the purpose of furnishing the Indians with supplies, who were invited by the talk of Governor Duval, to meet him or the Indian agent in Council, at St. Marks, on the 20" of November; and to conciliate them, by explaining the causes which had produced a postponement of the negociation. By the mail before the last, I had the honor of receiving your letter, dated 23" of October,"
in which you express your approval of the postponement, for the reasons suggested by Governor Duval, and directs me not to take any steps for holding a treaty with the Indians, at the above-mentioned period. I should have replied to this communication immediately after its arrival; but considered it most advisable not to do so, until I
could ascertain the result of Maj. Wright's mission to St. Marks, which I have now the honor to communicate You will readily discover, that the steps which were taken by me, touching this transaction, had been adopted anterior to the receipt of your last letter.—
From the report of Maj. Wright, a copy of which I have enclosed, it appears that the course I have pursued, is calculated to accomplish the beneficial effects intended. Should not the supplies be distributed amongst the Indians, as contemplated; they may be used by the troops at St. Marks; in which event, the Government will be exposed to no additional expence. You will see from the reciept " of Lieut. Hutter,”
asst. Commy. of Sub. herewith transmitted, that the most advantageous arrangement has been made in the disposition of these provisions.
<pb#597 />
Under these circumstances, and for the reasons contained in my letter of the 24" of November, it is to be hoped, that what I have done may meet with the approbation of your Department.—
It is gratifying to learn from Maj. Wright's report, that there is no inclination amongst the Indians of Florida to commence hostilities with the whites, or amongst themselves, as intimated in a communication of M* Dexter to Colo. Eustis,” a copy of which has already been forwarded to the Department of War. I had previously, received a letter from Colo. Eustis, of the 22" of October,” in which he assures me, that the alarm amongst the Seminoles upon the subject, has been discovered to be wholly without foundation.
Colo. Humphreys has not yet arrived;" nor have I received any advices as to his movements, which will enable me to anticipate when he will report himself for instructions."—

PENSACOLA, 7th Dec 1822.
SIR: I have the honor to advise you of my return to this city, from St. Marks, last evening, after an absence of fifteen days. I was prepared to sail on the 18" Nov with the provisions, &c. for the Indians, ordered by Gov" Duval to assemble at St. Marks on the 20" of that month. A severe storm, however, prevented the vessel from leaving the port before the 21" On the 27" we reached St. Marks; where I
learned, three of the chiefs had promptly obeyed the order of the Gov" by attending at the time appointed. Not finding the Gov' or agent, they returned to their towns on the 23* I could then only assemble some of the neghboring chiefs, (among them Eneamathla,"
the principal of his nation) and deliver to them the talk with which you entrusted me; together with such other explanations, as were
<pb#598 />
necessary to convince them, that there was no disposition on the part of the Government, or of Gov" Duval, to neglect, disappoint, or trifle with them. Blount, Yellow Hair, and Turke-hayo, the chiefs who were at St. Marks on the 20" appeared, (as I was advised by the officers of the garrison) somewhat disposed to distrust the sincerity of the Government, on not finding the Gov" or agent, at the time and place appointed to hold the talk. Capt. Morris, commandant of the Fort, dispatched an Indian runner to Eneamathla and other chiefs, on the day of my arrival, with instructions to meet me the next day, (28 Nov.) which were promptly attended to. In the course of the day, Eneamathla, Olochtamica, Chificknico Hadjo, chief of Ocilleys,”
Forhachtimico, Leghlaficksico, and Hopoi Tuskamicksy arrived;
to whom I explained the causes of the Gov' or agent failing to meet at St. Marks, on the day appointed; and delivered to them your talk, through the Interpreter Hardridge,” with which they were well satisfied, notwithstanding the great anxiety expressed to know the exact situation in which they stand with the Government of the United States. The principal chief, Eneamathla, assured me, that he, his chiefs and warriors, would remain peaceable and contented, until an authorized agent should arrive, for the purpose of establishing a definite and durable understanding between them and the government.
The provisions intended for the Indians (expected to assemble at St. Marks,) I turned over to Lt. Hutter, acting asst. Com” of Subsistence, for the use of the troops or Indians, as the case might be; (they were then in want of them). the receipt of Lieut. Hutter, I send you herewith. Although these provisions were not made use of as intended, I am convinced they served to satisfy the chiefs whom I met, and through them the whole nation, that the Gov" was well disposed towards them; and would take such measures, as would ultimately secure to them their rights. And again,-the circumstance of their knowing the fact, that provisions were depositted at St. Marks, originally intended for their use, and now subject to their wants, under the particular directions and limits of the Secr'y of War, will have a strong tendency to make them remain peaceable and well disposed; particularly as their crops were extremely scant the last summer, and many of them they say, will suffer with hunger without aid from the Government.—
I feel fully authorized in assuring you, that no apprehension should be entertained of the friendly disposition of these Indians. They have no inclination to commence hostilities with the whites, or among themselves, as has been intimated to you. There is some considerable anxiety felt and expressed by the Whites, who have settled on lands
79 Presumably the Seminoles from Ocilla, a town on the east bank of the river of the same name in Taylor County.
30 James Hardridge.
<pb#599 />
comprehended in what is termed Forbes' grant, as to the probable result of the contemplated treaty with the Seminole Indians.
The understanding from the officers of the Fort and some citizens resident on the Apalatchicola, that a M. Richards, an Indian Interpreter, appointed by Gov" Duval, had, for some time past, been intriguing with Eneamathla and other chiefs, and exciting them to assert and maintain their right to the lands they now occupy, in order that he may obtain from them a tract of six miles square, which he says, they have promised him. I deemed it proper, under these circumstances, to say nothing to the chiefs on the subject; more particularly, as I had recd no instructions from you to do so.—
It is not necessary for me to go into a detail of the malconduct of this Richards; as Capt. Morris and M. Doyle, the latter a prisoner at the instance of Richards, both now in the city, will give you a full and candid statement. I would, however recommend, that he should not only be deprived of his present appointment, but be driven from the country; as I am fully convinced of his villainy, and disposition to excite jealousy and hatred in the Indians towards the honest white population, as well as the government of the United States.
I am, with high respect, Yr Mo. Obt:

<dochead>ALEXANDER HAMILTON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE</dochead>
<source>[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS]</source>
<place-time>WASHINGTON 15 Dec. 1822</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. I have found upon an examination of the correspondence from the Commissioners appointed under “An act for ascertaining claims and Titles to Lands within the Territory of Florida” that they consider it impossible, to transact the business entrusted to them, within the time prescribed, and invite the attention of Congress, to the necessity of passing a supplemental act, to extend their session.”
The malignant fever, which unhappily desolated Pensacola, is represented as the principal cause of interruption to the progress of their examinations. If in the slightest degree, the Grants in West Florida, partake of the exceptionable character of those in the East, it would be peculiarly injudicious to precipitate the Commissioners in the termination of their labours. When Congress legislated upon this subject they were possibly not aware of the numerous and extensive concessions made by the Governors of Florida and especially since the year 1815 and immediately anticedent to January 1818–
It is understood, that in East Florida, there are no less than twelve hundred Spanish and it is believed the British will not fall short of five hundred—
The peculiar munificence of the Grants said to be made by Governor White,” will require the most scrupulous investigation; the general reputation of that Gentleman being in direct hostility to any semblance of prodigality. The Royal order of 1815, confirmatory or perhaps more correctly, prospectively approbatory of the remunerative donations of Governor Kindeland,” to those who had shown their loyalty in the revolution of 1812 has been the foundation of the most preposterous extravagance by Governor Coppinger. Many individuals are the subjects of repeated Royal Bounty and in several instances, upon a remuneration of services, the pretexts of anticedent donations.
With these circumstances, certain to involve a mature investigation in difficulty and embarrassment, added to the alleged necessity of prolonging the Board of Commissioners in West Florida, it would be adviseable to create a new Board for similar purposes in East Florida.
The inducements for such an arrangement must appear evident, whether the immediate interests of individuals or the public be considered—on the score of economy the advantage to the nation although inconsiderate nevertheless preponderates. To private claim-
<pb#601 />
ants it will be but justice and absolutely important, for embarrassed as their property now is, every moment of procrastination, is to them a source of positive sacrifice. Those whose claims will most probably be confirmed cannot sell and dare not cultivate; while on the contrary those concessions, the magnitude of which, have naturally excited the jealousy of Congress, are constantly gaining consequence, as they become every day more the subjects of speculation to men of wealth, reputation and influence and whativer may be the result of their expectations, they will introduce settlers, hereafter to become pertinacious petititioners to the liberality and munificence of Government. The capability of this Country to produce the most valuable subjects of Culture, the sugar cane, the best sea Island Cotton, the Cuba Tobacco and all the tropical fruits, including the olive, with Oranges Limes and Lemons in great abundance and of superior quality calls for the most efficient and fostering attention. The salubrity of the climate is unquestionable, notwithstanding the extraordinary malady in Pensacola this year and in S*Augustine the last, in each of which places, the first appearance of the Fiver was preceded by a peculiarity of circumstances, at all times to be guarded against—
If, as it appears probable, from the statement of the Commissioners Mess. Ware and Overton, that their session will be extended, until the coming winter, and, as a period, equal to that, which will be necessary in West Florida, will be requisite in East Florida, two years will be the time to which the continuance of the present Board must be extended, provided the whole business be confided to them, at an expense of twelve thousand dollars; consequently if an additional Board be established and the same business can be done in half the time which will be consumed by the one, the charge upon the Government will be the same, while the public lands will be more speedily ascertained. - - -
The requisites of the present law operate with unexpected hardship upon the heirs and representatives of such persons who have held their lands by descent for centuries, particularly in the Cities where the public property has been designated with scrupulous accuracy in the official shedules and while the public can anticipate no advantage, individuals are to be put to great expense and exposed in the “deraignment” of their titles, to much subsequent vexatious litigation—
In most instances lands granted for Head Rights in conformity to the Royal order of 1791 exceed the number of acres to which the confirmatory powers of the Commissioners extend and as these grants are esteemed, as having been made in good faith it would be an equitable indulgence to individuals to have the powers of the Commissioners enlarged—
The Church of St Augustine built by, private and public contributions, has been transferred to the United States as public property, 
<pb#602 />
there never having been any grant or concession of it to the inhabitants, by the King or his authorized Agents—I have understood, that all the correspondence in relation to this subject between Governor Qusada" and the Court of Spain is to be found in the twelve Boxes of papers claimed to be public and as belonging to the King of Spain by Governor Coppinger—The building of the Church was certainly commenced by private contributions and finally completed by donations from the King—with the facts, the interference of Congress will be necessary, to confirm the right of the Church, to the Roman Catholic inhabitants of St Augustine.”
If Congress exempt antient grantees from the necessity of exhibiting, their titles, they can authorise the Commissioners in all suspicious circumstances to call for an exhibition *—

<docbody>SIR I feel it a duty incumbent on me acting as a public officer
& therefore take the liberty, especially as it seems the business of no person here in particular, to inform the government of the depredations committed on the public timber in this vicinity-
The lands on the Rivers & Bays immediately east of this place are fast settling by the description of persons called Squatters & the destruction of timber is very considerable; in many places however it is only of the ordinary qualities & therefore of less importance;
but there is on the several streams emptying into yellow water Bay among other places, a growth of Live oak & Cedar of singular beauty
& value, the latter of which in particular, being more easily hewn &
transported, is already in those places & even on the unsettled lands, in danger of total destruction, & will prove a loss to the navy, perhaps irreparable—
About two months since the mercantile house of Allen & Wilson of this place, dispatched the Brig Franklin with a full cargo of timber for Philadelphia, composed chiefly of this cedar, the great proffit &
perfect impunity of which operation are likely it seems to cause it to be renewed on an extensive scale—Mr Scott the Collector, who was
<pb#604 />
then at the head of this office from which he has since resigned and retired, had considered and consulted on the subject long before that occurrence, but discovered no lawful manner in which he could interfere to repress the practice—
It is for the wisdom of the Government to devise a remedy for this serious evil: I will myself however whilst upon the subject, presume so far as to suggest that there are points at which small military posts, authorized by an Act of the last session,” may be established very advantageously for that purpose at no inconvenient distance from this place: though this timber being chiefly cut for shipment abroad
& coastwise & having therefore of necessity to pass under the notice of the custom house in most cases, by the officers of which the facts may with no great difficulty be ascertained, an Act making it their duty to interfere in an efficient manner, would probably be more effectual, provided it is not permitted by such means as petitions to procure the appointment of men, whom respectable persons are in this way sometimes induced inconsiderately to recommend, not feeling or finding themselves immediately interested in this as in other respects, to do their duty *—

SIR—I this day received your letter, containing authority and instructions for publishing the laws.” I accept this commission with thankfulness; and shall endeavour, by a proper course, to merit the approbation of the department. I also gladly embrace the opportunity of sending my papers from the commencement; though from our present isolated situation and the depression under which we have laboured, and do still labour, there is not much contained in them, either of a local or general nature. There are many things which require the attention of Congress, before we can expect to emerge from the state which I have alluded to, and any efforts, which can reasonably be made by the department, I am sensible will be meet with grateful feelings by the inhabitants of this Territory.

<docbody>SIR. I have the honor, herewith, to enclose you a correspondence, between Lieut Col. Eustis commanding at this Post, and Waters Smith Esqr Mayor, of the City, relative to some property belonging to the United States.
I am also directed by Lieut. Col. Eustis to give you a statement of facts concerning this property.
In the distribution of the public property in this city, between the civil & military authorities, after specifying some particular lots that should belong to the civil, and some, to the military departments, the President of the United States, directed that “all other public property should be in charge of the military department.—The civil authorities have, long since, been formally put in possession of those lots & buildings which were assigned to them;-but, not content with this, and regardless of the orders of the President, the municipal authorities, have wrested from the hands of the military, a portion of the property committed to their charge;—during the absence of Col Eustis and
<pb#606 />
entirely without my knowledge, they possessed themselves of the house and lot, known by the name of the “Dragoon Barracks,” rased the building to the ground, and disposed of the materials for the benefit of the city. They have, also, publickly offered to rent a tenement known as the “Smithy” which is now, and always has been in the actual occupancy of the military. These two buildings were both turned over by the Spanish authorities to the U.S. and by what title or upon what plea, the city claims them I am unable to say. The Mayor in his letter (B) states that these two buildings are entirely detached from the fort or barracks;–the former is so, but the latter almost immediately adjoins the fort, their being only a small smithy between them, erected and claimed by the late Spanish Royal Armourer,-I know not by what right or tittle.
There are three small tenements on the eastern extremity of the public square, that have always paid, to the Spanish Government a ground rent;—since they have been in possession of the United States, I have exacted & received, a similar rent.—I am unofficially informed that the corporation has forbidden the occupants, to make any further payment to the U. S. and that they intend to prosecute me for the rent, which I have already received.
It is entirely impossible, that the corporation was not aware that the above property was in charge of the military authorities, as, I, myself, informed the mayor of it.
The claims of the city authorities are so undefined, that I do not know, where they will cease, but, they appear disposed to extend them to all the property within the bounds of the city, for they already talk, of having the Fort for a penitentiary, the magazine for a Gaol, and the S* Francis Barracks for a college.”

SIR. I have been unofficially advised, that the Corporation of the City of St. Augustine, has taken possession of a portion of the publick property of the U.S. committed to my charge by the President;-has caused the building known by name of the “dragoon Barracks” to be pulled down, & the materials to be disposed of, &
has offered to rent the building known as the “Smithy” now in the actual occupation of the military.
Entertaining a full respect for the authorities of the city, I take the liberty to solicit of you official information on this subject, and to enquire on what ground the corporation of the City claims the right, of disposing of property of the U.S. which has been positively placed, by the order of the President in charge of the military.
I have the honor to enclose a copy of my instructions in relation to this property and am With high respect &" &"

WATERS SMITH Esqr. Mayor of St. Augustine Waters Smith to Abraham Eustis
(Copy) CITY OF STAUGUSTINE 26th December 1822
DEAR SIR, In reply to your letter of the 11* instant. I have the honor to State, that the property to which your enquiries have reference, is Considered in the legal possession of the Corporation of this City and subject to its Controul and disposition on the ground of ownership.
A special detail of title will not now be deemed necessary; It is sufficient to remark, that by the laws of Spain applicable to this Country, in relation to the laying out and establishment of Towns;
upon principles which apply to the City in its Corporate Character, and from the public Archives, facts and usages which relate to it, the Corporation views its title as most satisfactory and valid.
It is due Sir, to the authorities of the City, that I should observe, that in the Course taken in respect to this property, they have not been actuated by the most distant intention of infringing on Military right; Their interest and feelings would lead them, equally to avoid collisions, and to cultivate the most harmonious understanding with the military functionaries stationed at St Augustine. It was not to be supposed that an unoccupied and uninclosed lot near the Centre of the Town and the building upon it termed in your letter the
“Dragoon Barrack,” in a state of such dilapidation as to Cause it to be deemed a nuisance; or that the dwelling house, “known as the Smithy” tenanted by a single family, situated in a populous part
<pb#608 />
of the City, and like the Dragoon intirely seperate and distinct from the fort and the Barracks occupied by the Troops under your Command, should have been Considered by the Corporation of S*Augustine as Committed to “Military charge by the President of the United States” As little did it seem from facts known, that the Corporate authorities, even on principles of Courtesy, were called upon to communicate with the military Commandant, before the Steps mentioned in your letter where taken by them.
Their way appeared clear; the property belonged to the City, and they were not aware of any existing Military claim. In addition to these considerations, if any thing more were necessary, they acted under the authority of the Governor of the Territory.
It cannot Sir, be admitted by me as Mayor of this City, nor will the Constituded authorities thereof be induced to believe, that on the exchange of Goverments because the property in question, like the public square the Cathedral and City market house, fell under military Controul, that the City is thereby divested of its title or, that such property legally Continued subject to martial rule, after the establishment here of distinct Civil powers: I must add also, in relation to the order from the War Department, (a copy of which you have been good enough to furnish me) that while I express the utmost deference and respect for the official station of the Secretary of War: I cannot for a moment subscribe to the assumption, that he is authorized to dispose of the rights of this city; to distribute or Controul its property. or to direct it to remain in Charge of the military or of any other Authority.
Our Government Sir, is a Government of Laws, not of persons.
By your letter however, and by the above order I am informed, that by direction from the President of the United States Communicated through the Secretary of War you stand charged with this property.
In our personal Interviews Prior and subject to the letter I understood you to say, that you were willing and desirous to be released by the War department from this charge and that the possession of the Property was not necessary to the accomodation of your troops.
In this view of the Subject and after what I have written in reply to your enquiries; asserting the rights of the City, I cannot but consider it proper and adviseable for me as Mayor thereof, in order that hereafter there may be no misapprehension or Collision on this Subject between the Military and City authorities to request of you; which I
do respectfully and formally, to make application to the Department of War, for further instructions in relation to this property, and for authority hence forward to Consider yourself discharged from the possession and Controul of all Buildings, lots and property belonging to this City.
<pb#609 />
I have the honor to be Sir, with great respect and most sincere personal regard Your Obdt Servt

DEAR SIR. I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday in reply to mine of the 11" inst.
I had hoped to receive a more categorical answer, to the question I
had proposed.—I neither expected, nor wished so elaborate a replication to a note which I addressed to you in all possible frankness, and which remained fifteen days unanswered,—I must not, & will not be drawn into a discussion of claims to property.—I profess a full respect for the constituted authorities of the City, and flatter myself, that I
have as much at heart its permanent interests and future prosperity, as any one residing within its limits;-But I am here officially charged by the government of the U.S. with the care of certain buildings lots
&° turned over to them, by the late Spanish authorities, as belonging to the sovereignty; and it is not for me to decide whether or not this was done with propriety.
The Corporation of the City has thought proper to wrest a portion of this property from my possession;—I have not offered, nor do I
intend to offer, the slightest resistance to this procedure; All that I
have now to do, is to submit this correspondence, with the facts in relation to it, to the Department of war, and I entertain no doubt that I shall, in consequence, receive further instructions, in relation to this property.
I beg you to accept both personally & officially, the assurance of my esteem & respect.

<place-time>BALTIMORE 7th Jan 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In compliance with the request of Mr Maury's letter of the
3” Inst,” received last night, I do myself the honor to Report to you, on the case of Antelme Gay, as follows
<pb#613 />
On the 2" day of October 1821, I appointed Mr Gay & Mr Bird Clerks to the Commission of J. R. Bell, J. G. Forbes & Edmund Law Esq” to demand and take into their possession the public Documents
& Archives witheld by the Spanish Escribano & Governor of East Florida—He (Gay) attended first at the Escribano's which was about
4. O'clock in the afternoon & also at the Governor's which took him a walk of about 400 yards & about two or three hours attention, for the papers were taken into possession, pretty much in bulk & very little clerkship done about them—The next day early in the morning, I superceded Mess" Gay & Bird by appointing, three Secretaries Mess” Bethune, Lynch & Reynolds—So that for his Clerkship, Mr Gay ought not to be entitled to more than half a day's pay, say $2—
His Stationary account, was to the best of my memory $13.50–
perhaps one dollar more or less—But to cover two or three small charges, brought by other persons for removing the Archives &c I
put down, on some paper, sent to the Department of State, to the best of my recollection “Stationary $20–
Next, as to Mr Gay's Secretaryship—on or about the 12" day of October, Mr Bethune, one of the Secretaries having determined to leave S" Augustine & return to Amelia Island where he lived, I supplied his place by appointing Mr Gay—So that from the taking possession of the Archives say from the 3" day of October to the 12"–
of the same month, Mr Bethune acted as Secretary—Mr Gay from that last date to the close of the Commission, on the 5" day of November—
I have to rely for the aforegoing Report entirely on my memory having neither papers nor Memoranda on the subject: But I repose with much confidence in this statement—Whence it results that Mr Gay, stood on the same ground as Mr Bird one of the Clerks (since dead) and Mr Bethune one of the Secretaries—And may be entitled according to my recollection to be paid the following items-
1” half a day's clerkship say . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 2.00
2* Stationary say . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.50
3” Secretaryship 22—days at $5.00 per dy being from the
12 of Octr to the 5. of Novr— . . . . . . . . . . 110.00
$125.50
I found Mr Gay in Florida—He is a Frenchman, a merchant, of good sound talents & I think went to Florida about the time of the Apollo's business on the St Mary's.
He had become under the Spanish Government, the holder of at least ten or twelve pretty choice tracts of land amounting to upwards of ten thousand acres—He spoke the English, French & Spanish languages well—I appointed him an Alderman, afterwards Clerk &
Secretary as above, & lastly Public translator; the three former rather as places of confidence & trust, than as matters of profit-He had
301867-57–39
<pb#614 />
become a Spanish Subject, but was naturalized an American Citizen under Gen' Jackson's 3" Ordinance.—
Mr Gay, in his letter, seems to me, taking all things into consideration, to make more fuss about his services & his small stationary account than was necessary-All the papers & claims were instantly forwarded to the proper Department by the late Secretary & Acting Governor, who thinks Mr Gay, unjust, in impugning his Conduct in this particular, in the slightest manner—
If any further explanations be necessary I am willing & ready to give them at any time *—with distinguished consideration &c W. G. D. WORTHINGTON

my salary independent of recording the claimants papers is $1250 the Department having protested by Bill for the first quarter of that sum, I have not only lost six months labor in the most laborious & difficult office in this Territory but have actually paid money for the U States I understand I should have drawn upon the Treasurer & not the

<place-time>PENSACOLA, January 9" 1823 SIR, About the first of Dec Capt. Morris” arrived at this place from St. Marks, with E. P. Doyle, as a prisoner, who had been arrested on the Apalatchicola, in obedience to an order of Gov. Duval, and directed to be brought to Pensacola for trial. Upon his being arraigned before the District Judge, he was discharged. The expences incured by Capt. Morris in this transaction, have been paid by me, agreeably to the Account he presented, which, together with his receipt, are herewith enclosed.</place-time>
<docbody>On the 22" Dec the Seminole Chiefs, Blunt and Tuskiharjo, with eight warriors, and the Interpreter Stephen Richards, reached this place. These chiefs had attended at St. Marks on the 20" November;” but believing that no treaty would be held, returned home, before the arrival of Major Wright with the talk & provissions. The object of their visit here, was to learn the causes which had produced a failure of the contemplated negotiation, as well as to be informed what measures the Government intended to adopt in [MS. torn] this subject. They manifested much solicitude in relation to a Treaty;
but upon explaining to them the talk sent to St. Marks, & assuring them that the government would attend to their wishes, they departed fully satisfied”—
In your letter of 28” Augt.” you inform Governor Duval, that you had directed five Hundred dollars to be remitted to him, to pay
20 See DuVal to the Secretary of War, Feb. 14, 1823 (NA, OIA, SW Lets. Recd.)
introducing Capt. George N. Morris, late commandant at St. Marks, and stating that Morris could supply information about that section of the territory. DuVal further commented that Morris had concerned himself with the conciliation of the Indians and believed him entitled to compensation.
<pb#618 />
Stephen Richards for his past services as Interpreter; after which, a surplus would remain, to be appropriated to other purposes. Of this sum I have not recieved any advices, and have presumed it never was forwarded. Richards being a poor man in want of money, and having advanced the funds necessary to defray the expences of himself and the Indians in coming to Pensacola, I felt myself authorized under the authority of your letter, to pay him three hundred dollars, in part satisfaction for his services, and to appropriate the ballance to the liquidation of Capt Morris's accounts and the expences of the Indians and Interpreter whilst at this place and returning home. Alltogether, these payments have not exceeded the five hundred dollars which it is to be supposed, were intended to be applied to these objects—
Being entirely without money belonging to the Indian department, at the time these accounts were presented, they were met by arrangements which I hope will meet your approbation. The accounts of Capt Morris were paid out of other public funds in my hands, and for the purpose of replacing this amount, and covering the sums paid Richards for his services, and the expences incident to the visit of the Indians and their return home, I was under the necessity of drawing a draft on your Department, in favor of F. H. Nesbit & Co. for four hundred and eighty dollars and Eighty eight cents. It appeared to me, that Justice and good policy required that these accounts should be paid, and to accomplish this object, no other measure suggested itself as more advisable than the one which I have adopted. The receipts of Sebastian Barrios and Stephen Richards are forwarded with this communication—
Colo. Humphreys the Indian agent, arrived and reported himself on the 24" Ultimo. Agreeable to instructions,” he has made out his Estimates for the first quarter in advance, from the first of January, and which form the basis of those inclosed.” At present, no place has suggested itself as so eligible for his location, as St. Marks, He will shortly remove to that post, where he will be more immediately in the neigborhood of the Florida Indians. It is not to be expected, however, that he can accomplish much, until he receives funds, which will enable him to make suitable presents to their head men and Warriors”-

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the Receipt, by the last mail, of your order of the 6*Ult” relative to the public buildings in Pensacola, with reference to your order of 19* July last,” and directing me to report what disposition has, in conformity with that order, been made of them: in answer to which, I have the honor to report as follows.
For the disposition made of the Government House in July last, and untill the removal of the Troops from Pensacola, I beg leave to refer you to my communications of the 4* and 18” August last,” the latter in answer to your order of 19* July previous. Since the removal of the Troops, and as soon as required by, Col: Walton Secretary & Acts Governor of the Territory of Florida, on the 1* December past, I
delivered the Government House to him.
The Prison, has always since the possession of the Territory by the United States been at the disposal of and occupied for its necessary purposes by the Civil Authorities, and is now in their possession.
There is no public building in Pensacola known as the Custom House which can be claimed by the Civil Department: The Officers of the Customs have pretended a claim to one of the Block Houses which is said to have been occupied as a Custom House during the existence of the Spanish Authorities here. This Block House has, by the order of Colonel Clinch commanding been delivered to the Custom House Officer here for the temporary accomodation of his Department, and is held subject to the orders of, the War Department, or the Commanding Officer.
One other of the Block Houses has also, by the order of Colonel Clinch, been delivered to, the Mayor of the City, for such purposes of his Office as he may apporepriate it; and is also to be returned, in like order as received, to the orders of, the War Department, or of the Commanding Officer.
<pb#621 />
The other two Block Houses which were occupied by the Troops as quarters, I now occupy as Store Houses: and the three other Block Houses on the Skirts of the town remain unoccupied.
The Hospital, has lately been taken possession of by the Agent of a Citizen who sets up a claim to it under a British grant: I have taken the necessary measures to eject him; which will be executed in the course of a few days.

<place-time>PENSACOLA, 21" January 1823.</place-time>
<docbody>COL. GAD. HUMPHREYS, Indian Agent.
SIR. In a letter from the War Department, dated on the 19" of August last, the Governor of this Territory was, advised that you had been directed to repair to Florida, and report yourself to him for such instructions as he might deem necessary to insure a just and faithful discharge of the various duties which will arise in your intercourse with the Indians.” In the absence of the Governor, who is, ex officio.
Superintendent of Indian Affairs, the performance of this duty has devolved upon me, which I shall now proceed to discharge as far as I
am enabled from the information in my possession. I regret, on this occasion, the absence of the Governor, whose opportunities, for private conference with the Secretary of War upon the subject, and whose experience in Indian Affairs whilst here, would have enabled him to supply any deficiencies which may well be supposed to arise, in consequence of my information having been gleaned from correspondence which remains in my office, and, one or two conversations with Indian Chiefs.—I have every confidence, however, that these deficiencies will be supplied by a sound discretion on your part, and that you will, in all cases, exercise it to the intire satisfaction of the superintendent, and of the Government.—
Until Congress, by treaty or otherwise, shall have settled the future location of the Florida Indians, it is impracticable to designate any
<pb#622 />
place for your permanent residence.” For the present, considering the mutual convenience of the Indians and Agent, it is believed that St. Marks combines the most advantages. You will, therefore, as soon as convenient, repair to that post; and when you shall have become settled, and Sufficiently acquainted with the Indians, their views and wishes, you will, from time to time, report to the superintendent every thing you may conceive interesting in regard to those tribes. In discharging this branch of your duty, you are desired to communicate your opinions as to the best means of introducing amongst the Indians, the habits and employments of civilized life and of instructing them in the improved processes of Agriculture, which have been adopted by our own countrymen. You are also required to use your best exertions, within the pale of your authority, to prevent animosity and dissention amongst themselves, and to suppress apprehensions of severity or injustice from our Government, and of violence from the Creek Indians. By these means you may be very instrumental in preserving peace, and a spirit of conciliation between them and the United States, and afford to the Government suggestions important to the welfare of those tribes, and to the cause of humanity.
It will be necessary, in your intercource with the Indians, to employ one or more Interpreters, who will reside at such place, or places as you shall designate, and recieve such compensation as you may contract to give, not exceeding one dollar per day. In making a selection, it is particularly recommended, that the individual who is to perform this duty, shall be of good moral character, and otherwise entitled to the most implicit confidence. Until this is satisfactorily ascertained, it would not, it is concieved, be advisable to make the appointment for any definite time. As some dificulties have arisen between M*
Richards, the present Interpreter, and E. P. Doyle, it will be your duty to make yourself acquainted with the facts in relation to it;
and if, at any time, you shall be satisfied that M. Richards is not qualified for his station, upon application, to the Superintendant another will be appointed. With regard to M.” Doyle, should you discover that his deportment is such as will authorize you to remove from the nation in which he resides, you will do so as promptly as possible—
Capt. Pelham, late of the army of the United States, has been appointed Sub-Agent,” and is subject to your controul. He is required to make his reports and communications thro' you to the Superintendant, unless when attended with inconvenience or delay;
<pb#623 />
and will be paid by you quarterly or by the Superintendant if more convenient. Capt. Pelham is understood to be absent, at present, by permission of the Secretary of War, in consequence of bad health.”—
When remittances are recieved, funds will be placed in your hands, to be appropriated in paying the Sub Agent, for presents to the Indians, and for contingencies, At the close of each quarter, it is made your duty to render to the Superintendant your account with vouchers for all disbursements, which must be accompanied by a general abstract of disbursements within the quarter; detailing under distinct heads the various objects of disbursements, as pay of subAgent, Interpreters, presents, rations, &c, &c, so as to leave as few as possible to be embraced under the head of contingencies. You will also add a statement shewing the names of all persons employed by you as Interpreters, and in every other capacity, together with the amount of wages paid them respectively.—
You will have observed from the tenor of the Act of Congress, and the Instructions to the Superintendant submitted to your inspection, that the most rigid economy is required in all disbursements, and the strictest exactitude in rendering accounts. It is necessary that the accounts of the Agent should be forwarded to the Superintendant at an early period; particularly that of the quarter ending on the 30"
September to enable the latter to make out a statement of his accounts.
which are to be deposited in the post office on that day.—As Agent you have authority to grant temporary licences to trade with the Indians, which should be exercised with the greatest caution, in strict conformity with the act of Congress, and with every possible care to prevent fraud, or the introduction of ardent Spirits amongst them.
You will keep copies of all the licences, and regularly return them with the Securities, to the Superintendant.—
In calling your attention to these particulars, with a refference to the acts of Congress, which more minutely explain your several duties, accompanied by the enclosed forms of an abstract of expenditures, and a Quarterly Estimate, I believe I have furnished you with every necessary instruction, at present in my power; but if any thing material has been omitted any future application for further information connected with this subject will be attended to promptly and with pleasure."—
I have the honor to be, Yr. Mo. obt Sert.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor herewith to enclose a note which I addressed to the Assistant Quarter-Master accompanied by his Estimate of the probable expense of opening a road from Pensacola to St. Augustine by the troops of the United States including their extra pay per day together with his suggestions as to the most practicable route between those two places. Capt Burch appears to have a personal knowledge of the Country only from Pensacola to the Suwanee and estimates the whole distance to St. Augustine at 462 miles. From information in my possession there is very little doubt but that this calculation may be reduced by crossing the bay immediately at Pensacola and pursuing a direct course so as to intersect the old Spanish road not far from the Mikasuky towns. The only object in taking the circuitous direction of Fort Crawford * is to avoid the Bay and the swamp of its tributary streams; and this difficulty may be obviated by adopting the measure above suggested. Should the government however determine to open the road I would respectfully recommend that before it is commenced one or more suitable persons who are well acquainted with the Country & its localities be selected to make such an examination as may be necessary to obtain a correct report relative to the most advisable route.
It is very desirable that the road should be opened and it ought to be done with a care & economy calculated to render it a permanent establishment. The union harmony and intercourse of East & West Florida would be sensibly promoted by the accomplishment of such an important undertaking; it would greatly contribute to the wealth
& population of the intervening territory and by the enhanced value of the publick lands save to the government more than it will have
<pb#627 />
expended. The calculation of the cost as represented by Capt Burch is a liberal one and if opened in a direct route and upon the most suitable ground I have no doubt that such a road as is contemplated by the Quarter Master when finished will fall short of the expense as stated in his estimate—
Col. Humphreys the Indian Agent embarked from Pensacola on the 27" instant for St. Marks, Upon his reporting himself at this place for instructions they were made out & presented to him as directed by your several communications to the Governor of Florida.
In framing them I availed myself of the best information in my reach
& hope every thing was communicated to Col. Humphreys upon the subject of his duties which was necessary as a guide in their execution.
A copy of them is enclosed *—
You will also receive herewith an account and receipt of Maj.
Thomas Wright of the army of the United States for services therein specified.” Although I had no publick funds in my hands, I had no hesitation in liquidating the account as the services had been faithfully rendered and the charge a moderate one. It would be acceptable to be able to learn as early as convenient, how this sum will be refunded *—
I have the honour to be Your obedt servant—
GEO WALTON Secretary &c. &c—

[Enclosure]
Acting Governor Walton to Daniel E. Burch
- PENSACOLA Jamy 30th 1823.
SIR, Governour Duval in a letter addressed to the Secretary at War on the 18" July last" suggested the propriety of employing the United States troops in opening a road between Pensacola and St Augustine. In reply to this communication M* Calhoun in a letter bearing date the 19" day of August * acknowledges the importance of the road and that the military force of Florida might be usefully employed in such a work “but as it would be attended with considerable expense it cannot be done without the authority of Congress”
In a subsequent letter of the 28* August addressed to the Governour of Florida * the Secretary at War remarks “Since my answer to you
<pb#628 />
of the 19* instant in relation to your proposition for opening a road between Pensacola & St. Augustine. I have thought it probable that the expenses of merely opening the road would not be great; and if you will transmit to me an Estimate of the probable amount of the Cost including the extra pay of the soldiers, (an Estimate of which you may obtain from the Quarter Master) I will decide upon the subject and apprise you of the decision”—
Until your arrival in this place within a few days past, no opportunity has been afforded for opening a correspondence with you on this subject or for obtaining the estimate referred to in the letter of the Secretary at War. Not being minutely advised myself in relation to the topography of the country through which it is contemplated to open the road and having learned that you are acquainted with a considerable part of it from personal observation you will confer a favour by communicating to me at as early a period as practicable all the information you possess in relation to this important undertaking I should be glad to procure from you also such an Estimate as is mentioned in the letter of the Secretary at War together with a particular description of the Country through which the best &
most practicable route can be obtained I have the honour to Your Mo obedt Servant

Estimate for Opening Road
[January 30, 1823.]
Estimate of the probable expense of opening a Road from Pensacola to St. Augustine, by the labor of the Troops.-
For their extra 15 Cents per day . . . . . . . . . . . $6930.—
66 do. Gill of whiskey . . . . . . . . . . . . . 924.—
“ the expense of the necessary teams to accompany the troops . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4000.—
“ the transportation of provisions and other supplies to different points of deposit on the Route . . . . . 7000.—
Amount, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $18854.—
From Pensacola via Fort Crawford to the Choctawhatchie there is a Waggon Road, a distance of 172 miles, requiring only the repair of the Causeways & two or three small bridges;—from thence the Road should be opened direct to the Achesee Bluffs on the appalachicola, -
thence until it intersects the old Spanish Road (now grown up,) near
<pb#629 />
the Mickasukee Towns, leaving St. Marks about 20 miles to the South, and continuing on it to St. Augustine, crossing the St. Johns at Fort Picolata, from whence there is a Road to St. Augustine. It is about
290 miles from the Choctawhatchie to St. Augustine, making the whole Route 462 Miles, in which distance there would be about 240
miles of new road to open, provided this Route is approved; & I will here take occasion to remark that it is the nearest practicable Route;—
From this place to the Suwannee I have a personal knowledge of it.
In making this estimate I have calculated that the Road will be opened only wide enough for a waggon to pass with ease, & experience proves that such Roads, being shady, are most proper for a Southern climate.—The provisions for the troops ought to be transported by Water & placed in deposit at Fort Crawford, at the crossings of the Yellow Water, Pea River, Choctawhatchie, and Appalachicola, at Fort St. Marks & at the crossings of the Suwannee & the St. Johns.—

<docbody>SIR I am requested by the Corporation of this City to address you on the subject of our debts—contracted by the former Council, during the year 1821—These debts principally arose during the prevelence of the Yellow Fever in the summer of that year, & were unavoidable, in consequence of the distressing malady that raged with such violence and mortality: and its victims were strangers; emigrants from the U. States: I believe there was not among its victims a solitary native of Florida. Under the American Authorities that City Council were organized; not one Cent of money was in the City Treasury, and no means of raising any; many of the sick were without the necessaries of life; The City Council were compelled to establish a Hospital, provide Physicians, nurses &" &” Bury the Dead, and provide for the suffering poor; taxes were levied, but the distresses of the inhabitants were such that their collection was very properly suspended; &
finally on the 7” May 1822 Congress passed an act, prohibiting the Collection of taxes by the Corporation of this City.” The pecuniary distresses of this place are great: While this Territory was a Spanish Province, the principle City expences were paid from the Royal Treasury; and a number of our present inhabitants derived their support from the same source: being in the employ of the Spanish Government; that employ ceasing, those inhabitants tho’ not a charge to the City, are not in a situation to contribute towards the payment of Corporation debts that arose from an excessive influx of the lower class of Citizens from the United States. As I have above stated, there was no money in the Treasury when this Territory was transferred to our government; The Corporate Authorities of this City loaned to the Kings Treasurer $3.200.—previous to the Treaty of
1819—which has not, and I presume never will be repaid—
The amount of the Corporation debts above referred to are Two thousand seven hundred and ninety five Dollars eleven Cents—And the Corporation of this City indulge a hope that the President of the United States will be pleased to authorise the above sum to be paid out of monies appropriated by an act of Congress of 3" March 1821 *
for carrying into execution the Treaty between the United States and Spain *

<place-time>WASHINGTON CITY 17th Feb" 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. Having understood, & with much regret, that a Bill which is now before the House of Representatives, entitled “A Bill amending, and supplementory to, the Act for ascertaining claims and titles to lands in Florida, and to provide for the Survey and disposal of public lands in Florida,” is likely to be rejected by the Senate. And knowing, Sir, how important it is both to the interest of the United States
& to the Territory which I have the Honor to represent, that it should be adopted. I beg leave respectfully, to annex hereto, Copy of part of a Letter which I have received from Mr. Nathaniel A Ware, one of the Commissioners appointed to settle land claims in that territory, with a request, that you will lay it before the Senate, and which, together with a Memorial from the Inhabitants of East Florida addressed to the Senate & House of Rep" "praying, Among other things, for the Appointment of An additional Board of Commissioners to settle their land Claims. I hope & trust, will prove sufficient to convince the Senate of the propriety of allowing the appointment of an additional Board of Commissioners, and to allow also the other salutary provisions contained in that Bill, –the title of which is herein quoted—
Copy.— PENZACOLA 27th December 1822.
SIR: I take the liberty to address you, as the Delegate from Florida—relative to the Board of Commissioners for deciding on Titles to lands in Florida.—The Commissioners have done nothing as yet, first on account of the sickness at this place—and since because we cannot agree, at all, upon the principals that are to guide us in our decisions: (there being but two of us, the third not having come on yet) I feel bound to give the Treaty and act of Congress a liberal
<pb#640 />
construction—But, the other commissioner Strickly, for the fulfilment of all the conditions and for great regularity in the grants, neither of which have been much attended to by the Spanish Government.—
I will take us most of this year to close our business at Penzacola—I
think therefore that you aught to get an other Board appointed for East Florida—It will cost no more than if the same board done it all—
and there will be no confusion in the Records—for two sets of Books will have any how to be kept, one for each Florida—It is very important both to the United States and Florida, that those titles should be settled with all speed—The recording can be easily done when the Boards meet—so that wont delay them—I think it my duty to urge you to have a new board appointed, knowing how slow and tedious we get on, altho' it will shorten the period of my office.”—(Signed)
Nathaniel A Ware.—The underscoreing has been done by myself.—
I have also received an other Letter from Mr Joseph M. White, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, dated at Penzacola the
29" of Dec ulto.” in which, he invites my attention to the necessity of appointing a Recorder & translater of Spanish Claims, at S" Augustine at the present Session of Congress. He also adds, that the Commissioners after the session at Penzacola, will proceed immediately to S"Augustine, where, he says it will take at least six months to collect records & translate a sufficient number for to proceed to their adjudication.—Sir, it is now to late, to call the attention of Congress, as suggested by M. White. The establishment of a new Board is, in my estimation, the Course which aught to be adopted:
Whose Secretary, shall understand the Spanish language.—I may not be rong in allowing my self further elusidations on this important subject; & should I have over steped the bounds of proper limits, I
trust will easily be perceived & constitute an ample apology; for, they alone, lead me to appear before the Honorable Body over which you preside.—
The Spanish Government, kept East & West Florida under two separate & distinct governments, in which much difference have arisen from the system pursued by their respective Governors, as well as in the fortuitous occurrences, which from time to time, were experenced in both Provinces.—In the Judiciary they were govern"
alike, when the Laws of the Kingdome, prescribe the Course of the Tribunals for the administration of justice.—But very different as regards the jurisdiction of the rights of their respective governors.—
The power & priviledges which those Governors enjoyed, were also distinct & often very different, emanating either from their Sovereign, the Cap" General & Intendant of the Island of Cuba, or from the great discretionary powers which the Government of Spain always yielded to the governors of her ultra marine possessions.—So much
<pb#641 />
have those causes had their influence, that but few cases of either Province would be a just criterion for the other.—
Spain like every other nation had its own peculiar system of government, extending to one portion of her dominions priviledges which she refused to others; & some times, even contrary to the general policy of her government: She gave to Floridas; & I believe Louisiana, the priviledge of enjoying the Protestant Religion & allowed foregners, who would settle in those Provinces, the rights of her own subjects, from the moment the took the oath of fidelity, and this was only to defend the Province when invaded & to be subject to the Laws of the Realm.—
The Inhabitants were exempt from all system of taxation—not even for the support of the Church—They were allowed a free school for the education of their children, without distinction of person except in sex. They paid a Duty of Six p"Cent on foregn importations & exported the produce of the country free of duty.
All vacant Lands in the Spanish Colonys, were called the Kings patrimony, and as the great Lord of the National Domain, previous to the Adoption of the present Constitution of the Spanis Monarchy, he disposed of them at his will & as he judged most beneficial to the settlement of his Colonys, very often in reward of individual merit, but, I know of no instance in which he disposed of them, of his own accord, for a pecuniary consideration. His Vice Roys, Commanding
& Cap" Generals as well as his Governors, personated his Sovereignty, in their respective territorial jurisdictions; and some of them have had the confidence, in many instances, to make them selves His Magesty in person. endeed the people understood, that the acts of their Governors were guaranteed to them & that they alone were responsable to the King.— In East Florida about the Year 1792 a Royal proclamation was published,” inviting forigners to settle in that Province, making it obligatory in the Governors to grant them lands free, even from the expence of their survey. One Hundred acres were granted to the Heads of the family & fifty to every other person belonging to it. this quota was afterwards reduced by Governor White, about the year 1802” to fifty acres to the Heads of the family & twenty five acres to every other person thereof above the age of Sixteen. He also imposed, as conditions, that possession should be taken within six months after the grant was made, the right of which was forfited after two years abandonment, in the intermediate term of ten years possession, when any other person had the right to locate the same & retain it under the same conditions. In the year 1815 an other Royal Order was issued requiring of the Governors
7s Dated Nov. 29, 1789, proclaimed Nov. 20, 1790 (White, ed., New Colls. Laws, II, 276-277; A. S. P. Pub. Lands, v, 749).
74 Dated Oct. 12, 1803 (White, op.cit., pp. 277–278; A. S. P., op.cit., pp. 749–750).
<pb#642 />
to grant, as a special act of grace, to all those persons, who had defended that Province in the revolution of 1812, a quota of land, in fee simple, agreeably to their head rights"—The governors of that Province, also made grants of lands agreeably to the provisions of the Laws of Indias & for the incouragement of Saw Mills, tan yards, & cattle ranges. But with the exception of those grants made in complyance of the Royal order of 1815, the titles to most of the others depended on the performance of sertan conditions respectively stated in those grants.—It may happen that the Governors of West Florida may have had to adopt quite a different policy from that of the Governors of East Florida.—I have also to state that the Act of Congress, passed last session, to ascertain titles to lands in Florida, if allowed to remain in its present shape will jeopardise the rights of the United States to lands in that territory & expose the Inhabitants to great expence; in as much as it seems to allow the existance of British emigrant right to lands there. A Right not in existance under the Spanish government. The deraingment of titles required by that Act, when the Claimant is not the original owner, may put the Commissioners & the parties to great inconvenience & in many instances, may be utterly unattainable—the fees to the surveyors is to great, particularly as most of the proprietors have already paid for the survey of their lands—the fees allowed to the Secretary of the Board of Commissions for recording titles aught to be repeald: nor aught the Inhabitants to be put to any expence in the exhibition of their titles or proofs of property, where the title is a bonafide one—the quantity of land on which the Commissioners are authorized to decid by that Act, would not imbrace the Planters of that Territory; many of whom, have from 20 to upwards of One Hundred workers persons—
Shoud not an additional Board of Commissioners be appointed this Session of Congress. I can only add, that the settlement of East Florida will be retarded at least three years longer; & whether it would be right to deprive the Inhabitants of the use of their property,’till after the session of Congress for the year 1825, is an injury which I
hope the Senate will take into consideration I have the Honor to be With much respect Your Most Ob Serv"

<place-time>[Referred February 19, 1823]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Hon. the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Citizens of West Florida respectfully sheweth:
That at the last Session of the Legislative Council a Law was passed for raising a revenue in this Territory, the provisions of which subjected Lands to a Tax of twentyfive cents per hundred acres, town property to twelve and a half cents for every hundred Dollars, every free male person above twenty one years to One Dollar, and every slave above ten years to fifty cents, besides very heavy taxes on billiard tables, auctioneers, tavern licences, &c." Since the passage of the Law, however, the Contingent expences of the Council, and printing of its Acts, have been paid by the General Government with a munificence honorable in the highest degree to its magnanimous and liberal policy. Your Memorialists are so much the more penetrated with gratitude at this liberality, as the General Government, in the midst of its multifarious and important duties, could not be supposed
<pb#645 />
to have an intimate knowledge of their truly deplorable situation.
They therefore respectfully represent, that a resort to territorial taxation is totally unnecessary, and in the present wretched condition of this Territory, an infant and helpless member of the Union, without population, without roads to encourage that population, and bowed still lower to the dust from the fatal effects of a most malignant epidemy, is peculiarly burthensome and oppressive.
Your Memorialists would also respectfully submit that the claims to Lands and town property have not yet been, and are not likely soon to be, decided upon, so that the Claimants cannot find purchasers for almost the only means they have to look to for their support, and many of them so far from being able to pay this tax, have hardly a bare subsistence. In some cases the tax is greater than the Lands could be sold for, and in one or two it amounts to several thousand Dollars for pine barren lands. Slaves also so far from being a source of revenue to their owners, are in the present prostrate state of the Country, a mere incumbrance.
Your Memorialists therefore pray that the several provisions of the aforementioned Law be for the present dispensed with: They solicit this with the more confidence, as it is a fundamental principle of the Constitution of this free Country that there can be no taxation without representation.
Your Memorialists hope this favor from your known justice and liberality And they will, as in duty bound, ever pray &c.

<dochead>ACTING GOVERNOR WALTON TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR</dochead>
<source>[NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., W 240:LS]</source>
<place-time>PENSACOLA, February, 20* 1823.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR; Your letter, under date of 20* December last has been received.” It is very gratifying to find, that the measures adopted by me for the purpose of explaining to the Indians of Florida the causes which produced a failure of the treaty, and thereby preventing any unfriendly feelings towards the United States, have been considered judicious, and have met the approbation of your Department—
I regret to state to you, that Col. Humphreys returned to Pensacola in a few days subsequent to his leaving it for St. Marks. The causes you will find explained in his letter to me; a copy of which is herewith enclosed.—
I had, sometime since, the honor of addressing you in relation to my duties as Secretary of this Territory,” and respectfully solicited any suggestions which might have been dictated by your view of the subject. The engagements of your Department, which are no doubt, very pressing during the Session of Congress, have, I imagine, prevented you from complying heretofore with this request.—
In my former communication, an opinion was intimated, that the law by which the Government of Florida was organized, did not contemplate my performing the duties of Clerk to the Governor as ex officio superintendent of Indian Affairs. Further inquiry and reflection have contributed to strengthen and sustain the correctness of this position. By referring to the letter of the Secretary of War, bearing date 11"April, 1822.” addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and transmitting sundry statements in relation to the Indian Department, I find that the Governors of Territories are by law, ex officio superintendents of Indian Affairs,” and are allowed $1,500, as a compensation for Clerk hire, office rent, fuil, &c.—
<pb#647 />
From this statement of the War Department, it would clearly appear, that the functions of Governor were seperate and distinct from those which attached to him as Superintendent of Indian Affairs.—In the first case, a Secretary is provided, receiving his appointment from the President with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States; in the second, the Governor is authorized to employ Clerks for a special purpose. As Governor, a salary, fixed by law, is allowed for his services; as Superintendent, no Salary is provided, but a particular sum appropriated to cover the expences incident to hiring a Clerk, office rent, fuel, &c—Had the agency of the Secretary been required to perform these services, he would have been so designated; his salary, it is conceived, would have been rendered amply sufficient to meet them, and this provision for Clerk hire &c be entirely superfluous. Agreeably to my understanding of the law, its intention must, therefore have been, that as superintendent of Indian Affairs, the governor is authorized to employ a seperate Clerk, for which an adequate compensation is allowed, as also a sum sufficient to cover the disbursements for office rent, fuil &c.—
In the absence of the Governor from the Territory, when the duties of Superintendent devolves on the Secretary, it is with due deference submitted to your consideration, whether he should not be allowed the same compensation for his Services, and for the purpose of meeting similar expenditures. Thus situated, not only the ordinary services of Secretary were required to be rendered, but those in addition which belong to the Governor and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs.
With this trible labor and responsibility imposed upon me, it would have been altogether impracticable for me to have discharged my duty with fidelity, without the employment of a Clerk. To this burden I have been necessarily subjected ever since the Governor's departure from Florida for the State of Kentucky."—
As I am averse to prefering any account against the Government which is not perfectly just and equitable, I should be sincerely thankful to you for any suggestions which would assist in forming a definitive opinion upon this subject; Of this I am satisfied—that the services have been rendered; if I am entitled to any remuneration, I am equally convinced, that the Government, in the distribution of equal justice, will be disposed to make the proper allowance."—

<place-time>GEN. LAND OFFICE 27th Feby 1823.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Several of the Florida records of land titles are wanting, and unless they can be obtained, much litigation may arise. Some of the
<pb#653 />
records which we have, contain only indexes of title, but which of necessity must be relied on, as the best evidence that can be produced.
If practicable, all the Volumes that contain evidence of title in the territory, should be obtained. The Volumes which we have, I understand, were procured by the Hon. M King when he was minister in England, and this leads to a presumption, that the absent Volumes may be found in that country, if further search be made. Mr King can probably give some facts, which may assist the enquiry.
I submit the above to your consideration, and would respectfully suggest, whether it would not be proper to write to Mr Rush" on the subject.
I am very respectfully your obedient servant JOHN MOLEAN

<docbody>Florida Roads.
The road required to be opened from the River S." Mary's
(Colerain in Georgia) to the Cowford * on the river S" Johns about 42
The Same is open and in good order from the Crawford to S'
Augustine—about 40
distance from S' Mary's to S' Augustine 82
From S*Augustine to the Head of the river Mantanzes, it requires to be opened about 30
From The Head of the River Matanzes to Tomoca or the Mosquito, it is open and in good order 35
From Tomoca it requires to be opened to the old town of Old Smyrna, at Mosquito about 30
Distance from S*Mary's in a due South course— 177
<pb#654 />
This Road was originally opened by the British Government, at great expense, the principal causeways are nearly as good as hew ever, and it can be repaired with very little labor.
It is necessary the the forty two miles distance from the river S"
Mary's to the Crawford should be opened in order that the mail to S'
Augustine may be sent upon it as directed by the Act of Congress passed last session.—
The 30 Miles required to be opened from S*Augustine to join the Tomoca road at the head of the river Matanzas, is of importance &
will take but little labor to put in good order; after which, the 30 Miles required from the tomoca to the Town of New Smyrna will contribute much to promote the interest of that important part of the Territory, where the best sugar lands are:-
The direction which I have given to the road from S*Augustine to Pensacola, is the same which the acting Governor suggests in his letter to the Secretary of War, which will probably be sent to the Senate with the Bill passed in the House of Rep" authorizing the opening of those roads, and in which I hope the Senate will concur.

Augustine, to Pensacola, passing by Picolata, on the river St. John's, to head the river St. Marks, and terminating at the point of land lying between the waters of St. Rose's Channel, and Pensacola Bay: which roads shall be plainly and distinctly marked, and shall be of the width of [two]* rods.

The occasion seemed peculiarly favourable, as affording a full justification for abandoning Florida and now the temporary occupation of the Navy Agency, exclusive of the pecuniary consideration, would be desirable as presenting an ostensible valuable motive for resuming my residence in New York. If I should be so fortunate, as to obtain ultimately this office, your confidence will be amply justified, my prospects in life revolutionized and the public be gratified. I will not give questionable but the best security for my integrity and men disconnected with commerce—

<source>[NA:WD, CE Lets. Recd.:ALS]</source>
<place-time>WASHINGTON CITY 11th March 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR Agreeably to your request, I have herewith the Honor to return to you the estimate of the expense of opening a Road from S"
Augustine to Penzacola, by the labour of the troops of the United States, Stationed in Florida, and also the two Letters from the Acting Governor of that Territory, on that Subject. the same which you were pleased to transmit to me in Your Communication of the 22"
Ulto; * With a request that I should lay them before Congress, which I did accordingly.—
Knowing the interest you take, in the prosperity of the territory which I have had the Honor to represent, I avail myself of this occasion to call your attention to several Subjects vitally connected with it.—
I herewith enclose a Bill which passed the House of Rep" authorizing the opening of two roads; * both of which, are of the utmost importance to that territory. I also enclose a copy of a letter which I
adressed to Colonel Williams of the Senate,” relative to the roads mentioned in that Bill, In hopes that you may have it in your power to adopt some plan by which they may be opened during the recess of Congress, as the late hour in which that Bill was sent to the Senate prevented that Honorable Body from Acting upon it.—
<pb#663 />
There are now a Considerable number of troops in that territory, which, in the State of peace which we happily enjoy, Could probably not be better employed than in the opening of those Roads, which in the event of a war, cannot otherwise than prove very useful to the Nation.—The advantages which the territory will enjoy from them must be obvious to the Government, particularly, when it is considered, that its population is divided between S" Augustine and Penzacola; and that the nearest practicable route, by which they can at present communicate with each other, is, by land, upwards of seven Hundred Miles.—
The Course which I have pointed out for the road from S"Augustine to Penzacola, is the same which the acting Governor suggests in his communication to you of the 31* Jan’ last.” & which reduces the distance considerably from that on which the estimate of expense was founded, & will effect the same object.—
If the Government were to make a Donation of a Suitable tract of land, at Such place as Should be deemed the most eligible for the Seat of the territorial Government; Say, about the Suwanee, where the lands are represented as being fertile, high & healthy, the two Provinces, as under the Spanish Government, might be continued united, And soon become a respectable State in the union,-Whereby, it would be enabled to support the expences of its own Government.
Under the existing Circumstances of the two divisions of that territory, it is with great difficulty, that one portion of the Members of the Legislative Council can attend at their place of Meeting, which, must either be held at S" Augustine or Penzacola.—Were it not, Sir, for the high respect which the Inhabitants of that territory have for the President and the imperative dictates of public duty, I am confident that no person, competent to discharge the duties of that station would accept of such an appointment: The alternative being presented to them of performing a long and dangerous voyage of near 2000
Miles, or of travling by land, on horse back, upwards of 700 Miles, through an unsettled; And during the seson of rains, an almost impassable Country.
The Compensation allowed to the Members of that Legislative Council, for travling, is only three Doll" for every twenty Miles, which is scarcely adequate to defray their expences. These disadvantages will be obviated as soon as a Communication is opened through the territory; as the distance then will probably not exceed
380 Miles between the two Cities.—The Seat of Government Aught to be fixed as Near the Center as possible, in order that the population of the two Sections of the territory may be brought near each other, and mutual relations of interest and union be thereby established and strengthened.— **.
<pb#664 />
I will further beg leave to Call your attention to the condition of the Indians of that territory.—
Measures Should be adopted to Consentrate those Indians, as they are now dispersed throughout the whole territory. If Suita- and judicious Gentlemen, Known to enjoy their Confidence, were Selected to Assemble their Chiefs & other influencial Men of their tribes, to acquant them with the favourable disposition of the Government towards them, & to Make them Sensible of the indispensable necessity of their abandoning the Chase, & the propriety of resorting to to Agricultural pursuits; and who should be empowerd to allot them a Suitable place where they could plant to advantage and attend to the increase of Stock. I Make No doubt that this great object would be accomplished Much to their own interest and that of the Government.
Those Indians, for Many years, were the principal persons, who supplied S" Augustine with Cattle & Horses, untill the year 1812
when they were forced from their Settlements; And being thus broken up, have continued ever Since, without the least Kind of Spirit of industry or enterprize,—they could at one time have been Considerd, as having arrived at the first Stage Civilization, & with judicious Management, they can be restored to their former Condition &, become, as before, useful people.—But, I Nevertheless, entertain some fears that from the Notions which have lately been impressed on their minds, in regard to their being the ligitimate proprietors of Most of the lands West of the river S" Johns, May oppose an obsticle to bringing about this desired arrangement. However, Should the troops be employed in the opening of the Road from S" Augustine to Penzacola, they will come very much in aid of the endeavours of the Government to effect this object.—As the appointment of persons to treat with them is of vast importance, I would Suggest the propriety of Making the selection from those persons who are Known to possess their confidence. The Indian agent, being a Stranger to them, would not possess this advantage; And Acting alone, might find it difficult to make them believe, that he was not exclusively devoted to the interest of the United States.—
I would further beg leave to Solicit your attention to the subject of the Public property in the Cities of Penzacola & S"Augustine,—The Committee of the House of Rep" to whome was referred a Memorial from the City Council of S" Augustine, praying for a Donation of Certain public lots & Houses, for the Use of that City,” & a Resolution of Mine relative to similar property in the City of Penzacola,” from the Multiplicity of business before them, added to the shortness of the late Session of Congress, were prevented from making any report thereon. I have therefore, respectfully, to request you will com-
<pb#665 />
municate this circumstance to the President of the United States, in hopes that he may be pleased to direct, that such of said property as is not required for Revenue or Military purposes, may be retained in the possession of the Corporations of said Cities, till Congress make a disposition of it, —And to give directions to the Military Commandent to permit the use of dry and Wholesome appartments in Fort S" Marks in S*Augustine, for the Confinement of criminals & debtors, untill the resources of the territory will enable it to build a Jail. I Am the more induced to call your particular attention, And of the President, to the Subject of Public property, from having learned, that an unfortunate misunderstanding, has Subsisted between the Civil &
Military Authorities of that place, which is at all times much to be deprecated.—
I cannot conclude this Letter without assuring you that the former Subjects of Spain, residents of Florida, fully appretiate all the advantages, to be derived from their territory becoming an integral part of the United States; And a Knowledge of the Marked attention which Congress, during the present Session, And also the Exicutive, have been pleased to show to every Suggestion which which had for its object the promotion of their interest will further Unite them with their fellow Citizens in the bonds of Amity And Confraternity.”—

<place-time>BALTIMORE March 13th 1823</place-time>
<docbody>D* SIR I had the honour to receive last evening y' letter of the 10"
Ins" with its enclosure.”
Presuming from its phraseology that I am not requested to report thereon directly to the Secretary of State as I did on the 7" Jany last on the claim of M Antelme Gay,” I will endeavour to answer it as fully as I can, immediately to you—
Under the 14" Section of Gen' Jackson's 4" Ordinance I appointed George Murry Prosecuting Attorney for the County Court of St John's in East Florida—to attend the 1* Court thereof on the 1* Monday of September 1821 M Murry attended that Court, also another monthly court, to wit, on the first Monday in October—He was about the 10" of October taken ill with the yellow fever and on getting convalescent made a visit to Sullivan's Island near Charleston. no monthly court was held in November—the second Quarterly court coming on to wit, on the 1" monday in December & Mr Murry not returned I appointed M. John Rodman Prosecuting Attorney pro-tem.
by my letter of the 1* Dec 1821. He attended that court and the monthly courts of January & Feby 1822.—and the Quarterly court of March—He could not have attended any other courts in that capacity, as I abolished the monthly courts at March & the Judges before the next Quarterly court considered themselves functi officio, by the act of Congress, consolidating the two Floridas; altho' I considered them, ex necessitate, in being, till actually superceded—M Rodman thought SO too.—
Now Sir—the 14th Section of the 4th Ordinance aforesaid under which M. Murry and Mr Rodman were appointed prosecuting attornies says “who (that is the said attornies) shall receive in each case a reasonable compensation to be taxed by the court.”—It was their duty then, if they wished compensation to have applied to the court and had it taxed in each case—Further, the very last item in the 13"
<pb#667 />
Section of the 5* Ordinance says—“The Prosecuting Attorney for every conviction shall receive $5.00—This certainly is higher than the criminal fees in this state & I suspect as high as those in any of the states—During the time of M* Murry;” the U States D* Attorney Mr Bird was there—when Judge Du Val got to S*Augustine, about the 20" of Nov" he appointed Mr. Greenbury Gaither District Attorney, held one Court & went off to Washington-I presume Mr Gaither considered himself District Attorney till Mr Alex Hamilton arrived, say, till the 15. of May, when Mr Rodman states, he delivered over the papers to Mr Hamilton—
Now, it appears to me, that the claim of Mr Rodman, stands nearly on the same ground as that of the whole Posse of Officers appointed under General Jacksons Ordinances who may have neglected or been unable to secure their fees or considered them inadequate to their services—He was residing there as Collector of the Customs of the U: States—He was also a practising Counsellor & Attorney at Law, got a good deal of business & it is supposed his Attorneyship was of no great inconvenience to him—
Yet, I state on his behalf, with great satisfaction, that I found him an honest, intelligent & faithful prosecuting Attorney and at all times ready & willing to do his duty whenever & however called upon:
And as our Judicial System was new to the people there, I dare say he had considerable trouble: But during my stay there the Criminal Docket was small & not very important; but one trial for Homicide—
For the number of days & the particular items of Mr Rodmans charge I have no data whatever,-
I should think, unless his claim be admitted on his own voucher, which I suppose can only be done under the rule of the Accounting officers of the Treasury, if such a rule exist, that he might be allowed from the 1* of December 1821 to the 15. of May 1822 at the rate of $200–
per Annum, the salary fixed for the District Attorney; this, as additional compensation to his legal fees & perquisites—
Mr Rodmans papers are returned—With friendship & respect &"

<docbody>SIR—I do myself the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16" of Jan: * enclosing a commission for William Sebree
<pb#668 />
as Marshall of the part of the Territory of Florida known as West Florida: * as soon as he shall arrive the commission shall be delivered to him on the execution of his bond.
Last autum during the fatal pestilence which prevailed here I
received a letter from M Sullivan of the department of State accompanying the volumes of the laws of the U. S. the secret journals of Congress ordered to be printed, the state papers, and the census of
1820: living at the time in the country I sent a letter to the Post Office addressed to M.” Sullivan, by a man in my employment, but who was attacked by the yellow fever and died a few days after his return home, and I never knew until lately that the letter had not been put in the Post Office. Subsequent to that time I have received the 7" Vol. of Wheatons report, and a supplement to the census.
There is a subject of great importance to the Goverment on which I intended to address a particular communication. The quantity and quality of the live oak and cedar, in the vicinity of the Sea from this place to Appalachicola I am well convinced is very greatly underrated. Among the papers of a M. Saltenstall upon whose estate I
administered I found an answer to a letter addressed by him to an eminent ship builder accompanyed with drawings of the different pieces used in the construction of ships, from which it would appear that a scheme had been formed to cut this valuable timber on speculation. The information enabled me to form a more correct estimate of the value of the timber, which is very great. Persons are now engaged in cutting cedar, and it is not unlikely that unless measures are taken they will commence upon the live oak. The proximity of the cedar to ship navigation is a most important consideration.
There is no agent of the United States here, to whom I could give this information.”
I am with great respect Your most obed S'

<place-time>TREASURY DEPARTMENT Fifth Auditor’s Office March 18th 1823.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Congress having at their last Session passed an Act authorizing the erection of a Light House at or near the entrance of the Harbour of Pensacola and appropriated six thousand dollars therefor,” I have to request your aid in affecting the necessary arrangements preparatory to inviting proposals for a contract.
You will cause an exaination to be made and the most suitable scite fixed on, designating by proper metes and bounds as much ground as may be necessary for the accommodation of the establishment (say two or three acres as a Garden spot for the Keeper. The great consideration in fixing on the scite is the visibility of the Light House, which will depend on its projection toward the sea and elevation above the surface of the Water, but the firmness of the ground and freedom from Quick sands are also matters of consequence.
Great care must therefore be used in making the examination and reporting evey particular of the nature of the elevation, accessability of the place, and generally the local advantages and dissadvantages of the situation, if the ground is private property measures must be taken for ascertaining the price, unless the proprietor from a desire to promote such important improvements, should be induced to give it gratis.
The foregoing information being obtained it will be proper, in forming the plan of the building and deciding on the materials of which it ought to be built to have it understood what elevation the Light should have so that no expence sheuld may be incurred in raising it immediately unnecessarily.
As soon as you are in possession of the necessary information, be pleased to communicate it immediately with your opinion of the plan
&c, which may be deemed most advantageous.”

<place-time>DEPMT OF WAR, 19 March 1823</place-time>
<docbody>HON: J M HERNANDEZ City of Washington SIR I have considered your letter of the 11th instant relative to opening certain roads in Florida;” and have given orders to the commanding Officer at S*Augustine, for opening the road between that Gales & Seaton, Jan. 8, 1824, id. to Henry Dearborn, Jan. 10, Feb. 3, Apr. 2, 1824, id. to Winslow Lewis, Apr. 2, May 1, May 17, 1824, id. to Archibald W. Hamilton, May 1, 1824 (NA,TD, Lighthouse Letters, Bk. 6); Scott to Pleasonton, Apr. 1, 1824, Dearborn to Pleasonton, Apr. 14, 1824, Hamilton to Pleasonton, May 25, June 14, 1824, J. W. Lewis to Pleasonton, May 10, 1824 (NA,TD, Lighthouse Supt. Letters). A number of proposals for constructing the lighthouse dated early in 1824 are to be found in NA(TD, Bids, Contracts and Proposals). The successful bidder was Winslow Lewis, of Boston, Mass., with whom a contract was made on Apr. 13, 1824, which is recorded in NA(TD, Lighthouse Deeds and Contracts, Bk. D).
Steps were taken during 1823 to reconstruct an old Spanish lookout house on St. Anastasia Island at St. Augustine for use as a lighthouse. Correspondence relative thereto includes the following: Pleasonton to John Rodman, Mar. 13, Apr. 25, 1823, Jan. 22, Mar. 11, May 1, 1824, Pleasonton to the Secretary of the Treasury, Mar. 11, 1824, id. to Winslow Lewis, Nov. 10, 1823, id. to the President, Mar. 12, 1824 (NA, TD, Lighthouse Letters, Bk. 6); Rodman to Pleasonton, Apr.
5, Apr. 7, 1823 (NA, TD, Lighthouse Clippings); id. to id., July 7, Aug. 12, 1823, Jan. 6, Feb. 23, Mar. 16, Mar. 30, Apr. 5, May 18, 1824 (NA, TD, Lighthouse Supt. Lets.). The contract for the lighthouse was made with Elias Wallen, of St.
Augustine, Aug. 9, 1823 (NA,TD, Lighthouse Deeds and Contracts, Bk. D).
Applications for the appointment as keeper were received from John Andreu, a pilot and resident of St. Augustine, to the President, Feb. 23, 1824; William Brown, of the same place, who had served as keeper of the Spanish signal tower there, to the President, Apr. 13, June 17, 1824 (postmarked); and Henry Ayers, a sergeant in the 4th Artillery, Feb. 22, 1824, who was recommended in a letter from R.
Weightman to John Rodman, June 23, 1823, and an unaddressed letter from Edgar Macon, Feb. 23, 1824 (NA, TD, Lighthouse Keepers' Applications). Pleasonton informed Rodman, Mar. 16, 1824 of the appointment of Andreu, (NA, TD, Lighthouse Letters, Bk. 6).
Pursuant to an act of Congress approved May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 61), preparations were initiated during the first half of 1824 for the construction of lighthouses at Sambo keys, Careysfort Reef, Dry Tortugas, and Cape Florida. Relevant correspondence includes the following: Pleasonton to the Secretary of the Treasury, Apr. 5, 1824, id. to Morgan Davis, May 3, 1824, id. to Gales and Seaton, June 5, 1824, id. to Henry Dearborn, June 14, 1824, (NA, TD, Lighthouse Letters, Bk. 6). Proposals dated June 24, 1824 from Reuben Loring and Elias Wallen, both of St. Augustine, are in NA(TD, Bids, Contracts and Proposals). Morgan Davis applied to the Secretary of the Treasury, May 21, 1824 for the appointment as keeper at Cape Florida (NA, TD, Early Lighthouse Corres.), and to Pleasonton, June 13, 1824 (NA, TD, Lighthouse Keepers' Applications). John Rodman recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury, June 25, 1824, the appointment of John Whalton at Careysfort Reef (loc. cit.). See post, XXIII, July

when, if it can be done with propriety, the necessary orders will be given.
It is intended to have the country between S*Augustin and Pensacola explored this Summer, if it can be done conveniently, and a plan of the route and estimate of the expense made out, which may enable you I hope to get the consent of Congress at the next Session for opening a road between these places."
In relation to the Indians, Commissioners will be immediately appointed * with directions to concentrate them on the Country South of Charlotte Harbor, if there be a sufficient quantity of good lands in that part of the Peninsular; if not, to take in a part of the Country between that and Tampa Bay. They will be instructed to hold a treaty as early as practicable.”

GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of 27* January * & 10" February last *—they arrived a few days previous to my return from Baton Rouge.—
The State of my health will not allow of my surveying a road, at present, from this place to the Barrancas, but from a previous knowledge of the ground over which it ought to pass, and from information received from Officers since my receipt of your order, I believe I can make as correct a report & estimate as if I had actually surveyed it.
There are now two routes which are used; the first along the Beach, crossing the two Bayous, which intervene between this & the Barrancas, at their mouths; these Bayous however can only be crossed on horseback when the tide is low and even then are dangerous—the distance is about seven miles. The other is a waggon road, fifteen miles around, and heads the “Big Bayou;” it requires a bridge to be built over the “Little Bayou.”-
The new road proposed can be opened nearly in a direct line to the Barrancas, say in eight miles distance, at no expense excepting the per diem to the soldiers employed on it. The road itself will require but a few days labor to cut it out, as it will pass wholly through level Pine Barren; but there will be a Bridge to construct at each of the Two Bayous, & these bridges will consume most of the time & expense.
I estimate the entire expense of opening this Road at at $250.—
My health has improved considerably within a few weeks & unless some unfavorable change takes place I do not contemplate leaving Pensacola, even if my application for a furlough is granted; it will be however a considerable time, in any case, before I shall be able to relieve Capt. Thornton entirely in the duties of Quarter Master."—

<docbody>COLONEL GEORGE WALTON SecY & act” Gov" of Florida Pensacola.
SIR, Your letters of the 9” & 31st January & 20" of February were duly received;" but owing to the great press of business in the Department they have unavoidably remained unanswered untill this time.
A bill which you have drawn on this Department for $480 88/100
to enable you to pay Richards the Interpreter, and other Small expenses in the Indian Department will be paid when presented.
I am happy to learn that Col° Humphries the Indian Agent has at length arrived, and entered on his duties.” The instructions which you have given him, for his government are judicious and are approved by this Department.”
I have allowed the account of Major Wright, and the amount will be passed to your Credit on the Books of the 2nd Auditor.
The estimate for the Road between Pensacola and S*Augustine was immediately on its receipt transmitted to M.” Hernandez in order that he might take the necessary steps to procure an appropriation of the amount by Congress; and a bill for the purpose was passed by the House of Representatives, and sent to the Senate; but owing to the late period of the Session at which the subject was taken up, it was not finally acted upon.
In relation to compensation for your Services as acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs, in the absence of the Governor, I have to State that the law affixes no compensation for the services required of the territorial Governors as Superintendents of Indian Affairs of which you appear to be aware; but it has been usual to allow the expenses which they may incur in the performance of such duty, for clerk hire, office Rent &" upon an account rendered for the same, certified by the Governor, in cases where no specific allowance for that purpose has been made. This rule is considered equally applicable to the Secretaries of the Territories, while acting as Superintendents of
<pb#675 />
Indian Affairs in the absence of the Governors; and if you will render an account for your expenses, for Clerk, Office rent &" certified by yourself, it will, if deemed reasonable, be allowed.
I have examined the estimate which you forwarded, and it would gratify me to admit it for the whole amount, as I have no doubt a due regard has been had to economy in making it out; but the very limited appropriation for the Indian Department renders it necessary to confine the expenses to as small an amount as possible, without absolute injury to the public interest; and I am therefore constrained to restrict the expenses of the Indian Department in Florida, for the present year, to the Sum of $3,500—to wit—
Pay of Indian Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1500,00
Pay of Sub Agent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500,00
Presents to Indians . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500,00
Contingences, which includes all other Expenses . . 1000,00
$3,500,00
A remittance of half this sum is now made to you for the expenses of the two first quarters of the year; and I have no doubt every care will be taken to make it adequate to the object.
The balance will be remitted whenever the Governor or yourself may desire it.”

<docbody>COLONEL JAMES GADSDEN & BENARD SEGUI, esq Commissioners &c &c GENTLEMEN, I have the honor to enclose you a Commission from the President of the United States, appointing you Commissioners to hold a Treaty with the Florida Indians.”
The object to be accomplished by the proposed treaty, is the concentration of all the Florida Indians at some suitable point within that Territory, and the Country South of Charlotte Harbor and the River of that name which empties into it, has been designated for the
<pb#680 />
purpose. Your efforts will therefore be directed to the attainment of this object. Should there not be a sufficiency of good lands for the accommodation of the Indians in that part of the Peninsular designated, you are authorised to fix the boundary north of Charlotte Harbor and River, so as to take in as much of the Country between them and Tampa Bay, as in your judgment may be necessary to give the Indians enough of good lands, and sufficient space considering their habits of life, leaving the conditions to your sound discretion. As it is desirable that the Treaty should be held as soon as practicable, you will as early as convenient make your arrangements for that purpose. Confiding in your prudence that the treaty will be held with the least possible expense, it is deemed unnecessary to give you any particular instructions on that point. The principal article of expense will probably be the issue of provisions to the Indians while treating with them. To avoid the delay which a correspondence between the Commissioners for the purpose would occasion M"
Segui, being most convenient to the Indians will fix on the time and place of holding the treaty after consulting M" Hernandez the Delegate from the Territory, and notify Col: Gadsden the other Commissioner, thereof. Mr Segui will also ascertain the quantity of provisions that will probably be required, and issue his requisitions for the Same on the Commissary of Subsistence at S* Marks if the treaty should be held at that place or Contiguous to it, or on the Commissary at S*Augustine if it should be held there or near it who will be ordered to obey such requisitions, and charge the amount to the Indian Department. The enclosed circular will be complied with in issuing the provisions, to which, as there has in some instances been great irregularity, I particularly call your attention.
The Indian Agent Col: Gad Humphries who is stationed for the present, at S*Marks is instructed to obey your orders on all points connected with the proposed treaty, and to prepare the Indians to meet the Commissioners at the time & place which may be fixed upon for holding it.”
For the funds which you may find necessary to defray the expenses attending the negociation, you will draw on this Department.
Your compensation will be at the rate of $8 and that of the Secretary to the Commission, (whom you are authorised to appoint) at the rate of $5—per diem, for the time actually engaged. The payment will be made on your Certificate of honor, specifying the time that you and the Secretary have been actually engaged. Your certificate in like manner will be a necessary voucher for the presents, should there be any, distributed under your authority.”
<pb#681 />
The treaty when made will be forwarded to this Department.”

<place-time>PENSACOLA April 10" 1823–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Herewith enclosed you will receive a statement of my account with the United States.” You will observe that I am debited with the receipt of $5000. and have credited myself with the several items of expenditure in numerical order. There are several of these last which require some explanation to be clearly and distinctly understood—
The accounts of Messrs Mitchell & Brownejohn for copying the acts of the Legislative Council are cases of this description. These two gentlemen were employed in the first instance to perform this labour in order that the printer might be furnished with a copy in pursuance of an Act of the Legislative Council. When completed it was considered expedient by the Governor that it should be forwarded as speedily as practicable to St. Augustine. The adoption of this step created the necessity of having an additional copy executed to secure the object for which it was originally intended. This will satisfactorily explain to you the second account of M. Brownejohn, who performed the task in conformity to the directions of Governor Duval.
The sum of $300 paid Col. de la Rua, for the rent of a building appropriated to the purposes of a Court house, was in my estimation sanctioned by justice & propriety. It had been rented by the Clerk of the County Court during the administration of Gen' Jackson, and devoted to the use of the public for twelve months; under such circumstances I had no hesitation in believing the account a just one and liquidated it accordingly—Upon submitting it to the Governor it appeared to meet his decided approbation as I hope it will that of your Department—
Relative to the expenditure for printing the acts of the Legislative Council you will observe that there has been paid the sum of
$1238.12%. This account has been settled in conformity with estimates prepared by the printers of Mobile & New Orleans which was to be adopted as the rule of settlement in the original contract. These
<pb#684 />
estimates were not presented in a shape to be satisfactory and the printer insists that they are 33% per cent below the regular prices charged in the offices at the Eastward and greatly below those which have heretofore been established in Mobile & New Orleans. He proposes obtaining estimates more in detail than those received & if it can be satisfactorily ascertained that the latter were too low I have given assurances that the balance shall be promptly discharged. I
felt myself authorised to give this pledge from a confident belief, that it was not desirable to any department of the government to obtain individual services without making adequate compensation The bill of $91, for printing the ordinances &c of Gov" Jackson, although presented at this late period I have no doubt is perfectly just and should have been paid. I am myself conusant of the printing having been done by Nicholas & Tunstall in obedience to an order of Gov. Jackson and I have the positive declaration of Maj. Nicholas that the account has been inadvertently overlooked in former settlements. In this statement I have no hesitation in reposing the utmost confidence, and flatter myself that the appropriation to meet this account will meet your approbation—
Upon the item embracing the rent for an office, I have to remark, that it has always been kept in the house occupied by my family.
During the months of July, August & September rents continued very high, and all the publick buildings were in the occupation of the officers and soldiers of the U. States Army, In consequence of the prevalence of disease in Pensacola my office was removed to & remained in the Country during the months of October & November.
For this latter period no expense was incurred; from the first of December until this time I have been under the necessity of renting the same house for the above purpose but upon much more moderate terms. Upon my return to this place I found that the Government house which had been delivered over to the civil authority was in such a state of dilapidation as to be unfit either for an office or residence for my family; and there was unfortunately no other building surrendered that could be appropriated to those purposes. In this condition of affairs I had no discretion. The Government house was turned over to the different courts of Justice where they have since held their sessions and this was the only useful manner in which it could possibly be employed ”
With sentiments of the highest consideration I have the honor to be Yr. Mo. obed" serv"

The officers of the First Brigade of Florida, are required without delay to take the oath prescribed by law; and enter on the duties of their respective offices. The field and platoon officers will proceed to organize their respective regiments, battalions, and companies, and designate their several boundaries. The field officers will appoint the time and place for the muster and inspection of their regiments and battalions—they will cause the returns of strength, arms, and equipage, required by the act of the Territorial Council to be promptly furnished the Inspector of the Brigade, who is required to report accordingly to the office of the Adjutant General. Strict attention will be paid to the discipline and equipage of the Brigade—and the commanding general flatters himself, that every officer and soldier will be emulous to introduce and promote that order and subordinanation, so essential to their respectability in peace, and their efficiency in war. He relies with confidence on the zeal and patriotism of the Brigade, and feels well assured that its improvement in discipline will realize his highest expectations.”

<docbody>SIR; In the course of a few days, I shall set out on my journey to St.
Augustine, where the next Legislative Council is to be convened. I
had intended to travil in company with Governor Duval, who left this about two weeks since for East Florida; but have been unavoidably detained by my own illness and that of my family. At present, we are all upon the recovery; and I am in hopes to be enabled to take my departure from Pensacola on Saturday next *—
The serious inconvenience and expence to which I am exposed, in consequence of the seat of Government for this Territory not being permanently located, will be readily suggested upon the least reflection. I am compelled to be some time seperated, at a considerable distance from my family, and to meet disbursements which will almost absorb the whole of my salary. It is very desirable that these difficulties should be obviated as speedily as practicable, and relieve me, as
<pb#686 />
well as others from the embarrassments which they have created.
Were the seat of Government permanently fixed, either in East or West Florida, or at a central position, equally convenient to both sections of Territory, it would be perfectly immaterial, so far as my individual interests are involved; but until this is accomplished, I
cannot remove my family from Pensacola, with any confident assurances that they will remain for more than one year in a different portion of Florida.—
The 3" section of the “Act for the establishment of a Territorial Government in Florida,” makes it the duty of the secretary to transmit authentic copies of the proceedings of the Governor in his Executive capacity, every six months, to the President of the United States.”
Except in those cases where civil and military appointments have been made within the Territory, all the acts of the Governor in his Executive character, have consisted of communications forwarded by himself to the Department of State. The proceedings in both cases have been recorded as prescribed by the act; but it never suggested itself to me, that it was necessary in either, to transmit copies to the President of the United States. If in this, I have omited to observe any thing enjoined by the law, it would be gratifying to me to be advised of the fact, as I am solicitous to discharge with exactness and fidelity, the duties imposed by my appointment. Any information which you would be so good as to impart upon this subject, would be gratefully received.—
I have the honor to be, With sentiments of the highest consideration Yr. MO. Obt. Ser"—

<docbody>SIR, The Hon' J. L. Smith, Judge of the Superior Court for East Florida, has directed that all process issuing from that Court in the name and by authority of the Territory, shall be directed to, and served by the Sheriffs of the Counties of St Johns and Duval, as the case may be; those two counties composing the District over which his court has jurisdiction—
As this decision deprives me as Marshal of the principal part of my duties and emoluments, and places me in rather an embarrassing situation as to the few duties left me to perform; there being by this ar-
<pb#687 />
rangement, attached to the same Court, three distinct executive officers; I take the liberty Sir, of applying to you for instructions on the following points.
First Is the whole of the contingent expences of the Court; such as preparing a room, books and stationary for the Court & clerk, to be included in the Marshals account—
Second Is the expence of keeping and maintaining prisoners in the custody of the Sheriffs of S" Johns and Duval Counties, to be included in the Marshals account-
The Gentlemen of the Bar here, are decidedly of opinion, that the Marshal is the only executive Officer legally authorised to act in the Superior Court, organized under the authority of the United States—
With much respect I beg leave to enquire if it comes within your province to give directions as to the duties which I have to perform as Marshal: If it does not; whether the case can with propriety be referred to the Attorney General of the United States.

<docbody>SIR, Colonel Forbes, Edmund Law & myself were the commissioners regularly appointed by Act” Gov" Worthington in 1821 at S*
Augustine for taking possession of the Spanish archives and documents appertaining to the Territory of Florida, which had been retained by the Spanish Authorities at the time of Cession.”
The duties assigned us under that commission was duly & I believe Satisfactorially performed: The investigation of a great mass of papers was laborious & tedious, at a time too, when we were surrounded by the ravages of the yellow fever, which carried off one of the Clerks
(Mr Bird) during the examination.
<pb#688 />
It was not until sometime in the month of Oct or Nov 1822 that we made our joint account against the United States for these services;
this was transmitted with a power of Att to John Law Esq at Washington to present for payment & to receive the amount from the Government on our account.
Soon after, we were informed of the lamented death of John Law.
His brother proceeded to Washington, by him Colonel F. & myself entrusted our accounts with a power of Atty, as before to John Law.
Since then I have not heard from M. Edmund Law, or, the fate of my charge against the Government for these services so faithfully rendered.
I have understood, that the Colonel was at Washington last winter and that he probably received for himself the amount charged for his services on the occasion in question. William Reynolds Esq another of the Secretaries to the Commission informs me, that his charge for services in examining the documents has been allowed and paid.
The object of this communication is, to inquire if the charge made by me with the other commissioners Mess” Forbes & Law, has been allowed and paid on either of the powers of Att to John & Edmund Law—If not, are there any objections to the claim, if so, what are they? Indeed, any information you will please to communicate that will exhibit the state of the claim & the prospect of its being allowed in my case, who was President of the commission. If informed, your advice on the subject, & how I should state it correctly, I have rendered in this case, as well as in others, important services to the United States while in Florida, and I have suffered persecution—
But I trust I shall be paid as others have been for services rendered in that country & that too without cause of complaint.
The letters of Gov" Worthington on the subject of seizing the Archives & documents is in evidence of the approbation of my conduct—and if the approbation of Gen' Jackson also was necessary, that can be obtained—In the hope of hearing from you soon addressed to me at this place”

<docbody>SIR, It has been represented to the Department that timber of great value has been taken from the public lands, and that the practice increases rather than diminishes.
There is no law which makes it the duty of collectors of the Customs, to restrain this practice. The army And navy appear to be the instruments placed at the disposition of the President for the preservation of the public timber.
It is however Considered proper that every civil officer should contribute to the execution of the law Enacted for that purpose as far as the correct discharge of his appropriate duties will permit. I therefore request that you will not permit any vessel to clear out of your district, laden in whole or in part with live oak or red cedar, without making such inquiries as may be practicable to ascertain whether such timber has been cut from the public lands. If the information should not be Satisfactory, it will be your duty to notify the commanding military or naval officer of the district, of the facts, and leave him to act upon the case according to the instructions which he may have received.”

<docbody>SIR; I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Circular of the 18* March,” with the enclosed copies of an “act concerning the disbursements of public money.” ” It has been communicated to the Indian Agent, for his information and direction, with instructions, that its provisions will be strictly enforced.—
Inclosed, you will receive a copy of a letter from Colo. Humphreys, Indian Agent, which he addressed to me just upon my departure for St. Augustine, accompanying a talk he delivered to the Headmen and warriors of the Seminole Indians, and the reply of Eneamathla, their principal chief; copies of which are also forwarded.-
You will find from the talk of Eneamathla, that the Indians feel much solicitude about their future location. He is, however, believed to be incorrect in stating, that General Jackson told them in a talk, they should keep the lands they now live on at Tallahassee and other places, excepting that near the seaboard. In the talk delivered at Pensacola, no such pledge is to be found; but a declaration substantially to this effect; that they should remain on the lands they occupied, or be removed or concentrated at some convenient point within the interior. It is also evident from this reply, that although the Indians are disposed to cultivate the habits of white men; yet they are not willing that they should settle near them, or be crowded upon their towns and villages. They are desirous of continuing a separate and distinct people; and to effect this, they ought to be removed, so that they may be embodied upon the same tract of country. This should certainly be far removed from the seaboard, and sufficiently high up in the interior, so as not to break the continuity of white settlements which are to connect and consolidate East and West Florida.—
From Colo. Humphrey's communication to me, it appears, that it has become necessary he should remain here, to attend to the prosecution of Maturin Simon, for a violation of the “act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the
<pb#691 />
frontiers.” After this business is disposed of, he is direeted instrueted required to repair to St. Marks, where he was directed to reside in my former instructions.—
In relation to the Interpreter, Stephen Richards, against whom Colo. Humphreys has been partially engaged in investigating charges, I have to remark, that from the information which I have been enabled to collect, his conduct has been much misrepresented. I have, however, instructed Colo. Humphreys to prosecute the enquiry until he arrives at a satisfactory result, and if he finds him unworthy of the appointment to dismiss him."—
A draft on the Branch Bank of the United States, at New Orleans, for one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars, has just been transmitted to me by the Treasury Department, which I have been compelled to forward to that place to be negociated. As soon as the money arrives in this plaee, Pensacola, I have directed the following sums to be paid over to Colo. Humphreys, and his receipt taken for the same, in order to cover the expences of the Indian Department of Florida, for the first quarter of the present year: *
For pay to the Indian agent, . . . . . . . . . . $375:—
“ presents to the Indians, . . . . . . . . . . “125:–
“. Contingenies of Indian Department, . . . . “250:
Total, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $7[MS. torn]
I have understood, that Colo. Humphreys has already drawn for his first quarter's salary, and should it be paid it be paid at Washington, I have given instructions, that the sum depositted in the hands of my agent for the same purpose, shall be withheld, until that of the second quarter shall become due.
I have enclosed you a copy of the additional Instructions addressed to Colo. Humphreys," which, it is to be hoped, will meet your approbation.”—

SIR; I have the honor to give you the following statement of my proceedings in a visit to the Seminole Indians, in the neighbourhood of St Marks. I regret that a want of time previous to your departure, for St. Augustine, does not allow me to be as full and explicit in my narative as I could wish; A more minute detail shall be reserved for a future communication. The enclosed is the substance of a talk given at a meeting of the Indians at St. Marks on the 20" Ultimo;
and the accompanying replication, by Enehe Mothla, the head Chief, who speaks the sentiments of his Nation,”—as far as I can understand, will afford you the most correct view of my opperations, and and at the same time exhibit the feelings of the people with whom I have had to communicate.
I must not omit at this time, to state as a fact of apparent interist which may have influence on the measures hereafter to be adopted in relation to these people, that keeping in mind your Instructions of the 21* January, I made it a consideration of primary importance to ascertain the disposition and views of the Indians in relation to the cultivation of the Soil, and the adoption of the habits of civilized life, and I am happy to be enabled to say, that my inquiries have resulted in a seemingly well founded belief, that very little more is necessary to bring them into the measure, than to furnish them with the proper Implements of Husbandry, and locate them upon a tract of Land sufficiently fertile to reward and encourage their labours. Although the settled practice of hunting for a living appears appears almost inseparable from their nature, yet the sensible and reflecting among them begin, even at this period, to look upon it as a precarious and uncertain means of subsistence, and urge with reasonable but unyielding pertinacity, the necessity of providing ef previding other and more stable sources of support. They declared themselves satisfied with what they heard at the Talk, and said that notwithstanding they felt
<pb#693 />
great solicitue to know their destiny, yet they were resolved to wait patiently the the determination and orders of the Government on the subject, in the belief that strict justice would be done them.
They appear in general well disposed, and not inclined to be troublesome; yet there is a manifest impatience felt to be informed of the Intentions of the United States towards them, which they cannot disguise if they would; they assert with much plausibility, that the incertitude of their condition, precludes the possibility of their making those permanent arrangements so essential to their comfort and well being. How long their present docility of temper may continue it is impossible to say, and I beg leave to take the present occasion to suggest that the sooner they are attended to, and provided for the better.—
On the subject of the complaints against inst Yellow Hair, second Chief of the Chockenickla Town, mentioned in your letter of the
28* February,” I have to report, that the charges do not, on inquiry appear to be true to the extent at first represented. He is not, however, I apprehend, altogether free from impropriety of conduct; The other Chiefs have promised to investigate the matter, and deal with him according to their own laws, as they may think he deserves.—
The white Inhabitants of the Country, speake well of the deportment of the Indians generally, as being peacible and innoffensive.—
In relation to the allegations against the Interpreter, Mr Richards, which your last communication required me to investigate, I must remark, that the examination I have been able to make. (not altogether a satisfactory one) induces the conclusion, that although he is not so far culpable as was supposed, yet a portion of his conduct, since his appointment is in a high degree reprehensible. Notwithstanding this however, I have deemed it inexpedient for the present to remove him, as I find it utterly impossible to supply his place by any efficient or competent substitute; I shall therefore continue him until further instructions on the subject are received.
I have been under the necessity of seizing, on the Apalachicola River, a vessel and cargo of Maturin Simon, of this City, for a violation of the act of Congress of the 6* May 1822, in anmendment to an act entitled “An Act to regulate trade & intercourse with the Indian Tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers,” passed 30"
March, 1802—also for breach of his Licence, he having contrary to the terms of said Licence, and in direct violation of the Law aforesaid, not only carried Spirituous Liquors into the Indian Country but sold and issued the same to the Indians, at Blunt's Town, and other places, to the very great Detriment of the Public Good. Information has been lodged, the property Libelled, and the matter put into the hands of the District Attorney, Major Steele from whom, I under-
<pb#694 />
stand the cause will be tried in all probability, at the next May Term of the Superior Court of this District.—The District Attorney has notified me, that my presence at the trial will be essentially requisite;
if an arrangement for that purpose will not be seriously incompatible with my other official duties. He thinks it desirable for the success of the prosecution.—
My accounts for expenditures on the tour will be ready in a day or two and shall be forwarded either to yourself or Gov" Duval.”—

<docbody>SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of my Commission, as Marshal of West Florida; * having arrived here, on the 15th.
ultimo and entered upon the duties of that appointment.
Permit me to suggest, that great injury may result to the United States, from the circumstance of there being no jail in Pensacola:
(Escambia County;) nor indeed in all the Territory of West Florida–
The safe keeping of prisoners, therefore, Committed under the laws and Authorities of the United States, may become a very precarious matter; even with every caution, and vigilancane, on the part of the ministerial Officers.
The public jail, (or “Calabozo,”) in use here under the Spanish Government, is in a State of rapid decay: It cannot be used as a jail:
neither will it admit of improvement—
There is another subject to which I beg leave to call your attention.
The District of West Florida, is without a Court House, or any other Building suitable for the offices of the Court—
<pb#697 />
The House occupied at present as a Court Room, is an old public Building, very much out of repair: not even comfortable; nor yet is it convenient—It is not susceptible of any permanent improvement.
Upon these Subjects of interest to the government and to the people of this District, I shall feel much obliged to learn the pleasure of the Department—
Would it be convenient to forward me the laws of the United States?"—
With Sentiments of the highest Respect, I have the honour Sir, To be your most obt. Sevt.

<docbody>DEAR SIR. On my arrival in Charleston I received intelligence, of your flattering attention, in appointing me one of the Commissioners, to adjust claims to lands in East Florida," and as I presumed, it might be your intention to bestow the office of District Attorney on another, I immediately wrote to the Secretary of State," advising the propriety of suspending the appointment," until the termination of the present setting of the Superior Court, which would in all probability take place about the middle of June, at which time, the Legislative Council would also adjoun, in order to prevent any delay and consequent complaint in criminal prosecutions. The Superior Court has this day commenced its first session, under the direction of Judge Smith, to the very great satisfaction of the community, and it is with pleasure I inform you that the Judge is considered a valuable acquisition to the Territory—
The Legislative Council have not been able to form a quorum, it has nevertheless been determined to form temporary committees, in order to prepare for its legal session—In pursuing this course, no time will be lost and as it will be thus, only a business body, thier future legislation will in all probability be unexceptionable. The Governor

made his appearance three days since and will certainly be supported by the most respectable of the inhabitants, if he endeavour to respect himself *—
This being the first mail, since I had the honor to receive your flattering letter " I must beg you will excuse my apparent inattention and accept my most sincere thanks for your peculiarly friendly notice—I shall not attempt to portray my feelings on this occasion, but beg you to believe, that every effort will be made to perform the delicate and responsible trust, in correspondence with your kind expectations—My appointment was announced, previous to my arrival, with pleasing approbation If no disposition has been made, of the office of District Attorney”

<docbody>Dr SIR; The Act “Amending and supplementary to the act, for ascertaining claims and titles to land in the Territory of Florida and to provide for the survey and disposal of the public lands in Florida,”
was not long since, transmitted to this place by M. Hernandez.
Being the only Commissioner in West Florida, I without hesitation, assumed the responsibility of announcing, through the medium of the newspaper published at Pensacola, that our session had been pro-
<pb#699 />
longed until the second Monday of February, and that our office was open for the reception of claims, which must be filed before the first day of December next. I did not consider this measure entirely regular; but as it grew out of the necessity of the case and was calculated to accomplish the object in view, it was promptly adopted.—
Maj' Ware, had, some time previously, taken his departure from this place for the state of Mississippi, and had not returned. This step was urged, as I understood, by a regard to his own health, and that of his children, with the intention to return as soon as the third Commissioner and the law extending our term arrived, unless prevented by a continuance of the causes which produced his absence.
I have not yet heard from him and cannot state any thing positively as to his determination. It is rumored here, but with what correctness I cannot say, that he is upon a trip thro’ the Western country, and that he will not return to Pensacola. The continued ill health of his children has, no doubt, compelled him to adopt this alternative, and he will, it is presumed, resign his appointment as Commissioner.
Anticipating such an event, I have again considered it my duty to address you upon the subject. It is by no means my wish to be obtrusive; but feeling the solicitude I do for the public interest, it is to hoped the freedom in which I shall indulge will be pardoned. The performance of our duties has, heretofore, been so long suspended by disease, and other events, over which we had no controul, that it is very desirable we should now be enabled to make some progress.
The claimants are becoming impatient, and begin to express their dissatisfaction. Under such circumstances, I would respectfully recommend, that no time be lost in filling any vacances which might occur in the Board. I would again press upon your attention, the necessity of appointing Jos. M. White Esq of this place, to supply the first which may be presented.” He is better qualified than any other individual, either in or out of the Territory; and with myself, would be enabled to complete the business of the commission in the smallest practicable period. Were any other person selected, it would require a devotion of 3 or 4 months to the study of the claims, before he would be prepared to decide them. I do therefore, most sincerely hope, that Mr White may be appointed, should there be a vacancy, occasoned either by the resignations of Maj' Ware or Colo. Preston. If there are two vacancies, I would recommend Judge] G. A. Gaither, who has been sometime a practicing attorney at St. Augustine, and a member of the first] Legislative Council. He is well qualified, as to capacity, and an acquaintance with the laws and ordinances of Spain, and does not, I am advised, own a foot of land in the Territory, which is an important consideration. Judge Gaither will be at
<pb#700 />
Bardstown, Kentucky, where a notification of his appointment could be directed, and in a week afterwards, he could be transported by water to this place.—
With the most profound respect and esteem, I am y' mo. obt.

<docbody>JOHN RODMAN Esq."
SIR during my Continuance among the Small Keys, or Islands, in the Southern parts of the Coast of Florida, I made every exertion, in endeavouring to Obtain a Knowledge of the extent & Manner in which the Wrecking business, was Carried on & the effect, it had on the Revenue of the U" States—As this Subject appears to have Claim'd your Attention; I will endeavour in as concise a manner as possible, to lay before you, the result of my personal observations, togather with such other information, as I have been enabled to obtain, from those inhabitants residing among the Keys, whom I
had reasons to believe Entitled to Credit- and will at the same time, offer to you my opinion, as to those measures best calculated to Secure to the U" States, the duties on all Goods wreck'd on the Coast—The first Measure, which I would recommend, is the establishment of a Store House, on the Island of old Mattacombe (distant about 70 Miles, to the South of Cape Florida & 100 Miles to the North of Key West—) under the Superintendence of an Inspector of the Revenue, That he Should be furnished with a Revenue Cutter, of Sufficient force, to ensure prompt Submission to his Orders—, I
have been very credibly inform’d, that there are 120 Sail of Wessels, Kept employd from the Bahama Islands, within the Carrysford *
Reef, whose Sole employment is wrecking & Transporting over to Providence, Goods of this description, and that the Amount of duties, paid to the British Goverment in Nassau by those Wreckers, may fairly be estimated at £15,000 yearly—If the Wreckers, either American or British, are permitted, to Take possession of every article of this description, which may fall in their way; and dispose of them as they please; I would ask, where is the Security left to this Goverment, that the duties will be paid; the probability is, that but a Small portion of Goods, Wreck'd on this Coast, are ever Reported for payment of Duties—Your Inspector would be enabled to Collect all those Goods, in the Publick Store, and at the time of their reshipment, demand from the Captains or Owners, a Bond, for their being duly reported to the Custom House for payment of duties—. By placing the Revenue Cutter, under the Command of the inspector, he would be able to prevent the British Wreckers from taking those Goods out of the United States—before the duties were Secur’d—. This Trade has been injoy’d by the Inhabitants of the Bahama Islands, Since the first Settlement of those Keys—they appear to Consider it as their right, and are determin’d to persevere in it, untill our Goverment, by the adoption of Some energetick Measures, Shall Compell
<pb#705 />
them to withdraw—The extent of this Trade & the very Serious injury done to the Revenue of the U" States by the English Wreckers, may be estimated, by the number of Vessels employ'd in it—and also by the amount of Duties paid by them to the Custom House in Nassau-.
I mention'd to you, in my Letter of the 10 In" * that I had boarded the British Brig, Gen' Phipps' of 300 Tons, on the Reef, near to Key Tavanier The Captain & owner appeard to be a Man of an improv’d Mind, and possessing very general Commercial information, on the subject of this Letter we Convers'd very fully—He observed that there were a Number of British West Indiamen lost on the Reefe every year, that the property generally fell into the hands of the Wreckers, & that Such was their Conduct & general characters—he had reasons to believe, that the underwriters receiv'd but little Benefit from their assistance, That in all Cases, where a British Wessel was Wreck’d; it would afford much Satisfaction, to their Commander, to meet with some publick officer to whom they might commit, that part of their Cargo sav'd from the Wreck; & that the want of some Establishment of this Kind, was sensibly felt by all those Mariners, who were so unfortunate as to fall into, the hands of the Wreckers, It is therefore solely with the view, to save those Goods from falling into the hands of the Providence Wreckers, and the duties, on them totally lost to the U" States, that I would advise the immediate appointment of an Inspector, and the establishment of a Store House, near a Central part of the Reefe; The Island of old Mattacombe is situated near the most dangerous part of it, and has also the advantages of a good Harbour & good Water, another consideration is, that it is in sight of Key Tavaniere, the principal resort of all the Wreckers, from these reasons, & from a personal inspection of its Situation, &
advantages I have been led to Select it, as the most desireable place;
either for the Establishment of a Store House, or the Location of the Inspector—From this port, to Cape Florida, a distance of 250 Miles, there is no Settlement on the Coast & from the Cape to Key West a distance of 180 Miles, there is only one Settlement; thus in a distance of 430 Miles on our Coast, in the immediate Vicinity of the British Ports—there is no Custom House officer, or Revenue Cutter;—
When our Goverment take into their Consideration, the extent to which the Wrecking (and as intimate'ly connected with it, the Smugling) business is Carried on in this part of our Coast, and the great advantages which might accrue to our Revenue by this establishment; It is to be suppos'd, they will furnish the means, necessary to suppress this Evil-. By adopting this Plan, the temptations to Evade the Revenue Laws, would be decreas'd & Some Security afforded to the Goverment that the duty on Goods, wreck'd on owr Coast, would be Secur’d—from the nearness to Providence & also
<pb#706 />
to the Havannah, every facility is afforded for the introduction of foreighn Goods, among the Keys, and I will Venture to Assert, that there is no part of our Coast, that requires more the attention of the Goverment; at this time; than from Cape Florida, to the Tortugas's—
as respects the force & description of a Cutter to be Station'd there, I would observe; that She should not draw more than 4 feet Water;—.
a greater draught would prevent her acting with advantage—from her being Stationd on the most desolate part of our Coast and from it's being in the neighbourhood of Cuba; I would Consider it, absolutely necessary that her force & Equipment, should be respectable—.
Should our Government think proper to Carry, any part of these plans, into Execution & will give me the appointment, I will, immediately remove with my family & property to the Keys, Having been for Several years in our Navy & at a later period, in the Merchant Service, as Commander; I have the Confidence to believe, Should I be appointed Captain of a Revenue Cutter; that my Conduct as Such would merit the approbation of the Goverment & a continuance of it's Confidence—Respectfully Sir Yr Mo Ob"

<docbody>HON. JOHN QUINCEY ADAMS Secry of State for the U States SIR I have the honor to inform you that on saturday last the Legislative Council have commenced their Session. Nine members have appeared & more are not expected to attend. I have been compelled to rent an office for the Secretary, as none of the public buildings here which are tenantable are under my control, the Council occupy the only habitable room in the Governors old mansion, & it has been rendered so by Judge Smith, for the purpose of holding his Courts. I am obliged to get some cheap furniture for the Office but all of it will cost but little, as I shall have it made of Pine, & will only take as much as is absolutely necessary. I enclose you the Printers account for publishing the laws of the Territory, at this place Amo" $472.75, which I think too much. it would perhaps be best to allow no more than the price paid by Governm" for publishing the laws of the United States, this being once understood, the subject will give little trouble in future.
Last July, when the members of the Council arrived at Pensacola, several of them informed me, that the Archives & public records which had been delivered over to M* Edmund Law by Mr Worthington while acting Goveror, were very negligently kept, & that M Law had been in the habit of permitting persons to take out of his office as Alcalde original papers, & that on leaving S*Augustin to attend the Council at Pensacola he turned the papers over to some private individual, beleiving it my duty immediately to have the papers collected and placed in safe keeping, & to guard against any improper
<pb#708 />
conduct either in withdrawing from, or adding any papers to, the record. & as many of them were in loose sheets filed I directed M"
Gibbs & James S. Tingle Clerks of the superior & inferior courts of this City to take into their possession the papers, & make out an inventory of all the important ones so that if hereafter any fraud should be attempted it can be easily detected. this was done promptly
& these Gentlemen have preferred a Claim, for this service. I wrote to them that they would have to depend on the Gover" for such compensation as might be deemed reasonable. I trust Sir you will not consider my having directed this measure as an improper interference on my part. I was induced to do so from a conviction that serious injury would arise to the interest of the United States if I postponed acting until after I could communicate with you at Washington. I
wish to enquire if Congress at their late session made any appropriation for the payment of the expenses incurred in this City, in the Maintenance & prosecution of Criminals, the fees due to Cap"
Hanham the Sheriff are considerable, he has advanced the money himself & is now in serious distress for the want of it.
I is highly necessary in my opinion that the Secret” Col. Walton should return to Pensacola after the Council adjourns, the difficulty of communication between that City & this, retards in a great measure the operations of the local Government, & the sectional feeling that prevails in this territory makes it requisite that while I am in one section of the Country the Secret” should be in the other. I shall therefore direct his return to Pensacola, the want of his services &
advice will be sensibly felt by me. I must however under the present state of affairs submit to this inconvenience, I request of you or the President that some reasonable allowance from the contingent fund, may be paid to a Clerk, whom I shall be compelled otherwise to pay out of my salary, a very moderate allowance will be sufficient.
The People of East Florida are now well satisfied & I shall endeavor to discharge my duties so as to meet the approbation of the President and yourself, and preserve harmony among our Citizens.

<place-time>DEPMT of WAR 27* May 1823</place-time>
<docbody>HIS EXCELL" Win P DUVAL S*Augustine Florida SIR, Your letter of the 1* inst: enclosing your account as Superintendent of Indian Affairs, has been received.”
All the items in your account will be allowed, with the exception of that for clerk hire, office rent &" which cannot be allowed at the rate which you have charged. It is true, that the specific sum ($1500)
charged, has been allowed to Governors Clark," Cass" & Miller,” but the allowance was made to them under peculiar circumstances which are not considered at all applicable to your Superintendency.
For some time previous to the appointment of Gen Clark as Governor of the Missouri Territory, he acted under the authority of the President as Agent for Indian Affairs at S Louis with a salary of
$1500 per annum," and during which time no allowance was made to the gentleman, who preceded him as Governor of the Territory, on account of the duties performed by him as superintendent of Indian Affairs. But at the assumption of the duties of Governor, in 1813, by Gen'l Clark, the Office of Agent for Indian Affairs was abolished and the duties and authorities which were vested in him, were thereafter placed in the Governor, who, for the performance of the same as well as for clerk hire, office rent &" &° for the Indian Department was allowed the Salary previously given to the Agent.* The Governor of the Missouri Territory, by this arrangement, not only had to perform the duties of Indian Agent at S* Louis, where the intercourse with the Indians has always been great, but had also the control of all the Jndian Agencies on the Mississippi and Missouri, which rendered his duties in the Indian Department highly responsible and laborious;
and in consequence of which the specific allowance of $1500 a year was made to him as before stated; the whole of which was for incidental expenses necessarily incurred, or for extra compensation for extra services.
The same may be said as to the compensation of the Governor of the Michigan Territory who has under his control as Superintendent of Indian Affairs several Indian Agencies, some of which are located
<pb#710 />
without the limits of the Territory and the duties of which he is not bound by law to perform. Besides superintending the Agencies, he is charged with the immediate performance of the duties of Agent for the Indians residing within the Peninsula of Michigan; with paying the annuities which are to be paid by treaty at Detroit, amounting to a large sum & involving a heavy pecuniary responsibility; with the expense of attending to the numerous Indians that resort to that place, and with preventing the intercourse of the Indians within our limits with the British provinces: For which extra duties, as well as for clerk hire, office rent &" the specific allowance of $1500 was deemed not more than an adequate compensation, and is believed to be not much more than sufficient to cover his actual expenses.”
When General Miller entered on the duties of Governor of the Arkansas Territory, there was no agent to attend to the Osages and Quapaws, and he had a difficult negociation to effect between the Cherokees and Osages, who were at war, which required great personal exertions and expense in making long journies to meet these tribes for that purpose. Under these circumstances, the same allowance was at first made to him; but since a treaty of peace has been concluded between the Cherokees and Osages, and the trouble and expense has in consequence become less, the allowance has been reduced one half;
and is intended to cover all incidental expenses as well as for extra duty performed as Agent to the Osages and Quapaws, who have no agent, in paying their annuities &c."
It does not appear that any specific annual allowance was ever made to any governor of a territory for the performance of the duties of Superintendent of Indian Affairs as such. In the three cases mentioned, it was intended to secure the Governors against loss by the performance of such duties; and as extra compensation for the performance of extra duties.
Under all these circumstances, I have no doubt you will see the impossibility of extending to your Superintendency the rule adopted in the three cases referred to. I am perfectly willing, however, to place you on a footing with respect to compensation, with the Governors of every other Territory who have acted as Superintendents of Indian Affairs—that is, to allow you, (if it should be necessary in the discharge of your duties as Superintendent of Indian Affairs to keep an office and employ a clerk,) a reasonable sum for that purpose; and also the expenses which you may necessarily incur in your intercourse with the Indians. As it would perhaps be difficult to keep an exact account of your expenses when travelling on business with the Indians, or otherwise engaged in attending to their concerns, the allowance will be made on your certificate of honor as to the actual amount of
<pb#711 />
such expenses. But as the Florida tribe is very small and their intercourse with S*Augustine limited; and as there is a subagent for the post who might be charged with the duties of attending to such Indians as may visit it, my impression is that you will not find a clerk necessary, at least while he is present, and that if an Office be indispensable, an arrangement might be made by which you could be accommodated in one of the public buildings. If, however, you should find it necessary to employ a clerk and rent an Office, you will immediately report the name of your clerk with the rate of compensation allowed him, as well as that for the Office, for the determination of this Department.”

SIR, Your letters of the 22" * & 26" ulti° * have been received.
You appear to understand perfectly the ground on which the allowances were made to the Superintendents of Indian affairs in Missouri, Michigan and Arkansas. The number of Indian Tribes
& Agencies under the control of each of the two former; and the peculiar State of Indian Affairs in the Arkansas Territory at the time the latter entered on his duties, rendered a special allowance necessary to cover their actual expenses and secure them against loss on account of the duties performed by them respectively in the Indian Department. In no other cases has a special annual allowance been made.
Had the practice been uniform, there would have been no difficulty in your case, but as it has not I cannot admit your account. From the very candid view you have taken of the subject, I feel convinced you will see the propriety of this decision and cheerfully acquiesce in it. If you had actually incurred expenses in the performance of duties in the Indian Department they would have been allowed without hesitation.
The additional instructions which you have given to the Indian Agent are very proper, and it is hoped will be strictly attended. The draft of the Agent for his first quarter's Salary has been presented here and paid. With regard to the solicitude of the Indians about there future location, you are already apprized that Commissioners

<place-time>S*AUGUSTINE 11 June 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR Since writing you on the 26" Ult” Mr Segui and myself have had a consultation with Several of the Principal chiefs of the Seminole Tribe, and have fixed on the vicinity of S*Augustine and the 5" of September next as the place & time of holding the Treaty—An earlier period could not have been selected without serious injury to the Indian, by trespassing on the harvest season, and without precluding the possiblity of a general attendance from the dispersed condition of the Florida Indians occupying a territory of more than
500 miles in extent—The absence of the Agent from S' Marks, and the uncertainty of letters addressed to Pensacola being received by him in time to accomplish the views of the Commissioners, have necessarily forced us to communicate direct with the different Tribes notifying them to attend at the time and place designated—Expresses have been dispatched in every direction, and the Indians generally have been distinctly impressed with the idea that a Treaty of amity settlement & limits, conformable to the views of the American government, would be concluded, and that those Tribes who neglect the invitation, or obstinately refuse to attend, will be Considered as embraced within the compact formed and forced to comply with its provisions—
<pb#715 />
You have probably been advised, or may collect from the various reports made to the War Department on Indian Affairs in Florida;
that there is not the most friendly disposition prevailing between the different Tribes, and that there is quite a division of opinion among them as to their concentration and location—The Indians occupying the Peninsula, it is believed, are pleased with the Selection, South, made by the Executive; while those West of the Sewaney river, and particularly within the Appalachecola district are most attached to their own Country and would prefer it is said even an emigration West of the Mississippi to a concentration South of Tampa Bay as contemplated—At the head of the discontented is Eneomatla, an enterprising daring Savage, and if not the only, among the principal instigators of the Seminole War—These conflicting interests, and opinions will be the chief difficulties the Commissioners will have to encounter in effecting a treaty; and although there is no doubt as to the ability in the national Government of dictating & enforcing the terms desired;
a resort to that Alternative, as a matter of policy, may be questionable, where the views of the Executive may be effected otherwise amicably—
Magnanimity would dictate the latter course; however necessary an exercise of power may be in extreme cases—It has been thought proper to present these facts to your consideration, suggesting the policy of additional instructions to the Commissioners conditionally authorising them to provide for those Tribes that may be disposed to emigrate West—It is possible that all the Florida Indians might be induced to remove, and if so an object as vitally important in a national as a territorial point of view would be gained—Florida as a maritime district of the American union is peculiarly exposed; possessing more than 900 miles of sea coast with Capacious bays or Estuaries easy of access; and her good to her inferior lands bearing but a small proportion and the territory consequently unsusceptible of a dense population, she must ever be as internally weak as she is externally assailable
—An Indian population under these circumstances, connected with another class of population which will inevitably predominate in Florida, must necessarily add to natural weaknesses, and endanger the security of one of the most exposed, but important frontiers of the Union—It is useless therefore to enlarge on the policy of removing a class of Savages from where they may prove dangerous, to where they would be comparatively harmless—Should the Executive approve of the views taken on this Subject, it will be necessary for the guidance of the Commissioners, minutely to designate the district of country West which may be offered in exchange for the Country abandoned—
In connection with the concentration of the Indians South of Tampa Bay, there are many subjects to which your attention may with propriety be invited—The Indians hitherto have been formidable in Florida, and the change of flags has not removed from the Citisens all
<pb#716 />
apprehensions, or all recollections of former impressions—The location, South, is by some thought injudicious, and though a large majority concur with the Executive in the views taken on the Subject, all agree that a Military Post within or near the limits of the nation will be indispensable—The Indians have long been in the habit of keeping up an intercourse, and active trade with the Cuba Fishermen, and to this cause principally has been ascribed the encouragement hitherto given to absconding negroes & savage depredations committed on cattle Estates &c.—There is no difficulty in correcting the evil hereafter;
but the presence of a military force will be necessary to the result and the sooner the position is selected & occupied the sooner will the excitements to illict trafic be removed—The first impressions are with the Savage most permanent, & a judicious location of an adequate force simultaneous with the concentration of the Indians cannot but have the happy effect of obtaining such a controul as to render them perfectly Subservient to the views of Government—From conversations held with many who have explored partially the western Coast of Florida, I am inclined to think that the Bay of Tampa presents the most eligible site for a Military Post & offers many favourable &
healthful positions—More ample information however on the subject shall be collected, previous to the accomplishment of the object of our mission; in time to be acted on should the occupation of the position suggested be approved—
Will you be good enough to issue orders to the Coms Officer at S” Augustine to furnish the Commissioners with a Military Guard;
issue led & powder & afford such facilities as may be thought calculated to promote the objects of the mission As the want of appropriation for holding a treaty must necessarily limit the presents, always expected on such occasions, the propriety of sending 8 or 10 Rifles to be distributed as a particular mark of distinction to some of the principal chiefs is respectfully suggested to your consideration Your Obt S JAMES GADSDEN

SIR, Your letter of the 27" Ult” enclosing a copy of a letter from you to M. Dexter, and of his answer and accompanying report of the State of the Seminole Indians, has been received.”
I observe that you have conferred the appointment of Sub-Agent on M* Dexter. The appropriation for the Pay of Sub Agents is a Specific one, and provides for no more than were actually in service at the time it was made, consequently the appointment of Mr Dexter cannot be confirmed. Cap" Pelham who holds the appointment of Sub-Agent, & who has been for some time absent from his post (S"
Augustine) in consequence of the bad state of his health, has been requested to report to this Department when he will probably return to his station, and it is presumed from his last letter he will be able to do so before long, and that when there he will be entirely competent to perform the duties of the Indian Department under your direction for East Florida without the appointment of an additional Sub-Agent.
Should the Office of Sub-Agent become vacant, I shall have no objection to your filling the vacancy with a suitable person who may be agreeable to you; reporting the name of the person, however, to this Department for its approbation. The Salary of the Sub-Agent is fixed by law, at $500 per annum."

<docbody>GENERAL, I had the honor to receive this day your letter of the
15* Ulto." & at the same time one from the 3"Auditor notifying me that $5000, was in a course of remittance; the draft has not yet come to hand. This sum, though not sufficient to liquidate all claims against the quartermaster's department here, yet it will pay off those debts I had contracted for building materials & other supplies, and which I had pledged my word should be paid by the end of this month. On these conditions I had succeeded in obtaining the articles
<pb#718 />
at quite as low a rate as if I had paid Cash. It will be necessary for me to go to New Orleans for the funds on the draft when it arrives.—
In obedience to your order of 6* December last,” I took possession of the block-houses except the one occupied by the civil authorities which they had converted into a school-room. About ten days since I wanted the one, occupied by the Collector, for a subsistence Storehouse, & it was accordingly given up to me; the provisions however can be removed to one more remote from the Bay shore, which I shall have done forthwith, and reinstate the Collector in possession. I
selected this particular house for the depot of provisions, because it was nearer the water's edge; and also a more secure building than the others. The Government-house I have never interfered with. There will now remain in my possession two block-houses; and the Hospital which I shall rent if practicable. It would be better to have the depot of provisions at the Cantonment than in Town & I contemplate building a Store-house there for the purpose so soon as the barracks are finished. Suitable issuing houses for the Commissary have been erected already. This site unites many advantages for a permanent cantonment; for being on a navigable Bayou or Lagoon it is easily supplied; the position is elevated and dry with abundance of excellent Springs. The buildings are constructed in the most durable &
permanent manner; much yet remains to be done to complete them, but when finished they will be the most comfortable in the southern country; and they will have been built at a comparatively small expense. I design, so soon as I can get the proper materials, to furnish you a sketch of the country in the immediate vicinity of the Cantonment, extending it so as to include the Barrancas.—
Your instructions relative to the Roads which ought, or might be opened to communicate with the interior shall be particularly attended to. There is at present a good carriage road from this place to Blakely, from whence is a Steam-ferry-Boat to Mobile; also a direct road leading from here to Fort Claiborne on the Alabama River, from whence roads communicate with every part of the interior of the State. There is no road to Mobile point & any which can be opened will be circuitous. There is a trail however to Red Bluffs on Mobile Bay, from whence it is, by water, Eighteen miles to the Point. The road of primary importance to this place & to the country generally, penetrating into the interior in a northerly direction is that I recommended to be opened to Fort Mitchell on the Chattahoochie River, via Beeler's ferry, in my letter of the 5* Instant.” I regret that I
am not yet able to travel over these routes, & ascertain by personal
<pb#719 />
observation what difficulties, if any, do exist. There is not one however that I have mentioned, but of which I have some personal knowledge & know that they are travelled by Wagons in their present situation. Every day however increases my strength & I trust that in a few weeks more I shall be able to examine the Country & be more competent to give you the desired information.

<place-time>U. S. Attorney's Office—W. F. PENSACOLA 16th June 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, It is with regret that I have to state the destruction of the Public timber in West-Florida is at this time so very considerable that a few years continuance of the depredations to the extent heretofore practised, must inevitably occasion a scarcity of the more valuable
<pb#720 />
timber of this province—the live oak, red cedar & locust, which are found indeed no where else in the U. S. in such perfection as here.
It has been Sir, my endeavor to punish the defaulters directly in person, or indirectly by the seizure of the timber, but the timidity of some of the executive Officers has defeated the intention and the offenders profit largely by the impunity thus secured. The U. S.
Marshal of this District declines acting at all in the matter until regular processes are placed in his hands so as to entitle him to mileage
&c. for the arrest. Process, in most cases of this kind cannot possibly be issued, because of the sparseness of our population which bars a mutual acquaintance, & the mobility of that class who are the depredators, and who locate themselves temporarily for the purpose of this illicit traffick—the information of these spoliations is thus usually had from Travellers by land, or Coasting Wessels touching here on their Voyages, so that the names of the offenders cannot be ascertained.
It is perceived Sir, that by an Act passed at the First Session of the Seventeenth Congress "—the President of the U. S. is authorized to take such “measures as may be deemed adviseable for the preservation of the timber of the U. States in Florida, I have therefore the honor to request any proper information which may be in the Department of State relative to this subject for nothing seems known here of any measures taken under the said Act, and as the information of these trespasses is usually lodged in this Office it is desirable to know the proper course.
While remarking upon the absence of information in this matter from the office of the U.S. Attorney in this District, it may be added that from the sudden death of my predecessor " and the confusion consequent upon the terrible pestilence here—that every public paper, pamphlet &c. of this Office is missing—so that the Attorney is without any instructions or communications whatever from either of the Public Departments from the period of the organization of the Government of the Floridas, down to January 1823.—If therefore any communications have been made by either of the Public departments to the U. S. Attorney for this District, during the said time and which are to govern in Office it will be necessary that copies should be furnished to the present Attorney."—

United States Attorney's Office W. F.
PENSACOLA 16** June 1823
SIR, I have deemed it my duty to address you upon the Subject of the Spoliations daily committing in this Quarter of the Union upon the Public domain.
Upon my arrival here I learned that Several Mercantile houses in this and other places were engaged in Purchasing and shipping timber cut upon the Public lands in W. Florida, and that their contracts were avowedly made with the Trespassers, knowing them to be Such.
Since entering upon the duties of this Office, two Wessels have cleared at the Custom House for New-York & Philad" having each on board considerable quantities of Cedar and live Oak timber, which is universally beleived to have been cut upon the Public lands.—On two occasions I have received information that Strong parties were felling and Squaring timber from the Public lands at the distance of 100 miles on the Coast, eastward of this, and in one instance I was Satisfactorily assured that a burthensome vessel from Nassau (NP.) had arrived in the Apalachicola River with a Cargo of Salt—& was to take a return Cargo of Timber obtained as above mentioned.—
Upon application to the Collector here to refuse clearances to Vessels leaving such timber on board, he declines, thinking it not his duty, & the U. S. Marshall & deputies do not deem it their duty to proceed to arrest or Seize without a formal & regular process— and as I Know not how far I am authorized to call upon the Naval or Military force, the defaulters escape amid all these difficulties with perfect impunity.
These depredations are carried on now to Such an extent, that I have held myself bound Sir, to make it the subject of a particular communication to the head of the Treasury department as a Special guardian of the Public domain, and to solicit any instructions upon this Subject which perchance may have been sent to my Predecessor, but which I have never seen—From the Act passed in 1822 for the Preservation of the Public timber in Florida, I am led to believe that Congress have deemed it a matter of some moment and that some steps have been taken by the President under the Act."
I have the honor to be Sir Very Respectfully Your most Obed" S*

City of St. Augustine. On the twenty-ninth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, personally came before me, WAT, as Surra, May, -
of St. Augustine, Eusebius Gomez, who being duly sworn, doth : ''
that On the evening of the 18th or 19th instant, Alexander Hamilton, in a £:
sation with this deponent, remarked that he very much regretted his having interfred in the business of the late Father Crosby, and depriving deponent's brother the parish clergyman, John N. Gomez, of the charge of the property: and by so in:
terfering, Mr. Hamilton observed that the whole of the old inhabitants of the town were dissatisfied with him. Mr Hamilton then remarked, that as he was one of the board of Land Commissioners, it was the interest of the i...habitants of the town to Vote for him as delegate; for they generally had lots of ground the titles to which were conditional, and if they voted for him it would be in his power to serve th: m at the Board in confirming their titles—but if they veted for Mir. Hernandez or any other that as a man, he (Mr. Hamilton) could not but feel resentment; and when their claims came before the Board of Commissioners, they wou'd have to depend s rictly upon their legal titles. Mr Hamilton then requested this deponent, if he had ally influence with the Minorcans, # they were ignorant) to make them understand that by giving their votes for him (Hamilton) it would be much to their advantage, as he would then be in their fivour. Mr. Hamilton again remarked, if they do not give their votes for me, they must expect to feel my resentment.

Aloridians and Fellow Citizens.-One of the most sacred duties of mankind in society, is that of making themselves useful to it.-Penetrated with this maxim and persuaded that I should render you a service of the greatest importance, I presented myself on the 29th ultimo to the mayor of this City Waters Smith, Esq. for the purpose of making an affadavit, the same which begins this manifesto, and which I confirm, being perfectly convinced of its truth, of which in proper time I will produce such proofs as will convince the world that you are notmistaken in your certificate of my conduct, reputation and character.
Fellow Citizens, the language of truth has been ever my guide, my breast has been incapable of fostering an untruth, and permit me to say, without a blemish on my reputation, that I despise the detestable language of
“ damned rascal.” “damned liar,” and “base fabrication,” with which Mr. Hamilton wishes to veil the truth and defame me, as these are the only subterfuges which those, like himself, use when they find their abominable designs of making their fortune on the ruin of their fellow creatures, discovered.
It would be more grateful to me to present this statement to you in the English language, but although I am acquainted with it sufficiently to understand and to be understood verbally, I do not possess it with that perfection so for writing it, neither have I wished to trouble my friends on the subject.
necessary Your affectionate Fellow citizen, EUSEBIUS MA. GOMEZ.

[Contemporary Translation]
To James Monroe President of the United States The undersigned, inhabitants of St. Augustine East Florida and Land Holders respectfully sheweth, that they understand you have been pleased to appoint Colonel Alexander Hamilton as one of the three Commissioners for the examination and adjudication of grants made by the Spanish Government to the inhabitants of this Territory.
The admirable silence with which your Petitioners have at all times suffered the yoke of despotism and oppression is at once a convincing proof of their pacific disposition, with submission to the Laws and respects and obedience to the authorities, from which maxims the Floridians have never swerved—but, Sir, terminate in part those unfortunate Epochs, and permit your petitioners to say that the above named Col. Alexander Hamilton does not possess those good qualities that ought to adorn a Public Officer, who as he has stated, has it in his power to decide the fate of nearly all the inhabitants; and abusing your goodness, that is to say, taken advantage of the appointment of Land Commissioner he offered himself as a Candidate for Delegate to represent the Territory of Florida, persuaded that either by threats, 
<pb#727 />
or delusive offers he could blind the greatest part of the well meaning inhabitants for the purpose of obtaining their suffrages, as he has done with the incautious, and transient persons—
Your Petitioners are well aware that they cannot in any wise, nor ought they to present their Titles to the Land Commissioners whilst said Hamilton is a member thereof, as it would expose them to the resentment with which he has threatened them, and which he has clearly manifested, as is seen in the accompanying documents numbered 1. & 2*
Agreeable therefore to proofs so evident and confiding in the Justice and rectitude of your Excellency, your petitioners humbly request you will be pleased excuse their having addressed you in Spanish, as being the Language most familiar to them, and at the same time to depose Col: Alexander Hamilton as Land Commissioner and name any other person you may think proper, and your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray—

<docbody>SIR: I have the honor to send for you information, copy of a letter to the Captain General of Cuba,” which so fully explains the object of writing it, that it leaves little more for me to say, than that I hope the course pursued by me will meet your approbation.”
<pb#728 />
I am under the impression that the practice of wrecking Spanish vessels on our coast, by Colombian cruisers, in order to secure their cargoes, has, for a long time past, been pursued to a considerable extent, and that the establishment at Key Vacas was made with this object chiefly in view.
I feel myself somewhat at a loss how to act in this business, which appears to be one of peculiar delicacy. I thought that the first proper step was to remove all cause of suspicion and complaint from the authorities of Cuba, reserving to myself the right of acting as circumstances might hereafter make necessary.
I beg your early instructions on this subject both as regards the disposal of the property and the course I ought to pursue toward the cruiser, (which claims the character of a Government vessel,) if she should be detected, and the individuals (aiders and abettors) residents at Key Wicas.
The goods from that place are, invariably, I am informed, sent to Norfolk, where, it is likely, a strict scrutiny might detect a more extensive concern.

S. P., Naval Affairs, I, 1103–1121, II, 221–230; some of this correspondence is also printed in Goodrich, loc. cit. Still other letters concerning the squadron appear in A. S. P., op. cit., I, 989–1003. The manuscript copies of the letters received from Porter, which are considerably more numerous than those published in the places cited, are to be found in NA (ND, SN, Captains’ Lets., 1823, I-VI); letters to him from the Secretary of the Navy are in NA(ND, SN Lets. to Officers Ships of War, Bk.
14, 15). Additional letters concerning the West Indian squadron can be found in the correspondence files of the Board of Navy Commissioners. These as well as the records of the office of the Secretary of the Navy are described in U.S. National Archives, Record Group No. 45: Naval Records Collection of the Office of Naval Records and Library; Preliminary Checklist of the Naval Records Collection of the Office of Naval Records and Library 1775–1910, comp. by James R. Masterson
(Washington, 1945). At the end of 1824 Commodore Porter was recalled to Washington for an investigation of his transactions at Foxardo, Puerto Rico connected with the suppression of piracy. Several compilations of documents that resulted from the court of inquiry and the court martial that were held in the following year contain numerous references to Key West where the West Indian squadron was based. See the following works: Robert Beale, A Report of the Trial of Commodore David Porter . . . before a General Court Martial (Washington, 1825); David Porter, An Exposition of the Facts and Circumstances Which Justified the Expedition to Foxardo and the Consequences Thereof. Together with the Proceedings of the Court of Inquiry Thereon, Held by Order of the Hon. Secretary of the Navy (Washington, 1825); David Porter, Minutes of Proceedings of the Courts of Inquiry and Court Martial, in Relation to Captain David Porter: Convened at Washington, D.C., on Thursday, the Seventh Day of July A. D. 1825 (Washington, 1825); Memoir, David Porter, passim; A. S. P., Naval Affairs, II, 132-440.
Other manuscript documents are to be found in the correspondence files of the Secretary of the Navy in NA.
<pb#729 />
As wrecking, on this coast, is a business of great importance, and extensively carried on, I should be glad to be informed whether there are any laws to regulate it. Previous to my coming here, the neighboring Keys were much frequented by English wreckers who took the property to New Providence, but the detention of two of them by Lieut. Com" Watson" occasioned an alarm which has since kept them from the coast. A correspondence took place between the Governor of Bahama and myself on the subject which I have the honor to enclose you.
It is my opinion that much smuggling, if not already practised will be attempted. It is out of the power of any Custom House officer here to prevent it; and, having had some experience in these matters while at New Orleans, I know that, without being clothed with some authority from the Treasury Department, I can not lawfully make a seizure. Whatever powers are given to me I will exercise whenever the public interest may require it, and I solicit from you early instructions how I am to proceed."

<docbody>SIR: Apprehending that the Secretary of the Navy may be absent from Washington, I have taken the liberty of sending you a copy of my communication to him on a subject which claims an early attention.
The absence of the Collector and Inspector, and the death of the Deputy Collector has left no protection here to the Revenue but myself. I have not allowed vessels coming from foreign ports to land their cargoes, but have sent them elsewhere, persuaded, as I am, that there can be no motive in their doing so, but the interest which they hope to derive from illicit practices.
To vessels going coast-wise I give a certificate stating the cargo, if any, and the fact that there are no revenue officers there.
There are no Custom House fees collected however, and this is the only inconvenience felt from the want of a Collector, a consideration not worth taking into account as the number of vessels which arrive and depart is so limited.

DEAR SIR. I take the liberty to enclose a correspondence which took place between M Rodman and myself immediately upon my return—
You have also an electioneering affidavit made under the auspices of Joseph M Hernandez as interpreter together with one from me in reply—The conversation attributed to me by Mr. Gomez was undoubtedly attributed to some of my friends and as unquestionably remonstrated against by me—If I had been disposed I could have secured my election through two individuals deeply interested in grants. The charge against me is too idle an attack upon my understanding to be noticed other than as a satisfaction to yourself—The Grantees well know that my integrity is unimpeachable and are imposing upon a few ignorant Minorcans who are in possession of city lots that are unquestionably private property-
I have formed no opinion nor do I entertain any prejudice in hostility to any discription of claims—
Permit me to add that this is a most despicable community. I mean the inhabitants of S’ Augustine-
By the enclosed notice you will percive, the Spanish Consul is inviting his countrymen to embark for Cuba"—This day 29 persons sail for the Havana and in the course of the week a large Schooner loaded with passengers will depart-
I beg you will excuse the intrusion, I should have addressed myself to Doctor Everett, but I am not aware that he is at present with you—

- - [May 31, 1823]
Territory of Florida City of St Augustine On the thirty first day of May one thousand eight hundred and twenty three, personally appeared Alexander Hamilton before me Joseph L. Smith Judge of the Superior Court, who being duly sworn doth depose and say that he never did remark in any conversation with Eusebio M* Gomez, that he regretted having deprived John N
Gomez of the charge of the estate of the deceased Michael Crosby, but that on the contrary he informed him that he regretted there should exist any prejudice with the Minorcans in relation to the part he took in that transaction, which as a public officer he was obliged to do and also informed the said Gomez that as the Counsel of the Heirs of Michael Crosby, the claim of his brother John N Gomez could not be allowed and that he must make his claim through the law—And this deponent doth further say that when conversing with the said Gomez in reference to the approaching election, he complained of the unfairness of Joseph M Hernandez and his friends, in attempting to excite prejudice against the deponent, in consequence of his being a Commissioner and he doth solemnly swear that he never did intimate or declare to the said Gomez “that as he was one of the board of Land Commissioners, it was the interest of the inhabitants of the Town to vote for him as Delegate; for they generally had lots of ground the titles to which were conditional and if they voted for him, it would be in his power to serve them at the board in confirming their titles, but if they voted for Hernandez or any other person, that as a man he could not but feel resentment and when their claims came before the Land Commissioners they would have to depend strictly upon their legal titles”—And that he never did intimate directly or indirectly to the said Gomez that the Minorcans were to expect either favour or resentments from whatever part they should take in the election, but that on the contrary he has freequently cautioned his friends to avoid making assertions of such a character and that he unequivocally and expressly declared to John B. Strong Esq that his feelings never could be biassed or influenced by such considerations and this Deponent doth challenge any person to assert that he has ever in the most distant manner held out any allurements or offered any inducements as Land Commissioner or otherwise as the consideration of their support and this Deponent doth further say that he has requested the friends of the Gentlemen applying for the Secretaryship of the Board of Commissioners, not to converse with him on that subject,

SIR D Simmons having called on me this morning and demanded, in your behalf, personal satisfaction for a publication issued by me, and alleged to contain reflections injurious to your Character, I replied to him, that I could not consistently with my principles, consider it as one of the few cases in which such a resort is Justifiable.
Considering it, however, as due to that Justice which I always wish to practice; and Yielding also, to the desire of our mutual friends, I
observed, that I would willingly submit all the Circumstances of the Case to Gentlemen of honor and probity, by whose decision I would be guided.
Understanding from D. S. in the course of our conversation, that you considered me as the Agressor, by the note which I addressed to you, apprising you of my having been employed to Commence a suit against you for a Libel; and perfectly recollecting that I had not the remotest intention of offending you, by that notification, I
have no hesitation in saying that I did not, in the letter referred to, design to Convey the slightest injury to your feelings. Your reply, it appears, from what D* S. has stated to me, was founded upon a mistaken apprehension of my meaning. Having given this explanation of the purport of the note in question, you will, I trust, see that it is due to Justice and to my feelings to acknowledge that your letters to me were written under an erroneous impression.
The suit instituted against you having been brought in a Court now abolished, I am disposed to do every thing in my power consistent with my professional duty to put a stop to it.
I am, Sir, Your obt. Servt.

SIR In reply to your letter of this days date, which I have Just received, allow me to state, that the publication you complain of, and the reflections which it Contains upon your understanding and Character, originated in the injured feelings excited by the letters which you addressed to me, from a misapprehension (as you acknowledge, under the explanations I have given) of the meaning of my first note;
and also from various exasperating reports brought to me respecting your intentions against my interest and Character. The publication, at that time, I thought but a Just retaliation. Those groundless charges then, sprang solely from feelings of resentment.
In thus giving them their proper Character I make every Concession to truth and Justice towards both our Characters required, and which your Own Candor will Justly appreciate.

SIR, Your letter of the 11" inst has been received.”
I agree with you as to the importance to the Territory of Florida of removing the Indians west of the Mississippi; but there are no lands which the Government can assign to them in lieu of those they may abandon, as all the public lands in that direction, that could be so disposed of, are occupied either by the Cherokees or Choctaws. The Government is, however, willing to encourage the removal of the Florida Indians as far as it can, and if all, or any part of them should be disposed to emigrate, and join the Cherokees or Choctaws or any other tribe farther west, that may be willing to receive them, you are authorized to include a stipulation in the proposed treaty on the subject, allowing them in the event of their emigration what may be deemed by the Commissioners a fair consideration for the lands relinquished by them in Florida, and agreeing on the part of the United States to pay the expenses attending their removal.
Your suggestion relative to the establishment of a military post will receive due attention.
<pb#735 />
Orders will be given agreeably to your request thro’ the Adjutant General to the Commanding Officer at St Augustine to furnish the Commissioners with a military guard. -
The Rifles required for the presents at the treaty will be furnished thro’ the Ordnance Department.
The President has directed that the Governor of the Territory as is usual be associated with the Commissioners at the proposed treaty, and he will join you accordingly and aid in the negociation.
He was not put on the Commission originally on account of his absence from the Territory.”
The Indian Agent has been ordered to repair to St Augustine, where he will be stationed until further orders, which will enable the Commissioners to avail themselves of his services.” -

SIR: The gentleman whom you left at Key West as Deputy Collector, has died since your departure from it." I understand that he caught the yellow fever at Havana, and died shortly after his return.
Your presence is therefore indispensable; the more so as the revenue Cutter is now ready for service.
Until you arrive, or until another Deputy can be appointed, all business at the Custom House must be suspended. I have had several intimations that a plan was in contemplation to enter coffee and
<pb#738 />
other West India articles there for re-shipment to other ports of the Union. As it is difficult to conceive any fair or honest motive for such a course, the suspicion naturally arises that illicit practices will be resorted to by those who engage in it. It will therefore be an imperious duty to exercise the strictest inspection, and the utmost vigilance as to the solvency of those who offer themselves to bond duties at the Custom House. The best security among persons of doubtful credit will be a deposite of a sufficient portion of the merchandise to secure the payment of the duties.

<docbody>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. STATES
SIR, Before I left Augustine, I learnt that a statement respecting Colonel Hamilton, had been secretly circulated obtained various signatures of Minorcans and Spaniards resident in Augustine and been forwarded to you.”
The statement it was understood, consisted of allegations or declarations, claimed to have been made by Col Hamilton, pending the late Election in Florida, as to the course he would pursue as Commissioner of Land Claims, in regard to those Electors who might vote for or against him on that occasion, and ended with a request to the President of the United States for his removal.
The Election was attended with great warmth & personal excitement. M Hamilton was one of the Candidates—And from this fact, & the strong attachment of the Spaniards and Minorcans to M.” Hernandez the other Candidate, have been produced all the false impressions and misapprehensions, which have led to the statement against Col Hamilton. But I do not believe Sir, that there is a person of intelligence & integrity in Augustine who doubts the official honour
& integrity of Col Hamilton—or who unexcited by passionate feelings, produced as I have stated, would have made an allegation against him.
His appointment as Commissioner was acceptable and popular in East Florida—It still may be viewed substantially so—the excitement must soon pass off, which grew out of the Election—M* Gomez to whom M Hamilton was said to have made the objectionable remarks
<pb#739 />
has but a very limited knowledge of English, and is most liable to misapprehend what he hears in that Language-On his own application I excused him from serving as a Juror, because as he said his knowledge of the English language was too deficient.
I know nothing against the integrity of M* Gomez—he is called an honest man—but I believe with those here, who best know M* Hamilton, that the utmost reliance may be placed on his integrity—&
that his official duties will be discharged faithfully.
I have taken the liberty Sir, to write this letter, from a regard to justice, & in the hope that it may prevent any undeserved impression being made on your mind, from the communication, which it is supposed you have received. I was not the partisan of Col Hamilton at the late Election—I was not a voter—and I now address you Sir, without his knowledge & without intending that he shall know that I have written to you on this subject.”

<docbody>SIR; I have patiently remained here until this time, under the expectation, either that Colo. Preston would arrive, or the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Maj' Ware be filled," so that a Board might be formed, and enabled to proceed in the execution of their Commission. In this calculation, I have been much disappointed.
I have not yet been advised who will succeed Maj' Ware, or when the arrival of Colo. Preston may be expected. This state of things is to be regretted the more, inasmuch as the claimants are extremely solicitous to have their titles ascertained and adjusted, and as we have been already exposed to unusual delay in the accomplishment of this object. Besides, the United States are greatly interested in expediting the business of the Commissioners, so as to bring it to an early close, and enable them speedily to expose their lands to sale.—
I have already recommended several persons to fill the vacancy of Maj. Ware, as well as that of Colo. Preston, should it occur. I feel myself again urged to call your attention to this subject, and should it be considered too inportunate, I am in hopes you will excuse it, and attribute it to a sincere desire to progress with the performance of my duties. To continue here during the Summer and Fall, exposed to the diseases incident to those seasons in this climate, without any
<pb#740 />
prospect of forming a Board, is a delay which is extremley discouraging and painful, and from which I should be much pleased to be relieved.—
M. Joseph M. White of this place, has been repeatedly pressed upon your attention, as better qualified to fill either of those vacancies, than any individual who could be selected. He is a gentleman in whom the people here repose every confidence, and his appointment, I am assured, would meet with universal approbation. He was recommended because he was known to you, and from a consciousness of his qualifications. A regard to the intraests of the claimants and the United States, again constrain me to urge the appointment of M” White to fill the first vacancy that is presented. It is particularly desirable as it respects the speedy and faithful execution of our duties.
If two new members of the Board join me, who are unacquainted with the laws and ordinances of Spain &c. in the distribution of lands, almost the whole burthen, at this stage of the business, will be thrown upon me.” This is more than my present state of health would bear, impaired as it has been by the irregularities and inclemency of the past seasons. With the aid of M" White, who is well acquainted with the duties to be performed, we could proceed with but little difficulty.
No delay could arise, as he is on the spot, and the whole business could be taken up and dispatched with fidelity and promptitude. I should be greatly gratified to find, that these views have met your approbation.”—
With evry sentiment of respect & esteem, I am y' mo. Obt Sevt.

it being impossible to cross the reef, from the Situation this Wessel Was then in, With any prospect of Overtaking her, I did not attempt it: but proceeded directly to Key Vaccas, With the hope of meeting her there. I arrived at the Key on the 7" remained there untill the

<place-time>HERMITAGE July 14th 1823</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR, I see from the Public Journals that a Treaty is to be held with the Seminole Indians in September next, -the object of which is to concentrate them at some point within the Peninsula, and to mark & lay off a boundary for them.
I believe without vanity I may say, that I am well acquainted with the Indian character, and I have no hesitation in saying that that the Government will experience some difficulty in concentrating the Florida Indians at the proposed point in the Peninsula, they being
<pb#742 />
only the Renegado Creeks who have wandered there. A movement of the Troops to Tampas bay, previous to the Talks being held with them, would have a powerful influence upon their minds, and give great effect to the Talks of the commissioners: Will you therefore permit me to suggest to te you the propriety of sending to Tampas bay, one half of the 4" Reg' of Infantry now at Pensacola? It would have a very beneficial effect. I have fully communicated to Co' Gadsden my ideas on the subject of the approaching negotiation, and would further suggest the propriety of giving to the commissioners discretionary powers to locate the Indians, either, within the Peninsula, or, on both sides of the Apelachicola extending,-West ten miles,—
East to Oclockney River, and South within five miles of the Ochesee Bluffs—Here they can be concentrated, and will leave a free communication from East to West Florida crossing the Apelachicola at the Ochesee Bluffs; and all the good lands on the Choctaw Hatche, and East of the Oclockney to the Alatchua plains, and on the margin of the Gulph, preserved for a dense White population,-sufficient to overawe the Indians, and keep down the insurrection of the Blacks, of which there must be a large number in the Floridas at some future day.
If it be the particular desire of the Executive to make this concentration within the Peninsula, permit me again to repeat, that the appearance of a Garrison of Regulars at Tampas bay will be necessary to effect it at the desired point. Nothing short of this, as I believe, will procure it,-as by it, the talk of the Commissioners will have force, —without it, will be ineffectual, and calculated to inflame the Indians.
My real desire that my friend Gadsden should be successful in his first essay as commissioner, and also that the best interest of Florida should be promoted, has induced me thus to obtrude these ref [MS.
torn] suggestions upon your mind, trusting that they will be read with that spirit of friendship with which they are written."

There can be no doubt, from the representations you have made, that the wreck was fraudulent, and that method adopted to supersede, as was supposed, the necessity of proceedings in a court of Admiralty, to try the question of prize. There is no statute of the United States regulating the disposition of property wrecked on our territory; but the common law contemplates all wrecks as the property of the Sovereign. The proper course will, therefore, be to Send the whole of the property to S' Augustine and have it placed in the custody of the Marshal; carefully preserving all the papers and writings found with the Same, which you will transmit to the Attorney of the U.S.
for East Florida, with a request that he will institute proceedings against the property in the Superior Court of East Florida, on behalf of the United States, founded on the right of the United States to the Said property as wreck, and given notice to all parties interested to appear and interpose their respective claims.
As regards the conduct of Joshua Appleby, detained under arrest, it is not expedient to institute against him any further proceedings;
his offense does not amount to a positive violation of any law of the United States, you will, therefore, direct him to be forthwith liberated.

<docbody>SIR, On the 27" day of August last I received the appointment of Sollicitor for the counties of St John, and Duval in the Territory of Florida, and performed the duties of the office up to the 27" of May last—The legislative Council had at its first session deemed the establishment of inferior Courts necessary; and after having organized a judiciary such as they thought the exigencys of the country required, they passed a law to raise a revenue for the purpose of compensating the officers of the different courts—This last law was on the third of March last disapproved of by congress"—and of course the collection of the revenue has never been made—Tis but fair therefore to presume that as Congress, acted under the impression that the people of this country were unable to bear taxation, it intended that the General government should defray the expences incurred under the law of the legislative council establishing circuit courts in the Territory, as that law was sanctioned by Congress and the courts actually in operation, until the system was altered by the Council, which has just adjourned.
I trust that the executive will think with me, that as Congress has deprived the Territorial government of the means to meet its engagements that those to whom it is indebted have a just claim upon the general government for their demands—Under the impression that the justice and equity of my application will receive due consideration from you, I have taken the liberty to draw for the amount of my account; * and I have the honor to be Yr S"

SIR. Herewith I have the honor to transmit an account of (a part)
of expenditures made by me, for the U.S. p" the Territory of Florida togather with my account for services rendered." In order to defray the expences of the Office of Sheriff, and not having suffitient funds of my own, I was obliged to purchase provisions &c on a Credit to feed the Prisoners &c. The Legislative Council having rejected the nomination you done me the honor to make for my reappointment as Sheriff has injured my credit so much that four suits have been instituted against me on account of the distribution of Territorial Funds to defray the necessary expences of my office, I hope it will be in your power to pay the am" or at least to advance so much as will inable me to pay off about 1000 Doll". My situation is deplorable indeed, I am in a strange country without means and a Family to support and if relief is not soon afforded, what little property I have will be exposed to Sheriff Sale to pay Public expences.

Key West is considered healthy. Your Deputy caught the yellow fever at the Havana, as have all those who have been afflicted with that disease. If he had remained at his post it is highly probable that he would have escaped and continued in health.

<docbody>HONORABLE JOHN QUINCY ADAMS Secretary of State.
Agreeably to our instructions dated 5* Ap' 1823"—we took possession of the eight Boxes of Spanish Documents on the 9" May and continued the examination of them untill the 24" May when it was suspended in consequence of Mr. Reynolds being a Member of the Legislative Council; the Council closed their Session the 5* July and on the 7" we entered again upon our duties—At the request of Mr Hamilton one of the Land Comissioners who arrived here some weeks before his Colleagues we were induced to examine certain Bundles for the purpose of furnishing him with the Royal Orders respecting the granting of Lands should they be found, they were found, and Mr.
Hamilton was permitted to examine them, and at his request gave him Copies of them for the use of the Board, as also Copies to such private individuals as applied for them—Those Copies were certified by Mr. Reynolds as Keeper of the Public Archives. In the course of our further examination we found sundry other Documents which we conceived might be important to the Board of Land Commissioners then in session to have Copies of, we accordingly communicated the fact to one of them, in consequence of which they directed their Secretary to examine them, and make a Schedule of such as he thought might be important in their deliberations:—To their Secretary every facility was given and he made a Schedule of such as he thought proper, which Schedule we presume was by him presented to the
<pb#752 />
Board, as on the next day the following order was presented by their Secretary “Wednesday August 20* 1823. Ordered that the Secretary of this Board, Do call upon William Reynolds, Keeper of the Public Archives for the District of East Florida and require of him the Original Documents in the Schedule marked (A) and numbered from one to 35—inclusive—to be filed in the Office of the Secretary to this Board for the use of said Board, and that the said Secretary do forthwith observe this Order and report to this Board upon tomorrow.
A Copy from the minutes of the Board of Land Commissioners for E. Florida—Attested F. J. Fatio Secy Board of Land Commissioners”—to which the following answer was returned—“St. Augustine August 21" 1823–Sir—In reply to your note of yesterday in which you enclose me Copy of an order passed by the Honorable the Board of Land Commissioners and Schedule of certain Original Documents which they require of me as Keeper of the Public Archives, I beg leave to inform you that the Documents there alluded to, are not in my Office, but are found among the Archives now in possession of Commissioners appointed by the Secretary of State to reexamine them;
as one of the Commission it will afford me pleasure to give the Honorable Board any information contained in them, in the mode we have already done at the request of Mr. Hamilton one of the Honorable the Commissioners, as this course have been approved of by the Gentleman associated with me, and as we are only appointed by the Secretary of State to examine the papers, we could not without an order from the Department of State, part with the Custody of the Original papers, If however our personal attendance should be required by the Honorable Board for the purpose of exhibiting any Original Document in our possession we will most Cheerfully comply—I am respectfully your most obedient Servant—William Reynolds—Keeper of the Public Archives—F. J. Fatio Esquire Secretary of Board of Land Commissioners”—On the following morning we were served with a writ of Judes tecum;" we accordingly repaird to the Board with the Original Documents required in the writ and exhibited them to the Commissioners stating at same time our decided conviction that we had no authority to part with the possession of the Original papers, but that we would give them Copies, or that their Secretary might take Copies of them in our Office, or that we would personally attend at the Board untill their Secretary could take Copies, that there were private individuals who had applied for Copies of some of them and that if taken out of our possession we could not accomodate the Public as the necessity of their cases appeard to require.—Some of them were considered very important in ejectment cases which were expected to come on at the November Term, and that if once taken from us we could not feel ourselves authorized to receive them again into the
<pb#753 />
Office without instructions from the Department to that effect: The Commissioners having them then in their possession were divided on the question of returning them Mr. Blair for, Mr. Hamilton against returning, Mr. Floyd absent, consequently the papers were retained.
The reason of this last objection of ours will be perfectly understood by the following explanation—The Spanish mode of keeping their Archives is as follows An official Letter from the Governor to the Captain Gen. Secretary of State, in fact in all cases was first drafted on a loose Sheet of Paper often much erased and enterlined a fair Copy was made out and forwarded—the Original draft as above described, filed away in the office without any signature—therefore it is only the situation in which it is found among the Archives that can give it any credit as an Official Document, which Character is in a great measure destroyed by its being separated from the Office—
We have thought it our duty to communicate those facts to you, and request you will be pleased to give us such instructions for our future governm" as the nature of the case in your Judgement may require "—
With great respect. We remain yours Most Obedient Servants.

SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27" May, referring to my account, as Superintendent of Indian affairs in this Territory, rendered in to your Department."
The item which I find objected to, is a specific sum of $1500, debited by me for office rent, Clerk hire, and other expenses attending the discharge of the duties of that situation, I have no desire to receive from the Government, any money but what I am justly entitled to, and I am bold to hope, that when the circumstances under which I
have been placed are considered, my demand will not be deemed unreasonable. Altho' my situation materially differs from that of either Governors Clark, Cass, or Miller, yet I can with great confidence assure you that it is, and has been, attended with many peculiar inconveniences from which they were exempt.
Until the arrival of the Agent, last winter, the duty of attending to the Indians devolved on me, the total inability of Cap" Pelham, from
<pb#755 />
his ill health, to do the duty of his office,” and the acting Agent Col. Eustis having been stationed at S* Augustin, precluded the possibility of my receiving any assistance from either of these Gentlemen, in the Western part of the Territory. The fever which prevailed at Pensacola last season, obliged me to leave that place, and owing to the illness of the Secretary Col. Walton's and his family, I found it necessary to employ Alfred W Hines, as a Clerk, to whom I paid several sums of money for his services, as well as his board. I perceive you are misinformed as regards the number of the Florida Indians, and their intercourse with this City, they are scattered over the greatest part of the Territory, and since my arrival here not a day has passed in which several have not been in town, they are constantly coming and going, and almost always call on me. the Spanish Governors invariably treated them with great respect and ceremony, as they dreaded giving them the slightest offence, and I deem it prudent not to make any change in this intercourse until after the treaty. Many of these Indians possess considerable property, and as licences to trade had before my arrival been given to every person who applied and offered Security, various disputes have arisen between the Indians and those traders, which occupy my attention daily, and as I feel it my duty, to have the strictest justice done in these cases, much of my time and attention is occupied in their investigation. In order to hear the talks of the Indians, and transact the business connected with them, I have been obliged to rent an office with a large Room, but after October next, I do not believe I
shall be under an absolute necessity of renting a house for this purpose.
Under the impression (however erroneous) that the sum of 1500
Dollars would be allowed me to cover the expenses of Office Rent, fuel, stationary, Clerk hire, &cc I never kept an Account of my actual expenditure, except that of the sums received from your department, and cannot consequently certify the exact amount on my honour.
You are now informed that Thomas Murphy has acted as my clerk from the 1* May to 1* Sept'. I employed him without agreeing to pay any certain sum, but his compensation was to be submitted to your discretion, he has performed much service, and as yet has received nothing, the expense of living is high, and a Clerk cannot obtain decent boarding in this City, for less than from 7 to 10 Dollars per week. I will only remark that after October, I shall endeavor to do all the writing myself, and will save (as far as I can do so without neglecting my other duties) your department from every expense that can be avoided, consistent with the public interest.

Governor Harrison * of the former territory of Indiana, and Governor Edwards” of Illinois, must I presume have been somewhat similarly circumstanced with myself. I am ignorant of what they received as Superentend" of Indian affairs, but I conceive myself justly entitled, to the same compensation, which can be ascertained by reference to the allowance made them.
Were I disposed to look for any thing more than what I am fairly entitled to, I am satisfied the order, regularity, and Economy of your department, would prevent such an expectation from being realized, for the same reason I look with confidence to such an allowance as has been usually made in similar cases, and at once submit my claim to your judgment and decision. I also beg leave to request that you will fix upon a specific sum for my future allowance, in order that I may make arrangements suitable to it.” With the highest respect I have the honor to be Sir Your most ob" Serv"

<docbody>SIR On the 11" February last I had the honour of addressing a letter to you on the subject of our City debts,” contracted in the years
1821 and 2—and requesting that the President would be pleased to authorise their payment: Under date of first march you replied,” that
“the amount would be paid from the fund appropriated by the act of Congress of 3" March 1821—for carrying into execution the Treaty between the United States and Spain, so far as the expenditures shall upon the examination of the accounts for the same appear to have been just and reasonable”—On the 15* April last I wrote to you enclosing the accounts referred to,” amounting to $2478 61%/100 since which I have not been favored with any communication on the subject.
Many of the claimants are much in want of their money; and since May last have been anxiously looking for the payment of their demands: Many of the original crediters of the Corporation, have transferred their accounts; and a house in Charlston now holds upwards of One Thousand dollars of these claims, altho’ the accounts forwarded to your department, are in the names of the original crediters, and the transfers not noted.
On the arrival of every Mail, numbers are calling on me to enquire if money has been received to pay their demands—I cannot imagine that anything should have occurred to induce the President to change his opinion as to the payment of these claims—
I have to request as a particular favour, that you will be pleased to give this an early consideration, and should it be determined to remit the amount, that it may be done by a Draft on the U.S. Branch Bank at Charlston, as a draft on that place, can be cashed here with-

<docbody>CAPT. D. E. BURCH Asst. Q Master Pensacola SIR, So soon as the season shall permit, you will commence the survey of a road, on the most direct practicable route, from Pensacola in West Florida, to St. Augustine in East Florida.
Previous to commencing the survey, you will examine, or cause to be examined, the country between yellow Water" & St. Rosa's” bay, and if it be sufficiently high & dry, to admit of a good road, that route would be preferable to that which you recommend by Beeler's ferry—
the convenience for crossing the Bay at the town of Pensacola, it is believed, will be greater, and the ferriage in consequence, more certain than at Beelers: besides, some distance will be saved, and Cold water bay and Yellow water river, as well as Beeler's ferry, will be avoided.
Should this route be found practicable, it might intersect that proposed by you at, or near, the ferry on Choctaw Hatchie.” It is believed that the route proposed by you thence to Ochessee, on the Appalachicola, is preferable to any other. From the Appalachicola to St.
Augustine, you must endeavour to make the road as short and direct as the nature of the country will permit.—The route must be marked by cutting, or, as it is called in the Western Country, blazing trees at convenient distances, so that the Troops ordered to open the road, may trace the route without the aid of a guide.
The commanding officer at Pensacola will be instructed, by an order from the Adjutant General's Office, to place under your command, a subaltern officer & such number of non com" officers & soldiers as may be found necessary. You will employ guides, & provide the number of horses, mules, tools & instruments, which the service may require. Having completed the survey, you will make to this office, a detailed report of your proceedings, as soon as you possibly can, taking care to note particulary the nature of the country, the quality
<pb#759 />
of the lands, the number & condition of the Indians, in the vicinity of the proposed road, the nature of the ferries or fords over the several rivers, or other waters on the route; and every other circumstance which you may consider of sufficient interest to be known. You will also report, whether in your opinion, it may not be necessary to station small detachments of troops, at convenient distances on the road, until the country be settled, to afford protection to travellers, as well as to the mail; and to facilitate the communication between the two territories.—
You will also, make a detailed estimate of the probable sum required to open the road, & forward it to this office. I return to you the map which you sent to me on which I have marked — — — — the route proposed between Yellow Water & St. Rosa's bay.”
When you shall have completed the survey of, the road to St.
Augustine,” and have forwarded your report and estimate, you will then survey the mail route which you proposed between Pensacola and Fort Mitchell, and make a similar report & estimate.”

<place-time>PENSACOLA 12" September 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I received your letter by the last Mail requesting me to forward my account for services as District Atto of West Florida to you for adjustment.” I have already forwarded them several months since to the other department, upon the subject of which they have not favoured me with any answer. I am gratified to learn that they are to be adjusted at the Department of State. I was appointed by the Judge of the Superior Court to attend to the interests of the United States at a period when the Court was crowded with important business of the Government, and at a time when no Attorney had been appointed to fill the vacancy of the late incumbent. I was offered a much larger sum to appear for the Defendants than that charged to the United States. In the first account I forwarded to the other Department, I charged the sum of ten Dollars for each prisoner or Defendant tried in Court. We have no fee fixed by law for the prosecution of offenders in this Territory, and upon reference to the Act of Congress fixing the compensation of Attorneys, I find they are allowed as in the Courts of the State in which the prosecution is
<pb#760 />
carried on, and if there is none allowed by the laws of that State, then those of the nearest District. I have now made out my account charging fifteen dollars, being the fee in criminal cases in Alabama, and I am informed by the District Attorney there that that sum has always been paid to him, and in cases of Piracy an additional compensation allowed: all that I demand is what the law allows me. Shortly after my appointment some of the most valuable public buildings were taken possession of by British Grantees—I prosecuted writs of Forcible Entry & Detainer against them in the County and Circuit Court of the Territory, at great trouble and labor, until they were evicted, and the houses redelivered, by the Sheriff, to the Quarter Master and are now in the possession of the United States.
I consider the account, herewith enclosed, a just and legal statement of what I am entitled to, which I will thank you to submit, as early as possible, to the Hon. Secretary, and the amount, or whatever portion thereof, may be allowed, I will thank you to remit in a Check upon the Branch Bank of New-Orleans, or give me authority to draw upon you, on the Bank at Washington, whichever may be most convenient to you.”

[Enclosure:LS]
Alexander Scott, Jr. to Judge Brackenridge Collectors Office PENSACOLA 2" Sept. 1823
SIR Herewith I have the honor to transmit a copy of a note addressed by me to W* F. Steele Esqr. U. S. attorney of W. Florida requesting him to institute suit against James Forsyth Master of the Schooner Thomas Shields of & from New Orleans for having landed Slaves at this port contrary to the provisions of the 9* Section of the Act of Congress passed March 2" 1807. for the Suppression of the Slave trade.”
It appears from M* Steeles reply (a copy of which is also enclosed)
that such offences cannot be prosecuted in the name of the U. States, an opinion in which I imagine few Legal men will concur, The Security of the Revenue in its collection as also the preventing the illegal introduction of Slaves (in relation to which the most benevolent means have been adopted by the Section alluded to in imposing a penalty of $10.000. on the master of the Wessels who violates it)
depending entirely upon a Salutary & rigid enforcement of the Laws, when they are enfringed wilfully & with intent to defraud & as such cases may daily occur, I consder it a duty imperatively incumbent upon me as the Deputy Collector of this port to insist that an Attorney be appointed pro tem by the court to prosecute all suits arising from infractions of the Revenue Laws & those relating to the Slave trade.
If the doctrine of M* Steele is admitted the Laws may be violated with impunity, & the refusal on the part of the District Attorney to act I consider equally as great a disqualification, as death, disability or absence, in all of which cases the Court exercizes the prerogative of appointing a successor.

$20 for appearing as counsel in the case of M. Simon W. S. Alexander Scott Collector which is now on the Docket.
By a reference to the bill filed in the case it will be found that this suit originated in consequence of the seizure of a certain number of casks teneriffe wine by the Collector through his Deputy; being the original casks of importation and were not accompanied by the necessary Certificates of legal importation prescribed by the 23" & 26* Sections of the Act of Congress passed March 3” 1799.” it is to be inferred from his making the demand, that as in the other Case, he views this as a qui tam action.

SIR I have rec" your letter of 4* Ins'" relative to the conduct of the Master of the Steam Schooner, which plies betwen this place and your port, in landing Slaves, transported in said Wessel without a Slave Manifest or descriptive list, & landing them without a permit or Inspection.
In answer to your request, I have to inform you that I have always considered the law as imperative, & in every instance where it has been violated, I have felt it my duty to institute a prosecution—and where Circumstances justify it, the libel can be dismissed with the consent of the Court & Att° for the U. States—It appears to me that the Master of the Schooner in question, is determined to ascertain whether he will be permitted to violate the laws with impunity or not, a few days past he brough two Slaves into this District, unacompanied with a Slave Manifest & landed them without a permit, the consequence was, that I libelled his Wessel—if the practice was permitted to be continued, we should soon have Africans in abundance into this State I am very Respectfully Sir your mo. obt.

<docbody>SIR, The Citizens of this Territory and of the neighbouring States have many fugitive Slaves running at large in the Southern part of this paninsula, and I am obliged to request of you to make application to the President of the United States for a sufficient force to have them apprehended.
I have received information, that a considerable number of these Slaves have established themselves on Pine Island at the mouth of Charlotte river, & are well armed with Spanish Muskets &cc, & that they refuse to permit any American to visit the Island. The Indians state that some Spaniards are with them who have several small vessels carrying from one to three Guns each & that these Negroes are employed in cutting timber on the Island, and in fishing for the Havanna market. The owners of these Slaves continually solicit me to send a force to take them, but I am unable to comply with their wishes, as I cannot call out the Militia without an order to that effect, nor have I the means of arming or obtaining rations for those who might be employed. If the President would permit me to call out fifty or sixty of the mounted Militia, to be placed under the command of the Indian Agent, Col. Humphreys, who should also be empowered to take with him such Indian force as may be deemed necessary, these slaves can be apprehended; there must be several hundred of them in Florida. I hope the President and yourself will at once perceive the importance of authorizing me to act speedily in arresting the refugee Slaves at Pine Island, and elsewhere in this Territory.
As the Agent Col' Humphreys will hand you this letter, I refer you to him for such other information on this Subject as you may desire to obtain; & all the arrangements which the Government may deem
<pb#767 />
proper in order to carry into effect the objects of this communication may be made with him. I have the utmost confidence in Col Humphreys & assure you that he is an active, and energetic Agent, possesses a great command over the Indians, & has rendered his Country during the late Treaty the most valuable services.
I have been been informed by Gentlemen upon whom I can rely, that there are about ninety negros, fugitives from this Province and the neighbouring States, on St Andrews Island one of the Bahamas, &
about thirty more on the Great Bahama & the neighbouring Islands, those Negros went from Tampa Bay, & Charlotte Harbour, in boats to the Florida Keys from whence they were taken to the Bahamas by the Providence Wreckers, The slaves might be obtained, if Com. Porter be ordered to demand them from the authorities at those Islands."

<docbody>HON” JoHN. C. CALHOUN Secretary of War SIR. The necessity of the Agent of Indian Affairs, speedily making his establishment, and taking up his residence in the Country allotted to the Florida Indians, will readily occur to you. I am unacquainted
<pb#769 />
with the usual practice of your Department as to the provision made in such cases.
The buildings actually required for the Agency will I suppose be provided for, as it is obvious that the Salary allowed the Agent will not allow him to meet this expense.
By the treaty, the Florida Indians are to be furnished with rations of Corn, Meat, & Salt, for the Hative; for one year from the first of Febr' next; if beef be furnished, with Corn, & Salt the ration will I am satisfied not cost more than from 12 to 14 Cents, and perhaps somewhat less; the Corn if bought at New Orleans, & shipped to Tampa Bay, will not there stand more than 40 Cents a Bushel, & beef can be purchased on foot at from 6 to 8 Dollars the hundred weight, & driven into the Indian Country. If this course be pursued the expense will be greatly diminished. These remarks are respectfully submitted for your Consideration.”

<docbody>SIR. On the 21" instant you were advised by mail of our having concluded a Treaty with the Florida Tribes of Indians *—The 2"
No reply found. See post, p. 752.
<pb#770 />
Article of the Treaty, accompanying this will inform you of the Boundaries assigned them, which with the other articles agreed on will be found in our opinion to correspond with the spirit of our instructions, as well as the humane policy of our government—The want of a knowledge of the Country South of Charlotts' Harbor, and the impossibility of inducing competent individuals to explore, or of obtaining any satisfactory information relative to that region, necessarily prohibited the Commissioners from confining the Indians to that quarter agreeably to the views of the Executive as first expressed n our instructions-A Northern Location, though desired by a Majority of the Indians, was violently opposed within the limits recommended by Gen' Jackson; to have extended beyond those limits would have been injurious to the best interests of Florida-A Southern location was objected to by the Indians on the ground that the Country South of Tampa did not contain a sufficient quantity of good land to furnish the subsistence of life—That force only could drive them into whole Territory of Florida except a large reservation, to which the Indians were to be removed, and a half dozen small tracts reserved to six of the principal chiefs who were to be allowed to remain thereon with their connections. For the boundaries of the reservation lying in the heart of the peninsula east of Tampa Bay, and the chiefs’ reserves, see Charles C. Royce, Indian Land Cessions in U. S. (Bureau Amer. Ethnology, 18 Annual Rept., pt. 2), plate 14, cession desig.
118, 119, 176, 184, 185.
The journal of the proceedings, which embodies also a number of relevant documents for the period Apr. 7-Sept. 26, 1823, is in NA (OIA, Treaties, Talks, and Councils), and is printed, A.S.P., Indian Affairs, II, 431–441. The documents in question anent the treaty, not otherwise printed or cited in the present volume, are as follows: the Secretary of War to Gadsden, July 31, 1823 (ibid., p. 436), that if the Indians are unwilling to concentrate south of Tampa Bay, the alternative would be the Appalachicola, as suggested by Jackson; DuVal to George Murray, July 29, 1823 (ibid., p. 435), that Murray has been appointed secretary to the Indian commissioners, and that he was expected to mark out the spot for the treaty meeting and to attend to other necessary arrangements; id. to Lt.
Brown, assistant commissary, July 31 and Aug. 28, 1823 (ibid., pp. 435–436,437), relative to rations for the Indians; id. to Capt J. Erwing, Aug. 26 and Aug. 27, 1823 (ibid., pp. 436, 436–437), concerning a military guard for the conference;
Gadsden to the Secretary of War, July 29, 1823 (ibid., p. 435), that Agent Humphreys had reached St. Marks and would assemble the Indians to the treaty grounds; id. to Richards (interpreter), June 7 and June 9, 1823 (ibid., p. 433), that the commissioners expect him and Humphreys to assemble the Indians from west of the Suwanee; id. to Humphreys, June 6, 1823 (ibid., p. 432), that Sept. 5
had been agreed upon with the Seminole chiefs for the conference and Humphreys is requested to make all arrangements for the attendance of the Indians; Humphreys to Gadsden, July 3, 1823 (ibid., p. 435), that the chiefs of the Seminoles west of the Suwanee would be informed of the Sept. 5 meeting; Capt. J. Erving to DuVal, Aug. 27, 1823 (2 letters, ibid., pp. 436, 437), that a guard would be provided for the treaty conference; talks at the conference, Sept. 6, Sept. 10, and Sept. 11, 1823 (ibid., pp. 437-439). In addition, see DuVal to the Secretary of War, Sept. 1, 1823 (NA, OIA, SW Lets. Recd.), that Humphreys had arrived at St. Augustine Aug. 20 with 850 chiefs and warriors.
<pb#771 />
those limits, and that they were well convinced that the Americans possessed the power, and they not the ability to resist—The Indians therefore threw themselves on the protection of the U States; and appealed feelingly to the humanity of the Commissioners not to locate them in a country in which they must inevitably starve—We knew nothing of the Country but from vague, and contradictory representations; the appeal therefore was listened to so far as to embrace within the limits assigned the Indians a small tract of Country about 30 miles north of Tampa Bay, containing within its boundaries many of the Settlements of the Southern Chiefs—Even this extension North was not considered as removing the objections urged; to satisfy therefore all parties and convince even the Indians of the humane disposition of the American government towards them, an article was incerted that if on examination by the Commissioners &c appointed to run the line it should appear that there was not a sufficient quantity of good land within the limits allotted them, then the North line should be extended so as to give satisfaction on this point—
The reservations made in the Appalachicola district were in favor of six influential Chiefs, whose assent to the Treaty could not have been obtained without this equitable provision for them & their connections—They are all represented to be men of industrious habits, and who have made some advances in civilization—Blunt & Tuske-Hajo have been long friendly to the Americans, and rendered essential services to Gen' Jackson during the operations in Florida, on the termination of which they were permitted to reside where they now do under the protection of the United States, with a promise that when the Indians in Florida were disposed of, the provisions now made for them should be taken into consideration—We view these reservations as among the most favourable terms of the Treaty; The lands allotted each Chief & their connections are so limited, as to force the occupants into the civil habits and pursuits; while so large a subtraction is made from the Indian population to be concentrated, as to render that population more easily manageable The Treaty however was the best we could effect and we are inclined to the opinion that the boundaries to which the Indians have been limited will be found, on reflection, to be the most judicious in a National, as well as Territorial point of view—Justice has been done to the Indians by assigning to them a sufficient quantity of tillable land, with the addition of an extent of Territory alike favourable as hunting grounds, and for the grazing of Cattle; while the position is so central as to admit of being encircled by a white population capable of overawing and controlling their uncivilized propensities—
We deem it our duty before closing our mission to invite your attention to some important subjects as intimately connected with the
<pb#772 />
accomplishment of the views which have dictated the policy pursued by the U States towards the Indians—It was a misfortune to Florida as a frontier Territory and with her maritime exposure to have any Tribes of Indians within her boundaries—It would have been a National benefit to have removed them to a more interior position; but as this seems to have been impracticable; the only course left was that which has been adopted—The Confining the Indians within certain limits, and in that part of the Territory least objectionable—This being accomplished it is indispensable for the benefit of the Indians;
as well as the future security of Florida that all intercourse with foreign Countries or Individuals exercising an influence over them be cut off, and that an exclusive control be obtained and maintained by the American Government—This is only to be effected by the immediate establishment of Military posts at the Bay of Tampa, Charlotts Harbor, and at some other point near Cape Florida on the Eastern Coast, with such other salutary laws regulating the Trade with them as your own sound judgement may dictate-It is scarcely necessary to state to you that a Majority of the Indians now inhabiting the Territory of Florida and included as parties to the treaty just effected, are wanderers, if not Refugees from the Southern Indians—Many of them are of the old Red Stick party whose feelings of hostility have only been suppressed not eradicated, and even the Native Seminoles have ever been of a most erratic disposition—These Indians are now scattered over the whole face of Florida, but a small portion of them having any settled residence; a majority wandering about for such a precarious subsistence as the esculent roots of the woods, or the misfortunes of our Navigators on the Florida Keys may afford-
To bring together these discordant and fermenting materials; to embody such a population within prescribed limits, afnd] to conquer their erratic habits will require in some degree the exercise of authority, with the presence of a military establishment adequate to enforce it—
These Posts therefore, in our opinion, should be established before the boundary line is run and marked—Such a military disposition of an adequate force would produce an impression upon the Indians most favourable to an immediate concentration within the limits allotted—
The Military establishments recommended from the protection they would afford, will further induce an early settlement of the country now open to the enterprise of emigrants; the presence of which population will assist materially in forcing the Indians within the limits allotted them & in obtaining that control so much desired-
As an act of justice to Lt Ripley who commanded the detachment of Troops on the Treaty ground; & of Lt H Brown the Asst Commissary of Subsistence we most cheerfully testify to the Zealous, active faithful discharge of the various duties assigned them -
<pb#773 />
Col Humphreys Indian Agent, & Mr Richards the Interpreter likewise rendered us essential services during the complicated difficulties we had to encounter-In assembling and marching the Western Indians through a Wilderness of 250 miles in extent to the Treaty ground, they have been exposed to privations & expenses giving them strong claims on the Department of War for extra compensation; the equitable adjustment of which is submited to your consideration * by Your Most obt Servants Wm P DUVAL

<docbody>SIR. Governor Duval has requested me to consent to act as one of the Commissioners provided for to run the boundary line as concluded on by the late Treaty with the Florida Indians—I have said to him that I would so far comply with his wishes as to write a private letter to you explaining my views on the subject, and stating how far my services may be demanded if required by the Executive—The situation of Commissioner adverted to, is not to be coveted, but I am willing to act in said capacity provided in so doing I can be instrumental to the immediate accomplishment of the objects to be effected by the Treaty lately concluded with the Florida Indians, and render any service to the Territory of Florida—The boundary line of the Country South allotted to the Indians can only be run at a certain season of the year, & if that season is permitted to escape a postponement to a subsequent one is inevitable—This Season: is confined to the winter months or between the 1* of Jan’ & 1 of April—The reservations on the Appalachicola may be laid off at most any season, but the most favourable would be the months of November or December—The sooner the line of demarkation is defined, the sooner will the Indians concentrate, and any delay on the part of the U States may produce an opinion among the Indians that the National Government is not determined on an object of vital importance to the prosperity of Florida—It is not necessary to disguise the fact to you, that the treaty effected was in a degree a treaty of imposition—The Indians would never have voluntarily assented to the terms had they not believed that we had both the power & disposition to compel obedience-
The Impression made therefore should not be lost; a military Post should be immediately established at the Bay of Tampa, & the boundary line commenced & run as soon as the season will permit—Should the Executive therefore concur in opinion with me on the above view taken of this subject & is willing to act conformable to that view—I
have no objections to make an effort to be useful in the Capacity of Commissioner—
It is natural to wish to succeed in what we undertake:—Success would be doubtful if the Commissioner was unsupported at least with the presence of a Military force within striking distance of his operations; & failure inevitable if he attempts to contend against the elements—
From all the information I can gather relating to the country allotted the Indians, the hunting grounds in particular are innundated during the spring & summer rains—It is in winter only that they can be traversed, it is at that season only that they can be penetrated with comfort & without sacrifices of health—I am willing therefore to
<pb#775 />
act as Commissioner, provided I can be immediately appointed & can receive the necessary orders for the immediate execution of the duties as such—In this event I should proceed directly to the Appalachicola, & survey the reservations made in that district—This could be accomplished by the time you would be prepared to send a garrison to the Bay of Tampa, with which I could move & commence my labors South—
Should the above view of this subject correspond with your own;
& my services be required; & the Executive feel disposed to associate any one with me; I take the liberty to name to you Lt James Ripley of the Army; with the remark that his appointment would be gratifying in the extreme to me—Lt Ripley commanded the Guard on the Treaty ground & rendered the Commissioners essential services during the complicated duties of their mission He possesses the qualifications necessary in a preeminent degree—The only objections to the propositions submitted anticipated by me, are the possible unwillingness of the Executive to act before the ratification of the Treaty—But may not this obstacle be obviated on the plea of policy or necessity—If the running of the line is postponed untill the Treaty is ratified it is very problematical whether it can then be run this season—To delay concentrating the Indians another year would be seriously felt in the Territory of Florida—It would be subjecting her fate to another embarrassment & she has already labored under many—The expense I hope will prove no objection for I should be willing (if necessary) to make no demands on the Treasury untill advised of an appropriation; advancing the requisite amounts myself—The plan which I would submit for the execution of the duties of Commissioner would involve very little expense comparatively—The Commissioner or Commissioners to receive from the Dep" of War an order to the Commanding Officers at S*Marks & at the Bay of Tampa to furnish such facilities as their commands would afford—From the former the men necessary to run the lines of the reservations might be furnished; & from the latter the men & (guard if found necessary)
to run the line South—A Surveyor I would not require but would prefer the selecting a Subaltern officer from those Posts or Pensacola, to receive an extra compensation for his services—Or if you would prefer it a Lt of Engineers might be detailed as Surveyor, this latter arrangement would be more agreeable to me & if equally so to you I would mention the name of Lt Ogden * who is now at Mobile Point;
The expenses of the Commission would therefore be small & confined to the pay of Commissioners: Pay to Indian accompanying Commissioners, Extra to officer acting as Surveyor; & men acting as assistants in carrying chain & instruments, Pack Horses; and Contingencies
<pb#776 />
Accompanying this you will receive a map with the Country allotted to the Indians delineated "–Little confidence is to be placed on the accuracy of Vignole's map *—as to the Interior of the Country;
the Sea Coast may be correct as he had resort to some of the best English & Spanish Charts—The interior of Florida has never been explored. that I can ascertain—Vignoles made but a short excursion into the Country West of St Augustine—He never was more than 20
miles South of Alachua—The position of Okahumky & other Indian villages as laid down by him is grossly erroneous—this error has been corrected in the map sent you I shall leave this for Charleston S* C in a few days with an intention of returning immediately to this place—I shall remain in that City however for an answer to this letter,” as should my services be wanted as Commissioner my destination would in some measure be changed—

SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of an order from the Department dated the 4* Sep 1823." signed Daniel Brent Chief Clk. in which I am required “to deliver over to the Board of Commissioners at St. Augustine for ascertaining claims and titles to Lands in Florida the public Documents transfered by Gov” Coppinger to the American Comm” at the cession of East Florida to the U.S.” as it is well known that I have no Documents of that kind, and that those under my charge are part of those taken from Gov” Coppinger and D" Juan de Entralgo the Public Notary on the [blank] Sep 1821 by virtue of an order from General A. Jackson then Governor of this Territory. Presuming it might have been intended to refer to them, and being desirous to act in this affair so as to meet the approvation of the Government, and knowing that a delivery of those papers would be very injurious to the inhabitants of this Territory as it would prevent them from obtaining Copies of their titles to Land and prevent them from going into the trial of many cases at the Nov. Term.
I thought it the most prudent and correct course to submit the affair to the consideration of M" Macon the United States District Attorney which I did in the following letter Marked A When Mr. Macon called at my office I explained the nature of the different Documents and shew him the impossibility of separating the papers relating to Land claims without cutting the Books and thereby distroying many other Documents such as powers of Att’ mortgages, Bills of Sales, Protests, Wills &c. and also that a delivery of the whole would place in the hands of the Land Com” more than 100.000. different Documents which have no relation to lands whatever. On the day following I
received from Mr. Macon the reply marked B. and in consequence of the opinion therein expressed, coinciding with my own as well as that of many other inteligent Gentlemen of the place and more particularly as Judge Blair (one of the two only Commissioners now present)
has given it as his opinion that it would be depriving the inhabitants of the means of obtaining copies of Sundry Documents interesting to them, and would place in the possession of the Board a very great many papers entirely useless and which have no relation to Lands, I
have determined to keep possession of the Documents untill further instructed by the Department which I communicated to the Board in the following letter marked C. I have therefore to request that you will furnish me with such instructions" on this subject as may
<pb#778 />
appear necessary and proper to enable me to conduct the Office in such a manner as to give satisfaction to the Gen' Government as well as the inhabitants of the Territory.—

EDGAR MACON Esquire U. S. D. Attorney for E. Florida.
SIR, I this day received the following communication from the Department of State. “The Keeper of the Public Archives at S*
Augustine, Department of State Washington 4* September 1823, Sir, In the absence of the Secretary of State, I am directed by the President of the United States to request you to deliver over to the Board of Commissioners, at S*Augustine, for ascertaining claims and titles to Land in Florida, the Public documents transfered by Governor Coppinger to the American Commissioner, at the cession of East Florida, to the United States; which documents are stated to be now in your custody, I am respectfully, Sir, Your obedient & humble Servant Daniel Brent, Chief Clerk” *—By the terms of the above order you will perceive that I have not a single document in my possession of the kind therein described. The documents under my charge as Keeper of the Public Archives are some of those taken from Don Juan de Entralgo and Don José Coppinger (chiefly from the former) on the [blank] September 1821., by virtue of an order from General Andrew Jackson, then Governor of the Territory of Florida.
Mr Hamilton one of The Honorable The Board of Land Commissioners, is however of opinion that the order embraces all the Archives in my Office.—I am of a different opinion; and as I am extremely desirous to conduct the business of the office in such a manner as will give entire satisfaction to the general Goverment, as well as to the Governor of this Territory and its inhabitants, I have to request that you will call at my Office and examine into the nature of the documents, and the manner in which they were kept by the Spanish Government, and give your opinion in writing as the United States District Attorney, whether it would be consistent with Public interest to deliver over the Archives in my office to the Honorable Board of Land Commissioners, or whether it would be proper to separate them
<pb#779 />
and diliver over any part of them; with the understanding that the Honorable Board and Secretary have now and always have had, free and uncontroul’d access to the Original documents in my office, and that I have furnished copies when required to do so.—
I remain with great respect, Sir, Your Obedient Servant.—

Statement of Edgar Macon as District Attorney (East Florida District)
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE September 29, 1823.
At the request of the keeper of publick Archieves of East Florida, I have examined his office and feel no hesitation in saying that a surrender of the papers in his possession will be attended with much inconvenience and detriment to the inhabitants and persons holding or claiming property in this territory. Those accustomed to the regularity of American offices, can form no conception of the manner in which Spanish offices are kept; their proceedings and records are huddled together without any regard to order or system, for a bill of sale, mortgage and power of Attorney, though totally unconnected, are sometimes recorded upon the same sheet of paper; and at the end of the year all papers relating to that year, no matter of what nature, are bound up into a volume, though it has not unfrequently happened that in many instances the publick documents have not received this attention Should the keeper of the publick Archieves place them in the hands of any person, I cannot conceive how many suits can progress, especially where they relate to personal property, or where powers of Attorney are called in question; in as much as the person into whose hands they may come, cannot give certified copies of them, and that such copies if given, would not be received as evidence in a court.
Every person who will take the trouble to inspect the archives of East Florida, must say that a seperation of the papers relating to land from the papers connected with personal property, without a destruction of all written evidence of right of property in East Florida is totally impracticable.
EDGAR MACON District Attorney of E. Florida As an individual, it is but justice to Mr Reynolds, that I should state, that his office has at all times been open to the land comissioners and their secretary, and that he has afforded them every assistance.
Edgar Macon.

<docbody>SIR In addition to my remarks on the subject of the Archives I
beg leave to state that by the third section of the Act of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Flor" passed on the 31* of August 1822
entitled an “Act for the appointment of keepers of the Public Archives,”* by virtue of which I recd my commission, and which “Act”
has been approved of by Congress, I conceive I can not consistently with my duty and Oath of Office, part with the possession of any original Document which was deliver,d to me at the time I took possession of the Office–The words of the Law are “That it shall not be lawful for the said keepers of the Public Archives to suffer any Original Document to be taken from their Offices, unless otherwise required by law, nor to alter or destroy the same”—This opinion is however submited with great deference—believing as I do that it is not the wish of a majority of the Commissioners to take possession of
<pb#781 />
papers when it is so self evident that great injury must result therefrom to the inhabitants of this province, and their having had free &
uncontrould access to the Originals, which access I felt myself bound give them, & which is still continued to them—
I would therefore respectfully suggest (as I am a young (public)
officer and extremely desirous to acquit my self to the entire satisfaction of Government) should there remain any doubt after having heard the opinion of Judge Blair & M" Macon that the opinion of Judge Floyd (the absent Commissioner) should be given on his return after he has examined the nature of the Documents in my Office &
the manner in which they have been kept—

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY BY LOT-HOLDERS OF ST. AUGUSTINE</dochead>
<source>[NA:GLO, PLC, East Fla. Repts.: DS "]</source>
<place-time>[September 1823]</place-time>
<docbody>TO THE HONORABLE WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD Secretary of the Treasury The Memorial of the Subscribers Lot-holders of the City of S'
Augustine humbly Sheweth-
That your Memorialist in common with the holders of Land in the country have been Suffering great difficulties hardships and embarassments for two years in consequence of the protracted and undetermined condition of the claims of the United States to lands in this territory—
Thus Situated, Your Memorialists trust it will not be deemed unreasonable thay they represent to your department their full conviction that neither the interest nor policy of the United States require a determination of the land claims in any other mode than such as is consistent with equity economy Simplicity and dispatch-
Of the lots in S*Augustine to which this Memorial has exclusive reference, that part belonging to the United States was officially designated and a Schedule thereof dilivered by the Spanish Authorities to those of the United States and to this Schedule your Memorialist humbly beg your reference as being ample and Sufficient evidence of the extent of public property within the limits of this City-
<pb#782 />
The lots of private property are upwards of Three hundred in number and have passed thro chains of title, Some commencing in the Seventeenth Century and the greater part early in the Eighteenth Century and these chains or deraignment of title are not only on record, but the facts of descent, conveyance and Occupancy are Matter of great public Notoriety—
Your Memorialists further represent that they are fearful [that the late act of Congress prescribing the mode of ascertaining]" land claims may be so construed as to make it necessary that the lot-holders of S” Augustine Should furnish the Commissioners with Copies of the deraignment of title, and your Memorialists beg leave to urge on you the inexpediency of such a construction from the following considerations—
First Copies of all the titles to lots in St Augustine Would appear to be unnecessary because they are already on record in the public Archives—
Secondly The lot-holders would not only be put to great inconvenience from delay, but Many of them are absolutely unable to pay the expence attendant on the copying of such voluminous documents—
Thirdly Such a construction of the Law would have the effect of retarding the public business and operating to the ruin of many individuals who have already Suffered so Severely from delay—
and lastly If by inadvertence or otherwise the Official Schedule referred to Should be defective, in omitting any public property Such defect your Memorialists humbly Submit to be of comparative insignificance and can be remedied either by the personal Knowledge of the land commissioners or by a few hours enquiry—
Under these considerations your Memorialists pray that you will be pleased to instruct the land commissioners or otherwise Act in the premises so that the lot-holders of S*Augustine may be releived from the expence and inconvenience and the public from the delay attendant on Such a construction of the law—

<dochead>PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT BY INHABITANTS OF THE TERRITORY</dochead>
<source>[NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., C248:DS]</source>
<place-time>St AUGUSTINE Octr 4th 1823</place-time>
<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
The petitioners whoes names are underwritten, beg leave to represent, that the Territory of Florida, whilst it was a possession of foreign nations, was a refuge, for fugitive slaves from, the United States, and particularly from the States of South Carolina and Georgia. That property of this description, has at various times and to great amounts been allured from the possession of its rightful owners; or escaping voluntarily, has been protected & defended not only by the Indians, 
<pb#785 />
but by the Constituted authorities of the province; so that from the date of the Revolution up to the Change of Flags, it has been utterly impossible for your petitioners, and other Sufferers, to reclaim their property.—We beg leave also to represent, that since the latter event, notwithstanding the difficulty of exploreing the Country, many of the Claimants have succeeded in ascertaining, where their Negroes are to be found; that some of them are claimed to be the property of Indians;
some are still in a state of freedom in the Indian Territory, and are protected, by the regulations, made to restrain the intercourse of the Whites with that People, –Some have escaped to an Island or Cluster of Islands off the Western Coast of Florida, & are protected by an armed Banditti: Others have been carried, by Wrecking Wessels from the Cape & keys to the Bahamia Isles.
Your petitioners know not the number of all, or either of these detachments, but have much reason to believe, they amount to more than One Thousand—Your petitioners (some of whom have been deprived of the use of their property, ever Since the War of the Revolution) in Common with the numerous Class of Sufferers in the States before alluded to, looked, with Great anxiety to the acquisition of this Territory, as a period to their privations, but were bitterly disappointed, when their hopes were postponed to a time, infuturo &
uncertain when a treaty should be held with the Indians.—
That period has arrived and elapsed, without bringing with it any redress for our long Continued wrongs, the Commissioners not having any authority, to make or execute any arrangement on the Subject:
so that, whilst the Law furnishes to the Indians ample means of redress for the aggressions of Whitemen, we are Constrained to look on with patience, whilst they possess and enjoy the property, justly and rightfully Ours;—And still it is held obnoxious to law, and improper, to take from their Territory, even those negroes, that are unclaimed and unpossed by the Indians; and this too at a time, when there is much reason for believeing that they are gradually escapeing from the Continent; or, alarmed at the Change of Government, are putting themselves under the protection of individual Indians, who claim them as their private property merely to protect them from their rightful owners.
To arrest these inconveniences, Your petitioners appeal directly, to the Chief Executive of the United States, with a confident belief that he will exert his ample power, to restore them to their long defered rights. To this end they beg leave to suggest to Your Excellency, the investiture of ample discretionary power, in the Governor of this Territory, in whom your petitioners have the most unlimited Confidence: together with the erection of such a tribunal as will be able to test the right of property in Contest between Indians and Citizens of the United States. - - - -
<pb#786 />
But these suggestions are made, with the Greatest defference, and with the utmost Confidence, that the facts being now before Your Excellency, Whatever is right, will be done: "
With These Sentiments and wishes we are your Prayerful petitioners A. Buyck administrator Estate of Francis R Sanchez G. Du Pont Pab° F. Fontane for himself &

<source>[NA:WD, QMG Letters Recd.:ALS]</source>
<place-time>PENSACOLA, W. F. October 5* 1823.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, Conformably to your order of the 15" May last,” I
have the honor to report such facts relating to the proposed roads to be cut, as I have been able to procure from information & by personal observation, with Estimates of the probable expense attending each.—
From this place to Blakely there are three Routes now travelled.
The first by carriages, crossing the Perdido River at a Ferry 21 miles from here, and thence until it intersects the Road from Blakely to Claiborne, 14 miles above Blakely. The Second is a trail crossing the Perdido at a ferry a few miles lower down & thence directly to Blakely. The third, also a trail, to a ferry over the Perdido where it expands into a Bay three miles wide. The first of these Routes is estimated to be 70 miles, the second 53 & the last 65 miles. Each passes over level pine barren. The first & last cross no streams except the Perdido. The Second, besides the Perdido, crosses the Rocheblave & Styx—inconsiderable Streams easily bridged. The
<pb#787 />
Middle Route is to be preferred because it connects the two places in the shortest line & will be but little more expensive than those which are circuitous. I recommend however that it should cross the Perdido at the upper ferry, because where the trail crosses it, the river Swamp is nearly a mile wide and so low as to render a raised causeway or kind of bridge necessary for most part of that distance, whereas there is no Swamp at the upper ferry; it will not increase the distance more than 5 miles to cross here & besides a Bridge can be thrown across the River at this point without difficulty & at a small expense.
I estimate the entire expense of this Road at $4200.—There is a trail from this place towards Mobile point, crossing the Perdido at the lower ferry, but it terminates at the head of Bon Secour Bay, an Arm of Mobile Bay, about 15 miles from the Point. This last 15 miles however can be travelled on horseback by crossing the narrow neck of land, about three miles wide, over to the Sea Beach & then on it to the Point. This neck of land is for its whole extent a succession of sand ridges running for the most part prallell to the coast, & through them it would be difficult to find a good route; but it is quite possible that one may be obtained by digging away the intervening cross Ridges & thus connecting the low intervals with each other. At all events the Sea Beach will itself afford a firm though exposed road.
Instead however of crossing the Perdido at that ferry, I would recommend establishing a new one still lower down crossing it where it is only half a mile in width & by this ferry the route would be more direct perhaps than that the trail now is upon. There is another route might be adopted for the road to the point;—to continue on the proposed Road to Blakely until it crosses the Perdido & then file off to the left for the head of Bon Secour Bay & thus avoid the wide ferry altogether; but this would be circuitous, -70 miles at least, whereas the direct route will not exceed 50 miles.—I estimate the expense of opening this Road on either route at $6000.
I beg leave also to suggest the propriety, as well as importance in a military point of view, of connecting Blakely with Mobile Point, by a road to intersect that from Pensacola at the head of Bon Secour Bay;
the distance from Blakely to the point of intersection will be about
35 miles.—I estimate the expense of this road at $3000.—Blakely is connected with Mobile by a Steam Boat, Ferry Boat; the distance between the two Towns is nine miles.—
From this place there is a good Wagon Road to Frazier's, (marked Taitsville on the map) near which place it forks, the left via Sizemore's ferry on the Alabama River to Jackson & St. Stephens, & the right to Claiborne; there is also a Road direct to Burnt Corn from Frazier's.—St. Stephens and Claiborne are connected with each other by good roads for a newly settled country, also with all the important points & Towns of Alabama. There is a very good road from St.
<pb#788 />
Stephens, East of the Tombeckbee River, via Tuscaloosa and Huntsville, A. to Nashville in Tennessee. A Road, I understand, has been laid out from Tuscaloosa to Claiborne & which Is in part already opened. A Road North from Pensacola into Alabama would strike the River at Cahawba. This Road was laid out last Spring by the inhabitants of Alabama & of Florida. Running South from Cahawba it strikes the Escambia River at Beauman's ferry near the Territorial line. I am informed that the people of Alabama contemplate opening their end of this Road shortly, & the Floridians are endeavoring to raise a Sum by subscription sufficient to open their part.—The Settled parts of the State of Alabama are very generally connected with each other by tolerable Roads, & only require some to be cut for general purposes in doing which the aid of the Government will be at all necessary. The Road to Frazier's requires to be straitened &
improved & the Road to Beauman's ferry also ought in my opinion to be opened. I estimate the expense of doing both at $4000,—that is, $2000 for each.—
Pensacola, though possessing no importance at present in a commercial point of view, will gradually become a place of considerable export. There is a vast tract of fertile Country rapidly populating of which she is the natural place of deposit. The roads proposed to be opened are important in promoting the Settlement of the Territory, as well as highly important for military purposes. In a future maritime War, the advantages resulting from having a secure harbor for Wessels in the Gulf of Mexico, easy of ingress & egress, where they can not only be supported by a military force from the rear, but be abundantly supplied with provisions & water, will give to this City &
Port their true character & Rank. All the Roads contemplated can be conveniently opened by the Troops on this station in a very few years with advantage to themselves and to the Government. Want of occupation is the bane of the military profession & the monotony of a Garrison life seldom fails to enervate the officer and destroy the efficiency of the Soldier.—
I enclose for your inspection a map of Alabama" published in August last & received a few days since from Philadelphia. I have sketched on it the Roads & trails spoken of in this letter. You will perceive that the trail is marked on it from Deer point towards St.
Augustine;" and also that which I recommended for the Mail Route
<pb#789 />
from Fort Mitchell. Should the mail hereafter be established on this Route, I have to observe that it would also be more direct to Mobile than the Route the mail now travels to that city.—
If I should happily succeed in laying out the Roads already ordered in such manner as to give satisfaction to the Department, I should be exceedingly gratified to be ordered to survey & lay out the Roads to Blakely & Mobile Point.”—

<docbody>DEAR SIR; Requiring the friendly assistance of some Gentleman at Washington City, in adjusting my business with the Department of State, and being better acquainted with yourself than any other individual at that place, though my knowledge of you has been derived from the transaction of official business, and the recommendations of Judge Breckenridge, and my much lamented friend Dr. J. C.
Bronaugh, I have taken the liberty of addressing you upon the subject.
I am extremely anxious to make a final settlement with the Department, in relation to the monies in my hands, and for that purpose enclose my accounts with the necessary vouchers. I also forward you an order for one quarter's salary which you will be so good as to apply to the discharge of any balance which may appear against me. The charge in favor of M" M*Neil, who acted as Clerk, whilst the duties of Governor as well as those of Secretary of the Territory were performed by me during the absence of Governor Duval, I think perfectly correct, as it has heretofore been allowed in similar cases in this Territory.—
The item charged for the disbursement of the public money, I view as reasonable and just. I do not believe, that it was contemplated by the Government, that I should incur the risk and responsibility of holding a large sum of public money in my hands, and making the disbursements with out some compensation—
<pb#791 />
Whatever balance may remain in my favor after settlement, you will oblige, by transmitting it to me, in the shape of a check on the Branch Bank at New Orleans. This business would have been sooner attended to, but for my absence at St. Augustine. I wish my account closed, if possible, before the meeting of Congress. Your attention to this business will confer on me a great obligation."—
With my best wishes for your health and happiness, and with a sincere desire to become personally known to you, I remain Sir, Yr. Mo. Obt Hble Sert.

SIR Your letter of the 28” Ult” on the subject of the claims on the Corporation of this City, was this day received; ” In reply to the part where you recommend that I forward vouchers in the most accurate form; I deem it my duty to state; that when this Territory was a Spanish Province, the concerns of this City were managed by an Alcalde (or Mayor) and a board of Aldermen elected by the people, who continued to exercise the duties of their offices for some time after the cession; and until General Jackson by ordinance dissolved that body, and himself appointed a Mayor and six Aldermen with authority to levy and collect taxes to meet the city expences;
Congress however prohibited by law the collection of taxes by the City Council appointed by Gen' Jackson.
The present Corporation are elected by virtue of an act of the Legislative Council," and consider themselves bound to see the debts contracted by their predicessors paid; without possessing the means of doing so—and having doubts of their authority to tax the Citizens for that purpose—
When Gen' Jacksons Council came into office the city was not in debt: The present Corporation have paid their expences, and owe nothing; all the demands against this City originated with Gen.'
Jacksons Council: The President of the United States, as communicated to me by the Hon' the Secretary of State has been pleased to
<pb#792 />
direct that these Debts (and which principally arose during the prevelance of the fever of 1821) should be paid, and I can only state, that the accounts and certificates forwarded in April last, are all the vouchers which can be furnished at this time: I have no doubt but they will by the Secritary of State be deemed satisfactory—when the money is paid to the individual creditors, their receipts will be taken and forwarded to your Office, to shew that the money has been justly and truly disbursed—The individuals who had claims on the former City Council, presented their accounts to them, and as there was no funds in the Treasury, their accounts were examined, the sums due stated, and a certificate given for the amount, to be paid when in funds; and an entry made on the Corporation books—
Many of these certificates have been assigned, and passed into different hands—
I state these facts to shew, that it is not possible for the present corporation to furnish vouchers until they pay the money”
With much respect I remain Your obed" Serv"

SIR, Judge Brackenridge has ordered one of the public Buildings in this Place, to be repaired and fitted up for a Court House and Jail for the use of the Superior Court of the U States for this District;
and has directed me to cause the work to be forthwith done, so as not to exceed $1500 –
I have contracted for the work; it is in a state to be completed very shortly—The work in repairing this Building, for the purposes above named, has been indispensible as there is no such thing in the District of West Florida as either Court House or Jail—Cases are very frequently occurring which makes it absolutely necessary that the government should have some safe place of confinement for prisoners—on this last, I have much difficulty, having either to apply to the Military Authority, or to hire a guard when prisoners are apprehended under the laws of the U. States—The Court could not be accommodated without those repairs on the House, as it was both inconvenient, and uncomfortable; besides the Building belongs to the Government of the U. States, and the House is well worthy of those repairs; without them it would be soon worth nothing; with them it will be a good building for 20 years. There is no law in force
<pb#793 />
in this Territory, by which money can be raised from the Inhabitants to [build] either Court House or Jail; Congress having at the last Sission repealed the act of the Legislative Council authorising a tax to be levied for the purpose of building Court Houses and Jails"—
In making out the Abstracts for Court expenses for the September Term, I have put into Abstract no. 4, $1500 for those repairs—
I have been unable to determine whether I should have done so or not, not knowing upon what fund to draw?
If the fund appropriated for Court expenses generally, cannot pay for such repairs; or if there be a special appropriation for the purpose;
or if I should have drawn upon the fund appropriated for the Territory of Florida; or it be a Subject of reference? In the latter case will you be kind enough to submit the matter to the President? If the former please give me such information, through the Hon. John T. Johnson,”
(who will be in the City by the 1st of Decr) as will enable me to proceed correctly, as the money will be wanting as early as possible?
I shall set out in two or three days for Kentucky and shall return with my family to this place in the Spring—If any other communication from me should be necessary, to arrange this matter, I should be glad to be advised of it through my friend Mr. Johnson before I leave Kentucky?
If it should be a Subject to be Submitted to the President, and paid out of the Florida appropriation; if it be allowed, will you have the goodness to hand the draft to the Hon. John T. Johnson, who will forward it to me? Such information (should there be any difficulty attending it) as you can give me on the Subject will be most thankfully received—Judge Brackenridge has written to Joseph Anderson Esquire, on the subject *—With Sentiments of the highest respect *

<place-time>PENSACOLA, W. F. October 21* 1823.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to report that I shall commence my march to St. Augustine on or before the 23” Inst. I shall probably be absent until about the middle of January and in the mean time shall not be able to furnish monthly summary statements &c as heretofore. So soon as I return I shall render my accounts for the
4" Quarter in this year.”—
I have made such arrangements as I believe will ensure the regular supply of fuel, forage, Stationary &c, to the troops, during my absence.—
Since the receipt of your letter on that subject I have endeavored to engage a competent clerk to leave my office in care of, but without success.—I have therefore retained Capt. Crupper in public employ while I am employed in the Survey of these Roads, trusting that when all circumstances are considered the amount thus disbursed will be allowed to my credit either on his receipt for the money or on a
<pb#795 />
charge in my own name for the amount actually paid for clerk hire.—
If your order directing me to make these surveys had also authorized me to suspend my duties here I should not have required a clerk for the time being, and after my return I could have made out for a while with any person who could write a good hand and was somewhat versed in accounts. But I was not relieved & moreover it would have been very difficult to have got any officer of the line now here to relieve me, so much reluctance exists among the officers to embarrassing themselves with public accounts in a staff appointment only temporary.—I am now accountable for all supplies that are purchased and delivered during my absence on contracts made by myself; and my own security, & the safety of those who signed my Bond, rendered it necessary for me to leave in charge of my office, a person who knew precisely what was allowed by Regulations, & who, out of personal friendship for me, would attend to getting the proper Returns &
receipts & keep my papers in order; these considerations may be trifling to those who are not responsible but to me they all are important—accidents may happen to me in the Wilderness of Florida
& my securities must not be troubled about any final settlement of my accounts.—This is the only instance in which I have ever departed from the strict letter of my orders, (and I viewed your letter as an order to discharge Capt. Crupper) but I have done what I
thought was not only necessary for my own safety, but for the public interest. I know too well the difficulty of keeping property accounts square especially of forage & of fuel; and even if I should lose the amount thus paid for clerk hire, I shall at least have the satisfaction of being able to render my accounts on a final settlement without soliciting allowances for losses or deficiencies.—
So far as it regards the legality of employing Captain Crupper it appears evident to me that when a Citizen, whose services cannot be coerced, as in the case of an Officer of the Government, is employed by a public agent that the fact of the Citizen's being indebted to the Government can be no bar to his receiving pay, provided the Agent was authorized to engage the person at all in such employment;-it would be optional with the Citizen to render those services or not, &
no one would without a prospect of being paid.—In this particular instance I know Capt. Crupper to be wholly dependent upon his personal labor for support, and could not have engaged to remain here, even if he had wished to do so, without an assurance that he should be paid.—It may perhaps be asked why he does not seek employment elsewhere;—In reply to this I have only to say that he preferred remaining with me, (until the receipt of your order to discharge him,) to other employment although I paid him for his services less than the Commonest Store-clerk in the Country gets.
Ease & leisure could have been no reason for his remaining here for
<pb#796 />
I require more writing in the office by one half than is done by any Clerk at Washington, & living is much more expensive here than there.*—

<docbody>HIS EXCELL" Win P DUVALL St Augustine Florida SIR, Your letter of the 2nd Ult” was duly received.” Upon a review of all of the circumstances the following principle has been adopted for the Settlement of your claim to compensation as Supirintendent of Indian Affairs in Florida, to wit:
For the time past when there was no Indian Agent for Florida, an allowance will be made to you, as Superintendent, at the rate of
<pb#797 />
$1500 per annum, which is the rate of compensation allowed to the Indian Agent now authorized by law.
Since the appointment of an Indian Agent for the Territory in virtue of the authority above mentioned and for the future, an allowance will be made to you at the rate of $750 per annum which is intended to cover the expense for Clerk hire, office rent and all others necessarily incurred by you in your intercourse with the Indians;
that being the same amount as is now allowed to the Governor of the Arkansaw Territory and is considered a fair compensation for all expenses incurred by him of a similar nature.
If you will forward an account, for your past services, made out upon the principle mentioned stating distinctly and particularly, the time that you have acted when there was no Indian Agent for Florida, and the time since there was an Agent, to the end of the present year duly certified by yourself, it will be passed to the 2nd Auditor with directions for its Settlement accordingly.
The allowance thereafter, at the rate of $750 per year may be embraced in your quarterly estimates and will be regularly remitted with the funds required for the other expenses incident to your Superintendency.”

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to inform you of my arrival here on the 23"

I have found matters on the Island in rather an unpropitious State—yet far from being so bad as might have been expected.
Out of about 140 persons on the Island, Officers, Seamen and Marines, 59 are Sick, principally with intermittent fevers, only one case out of the whole assuming, at this time a malignant Type—they are however all in a very low state & I have engaged two vessels which I found here by accident to Transport them to Norfolk at $10—p'

With the two vessels in which I send the Sick, I shall Send Doctors Williamson & Hoffman"—leaving Surgecns Mates Conway,” Van Brunt * & Boyce,” who will be quite Sufficient for any exegences likely to occur, -I would however recommend your Sending out a Surgeon and one or two mates as soon as convenient to relieve those gentlemen Be assured you have nothing to apprehend from further desastrous consequences, as I shall take care to place every thing in the best possible State before I depart.—
All the large Wessels I find have gone home except the Spark and Grampus—The former is I am told cruising on the South side of Cuba
& the latter in the Gulf of Mexico and may probably return here SOOn.-
Neither of the Schooners which were at Washington when I left there have arrived—neither has the Ferret Lt. Duncan * yet made her appearance—The Porpoise Lt. Ramage” was the only vessel of war found here on my arrival, the Wild Cat and Jackall arrived yesterday.—

<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
SIR My embarresed situation owing to my exertions to serve the Public, I hope and trust will be considered an apology for the liberty I have taken to address you. I was appointed by Gen' Jackson in 1821. Sheriff of S" Johns County there being no Territorial Funds to defray the expences contingent to the Office, I was under the necessity to expende all the money I could get, and by so doing contracted debts that I am not able to pay, in many instances gave my note. Soon after the Governors arrival in East Florida I informed him of my situation and afterwards presented to him my acc" which he informs me has long since been sent to the Sec of State but no answer as yet has been received.
My creditors got impatient sued me, and what property I have must be sacrifised if relief is not afforded me immediately. I would go to the seat of Government for my demand, but the distance is to great and I have not the means to reach Washington, exclusive of this dificulty I have a Family dependent on my daily exertion for support and have been ever since the close of the War, at which time I was dismissed from the service to give place to a favorite of some one of the board who made the selection, and soon after was offered by M. Dalles then acting Sec of War a first Lieut" Commission to fill a vacancy in the Artillery, to compensate me for the injury done by depriveing me of a Capt" Com" in the same corps I have served the U.

<docbody>D* SIR, I enclose the proceedings of the Court Martial in the case of Captain Eastman for your consideration. The case appears to be a plain one, and he is generally considered as a very unworthy member of the military establishment.
I also enclose the Treaty with the Florida Indians, with the Journal of the Commissioners and the letters of Gov" DuVal, and Col. Gadsden.” The object of transmitting the papers at present is to obtain your decision on the proposition of the Governor to commence running the lines forthwith, and to take a military position on Tampe-Bay for the reasons which he has assigned. It certainly seems desirable on every account, that another year should not pass away without concentrating the Indians on the place proposed for their permanent home; and it is believed, that unless the lines should be run without delay it will be impossible to effect this desirable object. There is another reason for acceding to the request of the Governor. So little is known of the Country which has been fixed on for the Indians, that the Commissioners have been compelled to have the Northern limits of the tract, Subject to be altered hereafter, if it should appear, that there is not a sufficiency of good land in that which has been reserved. It seems to me desirable that the line Should be definitively fixed before the Treaty is ratified by the Senate, which may be done by running the line, and giving our Commissioners discretionary power for that purpose. The general information which will be acquired of the tract by runing the line, will not doubt be very Satisfactory to the Senate, when it comes to act on the Treaty. For these reasons, and as the expense will be Small, it seems to me that it would be proper to accede to the request of the Governor. I have no doubt, but that Col Gadsden, and Lieu" Ripley* are well qualified for the duty of running the line. -
I received your letter enclosing one from Gov" Robertson' on the Subject of removing the troops from Baton Rouge. I can find no trace of the resolution of the Legislature of Louisiana, to which the Governor refers; nor have I any recollection of ever having Seen it.
It will be difficult to reply to the Gov" without having a Copy of the
<pb#801 />
resolution, and as it may be among your papers, I have delayed answering his letter, till you can make a Search for it.
I regret to hear that M" Monroe is indisposed. I would have written Some days Since, but expected you in the City from what M” Hay stated, till this morning.
We have nothing new.”

SIR. The President not having returned to the city as I expected, I have transmitted to him the treaty with the Florida Indians and all the papers which accompanied it, with the letter of Gov" Duval"
requesting that you may be immediately appointed the commissioner,”
and that L" Ripley be associated with you to run the lines of the land assigned to the Indians by the treaty. I have recommended that the request of the Governor be acceded to, and as soon as I hear from the President will inform you of his decision.
By a provision of the Treaty it appears that rations of bread & meat are to be furnished for the Indians, whose number by an estimate which accompanied the treaty is represented to be about 4,800. The views of the Commissioners in making the provision are not stated sufficiently distinct to understand whether it was their intention that the rations of bread & meat are to be furnished indiscriminately for the whole number, or to those merely, who may move on the lands assigned to them by the treaty and in such quantitites only as may be absolutely necessary for their subsistence. If the former be the intention of the Commissioners it will involve a very considerable expense which may present some impediment to the ratification of the treaty. But as I am not aware of any reason why rations should be furnished to so great an extent I am inclined to think, that the latter was their intention, and I am confirmed in this impression by the opinion of Col°
Humphrey’s. It is desirable however to have distinctly the views of the commissioners on the subject, & I will thank you for as full an explanation of them as you may be able to give, accompanied by an estimate of the probable number of Indians for which in your opinion rations will be required.

<docbody>SIR I wrote you on the 25** announcing my arrival here on the

There has been no new cases of fever since I wrote you on the 25th:
and I flatter myself, as the weather is becoming gradually cooler, that none is likely to occur of a worse charracter than intermittant—I am sorry to say that since Com: Porter's departure, the degree of order and regularity which ought to have been expected from his example, has not been maintained—this however has happened not so much on account of a want of capacity or proper disposition in very many of the Officers remaining on the Station—(as to the circumstance of some of those on whom the command has from time to time devolved)
during his absence not possessing the energy, intelligence or discretion to give proper effect in maintaining discipline and supporting the dignity of the Service to which they belong.—
Previous to leaveing the Station, I shall make such dispositions of the several vessels, without changeing materially the plans which have hitherto been pursued as to carry into effect the Views of the Government, and at the same time secure as far as possible until Com:
Porters return, or another Commander shall be appointed, all the advantages to our commerce, which by his zeal and activity he had acquired previous to his departure.—In the mean time I would recommend however that a Sloop of War with a discreet intelligent Master Commandant be sent out to superintend and direct the affairs of the vessels and Station, until the Commander of the Squadron arrives.—
On my return I shall have it in my power to make a full report on everything concerning the naval force employed in those Seas as well as of the establishment on Thompsons Island.
All the observations which I have been enabled to make tend only to confirm me in opinion of the immence importance of this Island in a commercial point of View, notwithstanding there may exist some objections to its climate—the evils attendant on which however I am impressed with a belief can be greatly diminished by artificial means
& judicious arrangements—Such are within the Control of the Government.—
There are at present only two marine officers on the Station, Capt:
Belvue” and Lt Bloodgood,” and as I shall be obliged to send Lt.
Bloodgood home on account of ill health I would suggest the propriety of sending out one or two Marine Officers by the first opportunity-

I did so, and in reply to that letter he informed me that they are to be settled at your department.
Upon a minute examination of the laws of Congress, I am satisfied, that instead of ten Dollars first charged in each case, I am entitled to fifteen, being the fee in Criminal Cases in Alabama. As there is no fee allowed here in Criminal cases, the ten being the Attorney's fee in Civil cases, I have made out my last accounts in that way. The District Attorney of Alabama informs me that he is always allowed extra compensation in prosecutions for Piracy. I will be satisfied to get what the law entitles me to; and have most earnestly to request that my accounts may be adjusted in some way and that you will cause me to be advised of it as soon as practicable."

I approve also the proposal of gov" Duvall, for running the lines, necessary to give effect, to the late treaty, with the Indians in Florida, without delay. I do not consider that measure, as interfering in the slightest manner, with the right, of the Senate, as to advice &cc, but as acquiring the necessary information to enable them to decide, with satisfaction to themselves, on the treaty. I presume that we cannot do better than to commit the trust to Col: Gadsden & L' Ripley—
If you think so, transmit to them without delay the necessary power—
The same view, appears to be applicable, to the military position, on Tampa bay. Those on the ground who are intelligent, honest, & disinterested, can give the best council. If you concur, execute the prior part at once—

SIR I have to inform you that the President has acceded to the request of Gov" Duvall for your immediate appointment as the Commissioner to run the lines of the land assigned to the Florida Indians by the late treaty with them," and for Lieut: Ripley to be associated with you in the performance of that duty." You are accordingly authorized to make your arrangements to commence the survey as soon as practicable, associating Lieut: Ripley with you as your assistant. As the immediate survey of the individual reservations is not material and it is important that all information that can be obtained in relation to the tract assigned to the Indians should accompany the treaty when it is submitted to the Senate for ratification, I would for this reason prefer that this survey should first claim your attention. The reservations if confirmed by the Senate, can be surveyed at any time there after.
If, in making the survey of the tract assigned to the Indians, you should find that the northern line, as defined in the treaty, does not embrace a sufficiency of good land for the accommodation of the Indians, you are authorized to exercise a sound disretion and remove it farther north so as to include the necessary quantity.
The commanding Officer at S" Augustine will be directed to afford you every facility in his power in accomplishing the object of your Commission

<docbody>SIR, The Commissioners have found great difficulty in ascertaining the powers of the provincial Officers of the Spanish Government, from the circumstances of the removal of the public Archives and the want of access to the Ordinances of the King of Spain. They have ascertained that the most important ordinance is to be found in a Work in the Department of State entitled “Neuvissima Recopulation de las leyes de las Indias”—the Ordinance of Ferdinand the 6" in 1754—it is the most important and voluminous one that ever was promulgated upon the subject of conceding crown lands in Spanish America, and would greatly assist us in our examination and decision of claims and titles to land in West-Florida. We have then, respectfully, to request, that you will direct a copy of that ordinance to be forwarded to us from your Department, and any other information, as it is the only place at which we can apply with any prospect of procuring it.

<docbody>A contract has not yet been made for the transportation of the mail on the route from S*Augustine in east Florida, to Pensacola, which was established by act of Congress, in the Session of 1822.
Diligent enquiry has been made, and it does not appear, that there is a road between these places, on the route designated, on which the mail can be convey’d. There are Indian paths, which pass through different Indian Settlements, but none it is understood, that extend for any considerable distance on the proper direction. The want of a road, is not the only obstacle on this route. Almost the whole distance, is an unhabited Wilderness, except a few Indian Villages, and it is represented, that very large and impassable Swamps and lakes, will render the passage of the mail, in some places, impracticable.
The lowest responsible bid that has been made for the conveyance of the mail on this route is four thousand dollars, & it is confidently believ'd, that the route will not add, two hundred dollars to the receipts of the department. As this is an established route, I shall deem it my duty, to accept the best bid which has been made, and close the contract so that an attempt to transport the mail on it may be made unless Congress Shall think proper to modify or repeal the law.”

<docbody>SIR, Upon the termination of the June Term of the U. S. District Court in West Florida I addressed a communication to the Department of State upon the subject of the publick prisons of this District.”
The Grand Inquest for the District of West Florida at the late Term of November 1823 having deemed it their duty to make a presentment upon the matter, I take leave to transmit a Gazette which contains a certified copy of their presentments at the late term, the presentment in question being the first in order—The view taken of the subject in
28 Post, p. 807.
<pb#810 />
this paper of the Grand Jury is not exaggerated, & the situation of the District is consequently a very embarassed one in relation to this concern. At the late Term of the District Court two Offenders were sentenced to two years imprisonment each, who could scarcely have been detained at all but for the courtesy of Col. George M. Brooke of the 4” U. S. Infantry, who has consented to accept them until some arrangement can be made. A previous official application to the same effect made by myself to Major W* Wilson of the 4th U. S. Artillery commanding at Fort Barrancas (where are bomb proof apartments formerly used as state prisons by the Spanish Governors) having been promptly and positively rejected.—Should the Regiment of Infantry be ordered to change their position, it is not possible that prisoners could be safely detained by any means now in the power of the civil authority.—
I have deemed it my duty therefore and I have the honor to submit in this way to your consideration the said subject of presentment and I am Sir with profound respect Your very obedient humble Servant WILLIAM F STEELE U State's Attorney &c HON” JOHN Q. ADAMS Sec” of State U. States

[Enclosure 28]
Presentment of the Grand Jury of the United States District Court in the Territory of West Florida NOVEMBER TERM, 1823.
GRAND JURY ROOM
The Grand Jury for the District of West Florida, for November term, 1823, holden at the City of Pensacola in said District, in conformity with their duty, make the following presentments.
1. The Grand Inquest for the District of West Florida would respectfully present as a great grievance, the present state of the public buildings in this District, the edifice in which the Court is held being ruinous and inadequate to its proper accommodation, and there being no departments for the public offices; but more especially the state of the public prisons, in this district, or rather the total want of them. Refused permission by Congress at their last session to levy taxes for this and other purposes, and unable (even if taxed) at this time, to produce any sufficient amount to effect essential objects;
entirely without public prisons of any description, with a population too thinly distributed to enable the Marshal promptly to summon citizen's guards for the security of prisoners; situated thus, and lo-
<pb#811 />
cated on the extremity of the continent, our District thus, most liable to be made the harbour of fugitives from justice, who here resort to commit crimes with impunity, it has become most peculiarly essential to the safety, prosperity and character of this district, that it should possess the means which safe public prisons afford, to restrain offenders and insure public justice and happiness. The Grand Inquest for this District would therefore respectfully, but most earnestly represent to the government of the United States through the Delegate from this territory, the necessity and importance of an early appropriation for the above objects.
2. The Grand Jury for the said District would also respectfully present as a grievance, the state of things in this District in relation to the payment of dues from the government, to the officers of Court and others in this District. In other districts in the United States, it is believed that the U. S. Marshal is always furnished in advance with competent funds to pay promptly all the expenditures incurred during the terms of the U. S. District Courts at the close of each sitting thereof; while in the District of West Florida, which, from its recent settlement by citizens of the United States, from the general character of its present country population, viz: an industrious class of small farmers, depending upon their own exertions for support;
and lastly, from the extreme pressure of the times, and scarcity of a circulating medium in the District, PECULIARLY demands the course pursued in other districts; it has nevertheless been here, as yet WHOLLY
neglected. It needs only to state, that actual disbursements by Jurors, Witnesses, Deputy Marshals, &c. while attending public business, upon the sittings of the U. S. District Courts at divers times for the last ten months, are still due and unpaid by the government, causing an extreme hardship to citizens who are compelled thus to leave their homes and employments, to attend to public business at their individual expense, a hardship and oppression which the government could never willingly inflict. The Grand Inquest would therefore in this mode respectfully represent this matter to the government through the delegate from the territory
3. The Grand Inquest would present as a matter of great public interest to the District, the subject of an internal navigation between the waters of the Apalachicola River, and the bays of St. Andrews and Pensacola. This line of inland navigation it is believed, from a partial examination already made, can be effected at an expence comparatively trivial, and would in its completion, ensure to the citizens of the respective portions of the District, very important advantages;
the Grand Inquest would therefore recommend to their fellow citizens a continued attention to this object until it be accomplished.
4. The Grand Inquest presents the importance of such a modification of the existing laws of the U. S. relative to the adjustment of
<pb#812 />
“claims and titles to land” in Florida, as may enable the Board of Commissioners in West Florida to effect a more speedy decision of the claims, and thus induce an earlier emigration to Florida; or in failure of obtaining such modification, to endeavor to effect a chauge of the said law, so far as to permit the immediate survey and sale of such public lands in West Florida, as are unembarrassed by claims, and the subject is recommended to the attention of the Delegate to Congress.
5. The Grand Inquest present the importance of a strict attention on the part of Justices of the Peace and other Magistrates to that part of the law enacted at the last session of the Legislative Council of Florida, respecting justices of the peace, which requires such officers duly to recognize, in order to their appearance at the court ensuing, all material witnesses in criminal cases, occurring before them, a duty hitherto much neglected by them, as, without a strict attention to this requirement of the said law, the Grand Inquest are unavoidably impeded in the transaction of their business.
The Grand Inquest would request that a certified copy of the four first ensuing of these their public presentments may be forwarded by the United States Attorney for West Florida, to the Delegate from this Territory, to whose attention they are recommended, with the request, that he adopt all proper measures to effect speedily the object of the first and second of these presentments.
The Grand Inquest further requests that a copy of these their public presentments, after being placed upon the records of the court, be ordered to be published in the next number of the public gazette of West Florida.

PENSACOLA 18th Nov 1823–
SIR It has appeared to me proper that I should make a communication to the Navy Department ere now—but a vain hope that that the evil in question would lessen has heretofore prevented it. During my residence here for the last eight months not a fortnight has scarcely elapsed without the departure from this port of Wessels loaded with Cedar & Live-Oak timber believed by every ehe te be ett by every one to be cut upon the publick lands, nay in many instances known to be, but as the most respectable mercantile houses here engage in such shipments—no one is willing to become Informer—and the actual Trespassers always avoid coming in person to this Port. I have in vain addressed the Dep’ Collector of this port officially—to endeavor to induce him to make the legal requisition in all shipments of Timber viz “actual proofs that the Timber was not cut upon Publick lands”
but I have not succeeded and continual exportation is made of Timber of these rare and valuable Kinds which make it a loss to the publick of no trivial character. As legal proofs upon which the U.S. Attorney would be authorized to libel the Wessel and Cargo, are Scarcely ever attainable in the first instance from the adroitness with which the matter is managed & the Shipments made, the only feasible method is to have them overhauled by a publick Wessel after clearance who would be authorized to detain them upon probable cause of suspicion, which it may be Safely asserted exists in regard to every one of 8 or 10
Wessels which have cleared from this Port with Timber during the last year and will continue to exist.—An Article upon this Subject which appeared lately in the Mobile paper and has I observe been copied into our Gazette here—which as it takes a very correct view (as is here thought) of the matter, and a view more at large than I am willing to adopt in this Communication—I have taken leave to transmit the Gazette alluded to.
Being convinced Sir that my duty to the government required this Communication on a Subject of importance, I trust that any apparently undue earnestness in this matter into which I may have been misled will be referred to that cause.”
With the highest respect I have the honor to be Sir Your most obedient humble Servant WILLIAM F. STEELE U.S. Att’ &c

<docbody>SIR, Captain Pearce arrived at this Port about the 21st Instant in a Small craft from St Johns River, called the only daughter, laden with Live Oak. Information was lodged at my office in support of the following charge viz. That the Lumber on board was cut off the the public Lands in East Florida for the use of the Captain and was taken away by him in a clandestine manner. As the information came direct from one who was on the river St Johns in August last
<pb#817 />
and was an eye witness to the Cutting. I have caused the lumber to be seized and shall hold possession until the pleasure of the Department can be known. The quantity of Lumber is trifling and scarcely worthy of notice, but the consequences are important.”
This and other small vessels if left alone will be employed as carriers in a small way by those who have been, and still are trespassing on the public domain. My information states that in August last the value of lumber then cut down in the neighbourhood of the Cow ford or black Creek would not be less than fifteen thousand Dollars—that a number of persons were then Cutting, but that, one Fairbanks was the Principal The Law for protecting the Timber of the United States in Florida is vague and feeble, I would most willingly have seized upon the vessel if my powers had been sufficient. But the District Attorney wias] of opinion that I could only proceed against the cargo.
You will be pleased to instruct me what is to be done with the present seizure how the informant is to be compensated and what must be my practice in analogous cases.”

<docbody>SIR Since my last letter to you " I have had a conversation with some two or three of the principal chiefs from the South—They seemed much disconcerted at my being ordered to run & mark the Indian boundary line; refused to furnish me any facilities on my march, & even went so far as to request me to postpone my operations, connecting the request with some very ambiguous remarks—I refused most positively to defer the execution of my commission & have directed them to inform their Head Chief that I should be at his Cabin in the nation in a few days prepared to run the line & expect to be accompanied by one of his Warriors selected for the purpose—
Though I am far from believing the Indians would attempt to resist the execution of the orders from the President; yet it is certainly prudent to be prepared for all contingencies—I therefore conceive it my duty to urge the necessity of the speedy movement of the Troops detailed for the occupation of the Bay of Tampa—A military
<pb#818 />
force at that point would not only be prepared to act with effect if necessary; but would in my opinion prevent any disturbance, if there are any restless spirits so disposed, by ensuring to the Commissioners respect, and every facility from the Indians towards the accomplishment of the duties to be performed—
I take the liberty of further suggesting to you the propriety of requesting the Secretary of the Navy to direct the smaller armed Wessels of the West India Squadron occasionally to extend their cruises to the Western coast of Florida, as far North as the Bay of Tampa-The presence at times of Vessels of War in that Bay &
Charlottes Harbor, which are frequented by the Indians, could not but operate most favourably towards the accomplishment of the objects the Government have in view, & would present great facilities to the discharge of the duties devolving on me as Commissioner *

<place-time>STAUGUSTINE 1 Dec 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I leave S*Augustine this day for the S" Johns river and Will without delay execute the Commissions assigned me *—
I must again request that the movement of the Troops detailed for the Post at the Bay of Tampa may be effected as soon as practicable—
If I do not meet with the detachment south I apprehend much embarrassment; independent of suffering, in the execution of the duties undertaken *-
I would likewise again suggest to you the propriety of requesting the Sec of the Navy to direct some of the smaller armed vessels on the W I Station to enter occasionally the Bay of Tampa & Charlotts Harbor—Though the Indians believe that the Americans are numerous
& all powerful on the land, they are not yet convinced of our strength on the ocean—They still retain some of their friendly feelings towards the British & some of the more restless still believe that in the event of any disturbance with the Americans, that aid & succor will be delived from that sourse—Could the American Wessels of War be more freequently seen on the Western Coast of this Territory, it would most effectually dissipate all hopes on that score & the more readily ensure the control over the Savage so much desired—I confess I feel much interest on this subject; having undertaken to act on the late Treaty;
I am more than anxious to witness the complete consummation of its objects—Apprehensions of Indian hostilities are not altogether removed from the minds of the Population of this Territory. They have suffered so severely & so frequently that it is almost impossible to convince them of their present security—The Indians penetrating their timidity of character continue to threaten & have excited alarms of late which it would be gratifying to me to see most effectually removed—They cannot be so, but by the measures proposed; & with a hope that concurring in opinion with me you will speedily act I
conclude "Yours &

<place-time>PENSACOLA December 4* 1823–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. In a somewhat isolated situation, remote from the seat of the general government of the United States,—the people of Florida have been subjected to innumerable evils arising from the want of the requisite information in the government of the means of removing or remedying them.—
Of these evils the most deleterious to us has been the appointment of persons to the Legislative Council, having, with but one or two exceptions, no interest in the Territory;—alike strangers to the language of a great part of this population, to its wants and its resources, having no community of feeling with the inhabitants and in short destitute of the most essential qualifications for the exercise of the sacred trust reposed in them.—
In this situation of things, the people of this Section of the Territory deeply impressed with a sense of the inestimable advantages of choosing their own lawmakers in a republican government, resolved to have a public meeting to recomend to the President of the United States, fit persons to be appointed to the next council. And the following individuals were accordingly proposed and recomended by a large majority-
JOHN LEE WILLIAMS JUAN DE LA RUA
JOHN INNERARITY JOSEF NORRIEGA
JOSEPH M WHITE BENJAMIN T WRIGHT Esqrs.—
For the purpose of affording a still farther and more ample opportunity of eliciting the whole sense of the county; a poll was directed to be held and notices were put up and published.—Which poll took place yesterday, and resulted in the following aggregate of votes-
JOHN LEE WILLIAMS 154— BENJ" TWRIGHT 137–
JOHN INNERARITY 151— TIMOTHY TWITCHEL 45–
JOSEPH M WHITE 150— WILLIAM BARNET- 20–
JUAN DE LARUA 147— SAMUEL FRY- 7–
JOSEF NORRIEGA— 143–
The last mentioned three persons were formerly put up as candidates as you will see by the inclosed printed notice taken from a newspaper called the Floridian.—
<pb#826 />
Colonel White was supported under an expectation that the next session of the Council might be postponed until the Autumn; when his present commission will have expired,—and as a testimonial of the high opinion this community entertain of his integrity and services since his residence here.—
The result of the votes would render any comments a work of Supererogation.—
In point of numerical superiority, this County is entitled to four members to be selected out of the six highest recommended; and we should deem it a great misfortune to the Territory to have any others appointed.
We have only farther to beg leave to wait on you with the resolutions adopted at the first meeting and the notices to which we have referred as printed in, and taken from the Floridian—also a minute of the proceedings of the second meeting and a minute of the result of the poll.”—All which we beg to request that you will be pleased to submit to the President of the United States—We have enly the honor to remain with sentiments of the most profound respect Your Obedient & very humble Servants—

<place-time>United States Attorney’s Office DISTRICT OF WEST FLORIDA 19th Decem" 1823</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I had the honor to address you some few weeks since on the Subject of the destruction of Public Timber in this District & the consequent injury of Naval interests thus effected.” A Sitting of the U. S. District & Circuit Courts for West Florida has since been had in this District and the utmost exertion was made on the part of the U.S. to effect the conviction of three individuals who were charged with the “cutting & selling for transportation &c.”—Several cargoes of Publick timber, red Cedar & live Oak, & who I have no doubt were justly charged—These persons were readily acquitted, owing to their precautionary measures & to the entire indifference in the Publick mind here on the Subject of this depredation. Like acquittals must be the result " of like offences & trials here, until the Government shall adopt some more vigilant preventive measures under the Acts in relation to this Species of Publick property. While I have the honor to hold the office of U. S. Attorney no effort shall be wanting on the part of that officer to prevent or furnish offences of the kind in question—but there is little hope of Success (important as is the matter) under present circumstances.
Applications are frequently made to be by actual Settlers upon the publick lands—upon which there are heavy growths of fine ship timber, viz. of the Live-oak, red cedar, locust & Cypress. and who wish to Settle those lands, to clear and improve them,-in doing which the Trees are either girdled & left to decay or cut down and removed.—
They ask of me information, whether the Government, would consent to purchase this Timber or enter into contracts to receive at Pensacola good Ship Timber necessarily destroyed or cut for the above reasons.
Not being advised as to the course pursued hitherto by the Government, or the Naval Department in this matter, I have been unable to answer the proposed qweries. Should the power to make purchases
<pb#832 />
of Timber under such circumstances be vested in the Naval department, & its exercise be deemed not to be impolitick I will venture to Suggest that if the location of a Naval Agent at this port be determined, his being vested with Such power, would conduce greatly to the preservation of the Publick Timber, not only by preventing its demolition but by Securing to the Government for the use of the Navy (at a cheap rate) large quantities of the most valuable Publick Timber, now entirely lost to it, and what is indeed worse, often exported to British ports.
It is hoped by the Attorney that in these Suggestions he may not be thought to have overstepped the modesty of his duty—but if So, he trusts his mistake will be ascribed to an honest official zeal rather than to any intentional persecution.”
I have the honor to be Sir Very respectfully Your obedient servant WILLIAM F STEELE Attorney of the U.S. &c. &c HON. SAMUEL L. SOUTHARD Sec” of the Navy &c. &c

<place-time>Pensacola 20 December 1823–</place-time>
<docbody>(Translation)
SIR/ At the time of its delivery to the American Governm" I had the honour of being the Constitutional Alcade of this Province, when I determined to withdraw from my Regiment in the Spanish Service, and live under the free institutions of the United States, resolving to submit to their laws, and hoping for their privileges. Such were my flattering anticipations and intentions but the unmerited persecution to which I have been subjected by the malevolence of the District Attorney Mr. Wm F. Steele has induced me to make an exposé of the circumstances to the Governm" of the U. States, and should they tolerate such proceedings and outrages the ancient inhabitants must seek security by an abandonment of their homes, and a refuge under their old Government.
Sometime last Spring a rencounter took place between a Spanish Cadet, and an American Shopkeeper, in which I interposed and parted the Combatants. They were taken up, and I among the rest, and brought before a Justice of the Peace as rioters, and upon a full examination before [MS. torn] Justices I was discharged. M Steele arrived a few days afterwards, had another warrant taken out, and brought me before the Mayor and another Justice, and upon examination I was
<pb#833 />
again discharged. At the next term of the Superior Court he moved to have a Bench Warrant issued against me, which was refused. At the term of the Court he sent up six Indictments successively against me which were all returned, “Not found.” Insatia.[ble] in his persecution he endeavoured again to have me bound over to answer at the next term of the Court which the Hon.” Judge refused, and at the late term of the Superior Court he had me again arrested, and sent before another Grand Jury four indictments for riot, assault, affray, trespass, &ca in a matter in which I only interposed as a peace-maker—The Grand Jury however, at the first term indignantly returned some of those bills saying “they had acted on the same subject,” and that this repetition was not calculated “to promote public Justice but to engender animosities in the community;” and the four last indictments were again returned—“Not found.” The two young gentlemen who were engaged in the fight have had as many as eighteen indictments sent up against them, and have been induced to believe that the Inquisition is a merciful Tribunal compared with an American Court in which such a man as W" F. Steele officiates as Minister.
I inclose a certificate of the clerk of the Court in support of these facts, and a Copy of the presentments against the Attorney himself at the last Court for drunkenness and other immoralities. I am aware, Sir, that it is not the Govern", but its unworthy representative to whom blame can be imputed but such outrages have already driven many, and will soon drive many more from the Country unless he is removed. I have, therefore, humbly to request that you will be pleased to lay this letter with the accompanying documents before His Excellency the President of the United States, and receive the homage of respect with which I have the honour to subscribe myself—

<place-time>TERRITORY OF FLORIDAY [December 20, 1823]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled—
The Memorial of the under signed Citizens of that portion of the Territory called East Florida—Respectfully sheweth—
That your Memorialists composed of the Inhabitants of Amelia Island and the adjacent Country beg leave to represent to your Honourable Body the advantages that will arrise to the Territory and to all others concerned if their petition be granted—We pray that your Honourable Body will pass such regulations respecting the wrecking vessels that receive their cargoes on the coast of Florida, as may be most benificial to all concerned the underwriter, the owners
& wreckers—We therefore pray you will take into consideration the following statement—The wrecking business has been carried on for many years by British subjects, under proper regulations and restrictions; which are absolutely necessary to secure a correct division of the property saved—The enterprising American Citizens will now partake of that lucrative business, and no doubt a large amount of property will be saved to the owners and underwriters; if judicious laws be instituted, to put on an equal footing the wrecker, owner and under-
<pb#835 />
writer, that the property so saved, may be divided agreeable to the Laws of our country; which can not conveniently be done without all the wrecked property saved should be brought into some particular ports and there sold for the benefit of all concerned. We therefore beg leave to suggest the propriety of having some convenient and Safe Port in Florida, where all vessels that have wrecked goods on board shall deliver their cargoes; the owners, underwriters & wreckers can have their agents to attend to their interist; it will secure to the United States a considerable revenue, and to the underwriters their proportion of the property saved—at present if a vessel is wrecked and the Cargo is saved by different wrecking Wessels each vessel takes in a cargo and proceeds to a port most convenient for the master, and every vessel might go to a different port, how then is the Captain who is a general agent for the underwriters able to attend to their interist;
and perhaps it is not known to Him to what port the wrecking vessels are bound—If some particular ports is disignated in which all wreck goods shall be deposited, the Captain can then remain, at the wreck until the last of His Cargo is shipped, and sure to find the property in the hands of the agent for the underwriters—We therefore pray that your honourable body will disignate the Port of Fernandina
(Amelia Island) as the Port of deposit for all wrecked goods that may be saved to the East of Cape Florida; and all vessels going on a wrecking voyage shall give bonds before they depart, to deliver all the wreck goods they may find on the coast of Florida in the said Port of Fernandina, and there to be sold agreeable to Law—The advantage that would arrise to this Territory and the United States will be greater;
at present many of the wrecking vessels carry their wreck goods to Nassaw New Providence, by which the United States are deprived of the benefit that should arise from the wrecked property saved.—
Your Memorialists submit with great respect to the consideration of your Honourable body the facts here in stated.

<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled—
The Memorial of the undersigned Citizens of that portion of the Territory called East Florida—Respectfully sheweth—
That your Memorialists Composed of the Inhabitants of Amelia Island and the adjacent Country, beg leave to represent to your Honourable body the grievance which they Suffer by being depriv" of their former privilege as a free Port—Fernandina was made a Port of Entry in the year in 1811, and continued so until the Cession; at that period it was annexed to the collection district of S* Marys Georgia—The inhabitants not having committed any act to forfeit their right, think it hard, that they should be deprived of getting their supplies; except at a great expence by sending to Georgia for them—It likewise prevents all enterprise, as their is no encouragement for the inhabitants of Florida entering into foreing trade, as the advantages arrising must go to the state of Georgia, under the present collection division of this Country—The hardship of entering vessels there and giving bonds, is very great; as many that would enter into the commercial line residing in Florida cannot secure the duties in Georgia; when it would not be inconvenient to secure them in Florida;
all which embarrassments discourage the inhabitants of Florida entering into any foreign speculation, although they have many articles for exportation both for the European and West India Trade—at present our supplies of West India produce come from the Nothern states but which if we had a free trade we should import direct—
Fernandina (Amelia Island) is the only good and safe Harbour in East Florida;—at the spring tides twenty one feet of water is on the Bar, which is no way dangerous; it is spacious and safe for National Wessels as well as merchantmen—Our Exports at present consists of the best Sea Island cotton for the European Market, and a large quantity of naval Stores will in time be shipped—For the West India market Ranging Timber sawed Lumber—spars—staves—shingles
&°. the proceeds of which would be returned here in West India been understood to be in operation and had already produced a large revenue for the United States (Cong. Debates, 18 Cong., 2 sess., pt. 2, col. 697). In the next session of Congress the same committee introduced on Jan. 17, 1826, a bill to annul an act of the Legislative Council concerning wreckers and wrecked property passed July 4, 1823 (Fla., Acts, 1823, pp. 128-132). Remarks regarding the evil results of this act were made by Rep. Webster for the committee and by Del.
White in justification of the Council's action in passing the act (Cong. Debates, 19 Cong., 1 sess., pt. 2, col. 998). An act of Congress approved Feb. 1, 1826, annulled the Florida act (4 STAT. 138).
<pb#838 />
Produce, the duties arrising would be considerable—we therefore pray that your Honourable body will take our case into consideration, for although no immediate advantage might derive to the United States, in time it will be the Emporium of Florida for European and West India goods—We therefore pray that you will admit Fernandina to be a port of entry with all the privileges granted to a port in the states—
Your Memorialists submit with great respect to the consideration of Your Honourable body the facts herein stated.

SIR, Your letters of the 26 * & 29" Ultimo " and the 1* instant have been received.
The order for the movement of the troops detailed for the occupation of Tampa Bay was given immediately after the receipt of your first letter on the subject; " and it is hoped they will arrive at their destination in time, to afford you any aid that may be necessary to facilitate the performance of your duty.
The letter which you enclosed for Col° Humphreys has been delivered to him.
The treaty has been ratified by the Senate; & Col° Humphreys is ordered to repair forthwith to his post to attend to its execution.”
A copy of the order is enclosed for your information. It is impossible to give specific instructions here for the execution of the treaty; and the Agent is therefore directed to consult with the Governor & yourself in the measures to be taken for that purpose. You will accordingly afford your advice and take the course which may in your judgment be necessary & proper, having the most rigid regard to economy.
Your request “that some of the smaller armed vessels on the West India station may be directed to enter occasionally the Bay of Tampa
& Charlotte Harbor” has been submitted to the Secretary of the Navy, who has replied that he would order commanders to comply with your wish.
<pb#840 />
The Bill which you have drawn on this Department for $125 will be paid when presented and charged as requested.
Lieut. Ripley & yourself will proceed to run out the reservations after you have completed the survey of the principal tract assigned to the Indians. It is desirable that the whole should be completed as soon as practicable.
In a former letter I stated that the additional compensation which you propose should be allowed to Lt Ripley,” would be fixed after your report of the survey is received.”

That his Catholic Majesty the King of Spain reserved to himself the right of 1500 Warras (equal to 1395 yards 2% feet) round all fortified Towns in Florida: commencing from the flagstaff, and forming a circle, for the conveniance of defending the place; when not required by the King the Inhabitants were allowed to cultivate the same—The said ground has been measured and planted by the poor Inhabitants for many years, from which they obtain their support—

The Negroes to which the memorial refers were found among the Indians in Florida when that territory became the property of the U States, and as the Department did not possess any particular information as to the relation in which they stood to the Indians or of the existence of a claim to them on the part of our citizens, no instructions
<pb#843 />
were given to the Commissioners, who negotiated the late treaty with the Florida Indians on the subject; consequently no provision respecting it was made by that treaty.
The President has no power under the existing laws relating to the Indians, to authorize the erection of such a tribunal as you suggest, to try the right of property, to the negroes in question, between the Indians and our Citizens. The only proper course therefore for the claimants is by application to Congress through their delegate, who I have no doubt will promptly attend to any request they may make on the subject.

<place-time>S" AUGUSTINE Jan. 6* 1823. [1824]</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. The course I have pursued in the Commission has been too distinguished for its regard to the interests of the United States not to be a subject of very considerable surprise that there should be any delay in the confirmation of my appointment to which effect and for your particular satisfaction permit me to refer you to communications in the possession of M* Loyd * of the Senate M. Edwards” of the same and M. Hayward * of the House—In the knowledge that the community are satisfied with the integrity and intelligence of my conduct I have declined answering the publications of my Colleagues in defense of their decisions and the more gratified have I been with the estimation of the public as my investigations have been strict and extensive—
I must particularly request that my name may not be withdrawn"
as I cannot submit with indifference to the invidious interpretation of a Compromise—I make no crimination of my Colleagues leaving the public to judge if I be compelled to make an exposition—
I have desired the Board to report our proceedings to the Secretary of the Treasury as it is absolutely necessary that there should be an extension of our session at least until the end of the next Session of Congress which they have declined upon the ground of a difference of opinion in the Board—A conclusive reason why we should communicate, as affording the best evidence of the conduct of the Commissioners—If the Commissioners perform their duty with resolution the Nation has an additional and valuable cause to be satisfied with conduct of General Jackson in detaining from Governor Coppinger the papers pretended to belong to the Spanish Nation—I am sorry to say that the full benifit of the detention has been frustrated by the determination of the Board, not to take possession of these papers, and that those only have he secured which were detained in virtue of a subpoena duces te cum issued at my request—
With sentiments of the highest respect I have the honor to remain Your Ob Sevt ALEXANDR HAMILTON

<source>[NA:GLO, PLC, East Fla. Repts., 1822–1823:LS]</source>
<place-time>S* AUGUSTINE 8 January 1824–</place-time>
<docbody>To/ DAVIS FLOYD Esq."
SIR It is with much pleasure I reply to your note of this morning, in the hope that a full explanation of our respective views of the course most adviseable for the Commission to pursue, may lead to the adoption of such regulations as will tend to facilitate the discharge of the important and delicate responsibilities, with which we are entrusted—
It is for this purpose I submit the following propositions and regulations First—That the Secretary be directed to translate and record, the Royal Orders, the official correspondence, the regulations of the Governors and the Instructions and calculations controling the Surveyors—
Second—That the Commission ascertain whether the Governors of East Florida possessed any authority to dispose of the Public lands independent of the Royal Orders and whether their regulations are to be considered the acts of the Spanish Government and as such to be respected in our adjudications—
Third—That the Commission determine whether the Royal Order of 29* March 1815 authorizing Grants for Military Services be not controlled by that of the 29* October 1790 and what are the conditions refered to in the latter order Fourth—That the Commission ascertain whether the Surveyors were authorised to change the location of Concessions at discretion and in the same manner to divide grants and locate the Several parts and whether they were not subject to certain regulations and the table of Percel explanatory of the Same—
Fifth—That the Commission determine whether they can enquire into the validity of the circumstances of a Grant, anticident to the issuing of the Royal Titles, where the concessions have been made within the authority of the Royal Orders—
Sixth—That the commission decide whether the abandonment of the Province by the British Subjects after its cession to Spain in 1783
did not by operation of the Treaty of Cession, re-attach their lands to the Royal Domain—
Seventh—That the Commission enquire whether Grants containing the customary clause, “without injury to third persons,” were valid against the Spanish Government, if it should appear, that the lands
<pb#848 />
petitioned for had been previously granted, without a Subsequent Decree and order to change the Location—
Eighth—That the Commission ascertain whether Decrees for pasturage and Mill Seats conveyed more than a permission to use the pasture and timber and whether the Government did not reserve the right to concede to others, all the plantable lands contained therin—
Ninth—That the Commission determine whether lands abandoned for more than two years in Succession were not considered vacant lands reverting to the Royal Domain, the Grantee continuing to reside in the province, and whether if so, the effect of such an abandonment can accrue to the benefit of the United States, when the absence of the claimant was an incidental consequence of the rebellion of 1812–
The propriety of establishing these preliminary principles will, I am confident, appear to you necessary upon mature reflection—Without Settling some general law, it will be impossible for the Commission to do justice to the claimants and perform their duty to the United States—The Means of diciding are in the possession of the Commissioners for which the United States are principally indebted to the detention of the Public Documents from Governor Coppinger by the order of General Andrew Jackson—
I again offer for the consideration of the Commission, regulations, the utility of which if candidly examined, cannot fail to meet its concurrence, the more especially as the embarrassment of our present proceedings, practically teach the necessity of resorting to some change
1* Regulation That the Secretary be directed to prepare a discriptive list of the Claims, according to the form presented by me and adopted by the Commission—
2 Regulation That the Secretary be directed to Class the claims under the respective Royal Orders on which they are predicated and that the Commission proceed to the examination and adjudication of the claims in classes— -
First Class Those predicated in the Royal Order of the 29" March
1790 Seperating those with, from those without Royal Titles—
1*Specification those not exceeding 1000 acres
2d ditto not ditto 3500 d"
3d ditto exceeding 3500 d”
Second Class Those predicated on the Royal Schedule of the 17"
June 1801 granting the houses and lots and remitting the principal and interest to the purchasers—
Third Class Those under the Royal Order of 29" of March 1815
authorising bounties for Military Services, divisions and Specifications as in the first class—
<pb#849 />
Fourth Class Those under the Royal Order of September 3” 1817, directing the Intendant of Cuba to dispose of lands in East Florida–
Fifth Class Those emanating from the British Government Sixth Class Those Grants for Services and not predicated in either of the Royal Orders—See Miranda's for 24 Miles and Arredondo's for
20 Miles Square and Buyck's for Fifty thousand Acres—Divisions and Specifications as in first Class—
Seventh Class Those dated after the 24" January 1818 and by the Treaty declared null and void
3" Regulation That the Commission commence as soon as the papers are in readiness to adjudicate upon the Claims under the Order of 1790 and in the meantime, that they collect the evidence in the large Grants to be transmitted to Congress during the present Session—
4* Regulation That in all those cases, within the final jurisdiction of the commissioners, that the Memorial of the claimant, or an abstract of the Same made by one of the Commissioners, together with the original grant, concession or order of Survey be alone recorded, with a Memorandum exhibitting the deraignment of title as follows, that C claims from B by deed bearing date the [blank] day of [blank] in the year [blank] who derived title from A the grantee on &c-wills, deeds, bills of Sale or other mesne conveyances, not be recorded, except by reference as exhibits ABC—
5* Regulation That in all cases beyond the final jurisdiction of the commissioners that the Memorial of the claimant with the documents incident to the grant, the Memorial, Decree, order of Survey, Survey and confirmation or Royal Titles (if there be any) be recorded, together with an abstract of the documentary evidence, but that the deraignment of title be only recorded by reference as in the preceeding regulations
7th Regulation?"
That the Commission will retain through the whole course of the examination of witnesses a Supervisory control, that immiterial and illegal evidence be not recorded—
8" Regulation That it will no longer be the duty of the Secretary to make out Memorials or prepare commissions for the examinations of witnesses—
7° Regulation 6 is not included.
<pb#850 />
9* Regulations That the Secretary will hereafter confine his written translations to material parts of Spanish Documents and in all cases, within the final jurisdiction of the Commission, having Royal titles, the attendance of the Secretary will only be required to give parol translations—
10" Regulation That in all cases where there are Royal Titles, the fees for recording will only be charged on the Memorial and Royal Title, but in all cases on condition, Seeking confirmation fees will be charged on Such records as the commission shall determine essential to the establishment of the claim, when directed to be recorded—
I have been thus particular to avoid the usual misunderstandings incident to the irregular manner in which our proceedings have been minuted and more illegally kept in loose Sheets and I anticipate that you will no longer indulge in so disingenuous an interpretation of my motives, as to imagine that I would attempt to expose the regulations of the commission by the introduction in a disguised form of a practical illustration of their injurious inexpediency—It is impossible that the Commission can investigate the claims with advantage, if they are to be taken into consideration, without any other System than the order in which they have been enterred—I am confident when you have deliberated upon these propositions and regulations you will be convinced of the propriety of their adoption, the more especially if you reflect upon the embarrassments that now procrastinate our examination and that for all useful purposes the business of the commission is now essentially Suspended—I appeal to your candour to acknowledge, whether I have not repeatedly anticipated our present difficulties, as the necessary consequences of the decisions of the Commission and whether your recent anxiety to have perfected the discriptive list submitted by me, might not be considered as conclusive evidence—
I am aware, in some instances arising from the unfortunate indulgence of the Commission in permitting claims to be filed not corresponding with our regulations of the 1* August last, that the memorials present but an imperfect statement of the claim, which, may however be Supplied by a little extra attention on the part of the commissioners in collating from the testimony a brief analysis, or by directing the claimants to file supplementary memorials—
It is with much pleasure I avail myself of your admission that “the time when we must make report to Congress will shortly elapse” to renew the proposition, to report immediately to the Secretary of the Treasury the acts and proceedings of the commissioners and in as much as we have done little more than to order the claims to be filed
(none of which have been recorded) that we suggest the propriety of an indefinite extension of our Session, if our Secretary is to translate
<pb#851 />
and record all the testimony and that further time be allowed for the admission of the numerous claims that remain to be presented I am perfectly willing “to take all the claims now in readiness into consideration,” which state of preparation, according to the decisions of the majority of the Commission will place under our consideration only, thirty seven claims, of which eleven are not within our final jurisdiction notwithstanding we have a Secretary authorized by law, and by two assistants appointed by the Commission—
The following decisions I have uniformly opposed and in my estimation they ought to be reported to Congress The majority of the Commission have decided that all documents presented shall be recorded in extenso and those in Spanish be translated by the Secretary—Thus giving an employment to the Secretary of an indefinite termination and in as much as the mesne conveyances are of indifference to the United States and as Congress has reserved no right to revise our proceedings, within our final powers, there can be no necessity to record the evidence in cases of confirmation as our decisions will undoubtedly be made, upon the force and authenticity of the originals—
The majority of the commission have decided to adjudicate upon claims, where the Grants have issued subsequent to the 24" January
1818—and without giving any reasons for so doing, notwithstanding the Treaty declares, all such grants null and void—
The majority of the commission have decided that the authorization to confirm to actual Settlers to the amount of Three thousand five hundred acres must be understood to include all persons resident in the territory at the time of the cession, and not to be limited to those who were at that period in the actual possession and occupancy of the lands claimed The majority of the commission have decided, that they will adjudicate on claims without examining the original documents while they are aware that the public records in the possession of the Keeper of the Public Archives have been much exposed and are still kept in loose Sheets, without Schedule or discriptive list and that the letter from Governor Kindelan, the foundation of the Royal Order of 1815 has been essentially altered and that transcripts of different import have been funished—The advertisement of the keeper of the Public Archives also make known to the Commission, that a small Grant has been withdrawn from the office and one of 16,000 acres Substituted—
The majority of the Commission have repeatedly refused to report its proceedings while they have unofficially communicated with the Secretary of the Treasury without giving any intimation of the time, manner or substance of their communication The delicacy and propriety of such conduct I do not understand and abstain from comment

“In as much as the commissioners will be able to make final decision of but few Claims and as much time will be necessary to investigate and report Sundry rules, regulations and Customs prevalent in the province relative to granting lands, and as the time when we must make report to Congress will shortly elapse, I would propose for consideration, whether it would not be proper to take all the claims now in a State of readiness into consideration have them recorded and finally decided; and whether we would be able to devote more of the our time & our Secretary to the investigation of new cases or whether probably the whole time may not be necessary to the preparation of those before us—Yours &c—

<docbody>SIR I take the liberty to transmit you the enclosed documents,"
in relation to the collector's office at Pensacola, which will I feel assured, shew the justice and propriety of granting a reasonable salary to that officer. The extracts from the Register's office shew the amount of commissions received by the collector for twenty one months to have been only $138:77/100. The enclosed letter of Sam" Myers Esqr" (formerly of Norfolk) that during the time that he acted as Deputy Collector, the fees and emoluments averaged about fifteen dollars a month, barely sufficient as he very correctly states to defray the expences of printing stationary and fuel, which the collector has himself to furnish. In addition to this, I can from my own experience, state that Pensacola is a very expensive place, the officers exposed to the dangers of an unhealthy climate and the place by no means in a state of commercial improvement. I can further remark that there are few places which present greater facilities for the violation of the revenue laws, and where active and vigilant officers are more required.
Under these circumstances I feel convinced that you will consider it just to allow the collector a reasonable compensation, and that the salary should commence at the time the compensation allowed by the President under the “act for taking possession of the Floridas”
ceased.
<pb#853 />
In order to shew that there are precedents for retrospective salaries to collectors, I beg leave to refer to the case of John B Esseltyne Collector of Cape Vincent, whose commission is dated 7” Aug: 1818
& who by act of Congress, 7" May 1822 Sec: 19 * was allowed a salary to commence from the period of his appointment *

SIR When I took the liberty to write to you yesterday in relation to the Collector's office at Pensacola, I omitted to advert to one circumstance which I consider material. The office of Surveyor of that port, with a salary of three hundred dollars a year, has been created by law. I can with great confidence state that such an officer at Pensacola is entirely unnecessary, the collector being fully adequate to the performance of all the duties appertaining to the office. No teas wines &cc are, or probably ever will be imported into that place, so that a surveyor is without employment. I think therefore the office ought to be abolished, and the Collector should receive a compensation for his services"—

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to inform you that since my departure from St Augustin I have carefully examined the interior of Florida which is in my opinion the most desireable and valuable region in all the Southern Country—Capt. Burch, no doubt has made his report to you of his rout to St Augustin from this place and of course has given in his report a discription of the Country, soil &c."
I visited all the Indian Towns on my rout to this City and endevoured to impress on the minds of the Chiefs the importance of restraining their warriors, and preserving the friendship of the U
States, I am sorry to say that the Indians under the immediate command of Neamathla, have been concerned in killing the cattle, in two days after the troops at St. Marks were removed. I have taken great pains to assertain the real feeling of the Indians toward us—and can reley with some confidence, on the friendship of all the chiefs except Neamathla, he is a man of uncommon capacity, bold, violent and restless—He cannot submit to a superior or endure and equal. No reliance can be placed on him, and his men are the most lawless and vile of the Indians in Florida, I feel confident that they will not remove into the boundary given to them by the late Treaty unless their is a military force in the vicinity to overawe them-
I do not believe that these Indians will dare to commence hostilities—
but they steal from and kill the cattle of the White Settlers whenever they have an opportunity. A few men kept at St: Marks untill the Indians are removed I deem, necessary—

There are unfortunately many in this Country deeply interested in these claims who would be pleased with the appointment of Mr Fry.
I regret to inform you, that great dissatisfaction is felt in this Country with many appointments & particularly those of the last Council—John Lee Williams was recommended at a public election in this County, that election was disregarded and a Boatman by the name of Compton, appointed, upon the pretext that a letter was received from some one who said another could prove something unfavorable to M'. Williams. He is a member of the Bar & his deportment in this Country has been of the most unexceptinable character.
He has afforded me great assistance in the detection of fraud &
Forgery for which he has many enemies, for there is no sin here, so grievous as that of exposing fraud. Judge Brackenridge & many other respectable persons will forward a recommendation before the end of the session in favor of Mr Williams.

GOVERNOR DUVAL TO GEORGE M. BROOKE 18
[NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, XI:Cl PENSACOLA, January 15* 1824
LIEUT. COL GEORGE M BROOKE, Commanding Officer of the United States troops destined for Tampa Bay, SIR, I have been informed that a Wessel has lately landed Wood-
Choppers at Charlotte Harbor or Tampa Bay for the purpose of Cutting timber.
I have received orders from the President of the United States, of the most decisive character, to arrest all persons who may attempt to cut timber on the lands claimed by the Government. In order that I
may promptly execute this mandate of the Government I am specially empowered to call on, any commanding officer either of the military or naval department stationed in or on the Coast of Florida for such aid and assistance as I may deem necessary for this object.
I therefore request, Sir, that on your arrival at Tampa Bay you will send a detachment to Charlotte Harbor and arrest all persons, that may be engaged in cutting timber at that place, or any other on that coast, and by the first conveyance have them sent to Pensacola.
The Government does not admit or recognize any claims to land in that part of Florida as belonging to individuals, and if any such are pretended legally to exist the persons claiming the same must obtain first a confirmation of their grants before they will be permitted to Cut the Timber. If any individual who may set up a claim to land (not admitted by the United States) was at liberty to dispose of the Timber, it is obvious that a pretext would never be wanting on his part to despoil the lands belonging to the United States of the valuable Timber.”
With sentiments of high regard and esteem, I am Your ob" Servant.

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to report that on the 30" December last, I chartered the Brig “Victory”* & the Schooner “Thomas Shields” ” for Tampa Bay. Capt. Brady” who had been sent to Mobile by Colonel Brooke previous to my return chartered the Brig
“W" & Henry”” for the same service—She arrived at Pensacola on the evening of the 8” Inst. Two Companies were embarked on board each Brig. The quartermaster's department here supplied the command with five mules, 225 Bush. corn, 12000" Hay, 35000 feet plank, 16000 Brick, 50 Barrels lime, 1000" Iron, 140" Steel, 600" Nails, Carpenters & Blacksmith's tools & sundry other articles. A flat was built by the order of Colonel Brooke & transported thither in pieces, requiring but a few hours after their arrival to put it together & land the public property—two large & good Boats were also taken by the command. Three months supply of provisions was also shipped on board the vessels. The vessels were fully laden & in addition to her cargo of Stores, the mules were carried on the deck of the Shields.
They sailed on the evening of the 15* Inst. with a fair wind & most
<pb#858 />
probably reached Tampa the third day after.—At my request Colo.
Brooke directed Lt. Triplett” to report to me for the purpose of attending to the removal of the public property at St. Marks; he left here on the 7" Inst. for that Post & will embark it on board the Shields, as she is engaged to call there on her return from Tampa.
Copies of these several charters are enclosed.”—
On the 3" Instant I contracted with Capt. Pindar for the transportation of Col. Fenwick's command to Norfolk—he had however previously been to Mobile & engaged the Ship Henry Hill at the solicitation of Colonel Fenwick & the Gentleman who had charge of my office during my absence.” The Ship was reported to me by the Captain of her, on the 16" Inst. about 11 A.M & during that and the succeeding day, births were put up, the provisions stowed on board & the vessel fully prepared to receive the Troops. On the
18" she dropped down to the Barrancas & on the morning of the 20", by the expiration of the four days provided for in the charter, the Troops were on board & the vessel ready for Sea.—
I enclose herewith duplicates of the contract with Pindar,” the triplicate is retained in my Office. By the terms, $.2100 is payable to his order at your Office. Capt. Post has his order to receive that amount & I respectfully request you will remit him the sum of $.2100, upon the receipt of the order & the proper certificate of the Commanding Officer, in a draft upon such Branch Bank of the U. S.
Bank as he may designate. In order that there might be no difficulty on the subject, I enclose also Pindar's account & receipts for the $.2100
in due form excepting that the receipt is left blank, to include in it the demurrage if there should be any at Norfolk. In making the contract I would have made the whole payable here, but it was necessary for them to receive it at or near to the Port to which they were bound; and to secure to them prompt payment, I deemed it most advisable that the 2100$. should be paid at your office; the Balance $.200, I shall pay here so soon as I am notified that the contract has been fulfilled."—

<docbody>GENERAL, If it is intended by the Department to supply the Post of Tampa Bay by means of a public Transport, I beg leave respectfully to suggest the expediency of selling the Amelia & purchasing another vessel more suitable. She is now twelve years old & I consider her an unsafe vessel both from that circumstance & her size for a Sea voyage of such length. She might last for a year or two yet in the Lake navigation, where in Stormy weather a harbor could be made at all times; but between this and Tampa there is no harbor East of the Appalachicola & that is north of the direct course; besides she is too small, her cargo is less than 200 Barrels & she is sailed at the same expense of one carrying 450 Barrels. I can purchase a Schooner, built last Summer expressly for the coasting trade in the Gulf & now at Mobile, for $.4000, carrying about 450 Barrels. She is copper fastened & it would cost about $.500 to have her coppered, a measure essential to her preservation from the worms in this Bay.—If she had been owned by the United States it would have cost the Government about $.350 to have transported the Company of Artillery from St. Marks to this place, & a load of Stores to Tampa Bay whereas I
shall now pay $.1400 to the owner of the Shields for the same service.—
If the vessel alluded to had been in this port when I last chartered the Shields, I should have purchased her for the public service & trusted to you for an approval of the purchase.—
It is probable however that hereafter I shall be able to charter vessels on terms somewhat more reasonable than I have engaged the Shields for this voyage, but even that depends much upon the convenience of getting up the Bay & the facility of landing their Cargoes.”

<docbody>HON J C CALHOUN Secy of War SIR In pursuance of your instructions * I have the honor to state what has been done towards the completion of a project for the defence of the harbour of Pensacola—what plan should be adopted for the completion of the Works at Dauphin Island, should it be determined to resume the prosecution of them, and whether “the plan now pursued in the prosecution of the works at Mobile Point is the most practicable for the interest of the Government, and the speedy completion of the Work”
The Harbour of Pensacola has been examined by the Board of Engineers, and a Topographical Engineer under their instructions has made the surveys requisite to enable them to project the plans of defence; but he has been prevented from preparing the drawings of them, by other duties being pressed upon him to be fulfilled without delay, and the project, consequently, has not yet been commenced.”
The Topographical Engineer has been ordered to complete the drawings, and the Board of Engineers will be instructed to prepare the project as early as practicable.
Should it be determined to resume the works, at Dauphin Island, it would be advisable to complete the Quarters without delay, whereby the work already done to them, which might otherwise be lost, would be saved and a respectable temporary defence would be secured—
the Quarters by there peculiar construction, being calculated to serve as a Citadel or Reduit to the main Work. In this state the work would remain without injury should the means applicable to the fortifications on the Gulf of Mexico be limitted and their application to the works intended to guard the avenues to New Orleans be deemed of paramount importance—In that case it would be advisable, in addition to the Quarters or Citadel to finish the Salient Place of Arms, opposite the channel, which would be attended with but inconsiderable additional expense, and would admit of being established as a Battery for the temporary defence of the Channel, while it would itself be commanded and protected by the Citadel.
“The Plan now pursued in the prosecution of the works at Mobile Point” viz an officer of Engineers having them committed to his direction, and being held responsible for their faithfull execution, is that pursued at all the other works under construction, with the exception of those at Rigolets and Chef Menteur, and is believed to be
<pb#862 />
the most oeconomical and efficient. The work at Mobile Point was commenced under a Contract, in the belief, that it would be the most oeconomical manner of conducting it, but experience having proved, that it was not adapted to a section of Country of such limitted resourses as the frontier of the Gulf of Mexico, it was abandoned and the present plan was adopted. The work progresses satisfactoraly and it is not anticipated that any obstacle will prevent its completion as soon as the state of the appropriations will justify.

To the Honorable the Senate & House of representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.—
The Petition of Alexander Scott respectfully sheweth That your Petitioner was in June 1821 appointed Collector of the Port of Pensacola by the President of the United States who under the law authorizing him to take possession of the Florida's, allowed a Salary of one thousand dollars per annum to the several Collectors of Pensacola, S" Augustine and Saint Marks—
That your petitioner accepted the said appointment, and proceeded to Pensacola for the purpose of executing the duties thereof—That he has from that time continued to perform the duties of the said Office by himself or deputy, his son remaining there to act in his behalf, and the accounts being still kept in your petitioner's name.
That Congress by a law passed in May 1822 * gave a Salary of five hundred dollars a year to the respective Collectors of S*Augustine &
S’ Marks, but made no provision for a Compensation to the Collector of Pensacola—That the Commissions received by the Collector during the year 1822 amounted to ninety four dollars, and sixty five Cents, and during the same period his fees and emoluments amounted to ninety dollars and eighty six Cents, making in the whole one hundred
& eighty Dollars and fifty one Cents—
That no return of the fees and emoluments for the year 1823 has yet been received at the Treasury, but your petitioner beleives there is not much difference in the two years. Your Petitioners Salary allowed by the President ceased on the first of November 1822, since which period has received nothing but the trifling fees of the Office, out of which had to furnish his stationary and printing-Your Petitioner under these circumstances prays the Honorable Congress of the United States to take his case into consideration, and to allow
<pb#863 />
him such Salary as in their wisdom they may deem reasonable from the time his salary allowed by the President ceased during the period of his continuance in Officers Collector of the Port of Pensacola and your Petitioner as in duty bound shall &c &c.

<docbody>SIR. This is the first opportunity I have had of communicating to you my operations in this quarter—It was my intention to have addressed you from the interior; but it being the hunting season, when every day was valuable to the Indian, I found it impossible to employ an Individual, as an express, in whom confidence could be placed—
From the partial examination which I have made of the country assigned the Indians, I am inclined to the opinion that it contains a sufficient quantity of land, adapted to the purposes of agriculture, to support a much larger population than that acknowledged by the Florida Indians—It will notwithstanding be advisable, if not necessary, to extend the Northern boundary & I am the more disposed to recommend this extension as it may be done without allotting to the Indians any larger body of good land, or without encroaching upon any district inviting to a white population—The present Northern boundary is but a few miles from the Settlement of one of the principal chiefs while it runs within sight of the residence of another It encroaches upon what must be the grazing grounds for those settlements
& to the raising of cattle must these southern Indians in a degree resort—There country is not only better adapted for Stock of Cattle than anything else; but the Indians have already a disposition for that employment & cannot be easily reconciled to agricultural labors—
By extending the North line 5 or 6 miles a fine range for cattle is secured to the settlements of Meconope & Setarky; Those chiefs, now unfriendly, may be more reconciled to the terms of the Treaty; A
geographical boundary strongly marked may be obtained; & a Bend in the Amaxura River surrounded by swamps & ponds, but productive in a wild potatoe highly appreciated by the Indians will be embraced within the limits allotted them—I shall on my return mark the line
<pb#864 />
proposed & hope for the reasons stated that it will meet with the approbation of the Executive—
I have ascertained & marked the line as far as practicable to a point N° East of this & shall recommence my operations South tomorrow—The impoverished state of the Indians; the impracticability of packing liberal supplies of provisions for my party, & the time already lost in having to visit settlements for subsistence alone has rendered it necessary to charter a small vessel to proceed to Charlotts Harbor—I obtain her at a moderate rate & her presence in the Bay will afford me great facilities in running the line; & in exploring that district of country; a service I have considered as connected with my commission & not the least important part of it—I
hope by my movements South to ascertain the real character &
capabilities of a Country hitherto unknown, all of which will be submitted to you in a detailed report on my return—I have found the Indians friendly disposed in this vicinity & evidently much pleased with the prospects of establishments in this quarter from whence they may obtain supplies of the comforts & conveniences of life—A large number are expected to revisit this place on their return from hunting when Co' Brooke will explain at large to them the objects & views of the establishment of a Military Post on this Bay—I am confident they are well persuaded of their weakness or inability to contend successfully against the U States and are disposed to rely on the justice and magnanimity of the American government I arrived here on the 8 and Co' Brooke with a part of his detachment on the 20" instant, the remainder are in the Bay below & expected up this day—We have selected a point of land at the mouth of North Hillsborough river, at the head of the Bay of the same name as the site for the Military Post—The location is judicious as it regards the objects to be effected by a Military establishment in this quarter &
should it prove healthy it will be one of the most desirable Posts in the southern country—There is a small body of good Hammock land already cleared & well adapted for gardens at the spot; The Garrison may commence their agricultural labors immediately & be well supplied with vegetables this season—This circumstance, connected with the fact, that high undulating pine lands which have been traced for nine miles in the interior & approach to the very rear of the site, have induced a belief that it will prove healthy—If otherwise however the Troops may be removed & encamped for the sickly season in the Pine lands—It is prudent however in a Country of this lattitude & so little known to anticipate the worst & be prepared against every contingency—I would most strenuously recommend therefore a liberal supply of Hospital Stores & Two surgeons for the first year at least-
In the event of accident from sickness or death it will be recollected from the remote situation of this Post in a Wilderness that no resort
<pb#865 />
can be had to the medical talents of resident Physicians of neighbouring Settlements—The command are without artillery some few pieces of ordnance of small caliber may be important & a small vessel to enable the commanding officer to preserve an intercourse with the Depot at Pensacola untill the land communication is opened may be necessary—
I have assumed to myself the naming of the Cantonment, under a confident belief that that of Brooke will be approved of & confirmed by the Executive"—The prompt movement of Co" Brooke under the orders for establishing a Post at the Bay of Tampa * merits the notice of the Dep" of War—It is but little more than 2 months since the order alluded to was issued at Washington; & more than one third of that period was consumed in its passage to Pensacola *

<docbody>FONTAINE MAURY Esq Washington, Dr Sir, I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20" Nov.” enclosing your check for $134.23. and return you my thanks for your attention.
I have to day enclosed to the Secretary of State my account for the contingent expenses of my office in which is also included some disbursements which are payable out of the appropriation of $100,000.
for certain expenses in Florida. I hope that the balance of that appropriation has not yet been paid into the Treasury as I fear that in that event the payment of those items will be delayed. You will add to the many obligations I already feel to you by procuring the speedy settlement of those accounts and by remitting to me their amount in the most convenient mode to you.

SIR I have the honour to report that I left Pensacola with four full Companies on the 15" January last and arrived off the mouth Santo Spirituo Bay on the 18" but unfortunately was blown to Sea the Same evening by a Severe gale. The vessell on board of which I
was regained the Bay on the 20" the other two did not join untill some days afterward. On the twenty second met with Col Gadsden who had arrived some days previous and who had made a partial reconnoisance of the country but had not selected any particular spot.
On visiting several places, and after a consultation we determined on this place as the eligible regarding the objects of the expedition, health, * Meaning Nov. 19, 1823, ante, p. 792. 
<pb#867 />
and the conveniance of receiving supplies We were also influenced by the quantity of cleared land which was at once adapted to gardens for the officers and men. We are setuated on the Northeast bank of the Hillsborough river immidiately on its entrance into the Bay of the Same name a chart of the position is enclosed" Col G. did me the honour of insisting that the Contonment, should be called Brooke, but it will be known, by that of Hillsborough til the pleasure of the War Department shall be ascertained."
Immediately in the rear of this place say two miles, the ridge of piny lands commence in which I saw some very fine springs and should the slightest disease manifest it self we will retire on it with our tents.
I would beg leave to remark the neessity of having at least two Ass"
Sergions at all times here and an abondance of good Supplies. We are even at this time badly off for tents in consequence of our not being able to procure the necessary number from New Orleans, and those we took from Pensacola we all old with the exception of a few commen tents and we in the summer be compelled to move on the high land they will be absulately necessary There in the neighberhood of this place most excellent scite for a grist and saw mill which could be erected at a small expence provided the metirials were furnished as we have two fine millwrights in the command. It would not only be a great conveniance to the troops but would have a good effect on the Indians in grinding their corn and furnishing them with some plank and should the department ever wished to dspose of it. it would add very much to the value of the land I have no doubt but that, this country will be settled by emigrants from the southern States so soon as it is known they are protected from the Indians by the Command stationed at this place. There are very many large Hammocks of very fine land near us no doubt adapted to the Cultivation of Sugar and every variety of vegitable production. I have not as yet seen many Indians but expect to have a talk in a few days as I have Sent to the Chiefs. those whom I have seen do not appear to be well pleased with the treaty and have expressed some dislike to Colonel Gadsden’s runing the line.—They will be treated with Kindness and respect but at the same time with determination and firmness. It would have a good effect on the Indians if some of our vessels of War were ordered to look into this Bay frequently from Key West from which we are but a short distance. The Indians appear to have no Idea of the strength and power of the United States. Col G lift us two days since himself and party in good health upon his request I
furnished him with three additional men. The number of tents I
<pb#868 />
should wish forwarded will be fourteen Wall, two Hospital, and fourty Commen. By every Oppertunity I Shall furnish Such information as I may acquire of the Country and its resources, with such other matter as may be interesting to the Dep" of War.”

<place-time>PENSACOLA, 12” Feb'y. 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR; We some time since addressed a letter, through you to the President, recommending Mr M. Hunter, our present Secretary, as a suitable person to fill the vacancy in this Board of Commissioners.
Upon conversing with M. Hunter upon the subject, he appears to be entirely satisfied with his present situation, and prefers withdrawing his pretentions to the appointment proposed. Feeling the necessity of having the vacancy filled, we have, under these circumstances, taken the liberty of recommending Colo. John Miller of this place, to the attention of the President. We can testify to his honesty and intelligence, and have evry assurance, that he would harmonize with the present members of the Board, as well as inspire general confidence.—
<pb#869 />
The necessity of filling the existing vacancy in the Board, is suggested by the consideration, that it is now rendered probable, that we shall not be enabled to complete the duties of the Commission at as early a period as was some time since anticipated. Additional claims have been submitted for adjudication, and others will, no doubt, be filed as soon as it is known that our term is prolonged. Besides, it is possible that cases might be presented, upon which the present members of the Board should differ in opinion; in which event, we could only report the claims for the decision of Congress. Upon a consideration of all the circumstances connected with the subject, we are satisfied ourselves, of the necessity of making the proposed appointment.
It would, alternately, give some relief to the present members of the Board, provide a remedy for any division of opinion, and inspire additional confidence in our decisions, all which, however, is respectfully submitted.—
With evry sentiment of respect and esteem, we have the honor to be Y mo obt. Sevts.

<docbody>HON” JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, Secretary of State, SIR, I have the honor to enclose you a copy of a letter to Lieut. Co'
George M. Brooke;" Since this Letter was delivered to Co! Brooke I
have understood that a M. Hackley, who pretends to claim a part of the Duke of Alagon's Grant, is the person who has sent hands from the North to Tampa Bay for the purpose of cutting Timber.” Much
<pb#870 />
of the valuable timber on the Chocktawhache River has already been pillaged. I lately descended this River 50 or 60 miles, and observed that every Cedar tree near the river side had been cut and carried away within a year or two past. In passing through the interior of Florida I had an opportunity of examining particularly the Country.
The interior is, in my opinion, the most valuable Southern Country I
have ever seen. Between the Suwannee and Apalachicola Rivers I
estimate the good land at 1200000 acres. This region produces Sugar Cane and Sea Island Cotton in greater perfection than any other part of the Southern Country. The lands are uncommonly rich, and finely watered. The face of the Country is generally rolling, and in some parts mountainous. I have no doubt that this tract of Country alone will sell for more than the Florida Debt. There are no private Grants in this quarter, except the grant to Forbes & Co.; nine tenths of which is as poor as any lands in Florida. From the view which I
have had of Florida I state, without the fear of contradiction, that there is more good land in Florida than is to be found in Louisiana.

Three other Bridges have been built on the Road, & I find that the whole will cost more than my first estimate. $.208.50/100 has been expended on this Road; & the Bridge over the Big Bayou, if built, will cost in extra labor & the purchase of plank $.467.—I propose purchasing the plank, for I found by a calculation that I could have purchased that used for the other Bridges cheaper from the mill, than by the extra payment to the Sawyers employed.—

<docbody>HON SAMUEL L SOUTHARD Secretary of the Navy.
SIR, The Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, by an Act passed at their last session located their Seat of Government near St. Marks." The Council under the existing organick law are to meet the first of May next.
Believing it important to assembly them at the new Seat of Government, my arrangements are made for this object. Its execution must, however, depend on your disposition towards this Territory—
The public records and furniture, stationary &c of the Territory are at St. Augustine and this City; the Country will not admit of their transportation through it. If you can, without injury to the public service, order some small vessel to carry from St. Augustine and this place the Books, records, and public furniture belonging to the Territory to St. Marks, it would render us an essential service, and, at the same time prevent the Government from incurring a heavy expense. If you consider it proper to grant my request the vessel should be first sent
<pb#876 />
to St. Augustine to receive the property there, and, after discharging it at St. Marks, she should proceed to Pensacola, and ought to be here early in April.
Should you feel any doubt as to the propriety of granting this application, I request you will submit it to the President. Several of the officers of the Government have families and household furniture that cannot be removed except by water, and were they compelled to charter a vessel for the purpose it would be ruinous to them.
If however the public interest will not permit you to send a vessel, may I ask you to request the President to permit me to charter one for this purpose? I have written to Gen Call on this subject,” and requested him to obtain your answer as early as convenient.

PROCLAMATION.
WHEREAS in pursuance of an act of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, approved the 24th day of June 1823." Commissioners were appointed, to select the most eligible and convenient situation for the seat of government of the Territory of Florida, and the said Commissioners have reported to me that they have selected a scite in the County of Gadsden, situated “about a mile southwest from the old deserted fields of Tallahassé, about a half mile south of the Oke-lock-o-ny and Tallahassé, trail, at a point where the old
<pb#877 />
Spanish road is intersected by a small trail running southwardly.””
In the exercise of the discretion in me vested by the said act and for the information of the good people of this Territory, I have thought proper to issue this my Proclamation, requiring the members of the Legislative Council, of the Territory of Florida, to assemble at the scite above described, on the day appointed by law for the next session thereof.
Given under my hand and the seal of the said Territory at Pensacola, this 4th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty four and of the Independence of the United States of America the forty eighth.

<place-time>PENSACOLA, W. F. March 7" 1824.</place-time>
GENERAL, Believing that too long a time will elapse before my returns for the current Quarter can be completed and forwarded, for me afterwards to survey and mark out the road to Fort Mitchell, as directed in your order of 11* September last,” for you to receive my report in time to obtain an appropriation for opening it, if that is intended, I have deemed it most proper for me to state at Once such facts respecting it as I know, and shall postpone the survey until I again hear from you on the subject. I am fully aware of the necessity of implicit obedience to the orders of a Superior in rank;
and in this case should not have ventured thus long to delay this
<pb#878 />
duty, but since my return from St. Augustine I could not possibly have performed it without wholly neglecting my other duties. Having travelled over more than half of this route directly along the trail, and crossed it at various other points, I am perfectly acquainted with the Country through which it must pass, and, moreover, believe myself to be as well qualified to make a correct estimate of the expense, and also to open it, if required, as if I had previously surveyed and marked it out.—Two Routes present themselves from Pensacola, first, via Fort Crawford up the west side of the Conecuh River, crossing it at “Schurlock's ferry,” (12 miles from the Fort,) and Second, to cross the Head of the Escambia Bay at Florida, (Beeler's ferry,) and thence up the Pensacola Path. Both these routes would unite, East of the Conecuh, about five miles from Schurlock's ferry.
The first mentioned route is perhaps from 5 to 10 miles farther than the second; but nevertheless, is, I think, decidedly to be preferred, because of the difficulty of the wide Ferry at the head of the Bay:—
If the road to St. Augustine had crossed at the Head of the Bay, the junction of the two roads at this point would have caused a good ferry to be kept up, which cannot now be expected Both of these routes are now tolerably good waggon Roads, (as good, if not better, than the mail road from this to Claiborne,) for the distance of one hundred miles. There is a waggon Road also from Fort Mitchell along this route for 25 or 30 miles, when it turns off to the right into the Settlements lying between the Conecuh and the “Federal Road”, leaving only about 50 miles which is not already travelled by wagons.
There are settlements along the road or trail for 100 miles from Pensacola, after which there are no more immediately upon the trail until within five miles of Fort Mitchell, at the Uchee Bridge, where it ought to intersect the Federal Road. The distance from Pensacola, via Claiborne, to Fort Mitchell is about 290 miles, & by the proposed direct route will not exceed 180 miles. There will be a Bridge over each to build at the Burnt corn creek, & murder Creek, (near Fort Crawford,) and also three Small Bridges over the head Branches of Pea River. The whole of this route is uninterrupted by Swamps, or any Streams of size excepting the Conecuh River; and is from Schurlock's Ferry a high pine ridgeway, being the dividing ridge between the waters of Yellow water & Pea River on the East and the Conecuh on the West. A good Road can be completed on this route in almost the same time that it would take to survey and mark it out; and I am of opinion that if a detail of one Lieutenant, one Sergeant, two Corporals & 24 men from the 4* Inf: was placed under my orders for the purpose I could open it in the early part of the Summer, without any detriment to their health, as the whole route is a dry pine barren; and also without adding any material burden to the general expenses of the Quarter Master's department at this
<pb#879 />
Station. I have on hand 3 Yoke of oxen which are not now necessary for the public service here, as I can more than supply Teams in their Stead by the mules purchased last fall for the Survey; and I
calculate upon retaining both oxen & mules in service in any event,-
unless otherwise ordered,—as they will be indispensably necessary in working upon the road to St. Augustine, and it is difficult to purchase well-broke oxen & mules. I estimate the expense of opening this Road at $.2130,—for Extra pay to Soldiers, and the transportation of provisions & forage; and $.300 for the purchase of two waggons.
The cost of the forage could hardly be considered as an extra expense, as it must be provided for the public cattle if unemployed; and I
should use them for the principal part of the transportation and other work on the Road."—
I have the honor to be Sir, with, perfect respect Yr Mo. Ob. Serv"

<place-time>[Referred March 8, 1824]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Congress of the United States, the memorial of the subscribers sheweth, that before the cession of Florida to the United States, the Indians within the limits of the Territory, too numerous and powerful to be kept in restraint by the weak government of S* Augustine, were in the constant habit of stealing, or enticing away the slaves of the people of Florida, as well as those of the adjacent states; The negroes, once arrived within the Indian boundary, were either made slaves of, by the Indians or admitted to roam at large as free persons;
and in this situation were many fugitives from your memorialists, at the cession in 1821. Your memorialists when that event took place, when they were admitted to the protection of the laws of a powerful and wise government, flattered themselves, that their property would no longer be with held from, but the Indians would be compelled to surrender to their proper owners the runaway negroes among them—As yet however the hope of your memorialists has not been realized—Application was made to the commissioners appointed to treat with the Florida Indians, to provide for the restoration of slaves among them, by treaty, but for some cause unknown to your
<pb#880 />
memorialists the Commissioners refused to introduce any provision for them into the treaty—They then applied to Co." Humphreys, the Agent for Florida Indians, but he also declined any interference—
Your memorialists therefore relying upon the justice of the Gov" beg leave to call the attention of Congress to their situation, and pray that a special Tribunal may be created to decide between them and the Indians, or that they may be releived in any other way that Congress may deem expedient—and your memorialists as in duty bound will ever pray.

<place-time>PENSACOLA March 10th 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR—In the newspaper published at this place and notoriously under the direction or control of M" Steel the district attorney of West Florida, there is a pargraph which purports to be a report of some proceedings in the Superior Court of which I am the judge. It is calculated to produce a very unfavorable impression against me in the minds of those who are unacquainted with the facts. I am represented as having pocketted some presentments of a publick nature made by the Grand Jury and refusing to place them on the records of the court.
Feeling conscious of my innocence, I should not have troubled you with the matter, as I am satisfied you must have been already much importuned by the petty dissentions which have unfortunately prevailed here, but that M Steel, has, I, understand, circulated a report that the presentments thus said to have been withheld by me, form the groundwork of charges against him on account of his official conduct. Under these circumstances I consider it my duty to give an explanation.
From the moment M Steel commenced his official carreer at this place, he unfortunately gave much dissatisfaction to almost every one in any way connected with him. It is impossible for me to give an account of his strange, and unaccountable deportment. I possess neither inclination, nor skill to trace the picture; suffice it say, that in spight of every disposition to be indulgent to him, first on the score of his being a stranger, and next as holding a respectable commission, it became my duty to reprimand him at almost every moment, and at length with some severty in the case of Reily. In this case, after urging his motions in a most unbecoming manner, when I decided against him verbally, he insisted upon my reducing my decision to writing; and in complying with this request, I took occasion to express my disapprobation of his conduct, in the hope that it would produce a salutary effect; and on this occasion, having said that he meant no disrespect to the court or to the Grand Jury, I observed, that if that were the case, I should not give my opinion to the Clerk to be filed with the papers in the cause; but he declined observing that he wished to address something in writing. His refusal to accept of this offer to consign the matter to oblivion, by striking out of my opinion the part of it which censured him, satisfied me that his temper was perverse and obstinate. I of course declined receiving anything from him writing; and greatly to my astonishment, I afterwards saw in the newspaper, a paper which purported to be one that had been communicated to me, containing a most unfair account of the preceeding transaction, at the same time reflecting upon the conduct of the Grand
<pb#883 />
Jury, and of a Mr Williams a member of the bar," to all of whom, as well as to myself, he was an entire stranger. From that time, until the last September court, publications frequently appeared, in which the conduct of many of the most respectable persons was implicated.
These were well known to be the productions of M. Steel. With the exception of a very small number of persons, the community was much displeased, and when the Grand Jury, at the last mentioned term came into court and were asked whether they had any further business, and answering in the negative, were about to be discharged, they observed that they had still something before them of a general nature. After having retired about an hour, they returned, and the forman presented me sealed paper with my address, and opening it I found it consisted of something like an address to me, of a complimentary character, and a vindication of the former Grand Jury and myself from the newspaper publications before mentioned. M Steel ensisted, in a very rude and indecorous manner, upon seing the paper—I stated to him that it had nothing to do with his official duties, and when he ensisted again, in the afternoon upon my delivering the paper to him, I stated to him what it contained, and told him that in the score of delicacy, if for no other reason, it did not become me to give publicity to such a document he still ensisted, when the explanation ought to have satisfied any one, and nothing was left to me but to punish him for his improper conduct, or to order him peremptorily to be silent. I chose the latter, particularly as he was then in a situation, in which unfortunately, he has been too often seen, and which did not allow him that calm exercise of discretion which he might possess on other occasions. I most unfair account of the transaction is contained in the pretended report, to which I have alluded in the commencement of this letter, which has only appeared six months after it took place, and when it might have been supposed that the presentment, was thrown away by me or lost.
But it remained in my possession, and very reluctantly I have been compelled in my own defense to publish it. At the time,—I spoke to the forman and some of the Grand Jury individually, and told them I
disapproved of it, and desired that it might not be published, as it would do more harm than good. Besides it might very naturally be said that I had been instrumetal in procuring such a paper, to sustain myself against those who were displeased by my conduct. Indeed when the document shall be exhited, the reasons for the course I
pursued will suggest themselves most obviously.
I have no intention to add any weight to the complaints made against M. Steel by individuals. I have nothing to do with them.
What I have done has been to enclose the letters, or representations of M. Scott, to me as the Judge of the Superior Court;" and to add
77 John Lee Williams.
<pb#884 />
my opinion respecting the official conduct of M. Steel, and his want of capacity. This opinion has been confirmed by every thing which has come under my observation since. With the motives of M. Scott at the time I had nothing to do. M. Scott had been his client, and very shortly before this they had quarrelled about the compensation demanded by M. Steel for his services; and a suit was instututed before me, but dismissed. I viewed M. Scott merely as the agent of the government, as the deputy collector, and the fact which he stated in his communication alone induced me to notice it. I consider it due to truth to say, and I hope the observation may not be deemed improper, the conduct of neither of these persons has been such as to receive the esteem of the community in which they live; and in my own opinion the Attorney is not the worst man of the two, for, very often I am unable to find a motive even in the most mischeveus and vexatious of his acts, but rather some strange calenture of the intellect.
I am informed that M. Steel has ascribed his misfortunes here, in part to some supposed enmity entertained by me against him. Such a feeling I disclaim, the imputation has even induced me to err by extending to him on many occasions, an indulgence which under other circumstances, would be scarcely warranted. A county court was lately held by Judge Bowie, in which according to the territorial law, M. Steel is also prosecutor, and his conduct was much more severely censured by that judge, than it ever had been by me. This was a common remark. The existence of unfriendly feelings on my part towards him, is certainly, in itself highly improbable unless excited by something offensive in his own conduct. But this will not account for his variance with so many individuals upon so many occasions, and I am informed that in Georgia where he formerly resided, his situation was no less unfortunate than it has been here. I could feel for him, if I could but see him feel for himself; and I really feel on account of his family and connections who are highly respectable, and who I fear are unhappily doomed to see a most lamentable termination to the carreer of this young man.”
I am, Sir, with sentiments of respect Your most obed S'

<place-time>PENSACOLA 10* March 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, But a short interval has elapsed since I had the honor of addressing you in relation to the Conduct of the District Attorney of West Florida.” Since that time for the same subject matter, after three successive attempts to indict me before three different Grand Juries for interfering to part combattants, he had me again arrested and preferred two other Bills against the Young Gentlemen and myself, which as to me were again returned “not found,” and against them returned into Court with several blanks, which the Attorney afterwards illegally filled up without permission of the Grand Jury or Court, for which he has been taken up, examined and committed for trial at the next Term of the Court for falsifying the Record.
These indictments were again quashed for informality by the County Court. I now enclose Your Excellency several Affidavits going to support the charges heretofore forwarded, and a number of others.
It may be proper to remark, that however gross or improper may be the conduct of an Officer, the Community unless outraged in the extreme feel reluctant in preferring charges or giving affidavits. It is stated in the Newspaper here, that the charges are not sanctioned by the Community: this is a direct falsehood, and it is proper to remark that this Paper has been in the hands of M" Steele, or under his controul and in which he has endeavoured to injure the best men in the Country by the grossest misrepresentations of facts, until the Community became so indignant as to prostrate it. I again refer Your Excellency to the papers in your possession and to the accompanying Documents from the most respectable men in this Country and to submit them to the high consideration of His Excellency the President of the United States.” I have to offer an apology for calling your attention to matters so insignificant, but the repeated improprieties and outrages of an Officer so disgraceful to himself and the Government, have imperiously prompted me so to do. His conduct throughout has been marked by so many eccentricities and improprieties, that the most soberminded and charitably disposed have come to the conclusion, that his reason was impaired, while others of acuter discernment, without impeaching this opinion, have gone into a closer analysis, and found that malignity was the distinguishing trait of his Character. Be this as it may, the effects have been equally deleterious.”

<place-time>US Attorneys office, WEST FLORIDA 12" March 1824–</place-time>
SIR By the mail of the preceding week * I had the honor to inform you that I had received a communication from Gen Call the Delegate to Congress from this Territory which apprised me of the fact of several charges having been preferred at the Department of State, against me for my official conduct,” & I then stated that I would endeavor to forward a proper despatch on the subject by the succeeding mail.” I proceed Sir to perform that duty with the hope that its result may prove to the Government not only that I am undeserving such an attack upon me as that which has been essayed, but that my destruction has been wantonly attempted by a combination of persons, some of whom, (if the suppositions of the publick here as to the individuals be correct) should have been by their stations, if not feelings far, far aloof from such a proceeding.—That the attempt has begun & progressed in the most extreme malice is here well known by my most respectable fellow citizens & that the wish for my removal exists only in the bosoms of a few illiberal designing interested or unprincipled men (within the limits of this city) I may with perfect safety declare to be the truth of the matter.—The single fact that until the charges were heard of from Washington, no respectable, impartial or independent citizen here knew of the charges or the application for my removal, that the publick were totally ignorant of the attempt must alone stamp the application with a most suspicious aspect, I
trust Sir that the time has not yet arrived or ever will come when the secret machinations of a few invidious, illiberal or unjust men, (whether citizens or officers) can in the United States effected the removal of an officer who has sought to discharge his duty with stern impartiality, & who possesses the confidence of the worthier part of the community.
This last phrase Sir it is conceded, (as being spoken of myself) were inexcusable in any man save one upon his defence and thus wantonly
<pb#887 />
assailed & who has been gratified by the cordial assurances of many of his fellow citizens to the above effect. I shall endeavor Sir so far as my ignorance of my individual assailants at Washington & the vague nature of some of the charges will permit, to make such an exposition of the incidents of my official career as may be satisfactory & as may be (what I trust it will appear) a sufficient vindication. A few remarks Sir by way of explanation are necessary ere I advert specially to the points with which the Delegate has possessed me. On my arrival at this place in the early part of the last year, I found upon observing the state of society that the mass of the population of this city & its neighborhood, (being French & Spanish) & of those not many of the higher order) entertained all those crude indefinite notions of American laws, and institutions, which characterized the people of Louisiana upon its first acquisition by the U States. Seldom interfered with by the Spanish government for any, save political offences, or if noticed received an award of summary (& not often severe) justice by the mandate of a Governor or escaping with impunity the denunciations of their laws through the connivance of officers; the change of the government was to them an immense one as to the laws. In consequence (as might have been anticipated)
when an offender was arrested and with all the deliberation known to our laws (to a stranger so unpleasing, unusual, & so apparently unnecessary, was held to answer for an offence—which might have been before deemed venial, or have been readily compounded, it was regarded as oppression, & the mass of the foreign or rather the adopted population considered themselves aggrieved individually as well as collectively. This state of things rendered the officer of the law who was the necessary medium of its operation almost inevitably unpopular with those who from their education or the want of it, comprehended not his duties or who by their defaults had subjected themselves to prosecutions.—Again Sir the depredations committed upon the publick domain by the destruction of its timber made it necessary for the Attorney to take some active measures by the seizure of a vessel and cargo in one instance, & the prosecutions of trespassers in person in another, which added to the former feeling among that portion of the community who had ere this proceeded without hindrance in their destruction of the publick property. Again as to the selections of Grand Juries by the Marshal from the only two classes from which he thought proper to obtain them—First those of the city, adopted citizens of the Union, foreigners by birth, education & feeling, in almost every instance, or on the other hand from the class of population located upon the abandoned Spanish grants, or the unsurveyed publick lands in the upper parts of the County in which this City stands.—
The former, unfitted by the prejudices of education, & the latter (the usual class of settlers on publick lands) having (with scarcely an excep-
301867-57–56
<pb#888 />
tion) never had the honor to serve upon a Grand Inquest in the States of the Union from which they had migrated, and being alike unacquainted with the duties of a Grand Juror, or the laws by which those bodies are governed. Among both these classes however, were a few respectable impartial, intellegent Americans, & adopted citizens who were proper Jurors, who yet were so seldom summoned & then in so small a number that their weight was never felt in that body & this result proceeding from the neglect of the Marshall to summon from the different parts of the District, as prescribed by law, so as to secure impartial proceedings, but taken to suit his convenience from the particular county of his residence, & sometimes from the Town of Pensacola itself, as for instance the Grand Jury at the May Term 1823
of the US Sup” Court for W Florida (of which body John Innerarity was appointed the Foreman by the Court) which Jury was composed of citizens or persons from within the limits of the city of Pensacola, with one individual exception; and then the expression of a Grand Jury thus selected, is attempted to be passed upon the publick, and the Government as a Grand Jury of the District of West Florida speaking the language of the hearts of the people of that District : a course which cannot but excite great surprise. Last but not least Sir in addition to the general causes of which I have spoken, & which would have affected any individual holding the office of US Attorney for this District, there was yet another cause which of itself might well have produced a most harsh feeling upon the publick mind in relation to the present incumbent of that office, upon whom the before named general influences were acting. This Sir was nothing more or less than the settled and determined hostility of the highest Judicial officer in the District, the Judge of the highest Court in which that incumbent acted as prosecutor, & this enmity encountered upon all occasions in court, & out of court, originating without cause & progressing without reason, except indeed sufficient reason were found in the opposition made (in discharge of his duty) by that officer to the decisions of that Judge, in cases where they were deemed not to be supported by the laws. With this unqualified & decided censure of a high officer of the Bench, it would not therefore have been a matter to excite surprise, if the publick disapprobation were indeed lavishly bestowed upon the U S Attorney, but even with all these operating causes in aid, the object has not been attained, & the prejudices existing against the Attorney exist (happily) only in this city, & among a comparative few, & the Attorney appeals with confidence to the feelings existing among the most respectable Americans of the country, as well as the more enlightened & worthy of the adopted citizens to prove the approbation and respect in which he stands with the community. If he could have condescended to solicit from the Grand Jury at the late November
<pb#889 />
Term their presentment in favor of his official conduct, asserting their belief of his uprightness & integrity of official deportment, it would have been readily procured by him, & have enabled him to thwart the secret designs of his secret enemies, who succeeded by positive misrepresentation to deceive that Grand Jury into the finding of a presentment which was entirely groundless, & which yet was never for a moment intended by that body to indicate an ill opinion of the general conduct or character of the Attorney.—Yet Sir in reference to this last fact, it is not intended in this place, to enter into a series of elaborate proofs on this occasion, to establish the position that the present Attorney of the U States for West Florida, is a temperate, moral, or virtuous man and not wholly [MS. illegible]. If the representations of nearly all the Senatorial & Representative Members of Congress from two States New Jersey & Georgia, of the highest Judiciary officers, and nearly all the Legislative Body of the latter State, together with the special expressions of confidence in him made by some, nay numbers of the most worthy & distinguished among the citizens of that State, after an acquaintance of years; if all these testimonials
(which it is presumed are to be found in the archives of the Department of State of the US) have been insufficient to establish the positions taken in the said documents it would seem the height of folly to seek on this occasion the evidence of a few gentlemen here by whom the Atty has been known for a few months. And indeed Sir upon reflection it becomes to the writer a matter of surprise, when considering his official course in Florida, that with the influence of the Judge and other official gentlemen, (exerted upon all occasions), added to his uniform strictness with offenders which have produced such high prejudices with a particular class; it is a matter of surprise that (with these conjoined causes moving), a presentment of a Grand Jury has not been obtained against the publick Attorney which might vie in mildness & justice with the opinion of the court in the case of Reilly.
I trust Sir I shall be excused for this prolixity of prefatory remark, since it became necessary in order that the President should fully understand the proceedings hereafter alluded to in this defence.—
To assume then the order adopted by Genl Call in his communication to me, I will in the first place, remark Sir on the case of the Thos Shields for a violation of the laws of the U States regulating the transportation of slaves.—In this case upon the application of the collector Mr Scott, to request me to proceed on the part of the U States, I had not then, nor have ever intended, to express the idea that in cases of pecuniary forfeitures under a statute, where qui tam actions” are given (as in the case in question) that the U States could not proceed
<pb#890 />
alone for the penalty, by an information filed in the usual way; I
intended not so to express myself in answer to the collector's note tho' I find that the haste with which that answer was written (by casualty) led me into a style of looseness of phrase & general expression which may very fairly bear such a construction. The intended meaning of the doubt therein expressed whether the Coll" or rather
“Attorney could sue officially” was merely under the existing circumstances of that case which had been fully understood by the collector
& myself in conference that morning, but for which my note would note would not have been so little explicit.—The state of facts understood between the Collector—& myself was firstly that no offence had been intended, if one had really been committed, secondly that it was made fully to appear to us or at all events to the Attorney &
was afterwards fully shewn to the Coll" by the testimony of Mr Davison whose affidavit is transmitted (Document No 1) that the Inspector of the Customs had actually given verbal permission to land the negros, & that they had been regularly cleared from New Orleans, the manifest and permits there being full & regular, & that the slaves were & had been from the period of their landing under the verbal permit aforesaid, in readiness to attend the Collector & to comply with the law formally, which he however declined. Under all these circumstances, believing that no offence whatever was committed, and knowing that a qui tam action could be filed in the case by any other person equally well as by himself—the Attorney deemed it competent for him to exercise a legal discretion in declining to take an official proceeding in behalf of the U States alone, in a case where he believed the spirit of the law had been complied with. The Attorney deemed it at all events quite competent for him (“without seeking to assume the judicial garb”) to decline taking such official proceeding in a case, in its nature so highly penal, until some legal evidence of the commission of the offence was before him by affidavit
&c, which however was never offered in the case. It was believed that the mere official notice of any functionary (however respectable)
was not a sufficient ground for the procedure under the circumstances.—The state of facts above recited (& which but for a full conversation between the Coll & Attorney which had just preceded)
would have appeared in the note of the Coll & Attorney—present the case simply thus that as Attorney of the U States he intended to be understood to declare that he declined filing an information in the particular case in question for the U States alone, & under the special circumstances, until evidence laid before him, should have made it an imperious duty. Perhaps however the opinion was incorrect &
that the official note of the collector was sufficient to compel or justify the taking an official procedure; if so I must regret the error but trust
<pb#891 />
that a wrong apprehension of my discretionary power to the extent spoken of in the filing prosecutions of this nature, may not be considered as an overwhelming fault. I must ask here to be permitted to remark that if every official suggestion made to me by an officer—
stating the commission of an offence shall justify my official act in the institution of suits of this nature, I should from the not unfrequent intimations of this kind (had I always acted upon them) have produced against myself a charge of official tyranny vastly more well grounded than the one of this nature already preferred. As respects the execrable traffic which the law was intended to prevent I
trust that as an American I need hardly say that no man feels more disposed to witness its extinction & aid in that object—Next Sir as to the Judge's “Opinion” in the case of the U S vs Riley, I beg leave to refer to the affidavit (Document N° 2) of Co! William Barnett, in time past a Member of Congress from the State of Georgia & one of the leading republicans of his day in that State, a man of Roman firmness and more than Roman virtue.—The affidavit proves distinctly that ere the Attorney had been in the Territory one short month (having arrived in April) and before his becoming more than passingly acquainted with Judge Brackenridge or had appeared in his court as a publick officer that his hostility (which I was to feel so heavily) had commenced & in a way too the most ungenerous &
cruel, & that it still exists bitterly (as the enclosed affidavit (N° 3
with N° 13 in contrast) will shew) is here well understood. That this enmity has been increased by my earnest opposition to many of the decisions of the Judge illegal as the one now forwarded (par exemple)
is more than probable, but the manner of that opposition has been ever guided by principles of law and of courtesy," and has never furnished him with the shadow of excuse. As to the opinion of the Court I can only say that it was pronounced in high passion, and appeared to be intended as a declamation at the time, since the Judge upon the Protest entered by the U. S. Attorney as to the Statement of facts, and the most unmerited abuse contained therein did immediately offer to withdraw the opinion if the Attorney would make an apology;
to which it was replied that no apology could be given, where there was nothing to atone for, but that an answer would be filed, or handed to the Bench, which it was hoped might cause the very unjust opinion to be withdrawn: the Judge assented, & afterwards received the answer then refused to read it, or to withdraw the opinion which opinion was placed on file, tho never upon the Records of the Court. The answer—
the copy of which is herewith transmitted (document N°4) is deposited in the office of the Clerk—It contains the law as the Attorney believed it to exist in Florida, there being no restricting Statute as in some of the States of the Union. The paper (N° 5.) containing the Oath, * From this point this document is written in a hand other than Steele's, 
<pb#892 />
Warrant & recognizance are forwarded & it is only regretted that the absence of Col. Humphreys prevents my obtaining his affidavit to prove the facts connected with the immediate delivery of the opinion, & the offer to receive an apology, & which shall at some future Period be transmitted.—I may perhaps properly state here that Reily sold the horses the next day after his discharge, to some Citizens in the Presence & within in the knowledge of the Judge.—
In regard Sir to my official conduct as the Publick prosecutor
(to which Gen Call next alludes as a charge) I can only say that I
have in conformity to the best dictates of my Judgment, & convictions of duty sought to act in all criminal Prosecutions as became a vigilant officer & a humane Man. If official Zeal & the assurance of my mind that the Punishment of an offender was important to the Publick Welfare, has ever carried me too far, it has ever been a mistake in regard to my duty, & need I add at no time from a wish to oppress or tyrannize. In the case of the Terry v Grandpre, & the Coulons
(which is the only one mentioned by Gen Call—I always believed their conviction & punishment to be important as the riot was an outrageous one, & excited great Publick indignation at the time.
The enclosed Documents (N° 6 & 7.) being the evidence taken before the Magistrates upon which I have always proceeded will shew whether offences of no very trivial character were not committed by the Parties named, & whether it was not my duty to prosecute them to conviction. I have never believed because Judge Brackenridge has thought proper to screen the offenders by repeatedly quashing the bills (as I have always thought illegally) after their being repeatedly found by Successive Grand Juries.—I have never beleived I repeat that it was my duty to neglect the Prosecutions for this reason. The Papers (N° 8 & 9.) shew the Indictments at the May Term against these Parties and the grounds upon which they were quashed in several of the cases in which it appeared clearly to the Attorney that the Parties should have been held to answer and not have been discharged in the Summary mode adopted, which is contrary clearly to the continued practice of other Courts.—That I have been lenient to these parties will appear from the enclosed paper
(N° 10.) where an application was made to me after the May Term, to waive the recognizance to enable them to leave the Country, which was readily complied with, but as they remained, & were as daring &
ferocious as formerly (being thorough Spaniards in the worst traits of that people)—I deemed it my duty to proceed against them when they were again & again protected by the Judge's decisions to quash—
to which movement Col. Barnets affidavit affords the only clue as I
have thought. The only other prominent cases which I recollect
& which can have found their way to Washington to be handled by
<pb#893 />
my Assailants—are those of Mess" Myers & Parmentier. In those cases I had believed the evidence fully sustained the Bills, & that they must be found: but the Bills were resent to the Grand Jury on account of important additional evidence. Altho’ I have ever as a publick officer deemed it competent for me to resend a bill of Indictment to a Grand Jury where I have beleived they clearly mistook the law—, or the evidence, which has happened in my experience here more than once or twice & been conceded by the Jury.—when bills have been resent by request—The paper (N° 11.) is a brief of evidence (in the case upon the Civil docket) which was agreed upon
& filed by Counsel & it was upon this & other evidence that the bills were prefered to the Grand Jury I have desired Alex Scott Esq.
of Georgetown, who has the deposition of the Witnesses in this matter to have them deposited in the Department of State to be used in the present investigation. It has always appeared to myself that the only reasons why the bills were not found was that John Innerarity was at the head of the Grand Jury & that so many foreigners or rather adopted Citizens were upon the Jury—As regards this part of the charges—there being no specification of other cases I conclude by saying, that I beleived always & now, that I have sought to perform my duty in every prosecution—as to the Note Signed “J. Innerarity Foreman) which was handed in by that character to the Court &
which was intended as a return on the Bills or a Note of Conversation to the Court—it was instantly rejected and a return made upon the Bills in open Court—The note was then Surreptitiously placed upon the Records, & on my discovering it during the Term—it was upon my Motion ordered to be expunged from the records as a paper which was very improperly placed upon it—which paper as I learn has been forwarded to Washington as a recorded Presentment.
From the numerous charges against John Innerarity for offences committed—and his misconduct during the Term inducing the Jury to refuse Bills without examining a Witness upon them—from his being
& from his having been discharged by his own consent from the Grand Jury and a new Foreman appointed & sworn & his then resuming his seat I felt it my duty to move for his discharge as Foremanthis the Court promptly overruled & he was detained to reject the Bills against Myers—and to endeavor to effect a presentment against myself. A Bill for swindling was then upon my Desk against him which was amply supported & the hostility which he has always shewn * has arisen as I am convinced from his being criminally chargeable in many transactions here. I will hereafter take leave to say a single word with regard to him & dismiss him.— |
As to the last matter mentioned by Genl Call to me as being charged vizimmoral & disorderly conduct, as I before observed I can not think
<pb#894 />
it proper or useful to seek out affidavits or certificates to disprove this one of the numerous falsities attempted with reference to me. With respect to the alleged Presentments at the November Term of the Super Court, I refer to the paper (No 12) where the presentments will be seen in full & also the order to quash, which was taken immediately upon their being returned into Court & before they could be considered as having been even filed.—The Court being convinced from the universal knowledge of the facts here, that even with its wish to sustain them, it was impossible to do so with safety gave the order aforesaid.—The facts upon which both the presentments
(in which appears the name of the U S Attorney appears) were as follows: on the night of the twenty fifth of october last a festive party was convened at the house of Genl Richard K. Call in Pensacola—
when the gentlemen (among whom were the most respectable in W
Florida civil & military) who were present became in the event over joyous with their libations and perhaps somewhat too resonant in their notes of mirth & on their return homeward without having committed the slightest illegal act, but only sonorous in their merriment without molesting thing or creature were assailed by a party of constables who sought to imprison them, the writer W F Steele among the number, but considering the measure rather too high handed they eventually desisted & suffered the gentlemen to proceed to their houses. A malicious individual of the assailant party who went before the Grand Jury endeavored to marshal witnesses enough to induce a presentment, & from the positive swearing upon the occasion, the Grand Jury felt themselves bound to return a presentment, from a vague & mistaken belief that some offence had been proved to have been committed. The other Presentment against the District Attorney alone was equally malicious and unfounded as it was charged upon a converse upon the subject of the previous occurrence, and was utterly false as will be perceived by the affidavit (No 13) of M” W Davison herewith sent. And the deponent M D is a man as–Genl Jackson & Genl Call will readily establish to be fully relied upon. It remains only to observe Sir as to this that the Presentments were never even placed upon the Records of the Court but were destroyed before they were even lodged in office, & the Clerks certificate annexed N° 12 shews that these are the only ones ever made in this Court in which the Attorney's name was incorporated.—
The last paper Sir (N° 14) is one of no trivial character, being a free will offering at the hands of the three Gentlemen who have signed their names & who have been successively Foreman of the Grand Juries with whom I have acted. Mr Allen at Septr Special Term, Mr Lavalle at the Novr Term, and Mr Twitchell at the late Term of the County Court in February—But four Grand Juries have been panelled since my residence here & the three last named
<pb#895 />
gentlemen were the presiding officers of three of them & the Foreman of the fourth jury (whose name is not present) I need only add was John Innerarity.—
And I will beg leave Sir here to refer to the names of Genl Jackson
& Genl Call at Washington to whom I am instructed to refer for the character of John Innerarity, as well as the standing of Mr Davison and the worthy Foremen of the Grand Juries already named. I
believe Sir that it may be said with safety that except for my enemy the Judge (Brackenridge) & his party of guards with John Innerarity at their head, that there are not beside those ten respectable men in the District who would even wish for my removal.—As to who my accusers at Washington are, I can only conjecture who they may be.—If it be Judge Brackenridge—his feelings to me are proved by Col Barnett &c & in various ways—If it be John Innerarity I need not say what reliance should be placed upon him.—The Commissioners Messrs White & Overton have thought proper also to be at open war with me for opposing the exaction of fees & which it would seem the Congress of the U States have declared by their bill at this session to be unjustifiable.—I need only to conclude then by expressing my hope that official weight may not be added to any think charged upon me by these same gentlemen.—I refer with confidence to my fellow citizens for my conduct and standing, and if I am removed, I shall be able Sir to refer to my bosom for that support which shall save me from mental prostration.—
I had nearly Sir omitted one other subject which demands my attention. It is this that at the late Term of the County Court for this County upon the return of a Bill of Indictment against the Messrs Coulons, two blanks as to the alias dictus" of the christian name were filled up by myself as matter of form in the first instance
& as I then & still believe it to be, but afterwards supposing it might be by cavillers deemed matter of substance was re-submitted to the Grand Jury. The Bill was however quashed by the Court (Doct No 15 & 16) upon the ground that the alteration was made after the bill had been first returned & altho by grand Jury's consent, it avoided the Bill. The Judge of the Court took much care to express himself distinctly that the Attorney was perfectly in order to amend if he believed it form (as the Court would in such case always assent)
and that no censure could be possibly attached to that officer Nevertheless an affidavit was procured to be sworn by one of the young Spaniards Coulons & a prosecution set on foot against the Attorney for forging & defacing the Record—a charge and accusation which may afford an apt illustration of the fiend like malice which marks the course of a few men here to the Attorney of the US—this last
<pb#896 />
affair (as is believed) having been arranged to effect at Washington what they supposed their previous accusations might fail to accomplish—ie my removal. The examination was had before the justice one John L. Williams who made out the process of arrest & who was prosecuted at the last named Term of the Court for a Perjury, and who now stands indicted at the last Super Court for two most aggravated assaults and batteries, one of them done upon a publick officer avowedly for the discharge of his official duty & these offences committed while the s” Williams was acting in the commission as Justice of the Peace—The annexed papers (N° 17, 18, 19) are furnished as it is understood that the accounts of this wicked affair have been sent to Washington.—The statements here sent are one of the Foreman who presided at the Grand Jury when the bill alluded to was found, the other is that of a Jury man who was with the Foreman & the last a letter from the Judge of the County who succeeded the Judge who presided when the bill was quashed.—These papers exhibit mostly the course of the proceeding but that of the Judge—(Buoy which will be forwarded next week will be as I presume a most ample refutation of this villainy—Mr White as the Attorney for the Coulons, Mr Innerarity as their brother in law and Judge Brackenridge as their friend appear to the publick here as the movers, but such circumspection is had in their proceedings in this dangerous matter that clear proof is not wholly attainable I conclude Sir with the expression of my hope & almost belief that in this attempt of my enemies they will have made eventually as says the Psalmist their own tongue to fall upon themselves”.—I trust Sir that if I have in my earnestness of defence overlooked that deference which became me on the occasion or have omitted aught of that polish of conduct which might have been expected, it will be ascribed to its true cause, the eagerness of my feelings as an injured
& accused man & not to any intentional omission of that high consideration & regard which I entertain for those I have addressed-
I shall Sir take occasion to forward by the next weeks mail the statement of the Judge (Buoy) before alluded to,-Be pleased Sir to lay the enclosed papers with this statement before the President of the United States so soon as may comport with your convenience and with a perfect satisfaction in believing that the venerated President and his Cabinet will see justice hold her sway in this cause, nor readily permit to be sacrificed a servant of the publick wantonly, or without ample reason—

Report on the Actions of Judge Brackenridge
[September Term, 1823]
For the Floridian. *
Law Report.
In the matter of the presentments of the Grand Inquest of the U. S. District and Sup. Court of W. Florida at September special term 1823.
This was a motion made by the Attorney of the United States for W. Florida (W. F. Steele) to place upon the record of the court certain publick presentments make by the Grand Inquest, which were returned by that body publickly into court, with a request that they might be published in the gazette of West Florida entitled “the Floridian,” but which presentments the Judge of the said court
(H. M. Brackenridge) had received in person and placed in his pocket, without permitting them to be seen or read—affirming his right so to do, and asserting them to be private papers and therefore entirely under the control of the court.
The Attorney of the United States, after having received repeated intimations from the Court of its resolve not to permit even an inspection of the presentments; and the Court then being about to adjourn, made the following motion in discharge of his duty, as he alleged. “The Attorney of the U. States for the District of West Florida, moves this Honorable Court, that any presentment, return, official paper or communication, made by the Grand Inquest for the said District, and brought and returned into Court by the Foreman of the said Grand Inquest and which may relate and is understood to relate to the state of the publick prisons in this District, or to any other matters of publick interest; and of which the said Grand Inquest have solicited of this Court the publication, be ordered by the Court to be now inscribed, as usual, upon the records of the Court.”
The Court (H. M. Brackenridge Judge) refused to allow this motion to be entered, or to hear the authorities which the district Attorney offered to adduce; (4 Black. Com.—Hawk.—Hale. 1 Chitty's Crim, Law 110. 121. 162. 216. 220. 320.—6–Am. Dig. Tit. Indictments, Jury. 2. Wils. Works 365. 6. 439. 440.) or to hear any argument in support of the motion; refused again to record the presentments or permit their inspection; affirming again the right to the sole possession and control of the presentments, & going even so far as to menace the Attorney with imprisonment or removal from his office in case he persisted in his application.
The grounds taken the district Attorney were—that the presentments of a Grand Inquest upon publick matters, publicly returned
<pb#898 />
into court, were publick documents, and when requested to be published by that Inquest were to be of course (when placed as usual upon the record) published by the court in compliance with their wish; but that at all events no person or power could legally withdraw them from the archives of the court to which they pertained as fully as the pleadings of a suit on file. The positions of the Judge were—that the presentments from having been addressed in an envelope “to H. M. Brackenridge, Judge &c.” instead of “to the U. S. District Court &c.” or being as usual without endorsement or direction, were by means of such direction, bona fide his private papers, altho' acknowledged to contain presentments on publick affairs and required by the jury to be published; that the motion for recording them should therefore, not be heard, and that argument was inadmissible.
The motion of the Attorney being thus petemptorily overruled, the court adjourned with the presentments still in the keeping of the Judge.

Answer by William F. Steele to Motion for Discharge
[No. 4] [No date, 1824]
The United States vs. George Riley Motion for discharge from Recog”
The attorney of the United States for West Florida, at the Suggestion of the Court (that it's opinion yesterday delivered in this case will be withdrawn upon a Satisfactory explanation from the Attorney)
cheerfully proceeds to state to the Court what he trusts will induce the proposed measures. He wishes this step as well in justice to the Court itself as to the Attorney inasmuch as the misapprehensions of the intentions of the Attorney have induced the Court to do him extreme injustice in that opinion. The Attorney of the United States proceeds to State that in regard to the argument of M. Williams the defendant's Counsel on the 19* when his Motion for discharge was first made to the Court “that the defendant was not taken before a Magistrate for examination and no recognizance was taken &c”—he could not but feel surprized when it actually appeared by the papers that the
<pb#901 />
defendant was taken before a Magistrate J. L. Williams Esq. the person now his Counsel in Court, and whose duty it was to have taken the examination if necessary and whose duty it was to have taken a proper recognizance—and who now stated to the Court that he had drawn it up himself and taken it in form as it appeared believing the case would come up before the Court in the shape which it now assumed. With regard to the papers the Attorney states that he received them from the Clerk of this Court with whom they had been of file from the day of the arrest—tho’ the Clerk had omitted to make upon them the usual endorsement, which omission was unperceived by the Attorney when he received them from that Officer of the Court and deposited them in his Desk, as being a species of Court papers to the possession of which he believed himself entitled as Attorney of the U. States pending the Term of Court.—
The Court seems to have greatly misapprehended the Attorney of the United States in Supposing that any detention of the Defendant was asked or wished for in the first instance other than a Recognizance in the usual form to appear and answer at the ensuing term of the Court.—The Attorney of the United States desired only this in the first place—and believed that the warrant, Oath, & Recognizance were according to law sufficient to authorize the arrest &c. and to justify the recognizance of the defendant to the next Term.—That no examination of Prisoner being expressly required by American Stat. Law, either of the U. States or the Territory but only incidentally alluded to the Territorial Law, and which had it even been express could not here control a proceeding under the U States laws—and by the English Stat. 1 & 2. P & M. and 2 & 3. P. & M. which regulate the English practice in the matter of examinations—it being only required by those Statutes in cases of Manslaughter & felony that it was consequently thought to be here unessential: The Attorney beleiving also that according to L." Hale—1* & 2" Vol. & 1. Chitty Criminal laws that the Warrant of this Court might be regularly returnable before a Justice of the Peace either for Prisoner to be examined—or bound over to appear at the Court—that the charge must appear to the Court clearly to be groundless before the Party would be wholly discharged as the Officer before whom he is brought does not try him but only judges of the propriety of compelling him to stand his trial—The Attorney of the United States believed that the warrant was founded on an oath sufficient according to the Common law—the 4th amendment to the Constitution U.S. and also in conformity with the decision in 3" Cranch, 448. “that it must be for good cause, with Sufficient certainty and supported by oath”—and that the obligation entered into by the party & upon which he was attending at the Court was in conformity with the law which requires a Recognizance—defining it
<pb#902 />
to be an “Obligation of record entered into before a Magistrate duly authorized for that purpose with condition to appear at the Court &
abide its decision &c. and that admitting the Court did entertain the opinion suggested by Defendants Counsel, that the obligation taken was not a sufficient recognizance in this case, still that the Court would have a right to examine defendant on his appearance in Court–Considering it sufficient as the first appearance legally under the Warrant, that Defendant would confess the facts as he had before done out of Court and that the Court would have felt authorized to receive evidence of the absence of most of the material Witnesses at S" Marks a distance of 300 Miles & thus perceived the impossibility of a Bill being sent at this Term before the Grand Jury and also of the propriety of recognizing the party to the ensuing Term. The Attorney of the United States with these beliefs and impressions moved a continuance of the motion before the Court until the morning with the assurance that law should be produced to shew the propriety of Defendant's detention meaning thereby only the detention until the perfection of a recognizance to the next Term (in form and for the reasons the Attorney had requested of the Court) and the Attorney intended only to insist upon these grounds for a continuance which in such a case he had deemed grantable of course—and the intimation to the Court then made with respect to an information in the case was wholly incidental and not in the mind or wish of the Attorney the ground in any way for the continuance asked—The Attorney of the United States says that on appearing on the morning of the 20th in Court for the U.S. in opposition to the motion for discharge of the Defendant without recognizance he had intended to argue the case fully on the part of the U. States and to have produced the law as before-mentioned had not the Court overruled him, and that he then believed the Court would deem it proper to examine the defendant, (then being in Court upon his recognizance or obligation & not in custody &c.) according to the Motion made by the Attorney.—The Attorney of the U. States, then, after the order of discharge moved the Court for the first time that the Defendant Should be detained in Custody until the Attorney submitted to the Court his views on the subject of informations and the propriety of granting or refusing one in the case before the Court.
And here the Attorney of the United States would state that the Court appears to have greatly misapprehended the Scope of his views, as the Attorney never intended to express himself or to be understood by the Court to maintain his right to file an ex Officio information in any case beyond that one then before the Court “that is to Say” where a party had been legally arrested, by proper process below, and recognized to appear in this Court and to answer for a misdemeanor—that he never for a moment intended to be understood to contend for the full power, of the King's Attorney General in England on the subject
<pb#903 />
of informations—that he intended expressly not to be understood (at that time) to contend for any right to take and keep the Defendant in Custody-but only to charge him as above when appearing upon his recognizance—that he was not then or is now aware of any English law which required the permission of Court to file such information or made recognizance to prosecute necessary—that he did intend to say that this proceeding as aforesaid could be taken by him without leave of the Court, except so far as regarded proceedings to the arraignment of the Defendant in which last point he may be incorrect tho' not knowingly. The Attorney of the United States further States, that the view which he took of this Subject—and the belief of his right to take this proceeding were derived from a particular examination of the Constitution & Laws of the United States and American decisions thereupon which were cited in Court by the Attorney. He believed that was not foreign to the genius & Spirit of our Constitution
& laws under the views which he took as aforesaid and that as this proceeding was only to be taken by an Officer under the Solemnity of his Oath and who was appointed & removeable at the will of the President of the United States it was not an improper or impolitick process.
The Attorney of the United States cited to the Court and relied upon in support of his opinion that an information might be filed—the following authorities.—
First.—Constitution of the United States, Amendments Article 5.
& Art. 6th Second—the 20" 21" & 32” Sections of the Act of Congress passed
30" April 1790, entitled “An Act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States.” *—The 3* Section of the Act passed 26*
March 1804 in addition to the aforesaid Act,” and other acts of Congress also the 4" section of the “Act prohibiting the Slave Trade passed 3" March 1819 *-passed in conformity to the Constitution.
Third, The decision in the case of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts vs. the Inhabitants of Waterborough 5. Mass. T. R. 257 in which it was held that “it is a general rule all Publick misdemeanors which may be prosecuted by Indictments may be prosecuted by information in behalf of the Commonwealth unless the prosecution be restrained by the Statute to Indictment”—and 2 Mass. R. and 4. Dallas.
The Attorney of the U. States thus well supported as he supposed &
believing the authority which he cited to deserve more than a
“moment's attention” argued conscientiously according to his belief of the Law and his duty, and in justice to himself states that he would never have been found supporting a position in Court which he could conceive involved principles either odious or repugnant to our
<pb#904 />
Constitution and laws or revolting to correct principle for which he trusts he has all the veneration which a Freeman and an American Lawyer should possess, & as genuine an attachment as even the Hon"
Court itself can entertain, and he is wholly at a loss to what it was either in his argument or manner which could have drawn down upon him the decided disapprobation of this Court. The opinion thus maintained may have been taken up from improper views of the true construction of the law on this subject and may be incorrect but has been honestly held and argued upon in such manner as the Attorney conceived he was entitled to do before the Court in order to submit the question fully & receive its submission. In regard to the Grand Jury the attorney states to the Court that he recollects no word, phrase or expression in his argument which had relation to the Grand Jury—and consequently had no intention to reflect upon that Body or cast any imputations upon them—tho’ he would now observe that the Court would be assured that there was some impatience on the part of the Grand Inquest, if all the correspondence between it and the Attorney were known to the Court yet as a Body he wishes not to be understood to take occasion to censure them—the motion made by the Attorney of the United States to discharge their Foreman during this Term having been made as the Attorney beleived and still must believe in conformity with his duty on account of the conduct of that Officer—The Attorney of the United States takes this opportunity to disclaim any the Slightest intention of disrespect to the Court in the argument of this matter and he did not nor does feel conscious of any phrase or conduct which should have induced the Court to entertain the opinion that the Attorney is capable of acting with disrespect or indecorum to the Court—and is happy in having his own recollections of his deportment and language on the occasion confirmed by the impression produced upon the audiance by several of whom among the most respectable of the Citizens, he has been assured that they were thus fully impressed. The Attorney assures the Court that he understands too well the respect due to the Court and himself ever to act with deliberate disrespect to its authority.—

Gerrish who being duly sworn saith that on the day of the 9th ins" he observed Lepine Coulon & Raoul Coulon and Henry Grandpre passing his Store several times one of them apparently armed & menacing in their deportment that soon after he walked along the Street near the house of Sebastian Barrios in Palafax Street where at a distance he observed Grandpre & Lepine Coulon—that after a brief period he asked a Bystander to enquire of Lepine Coulon why he had struck him (Gerrish) at the Ball a few days before—he declined to enquire Gerrish then asked Grandpres to ask the question, the reply of Coulon was that he had struck him once, and should strike him again
—Coulon then immediately prepared to draw his Sword and upon his getting it some way out this deponent seized him to prevent it, a scuffle ensued in which several attempts were mady by Coulon to stab this Deponent, and during the struggle they fell, while down the attempts to stab him were repeated by Coulon and Grandpre

SIR In answer to your note of this date requesting me to state my impression respecting the filling the Blanks in an Indictment found against the Coulons by the Grand Jury at the late term of the county Court, I have to state for myself then acting as Foreman, I was fully satisfyed that by the name of Coulon the persons were sufficiently identified without the addition of De Williers, as they had never been known to myself by any other name than Coulon untill this prossecution and had always been known by and answered to that name, which I am well satisfied was known to all the Grand Jury or at least all those belonging to this City, and I considered the filling up the Blanks against the name of D* Williers by the U.S. Attorney of no importance nor did I believe him actuated by any incorect motives in doing it.—
In answer to your inquiry whether it was not my impression that the prosecution of yourself before Justice Williams for Forgery, in filling the blanks before the name De Williers before alluded to, was not wholly malicious. I can onely say that being present as a witness, I
was surprised to see the first witness I think that was examined and whose testimony was by no means decisive recognized to apear at the next term of the Court before the examination of other witnesses, and I could not help observing to that person, that it apeared the Justice had mad up his mind before he had examined the witnesses-And finally I considered the prosecution wholly unwarranted by the circumstances of the case Respectfully Your Obt Sert TIMOTHY TWITCHELL

the greater part of them were personally acquainted with the two Coulons and the circumstances—also knew them by that name and no other. Therefore the Jury proceeded to find a true Bill with an understanding to alter the name if necessary—I do further give it as my opinion, that Said Bill was handed again to the Jury by the Attorney with the insertion of part of the name through Some mistake of the Jury the Bill was again returned into Court as before a true Bill without the Jury considering the insertion.—
Understanding that there has been a criminal prosecution commenced against Major Steele for altering the Indictment I can say for myself and what before was the general opinion, that it is one of the most malicious things that could be thought of and that the thing has been premeditated on, and urged Solely to aid in the removal of Maj. Steele from Office. I can Say I have always seen Maj. Steele act uniformly with uprightness as an Officer with correctness &

SIR In reply to your Note of last evening I have to regret that during the term to which your Note alludes my business on the civil side of the Court was so pressing as to leave me no time to attend to the criminal business except where I was myself of counsel The Views of my predecessor, Judge Bowie, of the subject on which you request my opinion would doubtless be more satisfactory I believe I was present when the altercation took place between yourself as District Attorney and the counsel for the Defendants in the Indictment vs the Coulons. My not having attended to the particulars of that altercation sufficiently to be enabled now to state them is the only evidence I have of the light in which I viewed the whole transaction at the time.
If the slightest imputation against the moral correctness of your conduct had been made or even if occasion had been given for such imputation I am certain I should have observed and recollected it.

<docbody>To the Honble The Congress of the United States The petition of the Trustees of The Kentucky institution for the Tuition of the Deaf and Dumb respectfully states that they were incorporated by act of the Legislature of Kentucky passed at their October Session 1822.” That a grant was made of $3000 to enable them to put the Institution into operation, which was effected in April following—Soon after the commencement of our School applications have been made from various parts of the western Country to admit Pupils, this school being the only one west of the mountains It is expected that the number of pupils at the end of 2 months will nearly reach forty and from the difficulty of establishing schools and
<pb#923 />
obtaining qualified Teachers it is not expected that another institution of the kind will be put in operation West of the mountains for a considerable time to come It is therefore confidently expected that this Institution, located, as it is, in the centre of the Western States will be looked to for the instruction of mutes by those States Accordingly the Legislature by an amended clause in our Charter made at the last Session has made provision for the admission of pupils from other States The Legislature of Kentucky actuated by those benevolent feelings which adorn the human heart have granted us such donations as the state of her Treasury Warranted, but it is nevertheless insufficient to enable us to conduct it in the best manner and upon such a scale as to supply the demand for instruction—The expenses of such Institutions are much greater, than ordinary Literary Institutions, in proporportion to the number of pupils. It is also a lamentable fact that much the largest number of deaf and dumb persons are found in the poor and indigent classes of Society and without the charitable aid of the Government, to the exertions of individuals, great numbers of those children of misfortune must forever be debarred of the means of restoration from mental darkness, to their proper rank in the scale of being—
Your Petitioners cannot entertain a doubt, that our national Legislature will be actuated by those feelings which have characterised the acts of every other, before whom the claim has been brought of those, whom, God in the mysterious dispensations of his Providence, has deprived of the faculty of hearing and of speech, of whom, an eloquent divine has said “silence like theirs is eloquence,” Your Petitioners were gratified to find that a former Congress gave with a liberal hand aid to the Hartford Institution, located in a convenient place to supply the North Eastern Section of the Union, and we hope that the national bounty will be extended to our Institution similarly located in the west. Your Petitioners refer for particular information of the state of our Institution to the documents herewith transmitted—We therefore pray that Congress will grant such a donation as in their wisdom may seem proper and your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray By order Superintending Committee D G.

SIR. In a letter received from Fontaine Maury Esquire dated 6th January we find the following “At the same time that I give you this information, I am directed to remark to you, that this appointment was by no means considered a permanent one, and that both the President, and Secretary of State, have been disappointed at not having long since been advised of the complete accomplishment of the duties appertaining to it. It is earnestly hoped and expected of you and your associate that you will bring this business to as spedy a close, as the circumstances of the case may admit of, and that you will give satisfactory explanations for its having been thus long kept open.”.” In compliance with the above instructions we reply that we never did consider the appointment a permanent one, that from the terms of our Commission which directs us “to select from them for preservation among the archives of the Territory, “All archives and Documents which relate directly to the property and sovereignty of the Provinces of East and West Florida, to take an Inventory of the same, and also of all other Documents and papers found among them.” we concluded that the Government was not satisfied with the manner in which the Documents had been previously examined by order of Mr. Worthington, and knowing that in that examination many Bundles of papers were not even untied, but retained or returned as was judg" expedient by the mere reading of the label, and that this mode was by no means satisfactory to the people, as enquiries were daily making for papers said to have existed in the Office under the Spanish Government but were not to be found among those retained by the former Commissioners; under those circumstances we considered it our duty to examine and read every Document seperately in order to enable us to make that selection which the Government required and which the inhabitants expected of us. This duty we have performed in a faithful and attentive manner and have selected from 64.299—Documents 423. many of which have already proven to be important to the Board of Land Commissioners and many others are equally so to private individuals.
We now enclose a Copy of the Inventory in English which will serve further to show the manner in which we have executed the Commission,” as also our separate acts for the ballance of pay due us, * Not found. See ante, p. 820.
<pb#926 />
and the account of the expences incurred in the course of the examination; we have in our present account deducted the number of days which we thought would have been deducted from the first quarters salary, as in our letter to the Department dated August 1823. we stated that the examination had been suspended from the 24" May to 7* July in consequence of Mr. Reynolds being engaged as a Member of the Legislative Council—
We trust this explanation will prove as satisfactory to the Government as the manner of executing our Commission has to people of this part of the Territory.
We are with much respect Sir your very Humble and Obedient Servants—

would recommend that Neamathala and, a few of the head chiefs, should be allowed to visit Washington, Neamathala is a man of uncommon abilities and has great influence, with his Nation, He is one of the most eloquent men I have ever heard If this chief could be attached warmly to our Government, it would cirtainly be good policy, to acquire his confidence & friendship "

<place-time>S*AUGUSTINE 20 March 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR By Lieu" Alberti” I informed you of my return to this place;
I have now the honor to report more in detail as to my operations under the commission to survey the Indian boundary line—The limits allotted the Indians were to commence at a point 5 miles North of Okehumke; but if on examination of the Country it should be found that there was not a sufficient quantity of land adequate to the support of the Indians to be received within the boundaries designated; then the north line was to be extended so as to ensure that object—On examination I found the country fully equal to the support of the Indian population, as reported, combining agriculture, stock, and hunting, provided the Settlements at Okehumke and at Setarkys could be preserved *—Indeed the commencement of the reservation 5
miles north of Okehumke was with a view to that object, and the stipulation of a removal in certain events, was conceded in order to reconcile as far as practicable the Indians of those settlements to the general terms of the Treaty—It was found on examination however that the line, first called for, encroached upon the settlement of Setarky approaching within sight of his improvements, and running through the centre of his grazing grounds—Independent of the vicinity of the same line to the establishment at Okehumke, the closing line to its commencement would likewise have passed through the grazing grounds of that settlement; which would have proven vexatious to the Indian as run appearantly with no object, securing to a white population no additional advantages as to security, soil fit for cultivation, or grounds connected with agricultural establishments which might be made—It was deemed therefore advisable to extend the north line, and it has been done to 10 miles north of Okehumke, running East &
West to the waters of the Ocklewaha, and the swamps of the Amaxura or Withlachuche river—from thence the boundary has been surveyed as called for in the Treaty to the south end of the Big Hammock—
The article required such a direction however to this line as to include Checuchate—A line to the South end of the Big Hammock would, if continued in the same direction, have passed thro: and interferred with the Hammock & Savannah of Checuchatte, so as to have seriously
<pb#928 />
affected the settlement in that quarter—The continuation of the line for 4 miles therefore, and within the spirit of terms, “to include Checuchatte” has been made to deviate a little to the west from the original direction—From thence it is run and marked (with the exception of some interposing & impenetrable swamps as defined in the Treaty untill the same terminates in a great savannah the commencement of the extensive south western hunting grounds—These savannahs are said to extend south & east to within a few miles of the Atlantic & independent of the impracticability of passing over them, from their peculiar character; the want of wood water &c it would have been impossible otherwise to have defined the line for the want of objects to mark—The South line running East & West—
and the East line “North fifteen west for 50 miles”—as called for in the 2" article of the Treaty will pass over these extensive grassy planes and cannot be defined; the closing line to the beginning may I presume to a certain extent be surveyed & marked; but the advancing of the northern line necessarily produced a change in this & its direction could not be ascertained untill the probable length of the Southern line was determined by known points and distances on the Atlantic—
I should have proceeded on the operation but the uncertainty of being able to penetrate by the Atlantic shore to the south; the time necessary to the accomplishment of the object; the exhausted state of my provisions, reduced condition of men & horses, the lateness of the season & importance of marking the reservations on the Appalachicola immediately all concurred to predth induce a postponement of what may be performed at any other time without detrement to the public service—This line will doubtless terminate or unite with the eastern line on the same extensive district of savannahs & Ponds noted, and beyond which no designation of the Indian boundary can be made—If it could it would in my opinion, considering the general character of the territory South be unimportant, and unquestionably vexatious to the Indian population as seeming to deprive their Hunters of the use of a district of country which can never be converted to any use by white population—It is valued by the Indians only for the game which it affords. They do not & cannot reside on or near that district of savannahs & it is only visited by them during the dry and winter or hunting seasons—The Indians must necessarily form their settlements near the Northern & Western limits and sourses of Talachopco Creek—Their permanent improvements therefore will be concentrated to a certain extent, while during the hunting season alone they will roam over the extensive savannahs South in quest of game—To have marks therefore on this district to restrict them in their hunts would appear vexatious without any object—It may be advisable however to let the Indians distinctly understand the extent of their reservations as well as it can be explained; but that the Presi-
<pb#929 />
dent of the U.S. permits them to make use of those grounds during the hunting season, prohibiting however any extension of their settlements in that quarter or near the sea coast south—The line from the Eastern extremity of the northern limit as extended it would be important to have deferred as far as practicable; it would exhibit their bounds in that quarter & in conjunction with the western line explain the probable termination South—The marking of this line might be easily connected, and at but inconsiderable additional expence, with the survey of the contemplated road to Cape Florida—by which reconnoisance in conjunction with the one directed to Cape Sable a mass of information may be collected shedding much additional light on the geography of Florida—I accompany this with a hasty sketch which will assist in explaining for a time the direction & relative position of points lines &c untill a more perfect map of the country can be prepared from the notes & surveys made I have this day drawn upon you in fav of M T C Gibbs for three hundred & nine dollars on account of expenditures to running Indian boundary * &

The emigration to this Territory is considerable and from information little doubt is entertained that the whole country between the Apalachicola and Suwannee rivers will soon be settled with a dense population—The appointment of a surveyor general for this Territory who should commence his labors immediately would serve to increase the emigration to Florida. I believe that in five years if the land is brought into market that I have seen and know to be rich and valuable a great part of the Florida debt will be reimbursed.”

<docbody>SIR I learn that charges have been prefered against William F.
Steele Esq District Attorney for West Florida. What those charges are, I do not know, but I do know that he has been guilty of much improper conduct, and when I see men supporting him against their own convictions of his incapacity, I have thought that my duty to society & to the Government required me to make to you Excellency
<pb#933 />
a statement of facts. I therefore beg you Excellency to excuse this intrusion on your valuable time.
The dockets of our Courts herewith presented will shew in what manner our Criminal proceedings have been conducted. Should he endeavour to cast the blame of this wretched management, on the Judge of the District Court, the pure character of that Man will shield him from the aspersion, and it will be seen, that in the Circuit &
County Courts, the mismanagement has been equally apparent.
The whole course of Mr Steele's conduct here, has tended to shield the Guilty and to harrass the Innocent. Col. Barnet is said to be among his supporters" yet Col Barnet in my presence declared that having employed Mr Steele to prosecute a Suit of his in Court, he found him so incompetent, that he would rather pay him to drop it, than to continue. Many other persons besides myself heard this opinion given without any reserve. But it has been since discovered that altho he is not competent to conduct legal proceedings he has been able to scribble libels in a profligate News Paper against the Col's pollitical opponents.
Mr Davidson another of Mr Steeles zealous defenders during the last Summer shipped some Negroes to this place from New Orleans contrary to the Act of Congress but Mr Steele refused to prosecute him.” On this circumstance is founded the complaint of the Collector some time since forwarded to your Department. Yet Mr Steele lately Libelled the Florida Schooner in ten thousand dollars for bringing a Gentleman Servant with his Master from New Orleans. But Mr Davidson was and the other Gentleman was not a friend of Mr Steele.
Prosecutions are constantly multiplying against this Man for Tailors Bills, for monies collected for his Clients and pocketed by him, his Library consisting of Chitty & Blackstone have been seized by the police officer to pay fines for riotous conduct in our streets and these books had not, nor have not yet been paid for. When any person has had the temerity to oppose him the least punishment they have had to expect was an Indictment for some high crime supported before the Grand Jury with his oath and pleadings. Certainly it is not for the honor of our Goverment to support the most intemperate and immoral man in Community as a pattern for offenders to copy, even should such a man be defended by a few persons for private pollitical ends.
I therefore most respectfully pray your Excellency to lay before the President the evidences” accompanying this Letter and please

SIR Understanding that certain charges had been preferred against W. F. Steele Esq." U.S. Attorney for this District, among which one is founded upon a letter addressed by me to the Hon” H. M. Breckenridge," I take the Liberty of stating, that this was not intended for the purpose of invading the private or moral character of M" Steele, as I would be amongst the first in affording a testimonial of the honorable and correct deportment of this Gentleman since his residence at this place Although I considered at the time and still maintain it to have been the duty of M Steele to have proceeded Officially in the suit alluded to, and in requesting him to do so was actuated by the purest motives of my official duty, yet conceiving it incumbent upon every honest citizen to lend his aid however feeble in protecting an oppressed individual I beg leave to submit to you my testimony of the uniformly zealous and independent manner in which he has discharged his Official duties in all cases wherein he has deemed it his duty to appear.
I much regret that a letter of mine should be used in a clandestine and insidious attempt to effect the destruction of any individual.

<docbody>GENERAL, I had the honor to receive by yesterday's mail your letter of the 16* February last"; this letter, if the mails were regular, ought to have been received on the 9" Ulto., and I regret its previous failure, for if it had come to hand earlier it would have saved to the Quartermaster's department $.600 in the charter of a vessel on the
27" Ulto. I had postponed making the charter until the last moment, hoping to receive your answer to my letter of 22" January * in time to supercede its necessity, but there was provisions for the Troops at Tampa only up to the 15" Inst. admitting that no Rations had been issued to Indians visiting the Post, which doubtless has been done;
hence I did not think it prudent to delay chartering a vessel any longer, after the arrival of the mail before this last. I have engaged the Schooner Florida for the voyage at $800, and made it one of the conditions, as it did not materially affect the price of the charter, that she should touch at St. Marks on her return & bring from thence a Cargo of Military Stores. She has on board for Tampa, about 500
Barrels of Quartermaster's & Subsistence Stores, & I have also shipped on her, the four oxen hitherto kept in service at Cantonment Clinch, Colonel Brooke having stated to me in a letter recently received, that more Teams & one Waggon were indispensably necessary to enable him to put his men in Quarters before the hot Season commences.—
It is with extreme diffidence that I shall incur so much expense to the department in exercising the discretionary power, with which you have honored me, in regard to purchasing the Schooner Florida; and think it necessary to apprise you of the reasons which determine me to do so.” The enclosed statement exhibits the Several amounts already paid or contracted for in this office for vessel transportation in a given period; and also the cost of sailing a suitable public transport during the same time, & which could have performed the same service with ease. It is to be observed that this Statement does not embrace the expense incurred for transportation of Officer's baggage from this place to Tampa within that period & which has amounted to, say, $.300 more. The vessel alluded to was brought out new last november, she is built of the best materials, is copper-fastened throughout, completely finished & wellfound in Sails, rigging, cabin furniture
&c. She is what is termed a centre-board vessel, is of easy draught of water, & carries a large cargo in proportion to her tonnage. Last November, her owner, would have probably sold her for about $.4800;
<pb#937 />
at present he has offered her to me for $.4000.—If the Ameliawasa suitable vessel for the public service at all, which she is not on account of her size, She is now nearly worn out & her Captain represents to me that she must immediately have a new suit of Sails & be partially rebuilt if retained in service. Her cargo is about 175 Barrels, and it requires but one man more, at $.20 per month, to navigate the Florida carrying 500 Barrels, than is necessary for the Amelia. She has been turned over to me by Captain Hunt agreably to your order & I am about to dispatch her to St. Marks for a cargo of the public property there; & on her return if the Florida is purchased, she will be of no further service in the department, & I shall sell her without putting any repairs on her, as it would probably cost as much, if not more, to repair her, than she would then sell for.—
I do not mean to be understood that a public vessel will continue always to save as much as is shewn by the enclosed statement, because that must depend solely upon the activity of her employment; but it is more than probable that She will be actively employed, for independent of the necessary transportation of provisions &c. to Tampa, the entire failure of the Contractor to deliver provisions at this Post renders it necessary to procure them from New Orleans.—
I have the honor to be Sir, with perfect respect Y Mo. Ob. Serv"

<place-time>CAMP ON HILLSBOROUGH BAY 6" April 1824</place-time>
<docbody>GEN' Since my Communication of Feb’ 3”" this, is the only oppertunity which has been offered me of addressing you (the arrival of Major Wright" by Water) The Troops Continue in good health, are well supplied with provisions, and are industriously engaged in the erection of quarters. Cap" D. E. Burch of the Quarter Masters Dep" at Pensacola, has facilitated by every means in his power, the Completion of our barracks, by Complying most promptly with all the necessary requisitions.—By the middle of this month, the men will be in their quarters, which are the best log buildings I have ever seen, both for health & duration the rooms being large, high, airy, and as well put together as possible, the whole 260 feet in length and 12 feet from floors to the loft. We have Completed the quarter Masters &
Commissary's Store houses, bake house, The Hospital will be finished
(viz two blocks of it) in ten days. The officers quarters have also been Commenced, Considering, that the first tree was felled on the
20" Feb. I have every reason to be pleased with the great industry of the officers and Men, besides this each Company has a large garden, now in fine Cultivation.—I must beg leave to renew my application for two Ass" Surgeons for should any epidemic disease take place here, we should be in a most deplorable situation. I wrote to the Surgeon Gen' on this subject early in Jan * but, he has not done me the honor of ever answering my letter, Should we be unfortunate enough to have the Yellow fever, I shall feel myself relieved from all responsibility in as much, as I have written repeatedly to the Surgeon Gen.'
on this subject.
The Indians appear to me, to be more & more displeased at the Treaty, and still more so, at the running of the line, and I am not unapprehensive of some difficulty. They have an idea, that the
<pb#941 />
nation, is about to go to war with Great Britain, and was it to be the the case, they would most certainly join our enemy. In Consequence of its having been reported to me that a large number of Indians, were seen near the Camp, after tattoo, who appeared to have an intention of taking us by surprise, the Troops, were put under arms, and Continued so during the night large paroles were also sent out some distance, but no Indian was discovered. As the Man who reported it to me, come running in, and stated that he had seen them not more than 15 Minutes before, an attack was calculated on most Certainly. The officers and Men turned out with an alacrity and spirit, which did them great credit, and I feel a Confidence, that no Indian force in this Country could meet us, with the least prospect of success, although they can bring at least 700 warriors into the field.
There is an absolute necessity of some field pieces here, and I beg, that the Commdg officer at Pensacola may be directed to have transported to this place, two six pounders, with a proper supply of Ammunition and implements—We have discovered that this place, has been a depot for pirates, finding the other day, the remains of three unfortunate persons who from the shot holes, in their hats, and from stakes set in the ground, with ropes attached to them & the appearance of fire, that some of them had been shot and others burnt to death. There were near them two six pound shot, and an old looking glass. From the ropes and the burnt wood, it appears it must have been done about four or five Months since.

In pursuing the course I have done, I did So under the thorough conviction that it would meet the approbation of the Department; And I shall continue to act until a Coll' shall arrive or until I receive instructions to the contrary—
In regard to the exactions Tonnage Duty and Light Money from Wessels arriving from the Isle of Cuba & the Bahamas, I have been at Some loss how to act; particularly with respect to the latter, And you will perceive that in two instances, Light Money has not been

charged—I have rented a building for a Custom House, for one quarter from the 1st. March, not being able to rent for a shorter period & even that with considerable difficulty—I have likewise purchased a Boat for the Revenue Service & employed as many Seamen as is at this time necessary—You will perceive by the Statement herewith rendered, that I have retained the fees & commission accruing to the Collector; thinking that they will of course be allowed me. The Salary I have made no mention of; leaving that entirely to your decision.
I would request of you, if I can be permited to return home in the last of June or the first of July, as it my purpose to be at home during the Sickly Season at this place; Say, the months of July, August

You will be pleased to any communications for me to the care of Mr. Edwin Lee of Norfolk, or if they could be Sent via Baltimore to the care of Mess" Martin, Knight & Co. of Havana, the chance of receiving them would be much better, as an opportunity Seldom offers from Norfolk.

PENSACOLA, April. 11" 1824
Hon” JOHN. C. CALHOUN Secretary of War SIR Col" Humphryes the Indian Agent arrived here a few days since accompanied by Neamathala and four of his chiefs—who came on a visit to me for the purpose of assertaining whither they would be permitted to visit Washington. I informed them that you had been written to on this subject and they must patienly wait for your answer I recommend earnestly that Neamathala and some of his principal chiefs, should be allowed to visit the city, [Your letter of the 24" of last December "relating to the removal of the Indians, and also a copy of your letter of the same date on the same subject to Col" Humphreys * did not come to hand untill three days since It is now too late to remove the Indians untill September, Time will be important if any regard is to be paid to economy," -
Contracts must be made for the supply of the indians, and some time must elapse before they can be executed beside their are other arrangements, for tools stock &c. required by the treaty—which the indians expect will be faithfully and punctually provided—To attempt a hasty removeal of these people, before we are ready on the part of the Goverment to execute what we are bound by Treaty to perform, would not only increase the dissatisfaction of the Indians, but greatly enhance, the expence. The Indians would also lose their present crops which are now planted; and no possitive disadvantage can result from this delay.
In addition to what is stated, I will add that the boundary of the country intended for their occupation, has not yet been finally settled.
Co" Gadsden wrote to me from Charlotte Harbour, that the lands in the Peninsula are by no means equal to his expectation—
The Northern line of the Indian boundary will I presume be extended according to the Treaty Co" Humphreys meet with Co." Gadsden on his way from St.
Augustin to Pensacola and conversed with him on these subjects I
am happy to say that his opinions are dicidedly with me, in the vieus I have expressed on these subjects—
It will be less expensive to furnish the Indians with Beef, than pork, The Beef can be driven to the several points requirid, for even
<pb#945 />
less than the Pork could be purchased for in New Orleans. Con and Salt or Flour if corn can not be obtained, will be had cheapest in New Orleans, I am satisfied that many of the Indians will leave the Seminoles and settle among the creeks before the next fall, It is my opinion that not more than fifteen hundred, will remove into the boundary—this opinion has been formed on my own observation and intelligence, derived from the Indians while I was with them during last winter—Whatever order you may deem proper to give, either as to the removal or manner of supplying the Indians shall be promptly executed, should you intertain any vieus different from my own. If the arrangements are left to my discression, the most rigid economy consistent with the fair and just execution of the Treaty, will govern me in the expenditure of the funds which may be transmitted for this object—]” The authority to draw on your department for funds—cannot be used to advantage, in Florida for large sums—The circulating medium, of this Territory, is principaly composed of the Bank paper of Alabama Georgia and North Carolina
—which are not current in New Orleans—I would therefore suggest the propriety of making the Bank of New Orleans the Deposit of the funds to be used in Florida, so that from time to time I could check for the money. I should not like to have a large sum in my hands—for I have no place of safety—to secure it, and accident or robbery might render me responsible, I hope by the active, assistance of Co" Humphreys—on whom I can confidently reley—that the Treaty will be carried into effect for much less then was expected, If you have not appointed a sub agent, in the place of Capt. Pelham, I recommend Sargent Ayres belonging to the command at St. Augustin This man attracted my particular attention during the last year and he is cirtainly one of the finest soldiers in our Army, he is sober, active, sensible, and completely a man of business—He has always enjoyed the confidence and esteem of his superior Officers—This mans appointment would render a service to our country—Ayres never applied to me on this subject, and nothing but his uncommon merit could induce me to recommed him to you, It is important, that the person who may be appointed, should receive your order forthwith to report himself either to Co." Humphreys or myself, as may be most convenient, for his services will be more in demand this summer than at any time thereafter"

The Secretary of War, to whom your letter was submitted, approves intirley of your views in relation to the road from Pensacola to Fort Mitchell, and directs that you commence your operations should the season not be so far advanced as to endanger the health of the troops, so soon as your other duties will allow of your absence from Pensacola.
The route by Sherlocks ferry, for the reasons which you have stated, is considered preferable to that by Beelers ferry.
You will make such a road as to admit, with facility, the movement of carraiges, carts, waggons, &" and cause substantial wooden bridges to be erected over all the principal streams on the route—which shall not require ferries. The Commanding Officer at Pensacola will be instructed to furnish a Subalterns Command for this service, which will be under your orders.”

SIR. By an act of Congress approved the 28” of February last,"
the President was authorized to cause a road to be surveyed and marked out from Cape Sable the South Western extremity of Florida, to the point where the road from Pensacola to S*Augustine will cross the Suwanna river. You have been selected for this service, and you
<pb#947 />
will commence your operations so soon as the season shall permit—
You will select the most direct practicable route between the points named, passing by Charlotte Harbour and the post at Tampa Bay.
The route must be marked by cutting, or as it is called in the Western Country blazing, trees at convenient distances, so that the troops ordered to open the road, may trace the route without the aid of a guide.
The Commanding Officer at Tampa Bay, will be instructed by an order from the Adj* Generals office to place under your command a Subaltern Officer, and such number of non Com" Officers and privates as may be necessary. You will employ guides, and provide the number of horses, mules, tools & instruments which the service may require. Having completed the survey, you will make to this Office a detailed report of your proceedings, so soon as you possibly can, taking care to note practicularly the nature of the country, the quality of the land, the number and condition of the Indians in the vicinity of the proposed road—the state of the several streams on the route, whether it be practicable to construct bidges over them, or whether ferries be necessary, and any other circumstances which you may think interesting.
You will also make a detailed estimate of the funds necessary to complete the proposed road, and forward it to this office.”

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR. April 20, 1824</place-time>
<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL Pensacola.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 25* Ultimo,” and the estimate of expenses on account of Indian Affairs within your agency for the two first quarters of the year 1824, amounting to 2,645$, which is admitted—Also your letter of the 26" ultimo,” accompanied by your account for your Superintendency. You have charged, I find, since the appointment of the agent, for three months, at the rate of 1500$
per Annum. This is contrary to the decision of this Department as communicated to you in my letter of the 25* Oct" last.” That
<pb#948 />
decision was, that an allowance at the rate of 1500$ per Annum would be made during the period prior to the appointment of an agent; but
750$ was fixed as the sum to be allowed after his appointment. The circumstance of the absence of the Agent will not justify any advance upon this latter sum.
I have directed the allowance to be made on your account in conformity with this view, and the instructions of my letter of the 25"
Oct" last.
It may be proper to remark that there is no allowance made by law, other than for your Salary as Governor, for the performance of your duty as Superintendent, but it is made as a matter of justice out of the appropriation on account of Indian Affairs—no allowance, of course, can be made by the Department, but to cover the expense which may be incidentally incurred in the performance of such duty.
If you think the allowance to you is not sufficient to cover your expense, the Department has no objection to commute it for such sum as may be actually expended in the performance of your duty, on a statement being made in the usual form accompanied by the proper vouchers.”
I have the honor &c. &c J. C. CALHOUN.

<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Pensacola.
SIR, Reports having reached this Department through the public prints, and very recently thro' an official Channel, stating that private individuals, as well as those who have been licensed to trade with the Indians, carry on a system of trapping and hunting in violation of the regulations established by the intercourse law of 1802”; and the licensed traders in direct violation of the express conditions on which they have been licensed under the act of 6" May 1822,” I have to call your attention particularly to this subject. You will therefore immediately instruct the Indian Agents within your superintendency rigidly to enforce the intercourse law against all violations of its provisions, as well against those who are not, as those who are licensed to trade with the Indians—the latter of whom not only put at defiance the act of Congress but also the express provisions of their bonds, under which they hold their license.”
I have delayed calling your attention to this subject under the impression that Congress would act on it; but believing that the Session
<pb#949 />
is now too far advanced to adopt any provisions in relation to it, and the season of trade being now about to commence, I have thought any further delay unadvisable.”
Copies of this letter have been transmitted to the Commanding Officer within your agency * directing their co-operation in enforcing the regulations of the Government on those subjects.”

I have sent her to New Orleans to be coppered, and on her return," I shall have full employment for her for some months to come; as it is now pretty well ascertained that the Brig Mary, which sailed from here on the 9* March last laden with Building Materials
& other Military Stores; and also having $.200, funds, on board on account of the Quartermaster's department, has been either lost at sea or captured by pirates—most probably the latter as the Florida fell in with a Schooner off Tampa which the Captain took to be a piratical cruiser—as she had not been heard of at Cantonment Brooke so late as the 8” Inst.—The failure of this Brig has occasioned serious delay in building the Barracks at Tampa. I shall wait however only a few days longer, and then, if no tidings of her be received, forward additional Supplies."

& the triplicate Bill of lading, which however only specifies the quantity of packages without regard to Contents. The money was enclosed in a letter to Lieut. Page and not known to the Captain.—I
am unable at the present moment to afford any other proof as to the quantity of each article forwarded & of the money being sent, but my own certificates;—Capt. Crupper * was knowing to the fact but he has left the place. I will endeavor however to procure his testimony, in case it should be hereafter required.—
The Schooner Florida is a Strong, new vessel, built Suitable for the coast; and is moreover a remarkably fast sailer, hence I think such an accident is not likely to occur soon, again.—
All the public property is now removed from Fort St. Marks; but I
understand from the Commanding Officer at Cantonment Clinch, that Governor Duval has this day made a Requisition on him for a company to be stationed there temporarily, that is, until the Indians remove to the limits assigned them, which cannot now be done before the next ensuing fall Season.—
The Transport Schooner amelia being no longer required for the public service in the Quartermaster's department, I sold her on the
20* Inst: for $.650, at private Sale, having previously caused her value to be appraised & certified by competent and disinterested persons. I obtained the highest valuation for her, one of the persons having estimated her to be worth only $.550."—

<docbody>ROB' MICHELL P M Pensacola W F
SIR. That part of my circular, which required the oath of printers to accompany their return of newspapers sent by mail, was stricken out before the circular was forwarded to Postmasters, though retained in the publication of it in the newspapers.
The object of obtaining printers certificates is quite as much to accommodate them, and facilitate the circulation of their papers, as to aid the Dep" in its operations. The law requires them to write in every bundle of papers the number which it contains chargeable with postage; and to do this when they Send to a great number of different Post Offices in many instances proves a Serious inconvenience to them, and when the issuing of their papers is at the last moment before the departure of the mail, this additional labour, and the time necessarily occupied by the Postmaster in taking an account of them, will often delay their papers till the departure of another mail.
To prevent all this delay, if printers will furnish Postmasters with a list of the number of papers Sent to each Office, certifying to the best of their knowledge its correctness they need not mark the number upon each bundle, and the Postmaster need make no delay to take the account but to forward them as they are put in his Office, and forward the printers certificate for the account of newspapers Sent from his Office. If the printer refuses to do this (which I think he will not, after understanding the object) you will Still receive and forward his papers, provided he endorses the number upon every bundle, and you will yourself keep the account of the number to each Office, but enter none of them upon your post-bills.
You will keep your account of newspapers received for delivery at your Office, by charging yourself in advance at the beginning of each quarter for the quarterly amount of all papers regularly coming to your Office; and for such as come occasionally, you will charge yourself at the time of their arrival, at the end of the quarter enter the whole amount in your a/c current."

<place-time>CAMP ON HILLSBOROUGH BAY 25th April 1824</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL. I had the Honor, as well as the satisfaction, to receive your two letters, of the 16"" & 20" January," on the 16th day of this month, by a Brig from Pensacola (loaded with materials for this post,) which had, had, a passage of thirty five days, or they would have been, more promptly acknowledged.
I am also gratified to learn that you had approved of my engaging the transportation to this place, in the absence of Captain Burch, and further, that you had directed him to supply us, with evry thing necessary, to make us comfortable. From the moment of Capt. Bs.
arrival from St Augustine, he has done evry thing which could facilitate the movement, and the promptitude with which, he has since met the necessary requisitions, deserves my warmest acknowledgements. In consequence of the landing the stores, on our first arrival here, and the cutting out, of the thickest under growth, I have ever seen, for the purpose of fixing the scite, we were not enabled to go into the woods til the 20" Feb, on which day, the first tree was felled.
Since that period, we have completed, a very fine comissy & quarter masters store house, an excellent bakehouse four blocks, for the mens barracks, (two rooms each block) 25 feet by 20, 12 feet, from the floors, to the joists, raised, on Blocks 3 feet from the ground, the whole under one roof & shingled between the intervals of each block
(being 20 feet) & with a portico of 12 feet wide, surrounding the building. The men will occupy this building to day. which is now comfortable, but will require, more finishg, which can be done at our liesure. This I think is the best place for quarters in a southern climate, particularly in so low a latitude as this, the rooms, being well aired, and shaded. The officers quarters & hospital built on the same plan, are all up, and will be completed, by the first of June, provided the brick & some more plank which we have required, arrive in time. I have searched in evry direction near us, for clay to make brick, or stone, for the chimneys, which I am unable to find, and indeed the Indians tell me, there is none in the country. This post, in its first establishment, may be more expensive, than the Government probably expect, but when once completed, no other expence can be incurrd than the common contingent expences of all posts.
It is absolutely necessary, that evry precaution should be taken, to prevent disease, but I cannot feel less than very apprehensive of being visited by some epidemic. Should it occur, neither the officers, * NA (WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 6), approving his transportation arrangements and informing him of the appointment of Capt. Isaac Clark as assistant quartermaster at Tampa Bay. " Loc. cit. 
<pb#953 />
or men, the Government, or Nation, can say, but what evey thing such has been done, which could save us from such a fatality & scourge.
I have also taken into consideration, that the reasons, which induced the establishement of this post, must exist for a long period, and that of course it will be permanent. Besides this it will be found vey useful, as a depot, for the troops to be employed in cutting the roads to Florida point, and a point on the atlantic, both for supplies &
their sick.
The water here is not so good, as we can wish, and I shall be compelled to dig [MS. torn] wells, or bring water from a very good spring, about a mile from us (lately found) in bored pine aqueducts.
In digging the wells, I have found the water so near the surface, (but vey bad) that I could not free them by buckets, so, as to dig deeper, I have therefore sent, to Captain Burch for one pump complete, and a pump borer, with which we could make more pumps if we should find the water better, at a greater depth, or by the aqueduct, as might be found best.”

SIR, In reply to your letter of the 20" instant " in relation to the claims of W* King, P. Prieto, John Dominques and F. Morino, for timber cut by the U. States troops off certain tracts of land near cantonment Clinch, belonging to them respectively, I have to observe, that the supports which they should have to render them admissible are–
1. The proper proof of proprietorship
<pb#954 />
2. The evidence of the timber being so cut by the United States'
troops—and
3. That the amount charged is the real damage sustained.
With the claims are now exhibited Certificates of the regular Land Commissioners that the claimants have filed (with the exception of King) their claims to the land—This has no bearing on either point–And also certificates of the Arbitrators chosen by the Quarter Master and the claimants, setting forth the amount of damage, which corresponds with the charges. This is deemed insufficient evidence on the third point, because the grounds of the assessment are not set forth—and for ought that appears in the certificates the damage may have been produced by other causes than those assigned in the claims—and because it does not appear that the assessment was made under oath.
The above requisites are stated in the order of their importance, and therefore, until the first point be settled by the favourable decision of the only legal authority, the Land Commissioners, in addition to satisfactory evidence on the other two, it is obvious the claims cannot be allowed."

<place-time>WAR DEPARTMENT May 3" 1824</place-time>
<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY GOV* DUVAL
SIR I have received your two letters of the 11" ultimo" inclosing a copy of your proposals for supplies to be furnished to the emigrant Indians, also a letter from the agent Col" Humphreys to you.” I
wrote to you on the 8" ultimo " in reply to your letter of the 19*
March last " consenting to the wishes of Several of the Seminole Indians to visit Washington—a copy of that letter I herewith enclose, in the event of a miscarriage of the original. The reasons you assign for delaying the removal of the Indians, are entirely satisfactory. You will determine in your discretion, upon the proper time, in the ensuing autumn, to begin this work of removal, and commence accordingly—
meanwhile the advertizing for the supplies will be delayed. When you do advertize you will give notice at New Orleans, and Charleston, as well as at S*Augustine. As to the kinds of provisions which may be best, their selection is left to your discretion. The season for removal being deferred 'til the ensuing Autumn, I will thank you meanwhile, and as early as you can, to furnish me with an estimate of the cost which is likely to attend upon the emigration, upon the best data you may be able to command. A requisition for the amount will be made on the Treasury in due time for you and the most favourable arrangements made as to the place of deposit that can be commanded.
I am glad to learn that the amount will fall short of the Sum hitherto estimated to carry this Treaty into effect. Your recommendation of a Sub-agent is under consideration and will be acted on in due time. I
am favourably impress'd towards the Chief, Nea-ma-tha-la, and as he will doubtless make one of the four who are authorized to visit Washington, he will have every attention paid to him which your representation of his rank and character entitles him to. I will cheerfully, if it wou’d not be thought to weaken his influence among his people, by the excitement of Jealousy, allot him a small annuity—of the propriety of this from your better acquaintance with the disposition and temper of these Indians you can best judge—or if it wou’d be more agreeable, I
see no objection to a purchase of his reservation, as you suggest, provided it cou’d be done on reasonable terms. I think it very
<pb#962 />
desireable that he shou'd accompany the emigrants—his influence as you remark wou'd doubtless be very Salutary.”
I am very Respectfully &c J. C. CALHOUN

<place-time>S*AUGUSTINE 4th May 1824</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR Your much esteemed favour of the 14" ulto," accomp”
copy of the 4* Sec of a law of Congress authorizing the survey of certain Roads in this territory," is now before me & its contents duly noticed. The late hour at which the mail arrived last evening, &
not being myself possessed of all the information you have been pleased to require of me, will prevent my complyance untill next mail.
I hope it will then be in my power to make you a satisfactory reply.
The roads contemplated to be opend in this Territory must necessarily prove of great advantage to the Nation. I trust you will think as I do, knowing how much it is in your power to promote their early accomplishment.—I notice with much pleasure that part of your Letter in which you speak of your wish to make a settlement in this Country, as I am inclined to believe you could not make choice of any section of the United States which presents greater Agricultural advantages than this. There is a tract of excellent Hammock & Swamp land immediately near the place where the town of New Smyrna was to have been built which is offered for Sale. I will endeavour to
<pb#963 />
ascertain the terms on which it can be purchased & will acquaint you.
I would however prefer to have you settle more in my Neighbourhood, Say at Matanzas about thirty miles South of this City. The lands there are equally good & in my estimation suitable either for the culture of Cotton or Sugar Cane & with the advantage of having an extended Range for Cattle both of good Pine barren & Savannah land. The latter are indeed composed of very rich Soil, folming three distinct stratum, the first is a pliable black Mould, 2" a Soil some what of the consistancy of Clay, & the 3" of very Strong Marl. I ditched thirty acres of it & found it all to be the Same; & I planted 9 acres of it in Corn & three ef in Cotton as an experiment; the former I am satisfied will do well, but, not the latter, as the Marl is Hatteh agreed not favourable to that plant.—From the proximity of these Savannahs to the waters of the head of the river Matanzas I am persuaded they must have been originally Salt water Marshes & the Marl bottoms formed from the decomposition of Oyster Shells.
If our Board of land Commissioners could act with more activity in the adjudication of titles to lands, this Country would soon present a very different aspect from what it now does.—There is always some fatality attending our public concerns here. At present we have but two Commissioners & one of them (Judge Blair, a truly good &
worthy character) is so very ill that he can scarecy attend to the duties of the board, nor is he expected to be much longer for this world! !
his loss would be great to this Country."—The titles to lands here are not so bad as they have been represented, there are some groundless pretentions, such as the claims from British emigrants & others who have forfeited their rights by abandonment & by a noncomplyance of the conditions on which the land was granted to them. This class of claims conflict much with the right of the legitimate owner, but, were it not for the existance of these false claims, which under the Spanish government would never have been brought forward, the Gentlemen of the Bar would must be with little or no employment; &
it is the dread of requiring their service which for some time will deter both sale & purchase, at least untill the commissioners have adjudicated on the claims.
With reference to my next permit me to close this with the assurance of my being Dear Sir with much esteem Your Ob Serv"
JOSEPH M HERNANDEZ
Excuse my English, it is some what unconnected.
N.B. from my present knowledge of the Country South of the river Sn Lucie I fear I fear it will not be practicable to open a road

<docbody>DEAR SIR I send for your perusal the enclosed notes, from which you will perceive, why I am desirous to have the communication made to M Blair of which I took the liberty to speak to you this afternoonthe whole conduct of these gentlemen was one constant tissue of miserable evasion—
<pb#967 />
I have to request that you will return me the enclosed directed to New York—
I have the honor to remain with much respect ALEXANDER HAMILTON
JAMES MONROE Esq—
[Addressed] James Monroe Esq—
[Enclosure]
Report by Alexander Hamilton of Actions as Land Commissioner Alexander Hamilton in justification of his conduct in withdrawing his confidence from his colleagues William W. Blair and Davis Floyd commissioners appointed to ascertain claims & titles to lands in East Florida
1* The repeated refusal of the majority to adopt any arrangement of the business of the Commission and consequent procrastination and embarrassment in the progress of its duties
2" The repeated decisions of incidental, important questions, unaccompanied with the responsibility and certainty of written evidence of what was determined, paralyzing and embarassing to the influence of the minority.
3" The repeated refusal to examine and secure the original records, trusting to certified transcripts from a Territorial officer as to their genuineness and authenticity, notwithstanding it had been officially communicated by A Hamilton to the commission in the presence of the Keeper of the Public archives that and important erasure had been made in the letter of Governor Kindelan of the 4 June 1813 the inducement to the Royal order of the 29 March 1815 issued to authorize remuneration for military services—and when it was also within their knowledge that a grant of minor importance had been taken from the Keepers office & one of 16000 acres substituted—
4—The incorrect, preposterous, and injudicious determination that the claimants were entitled to have entered on the minutes of the commission whatever testimony they might produce and that the Commissioners had no right to interfer during the examination of a witness on the part of the claimant
5* The unqualified decision that grants to lands dated posterior to the 24 January 1818 not exceeding 3,500 acres were within the jurisdiction of the commission, notwithstanding they were declared by the treaty to be null and void—which was subsequently attempted to be evaded and denied
6" The repeated refusal to report the proceedings of the commission to Congress, anterior to the passage of any act, extending the term of the session and thus withholding from Congress information that was essential to correct and advised legislation
801867--57-61
<pb#968 />
7" The indelicacy of addressing a private letter to the Hon William H. Crawford giving an imperfect, insufficient and erroneous account of the circumstances of the commission dated 29 December
1823 * the same day the majority rejected a proposition to make an official report and keeping the inspection of the said letter from Alexander Hamilton until the 28 of January 1824—a few days anterior to the expiration of the term in virtue of which they were appointed
8" The incompatibility of engaging as counsel in suits at law, involveing conflicting interests arising out of adverse grants and especially in the case of John H. M*Intosh involving in its decission almost all the important principles necessary to be settled by the Commission, anticedent to the commencement of its adjudications and this practice, accompanied with the more extraordinary fact, that immediately previous to the examination of M*Intosh's case,”
the majority refused absolutely to establish any general principles to be referred to as governing the decisions of the Commission and in consequence Alexander Hamilton declined all responsible interference in the adjudications, and had the same recorded specially on the minutes.
9* The indelicate disregard to the confidential character of the Commission in an intention & deliberate determination to appoint any person who could conscientiously consider himself at liberty to take the prescribed oath of office,—while totally and entirely ignorant of the Spanish language and under which incompatible circumstances, they proposed to appoint Joseph B Lancaster, brother in law to William W Blair, for which purpose he had accompanied the majority from Kentucky and attempted to justify the measure on the precedent of a corresponding case in West Florida. In consequence of the objections from Alexander Hamilton the appointment was not made, who read to the majority and inquired distinctly and emphatically whether they thought the applicant could conscientiously take the oath of office. The commissioners seperated with an understanding that the appointment of a secretary should be the subject of future consideration—
The result was that the majority in persuance of a previous seperate arrangement appointed Francis J Fatio secretary to the commission,”
and Davis Floyd moved that an assistant should be appointed in order
<pb#969 />
FL OR I D A TERRITOR Y 947
to introduce Joseph B Lancaster to a participation of the emoluments of the office,” in correspondence with a bargain between Fatio and said Lancaster which motion was withdrawn at the suggestion of Alexander Hamilton that neither the law nor the occaision authorised such a measure The result however showed that neither consistency nor public obligation could prevent the appointment—
On the 3d August" on motion of Alexander Hamilton it was
“ordered, that only so much of the Spanish documents were required to be translated by the claiments as might be deemed essential to a fair understanding of the claims”
On the 5* August on motion of Davis Floyd it was resolved, that the claimants would not be required to produce translations of their title papers and that it should thenceforth be the duty of the secretary to furnish translations.” To this motion Alexander Hamilton dissented, and gave as his reason, the enevitable procrastination, of the business of the commission to the Sacrafice, of the public and private interests, at the same time suggesting as a more judicious course that an account be kept of the claimants expenses for the purpose of refering it to the consideration of Congress for reimbursement. The claimants objected to the expence and the majority decided in their favour. The consequence was that numerous applications were made by the claimants for permission to withdraw their papers in order to have them translated at their own expence.
It was impossible for the secretary to perform the duty imposed on him On the determination of the majority to have all Spanish documents translated by their secretary it was moved by Alexander Hamilton to appoint ex necessitate—Clerks qualified according to the provisions of the act of Congress which was rejected and Joseph B Lancaster appointed assistant secretary, at the suggestion of Francis J. Fatio, under the engagement for a division of the emoluments of the Office
10—The majority are charged with a perfect knowledge of all the above circumstances and consequent evasion and misrepresentation in stateing in their semi official letter to the secretary of the Treasury of the 29 December 1823 “that under the pressing circumstances of the commission the secretary had been required to employ an assistant which reduced his regular salary to a mere pittance and that it would be ungenerous and unjust to ask of him to employ another”—If the secretary performed his duty, the Commission had no right whatever might be the urgency or pressing character of the circumstances to require the secretary to employ an assistant at his own expence-
<pb#970 />
The law created the duty and affixed the salary at $1250, which my colleagues at the time they wrote their letter, beleived would amount to $2500 including fees, although unfortunately for their opinion Congress has thought other wise, if the necessity called for assistance the exercise of a sound discression would have been liberally advocated and no doubt sanctioned by the “generosity and magnanimity of Congress”—, and in this spirit was the proposition to appoint as many clerks as were necessary, properly qualified
11 The majority report as an excuse for requiring an additional clerk that one of the secretaries “was constantly employed in recording the evidence of title &c"—while they well knew that neither of the persons in the employment of the Commission were or ever had been so engaged and that as late as the 5" of February 1824 “the recording of the evidence of title &c"—had not commenced—It is now avered that the real cause was, that the embarrassments of the Commission arising out of the want of system required that an extraordinary effort should be made, in order to satisfy Congress that the Commission had not entirely misapplied its time
12 It is peculiar, and certainly did not create the most favourable impressions that in the private semi official letter of the 29 Dec 1823
any solicitude should be expressed to releive the claimants from the charge of fees, a communication which might not have been treated as a public letter as it commenced “Dear Sir,” while it was matter of record, that a resolution restraining the authority of the secretary, to collect the recording fees had not been concurred in.
13 The majority are charged with constructions of the acts of Congress, unwarranted by any equavocation or incongruity incident either to the reason, spirit or phaseology of the laws.
14 The majority represent to Congress, that it had been “their first business,” to examine and ascertain the law governing the distributions of the public lands, in order “to do justice with exactitude”—between the parties, while the minutes record, that the refusal to do so, was the ultimate cause that resolved Alexander Hamilton on the 20 Jan’ to withdraw from the adjudication”—This contradiction is further supported by the correspondence of Davis Floyd and Alex'
Hamilton of the 8 Jan 1824" written for the express purpose to pro-
<pb#971 />
duce some arrangement and corroborated by the majority in their letter of the 27 Jan 1824, addressed to A. Hamilton " and with his answer” transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury as will appear by refference to his letter dated Charleston 25 Feb. 1824.” The royal order of 1813 * had not been seen by the Commissioners anticedent to their adjudications and according to the report of the majority they had never inspected the ordinance of Governor Quesada of the 20
Nov 1790," which, if they had ever examined and understood they would not have subjected themselves to the charge of attempting to impose upon Congress in alleging that Gov. Quesada in his ordinance of 2 Sept 1790" referred to a royal order vesting him with plenary powers to dispose of the public lands
15—William W. Blair in his letter to R M Johnson Esqr.” states that in all cases where the claims exceeded 1000 acres and the claimants were not in actual possession, that they were ordered to be reported to Congress for thire consideration—On the 4 Feb' there was no such order and I venture to assert without having examined the minutes of the few subsequent days that no such order now exists and that such assertions is possitively contradicted in the list of reported cases. This representation in Excuse, arose out of a letter written by A Hamilton on this subject to the majority—
16 Davis Floyd is charged with being engaged in a suit at law, to recover for the heirs of Tait a tract of land, which had been forfeited from non possession, upon a contingent fee of $100, which said case he strenuously advocated before the Commission notwithstanding the majority had previously confirmed a claim in favour of the heirs of the said Tait given to the testator in lieu of the one forfeited and requested A Hamilton to interfere; who refused—as he had declined adjudicating with the majority—
17—It is extraordinary that William W. Blair's letter to the secretary of the Treasury * in which he represents that the fees charged for
<pb#972 />
recording the titles and evidence of the claims were burthensome to the claimants and requesting the secretary, to give his construction of the law in relation to the said charge should have the St. Augustine postmark of the 18" of November and endorsed by him on the outside
“copy” while the letter bears date the 7 of August previous and no other copy of the said letter has been received in the Treasury Department.”

<dochead>HOUSE REPORT RE LAND CLAIMS IN EAST FLORIDA</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 18 Cong., 1 sess.:AD 1]</source>
<place-time>[May 26, 1824]</place-time>
<docbody>The Committee on the public Lands to whom was referred the Message of the President of the United States with the report of Alexander Hamilton one of the Commissioners for ascertaining claims and titles to lands in Florida * have had the same under consideration and report, -That the Boards of Commissioners in Florida have been constituted in the mode usually adopted by the Government in similar cases where the Claims of Individuals were to be examined.—
In all legislation much must necessarily be left to construction and the sound discretion of those charged with the administration of the laws.—Had the mode of deciding claims and titles to Lands in Florida been new and the expediency or propriety of the system required to be tested by experiment your Committee might have been disposed to examine with more rigid scrutiny the laws to ascertain if some defect might not be discovered in them demanding the legislative interference of Congress and whether some other tribunal might not be constituted better adapted to the decision of these claims than the present board of commissioners.—
But knowing that similar tribunals have decided on the Claims of Individuals to Lands in all the States and Territories of the United States where such descisions were necessary and believing that the existing laws relative to the decision of claims in Florida are sufficient if properly administered your Committee feel no disposition to recommend either a change in the tribunal for descision or to add other legislative provisions to those allready in existence and which they believe sufficient if properly executed.—The Committee therefore recommed the adoption of the following resolutions
<pb#973 />
Resolved that the President of the United States be requested to cause to be prepared and transmitted to the Commissioners for the examination of Claims and titles to Lands in Florida such instructions touching their powers and the performance of their duties under the existing laws as he may deem necessary from an examination of the report of Alexander Hamilton one of the Commissioners and the report of the other two Cmmissioners for east Florida Resolved that the President of the United States be requested to adopt such measures as he may deem necessary for the safe keeping and security of the public records of the Spanish government in relation to Lands in Florida.

<place-time>U. S. Attorney's Office, W Florida PENSACOLA 26* May 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Not long Since I had the honor to address to you a communication in relation to some charges preferred against me at Washington for acts in my official capacity" & which as I then did & still do beleive originated in the worst motives. I regret Sir that I should be again under the necessity of troubling you upon a subject so unpleasing, but that duty which every individual in office owes to himself and to his government must from my apology, for I should be unworthy of the station which I have the honor to hold—and the government would act unjustly to the community to retain me in office were I in any degree capable of the acts ascribed to me by my inveterate enemies and accusers. Having been advised within a short period by the worthy Delegate from this Territory that my defence &c—had been received at Washington & that as he beleived I had nothing to fear from the malignant attacks of my Enemies which had been made before the President, I spoke here of these advices with some gratification of heart, and when this had reached them, either thro my remarks, or the advices of their Agents at Washington—my answers were not long in renewing their assaults upon me apparently with renewed vigor. Aware that if an entire failure of their attack at Washington should ensue that the blow must recoil upon themselves and that the respectable part of the community were beginning to manifest an honest indignation at the manifestly unmerited persecution lavished upon an officer who was only obnoxious to them on account of a determined discharge of his duty, they deemed it essential in order to save themselves first to attempt to blacken the character of that officer by reports & suggestions and eventually to organize a formal
<pb#974 />
attack upon him in the shape of charges, in the support of a rule of Court entered against him to shew cause why he should not be suspended or expelled as an Attorney from the Bar; and these charges exhibited too in a Court the Judge of which had long been known as his avowed enemy—these charges preferred, & supported by the evidence, of Individuals whom that officer had been compelled officially to prosecute—and being moreover principally the very charges which had been before preferred by them at Washington which they apprehended without any hope of success—Being fully confident that the avowed hostility of the Judge to the officer charged would insure their success before him, & enable them to make as formidable an array as could be wished—the proceeding was taken (as I am advised)
for the purpose of being forwarded to the President to secure their success there, as well as to sustain themselves with the Publick here, &
it is for this reason Sir, that I have made the present communication—
without waiting to be informed whether their despatch has yet been forwarded.—The only additional charge to those first made against me to the President upon which I deem it necessary to touch at this time, is one which if true, should itself destroy me, but which is
“baseless as the fabric of a vision”—viz' that of having embezzled the money of my Clients—”.—The facts Sir, are briefly these, -while acting as an attorney in Georgia, and having in my hands at times debts for collections to the amount of perhaps Forty thousand dollars there was a collection made by me for a Mr. W. I. Hobby of Georgia for several hundred Dollars, and without collecting to it I assumed the responsibility to him upon another Paper of his placed in my hands to the amount of several hundreds more. Being in flourishing & successful business—& connected in the 6th Circuit Court of the U. States with an eminent Lawyer & in the continued receipt of large sums of money for Clients & others, instead of making (as strict prudence would have dictated) the Bank my place of Deposit, I was my own Banker, & without suspecting in the least my situation, I found myself unable to meet at the proper moment Mr. Hobby's demand—I
exerted myself then and since to effect that object—a train of unexpected misfortunes in a pecuniary way have since prevented and Mr. Hobby thought proper to bring suit against me in the Court of this District & judgment was promptly confessed—for neither now or ever have I felt aught but as honor would dictate in relation to this claim and the mention of this incident in the rule spoken of is the offspring of the purest malice & is moreover a charge that wou'd never have have been preferred—by Mr H. himself in relation to his claim.
Pardon Sir this perhaps unnecessary extension—and I will only add that (if deemed necessary) I will forward by the next mail the Documents in relation to this proceeding—and any evidences or explanations afterwards which may be required by the Department. I
<pb#975 />
request Sir that if you should deem it proper or necessary this letter be laid before the President."

<place-time>NEW YORK June 4* 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In accordance with the wishes of the Executive, I take the liberty to make the following communication, in reference to the resolution of the House of Representatives, requesting “the President to adopt such measures as he may deem necessary, for the safe keeping
17 Ante, p. 925.
18 Ante, p. 939.
<pb#987 />
and security of the Public Records of the Spanish Government, in relation to lands in Florida” ”
These documents consist of the memorials, concessions, orders of survey, surveys, and confirmatory titles, in the possession of the Keeper of the Public archives, in his official character; and of the official correspondence of the Spanish authorities, the royal orders and gubernatorial edicts, placed by the State Department, in charge of William Reynolds, Antonio Alvarez, and John Cavada. These papers are kept in loose sheets, without any descriptive list, or record memoanda of their existance—
The necessity of securing, without delay the original title papers, has become the more important since the issue of office transcripts of the concession, and confirmatory titles, by which every disadvantage is transferred to the United States, in the event of any loss—Some of these documents are of so gross a character that they ought on the slightest inspection to be pronounced forgeries. The official correspondence, royal orders, and edicts, are of a still more delicate character, and on the preservation of these depends the ability to estimate, to what extent, the governors possessed power to dispose of the public lands, and consequently, how far the United States are bound by their acts—The letters of the Florida governors are original drafts, in many instances interlined, subject to fraudulent alterations without the means of detection, acquiring their validity and authenticity from their relative associate situation—
In consideration of the importance and peculiar situation of these public Records, I recommend Edward R. Gibson and William Simmons, as entitled to the confidence of the Government, in order to carry into effect, any measures the President may deem proper to adopt—
Whoever may be appointed ought to be instructed to deposit all the official papers, having connection with the disposition of the public lands in trunks, and to engage as many persons as can be judiciously employed in taking transcripts; the title records to be copied in such convenient form, as to admit of their being bound together, to compose a territorial Book of Records—There ought to be an alpabetical arrangement of the Grants, with an appropriate index, and the originals appertaining to each associated, labelled, and correspondently scheduled—The transcripts to be deposited with the Keeper of the Public Archives, and the originals to be guarded, to await the future disposition of Congress. The originals of the documents accompanying my report are in the office of the Commission, and, like all other papers, subject to improper inspection. Of theese there were thirty five brought before the Commission, by a subpoena duces tecum and retained in opposition to M Blair, in order to have them transcribed, * House Journal, 18 Cong., 1 sess., p. 592. 
<pb#988 />
the expense of which did not exceed thirty dollars—M Floyd was in Indiana-
In the confidence that this business will be the subject of a more rigid legislative examination, I refrain, for the present, from entering into a more minute explanation of the inducements for a prompt and efficient interference, to guard all the public records from every irresponsible intrusion.
In as much as I have embarked every responsibility in the perfection of this examination, I should be pleased to have an opportunity to superintend the translation and arrangement of the royal orders, edicts and official correspondence, which it is in my power to do to advantage, as I possess some acquaintance with the Spanish language—
It will at all times afford me much satisfaction to give any information that may be in my possession—I have understood that Mess"
Blair and Floyd are still adjudicating; would it not be adviseable that they report their proceedings? otherwise, the government, by the translation of M* Blair to the judiciary, will be deprived of the means of ascertaining upon what principles they have decided, and consequently the whole will have to be done over *—And the Commission, as now constituted, ought to make a similar report on the 1*November next, to be laid before Congress at the commencement of the approaching session.”
I have the honor to remain with much respect Your Ob H Sev"
ALEXANDER HAMILTON
HON: JOHN Q. ADAMS-Secretary of State—
The document, on which Burgewain claims 16,000 acres of land, is so palpably a forgery, and the original in the possission of the Commission, that, if it have been recommended for confirmation, the Commissioners are not entitled to any continuation of confidence—
This paper ought to be secured—To Gibson & Simmons all communications ought to be confidential, until executed.”

<docbody>SIR—By the last mail I had the honor to address you * upon the subject of some very ignominious and most groundless charges preferred against me by infamous men here and countenanced by my enemy the Judge to effect the objects which their previous attacks had failed to attain, viz, my removal from office.—Since my last communication the most high handed measures have been resorted to by the Judge, I have been by him imprisoned and fined & thus seriously interrupted in the discharge of my official duties as Attorney of the U States.—I had applied, in time for their transmission by this mail for copies of the opinions and judgments pronounced by the District Judge in the respective cases, but they have not been as yet furnished (whether through intentional delay or not I am ignorant)
so that I shall be compelled to postpone my despatch upon the subject until the ensuing week.—The conduct of the Judge has been so extraordinary that I should deem it to be my official duty (if self defence did not require it) to report his course throughout in these matters and I trust that the documents & proofs—which will be forwarded will go sufficiently to prove that his course well merits reprehension & demands an investigation for the good of the community.

<place-time>CHARLESTON, So C 15 June 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I have the honor of transmitting you a survey of the Indian boundary line in Florida, to the extent completed by me, with a sketch of the Country embraced within the limits of the reservation made In my previous letters of the 27 Jan" from Cantonment Brooke,”
and of the 20" of March from St Augustine; * I have expressed to you my opinion as to the capability of the Country for sustaining the Indian population to be provided for in Florida, and have in detail given my reasons for extending the north line as conditionally agreed upon—I was the more confirmed in the opinion as expressed above from ascertaining the fact that the Indian population in Florida had been greatly exagerated and that the number to be contentrated South would not probably exceed 2500 or 3000—The good lands adapted to the purposes of agriculture and which are productive in rice, corn, and the esculent roots, are principally high & low hammocks, and lay in detached spots of greater or less magnitude; surrounded by extensive districts of elevated or flat pine lands, valuable for the grazing of stock, or as hunting grounds—The combining the three objects of agriculture, stock & hunting will therefore, within the

<pb#993 />
limits allotted, furnish more than an abundant supply of the subsistence of life for a greater Indian population than the one contemplated—To agriculture however necessity only can force the Indians, and it is not to be expected, in a country like Florida not yet exhausted of game, that the earth will be cultivated by the savage to a greater extent than to supply the deficiency of the chase or the bread part of subsistence—Time only can innovate on deep rooted prejudices & where change is necessary, it will naturally be to that condition most assimilated to the one to be abandoned—The character of the herdsman approaches to that of the hunter, and in a country favourable to the raising of stock the efforts of the Indian may be the more easily directed to that channel—The Indians in Florida have long known how to appreciate these advantages; the wars in which they have been engaged have however impoverished their resourses;
& suspended their energies—Restore confidence—ensure protection—
and steadily persevere in the annual distributions of stock of cattle
& hogs contemplated, and within a few years the Florida Indians will be among the number of the best conditioned of the aborigines of America—
The Hammocks of best character, and of greatest extent are to be found at Okahumky—Negro settlements at Withlacouchy Creek &
Pelacklekaha—Checuchatty—near the sourses of Hillsborough river—
and on Peace Creek & its tributaries—In addition to these hammocks, the banks of Pear Creek, from its sourse in a large pond for 15 miles south, furnishes a body of 2" rate pine land elevated and productive—
There are two Indian villages in this district of pines, the condition of which are favourable evidences of the productiveness of the soil and healthiness of the country—The settlements will necessarily be confined to the above districts of hammocks & pine land, a circumstance to be considered favourable, as it must lead to such a concentration of population as will render a judicious location of the agency practicable, and ensure to the agent greater facilities for protecting the interests of the Indian—The balance of the Country can only be appropriated to grazing and hunting grounds; the latter confined to the south east & west and to be visited only during the season favourable for the chase—
It will be perceived, as previously reported, that the western line terminated south in one of those extensive savannahs peculiar to Florida and which are known as the great Indian hunting grounds—
Beyond that no line could have been traced for the want of objects to mark, and it was very doubtful whether the country from its character could have been traversed, independent of its being alike deficient in water & wood—My party therefore retrogaded from Charlottes harbor north, by a more eastern route than the one by which we descended, and surveyed & marked the north line as recommended
<pb#994 />
to be extended—From its Eastern extremity, the propriety of adopting the ocklewaha river to its sourse as a boundary is respectfully suggested, and from thence in a direction so as to close with the eastern line aggreed on in the treaty—The red dots exhibit this line as proposed to be run; the reasons for not marking which have been explained in a previous communication I would recommend the survey of this line the Early part of the ensuing winter; as important, not only in designating the Indian limits East, but as calculated to add much to the geographical information of this hitherto unknown country—
The season was unfavourable for marking the boundaries of the land allotted the Indian Chiefs in the Middle district of Florida—The reservations for Econchatemeco, and Nehemathla have been defined as agreed upon, but the spring floods had so innundated the swamps of the Appalachicola as to prohibit any but an incomplete survey of the reservations for Blunt, Cochran & Mullato King—To prevent however any disturbance which might arrise from the ignorant encroachments of Emigrants I have marked lines (at a distance so as to designate the direction ef extent of the North & south boundary)
from the edge of the swamp to their probable termination west-
When the waters subside, and the swamp of the Appalachicola can be measured it will be an easy operation to complete the survey as originally contemplated—
I was disappointed of the opportunity of a personal consultation
(agreeably to your request) with Governor Duval as to the measures best calculated to ensure a Speedy & economical execution of the terms of the treaty—I fully expected, (from a conference held with Co! Humphreys, at Okahumky) to have met him & the Governor at Tallahassee, but circumstances appear to have detained them both longer at Pensacola than contemplated—I embraced however an opportunity of writing the Governor on the Subject; for my views on which I refer you to a copy of a letter enclosed-
In a communication to you from the Commissioners authorized to treat with the Florida Indians; you were advised of the fact that the treaty was in a measure one of imposition—That the terms were such as policy dictated—as the prosperity & security of Florida seemed to demand—Concentration within any limits was not agreeable to a population possessing singularly repulsive characteristics-
Foreign & native—Hostile and submissive—Refugees from the four Southern tribes and scattered over the whole face of Florida from the Appalachecola to the Cape—To bring together these discordant materials, to reconcile them to the same or any territorial limits was the operation of authority only, to which from their condition they would necessarily yield, but to which they would exhibit opposition so long as it could have any influence—They finally submitted to
<pb#995 />
the terms of a treaty as the most favourable they could secure for themselves; & to which, by a steady course of undeviating policy, there is no difficulty of ultimately reconciling them—A restlessness of disposition (improperly publickly noted as hostile) has however manifested itself, and which has been principally encouraged under a hope that the arrangements made were not final, but that some more favourable change might be effected—The injudicious protest against the treaty (dictated it appears in ignorance of facts) on the part of some of the Settlers near the Appalachicola—The unavoidable delay attending the execution of the treaty—and the unlicenced conversations of designing men with some of the chiefs have all operated to produce the impressions adverted to; but which have in a great measure been dissipated by the running & marking of the boundary lines—The Indians are therefore preparing for a fate which they would silently submit to if deemed unavoidable; but if the most distant encouragement is given they will redouble their efforts to defeat a location in which is involved the prosperity of Florida—If the Indian population in Florida could be removed to some other country;
national policy would approve the measure; but if removal be impracticable the only alternative left is the most judicious location, within proper limits & under such government as to ensure their dependance
& discipline—The least objectionable location is, in my opinion, the one which has been selected—It is central, cut off from the sea coast, and capable of being in time encircled by a white population—It is in a part of the territory so situated as not to interpose an Indian population between civilized districts—The country contains a sufficient quantity of good land for agricultural purposes; in spots sufficiently detached so as to prevent the too great vicinity of villages, objectionable to the savage; the whole encircled with the most extensive grounds alike favourable for hunting & the grazing of cattle, It is a country illy adapted to a white population; but possessing advantages valuable only to a savage, in the uninterrupted enjoyment of which he may rest secure for centuries—Under this belief as expressed; the sooner the Indians can be advised of their fate, and concentrated within the limits allotted; the sooner, in my opinion, will all apprehensions of hostilities on our southern border vanish;
Florida recover from the embarrassments under which she has hitherto labored—and an enterprising population induced to improve the advantages of her climate & soils, which can alone ensure the national objects for which the purchace from Spain was made *

<place-time>US Attorneys office, W. F. 18" June 1824–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I had the honor to address you on the 26" of the last month”
upon the subject of the renewed attack made upon me here with the countenance of the Court and its officers & which & which as I was then informed was intended expressly for effect at Washington. Since then the suggestion has been confirmed by the order of the Judge requiring the Clerk to transmit to the President copies of all the evidences brought forward to support the charges preferred against me by Rule together with the opinion or judgment rendered by Judge Brackenridge.” I have again to express my regret Sir that my duty impels me to trouble the Govt with the detail of proceedings so very unpleasing, & I will add that the only inducement which I can have ever again to address the Departmt upon this affair will be a requisition to produce the evidences which I shall advert to & proffer in the course of this despatch.
For I shall rather determine to resign my office ere long, if, conscious of my innocence, and enabled to prove it amply, I am yet to be incessantly harassed with a bitter persecution which altho' it may not impose upon me either disgrace or ruin, is yet sufficient by its dark attacks & continued vexations almost to dispel each gleam of happiness, and (from the peculiar situation of myself & opponents being judicial officers) instead of giving room for any manly redress to denote me to silent anxiety & helpless resentment.—It has been well remarked by some writer, that no oppression is so heavy or lasting as that which is inflicted by the perversion & exorbitance of legal authority & truly Sir I have in this matter sadly realized the verity of this observation. I would not without great cause & a sense of imperious duty, & then ever with regret, point to a stain upon the proverbially spotless ermine of the Bench, but Sir I am constrained to say that it will be here fully manifested that the bosom of a Judge is not inaccessible (as it should be) to the fierce feelings of private malignity, but that the most settled enmity has in this instance pervaded official action.—
That my hitherto unassailed character as a member of the Bar of the highest Courts of three States, as well as of three Federal Courts together with my station, and the consciousness on the part of the Judge, that he himself, & every individual concerned in this matter, were my violent personal enemies, that all this should not have prevented the iniquitous course adopted towards me must doubtless occasion astonishment, & indeed is only to be accounted for by the belief that prudence has with them been blinded by passion—&
<pb#997 />
the fact that a plot in which the Judge has been concerned was long since formed to remove me from office at all hazards, or rather to compel the President so to do, & this fact is here well understood–
I will premise Sir that the Rule (N° 1)" was entered during my absence from the Court, without any notice to me whatever, &
placed upon the Record not being supported by affidavit or any kind of proof, but upon the simple suggestion of a man of very bad character, whom (as the Judge knew) I had been compelled to prosecute for serious offences. Upon the following morning I moved the court upon several grounds to expunge the Rule from the Record, &
among other grounds were the above named, and the additional one, that as under the Judiciary Act of [blank] the District Judges were not allowed to preside in any cause in which they had been of counsel for either party, or were in any way interested * & I then calmly &
respectfully submitted to the Court whether this case did not come within the reason of the law, when I stated that I was prepared to prove by the most respectable witnesses the enmity of the presiding Judge to myself, and his friendship for the accuser. An order was instantly entered by command of the Judge (Brackenridge) to imprison me for three hours for a contempt, before the three hours had elapsed, the Marshal came again however to the prison, & required me to accompany him & appear in court, which I declined to do upon a verbal command, & required of him some authority—& whether any other entry had been made upon the Record than the original order of imprisonment—the reply being that he had only a verbal order, & that no remission of the imprisonment or any change of the order had been made upon the Record I persisted in my refusal to depart until the expiration of the three hours—unless some proper authority was shewn—, whereupon I was ordered to be brought by posse which was done, and on being brought into court was fined fifty dollars for contempt in not coming at once from the prison, (to which I had been sent by an order of Record,) and was committed to the Marshal until fine paid which was promptly done by my indignant fellow citizens, I was refused a hearing in my defence (a liberty allowed to the worst criminal elsewhere) & was in short literally gagg'd in court until an immediate adjournment took place. An affidavit for a remission of the fine (N° 2)" was then for experiment offer'd, which was refused to be filed or considered for a moment by the court.
<pb#998 />
Upon a renewal of the motion to expunge the Rule, the motion was refused to be entered & the Judge merely required the accuser
(J L W*) (several days after placing the Rule on Record) to make oath that to the best of his knowledge & belief the changes (not the specifications N° 3)” in the Rule were to the best of his knowledge
& belief &c, true which he of course readily deposed—and the evidences were accordingly marshalled organized & arranged—& the testimony has been as I learn (for really I knew so well the result was fixed ere it began that I deemed it folly to strive with this Judge) taken down and prepared in that way which might best subserve their purposes at Washington. I need not here say more with regard to the actors in this business than that they are all close friends & partizans with each other and thorough enemies to myself—as shall be proved when required. With regard to the Judge Col W" Barnett's affidavit *
heretofore transmitted may be referred to with propriety on this head.—I will Sir recur as briefly as possible to the several charges advanced as seen in N° 1 & 2—& in relation to the first charge & the two specifications it may be remarked that they are not only utterly false, but suggested & preferred without the knowledge wish or consent of Mr Graham or Mr Hobby who would have disdained to make against me so foul & unfounded an accusation.—In the case of Mr Hobby—about five hundred dollars were collected by me (while practising in Georgia) & the remainder due upon a note placed by Mr H in my hands for collection was never collected but was assumed by me, on account of a leniency shewn to the debtor (a most worthy man) in not bringing suit against him, & I was thus induced to accept securities from him & give a receipt as if for monies received, when in fact I had never received them. Presuming that at the proper moment I should be prepared to account with any client (my pecuniary resources being then ample) I was not in this, nor indeed in other like instances careful as was my duty, to keep seperate my private and professional business, & I was unhappy enough to be rendered unable by sudden & heavy losses to meet the just demands of Mr H
and several other clients, but that I even for a moment intended to do them any wrong or injustice is an utter fabrication, & I can refer to the first names in Georgia for the support of this declaration.—As to the petty case of Mr Graham—it is in every respect a more shameless perversion of truth, than almost any of which I could before have conceived. I am prepared to prove whenever necessary that I never act as Attorney in a Justice's court that in this case I acted for a friend of old standing & that he never had the slightest thought of passing blame upon me in any way & on the other hand expressed his
<pb#999 />
obligations for my attention to this business but of all this my persecutors were ignorant or regardless. As to the second charge & the specifications I will observe that the first specif"—that of altering the Record by interlining the names of Louis & Manuel is the same which has been already once made to the President, which was as I trust placed in a proper light by the worthy Foreman of the Grand Jury at the term to which the charge refers in his letter heretofore sent to the Department." Having been since called upon to act as U S Atty upon the Recognizance taken against myself for the above act, to which Recogniz” I was ordered by the individual accuser J L Williams acting as Justice—I moved the court to appoint a publick prosecutor pro hac vice, which was (with much apparent reluctance) declined, inasmuch as the publick indignation on this subject was quite manifest
& the witnesses were then at my request sent by the Court itself before the Grand Jury at the late May Term (of which body Mr Twitchell was also Foreman) who promptly rejected the charge—and yet after this the Judge aware of the constitutional tribunal of the country having passed upon it & knowing that this very charge had been ineffectually made & was spurned as an infamous fiction by every honorable man in this community proceeded to hear evidence on this matter & to intimate his opinion that the Attorney of the U States had in this matter committed forgery. In this & others of the charges which assert the commission of offenses by the writer—it will be seen that the Judge has utterly disregarded the right of trial by jury &
taken the law into his own hands "I need hardly remark that evidence of a more settled resolve to use all the force of official power to effect unmerited and wanton injury & cause injustice could scarcely be adduced in human annals. I beleive with sincerity that there was no man who heard this proceedure but who was impelled from honest impulse to ejaculate as well in this instance as at the time of the imposition of the fine of fifty dollars. “Grossius hac Rhadamanthus habet durissima regna”—As to the four additional specifications made they are alike shameful untruths without the shadow of foundation. In respect to alterations of Indictments I have ever exercised my official discretion under the laws with integrity and have never in any instance illegally changed the form of any indictment as any honorable man who knows me will beleive.
As to the third charge and the specification under it—it becomes only necessary to say that I am and ever have been incapable of such an act & that the deposition of M" Scott can be at any time obtained to prove the utter falsity of this accusation. In reference to the fourth charge &c it may be remarked that the charge is the same heretofore preferred against me before the President, and that in each
<pb#1000 />
case cited I shall be fully enabled to prove whenever it is required that good grounds for prosecution existed that indeed prosecutions were well deserved.
For the fifth charge & fourth specification a deposition can at any time be filed to prove that every material fact was correctly stated in the News paper Publication " there spoken of that it was in self defence & in answer to a most wicked & wanton attack made upon me in a publication in a preceding paper in which last communication was contained an intemperate & personal opinion of the Judge pronounced against me in Court & which scarcely could be called a legal opinion—The second specification &c as to a pretended Law report will more properly be the subject of a separate communication *
having been acted upon by a separate rule against me, altho' in the first instance embodied in the charge—The third & fourth specifications under the 5" charge relate to matters which as well as the others are replied to in the answer (N° 4)* filed in Court.—In reference to the conversation at the Commercial Hotel which respected the private deportment of H. M. Breckenridge as a Citizen generally—and as respected the Speaker (W. F. Steele) specially, it was spoken of in terms of great severity—but as was beleived with a severity not unmerited by his dishonorable & unprincipled deportment as an Individual, and even as a Judge to wound a man who had never ijured him—but the term court or aught like it was never mentioned. And indeed it is a unique case that for such a conversation a contempt should be alleged—As to the fourth specification by adverting in argument on the motion to expunge the rule &c to the Judiciary Act this has been before discussed and is more fully shewn in the answer
(N° 4) before named—After the evidence had been closed & my answer had been heard I stated to the Court that I was prepared to make an affidavit if required that every material fact should be disproved by evidence at the next term if a decision upon the rule was postponed until that time. Upon discovering however that it was resolved by the court to make a final decision at all hazards and indeed that any thing I could say had I possessed the tongue of an Angel would not avail me. I desisted and the Judge then pronounced an opinion the most oblique & untrue which I have ever heard from a Judge & more clearly indicative of malicious feeling than I had supposed even this Judge would venture which opinion was accompanied
41 Ante, p. 875.
42 Post, p. 981.
<pb#1001 />
with a sentence as annexed (N° 5.)* The determination of Judge B.
was as I have no doubt when the rule was entered to order my removal as U. S. Attorney &c—as well as in the capacity of a private practitioner but the enormity of this attempt after they beleived the failure of the same attempt already made at Washington was too palpable and the public displeasure being somewhat evident on this account they desisted—I use the term “they” in this matter Sir, because it is at this time evident to all candid men here & is I beleive entirely susceptible of proof—that H. M. Breckenridge, J. M. White, John Innerarity, John Miller, William Sebree, John L. Williams, Henry Grandpre, W" H. Hunt—N. S. Parmentier—and a number of minor personages whom I have found it my duty to prosecute in the course of my official progress—are formed as a combination to destroy me in any manner however indefensible. Were it necessary Sir I could readily adduce proofs of the utter destitution of principle & almost infamy of character of most of the members of this league—As to the style & the matter of the opinion which is as I suppose by this time transmitted to the department of State—I cannot bring myself to comment upon it specially least I should purchance forget that calmness which is due to the authority to which I address myself—Yet I
cannot deem it my duty to avoid altogether the notice of some few points in the opinion which are such wide departures from the verity of the case, and which proceeding from such a source as that of an U. S. Dist. Judge might unexplained carry some small authority. In several instances the Judge alludes to my deportment in Court which he asserts has been often insulting & offensive, whereas I shall be able fully to prove that my manner altho' ardent has never been as stated—and that altho' ardent has never been as stated—and that altho’ I had a perfect knowledge of the Judge's devoted enmity & of all those he could influence I have yet always acted to him with professional courtesy. It is susceptible of proof that I have been frequently prevented from arguing a case for my publick or private Clients—& been commanded to silence without the slightest reason, and when I have respectfully asserted my rights and demanded to be heard have been either threatened with imprisonment or actually imprisoned.—
The assertion of the Judge in the Opinion that he is not nor has been ever my enemy &c—when contrasted with the affidavit of Col.
Barnet before named and with his declaration in the said opinion that it is very natural he should be my indignant enemy on account of my conduct to him must really excite astonishment when it is known
<pb#1002 />
that numerous affidavits of the most respectable Witnesses could be adduced to prove his devoted hostility—As to the numerous wicked suggestions of his belief against me contained in the Opinion of my running as he terms it before Mayor's, Justices &c—to insure the emoluments of office &c—of my having never denied the correctness of the charge against me in the case of Graham &c—of my conduct in Mr. Hobby's case & my denial of the debt on the receipt of money
& of the groundlessness of many prosecutions instituted by me against J. L. Williams & others—of my inducing M" Scott to act improperly—
of my asserting that I should file information because the Grand Jury refused to find Bills &c—and many other assertions made in the Opinion—I can only remark, with due deference to the department—that I solemnly declare them to be the most unfounded &
iniquitous misrepresentations & undue suggestions thro' out which could have been devised by the most perverse malice—I will merely remark as to the comments of the Judge in the part of the opinion relating to the alleged alteration of the Record in the case of the Coulons before spoken of—in which the words Manuel & Louis were inserted & to which the letter of the Foreman T. Twitchell Esq.
heretofore sent had relation *—I must declare that I have been shocked at the utter destitution of correctness & feeling in this part of the opinion—where the Judge could remark “that the refusal of the Grand Jury (whose Foreman M* Twitchell was Foreman also at the last term &c.) to find against me ought after they had fully examined the case at my request—was no evidence of innocence—&c that this was my doctrine &c”—I must believe that this circumstance alone will stamp the character of his conduct to me—and will shew with what candor or honor the opinion is delivered in other respects as well as this—It is notorious (& the Judge knew it) that in regard to this plot got up between John Innerarity (brother in law of the Coulons) & Mr. J. L. Williams (the magistrate who recognized me) to charge me with forgery in defacing an Indictment by inserting the words Manuel & Louis it is notorious that every honest man in this community has viewed & still views it as one of the most shocking and infamous attempts to pervert the laws to the injury of an Individual which has ever been developed—And as to the Judge's intimacy with this M. J. L. Williams and partiality for him it is here well known.—
In conclusion Sir I will observe that I shall when required send such evidences as it may be intimated and necessary but shall otherwise omit to address the department again on this subject and shall endeavor in the earnest discharge of my official duties as usual to forget that base conspiracy which has been so earnestly directed against
<pb#1003 />
me—I can safely say Sir that I care less for the office (which is by no means so valuable as to induce me to forego all happiness by a long retention of it after their plans are defeated, amid a circle of Lynx eyed and tyger hearted enemies) than is my care for the honor of my Country in seeing a base conspiracy of bad men effect by wicked ingenuity—the unmerited prostration of an officer of Government who is to them obnoxious—I shall rest Sir contented to await any advices on this subject from Washington, and shall only request (if deemed necessary) that this communication be laid before the President of the U. States. I had intended at this time to give a history of my most illegal fine & imprisonment for publishing a true account of the proceedings of Judge B. in a matter at the last term but I will take leave Sir to postpone it until the ensuing week when I will make a brief communication on the subject *

Although every disposition is felt by the President and him, to extend to Edmund Gage, the Captain of the Cygnet, the full benefit of the noli prosequi, which you have entered on the prosecution against that Wessel for a violation of the Laws prohibiting the Slave trade, yet it would seem according to the opinion of the Attorney General, who has been consulted upon the subject, that this cannot now be done, with regard to the qui tam action which has been instituted by Collector Rodman against him; the question whether the President by noli prosequi, or otherwise, can bar the Collectors remedy in such a case, being now a point for adjudication by the Supreme Court of the United States, and undecided, upon appeal actually pending before that Court, Captain Gage can only therefore have recourse, and it is to be hoped, not in vain, to the Collector's lenity, for the relief which he solicits of the Executive authority.

pronounced by the Court—and the rule absolute (N° 3) entered *—
A copy of the opinion would have been forwarded forthwith but I
was not enabled to procure it to be forwarded by this mail—It can be made to appear and I shall indeed feel it my duty whenever required so to do to establish by the best depositions that the facts stated in the Report are true & correct—and that it was but their truth which rendered them obnoxious to the Court.—The penalties to which I have been subjected in defending that which has been ever well considered as one of the most invaluable rights secured by the Constitution of my Country are to myself deemed trifles—but when the violation of Constitutional right, the infringement of a Freeman's noblest privilege—the tyranny of a judicial Officer in the wanton and unjust oppression of a Citizen are considered—the view is changed and it becomes a matter of more importance, and I cannot persuade myself but that a conduct so flagrantly wrong will meet in some way a proper notice from the Government. For the publication which was a report handed by me to the Editor (who was likewise imprisoned)
it was done in conformity with my impressions of my duty as a Publick officer—deprecating the unfounded and till then unheard of principle assumed by the Judge—that he had the control of the presentments of a Grand Jury for at the time it was never intimated even by the Judge that the document was intended as an unofficial Act of the Grand Jury.
I have intended sir in this matter throughout to act upon correct principles—the fine and imprisonment have been endured by me with cheerfulness, and I only indulge a hope that the developement of this affair may ever prevent a repetition of such high oppression in this Country.”

of public property surrendered by the Spanish Authorities of West Florida to Governor Jackson," and by him forwarded to the Department of State, to be enclosed to us. To that Letter we have received no answer. We consider it an important Document in the discharge of the duties of our Commission, and rendered still more so since the date of that Letter, as most of the public Lots, scites of forts, batteries, and buildings are now covered by private claims that we have strong reasons to believe are fraudulent, and of recent origin. When Governor Jackson left here there was a copy in some office of the province, which has been purloined, destroyed, or lost, besides the copy that was forwarded to your Department. We understand another copy was sent to the Quarter Master General, to whom we have also written on the Subject.” The property in question is of considerable value to the Government.
Our colleague, Major Overton, has been indefatigably employed in business ever since the organization of the Board, until his health became so much impaired, it was thought adviseable to take a trip to Tennessee for a few months. The undersigned, however, are now constantly engaged in the examination of the claims, and there will be no suspension, or delay, in the operations of the Board in consequence of his absence.”

<place-time>Pensacola, FLORIDA, June 25" 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, Private claims for some of the grounds which have been heretofore considered as in the possession of the military, particularly the scite of the old Barracks & a small Battery in Pensacola, having been filed before the land Commissioners for West Florida now in Session in this City, I request, if such a document be in your office, you will be pleased to furnish me with it, in order that I may know what public buildings or lots were turned over by the Spanish authorities when Gen' Jackson received possession of the province.
Capt. Thornton "informs me that Major Staunton " did not furnish him with a copy when he left the Station, hence there is none on file in this Office. A list of this property it is understood was lodged in the Office of the Secretary of State for the Territory, or in the Mayor's Office of the City, but it is now either lost or mislaid. The original I presume is in the Office of the Secretary of State at Washington.
If a copy of that however is not to be procured, & Major Staunton should not have forwarded one to your office, I think it probable he may yet have it in his possession.—
On the subject of public buildings in Pensacola, I beg leave to represent for your information, that the blockhouses now occupied as Storehouses are all situated in the streets of the City, and that two of them occupy positions in the centre of one of the principal streets, to the injury & inconvenience of persons owning lots & living immediately in the rear of them. During the winter the City authorities requested of me to abandon these, but afterwards withdrew the application, supposing something would be done in Congress relative to the public lots & buildings in the City.—I would therefore respectfully suggest the propriety & expediency of abandoning these two to the City Authorities, provided they will remove them at their expense, and reserving
<pb#1009 />
such part of the materials of which they are built as may be of use in the Quartermaster's Department; & that the buildings on the Hospital lot be repaired for Storehouses,—with Soldiers as carpenters it can be done at a comparatively small expense. This lot & buildings ought, in my opinion, to be retained in any event, by the Government, for Storehouses, as it is more conveniently situated as it regards business than any other public or even private lot in the City. It is considered the most valuable lot in the City, by every person, for any kind of mercantile business. There is one Blockhouse standing apart near the Shore at the upper end of the City occupied by me as a Storehouse, the one occupied as a custom house, and also the Government house, which do not interfere in the least with the convenience of any one on the arrangement of the City;—I would recommend therefore, that they continue to be appropriated for their present purposes.”—
I have the honor to be Sir, with perfect respect Y' Mo. Ob. Serv"
