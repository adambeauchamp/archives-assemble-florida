<docbody>COL” ROB" BUTLER, near Nashville, Tennessee.
SIR. I have the honor in compliance with directions from the President of the US. to enclose a Commission of Surveyor of the Public Lands in Florida, to which office he has appointed you." It will be necessary for you to take an oath of office, and enter into bond with security for the faithful performance of your duties, the forms of which are herewith forwarded. When executed you will forward them to this Office with a certificate endorsed upon the bond, by the Judge or District Attorney of the US. that the security is sufficient.
The 6* Section of the Act approved the 8” of May 1822, authorizes the appointment of a Surveyor for Florida and designates his power and authority;" the 13 Section of the Act approved the 3'd of March 18237 repeals the 6th Section of the Act of the 8th of May 1822, but the 4th Section of the Act approved the 4th of May
1824,” must be so construed, to give effect to the intention of Congress, as not only to authorize the appointment of a surveyor, but to invest him with the powers and authority and impose upon him the duties which are invested in, and required of him by the 6* Section of the Act of the 8” of May 1822, with the exception of the authority to charge fees for recording the plats and the surveys of private claims, the surveying of these will be provided for, it is presumed when Congress shall finally act upon the report of the Commissioners. The object of your immediate appointment is to have surveyed with as little delay as possible, a body of land adjacent to the Seat of Goverment which is located in Gadsden C* and within which tract of Country it is understood that there are but few, if any, private claims.
The 6* Section of the Act of the 8th of May 1822 invests the Surveyor authorized to be appointed by the President with the same power and authority as by law appertains to the Surveyor South of the State of Tennessee—In relation therefore to the duties of your Office generally, I beg leave to refer you to the Act regulating the grants of, and providing for the disposal of the lands of the US, South of the Tennessee, approved the 3° of March 1803° and to the laws providing for the sale of the lands of the US. generally, all of which
<pb#25/>
will be forwarded to you together with a volume of the Land laws.-
The Attorney General having had occasion, in consequence of charges brought against Gen' Rector, to take a review of the laws relative to the duties of Surveyors, and the opinions in that review the being deemed by the President to be correct, I enclose extracts therefrom, marked A. which are to be taken and deemed as part of your instructions.”
I also enclose for your information several other papers marked B. C. D. E. F. and G.”
B. Is an extract from a letter from M* Gallatin to Mº Briggs"
relative to the manner of numbering the sections in those Township plats which contain private surveys; I accompany it by a diagram which renders any further explanation unnecessary.
C. That marked C contains the forms for rendering y' accounts,”
these must be rendered to the Treasury quarter yearly, closed to the last days of March, June, September, and December. In these accounts all the monies advanced to you from the Treasury, will be credited. The debits will consist of charges for services performed by the Deputy Surveyors, pursuant to contracts to be made with you, and for Incidental expenses, which will be limited to Books and stationary for your Office. Your Salary accounts will be rendered separately and the amount will be transmitted by the Treasury in such manner as you may direct.
If monies are advanced on account which should not be done without an absolute necessity, a list thereof is to be transmitted, and the amount is to be stated as a component part of the balance to be accounted for by you in a subsequent settlement.
Your accounts are settled by the 1* Auditor of the Treasury, but they must be transmitted thro' this Office, and cannot be taken up for settlement by the Auditor, unless they are accompanied by a Certificate from this Office that the lines charged for have been run. The paper marked D. is a Copy of a letter to the Surveyors from this Office in relation to this point.
The paper marked E. is the form of a contract with the Deputy Surveyors; * on the subject of these Contracts I refer you to the review of the laws taken by the Attorney General and alluded to
<pb#26/>
above, and I have to request that copies of all contracts entered into by you be regularly returned to this office.
In entering into these Contracts you will exercise a sound discretion, having due regard to the local situation and facilities or difficulties of Surveying the lands within the limits of each Contract.
The maximum price allowed by law is four dollars a mile, but it is expected that the open piney or prairie Lands can be surveyed for less, and that it will not be necessary for you to give the maximum price in any instance, particularly as the Deputy Surveyors will not be required as heretofore to make out the plats & calculations. Where from the nature of the Country, peculiar difficulties & impediments, arrest the progress of the Deputy Surveyor he should be renumerated by including in his contract other Townships where such impediments do not exist. Where there are extensive bodies of pine woods and prairies unfit for cultivation, or unsaleable, none other than the township lines should be run.
Plats of each Township are to be neatly and accurately protracted according to law, on durable paper, by a scale of two inches to a mile, which together with the field notes, are to be recorded in Books to be kept in your office. Copies of the plats and field notes are to be transmitted to this Office. They are to made out on good paper of uniform size, and with such margin as will admit of being bound in durable books.-
The paper marked F. is a copy of the instruction of the Secretary of the Treasury, relative to the division of Fractional Sections *
To aid you in drawing up the necessary instructions to your Deputy Surveyors, I enclose the paper marked G. "
The President of the US. having decided that your office shall be located at the place selected for the Seat of Government for the Territory of Florida, you will repair to that place with all convenient dispatch and enter upon the duties of your office.
Had the northern boundary line of Florida been a parrellel of latitude in its whole extent, it would have been better to have made that your principal basis parellel, and numbered all the Townships South from that line, but as it is not, and as the lands required to be first surveyed lye in the Neighborhood of the Seat of Government and as it will be desireable in many points of view to have the Ranges and Townships numbered from the Seat of Government you will cause the South East corner of the section which may be selected by the Governor under the is Instructions relative to the division of fractional sections pursuant to the act of Apr. 24, 1820 (3 STAT. 566–567) are printed, Gen. Pub Acts . . . Instra.
. . and Opinions Attys. Geml. (Washington, 1838), II, 820–826.
1° Not recorded in letter book.
<pb#27/>
provision of the act of 4* May 1824, for the site of the permanent Seat of Government to be fixed as the point from which the principal meridian & principal parrelel shall be run, & it would be very desireable that the latitude and longitude of this point should be accurately established.—From the point thus fixed upon you will cause a Meridian line to be run due North to the Northern boundary of the Territory and due South to the Gulph of Mexico, and a parellel of latitude to be run due East to the Atlantic Ocean which it will strike north of the mouth of St John's river and due West to the river Perdido; as this line should be run with very great accuracy and as it will be a very long one you should employ for that purpose one of your most skilful Surveyors—the Ranges will be numbered East & West from the Principal Meridian and the Townships North and South from the Basis parellel—
It is very desireable that you should have prepared in due time, twenty Townships immediately contiguous to the Seat of Gov'—so that they could be proclaimed for Sale next winter or early in the ensuing Spring. This quantity of land can no doubt be surveyed without including any private claims, as Governor Duval has stated in a letter addressed to the President that there are no private claims in that section of the Country with the exception of a large grant claimed by Forbes, through this grant the Township lines may be run, but no township within which any private claims may lye, can be subdivided into Sections until after the Commissioners shall have made their report to Congress.
So soon as your Bond shall have been received and approved, a remittance will be made to you by the Treasury of Seven thousand dollars, to enable you to carry into effect these instructions.”
I have the honor to be, With great respect Your Obed" Sev"

<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY W* P. DUVAL. Pensacola Florida SIR, I have the honor to enclose you the copy of “an act providing for a grant of land for the seat of Government in the Territory of Florida, and for other purposes” ” and also the copy of “an Act granting to the Parishes or Counties of each State & Territory of the US, in which the public lands are situated, the right of preemption to quarter sections of land for Seats of Justice within the same.” ”
Under the provisions of the 4th section of the Act first mentioned Col” Robert Butler of Tennessee has been appointed surveyor for Florida,” and he has been instructed to repair with all convenient dispatch to the point selected for the seat of Govern" for that Territory, and to establish and open his Office at that place.”
The point selected for the seat of Government will be selected for the bases of all the surveying operations in Florida, and the ranges and townships, numbered from that point, this will enable every proprietor to ascertain with precision his relative situation in relation to the Seat of Government. The object of the immediate appointment of a Surveyor, is to have the Lands, in Gadsden C* surveyed into Townships, and such of the Townships subdivided as may not contain private claims, and I expect that at least twenty townships will be prepared and proclaimed for Sale as soon after the meeting of Congress as the Land Officers for Florida can be organized.
Nothing can be done in relation to the surveying of the Private claims until Congress shall legislate upon that subject”

<docbody>DEAR SIR. In consequence of indisposition I have been absent on a recruiting visit to Orange Springs and had not until yesterday the pleasure to know that I was indebted for your letter of the 3"
<pb#30/>
ins” ” The silence of M* Blair corresponds with my expectation and I am confident it will be found to be the mere precursor for an apology, that the pretended original has been lost or mislaid.
I have been informed by M. Graham that my letter in reference to the public records* has been forwarded to Governor Duval, a measure I assure you, that will not be justified by the result. The suggestions contained in my letter ought not to have been made public and by the removal of the keeper of the Public Archives the security of the official correspondence and the royal orders is not embrased.
In relation to Governor Duval as the officer to carry into effect the resolution of the House of Representatives I frankly decline. I consider it at least unfortunate—I have been informed by Moses E. Levy, Charles Gobert and Fernando Arredondo that Wm P Duval while Judge of the United States District Court was to receive from Arredondo a compensation in lands for services to be rendered by him in obtaining the confermation of a grant to Arredondo of 10 Miles square. Had I remained in the Commission it was my intention, when this Grant came under consideration, to have investigated this matter thoroughly—Levy, Gobert and Arredondo are all interested.—I have but little doubt that Duval will appoint Mº Lancaster brother in law to Mº Blair but should he appoint William Simmons, an event not improbable the emergency of the case will not be met.
The purity of M* Simmons character his intelligence and patriotic feelings qualify him in my estimation most peculiarly for a trust of delicate confidence, while an inactivity of disposition renders him less fit for a situation of constant attention—as M. Gibson does not entertain the most exalted opinion of his Excellency it is not probable that he will be selected—I am satisfied, the doubts of Mº Monroe relative to his power to interfer under the resolution of the House of Representatives would have yielded to a full examination of all the acts of Congress with reference to Florida. There is no act of Congress in force approving of the proceedings of the Legislative Council. The act of
1822 continued in force those proceedings until the expiration of the succeeding Council, since which there has been no confirmation and as the organic law of that Territory forbid any legislation on the public property and as the records were the exclusive property of the United States no act operating upon those document can be valid without an express sanction and I humbly apprehend if Congress had known that an Act of the Leg. Council authorized the Keeper of the P. Archives to place on record, under the approbation of the District
<pb#31/>
Attorney, any grants that may be produced a very different course would have been pursued. The papers placeed in the possession of Reynolds, Alvarez, and Caveda by an order from your department, are not embrased by the statutes of the Leg. Council and are not so held by those gentlemen. It is to these papers that the Congress must look for an explanation of the powers to dispose of the lands in Florida and which will probably be resorted to terminate the difficulties that embarrass large claims in other parts of the United States—
I write this letter in the confidence that it will treated private as I have no wish to impute unworthy motives to Governor Duval. To effect the object of the resolution, it is proper that Mr Monroe should be acquainted with the existance of facts *—
I am with much esteem Your Ob Sevt ALEXANDER HAMILTON

I did not receive your letter of the 3° of May last,” in time, to have furnished you with an Estimate of the Cost, which is likely to attend the execution of the Treaty with the Florida Indians, The Sum of Sixty five thousand Seven hundred Dollars, is not Sufficient to furnish

If the most exact Economy will prevent it—and as far as practicable I will Superintend in person all the important matters in relation to the Contracts, takeing care to draw them all myself, The Sum of Six thousand Dollars for Instruments of Husbandry, Stock of Cattle & Hogs, five thousand Dollars the Annuity, Two Thousand Dollars for the Transportation of the Indians to the lands assigned them, should as early as possible be deposited in the Bank of the United States at New Orleans—The Thousand Dollars for the Necessary tools and Materials and the hire of a Gun Smith, should be at the same time deposited with the Sums before Specified, I am decidley of Opinion that the $1.000 will not be more than sufficient to build a Shop, purchase the Tools, and Materials for the first Year, I have already Ordered the Tools & Materials to be brought from the North I have been under the Necessity of procureing $500
in Silver from Mi Nisbett to pay the Cheif Neamathala—and shall draw on you in Favor of M" Nisbett for One thousand Dollars as he will furnish me with many Articles that the Indians Department require—The Cheif Neamathala, as I wrote to you from Pensacola Refused to go on to Washington. The Agent had left this place for Tampa Bay before my Arrival—I wrote to him at Tampa Bay—not to proceed with the Deputation of Chiefs to Washington, as the Principal Men refused to go, but he did not receive my Letter As Colonel Humphreys knew however my object was to send Neamathala &
<pb#34/>
John Hicks. neither of whom would go—I trust he will not take on my other Cheifs—I have been some what embarrassed for want of Funds.
I directed the Agent to pay Neathamala the $500 he was entituled to receive under the Treaty this he Omitted, for what reason I am not informed as I understood from him he had been furnished with funds from your Department, none of which has ever passed through my hands—The Agent has not for a considerable time submitted any of his accounts to me but he Shall be instructed, to place every Item of disbursement under its appropriate head, I shall appoint a disinterested and Suitable person to ascertain the Value of the improvements that may be abandoned by the Indians & he will be furnished with the Necessary Instructions according to your Letter *—
I send you on my Estimates, of the probable expence of Rations for the Indians for One Year—they must be furnished at two Points Tampa bay and at some point near lake George on S' Johns River, at this place some Rations must be furnished at least at present and untill the Indians are moved from this Quarter—
Last night a Company of 4* Inf under the Command of Cap' Lear *
arrived here, The Temper of the Indians in this Quarter demand the presence of some troops, and I now assure you that unless a Respectable Military force is sent to this Quarter by the 1* of October that the Indians will not move, They are now as busy in clearing land and building their habitations as if they were never to remove—Neathamala is assuming and insolent, he has threatened to drive of the White Setlers, I must take some decided step with this Cheif—he is the only turbulent Man in the Nation—he is creating daily more and more dissatisfaction among the Indians he has avoided me since my Arrival here, although he was to meet me on a Day appointed, which he promised, but failed to do—I have understood from Cap' Lear that he has recceived Orders not to move out of Sº Marks, or to send any Detachment Out under any pretence—I consider these Orders may prove very injurious to the public Service for surely as I am on the Spot something should be left to my discretion and Judgement. The Troops should act under my Orders—or they are worse than useless at this Point, what ever Step I take will be such as the soundest dresscretion and Coolest and most Mature reflection would require, but if a Single Cheif should be factious or should in a Fit of rage or Drunkeness do mischeif I should Certainly like to send a Detachment and immeadiately & Arrest him—as to using any improper severity that shall not be permitted, If a Cheif deserves punishment I will call the other Cheifs to try him—I regret that no Sub Agent has yet been appointed, * See post, p. 63.

(private) PENSACOLA July 21* '24
SIR, In the course of our official examinations of land claims in this District, I detected an extensive scheme to defraud the Government out of a large quanty of land, and lots, situated at the most eligible points for military & naval purposes in West Florida. Having been a practising lawyer in this place previously to my appointment to the office of Commissioner,” and from a knowledge of the people and their language, I was enabled to trace out this attempted imposition through all its sinuosities and finally succeeded in procuring some original papers which incontestibly prove the titles to have been fabricated in 1820 & 1821. The number engaged in it I regret to say, were numerous and heretofore respectable, of whom the present Mayor of the city was the Chief personage. The detection of these individuals has produced in them & their adherents considerable excitement, and the odium is placed on me, as they are under the impression that had it not been for my exertions it might have passed undiscovered; Forgery was endeavored to be supported by Perjury but finding that did not succeed they have even menaced me with personal violence—I understand that some Americans here unprincipled as they are and perhaps interested in the fraud, have advised them to send forth, some petition to the President against me calculated to make an unfavorable impression, if it has no other effect.
I have no hesitation in saying that individuals can be suborned here to prove any thing that the malice of an abandoned calumniator could invent. I have the satisfaction to know that I possess the
<pb#36/>
confidence of the honest part of the whole community Spanish &
American;
I have to request that should any thing of this nature be forwarded to your office or to the President, that you will cause me to be informed of it as early as practicable, that I may protect my character against the assaults of seditious malcontents, who are disposed to lawless violence and unprincipled detraction; I have not heard the shadow of an imputation against my private or official conduct, but I should not be astonished to see myself charged with all the offences in the Decalogue, after the gross misrepresentations of the proceedings of Judge Brackenridge in the Washington papers; Those publications I learn were made on the authority of Young Scott, who is equally inimical to me, and who sets out in a few days to Washington, to open a Pandora's box of evils for the inspection of the government, this young man was bound over for an attempt at assasination; was convicted of libel.
& malicious prosecution, & is now under bonds with sureties for the peace for an assault on the Judge of the superior court, he is one of the most vicious young men I ever knew, he is vindictive and intemperate in the extreme, & not the slightest confidence can be reposed in any thing he says; I prosecuted him, in the discharge of my professional duty for some of the offences above mentioned, & he has persecuted me with the most unmitiagable rancour ever since; I consider it due to myself to inform you of the motive for any representations he may make; There may be some disclosure in the Treasury Department shortly that will place his character & that of his father in its proper light.”
I have the honor to be with high considerations of respect yr obt.

<place-time>PENSACOLA, July 26* 1824.—</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to report my return to this place last evening. Previous to leaving the detachment I had fully examined and designated the route for the Road, leaving its completion to Lieut.
Phillips * of the 4th Infy, who is an efficient officer. When I left, (the
21* Inst;) the Road was advanced to within thirty two miles of the
<pb#38/>
point where it will intersect the “Federal Road.” I was not deceived in the Country through which the road passes, & the expense will be less than my Estimate. It is in general a high, dry, ridgeway & will not only be a practicable road, but a good one, for loaded Wagons &
pleasure carriages to travel on at any season of the year. It is opened wide enough for one carriage to travel along with room to turn out when meeting another; and in a thinly settled, open-woods, country is better than if openened wider because the bushes will not grow up in it. If the Road to St. Augustine is opened only fifteen feet wide, it will not require more than one fourth of the labor & expense to complete, & will be of as much utility as if cut twenty five feet as comtemplated by the law.—
Capt: Clark “Ass. Q M* at Tampa Bay has required from me a Surveyor's Compass & chain; & also pack saddles & packing bags. I
can furnish him those I had with me as I do not expect to need them again. He states too that he believes he cannot purchase Indian ponies for packing & that the five mules he now has cannot be spared from the service of the Cantonment. In that case he expects me to furnish him with mules as well as funds to enable him to commence by the first of October next. To meet this call, I have to request you will be pleased to add $1700 to my estimate for the third Quarter of the Current year.—
I enclose my receipt for $4000. I shall procure the funds on it from New Orleans forthwith & then render my last Quarter's accounts. for settlement. My absence from Pensacola at this time will not interfere with other duties, as I conceive I have done all that is necessary in regard to the Road, until the detachment shall have returned near to this place.—
My Clerk informs me that several public letters, & among them four or five from you, had arrived during my last absence, all of which, excepting those from the Treasury, were sent on to me by a private conveyance; they however missed me on my way down, & their receipt will be delayed some time as I shall be compelled to send up the country after them, there being no Post Office in that Section.”—

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, July 29. 1824</place-time>
<docbody>By the 9. article of the Treaty of the 18 Sept. 1823" with the Florida Indians it was stipulated, “that should the country embraced within the limits described in the 2" article of said treaty, upon examination of the Indian agent and the Commissioner or Commissioners to be appointed under the 8, art. of said Treaty, be by them considered insufficient for the support of the said Indians, then the North line as defined by the aforesaid 2* article of the said treaty, shall be removed so far North as to embrace a sufficient quantity of good tillable land. In pursuance of this stipulation, Col” Gadsden, the Commissioner appointed to make the survey, was instructed “if, In making the survey he should find that the Northern line as defined in the Treaty does not embrace a sufficiency of good land for the accommodation of the Indians to exercise a sound discretion and remove it further North so as to include the necessary quantity,” ”—
The Commissioner has accordingly recommended that the North line be extended, as laid down on the annexed map, and as the boundary from its Eastern extremity, suggests the propriety of adopting the Ocklewaha river to its source, and from thence in a direction so as to close with the Eastern line agreed on in the Treaty.”
The Secretary of War has therefore the honor to submit the proposed extension of the Northern and modification of the Eastern line, as described in the annexed map, for the approbation of the President of the United States.**

<docbody>HoNº JoHN C. CALHOUN Secretary of War SIR I have had some difficulty with the Indians in this quarter, They did not make an attack on our citizens, but they were extremely insolent and made many threats, Their cheifs had in some instances killed our cattle and hogs—they also had gone with their men to several of our settlers and ordered them off, they threatened to drive the people out of the country and to make war on me In short the whole of their conduct was such, that I saw immediate hostilities must ensue if they did not receive a timely check. The military sent to this post not being under my command as I think they should have been, were of no use, to me in stopping, the indians in their course.” I determined at once to call out the few men that reside in this quarter, They came as volunteers to the New Seat of Goverment well armed In the meantime, I called be the cheifs and warriors of the Appalachicola to meet me at Judge Robinsons, about 30 miles from their Towns—They all promptly attended—and were ready to act as I might order. This sudden movement so surprised the Tallahassee and Meckkeesuckee Indians, that they hurried to meet me and promised to obey my Orders and to respect my authority The chiefs were greatly allarmed, and I think they will, be more circumspect in future—but I have but little confidence in them, The next day I took the Interpreter with me and went to Neamathelas Town. I found their about 300 warriors and I saw many of them armed—I immediately went into their square yard—(which is their foram) and gave them a talk, and ordered them all to meet me on the 26 Int at St. Marks, & assured them that their ruin and distruction was cirtain unless they obeyed my orders—On the day appointed about 600 Indians attended at this place and I dilivered to them a talk that made considerable impression on them, I then appointed John Hicks their head chief to lead them south to their land, and I selected the eldest son of King Hijah, as his chief councellor, these appointments the warriors confermed, These chiefs are men of sense and will execute my orders—I hope now no further difficulty will shorty occur with these people—I will take the
<pb#41/>
liberty to say that a braver and better officer of his grade is not to be found in the 4 Regt. of Infty, than Capt Lear commanding this post I flatter myself that the Goverment will recollect the value and the services of this officer, whenever an Occasion may be presented—
I have directed the Indians to prepare to move, and to be on their land by the 1st day of October next, at which time they will receive their rations The want of funds have impeded my operations but from your last letter " I trust soon to be relieved from that difficulty, I cannot omit to impress on you the importance of having a respectable force in this quarter by the 15" of September next,” The indians are restless and much dissatisfyd with the treaty, if the big swamp near the North line was given up to them it would completely satisfy them. The chiefs insist that they have sent men to examine the country and that their report is, the good lands within their present boundary is insufficent—this is in fact the only obsticle on the part of the Indians—and as their are spanish grants (newly made I have no doubt) that cover this swamp—perhaps it would be best to let them have it—
I can now venture to say that the expence of carrying the treaty into effect will not exceed my estimate transmitted to you and I hope to make it even less, I have not heard a word from the Agent since May last, or about the first of June * The whole trouble of attending to the indians in this quarter & of issuing their rations has been performed by me The agent is no doubt engaged in discharging his duties about Tampa Bay—but I have been induced to mention this from the necessity of his absence—that; I have been put to great trouble fatigue and expence in riding over this country in order to regulate the indians, and to make contracts for the goverment, which are highly advantageous, and will save some thousands of Dollars I hope that some just compensation will be allowed me, as well as for the sums I shall have to disburse I will repeat to you that it is important for the publick interests, that the subagent should report to me as early as possible He will have to repair either to St. Johns River or to Tampa Bay to attend to the rations to be issued to the Indians”

<docbody>SIR, Not long before the Term of the last Superior Court, I received information from Washington, that my accounts as the Marshall of this District, for Territorial expenses would not be allowed, by the Comptroller of the Treasury—M* Steele the District Attorney notwithstanding this information, moved a rule against me to shew cause why an attachment should not issue for not paying the Petit Jurors of the Territory—My answer to this illegal and extraordinary motion was filed, stating these facts, upon which the Court discharged the rule—M* Steele in the presence of a number of Individuals, who had been previously inflamed by representations of the injustice done them, by my refusal to pay them money to which they were not entitled, and which I was forbidden to pay by the Accounting Officer to whom I was responsible, publicly harrangued them, and among other things informed them that I intended to keep the money for speculation, and that “the Judge was a damned Scoundrel” for not sustaining the rule against me and such has been the impression made upon the minds of the people, that I shall find great difficulty in procuring a Jury at the next Term of the Court, and be otherwise embarrassed in the discharge of my official duties—M' Steele has lately become the intimate friend of M* Scott, who is the Author of the vulgar letters you may have seen in the Eastern Papers against the Judge and myself, which I corrected by the enclosed publicacations,” for which I received a challenge from Mº Scott, who could only be noticed as a Blackguard, and violater of the law; having been convicted of Libel, Malicious Prosecution, and an attempt at assasination; and being a common disturber of the Peace, I paid no attention to the challenge—the next day I found myself posted by an outrageous Libel in which the name of my relation Col. Johnson of Kentucky was gratuitously and thjustly unjustifiably introduced—For these offences; I had Mº Scott brought before an examining Court at which M Steele is in the habit of attending; and even threatening the Justices with punishment for not committing Individuals against
<pb#43/>
whom he has conceived hostility—He did not attend upon a pretext of indisposition, which was entirely pretended, as he was out all day after the Trial, and uncommonly boisterous at dinner—The Libel against me was in the hand writing of an intemperate young man,”
who lives with M* Steele, and whom he calls his Clerk, and was sent forth from his Office, and I have no doubt he was the Author—when the original Libel on which Mº Scott was convicted, was produced in Court, from the Printing Office it was found to be in Mº Steele's hand writing—It will readily occur to you, that it will be impracticable to punish such gross offences, when the prosecuting Attorney, himself if not the Author, is at least the abetter to them, and under such circumstances there is no hope of conviction—M* Steele has been supported here, for the facility, with which he could write lampoons on the Judge, the Commissioners, and every other Officer, who was in the fearless, and faithful discharge of his duties; and in proportion as his improprieties sunk him, the greater efforts were made to sustain him. He has lately been suspended from the Bar, for gross and dishonest practices in his profession, and a series of the most outrageous oppression and abuses in office—
He is now in the Prison Bounds, for his Tailors Bill, and there are Judgments unsatisfied against him, for upward of One Thousand Dollars, Money collected for his Clients and embezzled by him—
I have felt it my duty to lay these facts before the government, and request that you will submit them to the inspection of the President of the United States *—

<place-time>[August 1, 1824]</place-time>
<docbody>Copy of the submission to, and Opinion of the Honble H. M.
Brackenridge, Judge of the Superior and District Courts of West Florida, upon a question submitted to him by the commissioners for ascertaining claims and titles of Lands in the District of West Florida and their Secretary, upon the construction of the Act of Congress of the last Session, approved the 28* February 1824 *
Submission The Commissioners vs. M. Hunter, Secretary An agreed case The commissioners claims of the Secretary such fees as he is bound under an Act entitled “An Act to extend the time limited for the settle-
<pb#45/>
ment of private land claims in the Territory of Florida” to pay over to them. It is agreed that the Secretary has received from the Treasury of the United States the sum of $1250 under the 2° Section of the Act of Congress May 8* 1822.” It is admitted that he has received fees for recording Grants concessions &ca from the claimants under the 4* section of the same law to a small amount far short of
$1250 at 10 cents for each hundred words for recording “said papers.”
As some doubts have arisen as to the construction of this law, it is agreed to submit it, to the Superior Court of West Florida to be judicially and constitutionally expounded. The Commissioners are not to be considered as giving an Opinion that the Secretary is bound to refund the fees by this submission.—Pensacola 25* June 1824.
Opinion The Commissioners for settling Land Claims in West Florida vs M. Hunter, Secretary of the Board This is an agreed case referred by the parties to the decision of the Superior Court on the construction of the 5* Section of the Act of Congress of February 28* 1824 and the 4* Section of the Act of 7th May 1822.*
The first act in the section referred to, provides that the former Secretaries, or those who may now be Secretaries, to the Board of Commissioners, who shall have received their salary of One Thousand two hundred and fifty dollars, from the Treasury of the United States, which is by law declared to be, their full compensation shall be and they are hereby required to pay over respectively to the commissioners conformably with the provisions of the original law, all such fees as have been demanded and received by them, which shall be appropriated to defray the expenses of the Commission.”
The original law thus referred to, is the Act of 7” May 1822 before mentioned. The only question which presents itself is whether according to the fair construction of that law the Secretary was entitled to the ten Cents for recording Title papers, mentioned in the
4* section, over and above the sum of $1250 as a Salary from the Treasury? for it does not appear that any other fees have been received by the Secretary under that law.
The construction of Statutes is not left to the arbitrary will, or caprice of the Judge, but the law has laid down fixed and established rules for his guide. But it is the peculiar province of the Judiciary
<pb#46/>
to interpret Laws, “6 Bac 478, and it is recognised as a sound principle in the Courts of the United States, that the Legislature cannot pass an Act declaring what the law is, but only what is shall be, that such an Act as a declaratory one would not be binding on the Courts, 2 Cranch 272. In that case, the Court would not even hear an argument. The declaration of the Act, that Twelve hundred and fifty dollars, is by law the full compensation, can only be considered as intended to operate in future and not as declaratory of the meaning of the present law, and if it did so could not be regarded. But it may be said, that unless the Act of '24 be intended to compel the Secretary to pay over the fees for recording, received by him under the 4* section of the Act of '22 it was a superflous and useless legislation. This may be true and is so in the present instance. If the Secretary was authorized by the Act of Congress to receive fees for certain services rendered, he could not be deprived of them if the services were rendered, any more than he could be deprived of any part of his property without compensation. Such an Act would be a monster in legislation: & we have already seen that no legislative construction of law will bind the Judiciary The law as to what is passed, can have no operations upon acts done under the first Act, even if we leave out of view the expressions comformable, with the provisions of the original law. If under the law the Commissioners had a right to demand the fees of the Secretary there was no necessity for a second law to enable them to do so. Does the first law authorises the commissioners to demand the fees or any part thereof for recording &c received by the Secretary when the amount does not exceed twelve hundred and fifty dollars?
By the 2" section of the Act ’22 the Commissioners are required to appoint a well qualified Secretary, who is to record their acts and proceedings, the claims rejected, and those admitted, with the reasons and is to receive for his services One thousand two hundred & fifty dollars to be paid quarterly from the Treasury. The duties assigned by this section are those which have usually been assigned to the Secretary of similar Boards, where the Office of Secretary was distinct from that of recorder, and the compensation considerably less then has been heretofore allowed for similar services. It is moreover not made to depend on any contigencies, but is absolutely & positively fixed to be paid from the Treasury, & this being the case as general expressions in a subsequent part of the Act can be construed to effect or impart the right conferred by this section if a particular thing be given or limited in the prepart of a Statute, this shall not be taken away or altered by any subsequent general words of the same statute
“6” Bac 481.
<pb#47/>
The fourth section of the Act provides for the recording of Grants Patents, Concessions, Orders of Survey, & instead of creating an Office for the purpose as have been usual on former occasions, annexed this duty to the office of Secretary allowing him to receive from the claimants ten cents for every hundred words the lowest compensation hitherto allowed for this service. As this was evidently for the benefit of the claimants (for there never was any record in this or any other territory of such papers the Act of '24 as well as that of '22 & every former Act of Congress establishing Boards of Commissioners provides that the claimants shall pay for this service. And considering that the whole expense does not exceed a dollar or two for thus having their titles preserved in a record Book, which will remain among them, there is nothing more just and reasonable then that they should be subjected to it. That they should be required to record their title papers for the information of every one is in conformity with the policy pursued in in numerous other cases. This subjects the claimants to no other expense but this which is for his own benefit, and one which no prudent man would not incur; whatever they may pay to Agents or Attornies to prepare their claims is entirely voluntary of their part. That this cause is intended to provide for cases of a distinct nature & a distinct compensation from those of the second section, is self evident, on the simplest rules of grammatical construction. After making it the duty of the claimants to file their papers we find these words “which shall be recorded by the Secretary, and who for his said services shall be entitled to demand from the claimants ten cents for each hundred words contained in said papers so recorded he shall be entitled to receive, twenty five cents for each sub-poena issued,” Then follows the proviso which shall be noticed presently. It is very clear that nothing in this section thus far has any relation to what is contained in the second section. The services to be performed are of a different kind to be paid in a different way.
For recording the Acts of the Board, their opinion of different claims, for translating such papers as they may require to be translated, the claimants are not required to pay anything & there could be no way of estimating those services by the hundred words The proviso which follows is clearly confined to the matters contained in this section, provided that if the amount so received shall exceed One Thousand two hundred &fifty Dollars, which is hereby declared the compensation for his services, the excess shall be reported to the Commissioners and shall be subject to their disposition.” If after the word his in the last line, the word said have been introduced, or a different sum from that in the second section had been mentioned, there would not have been a “loop to hang a doubt upon” but as it is a doubt can only exist in the
<pb#48/>
mind of the most shallow sciolist of the law. The first part of this proviso evidently refers to the matters which immediately proceed, and the subsequent part is in gramatical order insaparably connected with that number of the sentence. But the subject is susceptible of still clearer demonstration of the soundest principles of law.
We have already seen that a thing which has been given by a previous part of the statute cannot be taken away by general words in a subsequent parts it is also a rule that if the “literal expressions of the law would lead to absurd, unjust or inconvenient consequences, such construction should be given as to avoid such consequences, if from the whole purview and giving effect to words used, it may be fairly done.”
If then the Proviso refers to the second section as well as to the matter contained in the fourth, and that instead of two sums of $1250 there is but one identical sum contemplated by both sections it will follow that two ways are provided for the payment of it, to the Secretary, first out of the Treasury of the United States, and next by fees to be received from the claimants. What would be the partical operation? the Secretary draws his salary quarterly from the Treasury, is not made to depend on any contigency, he is paid at the end of each quarter, without any inquiery about his fees, and in the meantime may have received a like amount in fees. What becomes of the amount received in the way last mentioned? He is only to account to the commissioners for the excess, and if no excess the law does not require him to account for it any where. The word excess cannot by the most forced construction be made to apply to any thing but the fees received. The expression “which is hereby declared the compensation for his services” are to be read as a parenthesis, the sence then will be “that if the amount so received &"—
shall exceed $1250 the excess shall be reported to the commissioners.
Can this mean the excess of the $1250 to be paid from the Treasury?
If any reference had been intended it would have been provided that the Secretary should account for all the fees received. Where the necessity of reporting the excess? The Secretary might be required to report the fees received by him, his salary being fixed any thing received beyond that sum must have been excess Was it intended to give him the option of being paid directly from the Treasury or to depend on the contigency of fees? The idia is too absurd. If the sum to be paid from the Treasury had been less than $1250 there might be reason to contend that the allowance of fees was intended to make up that sum as a full compensation, although such would not be a sound construction even in that case without falling into evident absurdity and inconvenience. Can any other construction be given to the 2" and 4" sections of the Act of “22" then it was intended to
<pb#49/>
allow two distinct sums of $1250 each to be paid in a different manner for services of a different nature?
When we examine the Acts of Congress in pari materia and consider whether the compensation allowed to this construction be reasonable or otherwise, the intention of the Legislature will be still more clearly manifested. There have been many boards of Commissioners in the different territories established for the same purpose as that of West Florida under circumstances precisely similar. Let us see what has been the compensation allowed for like services. It may first be proper to remark that in every instance during twenty years legislature on the same subject, the claimants have been required to pay for recording their papers, and in every instance more than in West Florida. In the land District of Vincennes, Kaskaskia, and Detroit the claimants were required to pay to the Register of the land Office
12% Cents for each hundred words for recording their titles, and in addition to this he received his regular salary from the Treasury of the United States and both in conjunction formed his compensation in all the Boards organised subsequent to the foregoing the same provisions were made for the recording officer, of payments from both the Treasury and the claimants. By the Acts of Congress of the 2"
March 1805° establishing boards in the Territories of Louisiana and Orleans a Register was appointed a salary of Fifteen Hundred dollars and fees for recording to be paid by the claimants at the rate of 12%
cents for every hundred words. The whole amount thus received for fees went to the Register instead of being limited to any particular sum. There was moreover a Clerk to the Board who received a stated salary to be paid our of the Treasury of two Thousand dollars and whose duties were similar to those of the Secretary of this Board. A
translator was also allowed, with a salary of six hundred dollars &
fees which duty is also imposed upon the secretaries of the commissioners in Florida without any additional compensation. Here are upwards of Four thousand dollars paid out of the Treasury for services, for which in Florida only Twelve hundred and fifty dollars are allowed, and besides in the former cases, the sum which might be received for fees was not limited to any particular amount This compensation was continued with very little variation in amount until the Commission closed in 1809. By the Act 25* April 1812 ” two commissioners were appointed to adjust the land claim in two Districts of Louisiana East and West of Pearl River who were allowed a salary of
$1500 each, and were required to hold their offices at different places they were allowed each a Clerk who received One Thousand dollars
<pb#50/>
from the Treasury and was permitted to demand fees for recording at the rate of 12% cents for every hundred words without any limitation. For each of these boards therefore the sum of Two thousand dollars was allowed for the Services of Clerks besides fees. In the District East of Pearl River or Jackson court House by an Act passed
3 march 1819 7" the Register was allowed two thousand dollars a year ex-officio commissioner and a Clerk was appointed with a salary of twelve hundred dollars from the Treasury and besides 12% cents from the claimants as his compensation for recording the papers of the claimants, without being limited to any particular amount.” By an Act of Congress passed at the present session relating to the adjustment of Land titles at St Helena and Jackson Court House, the Register and Receiver is allowed a salary of One Thousand Dollars from the Treasury and a Clerk who shall be a person capable of Translating the French and Spanish Language is allowed twelve hundred and fifty dollars.” It thus appear that the compensation allowed to the Secretary of the Board in Florida, even according to the construction which has been put on the same is lower then has ever been hitherto allowed for similar services. According to a different construction the compensation would be manifestly in adequate. The most laborious part of his duty that of recording the land titles must be continued without interruption while he is attending on the board, and the fees being very low, they are scarcely sufficient to pay an assistant whose services are indispensable. The whole amount received for recording fall far short of the sum of twelve hundred and fifty dollars. The duty of Recorder and Translator were assigned to the Secretary evidently for the sake of creating fewer Officers as well as for the purpose of economy, but it is equally clear that it was intended to enable the Secretary to employ assistants for whose Acts he should be responsible. In all the laws referred to, the Clerk has been allowed fees for recording, over and above his salary from the Treasury, and in every instance he was probably compelled to employ an assistant. If but one sum of $1250
be allowed in Florida, the Secretary must pay one half of it for that purpose, thus rendering his compensation entirely inadequate and out of all reason compared to what has been usually allowed as well as from the nature of the Service performed. According to the law last referred to, the Clerk is allowed the same sum which is allowed in the second section of the Act under consideration but he is allowed nothing more, for the very obvious reason that there was nothing but the Acts
<pb#51/>
of the Register, to record the title papers Grants &c having been already filed and recorded. The duties were precisely similar to those assigned to the Secretary under the the second section just mentioned.
Upon the whole I am clearly of Opinion that the Commissioners are only entitled to an account of the fees received by the Secretary under the 4* Section when the amount exceeds $1250 and that any sum under that amount was intended as a compensation to the Secretary for the recording the title papers of the claimants. Any other construction would be manifestly unjust and would be entirely at variance with what has heretofore been considered a reasonable compensation by Congress for similar services. It would be to require him to discharge the accumulated duties of three Offices of Secretary, Recorder and Translator, for a less sum than has been heretofore allowed to each of them.

DEAR SIR I am under the painful necessity of announcing to you the death of the Hon” William W. Blair one of the land Commissioners of East Florida—he departed this life the 29" ultimo.
And I regret to say that from the continued illness of Judge Blair we have not been able to make that progress in the duties of the Commission as I fear the Government will expect—from the commencement of the Commission we have had little or no assistance from Colonel Hamilton, and his successor as yet, has not been here;
should he come on shortly, or a successor be appointed to fill Judge Blairs vacancy, I yet flatter myself that we will be able to adjudicate on and report all the cases which can possibly be prepared by our Secretary in the time alloted us—And I am sorry that the immense duty of translating voluminous documents, recording them, and after all copying them in the form of a report seems not to have been properly considered by the framers of the Law—We are by the late Law authorized to act on Office abstracts; this is not so great a facility as it may have been considered—the best translators inform us, that there is little difference in making copies, and correct abstracts—
We would feel grateful for any instructions which either of the departments of Government might conceive useful to the correct de-
<pb#52/>

<place-time>NEAR NASHVILLE August 5* 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to address you on the subjects suggested in my last 7°–
It appears from my instructions, that it is expected I will not in any instance allow the Deputies the maximum p" Mile, owing to the duties of Platting & calculating, having been transfered to my office: and in making contracts I am to exercise a sound discretion having regard to the difficulties which may present themselves in the section of Country Contracted for—During & subsequent to the Seminole Campaign, I
had an opportunity of seeing much of the country above the Cape in both the Floridas, and I have no hesitation in saying; that much greater difficulties are presented to the Surveyors in that quarter than the State of Alabama afforded, and I am informed that the Maximum has been uniformly given in that Department. The Poor Lands of Florida are generally covered with the Saw Palmetto which is destructive to Horses and difficult to the passage of Footmen, and interspersed occasionally with Bay Galls or swamps, thickly covered with the Bay and other timber.
When I consider the face of the Country generally, as well from personal Knowledge, as information derived from others, I am free to Acknowledge that the Maximum given, will insure its Survey throughout, otherwise I am persuaded that Legislative provision will have to be made extending the limit for the Survey of the rich Hammock Land on the Lakes, Bays, Inlets & water courses—
7. A report by Floyd and Blair, submitted Feb. 21, 1824, is in NA (GLO, E.
Fla. Reports, Acts of 1822 and 1823; printed, H. Exec. Doc. 156, 18 Cong., 1
sess., and A. S. P., Pub. Lands, III, 725–750). See post, p. 42.
7° Ante, p. 25.
<pb#53/>
These ideas are given you, with a hope that you will remove the restriction placed upon me as first set forth in this letter, believing as I
do, that it will be difficult to procure and retain good Surveyors for less than the Maximum in that climate—
Your Circular D. requires estimates for the present year only—You have instructed the Survey of 20 Townships; but I infer a propriety in sending you inclosed an estimate for the succeeding year to call for Appropriation—In making this estimate, it is predicated upon the fact, that the number of Surveyors which I shall employ immediately; can, after having completed the Townships already required; survey the proposed Amount by the last day of April 1825, which I deem the latest period practicable to Survey in that climate with its attendant evils—The 1* of Nov. in each year I consider the proper period of commencement; affording six months for field operations—To survey in any part of the residue, I would deem it destructive of Human &
Animal life; should you therefore determine on a larger estimate, please notify me in time, to enable me to have it executed in the period above suggested—I presume you intend, that I shall exercise my own discretion as to the particular location of the 20 Townships immediately required in the vicinity of the Seat of Government—
I have not yet received the Laws, and am desirous of perfectly understanding the office regulations growing out of them, and therefore beg leave to ask for information on the following subjects not embraced in your instructions—viz.
Office Rent, furniture, & fuel Clerks—number & salaries of.
Is payment for Printed instructions to Deputies Authorised—
I will thank you to have me furnished from your Office with a sample of the most suitable paper, with regard to size and quality, on which Townships are to be protracted—

<place-time>ST. AUGUSTINE 12 August 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>HON THE SECRETARY OF STATE, I regret the necessity I am under in troubling you so often with respect to my claim on the Department for adv. the Laws of the Territory. This service has been performed since October last;
when I transmitted my aſc in blank” but received no answer. I
wrote repeatedly after that,” and in June last I received a letter from Mr. W. Browne saying that if I would forward a pamphlet copy of the laws the money would be forwarded.” Not being able to procure a copy (the work being printed at Pensacola, and being put in the hands of a few public officers only) I therefore called on the Judge of the Superior Court who certified the no. of pages which was contained in the printed copy, and again transmitted my aſc in blank,” but have not since then received any information from it.
I regret very much, not to have been able to send on a printed copy of the laws, and hope that my inability to do so will be received as an excuse. I thought that the certificate would have been sufficient, but if the money is detained on this account, I beg to referr [MS.
torn] to the aſcs of Messrs. Fitzgerald & Co. of West Florida already in the Department, and which were paid in Jan or Feb. last, where the precise amount will be ascertained.”
I hope, Sir, you will pardon my importunity on subject, as the small amount due me will be of the most essential service to me, and necessary to meet a debt due my agent in Charleston since the time I first transmitted my aſc. St. Augustine is at present labouring under severe pecuniary embarrassment, from various causes, but which the people are taught by the disaffected, to attribute to the general Government, and many of the Spaniards have been thus operated upon to abandon it, and are making arrangements to move away. A republican by birth and education, I have of choice, both publicly and privately defended the administration from unjust imputations—have endeavoured, so far as my situation in life would enable me to do it, to inculcate peace and good order, and a love for the institutions of my country; and the better to do this I have kept out of view the great questions which engage the attentions of the
<pb#57/>
political parties in the U. S. To further these views we want men here in public office of upright intentions and fixed principles—men of experience and lovers of good order, and moral deportment I beg leave also to draw your attention to the situation of Land titles here. The people have been unceasing in their complaints since the organization of the Board. Many of the people look to the sale of their lands for the support of their families, being destitute of every other resource—and their complaints are also loud with respect to the absence of Mr Worthington, who, we are informed, will not be here till November. There is no possibility of disposing of lands until the Board has passed upon and adjusted the titles.
I hope, sir, that you will pardon me for these hints, being assured that you will receive them kindly. With a desire to promote the public welfare I subscribe myself Yours &c."

COLONEL By an act of Congress approved by the 28* of February last,” the President was authorized to cause a road to be surveyed and marked out from Cape Florida, the South Eastern extremity of the Peninsula of Florida, to S' Augustine—You have been appointed to perform that service—should you accept the appointment,” it is desirable that you commence your operations so soon as the season shall permit.

To DAVIS FLOYD, GEORGE MURRAY & W. H. ALLEN, Commissioners of land titles in East Florida, at St. Augustine GENTLEMEN I have the honour to enclose, herewith, two public Documents submitted to the House of Representatives of the United States at their last Session, and printed by their order.
1. A Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Chairman of the Committee on public lands,” transmitting a report from Mess’rs Floyd and Blair,” with enclosures, relating to land claims in Florida.
2. A message from the President of the United States, to the House of Representatives” transmitting a Report of Alexander Hamilton, and sundry papers relating to the same claims.”
The Report of the Committee on the public lands," to whom this message of the President, with Mr. Hamiltons Report was refered, will particularly require your attention; and you will observe, it concludes with two Resolutions which were adopted by the House,”
and by one of which the President is requested to cause to be prepared and transmitted to the Commissioners, such instructions touching their powers and the performance of their duties under the existing laws, as he may deem necessary, from an examination of the Report of Mr. Hamilton, and from that of the other two Commissioners for East Florida.
The instructions to be given under the said Resolutions will be
<pb#61/>
necessarily of a general character; and I am directed by the President of the United States to state to you his reliance that in the discharge of their duties, the Commissioners will be peculiarly cautious in guarding against the frauds which, from experience, it is to be expected will be attempted to be practiced for obtaining the confirmation of spurious, forged and unlawful grants. He is fully convinced that neither the Governors General of Cuba, nor the Governors or commanding officers in Florida, ever had or exercised an unlimited authority for granting lands; and he trusts that the Commissioners will in no case, recommend the confirmation of any claim exceeding in amount the quantity which the Governors were authorised by the general laws of the Indies, to grant *

<docbody>To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Sº Marks.
SIR, I have received your letters of the 12* Ultimo," accompanied by the expense of the Rations to be furnished to the emigrant Indians in Florida, according to the late treaty. The estimate for the rations exceeds the appropriation. But the expense on that account must by no means be permitted to exceed the sum appropriated by Congress. I am decidedly of the impression that sum will be found sufficient, as I cannot doubt from all I can learn that the estimate of the number of Indians in Florida is greatly exaggerated, and must believe that the meat and bread part of the ration will not cost 12%
cts, as you have estimated—a price exceeding the average rate of the complete ration throughout the U. States. With those im-
<pb#62/>
pressions, and the fact that children will receive but half rations, I
cannot doubt but that the sum appropriated will be found to be ample.
I have, however entire confidence in your judgment and zeal to serve the public, and that you will take such measures as to conduct the concentration of the Indians in Florida, as will be most effectual and economical.
A requisition will issue as requested by you for $13,500—(thirteen thousand five hundred dollars) that is to say Six thousand as provided for by the 3” Article of the Treaty; Five thousand as provided for by the 3” Article, 2000$ as provided for by the 5* article, and five hundred being the balance due under the 6* Article. This sum will be placed to your credit in the bank of New Orleans.
You state that you have paid to Neamalatha 500$ under the Treaty.
On enquiring of the agent I understood from him verbally, that the same amount had been expended, by his direction to purchase Cattle at the request of this Chief. I directed the agent to make a report of this case, which however, he has neglected. I fear there will be some embarrassment in the disbursement, as the appropriation provides only for five hundred dollars, and it will be impossible that both of you can receive a credit. This subject ought to be immediately attended to.
I cannot believe that the Indians can be so infatuated as to make any decided objection to the removal, and that the hostile disposition which they now shew is intended to produce some relaxation in the terms of the Treaty, but when they find the Government is resolved to carry its provisions into effect they will acquiesce without trouble, particularly as they are eminently beneficial to the Indians. It will be impossible to augment the number of Troops now in Florida, unless it should become necessary to apply force to a much greater extent than I now anticipate. The Officer commanding at Sº Marks has received instructions to consult with you and to act under your directions.
Your Drafts in favor of Col” Nesbit for one thousand dollars has been paid. The accounts and estimates of the agent will be rendered through you, and will be specifically approved by you. Puntuality in their rendition will be required. You are authorized to appoint a Sub-agent for One year at five hundred dollars per annum, payable quarter-yearly. You will report his appointment to the Department for confirmation. It is believed the services of a Sub-agent will not be required after the Indians shall have been concentrated on their reservation. The agent has rendered a statement of his account by which it appears he has advanced under your orders on a contract made by you with M* Chairs the sum of three thousand dollars.
<pb#63/>
It is proper you should be apprized that under existing laws, no advances should be made, and that neither yourself, nor the agent can obtain payment for the sum advanced 'til the Cattle are delivered under the contract, and receipted for."
I have the honor &c. &c.

under these circumstances I was not a little surprized at your unqualified declaration that the money “ought long since to have been deposited in Bank” It perhaps ought to have been there deposited by Shomo but not me, for I had it not to deposit, & had it not been for my uncommon exertions not one cent would have been saved—I was appointed to U States atto in 1822 & part of 1823 after the death of Mr Harrison 4 & before the arrival of M* Steele, & in that capacity I

letter alluded to, and from a reference to it, it will appear that it bears date between the 17* of July, & the 1* August 1823.” This subject was never again brought before the Board in my presence, until after my arrival with my family, about the first of November.
I learned that some misunderstanding had taken place, between M*
Blair, and Mº Hamilton, with regard to the propriety of carrying into effect the order from the Department of State, as it would have a tendency, to destroy a public Office, established by the Legislative Council,” & sanctioned by Congress; and furthermore, that it would have thrown into the hands, and custody of our Secretary, a mass of papers, for the examination, and arrangement of which, his whole time would have been necessary: And although under the circumstances above named, I had united in the letter which produced that order, I felt myself bound, to unite with Mº Blair in opposing the measures, so ardently pursued by M. Hamilton to procure the possession of those papers:–this matter has heretofore been laid before the proper Department, and should not now, have been again stirred, only for the purpose of accounting for the apparent inconsistancy in first writing the letter, and then opposing the execution of the order—That Mr Hamilton has been more fortunate than the other commissioners, in procuring papers, purporting to be Official correspondance, and Royal Orders, will appear from the two reports:–We obtained papers, & documents, and papers as authentic, alone from the Office of the Keeper of the public Archives; how M* Hamilton obtained those, we know not, nor do we apprehend any serious loss to the United States, should the opinion of a Majority of the Board, tho' conscientiously given, prove to be erroneous:–As to the powers invested in Gov"
Quesada,” as but few grants were made by him, and those only for small quantities of Land—I beg leave further to state, that so particular have we been in taking every probable means in our power, by directing the United States Att’ to devote most of his time, in examining the titles, comparing, and investigating the facts, so as to impeach those, which may be considered suspicious, that we have feared least the government should think that we were unnecessarily demanding services of that Officer, we would be glad to be instructed on this subject. Another subject which I cannot forbear naming;
M" Hamilton, named to me, as well as to other Gentlemen of this place, that he either had, or knew evidence which would shew a grant to F. M. Arredondo for 50.000 acres a fraudulent One. This case has

<docbody>W* HENRY ALLEN Esq Commissioner for adjusting claims to Lands in East Florida now at Baltimore SIR, In consequence of the conversation which I had the pleasure to have with you yesterday, I now enclose a memorandum of the Classification which I think it advisable that the Commissioners should adopt in making their Reports to the Secretary of the Treasury, accompanied by form marked A, which will be common to all the Reports from Nº 1 to Nº. 11 inclusive—The form marked B, will be used for the Reports from Nº. 12 to N* 14 inclusive—Where it is not necessary to fill up the Columns in the form A, or where from want of information it cannot be done, they will be left vacant—In the column left for that purpose such remarks may be made as the peculiarity of each particular claim may make necessary or proper. Each Report should be closed by such general remarks as the Commissioners may deem proper in relation to each class of claim & should be signed by them or a majority of them, Should any one of the Commissioners dissent from the majority, he may assign his reasons for so doing on the Report, or in a seperate protest—These reports should all be made on paper of the same size & in such manner as to allow of their being bound together, and the Commissioners ought to keep duplicates of them in their office. The Classification of the Reports may be extended, in any manner that the Commissioners may deem necessary, & I would recommend for the reasons stated to you personally, that a seperate report be made of all the cases recommended for confirmation

<docbody>Col ROB" BUTLER, Fountane of Health Tennessee SIR, Your letter of the 5* Ins' * is received. My instructions are explicit on the subject of Contracts for the Surveying of the Public Lands, they authorise you if necessary to give the maximum price, but intimate an opinion that the surveying may be executed for something less than the maximum price—This intimation was admonitory, & in some measure founded on a belief that it was the general practice of Surveyors General to cause the Township plats to be made out by the Deputies, I understand however from Gen' Coffee * that such has not been the practice in his office. Your estimate for the surveying to be executed in 1825, is as large a one as will be submitted to Congress. It is probable that it will be expedient to survey within that year the exterior lines of a greater number of Townships than you mention, but it will not be necessary to subdivide that number, as I presume you will not find as many Townships of good land, which are not interfered with by private claims, I see no prospect of getting any of the private claims surveyed sooner than November
1825. Office Rent, Furniture & fuel are not allowed as contingent expences, the necessary printing is allowed, & instruments &C for surveying & drawing—You will percieve from the law that there has been an omission to allow Clerk hire, and also an omission to make an appropriation for your Salary—the latter will however be paid out of the contingent appropriation for the Treasury Department.
As to the Clerk hire there can be no doubt that Congress will when they act on the subject allow to you the same amount for Clerk hire which is allowed by Law to Gen' Coffee. In the mean time you will on opening your office employ one Clerk, untill the Surveyors return their field notes when you may possibly find it necessary to employ two Clerks. You will advise this office of the names of the person or persons so employed & the amount of the Salary the accounts for which will be included in your quarterly salary accounts—It will be
<pb#75/>
necessary for you to procure a standard Chain & Compass—The standard Chain should be made in conformity, to that in the possession of M* Geo Davis at Washington, Mississippi or that in possession of Gen' Coffee. You will establish a correct Meridian line at or near your office, by which all the Compasses used in Surveying will be regulated, & all lines will be run agreeably to the true Meridian, all the instruments for taking the necessary observations for establishing the Latitude & Longitude of any place, were formerly purchased by Mº Biggs “ & left with the Surveyor General at Washington, you will correspond with M* Davis on this subject, & when the instruments are required by you I will instruct M. Davis to have them forwarded to any person you may authorise to recieve them at New Orleans—
They will probably require cleaning & repairing. A volume of the Land Laws and the Laws of the last Session have been forwarded to you,” I now send the 6* Volume of the Laws of the United States, & the acts passed subsequent to those contained in that volume, which will give you a complete series of all the Laws relative to the public Lands "*-

<place-time>ST. AUGUSTINE East Florida August 30° 1824–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. Considering you as the chosen guardian of the Rights of all American citizen, I do not shrink from addressing you on the present occasion, though I premise that I am the last person who would be anxious on Evry Occurrence to intrude myself on you. But now I
am so assured that there is none but you, to whom I can apply with any prospect of redress for the injury and outrage that have lately been committed on my person, that I am confident that I should be wanting to myself and doing injustice to the Laws of my Country were I not to complain The simple narration of my grievances will suffice to explain the cause and motive of my complaint, and be sufficient to interest you so far as to require a more full examination into the case—
A few weeks ago Judge Smith of this city came into a Room where there was a Billiard Table of which I was at that time the Keeper, and commenced playing with one Gomez;” this was Early in the day of Saturday the 7" Inst. and continued at the game till late at night Throught the games it was evident to all bystanders that Judge Smith's conduct was very unfair though no one spoke so long as his opponent did not complain In the mean time his Honor became very noisey and boisterous and betrayed evry excess of an ungovernable temper which from regard to his Office and dread of his strength passed unresented till about Ten O’clock at night he (Judge Smith) played evidently so unfair that I enquired whether I should notice some advantage and success he claimed, when Judge Smith demanded whether there were any foul Strokes at the Table I told him there were, to which he in a
<pb#77/>
most insulting and abusive maner replyed by calling me a damned fool and said where are your Rules. I told him we had none but General Rules, he repeated you are fool—a damned Liar—and a damned Villain and scounderall and became so Enraged at being detected in Cheating
(not very uncommon as many of his associates in this City will Swear.) That he seized, and as I supposed intended to choak me which induced me to endeavour to repulse him; at which he took a large Stick that was near and beat me in the most unmerciful maner. I
made several attempts to escape and beged him for Gods Sake to desist as he was murdering me which I solemly beleive he would have done; had not M* Edgar Macon the Attorney General (who keeps his Office and Sleeps near the Room where the scene took place) been brought by the noise to the Spot at whose presence Smith desisted.
For several days after this I was confined to my bed and had to be attended by a Surgeon who declared as his opinion that my cheek bones had been broken.
My circumstances in life are humble, and I have been unfortunate;
but it is in the power of no One, to say any thing that implicates my character. I have the Honor to be known by the Secretary of War, and he can vouch for the statement I have last made, could I procure redress at Law I would not trouble you but the Territorial Judicial System is so defective that it cannot be had indead if I am not very much mistaken Judge Smith boasts that he is above the Law or at least that it cannot reach him, a truth which we are implled to admit, since we have seen several attacked for contempt of Court who dared to complain and the prosecuting Attorney threatened with imprisonment for suffering witnesses to be sworn to give evidence to the Grand Jury, for assaults and batteries committed by his Honor I do not appeal to your excellency with the foolish Expectation that any thing will be done hastily on your part, but as an American I demand that I
shall be heard I also beg that you will take into consideration the Effect Judge Smiths example will have on this community (who are already exclaiming against the American Officers;) if it should go unpunished should you not think the depositions I herewith forward you sufficient to justify an enquirey in the case I beg you will call on Mº Macon the U. S. Attorney The information he will give for he witnessed the conclusion of the Transaction will satisfy you that the case merits a full investigation This I ask and pray you will give Before I conclude I will remind you that a complaint similar to this was made last winter to Congress but which was never acted on It is true that the Grand Jury of the last Superior Court, did vindicate Judge Smith, but it disgusted evry honest gentleman of the community and was procured by the most dishonorable chicanery that ever dis-
<pb#78/>
graced a subservient Jury—In the Examination I wish Judge Smith may be heard, and I am willing to be confronted with him *

COL” ROBERT BUTLER Sur. Gen. of Florida.-
SIR. An act having passed on the 24th May last changing the mode of surveying the Public Lands on any river, lake, or water course,” you are hereby authorized, to depart from the ordinary mode of surveying Lands adjoining Lakes or Water Courses, whenever in your opinion the situation of the lands, the accommodation of settlers, or the interest of the Government, may make it expedient, and Survey the same in conformity to the provisions of the Act above referred to.
It will in many situations be impracticable to survey the lands in strict conformity to the provisions of this Act, in respect to the prescribed front and depth, but there must be as near an approximation, to the rule prescribed as the localities will permit.
In executing the Surveys under the provisions of this Act, I would recommend that the traverses of the water courses, within the limits of any Township or fractional township, be accurately taken and platted down, that an experimental line be laid down as nearly parallel to the meanders of the water course as circumstances may make expedient, and at a distance which shall generally be equal to
<pb#79/>
front equal to two acres, and be forty acres in depth, this plat will be transferred to the ground by running the necessary lines and marking the corners and bearing trees.
The corners on the water course & the back corners of each lot should be well marked—I should not think it necessary to run & mark more than the divisional lines, of every eighth lot, which would be the line of the Section or Fractional Section, and which on the Township plat should be coloured black, the division lines of the lots in each section, or fractional section may be coloured in Red ink.
I enclose for your information the copy of two township plats of Land on the Mississippi which have been surveyed in pursuance to the provisions of the 5* Section, of the Act of 1812.* The front lots in this plat contain about 160 acres and the mode of numbering the lots and sections has been approved. As the lots to be surveyed agreeably to the act of the 24” of May 1824. will contain about 80 acres only—
I suggest the propriety of numbering them agreeably to the enclosed diagram, marked A.
Some discretion must be exercised by the Deputy Surveyor in laying down the line parrellel to the Water Course—acute bends on the river will necessarily form fractional lots of very irregular forms and varying from the prescribed front and depth.
I presume that there is a considerable portion of the lands in your District and particularly in East Florida lying on the seaboard, bays, Lakes, and water Courses which it may be deemed expedient to survey agreeably to this mode. You will probably also it find it expedient to apply this mode of surveying to any small spaces lying between Private surveys bounded by water courses.”—
Respectfully &c.

As it is contemplated to open a road from Pensacola to S' Augustine, if the troops are sent to this point they can at once commence working on the road in this vicinity, and their presence will induce the Indians to move off quietly—I fear they may do some mischeif about the time of their departure expecting in the confusion to escape detection.”

Mº Bellamy is a man of wealth enterprise and of strict honesty, if he makes any contract it will be fulfilled to your satisfaction. This gentleman has a number of slaves and could do the work principally with his own force I believe it would be greately to the interest of the United States to make such a contract it would save much expence and leave the military force to be used for other objects. I do not know whether the President of the United States is vested with power by the act of Congress to make such a contract, but if he is he will no doubt do so.

<place-time>PENSACOLA, September 1* 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to report that the Detachment of the
4* Infy. on extra duty under my direction returned to Cantonment Clinch on the 29* Inst: & were reported to the Commanding officer of the Regiment for duty, having completed the road to Fort Mitchell.
I enclose a Statement of the extra expense incurred by the Quartermaster's department,” being $.1000 less than my estimate, although I was compelled to hire one Team, (causing one third of the entire expense,) during the whole time, in consequence of having sent the oxen, which I contemplated using on the Road when I made the estimate, to Tampa Bay on the Requisition of Colonel Brooke, and
<pb#83/>
where its services were indispensably necessary. I purchased two wagons, & two mules to complete the Teams I had left; but these were wanting for the service in any event, are still on hand as good as when purchased, and therefore caused no extra expense. The distance proved to be somewhat greater than I expected, (caused by necessary deviations from the Trail,) being 218 miles to the point where it intersects the “Federal Road”; but it is full 300 miles, if not more to the same point by the route the mail now travels from this place. The Soldiers, though Recruits joined from the north last spring, have experienced no sickness of consequence,—(one man only having died & his death was caused by the bite of a Snake, -) a practical proof that labor in the open high woods of the South is not prejudicial to the health of Soldiers.”
I have with considerable trouble procured mules for Capt. Clark
& have them in readiness to send down by the first vessel. They will be there before it would be safe for him to expose himself or men on the Survey in the low country & Swamps through which his route lies.” These mules cost very high, but that was unavoidable. We wanted none but well broke mules & there were none of any kind in the market at Mobile, consequently I had to purchase them of such persons as had them in constant service & not over anxious to sell;
moreover the trouble & expense of having them delivered at Pensacola, (as they were bought scattering & at a distance of 90 miles,)

<place-time>PENSACOLA 34 Sept. 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR On the first of March last, I became the proprietor of the establishment composing the office of the Floridian, which was discontinued, and the Pensacola Gazette & West Florida Advertiser established in its stead. The Floridian having been authorised to publish the Laws of the U. S. letter of 13" November 1823;* a letter was addressed to you immediately after the transfer, informing you thereof and also authorising me to receive the amount of compensation which is to be paid, which was signed by Mess” John Fitzgerald &
C" and myself.” I am thus particular because the papers sent to me containing the laws &c have always been addressed to J. F. & Cº
I have now completed the publication of all the laws I have received
(the book not yet having come to hand). I had marked the laws published, in the list in the Intelligencer; that I might inform you of what I had not received, but the paper has been mislaid & I am not able now to inform you. So soon as the pamphlet is received I shall publish the Laws which are now deficient (which are only 3 or 4).
I beg leave respectfully to request that my name may be placed on the list of Publishers of the Laws, in the place of Messrs Fitzgerald & Cº.—
who do not publish a paper.
Permit me, in addition to the preceding, to mention a fact unconnected therewith.-I am acting as Deputy for Col: John Miller, Clerk of the United States' District and Superior Court of West Florida, which court commenced operations here in October 1822. The Clerk's accounts have regularly been made out, certified by the Judge &
forwarded to the proper department at Washington by the Marshal;
owing to the accounts for Territorial business being included they were not allowed, but information was received that they would be returned here to take out the charges exclusively on United States’
business which would then be paid; this was more than three months
<pb#85/>
ago & the accounts have not been received back yet. there is upwards of 700$ due the Clerk on U.S. business only, which he is thus deprived of, either by accident or neglect:
You will please excuse my troubling you with this information as it is very desirable that an account of so long standing be settled & I do not know that it is known in Washington in what situation we are in regard to them.”
I have the honor to be, Sir with sentiments of the highest Respect, Your Obt Servít:

<docbody>SIR, I consider it my duty, in the absence of the District Judge to inform you, that on the night of the 28th ulto. William F. Steele District Attorney absconded from this place, leaving his Securities in a prison Bounds Bond, liable for the Judgments on which he was imprisoned—
The means by which Mr. S. was enabled to effect this last, tho not the least of his improprieties, was as follows—The Revenue Cutter Florida was directed by the Collecter of Key West, to bring into this Port the Schooner “Fellspoint” of Baltimore, charged with Smuggling—A prize Master was put on board of her, and she sent here for condemnation, and arrived here sometime before the Florida. Her papers were delivered to the Collector of this Port, who instructed the Attorney, to draw a Libel to obtain an order of Seizure—He neglected it for three weeks, until the arrival of the Florida Cutter—when he privately informed the Officers of that Vessel, that Justice could not be procured at Pensacola; and incouraged them to carry the prize off—
The Collector of this Port refused to give up the papers, alledging that the Wessel was sent here for adjudication, and should not leave the Port until she was tried; whereupon the Attorney advised that she should go without her papers; and that night about 12 o'clock he broke the Bounds and took passage, either in the Smuggling Schooner, or the Cutter—Some of those who have supported him, for his abuse of honest men, and a belief that he was a good partizan of a faction, from the facility with which he writes news paper lampoons, affect to believe that he will return; whilst the more sober, descreet, and respectable part of the community, believe we shall never see him again, and look upon it, as an incident long since expected, and which must have happened, had it not been for the support given to him, from the motives above mentioned."

<docbody>SIR, I consider it proper to call your attention to to the situation of the bond given by the present United States Marshal for the Eastern district of Florida, for the faithful performance &c. The securities in that bond are William Travers and Pedro Miranda.
When that bond was taken, Mr Travers was ostensably a gentleman of independant fortune. Since, however he has made a disposition of most of his property, and contemplates, and I believe will in a short time remove to the island of Cuba, to join his connextions, who removed to that country when Florida was ceded to the United States.
Mr. Miranda is a gentleman of no personal property; that which he has in his possession, he states to belong to his wife, by virtue of the late Spanish institutions. The Landed property of Mr Miranda, consists chiefly of a large grant, purporting to have been made by one of the Spanish governors of this province; the title, however, I consider extremely equivical. I also know of my own knowledge, that Mr Miranda is somewhat embarrassed.
I presume you are not unacquainted with the circumstances of the Marshal—
I have thought it incumbent on me, in consequence of my office, to inform you of the above information, that you may avail yourself of the same, as you think proper—
With great respect, I remain Your very humble & ob" servant EDGAR MACON U. S. Atty. E. Florida HON. S. PLEASONTON.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE Oct 1. 1824</place-time>
<docbody>HONB" JoHN C. CALHOUN Secretary at War SIR On yesterday I had the honor to receive your letter of the
17* of last Aug" * and confess that some remarks in it surprise me greatly. In the first place I assure you the Agent did not pay one cent either in money or Cattle to the Chief Neamathla altho he informed me he had funds in his hands (I believe he said you had authorised him to draw for $6,000)
I did order the agent to pay this Chief and was much disappointed when I found on my arrival here that it had been neglected. You state “The agent has rendered a statement of his accounts by which it appears he has advanced under your orders, on a contract made by you with Mr Charis the sum of $3.000”. Their must be surely some great mistake in this matter for I never made a contract with M*
Chaires (except for the rations which was long since the Agent left this part of the country, and on which I did not advance him a cent or agree to do so. Nor have I ever heard from the agent that he paid the sum of $3,000 to M' Chaires or that he had made any contract with him or any other person for the purchase of Stock cattle.
long since the agent left this part of the country I was informed by a letter from Mr Chaires that he had made a contract with the agent Col Humphreys for Stock Cattle, but he never informed me that the agent had paid him one dollar in advance Nothing more is known to me of the contract, nor has the agent made any report to me of the fact. Altho he wrote to me on the 26* of July from St Augustin, a copy of his letter I enclose to you. The agent has never as I now recollect presented any of his accounts to me for my examination or approval. I have been always ready to attend to my duty in this respect. The agent received from me written instructions on the subject of receiving proposals on the 23° of May last 74 for furnishing of the rations to the Indians, as well as on the subject of contract-
<pb#92/>
ing for Stock Cattle. My instructions directed him only to receive proposals and to transmit them to me, and if any of the proposals should be approved of by the proper authorities the party would be duly informed &c.
Enclosed is a copy of a letter from the agent dated St Marks 1.
June 1824 and also a copy of a letter dated Tallahassee 31. May 1824
from Mº Chaires to the agent. M' Chaires' proposals I would not accept at 18% cents, as I informed you. I also enclose to you an extract of that part of my instructions to the agent on the Subject of purchasing Stock Cattle My reasons for allowing the agent at his discression, if it was necessary to do so to advance $3,000 for the Stack Cattle was that few men could purchase and incur the expence of driving a large heard of Cattle so far into the interior—and those who had the means to make the advance, would not perhaps engage in the contract. It is important to act promptly with the Indians in paying up what they claim under the Treaty without delay The very circumstance of the Indians learning that their agent was purchasing Stock Cattle for them, to be driven within their boundary would induce many of them to remove chearfully—who at the time were much dissatisfyed—besides, I was confident if the contract was made for Cows & Calves—in the spring to be delivered this fall, that a very considerable advantage would accrue to the Indians, as the cattle would be growing for six or seven months at the risque and expence of the contractor, Under this view I gave the instruction Just in the words written, which is all that was given on this part of the subject. If the five Chiefs had gone with the agent to Washington, and which I desired it would have answered a good purpose You well know that during the absence of the Chiefs the Indians would not have acted the least improper the Chiefs would be by the nation considered as hostages in our hands for their good behavour until their return at least. Hence I wished the leading Chiefs to visit you.
It would allow me time to make in peace and quietness all my contracts for their removal and at the same time you would have made an impression on the chiefs that would have confirmed them forever as our decided friends, but as the chiefs failed to go & as the Indians were ready to take up arms the agent should never have left the Territory without permission under such circumstances.
I believe you will be perfectly satisfied with my management and economy in executing the treaty—and whatever I do shall be performed with a single eye to the public interest "
I am Respectfully Your Obt. Servt.

SIR I have just received your note informing me that my proposals for furnishing the entire ration for the Indians was the lowest and accepted.
I presume the Governor, nor yourself will doubt that my best exertions will be used to comply fully with the contract. Permit me to remark however that this contract in the way which it has to be filled is unwieldy and no time ought to be lost. I hope the Governor will say as soon as consistent to whom the bond shall be given for the fulfilment of it, and the Contract formally entered into until that is done it will be hazardous for me to purchase Cattle, which must be brought from Georgia, or to make the necessary arrangement for the purchase and Shipping of Corn and Salt. I shall nevertheless risqe the consequences & commence making the arrangements necessary to be made and continue so doing until advised to the contrary Houses for the reception of the corn and Salt must be prepared which I
presume will be done under your direction at the expence of the U. S.

SIR Enclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit to you all the proposals made for Supplying the Indians according to the Treaty with, Beef, Flour, Corn and Salt.
Those of Maj" Benj" Chaires of St Augustine taking into view the Ampleness of his Security in connection with the lowness of the price at which he offers to furnish the supplies, I could not hesitate to consider “the best” and have therefore under your Instructions of the
16" Ult” advised him that his proposal for the entire Ration with be accepted. Should this Mode of Supplying be approved by the proper authority, accompanying this you will will receive a Copy of his letter in reply—The proposal of M" Robt. Mitchel of Pensacola for the Salt & Flour part of the Ration would have been accepted as the lowest, had it not been saddles with provisos and Conditions foreign to my advertisment in relation to security (which Mº Mitchel was well aware of) been complied with.
As it is however whatever Confidence I might have in his declaration of Ability to guarantee the performance of an engagement of such magnitude I could not feel myself authorised or warrented to Jeopardize the interests of the Country or the Comfort of the Indians by leaving the supplying of provisions to depend upon a Contingency so precarious and unpromising, particularly as an opportunity presented to place the contract for the whole Ration upon terms which appear highly advantagous to the Gov" in the hands of an individual whose responsability and qualifycations are unquestionable and without exception.

D* SIR After waiting at Tampa Bay untill the 17. Inst for an answer to my application to you for a short leave of absence, without receiving one, I was led to the conclusion that your Messenger had failed on the way, and believing your letter if received, would favour my wishes, and believing also that the indulgence (although in some degree conditional) contained in your letter of instructions of the 16”
of May, Might in the exigency of my case be embraced without impropriety or injury to the public Service I am induced to proceed
<pb#95/>
without further delay to the North—Where by recent letters I learn that my presence is much required in a business Matter of considerable importence to me. I shall however go by the way of Washington City, and be governed by such information or instructions as I may there receive from the Secretary of War, I have not now time to make a detailed report of my tour into the Indian country from the Bay.
I can only say that the land throughout where I visited is wretchedly bad, and in my opinion cannot long sustain the Indians should any considerable number come from the West.
I am truly sorry to differ so widely in opinion from Col. Gadsden, for whom I have the highest respect, but I conceive to withhold the expression of my sentiments on this subject (although they are unasked) would be to fail in my official obligations, and might possibly hereafter subject me to unmerited censure. I am further urged to the avowal from an interview I had a few days since with Miconopy, Jumper and other Chiefs, near Okihumky. It seems evident that, that article in the treaty providing for an extension of the Northern boundary will be insisted upon by the Indians and I feel it a duty to state a failure in this particular on the part of the Goverment will produce much dissatisfaction among them and may lead to serious difficulty. It is due to the Indians however to say that as far as can be ascertained they are perfectly pacific in disposition and appear to place great reliance on the Justice and fidelity of the United States I cannot close this letter without doing an actof justice to Col. Gadsden in declaring my belief that the Story told me by Neamathla of the Col” having advised him against the journey to Washington is destitute of foundation in truth and that it is a tale fabricated by the old Man to Justify his own discrepency. This I Judge from discovering on the subject a sort of concert between him and the Chiefs South, this is evident though each avows ignorence of the others sentiments and says he cannot act in the case without a meeting, thus Clearly manifesting a wish to avoid the measure, but whether this proceeds from aversion to extend their acquaintence with the whites or a fear of being entrapped (as has been intimated to me)
I am unable to say. The latter is very possible as they have still fresh in recollection the treachery practised on their nation in a Somewhat similar occasion by the Spanish Goverment at St. Augustine and they are not thoroughly capable of making a proper distinction between that Goverment and the one under which they now live—I
will write again from Washington I am with the highest Respect & Esteem Your Obt Servt

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE Oct 2" 1824</place-time>
<docbody>HoNB” JoHN C. CALHOUN Secretary at War SIR. The object of this letter is to explain to you my objects and views in relation to the removal of the Indians as well as the reasons for their immediate payment under the treaty of such sums as can be paid with Justice and propriety before their removal. You have long since been apprised that the Seminoles were very much dissatisfied with the treaty "–I therefore deem it prudent before their removal to pay them for their improvements according to the treaty; valued as you have directed. I intend to call the Indians to St Marks and to pay them and furnish as many rations at that point as will serve them on their march to the country assigned them. I have held out as an inducement for the Indians to go in canoes by water & thus provide for their own transportation, a certain sum of from $5 to $10 for each canoe they should make for this purpose which should be paid by me to the individuals who made them, after the acting sub-agent should see these canoes and report the size & number of them to me. I expect perhaps forty or fifty canoes will be ready in three weeks. I find it very difficult to purchase a horse of any kind here and as some must be had, I shall send a man to procure a few in Georgia, The Stack cattle intended for the Indians South will be driven there as soon as I
can ascertain any contract has been made for them—
The Gun-Smith, who should also be a Blacksmith, I will procure if the agent does not. The ploughs, hoes, axes, &c will be sent to Tampa Bay as soon after the removal of the Indians as a vessel can be had to transport them from Pensacola; where these articles have just arrived accoring to my order—The Apalachicola Indians being stationary ought to have their part of the $6,000 paid to them immediately & also their sheare of the annuity. I have therefore made engagements to have them furnished with cattle, & some sheep, as many of them now spin, and several of them weave, & also ploughs &c amounting to $800 which was the sum allowed to them out of the
$6.000, and was much less than it should have been, Of the anuity the Apalachicola Indians should be allowed $1,500 per. year, for on the reserves there are two hundred & forty men, besides their women &
children & they are at least one fourth of the whole population. Be-
Side these people will receive no benefit of the school or the Gun &
Black Smith I hope therefore as the power is with the President to say what proportion of annuity shall be given to them, that the facts
<pb#97/>
above stated will have their due weight. You will see by the contract which I made with M'. Chaires for the delivering of the rations,” that he was to issue only for ten months at Tampa Bay, my reasons for this was, that by furnishing the Indians in this quarter with rations it would induce them to sell out their Crops, and add to the inducements for them to remove, beside the ration is furnished by Capt Crupper one cent cheaper than those furnished by Mr Chaires This step I feel confident was as judicious as prudent; and I daily see the effects anticipated. I have not as yet paid Capt Crupper who has furnished all the rations at St Marks up to this time one cent.
This has resulted of course for the want of funds. On refering to your letter of the 20th of last April "you acknowledge the recpt of my letter of the 25 March * enclosing the estimate of expences on account of Indian affairs under my Superintendency for the two first quarters of the present year, which estimate you say is admitted
[I have not as yet received any remittance on the estimate to enable me to defray the ordinary and usual expences of the Indian Department.—Whatever sum was placed under the controul of the agent, none of it has come to my hands, and I trust the amount of my estimate admitted may be remitted without delay. I wish to close my accounts as soon as the papers & vouchers of the Indian department, now at St Augustine shall arrive which I hope will be by the first of Nov.
next as I have determined to charter a small vessel, & have so directed, to transport the public reccords of all the departments, together with the books and furniture of the Legislative Council, and such as belong to the Secretary's & superintendants office to St Marks I am the more anxious to carry the treaty into effect & complete all the contracts at an early date, because I must return this winter for my family to Kentucky. This has also induced me to request that I
may not be longer delayed for want of funds.] *
I have sent to New Orleans for the money mentioned in your last letter, intended for the objects mentioned therein & amounting altogether to $13,500, this was absolutely necessary as paper money will not be received by the Indians, and the silver could not be had short of New Orleans, the moment I receive the specie it shall be paid over to the Indians, and they forthwith shall march to their
<pb#98/>
future residence This will be about the last of this month. You may rest perfectly satisfied that the appropriation under no state of things shall be exceeded—but every attention shall be given to the reduction of the expences consistant with Justice and good faith to the Indians “”
I am Respectfully Your Obt Servt.

War Department Off Indian Affairs SIR Your letter of the 7" of last Aug" * was receved on the
30th Ult” I rejoice that the Goverment has determined to pay every attention to the encouragement and cultivation of morals amoungst the Indians. It is in vain to expect that civilization can be extended among these people unless they are made to understand right and wrong, and nothing would have so powerful an influance in producing this effect as the example of those persons whome the Goverment has placed over these unfortunate people.
Instructions shall be given in conformity to your directions to all under my controul who have any intercourse with the Indians—I
will aid most cheerfully and earnestly in contributing all in my power to effect the benevolent and virtuous objects of my Goverment. The state of the Indians in a moral point of view in Florida would shame their more polished white brothers. drunkenness is the only common vice that they commit. They are generally honest and chaste, & many of them industrious.
I am truly gratify'd that you are placed at the head of the office of Indian Affairs. and I calculate that several important improvements will be made under your management—
I am with high Respect & Esteem Your Obt Servt Wm P. DUVAL
|Endorsed] Tallahassee, Oct' 3" 1824. Wºn P. DuVal—Relative to the civilization of the Indians, will give all the aid in his power to effect the benevolent objects of the Government—

<docbody>DEAR SIR Immediately on my arrival on last Monday at this place I delivered the letters to Dº" Simmons & Gibson * & went with them the next morning to see Mess"Reynolds & Alvarez Mº Reynolds has since refused to deliver the papers until an inventory of them was made out and a receipt for them given him in complying with which requisition they are now every day employed I regret that the orders of Government were not immediately complied with and was ready as one to take the papers by a duces tecum bring them before the commissioners & deliver them to Drs Simmons & Gibson. But on enquiry I was induced to believe that at this time there was not suficient danger of any thing improper being done to or with the papers to justify it & being sensible the administration wa not wish us to resort to any unnecessary harshness Any further proceeding was omitted. I found my brother commissioners occupied in the daily examination of claims presented to their consideration. The second day after my arrival I entered on the duties of my situation & have ever since been employed according to the best of my ability in their discharge From the closest observation I am satisfied in my own mind that the Government has made a most fortunate selection in the appointment.
I am fully convinced that they are both men of the most just &
honorable feeling Judge Floyd it is true is not possessed of any extraordinary Superiority of intellect altho' I have no doubt he has a very good judgment and the very best intentions. And any mistake into which he may have fallen I should be inclined to attribute altho only by surmise to his more highy-gifted associate Judge Blair but permit me to add that both Judge Blair & M." Floyd have the popular opinion of this territory in their favor it being the universal opinion that they were men of the greatest honor & integrity. The Government too are exceedingly fortunate in the district attorney for East Florida He is an invaluable officer faithful & indefatigable in his duty to the United States and examines rigidly & industriously into the justice and legality of every claim that is presented to the commissioners We are exceedingly embarrassed for the want of clerks. our clerk says he has one case in which it would take him three months to translate the necessary papers & nearly as much longer to copy them He declares it would take him twelve months to do all the necessary writing to enable us to report on the cases on which we have already
<pb#100/>
adjudicated. In Lousiana I am informed the commissioner had for some time six or seven clerks simultaneously employed I would recommend that the board of commissioners should be authorised to employ assistant clerks to our secretary; to write at ten or fifteen cents for every hundred words and to translate at twenty five or thirty seven and a half cents for every hundred words counting the Spanish words. I am satisfied my brother commissioners would not abuse the trust reposed in them & as for myself I solemnly promise to do all I can to have the commission as speedily and economically discharged as possible consistently with my duty to the Government under which I have the high honor of holding my appointment *
With sincerest wishes for your health and prosperity permit me to subscribe myself devotedly yours W H ALLEN
I intended copying this off but our weekly mail is just closing please excuse it. I think we could easily get clerks to copy for ten cents the hundred words & to translate for twenty five W H A

CAPT D. E. BURCH Asst Qr Mr Pensacola SIR Enclosed is a copy of a letter from Governor Duval * in relation to the road from Pensacola to St Augustine, by which it appears that Jno Bellamy Esq, of Florida, proposes to compleat the road for
23.000$–Twenty thousand only have been appropriated.
It is the intention of the SecY of War that as much of the work as possible be done by the troops; but as it is important, not only to the people of Florida, but to the Government, that the road be compleated in the course of the ensuing year, it is submitted to your judgement whether it would not be adviseable to open that part from the proposed seat of Gov' to St Augustine by contract. Having surveyed the road, you are better able to estimate the difficulties presented by the different parts of the route, than any other person.
Should you consider that the public interest would be subserved by making the road from the seat of Government of Florida to St
<pb#101/>
Augustine, or any part of it by contract, you are authorized to invite proposals, & make contracts for the work. From your knowledge of the subject, & the facility with which you may obtain information in regard to the character & circumstances of those who offer, you can readily determine whether the bids be reasonable, & whether there be a probability of those who bid complying with the contract.
In the contracts, care must be taken not to exceed the appropriation.
The law forbids advances; but you might stipulate to pay the contractors at the end of every month for the work actually performed.
The contractors must be entirely under your direction & subject to your order.—The road will be made fifteen or sixteen feet wide.
Should it be found necessary hereafter to increase the width to 25
feet, as proposed by the law, it may be done by the troops.
Would it not be adviseable to commence your operations with the whole force under your direction, in the neighbourhood of the seat of Govt. & work towards Pensacola? The troops employed there might operate as a check upon the Indians. You will however, in this, as in every other matter connected with the duty confided to you, act as you may think best.
If contracts be made, the contractors must enter into bonds, with such sureties as you may think sufficient, for the faithful & prompt performance of the work; their reasponsibility to cease when you shall have recº the road "

<docbody>To HIS EXCELL" WILLIAM P. DUVAL. Tallahassee—
SIR, I have received your letter from Tallahassee of the 31st of August last.”
It would have been better if Mr. Chairs the Contractor, and yourself, had agreed definitively upon the price of the ration, instead of refering it to the decision of the Department. You have, however so unequivocally expressed your recommendation that an increase upon the delivery at Sº Johns River to 14 cents be allowed; and the
<pb#102/>
offer by General Clark " being for that price, and no person having offered for less, I have concluded to approve of your recommendation to allow fourteen cents the ration for the number which may be delivered under the contract at Sº Johns, deducting the one twentieth part of a cent according to M'. Chairs own offer. The delivery at Tampa Bay, & Sº Marks, will be at the contract price, to wit 11%
cents per Ration. You will forward to the Department the original contract, certifying to the solvency of the securities, and retaining for yourself, a copy.
I received Two letters from you, each dated the 12* July *—In one you say “you will appoint a disinterested and suitable person to ascertain the value of the improvements that may be abandoned by the Indians &c”—In the other, “you should be much pleased if Colº.
Gadsden would value the improvements under the Treaty, he could do better than any one I can obtain and would give more satisfaction to the Indians &c.” On this recommendation I accordingly appointed Colº. Gadsden, as per letter of instructions and Commission forwarded to him, thro' you, as per my letter, bearing date the 11” Ultimo.”
I have no objection however to your appointment of M*. Bellamy, provided you can make the proper arrangements with Col”. Gadsden,_In which case the allowance to M'. Bellamy will be the same as that proposed to be made to Col”. Gadsden. Your instructions under your letter of appointment are approved.
I have issued requisitions in your favor under the several heads of appropriation to carry into effect the Treaty with the Florida Indians, $26:105: 50/100—Twelve thousand six hundred and four Dollars, 50/100 of which being on account of the expense of Rations. On the receipt of your quarterly estimates, further remittance will be made according to the information conveyed in my letter of the 11”
Ultimo. The remittance for Indian Improvements will be made when the report of the Commissioner is received, and approved.
All remittances on account of the Indian Department are required to be made on estimates of the Superintendent. You will attend to this in future.
I have issued my requisition in your favor on account of Expenses of your Superintendency, for Two thousand Dollars, to be accounted for in your returns.”
I have &c. &c.

<docbody>To THE HONOBL JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
SIR, We take the first opportunity to acknowlege the receipt of your letter of the 23° of August * directing us to take charge of such of the Archives in the possession of M* Reynolds as relate to the disposition of lands in this Territory. The day subsequent to the receipt of our instructions we communicated them to M* Reynolds & requested him to inform us when he could deliver to us the papers referred to; stating that we were ready to receive them. Mº Reynolds replied, that from the nature of those papers, & the state in which they were in, he should decline delivering them unless a complete Inventory was made & a receipt given for them. The Inventory to be made either by himself, & or by us conjointly with him. The papers to remain under his charge & controul, & we to have no other controul over them than to assist in making the Inventory, & examining them, but with permission to take under our charge each day such papers as were contained in the Inventory & receipted for.
From the nature of our instructions & from a conversation with M* Allen we were induced to believe, that this course would not
<pb#104/>
altogether comport with your views on the subject. If the making of the Inventory was left to him alone, there was no knowing when it would be finished; and if made by us conjointly with him, some time, we cannot say how long must necessarily elapse before the whole of the Archives embraced in our instructions could be under our controul. The Inventory contemplated being to be made in the following form, it must require some time to make it.
Date of memorial Date of Grant No of acres No || Grantor || Grantee
1 | White Medecis 1** July. 1810 || 1st Aug. 1810 two hundred— In acceding to the proposition of M* Reynolds, we should but little procrastinate the final accomplishment of the object of our instructions; but believing it to be your wish that an immediate controul over the papers, should be given to us, we proposed to M*
Reynolds, that we should mutually consider the papers as delivered to us; to go on & make the Inventory, but neither him, nor us to have access to, or controul over the papers except in the presence of the other. From delicacy to M* Reynolds we proposed that this arrangement should be known only to ourselves.
To this proposition or to any other by which he should be deprived of the absolute controul of any paper until it was inventoried, & a receipt given for it he declared his determined resolution to object.
Under these circumstances we have been compelled to accede to the proposition of M* Reynolds, & have commenced making out the Inventory, & shall receive the papers as they are included in the Inventory. Believing that in pursuing this course we shall in the shortest possible time, under the determination of M* Reynolds, obtain the controul of the Archives, & fulfil the object of our instructions.
In the mean time we have communicated our instructions, & the result of our endeavours to procure the papers to the Board of Land Commissioners. What order, if any, the Board may take on the subject we are unable to say. Two of the Board M. Allen & Col.
Murray, have said, privately, that M* Reynolds ought to have acceded to our proposition & delivered over the papers at once.
During the two last years it has been a source of surprize, regret
& complaint by the owners of land in the Territory, that the Keeper of the Archives should allow the papers to remain in the state in which they have been, and are now—Any person might slip out a grant for 100 acres, & put in one for 10,000. That this was ever done
<pb#105/>
except in one case, I do not pretend to say. All we know is, that in that case a reward was offered by Mº Reynolds for the detection of the person who had taken out a small grant & put in one for 15,000
acres.
Honored by the trust committed to us we hope to be able to execute it so as to give satisfaction, and that what we have done will meet with your approbation. We would however observe, that as individuals we would prefer the course proposed by Mº Reynolds, as it would relieve us from the possibility of any censure being cast on us in relation to any grant, since no new paper could be foisted in or any old one withdrawn; believing however that it was your desire that the papers should come as soon as possible under our controul we were willing to take the responsibility upon ourselves, as our first proceeding would be to make a complete Index to each set of papers.
M* Reynolds informs us that the office has been closed, & no business done in it since he received the orders from the Department of State. And at the same time very singularly states that our not receiving certain papers, which he had refused to deliver without an an Inventory, caused an interruption to the business of the Land Commission.
We were repeatedly at the office during the day examining papers, & no hint was given that there were any ready for delivery.
We have commenced receiving them & shall take them day by day as the Inventory is made out.” "
We remain very respectfully Your ob. Sevt."

<place-time>• TALLAHASSEE Oct. 26* 1824</place-time>
HoNº" John C. CALHOUN Secretary at War I have just received your letter of the 11" of September last “and regret that my quarterly estimates were not sooner transmitted to your department. I was under the impression that a general estimate for the year only was required. This omission has resulted from the unusual press of business for some time past, which for want of assistance has ocupied me so much as to injure my health seriously.
<pb#107/>
I have now the honor to transmit to you, two estimates for the first and second quarters. I assure you that under no circumstances will I exceed the appropriation of $65,700 in furnishing rations to the florida emigrant Indians In a few days I shall for the last time assemble them at Sº Marks to deliver them their orders to move, and supply them with Rations for the Journey, and such means of transportation as I am able to command The requisition for $13,500 mentioned in your letter and the Draft for the same on the Branch Bank of the United States at New Orleans were received and duly acknowledged. I had long since applied to C*James Gadsden to value the Indian improvements but the death of his venerable Father and his private affairs induced him to decline acting. I therefore appointed John Bellamy Esq a gentleman of known reputation and Standing who has performed this disagreable duty.
The difficulty of reconciling the Indians to the late treaty; and to restrain them from outrage has not been inconsiderable, but to purswade and threaten them into a peaceable removal from this truly delightful country, required the exercise of uncommon patience, time, and prudence. I now believe confidently they will go without force, but evidently with reluctance. I hesitate not to aver that even now, was I to leave this country not one would move; when it is recollected that the Florida Indians never were controuled untill the United States took possession of this country and that even since they have not for the greater part of the time had either an agent or subagent with them to inform and reduce them to order; it must be obvious that my duties have been as arduous as they are unpleasant.
Many of the Indians speak of joining the Creek nation, and my opinion is that several hundred will go north. I have not dissuaded them this Step, or encouraged them to leave the Territory. That portion of the annuity which is to be distributed among the Indians who are to remove South to the lands alloted to them under the treaty will not be given to them untill their removal. This will be an inducement to hasten their march as they are informed by me that untill they are located no such distribution will be made.
I consider it would however be just and proper to pay them for their improvements on the eve of their departure. These people are extreemly poor, more so than any Indians in all the southern country The money distributed to them for their improvements will furnish them with Blankets & such things as will render them comfortable in some degree on their march, and will give them a stronger desire to shear the annuity—I have therefore sent to New Orleans for the specie to meet this object and to provide them transportation (for
37.8835–58—7
<pb#108/>
they will not receive any paper money) and it is expected in eight or ten days.
In my letter of the 2" day of October last,” the reasons were assigned for my not contracting for the delivery of rations at Tampa Bay for a longer period than ten months. The Indians by receiving rations at St Marks have been induced to sell their crops and whenever the issues are stoped they will be compelled to remove.
The commission and instructions to Co' Gadsden are received as well as the Drafts for $12,650 50/100 $5000 payable at Charleston and $7,650 50/100 at New Orleans The certified returns of the rations that have been, and will be delivered at Sº Marks, will, as soon as the final meeting with the Indians is over, be transmitted to you—
I have according to the power given to me by your letter of the
17* day of August last " appointed Oren Marsh Esq’ acting sub agent for one year from the 1* day of September last and he immediately entered on the duties of his office and has continued to act much to my satisfaction—
I have but lately returned from the Appalachicola river, where I
was compelled to attend to receive some stock Cattle & Sheep for the Indians residing there there, and on the 10* of November next the residue of the Stock will be delivered to them, for all that I contracted for were not deliverd on the 15" of this month as I had expected.
These Indians are more civilised than any others in Florida. The Sheep were purchased at their own solicitation in lieu of Hogs, of which they have large Stocks,—the houses and fields of these people are equal to the best of the improvements among the white people in this Section of Florida.
While writing this letter I received one from C* Gadsden’ in which he informs me that he has resingned his seat in our council, and would not be in this quarter shortly as he intended to complete the survey of the land alloted South to the Indians. I therefore took the liberty of opening your letter of instructions to him * relating to the valuation of the Indian improvements and find that my instructions to Mr Bellamy only differed from yours, so far only, as the naming of the individuals that are to receive compensation. I directed the valuation to be made of each town. I was influenced in giving this direction
<pb#109/>
by knowing that many of the Southern Indians have no name. The chiefs are named, but the common men generally must perform some serviceable act. before they receive any name, It is with them a mark of honor, hence it will be impossible in many instances to obtain the name of the Indians.
I intend to pay them off by towns, and will require each Chief of a town to sign the receipt, for the money payed to the Indians of his town for improvements, this is the only way that this business can be satisfactorily performed—After the number of houses and improvements are assertained and valued the Chiefs can then point out the men who are intitled to compensation, so that he can not impose on me more, than, the number I have had valued and it will be his interest to give satisfaction to those men who are alone, entitled to compensation by personally calling them up before all the town to receive payment—
The difficulty of communiting with any post office, for the nearest to this point is 150 miles, has induced me to take more responsibility on myself than I should have assumed could I readily communicate with you. The expence of establishing an express for this purpose would have been too expensive, and as I wish to act with the utmost economy, I have avoided every expence that was not indispensable to the transaction of business"—

<place-time>PENSACOLA, October 31* 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, It is with great reluctance I ever ask for additional allowances, for fear it may be thought I do so from motives of gain alone. But I was under the necessity of making an extra charge while employed on the Road to Fort Mitchell to reimburse my extra expenses & I am again constrained for the same reason to solicit respectfully your attention to the subject, and as there is a Special appropriation for opening the Road to St: Augustine, to request that I may be allowed to charge in my accounts a per diem of $.2, while employed on it. This Sum I conceive is a small allowance compared with the trouble, fatigue, & exposure to which I am subjected; and I
know it to be as little as will enable me to meet the extra expenses I am unavoidably exposed to in consequence of this duty. It is certain that when travelling to & from the Detachment & on duties connected with its labor, I am allowed to charge transportation, but that is not sufficient on such short journies to meet the extra expense it occasions;–travelling here with horses, servant &c. &c. in the woods is not performed at as little expense, nor with the same ease as in Steam Boats & Stage Coaches. I beg leave too, to urge in favor of my claim that the duty is in itself extra service not of the kind contemplated in par: 9, Art: 69, Gen: Regns; and that it is in addition to the duties performed at my office in Pensacola.—
When bringing forward, my own claim for a per diem, I deem it
10 See Gadsden to the Quartermaster General, Nov. 5, 1824 (NA, WD, QMG Lets. Recd., now missing, printed, A.S.P., Mil. Affairs, III, 118; S. Doc. 2, 19
Cong., 1 sess.), reporting that he had reached Kerville Tomoka (variously spelled), a distance of 44 miles from St. Augustine, and that he had selected the Old King's Road to New Symrna as the most feasible route to that place.
<pb#111/>
but right to mention also the case of the officers on duty under my orders in the Quarter Master's Department, and to request that they may be allowed to charge one dollar per day while employed on this Road. I shall have with me at no one time more than are absolutely necessary for the service, & these will be daily & constantly employed.
It is a duty that falls upon but few, and it is within my certain knowledge that it causes to them an expense of treble what they were exposed to at their regular station. It is moreover a duty that officers generally consider out of their line of duty & are therefore averse to performing it.—But if they cannot be allowed a per diem, will you be pleased to inform me whether they will not be entitled to receive an additional ten dollars to their pay for being on duty in the Quartermaster's Department.”—
I have the honor to be Sir, With perfect respect Yr Mo. Ob. Servt.

You will perceive that I am now in advance on account of the Quartermaster's department, and I also owe on that account about
$.3000.-I am about to forward by the Captain of the Florida, to Capt. Clark $.2326, on his Estimate to close his accounts for the last and the current quarter. These Sums I shall take from the funds of the Road, relying upon my next remittances to replace the amount, as I do not want them for immediate use. My payments for the last month have been entirely taken from this fund, but my last draft of
$.5000, already credited in my accounts, will, when the funds shall have been obtained from the Bank, replace that amount.—
I have expended in purchases &c. $.3000 on account of the Road, leaving a balance on hand of $.12000.-With the purchase of two mules
<pb#112/>
I shall now have five good Teams; and with these added to a Boat which I have in employ at $.5 pr. day including four hands, and carrying Eighty Barrels, I shall be able to provide all supplies for a force at work of not less than 100, nor more than 150 men, until the Road is advanced near to the Territorial Seat of Government near Tallahassee; or at least as far as to the Appalachicola River. The Chief expenses therefore will now be for the purchase of forage for the public mules, and payments to the men on extra duty, and the Hire of the Boat before mentioned.—
I request you will be pleased to cause a copy of the Regulations to be forwarded to me. I want it for the use of my office; also a table of the Post routes as furnished from the General Post Office.*—

SIR I have the honor of forwarding herewith the Lists of suits * in which the United States were parties at the January, May and November Terms 1823, being all the Judgements of that nature in the U. S. District & Superior Court, previous to the present Term.
Immediately at the Close of this Term & every Term hereafter the Lists will be regularly forwarded. I have now two blanks only in my office.
You will observe a charge of $8.84 costs in a judgement obtained against Majr Wright;” Execution was stayed in this case by Wm:
F. Steele Esquire U. S. Attorney and I think it my duty to State that Mr S.—informed me that he had collected the Clerk's fees (8.84 as above) but as he has never paid them over & refuses to do so, I have put them in the U. S. Account; presuming that they will be charged to W. F. Steele on settlement with him. He has taken the insolvent oath, and his schedule shows that he owes $4724 19/100 more than is due to him; And there is record evidence in this Court that a part of this is due for money which he collected in Georgia and never paid over to his clients being the very same on which he was imprisoned when he took the benefit of the insolvent Act.
The Costs in the lists forwarded are only Clerk's Costs in the several
<pb#114/>
suits and you will please inform me if there is any thing erroneous in the manner of filling up the blanks. I was some what at a loss from not being acquainted with all of the heads as you will perceive.

Memorial to Congress by Citizens of Jackson County
[November, 1824c)
A Memorial addressed to Congress by the citizens of Jackson County, West Florida.--
Congress having manifested a disposition to remunerate the early settlers in this territory for the toils dangers & privations which they, in common with all who leave the abodes of civilisation to explore &
organise new countries, have experienced, Your Memorialists are emboldened to solicit an extension of the fostering care of Government in their behalf:-They would respectfully state that in the early part of the year 1822 immediately after the expiration of the time appointed by Congress for making donations of land to the first settlers, a great part of your Memorialists removed from the adjacent states to this territory, & that upon them & others who have emigrated subsequently has chiefly devolved the burden of making roads, the trouble of finding markets, the danger of testing climate, the labour of clearing water courses, & in short the arduous task of organising the country.
Under these circumstances your Memorialists, having a considerable stake in this territory, feel alarmed by the consideration of what has transpired in the state of Alabama, & are apprehensive that the fruit of their labours will be reaped by monopolists and speculators; they therefore pray that Congress will afford them the same protection, which on former occasions has been granted to citizens under similar circumstances, against those individuals who possessing an almost unlimited command of funds, prohibit fair competition, take advantage of the improvements of individuals and defraud the general government. Of such abuses your Memorialists would cite an illustration furnished at the sale of the public lands in Alabama, on which occasion, the speculators & money holders actually required the payment of considerable sums of money from citizens whose improved claims bore an honorable testimony to their industry, compelling them to purchase their right of coming into the market, & securing their own interests at the expence of the people and the treasury.—
The immunity which your Memorialists would most respectfully &
earnestly solicit is a pre-emption in favor of their claims & improvements, that they may be shielded from oppression & encouraged to proceed with the cultivation of their claims & the improvement of the country generally.
That Congress may not entertain the opinion that your Memorialists themselves have formed the design of monopolising valuable tracts of lands they would state that no individual has made a claim of more than one thousand acres of land, & that few claims exceed six hundred
& forty acres. Your Memorialists deem it proper to observe that the
<pb#116/>
permission which Congress granted to citizens, to occupy & cultivate the soil for some years prior to the sale of the lands will not prove beneficial to them unless Congress should be pleased to accede to their present petition; the lands in this section of the country require severe labour & cultivation for several years before they come to perfection
& yield a produce that will more than clear the expences of the planter, differing widely in this respect from the neighbouring states of Alabama
& Georgia, many of your memorialists therefore in lieu of being in funds from the cultivation of the lands when they may come into market, will probably have sunk property & will meet with no remuneration whatever for the improvement of the land, & the toils &
privations they have endured, to which it may be added that the difficulty of transporting produce to market from many parts of the country, has hitherto been unsually great—Your Memorialists conceive that they may with the greater propriety request the indulgence which they have suggested, because there are at present no banking establishments in the territory, and consequently no means of meeting upon equal terms, the speculators who connected with the banks in the adjoining states, can command their coffers at pleasure.
The vast disproportion between the good & bad lands in this territory, must of necessity prove the cause of a comparatively thin population & render it a very vulnerable point in time of war, & should the valuable lands become the property of speculators, the population will be doubtless infinitely less dense: with this view of our territorial affairs, General Jackson when governor of Florida encouraged emigration by every means in his power, & our present respected chief magistrate has followed the example.—
The probability that your Memorialists may here as in the state of Alabama, be kept out of the market by monopolists, & the uncertainty of their being able to realise their claims are reflections that tend very much to damp the spirit of enterprise, & to retard the march of civilisation.—
When your Memorialists consider that in the years 1807” & 1808”
Congress granted a preemption to the citizens in the state of Louisiana, giving them the lands at the government price, and also presented a large & valuable tract of land in the state of Alabama to foreigners”
who had not levelled one oak of the forest or turned up one furrow of land, they feel encouraged and can scarcely entertain a doubt that Congress will grant a preemption in favor of citizens who have borne the heat & burden of the day, & who are already identified with the soil.

<dochead>THE LAND COMMISSIONERS (WEST FLORIDA) TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 18 Cong., 2 sess.:LS)</source>
<place-time>Commissioners Office, PENSACOLA, November 13* 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. The Commissioners for ascertaining claims and titles, to land within the District of West Florida, are under the necessity of representing to the Honorable Body over which you preside, their inability to accomplish the objects of their Commission within the period fixed by law for the termination of their Session.*
Aware of the desire of the Goverment of the U. States to have the private land claims of Florida speedily adjusted, the undersigned have devoted their most unremitted attention to that object. In consequence, however, of the accumulated labours of the Board, imposed by an Act of the last Session of Congress,” and the large number of Claims presented since that time, it will be indespensible to grant an extension similar to that given at the last Session of Congress, to complete the whole business properly.
The Commissioners could not forsee or anticipate, the protracted enquiries to which they were subjected in many instances to protect the interest of the U. States and do justice to honest Claimants. But an deeeptive imperfect estimate can be formed from an examination of the Reports which they expect to have the honor to submit at an early period of the approaching Session of Congress. The abstracts of adjudicated claims contain only a Condensed view of the results of tedious and labourous investigation.
It will be recollected that this Board did not Commence its examinations untile September 1823, for causes explained in our former Communication;" About one thousand claims have been presented, many of which are contained in voluminous documents, required by law to be recorded and translated before examination, and afterwards a Statement of the documentary and parol proof taken down in the Record of the “Acts and Proceedings” of the Board. After the performance of this duty, so important to the U. States, and beneficial to the Claimants in perpetuating the evidences and assurances of their titles, the Commissioners are required in all conflicting British and Spanish Claims to make out an Abstract of eaeh the titles of each and report it to the Secretary of the Treasury, under the 4* Section
<pb#127/>
of the law regulating our duties—In addition to the foregoing, about two hundred claims have been presented under the Donation Act, the evidence in support of which, the Undersigned are required to examine record and report. A large number of the Claims under this act were presented by persons residing at the distance of two hundred miles from Pensacola; the Commissioners Conceived it their duty to avail themselves of the permission of helding the act of Congress to hold their Settings in any other part of the District that might be deemed necessary—and accordingly held a Session of two weeks in Jackson County for the accommodation of the Claimants, and to be accessible to witnesses on behalf of the U. States, if necessary to prevent imposition and repulse fraud. They were absent four weeks and have great reason to be satisfied with the Course they thought proper to persue, as it was attended with important results to the Goverment.
So late as the first of September last, about One hundred British Claims were presented; These facts are refered to that Congress may have some adequate idea of the situation of the office, and will demonstrate the utter impracticability of completing the business within the Session.
The Undersigned however, have determined to delay all other proceedings, and report all claims of every description East of Pensacola in West Florida, to the Secretary of the Treasury in next month, leaving the Reports to be recorded from the Original Opinions, & the abstracts from duplicate Copies, and reserving all the unexamined claims in Pensacola & between it and Perdido for subsequent report.
They have been led to the adoption of this Course, that the whole Country between this and Tallahassee, the Seat of Government, about
<pb#128/>
to request such an extension of the Term at an early period of the Session as possible as will be commensurate with the object.”
We have the honor to be, with high Considerations of respect, Your Ob" Servants.

<docbody>SIR, There being no mail route from this place, I avail myself of the first opportunity of informing you by private conveyance to Milledgeville Georgia of my arrival at this place on the 12* ins" and shall be enabled to commence my surveys in the present week.
I found it necessary on leaving Tennessee to appoint two clerks, that I might be enabled to bring them on with me, and finding there would be a necessity for two so soon after my surveys commenced, I was fearful to risk the procuring of one precisely at the period your instructions suggested. I hope you will approve this measure as it
<pb#129/>
was alone dictated for the public good—I have stipulated to give them the same salary as allowed to the Clerks in the Office of General Coffee—Robert W Williams and Isham G. Searcy are the names of the Gentlemen so appointed on the 19* of October last—
Since my arrival I have made enquiry on the subject of the boundary line of the State of Georgia and find that there are two or three lines, and it is supposed that the surveys of that state intrude upon this Territory. I had Occasion to address you on this subject before I
left Tennessee and hoped it may have met your consideration—
When I shall have dispatched my Surveyors I will avail myself of the earliest opportunity of enclosing copies of the several contracts entered into with them—
I detached Mº Williams by S* Stephens “ to procure and bring on the funds for the Draft on the Tombeckbe Bank and so soon as he arrives I shall account to the 1* Auditor for its receipt *—
I have the honor to be, Very respectfully Y. M.” Ob St.

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY LATE SPANISH OFFICERS AND SPANISH INHABITANTS OF THE TERRITORY</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:DS)</source>
<place-time>[November 22, 1824]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the subscribers late Spanish Officers and individual Spanish Inhabitants of Florida, humbly represents that in the year 1814 when a state of Hostilities subsisted between the Governments of Great Britain and the United States of America considerable Detachments of British Troops were from time to time landed upon the Coast of Florida and particularly at Pensacola.-The Spanish Government was too weak to preserve its neutrality as between Great Britain and the United States or to restrain numerous acts of open and public Hostility to which the Indians located within the then Province of Florida were excited by the arts Bribes and persuasions of English Emissaries amongst them. Your Memorialists further represent that this State of things rendered it necessary in the Estimation of the commanding General of the Southern Division of the Army of the United States to march a Force into the Province of Florida sufficient to Dislodge the British Forces from the same and to subdue the Indians. And your Memorialists further represent that in the prosecution of this Design a numerous Army was marched into said province and penetrated as far as Pensacola. That vigilant as was the commanding Officer of said Forces (and your Memorialists here beg leave gratefully to acknowledge his unceasing Watchfulness for the preservation of their persons and their property from Outrage and Violation) many Injuries were yet suffered and many Losses sustained from stragling parties of Militia and rangers.-And your Memorialists further represent that they made repeated applications to the Government of Spain for Compensation for the Losses above mentioned
<pb#131/>
accompanying the same with the Evidence of such Losses—But that the conclusion of the Treaty of 22” Feby 1819 between the United States and his Catholic Majesty found your Memorialists still unremunerated.—When the said Treaty had been ratified and was published your Memorialists supposed and do Beleive their Case provided for by the last Clause of the 9” Article thereof, which it is stipulated that “The United States will cause satisfaction to be made for the Injuries if any which by process of Law shall be established to have been suffered by the Spanish Officers and individual Spanish Inhabitants by the operations of the American Army in Florida.”
Under this impression your Memorialists continued untill it has at length been decided by the Authority created for that purpose by the Government of the United States that the above cited Clause cannot be construed to embrace the Claims of your Memorialists.-
And your Memorialists would humbly represent, that though aware it is sometimes necessary to take private property for public uses in time of War, a well regulated Government will render to the Owners a just Compensation—And your Memorialists beg leave to represent that the Government of the United States did provide “that the Judge of one of their Courts should adjust and decide these Claims” which was accordingly done after the most rigid and persevering investigation, in which the Judge excluded those occasioned by the British.
Your Memorialists would therefore further represent that the Claims forwarded must then be legitimate and have all the Weight of Judicial sanction.—And your Memorialists beg leave to represent that when some years since the North Western Army invaded Lower Canada, they appropriated private property to their pressing Exigences and destroyed individual property—immediately after the conclusion of the War an American Agent (M* Lee) was dispatched to French Town and other places to adjust and pay for all Losses sustained by the operations of the American Army.—And your Memorialists humbly state that this proves the Government of the United States have recognized and practiced the principle even with an Enemy.
Your Memorialists would humbly further represent that as they have by the Treaty and by their continued Residence in Florida become Citizens of the United States they can no longer expect successfully to urge their Claims upon the Government of Spain.-They can therefore hope for Relief from no other source than the beneficence of your honorable body.-

You will after seeing that the instructions carried into effect as given to the acting Sub-agent” and Samuel Garey Esq; for the issues as directed by me, bring on to me the certified returns of the issues including the Back rations, and be at this place by the last of December or earlier if possible, you will be governed by the Instructions given to M* Marsh and Garey. But you will take special care that no more rations issue at S*Johns than 400 daily. If it should become necessary to issue more than one thousand per day, they must be issued at Tampa Bay, as the ration is higher on the S" Johns. Mº
Chaires by the permission of the Secretary of War is to be allowed near 14 cents per-ration at Hamleys Old Store, but only 11% cents at Tampa.
I send you a copy of Mº Chaires's Bond. It will be highly necessary for me to know the precise number of Emigrant Indians who are entitled to draw rations and that information you will give me on your arrival at this place. Funds will be placed in your hands for Special objects when I see you.

3,000$, together with copies of correspondence between you and Col”
Humphrey's, and Maj' Chairs, are received.”
I am satisfied that in authorizing Col" Humphreys, to make the advance above referr'd to, you consulted the public interest, and I
would have no hesitation in approving it, were it not that the act of Congress, approved 31* January 1823," provides that “no advance of public money shall be made in any case whatever,” which puts it
<pb#136/>
wholly out of my power to sanction it. The adjustment of this advance, therefore, will be an affair between yourself and the agent, in which I take for granted there will be no difficulty. You will receive a credit for it when your accounts show that the Cattle for which this sum was paid, have been delivered. I have directed the agent to report himself forthwith to you.
Confiding in your discretion, and in compliance with your request, I have issued a requisition in your favor for $4,500—the amount appropriated to pay for the improvements which the Indians may abandon. You will be particular in its application upon the returns of the Commissioner appointed to value the improvements.
Your plan of providing Canoes for the transportation of the Indians appears judicious. It is no doubt more convenient than would be the cost of horses. It is approved.
You will apportion the annuity among the Indians according to their numbers, giving to the Apalachicolas whatever may, upon this bases, fall to their share.
Since the remittance of the 17* August of 13,500$,” I have issued a requisition on the 11” Sept" for $12,605 50/100," of which you were informed, and which has, I presume, been transmitted by the Treasurer, thus anticipating your demand for funds for the expenses of the Indian Department, and for other purposes.
I have this moment received your letters of 26* Oct' " & 24 Novº,”
together with the estimates for rations for the 1* & 2" quarters.
Your appointments of M* Bellamy to value the property, and of M* Geary to issue the rations in the absence of the agent, are approved, and you will pay M* Geary at the rate of 500$ prannum (the Salary of a sub-agent,) during the time in which he may be employed, and enter it as an item in the expense of issuing the Rations."
Your report of your proceedings so far, is satisfactory."

<docbody>DEAR SIR Yesterday Edgar Macon Esq." United States Attorney moved his Honor Joseph L.

<pb#139/>
M. Macon exhibited to the Judge a letter addressed to him by you, under date of the 14* October last”—which appeared to be in answer to one from him under date of the 21* September:” Mº Macon not having kept a copy of that letter, it becomes necessary for me, so far to trespass on your kindness and friendship, as to request, that you will be pleased to favour me with a copy of Mº Macons letter to you of the 21* September last; and also of any other communication which may have been made to the Department on the subject of my bonds, or of my official conduct or standing—
A copy of the proceedings had before Judge Smith, shall be forwarded to Washington if you request it—and if on examining the testimony you should wish additional or other securities to be given, I assure you, that your wishes shall be promptly complied with—The character & integrity of Judge Smith forbids the supposition that he would approve of securities, that he did not believe responsible for the sum for which they were taken—I stated to the Judge, if there was the least doubt on his mind as to their sufficiency, other sureties should be immediately given; but he declared there was no doubt—I
presume you can have no objection to furnish the copies required;

<docbody>SIR, Your letter of the 14* October,” the receipt of which I
acknowledged in a letter of a private nature, has been acted on.
When I gave the information, which I communicated in a letter of the 21. September last,” I was satisfied that the subject which I
referred to you, did not come particularly under the control of any

department at Washington, and that the act approved 15* May 1820°
did not assign you a jurisdiction over such matters, but as I considered a communication of the kind ought to have been made I selected your department as one I had been in the habit of communicating with, and also with this impression that when the information had been officially given to either of the departments that what I considered necessary, would be required to be enquired into, viz the sufficiency of the sureties to the Bond of the Marshal of E. Florida. On your suggestion, I
referred the question to the Judge. Although it may not be the assigned duty of the District Attornies to take the steps and pursue the course I have done, yet from the remote situation of this district from the seat of government, and what I knew of my own knowledge, respecting the securities and my being the law officer of the government, I considered it incumbent that I should not be silent, and that should it ever be necessary for the United States or individuals to resort to that the bond of our Marshal and it prove insufficient, that I
might justly be censured, for not using some precaution to guard against an event, I had confidently anticipated—When ever I conceive it proper for me, as an officer of government, to act, I will do so, regardless of the responsibility, no matter how great.
The Judge of the district court, has decided that the surities of the Marshal's bond are sufficient, but I feel warranted in my own judgment & opinion and believe are sustained in that of the community, for having taken the steps I have taken in this case. As I made the communication on this subject to your department, it is but respect to you, that I should address you as to the result which has terminated.
I have furnished the Marshal with the date of my letter (of which I did not retain a copy) relative to his bond, in order that he may be enabled to procure a copy thereof if so disposed—
I have the honour, to be Your ob" servant—

<docbody>The Commissioners appointed under the act of the Governor and Council of the Territory of Florida,” will on the first Monday of April next, proceed to sell in the principal square, to the highest bidder, the lots of Tallahassee; the plan of which embraces one hundred and sixty acres of land, and will be submitted on application and on the days of sale, for the information of purchasers. The terms prescribed by said act, are six per cent advance on the cost of
<pb#142/>
each lot; the residue in three equal, annual instalments, and the lots and individual security held bound for the payments, on the completions of which, titles will be made to the respective owners.
Tallahasee is situated about nineteen miles north of St. Marks near three navigable streams, in a fine fertile country, growing sugar cane and sea-island cotton, and watered by never failing stream and fine springs.
Public Buildings.
The Commissioners will be prepared to receive proposals, immediately after the sale of the lots of Tallahassee, for the erection of one wing of the public buildings, to be of durable materials. Persons who may be disposed to undertake a work of considerable importance, would do well to attend. A plan will be submitted for the information of those persons interested, and none need apply, who may not be enabled to give satisfactory security for the faithful performance of his contract.”

Sir, Your letter of the 15 Novº “ has been received and I am happy to hear of your safe arrival at the point of destination, and that you will be able so promptly to proceed to the Survey of the Public lands.
It would I presume be desirable to have a sale in May next, if it should only be for ten Townships, but to do this it will be necessary, in order to give sufficient notice of the time of sale, that I should be advised of the Range in which the Townships proposed for sale lye, & of the Number and position of the Townships The Township plats themselves could be returned to this Office at any time previous to the day of sale, From the Perdido to the Chatahoutchie “ you will cause your
<pb#143/>
Surveys to be connected with those made by Freeman * and Coffee in the stte of Alabama, as all those lands are public lands, it will not be indispensably necessary to confine the Surveys to the line of demarcation, it will be proper to make references to, and note that line on the Township plats, where it varies from the Surveys in Alabama. The circumstances in relation to the line from the junction of Flint river with the Chatahoutche to the head of St Marys River are different, and as the lands claimed on the one side of this line belong to Georgia, more precaution in making the Surveys to this line will be requisite.
I understand that in consequence of some obstacles presenting themselves M. Ellicot * did not actually run this part of the line of demarcation, that having reached the Chatohootchie he went round to the mouth of St Marys and ascended that river to the head, or nearly so, where he formed a Stone monument on the SE side of the Okefinacan * Swamp as designating the head of the main branch of the St Marys river, and the point called for in the Treaty. This point being therefore established under the authority of the United States, who were the proper and conpetant authority so far as respected them and the State of Georgia, it must be taken and considered as one of the fixed points in the boundary line between Georgia
& Florida, whether it may be actually North or South of the true point Or not, The junction of the Flint and Chatachootchie being the other point fixed by the Treaty, you will therefore ascertain the point established by M. Ellicot on St Marys, which I presume can readily be done, as I see it designated on Vignoles map of Florida, from this point a line should be run to the Chatootechie, and thence to the junction of Flint river, from which last point a corrected line should be run to Ellicots monument, which line will be considered by you as the proper boundary line between Florida and Georgia, and up to which you will cause your Surveys to be made.
In the estimates submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury I have asked for an appropriation for the Surveying of one hundred Townships in Florida, exclusive of the private claims, it is uncertain however what amount will be appropriated *
I am &c G. G.
<pb#144/>
P. S. The running of the line from the junction of Flint river with the Chatahootchie to Ellicots monument should be confided to one of your best & most skilful deputies, and any interference with the lines run by special authority of the state of Georgia should be particularly and carefully noted, and information thereof furnished to this Department.

<place-time>Kerville Tomoka Dec. 21. 1824</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I have to report to you my return to this place having failed in accomplishing the object of my Commission *—The day after my departure from hence we encountered most inclement weather, which in conjunction with the innundated character of the country in which we were operating; the uncommon warmth of the season; the badness of the water; and the unavoidable fatigue we were exposed to soon generated disease in my camp which increased to such an alarming degree on my arrival at the Sº Lucie river as to leave me but 3 effective men, a number not even sufficient for the necessary attention to the sick—Finding it therefore impossible to advance; the only alternative left was to retreat by short marches, halting as often as necessary, upon my old blazes—I have thus succeeded in returning my party, with the loss of two buried in the wilderness, to this place—Notwithstanding the distressing circumstances which have thus embarrassed my operations; I have succeeded in marking, in my opinion, the most direct practicable route of a road as far as the St Lucie River and about
% of the distance to Cape Florida if not the whole of the distance contemplated by the act of Congress—The Sº Lucie is unquestionably beyond the ultimate limit of population on the Atlantic border of Florida (excepting such establishments as may be made for the object of wrecking & fishing near the Cape) and from the character of the country far South of any point from which an enemy would attempt hostile operations—Both for military purposes therefore and as a convenience to future Inhabitants on the Atlantic border, the route of a road has been marked to its full extent—I am inclined to the opinion however after a somewhat minute examination of the country that the improvement of the inland navigation as far as the Southern point of Indian River would effect the objects which government have in view by a road, at a much less expense—For Military purposes it would be superior and as a convenience to future settlements on the
<pb#145/>
Atlantic coast of Florida it would be preferable—The only land fit for cultivation is upon the immediate margins of the Rivers, which strictly speaking are inlets from the sea and run parallel with it—The inland navigation would be bringing the means of transportation to the very door of each inhabitant, while the road from the nature of the ground must necessarily be from 1 to 2 miles West of each Settlement—A road could not, from the flat character of the country could not be accomplished without much labor & consequent expence
(without calculating the possible loss of lives from operating in a country unfriendly to those not acclamatized—
The population from the real poverty of the country south of the Moschetto never can be dense, and consequently will not be capable of preserving the road from delapidation after completed—The only expense to be encurred in the Inland navigation, to the extent noted, will be in opening a canal at the Haul over between Indian River &
the Moschetto, the distance of which is represented not to exceed one mile—With these impressions I suggest to your consideration the propriety of first placing in complete repair the old King's road, which has been marked by me as far as Tomoka and may be traced without much difficulty beyond to Smyrna—and secondly that of opening a canal at the Haul over—The first operation may be performed at a comparatively trifling expense—It is already in a tolerable condition;
the old causeways only requiring repair and the small creeks which it crosses to be bridged—These are all of inconsiderable width, averaging perhaps from 25 to 30 feet—I have not the time by this opportunity;
as I am anxious to dispatch my sick to St. Augustine, to furnish you with an estimate of probable cost in detail; but if Soldiers are to be employed in the operation I hesitate not in expressing it as my opinion that with judicious management $5000 will accomplish the object—
As to the 2° operation, The canal at the Haulover, I will report to you after a personal examination of the situation—I have sent to town for a reinforcement of men and the interval I shall employ in making the necessary examination when I will write you on the subject—
In marking the Indian boundary I shall necessarily be compelled to approach within 30 or 40 miles of the point on the Sº Lucie where my recent operations terminated—I contemplate therefore obliquing to that position & continue the route of the road as contemplated, if practicable—From all the information however I have been able to collect; It would seem that the St Lucie is within 30 miles of the most southern point to which a road can be made—Beyond that the Country is cut up by bayous & morasses and so impassible as to compel the Indians to seek the sea sand beach in order to effect a journey to the Cape—These uncertainties however will be ascertained from
<pb#146/>
personal inspection when you will receive a detailed report from me embracing all the objects to which my attention has been directed by your Communication I conclude with reiterating my suggestion as to the propriety of obtaining an appropriation this session of Congress for the road as far as Tomoka or Smyrna—If the Government hereafter should persist in extending it to the Cape (MS. torn] much will have been already performed & the whole operation cannot be accomplished in a single season—The distance from St Augustine to Tomoka 44% miles—
From Tomoka to Spruce Creek 15%
From Spruce Creek to Smyrna 7 about

<docbody>For opening section of road from Pensacola to St. Augustine Flº Capt D. E. Burch asst Q' Master with John Bellamy Joshua Hickman, William Drummond. Abraham Bellamy Senº Francis J Ross and Benjamin Chares.
Articles of agreement made and entered into this 21* day of December 1824, between John Bellamy Joshua Hickman, William Drummond, Abraham Bellamy Sen' and Francis J Ross of Duval county and Benjamin Chaires of St Johns County in the Territory of Florida of the one part, and Capt Dan' E. Burch Asst. Q Master U. S. Army, agent for the United States of America of the other part witnesseth:
ARTICLE1" The said John Bellamy, Joshua Hickman, William Dum-
<pb#147/>
mond, Abraham Bellame, Sen” Francis J. Ross of Duval County, and Benjamin Chaires of St Johns County in the Territory of Florida for and in consideration of the sum of thirteen thousand five hundred dollars, hereafter to be paid to the said John Bellamy or his heirs Executors &" have and do agree to the following conditions for the faithful performance of which they hereby bind themselves their heirs Executors &° jointly and severally in the penal sum of Twenty seven thousand dollars—.
ARTICLE 2" The parties to the first part hereof agree to open and constructaroad from the landing at “Murrays Ferry on the East Bank of the Ocholochony" river to the west Bank of the St. Johns river opposite to Picolata,” in the following manner, to wit.
First. The route for the road is to be confined to the trail marked out by said Burch for a public road under the orders of the War Department in the winter of 1823–24, which route is designated by marked trees thereon, blazed on each side—East and west with a notch under each blaze, no deviation is to be made therefrom exceeding three miles, and then solely with a view to the selection of proper ground for the road and to avoid pondy and marshy places—The road is to be opened in “Reaches” and staked out as strait as practicable, keeping in view the general direction of the road, the ascent and declivities of hills, and other localities of such a nature as to cause necessary deviations from the straight line. The hills in the route of the road when steep are to be cut down and so wound around by the course of the road itself as to reduce as much as practicable the steepness of the ascent, and to render them practicable for carriages or loaded waggons.
Second—The road is to be opened sixteen feet wide through out, and all timber, brushwood, and other rubbish or impediments to be removed from it, any holes that may be in the limits of said road are to be filled up with earth and rammed hard. The stumps are to be cut down as low to the ground as possible, and as much as is practicable hollowed into the centre in cutting them, so as to retain the rain and moisture. All marshy, miry, swampy ground is to be cause-
<pb#148/>
wayed with poles or split timber from 5 to 8 inches in diameter at the least end, laid down compactly side by side across the direction of the road—
The causeways are to be fifteen feet wide, and to be secured at each side with heavy riders firmly and securely staked down. Ditches four feet wide and three deep are to be dug on each side of the causeways, and the earth and sand taken therefrom, thrown up on to them and levelled thereon leaving it convex, or the highest in the centre, and when the swamps or other grounds causewayed are of such a nature that the ditches will not afford sand sufficient to cover the causeways a sufficiency is to be carried on to them dry from other places. At proper intervals in long causeways or through very wet ground, open log ridges are to be constructed therein to let the water, pass through freely. Where any separate causeway shall exceed one hundred yards in length it is to be opened in the centre (or at each distance of a hundred yards as the case may be) to the width of Twenty feet, for a distance of at least forty feet in length All branches, streams, creeks, Lagoons or rivers (excepting the Souwannee River at which a ferry flat is to be built of suitable size,) are to be bridged in the most substantial manner: if such streams &" be less than ten feet wide, with strong and permanent log abutments for the floor beams to rest upon—and if it be more than ten feet wide, with staunch frame bridges built upon trestles or arches none of which are to be more than fourteen feet apart—The main timbers of the bridges are not to be less than twelve by twelve inches squared and hewed and when the length of the uprights are twenty feet in height, measuring from the mud sell to the Cap sill, they are to be fourteen by sixteen inches squared and hewed. The mud sills are to be logs not less than two feet in diameter, hewed on the upper and lower sides, the bark taken off the other two sides, and to extend at least four feet at each end beyond the exterior sides of the up rights. The uprights are to be firmly secured into the mud sills and Cap sills by mortices and tennons with two pins in each, and to be firmly braced with timbers of five inches squared and hewed, with mortices and tennons pinned in like manner. The floor beams of the bridges are to be four in number, one on each side of the bridge resting at each end on the cap sill and immediately over the uprights, and the other two equi distant from the side beams and from each other. The flooring of the frame bridges is to be of sawed plank three inches thick. The other bridges may be covered with split or hewn puncheons of the same thickness. The bridges are to be twelve feet wide in the clear, that is twelve feet wide measuring from the exterior sides of the uprights at the cap sill. These planks or puncheons are
<pb#149/>
to be firmly pinned to the beams at each end. No timber whatever is to be used in the construction of the bridges except “light wood”
or heart of pine, or some other wood known to be equally hard durable and lasting, whether under the water or exposed to the air. The bridges are to be built so high above the water that no part thereof from Bank to bank shall ever be exposed to danger from the effect of the highest freshets. Good and staunch hand rails are to be affixed to the Bridges.

<place-time>Collector's office District of PENSACOLA December 28, 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Herewith enclosed I beg leave respectfully to submit for your information, the Decision of the District Court of West Florida, on the trial of the Schooner Dolce Nombre de Maria, and at the same time have to assure you that nothing was wanted on my part or that of Mr Barkley the Inspector, to effect a condemnation of said vessel &
cargo. At the time I detected Captain Petiton smugling goods from on board said Schooner, I applied at the office of the prosecuting Attorney of the District W* F. Steele Esq. for a process against the Wessel &c, but learned that he had lately left the Territory of Florida, under circumstances which rendered it probable that he would not return; after advising with the best counsel, I though it my duty to employ an attorney to prosecute these suits; and Adam Gorden Esq."
acting then as prosecuting attorney in the County Court of Escambia I employed him to issue the necessary process, and associated with him John Lee Williams Esq. as counsel to make out the pleadings, the suits were instituted accordingly but M* Gorden being called to the seat of Government for the Territory, I advised Mº Williams to employ Col: Jo" M White as assistant counsel, as the Defendants were bringing from Mobile the best Counsel that could be employed.—At the time of trial M* Steele unexpectedly made his appearance, assumed his station in Court as attorney for the United States. and objected to all the process & pleadings unless the name of M* Gorden should be wholely struck out and his own substituted in his stead, he assumed the prerogative of examining all the witnesses in fact he would manage the whole cause in his own way, I submitted his claims to the Court which having only suspended Steele as attorney on the civil side of the Court, and having submitted his conduct to the chief of his Department, the Judge did not see proper to debar him from the exercise of his official Duties without advice from the President of the United States.
he was therefore permitted to controul the proceedings in his own way, and being unacquainted with the testimony and the various facts, on which the mertis of the Cause depended, it was finally lost as it respected the condemnation of the Wessel her tackle apparel &c. &c, and he entered a Nol Prossi in the suit for the penalty of the fine against the Prize Captain, in the face of the most palpable testimony and against the protestations of the assistant counsel and my own wishes; with the conduct of the gentlemen who I employed I am satisfied, and am certain that but for the interference of M" Steele I should have been completely successful in both suits.-

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</dochead>
<source>[NA:SF, 18 Cong., 2 sess.:DS 2)</source>
<place-time>[December 28, 1824]</place-time>
<docbody>To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.
The memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida respectfully represents; That influenced by a confident belief, that the improvement and population of Florida is peculiarly a subject of national concern; That it is all important to the United States to Strengthen a frontier, to which nature has assigned so large a portion of sea coast, and Agricultural resources; we need no additional encouragement to lay before Congress our views in relation to these objects.
Your Memorialists on referring to the characters of the climate soil and topography of this Territory and considering its capacity for producing the orange, the olive and the vine, together with sugar and cotton and the more valuable tropical staples, cannot but lament that these resources should lay dormant and that objects of so much A certified copy of this memorial is also in NA (SF, 18 Cong., 2 sess.), printed in H. Exec. Doc. 36, 18 Cong., 2 sess., Fla. Acts, 1822–1824, pp. 307-310, St.
Augustine E. Fla. Herald, Jan. 25, 1826, and in Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla.
Advertiser, Feb.26, 1826.
<pb#154/>
national wealth should be withheld from the industry and enterprise of the Citizens of the United States.
This condition of the Territory your memorialists ascribe to the delay attendant on the adjustment of the land claims and the want of a legal and settled line of demarcation between public and private property. The planter cannot emigrate to Florida, because he cannot purchase lands with a clear legal title; the old inhabitants of the Territory are suffering under poverty and distress, and there is a general inactivity in Agriculture and a consequent depression in commerce and trade; all of which evils your memorialists are of opinion might in a great measure be removed by the interposition of Congress in terminating or modifying the system of investigating land claims, which seems to have been so ineffectual in producing an adjustment, And your memorialists would suggest whether it would not comport with justice and with the interest of the United States that such of the land claims as may be rejected or undecided by the land commissioners, may at the option of the individuals concerned be carried before the Superior Courts for decision and that Congress in its wisdom might give to the said commissioners such latitude in their operations as might afford more facility to the object of adjustment.
Your memorialists consider as another object of primary importance the opening of a canal across the Peninsula of East Florida from the river Suwaney to St. Johns or between such other points as on examination may prove to be more eligible; Such a canal, by opening a passage from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic would in an eminent degree, develope the agricultural resources of Florida, enhance the value of the public lands, promote the intercourse and enlarge the commerce of the Atlantic and western states and in time of war would give celerity and energy to the operations of the general government;
and it is believed that in no part of the United States could an object of so much public utility be promoted with less difficulty or expenditure, the Peninsula being intersected at various parts by water courses, the connexion of which would render the expense of this work an object of comparative insignificance.
Another subject to which we would call the attention of Congress is the condition of the settlers on public lands; Urged on by a spirit of enterprise which no obstacles or danger could subdue they have during the three preceding years at great expense and loss opened roads and pioneered the way for future settlers, and thus afforded information relative to the resources and topography of a considerable portion of the Territory. Experience has shewn that whatever may be the merits of settlers upon the public lands their interests are never
<pb#155/>
secure against the cupidity of the speculator and it is humbly conceived that a liberal and enlarged policy on the part of the general Government points to the improvement of the public lands, of the Territory as an event whose importance bears no comparison with that of disposing of these lands for a price even greater than that which has ever been heretofore received for public lands in Alabama or elsewhere. Acting under the influence of these views we do not hesitate to impart to the wishes of the people of Florida in this respect the humble sanction of this body, and we would add that the settlers spoken of do not hope for more than pre-emptions of the same lands which they have settled and improved up to as late a period as congress in its beneficence may choose to grant it.
In thus pointing towards objects of public usefulness we would not omit that of education. The endowment of a Territorial University is in the power of Congress and your memorialists have to ask that One or more Townships of the public lands of this Territory be granted for this purpose to be located in the Middle District under the direction of the Governor and Legislative Council—And that the Cities of St. Augustine and Pensacola for the purposes of education and police be endowed with the public lots therein not otherwise appropriated;
these lots although of a value unimportant to the United States could be beneficially applied to the convenience of the inhabitants and to the protection and prosperity of the rising generation.
For the accomplishment of these and all other objects of public utility, Your memorialists unite with their fellow citizens in a reliance On the wisdom of Congress for such assistance and cooperation as may comport with the station which this infant Territory holds in the union.”

<source>[NA:HF, 18 Cong., 2 sess. :LS)</source>
<place-time>NAVY DEPARTMENT December 29* 1824.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In answer to your letter of the 21* inst: " I have the honor to state, that there are no “cases of piratical depredations, or other information on the subject in the possession of the Department, which are not referred to in the Report accompanying the President's Message” to Congress.”—No reports of cases have been received, except those made by Naval Officers, of such as have come, in some way under their own observation.—No memorandum has been kept of the cases detailed in the Public Journals; but some of them have, occasionally, been enclosed to the Commanding Officer of the Station to afford him information in the discharge of his duties.—
In answer to your enquiries, respecting the views of the Department, I enclose Copy of a letter addressed to the Hon” B. W.
Crowninshield, Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs in the House of Representatives, dated the 21* inst: lettered A.” which states the description and amount of Naval force supposed to be proper, as an augmentation of that now employed in the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico.
The “additional means” alluded to, as proper to be entrusted to the Executive, if an efficient co-operation of the local Governments could not be obtained, were, three or four Frigates or Sloops of War, with boats for pursuit of the Pirates;–authority to pursue them, wherever they might attempt to escape; and authority to enforce a rigorous blackade, if other efforts should prove ineffectual.
I have not supposed that it would be expedient to authorise, by law, our Merchant Vessels to arm. Should Congress entertain a different opinion on this point, and pass a law on the subject, it should embrace
“Provisions and restrictions,” similar to those contained in the 3" &
4* Sections of the “Act to authorise the defence of the Merchant Wessels of the United States against French depredations,” passed
25th of June 1798.49–
<pb#157/>
Paper lettered B, herewith communicated,” contains a statement of all the vacancies in the Officers of the Navy, which have occurred since 1819; accompanying which is a copy of the Naval Register for
1824.—
I have not yet received any accurate information from surveys, made since the last Session of Congress, relating to the advantages of St: Marys, Charleston, and Pensacola, as places of Naval Deposit.—
The results of those which have been ordered cannot be expected before the end of this Session of Congress.-
In the mean time from maps, charts, and surveys formerly made by the U. S. Engineers, and Naval Officers, I feel authorized to express the following opinions.—
Although there is deeper water, at St Mary's, yet it has less advantages than Charleston as a place for slight repairs, and occasional, or permanent deposit, to meet the wants of our smaller Wessels, employed in the West IndiaSeas, and on the Atlantic Coast of the Southern States.—They may occasionally rendezvous with advantage at the latter place.—
Pensacola is entitled to a decided preference over every other port in the Gulf of Mexico, as a place of general deposit for Naval Stores, and of rendezvous for our Wessels which may be employed in that quarter.—The enclosed paper lettered C,” affords the best view of its advantages, which can, at this time, be presented.—It was written in answer to enquiries made by me of the Engineer Department.—I
would respectfully suggest, however, that it ought not to be published, but after being used for the information of the Committee and the Senate, be returned to this Department.—
The necessity of having some place in the Gulf of Mexico, to which our Vessels can resort for Stores, and ordinary repairs; becomes every day greater.—The immense interests, connected with the Mississippi, and other waters which fall into the Gulf, and our increasing Commerce, in that quarter, arising from the growing wealth and population of the West and South West portions of our Union, demand and must receive additional care and attention.—This will require that our Wessels should remain more permanently there and should not be obliged to return to the Middle or, North of the United States, whenever they need repairs, or stores.—Pensacola is believed to be the only place where provision can be made to supply their wants.-I would respectfully suggest however, that it would not be prudent at this time for Congress to locate either a Navy Yard or Depot, in the Gulf of Mexico;-but that power should be entrusted to the Department, 11 Not present.
<pb#158/>
to select the place, and an appropriation of $100,000, be made, to meet the expenses incident to the purchase of a site, and erection of the necessary Store houses. This course is suggested because the Department will be better able, after further surveys and examinations by competent officers, to locate prudently, and purchase economically.—
What sum of money will be eventually necessary to complete the establishment, it is imposssible now to estimate with accuracy.—The sum mentioned, is supposed sufficient, to buy the land, and to make such buildings as present necessities may require.—It is possible that a less sum will be sufficient for the present year.—
I have the honor to be Very respectfully Your obedt: Servt:

The Mails.-For three weeks past we have been disappointed with regard to the mails; two of the three which came last, brought us far short of the usual supplies of papers, and by the last we have received but a single paper from the North. These repeated failures cannot be accounted for, and we hope the same cause of complaint may not exist long.

GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 25* November.” In my communication from Tallahassee I
anticipated your present order by furnishing an Estimate of the additional Sum required to complete the Road.” I must now receive the proposals at St. Augustine but will, if I can consistently with them and my promises which I would on no account evade, defer closing the contract until I am further advised by you on the subject of an appropriation or my expenditures on account of the Road.-
<pb#169/>
I enclose herewith my receipt for $.5000.” This amount does not enable me to replace what had been taken from the Road funds for the November disbursements in the Quarter Master's Department;
In addition to which I have expended near $.5000 more to close the last quarter. I beg leave therefore to request you will please to remit me $.5000 to close my accounts for that quarter, (if it should not have been remitted before the receipt of this letter,) so as to meet me in Pensacola on my return from St. Augustine which will be about the
20* February. I am very desirous too to have the funds on my Estimate for the 1* Quarter of 1825 at Pensacola by the first of April at farthest, and without which I shall be unable to close my accounts for that Quarter and meet my engagements, with honor, to the Contractors for the Road, to whom I shall have to pay $.8000 by the 20°

<docbody>SIR, I had the honor of mentioning to you, at Washington, that, after my arrival here, I should, probably, forward to you a report on the state of the country.
I found that the public measures here had been modelled, according to my conception, with such sound judgment, and with such resolution and foresight, as to render unnecessary a farther prosecution of that intention.
For these felicitous results our country is, principally, indebted to the talents, the activity, and the integrity of the Governor, William P.
Duval; and it is due to that candor, with which I would wish to conduct myself toward all mankind, not to withhold my humble testimonial to his merits.”
I have the honor to be, Sir, with high respect, your obedient servant, A. B. WOODWARD.

<place-time>CANTONMENT BROOKE Hillsborough Bay 9" January 1825</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I have this day returned from the Survey of the road to the Santaffy river.” where I have intersected Capt Burch" Trail leading from Pensacola to St Augustine—I have Chained and marked the Road through, I find the distance one hundred & forty two miles—
The Rout I have taken is very direct and I am satisfied it is the nearest and most practicable rout to intersect that Trail that Could have been taken—The Country from this to Chickuchaty. forty one miles, is generally low and covered with Ponds and Cypress Swamps, which renders it impossible to Select dry Ground for a Road the whole distance. Many places will require Causeways and Several Small Bridges, the only Considerable Stream is Alligater Creek
<pb#172/>
Sixteen Miles from this. This Stream is about twenty yards in width, I found the banks Sufficiently high for a Bridge to Stand above high water Mark, The other Small Creeks are fordable at all Seasons—
From Chickuchaty, I struck a high Pine ridge, and followed it thirty five Miles to the Amaxura River.” Below the Forks I found this Stream about Sixty Yards in width, very deep, and in many places rapid I examined the Stream for some distance but Could find no place where a bridge will rest with any Security, a ferry will be necessary, the banks are very low for some distance back from the Stream on one side—It is navigable for Boats of forty Tons for some distance above where I crossed it, Small Wessels Can run up to the mouth of the river at Key Anchlote, with the Supplies necessary for Opening the Road, and taken from the Wessel into Barges up to the Point where the road Crosses, where a deposit should be made—
Three Miles from the Amaxura I crossed Spring Branch, a Stream about Sixty Yards in width fordable (as my Guide informs me) at all Seasons the general depth of the Stream about four feet a firm rocky bottom—This Stream is produced from a large Spring which rises in the long Swamp, and empties into the Amaxura about ten miles below where I crossed it—I do not find it laid down upon any Chart, The Country between the two Streams is low, but firm hard ground for a road.
From Spring Branch I rose a dry Pine ridge, and followed it sixty three miles to Santaffy natural Bridge, where I intersected Capt Burch" Trail leading to St. Augustine—I deemed it unnecessary to follow that Trail to the Suwannee River, as it has been already chained and marked out, The distance from where I Struck the Trail to Suwannee, is forty Miles, and forty five to the St Johns River.
There is a very great sameness in all the Country from Chickuchaty to the Santaffy, Five Miles north of Chickuchaty I passed through the large Hammock as it is Called, apparently very good Soil, the Timber Oak, Hickory, Ash, Bay &". From that to the Santaffy it is generally dry Pine Land, on the right and left of the road Cypress Swamps, and Ponds occasionally. From Cantonment Brooke to Chickuchaty it is generally a Champaign Country low and wet—
Four miles South of Chickuchaty I passed through a Hammock three fourths of a Mile, apparently good Soil, I passed no Indian Towns or Settlements except Chickuchaty, this Town Contains about fifty Souls they Cultivate a small field but produce very little Corn, I
could obtain nothing from them—
I found it necessary to Pack Supplies the whole distance, nothing Could be obtained on the rout., I marked the road through built a
<pb#173/>
raft Crossed the Amaxura, and arrived at Santaffy in nine days, remained two days to rest the men and mules, and returned in seven to this place—A detailed Estimate of the probable Amount of funds required to Complete the road Accompanies this report *—

<place-time>NAVY DEPARTMENT 10 January 1825, HON. JAMES LLOYD Chairman of Naval Comm” In Senate, SIR, In answer to the questions contained in your letter of the 7.</place-time>
<docbody>Instant,” I have the honor to state—
1*. The report of the 4* Auditor,” enclosed herewith, shews the amount already expended at Thompsons Island, so far as the accounts are yet settled at the Treasury Department.
2. The original instructions to Commodore Porter,” and now in possession of the Commodore, and the reports from this Department to the President of the United States, at the beginning of the last and present Session of Congress,” shew the light in which the Department, has viewed it as a place of Rendezvous and depot of supplies for our vessels, engaged in the suppression of Piracy. It was originally Selected, has heretofore been used, and is now proposed to be continued, for those purposes, to avoid a return to the United States when stores are necessary, which would consume a great portion of the time of our Small vessels, and render them useless. It has never been used, for other objects, without great expense, nor can it hereafter be used. How far it is Susceptible of military defences so as to make it a valuable position in a period of war, I am not prepared to say. This can only be determined, by the examination of competent engineers.
<pb#174/>
3" The only improvements which have been made, are small buildings for the accommodation of Stores, and to Serve as Hospitals for the Sick. Those now proposed are for the same objects—and clearing and draining the land to render it more salubrious. The estimates state the Sum Supposed to be necessary for the purpose.
4, The Navy Yard and Depot proposed to be established at Pensacola, or other proper place, in the Gulf of Mexico, will in part, supercede that at Thompsons Island. As a Navy yard it cannot affect it.
As a Depot it will be resorted to by the vessels which cruise in the gulf, more conveniently to it, than to Thompsons Island. The extent of the effect upon the latter, will depend much on the size of the vessels used. If they are Small Schooners &" to cruise as far to windward as St Thomas, and to leward as the Bay of Campeachy, and to receive their supplies from Pensacola or Charleston, one third at least of their time, 20 in every 60 days will be consumed in that operation, and be lost to the object of their Cruising. If they are obliged to return further North, the loss time will be proportionably greater.
Hence the necessity of the station and Depot at Thompsons Island for our Squadron as at present composed. If they are, barges Schooners, under like circumstances, they will loose 20 out of 100 days. If frigates or Sloops of war, about 20 out of 180 days. From this Statement, inferences will be drawn on two points, 1" as to the character of the force most economical and best suited for that purpose.
2 How far provision should be made to Supercede Thompsons Island as a Naval Depot. There are, however, other considerations connected with the latter place, which ought not to be overlooked. Its proximity to the limits of our union in that quarter—to the possessions of other powers—to the scenes of piratical and other injuries to commerce—and to the usual track of vessels to and from so many ports, renders it difficult, if not impossible altogether to abandon it. And if not abandoned some improvements are necessary—
5. The whole of the Coast of Florida has not been surveyed by us, but we have Spanish and other charts and maps, of the whole coast, which have been found accurate as far as our surveys have extended.
And from them I feel justified in saying that there is no inlet or Harbor having a deeper draught of water than Pensacola.”
I am Respectfully &"

<place-time>CANTONMENT BROOKE 11" January 1825</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith an estimate of the probable amount of funds necessary for opening the road to the Santaffy River, to intersect the road, marked out by Cap" Burch from Pensacola to St. Augustine; *
This estimate is founded upon the belief that the road will be opened by the Troops. The road from this to Chichuchaty, will require several small bridges, and causeways, beyond that nothing is required but to remove the Timber, the Country undulating pine lands, until it reaches the Amaxura, and beyond that to the Santaffy the Same, The greatest expense will be in transporting the supplies, necessary for the Troops Teams &c. For opening the road to Chichuchaty the supplies, must be taken from this place either on Mules, or waggons, beyond that they can be taken from Pensacola in the Public Transport, to Anchlote Keys the Mouth of the Amaxura, and in barges from that to the point where the road crosses the river, I think there will be no difficulty in getting some person to establish a Ferry at the River, as it is a very good grazing Country for Cattle, on both banks, and a Small Hammock of good land, a short distance from where the road will cross.
I regret the Season was so far advanced when I received the Order for the detail to accompany me, The Winter rains have commenced, I shall find it very difficult to complete the Survey South, The Indians, and Spanish Fishermen, inform me the Country is very low and covered with Cypress swamps, which during the rainy season are impassable for pack Horses, I shall be detained a few days waiting the arrival of the public Transport to take supplies and meet me at Charlotte Harbour, so Soon as she arrives I shall proceed South and complete the Survey if practicable.”

Sº AUGUSTINE, 1* Jany 1825.
CAPT" D. E. BURCH, Ass" Q Master—
SIR-We, the subscribers, having understood that a bridge, as a part of the road to be constructed from Pensacola to this city, and placed in your charge, is to be built across Sº Sabastian's Creek; and that it is intended to erect that bridge at the place called the Estacada;
we beg leave to call your attention to the advantages that will arise from that bridge crossing this creek at the place known by the name of Pepino's Ferry.
Sº Sabastian's Creek runs parallel with this city on the west, and close by; Pepino's Ferry lies abrest of the midway part of this city, about a quarter of a mile distant; the Estacada is to the north, two miles from its northern extremity.
The distance in making the road from Picolata, on S' John's River, by the way of Pepinos Ferry, would not be greater than by the Estacada, the ground at least as good. The travel to town from any part of Sº John's River between Picolata and the bar, an extent of seventy miles, would be the same by the one as by the other place. But from above Picolata, and from along the eastern sea-board south of this city, which is to contain the most dense population of this Territory, the distance would be shortened to travellers from one to four miles by the way of Pepino's Ferry than by the Estacada. The bridge at the former place will afford the inhabitants of Sº Augustine a very desirable recreation, of which they would be debared by the distance and difference of situation at the latter.
<pb#178/>
The bridge at Pepino's Ferry will not be of greater length, and much less causewaying at its approaches will be required, than at the Estacada.”

SIR, I arrived here with the Barges after a close examination of the coast, but have heard of no pirates or piracies. I shall continue my course to leeward, and then proceed to Thompson's Island.
The non arrival of the Fox with the surveying officers has prevented my executing any part of your orders respecting the survey of Pensacola and Tampa Bays,” or any part of the Resolution which gave rise to it, except examining the Dry Tortugas, which I find totally unfit for any kind of naval establishment. They consist of small sand Islands a little above the surface of the Ocean, on some of which is some low shrubbery, but are all liable to change from gales of wind.

The importance of the early promulgation of the laws of the United States at this place will appear from its situation in the midst of a fertile country, far removed from the cities in the extremes of the Territory, and from the fact, that this is the residence of most of the officers of government, connected with this Territory.”
We have the honour to be your obedient servants GORDON CRANE & CO.

D* SIR, I arrived here on the 15* inst. after a tedious passage of eight days from Sº Marks. –The goods were landed in fine order, and are safely stored in care of M* Marsh.”—I have procured the loan of one ox-team, and hired a party of discharged Soldiers, and one or two Indian Negroes to open a road to the Agency; * which I hope to complete as early as the middle of February: by the end of which month, I doubt not, to have the Annuity Articles ready on the spot for delivery, as I shall move from here, with one load, in the Course of six days.-I have already dispatched Runners, appointing the 1*
of March, for the Indians to meet and receive them.—But few emigrants have yet arrived in this quarter: one entire town however
(the Waka-sassa) has reached a point near Chickachatty, and made a location: Chefixico Hajo, who it was said at S*Marks had stopped near Oscilla, had (I am informed by one of his people, who is sent in advance to make arraignments) crossed the Suanny by the first of the Month: if this be true, he may be expected here daily.—I send herewith enclosed, the notes of Lieut: Yancey,” adverted to, in my letter of the 1* inst:" they were brought from Tallahasse by mistake.
I cannot but indulge the hope, that I shall shortly hear from you favourably, in regard to the extension of the Northern Indian Boundary: a matter of the greatest moment, not only to the Indians, but to the U. States: an early communication upon this subject, is highly important, as without it, I cannot make the necessary arraignments for Building, and the Season is at hand, when preparations should be entered into, for making Crops at the Agency, wherever it may be finally located.”
I take the liberty here, to urge upon your attention the vast importance of the adoption of some regulations, by which the trade of the Indians, can be confined within their Territory: without this, to
<pb#182/>
introduce Civilization, and good order among them, or to Controul them in any benificial degree, would be next to impossible. The facility for indulging in their fondness for intoxication, and its Concomitant habits of degeneracy, which a traffic with the White people residing without the Indian Boundary (many of whom feel under no moral, or legal restraint, and are wholly regardless of the evils they produce) affords: give them an entire aversion to Industry and renders the introduction of Agriculture, to any valuable extent among them, a work of Impracticability.—Such is unfortunately the infirmity of the Indian Character (with few exceptions) that when they Can by transporting their articles of Commerce a four or five days journey, obtain in exchange for them, Rum or other Intoxicating liquor, they will do it, and even Sell their Skins &" for a smaller price, than they could get from the licence'd trader in the Nation; who is not permitted to vend to them Spirits; to procure which, is the only inducement they have to carry their trade elsewhere; in addition to the baneful effect, which is thus produced upon the Indians; the trader who relies upon the protection of his Government, after incurring great expence, suffering much inconvenience and privation, is deprived of an important portion of that business, which is his rightful due I may be allowed to suggest, that justice, the interests of the Government and a regard for the happiness of the Indians, call loudly for some Corrective for this extensive evils, and I have a pleasure in adding, that knowing how much and properly, you feel in relation to the Indian affairs of the Territory; I am fully assured, you will endeavour to effect all that is required.
I am with the highest respect your Obt Servt.

<pb#183/>
the names of the Persons who had been compensated by the British Government for Lands claimed in Florida, before the cession of that Country by the Spanish Government; and I am sorry that these communications should be of a nature to prove so little satisfactory to the object of your enquiry.
From a Letter of Gen' Wives, Governor and Captain General of the Island of Cuba, to Mº Thomas Randall, our Agent at Havanna, dated 26* of October last,” in answer to an application of Mr Randall for the papers interesting to persons claiming titles to Land in Florida,”
including the Proclamations, likewise referred to in your note, it would seem, that there is little or no prospect of obtaining them from that quarter, General Wives stating in that Letter, that the search which he had caused to be made for the documents in question was entirely fruitless.

<docbody>DEAR SIR Not having the honour of a personal acquaintance with any member of the Senate of the United States; We have taken the liberty of directing to you, (as representing our native State) the enclosed memorial; requesting that you will be so kind as to present it to the Senate—
The Gentlemen of our Bar are generally of opinion, that the Legislative Council have no authority to interfere with the officers of a Court, established by Congress; and have recommended the course which we have adopted; but on this subject you will not require the opinion of others; We merely mention this fact to account for the request made in our memorial “That Congress will enact that the Marshals shall be the only executive officers of the Superior Courts in this Territory.”—
As a Counsellor at Law, you will no doubt be aware, that much inconvenience, delay and embarrassment, must necessarily result from there being several executive officers to the same Court, each being independent of the other, and the jurisdiction of many extending over a small portion of the Judicial district—
<pb#184/>
If our opinion should be correct, We feel a confidence, that you will advocate the prayer of our Petition, and confer a favour on Sir Your obed". Hum" Servt.

Petition to Congress by Waters Smith and John M. Hanson
|January 25, 1825)
To The Honourable the Senate amd House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled—
The Petition of Waters Smith Marshal for East Florida, and John M. Hanson Marshal for the middle district of Florida Respectfully sheweth—
That your memorialists have been appointed by the President of the United States Marshals for Florida; That by the act of Congress of 26" May 1824 it is provided, that the Marshals “shall be subject to such regulations and penalties as the Legislative Council shall impose while acting under and in virtue of the territorial laws” ”
Your memorialists know of no other authority given by Congress, to the Legislative Council, by which they can interfere with the duties of the Marshals; Your Memorialists are of opinion, that the Legislative Council have exceeded their authority by appointing executive officers to the Superiour Courts of this Territory: That by an act of the Legislative Council, passed 15" December last, it is provided, that
“all business confided to the Marshals of this Territory, shall be transferred to the Sheriffs of the respective Counties in which the business belongs” “ this act, if carried into effect, will deprive your memorialists of almost the whole emoluments of their offices—Your Memorialists therefore pray, that your honourable body will be pleased to enact, that the Marshals shall be the only executive officers of the Superior Courts in this Territory; or if it was the intention of
<pb#185/>
Congress, that the Legislative Council should have authority to make their Sheriffs the executive officers of the Superior Courts; that you will be pleased in that case; to allow such salery to the Marshals as shall be deemed just and proper And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray"—

At the May term of the Superiour court of East Florida, in 1824, Judge Smith established a number of rules for the government of the practice of his court; by which provision is made for the transacting and doing of much business in vacation, which previously had been done in term; viz such as making orders for commissions to take foreign testimony, & hearing and deciding on motions for amending pleadings &c, and other matters and questions generally arising in the usual progress of a suit. For all which services when performed, Judge Smith has charged fees, I have paid them, and I believe every attorney of his (Judge Smith) court, has done the same, It is proper to mention that in United States and territorial cases, Judge Smith has never charged fees,”

<docbody>TO THE HON. THE SECRETARY OF STATE
SIR,-A sense of duty, and as the only present means of remedying the evil which now exists, I enclose you the following note from avery worthy and patriotic member of the late Council of this Territory.
The laws of the Territory it is understood has undergone a general revision, and all the former laws relating to the judiciary, it is understood, have been repealed and new ones relating to that subject enacted; but there is no means of procuring copies thereof, unless from Washington, where, it is known, they have been transmitted by the Governor. Mr. Mitchel informed me verbally, that he endeavoured to have a copy forwarded to the printer here but he could not succeed.
In the uncertain state in which we are, I submit, for the consideration of the department whether it would not be beneficial to the public welfare to cause a transcript to be made and forwarded to me, for publication in my paper se that There is no intercourse between this and Tallahassee, which makes it impossible to procure a manuscript copy of the laws from there.
Much needs to be done to ehferee produce a vigorous execution of the laws, and great energy and discretion is required in our public officers. Men of patriotism and devotion to their country's good would soon bring Florida into notice and cultivation, by which means the country would be enriched with its staples.

MR. GOULD
In answer to your enquiries respecting the publication of the laws of the Territory, I have to state that the Governor informed me that he had contracted for the publication of them at Tallahassee, at a price, to be determined by the Custom in other States, and as I supposed the publication would be delayed in consequence of the in-
<pb#190/>
efficiency of the press in that place, I enqui- of the Printer as to the time when he supposed the publication would be compleated, but to this I obtained no satisfactory answer—On further enquiry of a Gen”
who had once been a Printer, he informed me that he did not think that the laws, under that arrangement, could be published in less than
10 a 12 months—In the absence therefore of better data I cannot give you an opinion which can be relied upon as very correct, but from what I have stated and the observations I have heard at Tallahassee, I do not think that the laws will be published under Four or five months, unless some arrangement be made, other than what I understand to exist at Tallahassee " I am Yr obt Servt PETER MITCHEL

I will also build a bridge over the Lagoon to the Island and causeway said Island to low water mark and on the other side of the river causeway it in like manner, continuing the said road into the City from thence over the small creek, for the additional sum of fifteen hundred dollars; but it is to be understood that the main River is not to be bridged.—</place-time>
<docbody>It is now the wet season and upon a recent examination of this part of the Road, I am convinced that the above sum of fifteen hundred dollars is too low by one half at least for bringing the Road either by the way of the Red house branch or to Wiel's ferry, both of which routes I consider nearly the same labor, and I would not now undertake either for less than the sum of three thousand dollars but having first made you a proposal for the whole route from Ockolockoney to St:
Augustine supposing it would go into St: Augustine by the four mile branch for fifteen thousand dollars and having already closed the contract from Ockolockony to St: John's for thirteen thousand five hundred dollars it has become a point of honor with me to keep good my engagement to you by now continuing the road as I first proposed for the Sum of fifteen hundred dollars although I must sink money by So doing.—

<docbody>SIR, Your proposals of yesterday's date are received. Some communications have taken place between myself & the City authorities of St: Augustine which may occasion a change both in the manner of making the Road & its direction from Picolata, for which reason I
must at present decline accepting your proposal therefor; you are consequently wholly released from any obligation whatever to continue it in effect on your part. But as I am about to refer the subject to the Quarter Master General I request you to inform me, so soon as convenient, whether, in the event of my being instructed to cause the Road to be opened from Picolata to St: Augustine either by the way of the “Red house & four mile branch” or by “Wiel's Ferry,”
you still wish your offers to be taken up. Your offers to open it by either of the routes named therein are lower than any others made to me, and being reasonable will in that case be accepted as a matter of COurSe...—
Your proposal to open the Road & build the Bridge conjointly is also lower than any other I have received & will be accepted in
<pb#194/>
case I am instructed to have the Bridge built at or near Pepino's ferry, but I have at present no authority to decide on this proposal
& therefore wish to be informed whether your offer is, under any circumstances, to be considered as binding upon you hereafter.

<docbody>SIR, In consequence of your letter I consider my proposal for making the road as relinquished, I cannot hereafter be in a situation to undertake the work to so much advantage; It would have been a losing business at any rate especially by the four mile branch.-
My proposal for making the road and Bridge jointly is to remain in force, and if there should not be funds to meet the expense I will undertake to complete it without delay, on condition that I be paid for the Road, say $ 4500, leaving the remainder $.5500. for building the Bridge, to be paid for when funds are appropriated. I shall expect however in that case your assurance that every proper representation shall be made through your Department to obtain the appropriation at the next session of Congress.—
If the Road is made by the way of Pepino's with a view to the establishment of a ferry I will agree to make it for $.4000, as proposed in my letter of the 9", and if with a view to a bridge for $.4500, some more work being necessary to fix the causeway at the ends of the Bridge than for a ferry.*
If it crosses at any point within 400 yds, above the stockades I will make the Road and build the Bridge for $.8000. And if it goes into Town by the way of the Red house and four mile branch I shall ask four thousand five hundred dollars.”—

<docbody>Dr SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 20th Decemb" last.”
You will have received long Since the diagram of the Townships intended for the first Sale,” having forwarded it in December—The Surveys agreeably to that diagram are Completed with the exception of Township 1 Range 5, South and East, which has been found an impassable Swamp at this Season, owing to the high waters and perhaps affording much of the water which makes the Oscilla—Three large Lakes have been Meandered; and in the one Called Hiamonia there has been Surveyed 40 Islands of various Sizes, the largest between 1 and 2 hundred Acres, and the land generally of excellent quality, Surrounded by a Sheet of Clear living water—The protractions and Calculations of the fractional Sections bounding on those Lakes will be a Serious undertaking, being So extremely irregular—I
had Contemplated at one time of having these Lakes Surveyed in Accordance with the plat furnished by your directions, but I find it inexpedient to do So, for the reason above mentioned, as it would cut up the adjoining Sections without any Salutary effect.
There remains a few fractional Sections on the Ockolockonny river to Complete in their meanders which could not be effected heretofore from high waters Since the arrival of the Stationary from New Orleans we have been engaged assiduously and Shall be enabled to forward by the Middle of Next Month the returns of the 23 Townships I shall this day despatch a Surveyor of great experience to run the Boundary line as directed by your letter,” and I would Suggest for your Consideration the reservation from Sale of all the fractions made by my Surveys on the line run by the State of Georgia, with a view to their extention to the true line, which I apprehend will be the fact.
<pb#197/>
To facilitate that work, and to Accommodate the Surveyor Selected, I have deemed it expedient to vary from your instructions by Commencing the traverse line at the Junction of the Flint and Chatahoochie, as by this arrangement he will be Saved about 150 miles of unnecessary travelling in going to and returning from Ellicots monument. My Surveyor Sent East, touched the Atlantic 169. Miles and Some chains, running through Talbots Island and Long Island.”
I have given my instructions to close the Surveys West to the Alabama Surveys as directed by you.
I am about to despatch a Surveyor to run a Meredian down the Cape of Florida, as Soon as practicable to the Sº Johns river on the west with a view of facilitating my Surveys the Succeeding Year.”
The Indian who will take this to Fort Mitchell is now waiting. I
must therefore close this Communication, with a tender of my best respects ROBERT BUTLER

<docbody>HoN. GEORGE GRAHAM Comm' of the G L. Office SIR Refering to the law entitled “An Act providing for a grant of land for the Seat of Government in the Territory of Florida and for Other purposes”. Approved the 24" of May 1824,” it appears to be my duty to point out and designate the three quarter Sections contemplated in the third Section of said Act.
This duty I now proceed to discharge, and desire you respectfully to govern yourself accordingly—Tallahassee is situated on the South East Quarter of Section 36 in Township 1 Range 1 North and West, * The basis parallel east of the Tallahassee principal meridian was run in the fourth quarter of 1824 and the first quarter of 1825 by Christopher C. Stone, a deputy surveyor who had formerly worked in the Territory of Alabama. The basis parallel west was surveyed by Benjamin Clements, who had also been a deputy surveyor in the Territory of Alabama, in the fourth quarter of 1824 (Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, Field Notes, Fla., Bk. 1).
<pb#198/>
Which is bounded on the north, by the north East quarter of Said Section—On the East by the South West Quarter” of Section 31 in Township 1 Range 1 N & E And on the South by the North East quarter” of Section Nº. 1 Township 1 R 1 South & West of the Basis parallel and meridian.
In the exercise of my functions as Acting Governor I have Selected the quarter above described that is, the quarter Sections on the North, East, & South as the reservation Authorized by Said Act I have the honor to be very respectfully yours &c GEO. WALTON

<docbody>SIR. Being about to make with another Gen' a merchantile establishment at Tallehassee I find that some liberty to use one of the public buildings at Fort S*Marks becomes indispensable, I have made some enquiry and find the Fort and buildings to be in possession of a person who is unauthorised from his instructions to give any such privilege, We would be willing to pay an equevolent rent, and become responsible for any damage, or come under any obligation which may be prescribed, As the thing now stands the whole is public property there is no other place of Landing goods and the person in possession will neither give liberty to use a Ware house or to build one. Should it be consistant with the rules and regulations of your department to grant such a privilege I would feel under many obligations for it.”
I hope Sir that you will pardon the liberty which I have taken and would have availed myself of the agency of one of the members of Congress but fear they will have adjourned 'ere this reaches your City.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to report that I have chained and marked the road through to Charlotte Harbour, distance one hundred and twenty seven miles—Previous to leaving this, I made arrangements for the U States Transport to meet me with supplies at that place, On my arrival at the Harbour I found she had not reached there, I
remained two days waiting her arrival, she did not come in, I found I had to run up Charlotte River some distance before I could Cross my Horses I left the Harbour, run up sixty miles before I could find a place sufficiently low to cross, I frequently penetrated the Hammocks and Cypress Swamps but always found banks from ten to fifteen feet high & rocky rotten lime stone—I crossed about three miles below the junction of the two branches, finding the Country Very Swampy and wet, I run out twelve miles from the river, but
<pb#200/>
found it still worse, My men and Horses wadeing through Swamps and Ponds up to their middles I was forced to turn back and follow the river down to the Harbour. wading and Swiming Creeks and Swamps the whole distance—On my arrival on the South Side of the Harbour, I found the Beach for Several Miles back from the Harbour, impassible for Horses—I took one of my men and waded through Swamps and Bayous from three to four feet in depth for three hours before I could reach any point in the Harbour where I could ascertain whether the Vessel had come in, I at length reached the Point opposite the Island on which there is a Spanish fishery—I succeeded in getting them to me with a Perougue—I Visited the Island found the vessel had not come in my supplies being exausted, no game in the Country, no Settlements South either Indians or whites, where Supplies could be obtained, several of my men very lame, from wading through Swamps Creeks and Ponds for near ten days, and no Grass for my Horses, they had become very feeble, I procured from the fishery by entreaty and threats one hundred pounds of hard biscuit (very bad) Some Salt fish And a Small Hog, and from an Indian I obtained some dried venison in all about four days rations for the party—I could obtain no information of the Country South every one declared they knew nothing of the Country, Some Indians had been through during the dry season, but represented it as entirely impracticable to go throgh with Horses—Finding I had but five days provisions, and it was very uncertain whether the vessel would find her way into the Harbour I procured two Perougues with some Spaniards and run up the River about five miles, and floated my Horses and mules over, where the river was about one and a half miles in width, returned to this place in eight days, men on half rations, one of my Horses broke down near Charlotte river, I was Compelled to leave him—On my return I found the Wessel left here on the first of this month for Charlotte Harbour and has not yet returned, she was to run into the Harbour, deposit her supplies at the fishery—Lt. Collins with a party of men and a boat were to be left with the Supplies, none of the party have been heard of ef. It is feared that they have mistaken Peace river Harbour for Charlotte Harbour, which is about thirty miles North and that they are now waiting my arrival Neither this River or Harbour are laid down upon any Chart, I found Vignoles Map very incorrect—The Country from this to the North East Branch of Manatee River Eighteen and a half Miles is generally low and wet, some rolling Pine Lands—If it is intended
<pb#201/>
to make a good Carriage road many places will require Causeways—
this Stream at ordinary seasons is about fifteen yards in width, banks high, can be bridged, distance from this branch to the main River three fourths of a mile, this Stream is Sixty yards in width banks high Can be bridged, Eight and a half miles from the main branch of the Manatee—I crossed the south branch a deep stream about twenty yards in width the banks low, the Country between the two Streams low and wet innumerable small Creeks Ponds and Cypress Swamps—Forty two & a half miles from this Stream, is Tolockchopco or Peace river a deep rapid Stream about Sixty yards in width, banks low and inundated during the rainy season, a ferry must be established at this river—The Country between the South Branch of the Manatee and this Stream, is generally very Swampy, innumerable Cypress Ponds, many of them impassable with Horses, about ten Miles of the distance is dry Pine Land, some black Jack, and Occasionally some live Oak; After leaving this River, the Country changes there is very little Timber except Dwarf Pine and Cypress Swamps, Ten Miles from the river we reached the big Swamp as it is Called by the Indians—It is properly a Swamp Prarie, there is no Timber for fourteen And a half Miles except on the small Creeks, one near the Centre, the other near the South East Side—this Praire is very wet and in many places difficult for Horses to get through—From that to Charlotte Harbour, a distance of thirty four miles, it may be Considered one Continual Swamp, Country very low and wet a thin growth of Dwarf Pine and Cypress, the soil the whole distance through white sand—The Country the whole extent of the Harbour for some distance back impassible for Horses, low Mangrove Shores, innumerable Bayous and Swamps, There are three fisheries in the Harbour, they are established on the Keys near the Entrance in all forty three Spaniards, and several Indians, The live in Huts Constructed of the Palmetto Similar to the Indians, they appear to be industrious and attend to their Fishery alone *

<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.—
The petition of the Subscribers resident inhabitants of the eastern district of Florida respectfully sheweth That in virtue of the acts of Congress for the establishment of a Territorial government in Florida, a Marshal of the United States has been appointed by the President, as the executive officer of the Superior Court throughout this district—and by an act of the Legislative Council of this Territory approved June 29* 1823 it is declared that the Marshals of the Territory in addition to the duties assigned them by the laws of the United States shall be the executive officers of the Territorial branch of the Superior Courts within their respective districts;" that the present Marshal for this District, has in virtue of the aforesaid acts of Congress, and the declaritory act of the Legislative Council, hitherto discharged all the duties of the executive officer of the said Superior Court in this district, and given great
<pb#205/>
satisfaction in the exercise of his office; that by an act of the Legislative Council at their late session at Tallahasse, the said act of the
29* June 1823 has been repealed, and it has been enacted that “All business confided to the Marshals of this Territory, shall be transferred to the Sheriffs of the respective Counties in which the business belongs”* Your petitioners respectfully represent, that the multiplication of officers to the Superior Court (if the Legislative Council have authority to do so) will be productive of great inconvenience to the inhabitants of this district and occasion much embarrassment in the administration of Justice—The many evils which would result from the operation of this act, to an extensive and thinly populated district are so manifest, that your petitioners deem it unnecessary to enumerate them—but as your petitioners firmly believe that it was intended by the Act of Congress aforesaid, that the Marshals should be the sole executive officers of the Superior Courts, and that the Legislative Council of this Territory have no right to assign the duties thereof to the Sheriffs who are mere county officers—Your Petitioners therefore pray that Congress will pass a declaritory act on this subject—or repeal the act of the Legislative Council passed at their late session *—And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray—

<docbody>GENL R. K. CALL House of Represent SIR I have examined the claims of Fernando Morino, Juan Dominquez, and Philip Prieto, which you left with me a few days ago, & regret that they are yet deficient in the evidence necessary to warrant their payment.—
The first objection stated against those claims in my letter to you of the 26" April last,” may be considered as removed, since the confirmation by Congress, of the titles to the land on which the damages are alleged to have occurred, generally follows as matter of course, on the favorable report of the commissioners. But there is no evidence adduced, tending to remove the other objections stated. It will occur to you as important to be shown, that the damages assessed were in fact committed by the United States troops—that the arbitrators were duly appointed by the claimants & the public agent—and that they acted under the obligation of an oath. If the timber was, as I presume, cut by authority, & under the direction of an officer for building purposes, a certificate to that effect, stating also, that the extent of the depredations thus committed, had been correctly pointed out to the arbitrators on the ground, should be produced. The paper constituting the arbitrators in the cases, & their regular qualifications being then annexed, the claims would be in a fit condition to be paid.
The papers are herewith returned to you—and I would advise you to present them with this letter, to Captain Burch at Pensacola, who will be able to point out the form of proceeding, and who will no doubt pay them himself on the production of the additional evidence

<docbody>SIR!

The land is so poor on each side of the Creek where the Road is to cross, that it would not maintain a family; and whoever therefore undertakes to attend the ferry must be supported at the public expence:—many other considerations might be submitted, but we rest satisfied, that the government will be induced on the score of oeconomy, with a view to the completion of the objects of the Road,—to authorize the construction of a Bridge in the manner suggested by the council to Captain Burch 19–

SIR, The undersigned, the Mayor and Members of the City Council understanding that you consider the establishment of a Bridge over the Sº Sebastian in the vecinity of this city, is not included in the objects of the road about to be constructed between Pensacola and this place; we take the liberty of requesting your attention to the following considerations, which are submitted with due defference to
<pb#208/>
the opinion you have expressed on the subject. We beg leave to suggest, that as the accommodation of Pensacola, and Sº Augustine, and the opening of a free intercourse between these two points, was the leading object of the government, in authorizing the laying out and construction of the road in question, and that therefore the establishment of Bridges in the most convenient situations, and where they are essentially necessary, must form an important portion of the improvement contemplated by the Act of Congress. We would then Sir submit, whether a ferry at the point alluded to, will not contravene the evident object of the Government, in as much as the tolls which must be collected for its support, will prove a perpetual tax on the citizens of this place, and all who visit it, and whether the great high-way about to be formed, should not be completed with an especial view to the accommodation of the cities which it was meant to benefit; and be made the means of an immediate advantage to them. Congress we presume, will not withhold any appropriation necessary for the completion of the essential object which it has so munificently began, but which we conceive will not be completed, but on the contrary must imperfectly terminated by the establishment of an expensive and inconvenient Ferry, when a Bridge which will afford an accommodation, to which the expense of the construction will bear no proportion, can be readily built in its stead.—The navigation will admit of the materials being conveniently floated to the spot, and the labourers necessary for the work, can be readily obtained in the vecinity. The Act of congress being public, and opened to the interpretation of all, we have not hesitated to submit to you the foregoing views, trusting that you will put a liberal construction upon our motives and objects—

<docbody>HONLE. JoHN C. CALHOUN–Secretary of War SIR I request that a requsition may be made on the Treasury of the United States, for the following sums in order to supply the Florida Indians with rations according to the Treaty and in pursuance of the several contracts for this object, returned by me to your Department, The estimate for the first quarter amounts to the sum of
$23:448:25 cents of which sum, $12:605:50 has been remitted, leaving a ballance of $10:842:75. cents due for the first quarter, and the estimate for the second quarter is $15:587:50 cents. no part of which has been remitted—I have accounted for the whole sum remitted for rations & have myself made an advance of $1250. to M. Crupper in Order to procure the voucher up to the time the Indians were removed South. The returns of rations issued to the Indians have been and will continue to be made in strict conformity to the Directions of your Department.

Governor DuVal to the Secretary of War WASHINGTON Feby 29th [?] 1825
HONLE. JoHN C. CALHOUN Secretary of War SIR I request that a requistion may be made on the Treasuary for the amount as estimated, for the first and second quarters, for rations furnished and to be issued to the Florida Indians according to the late Treaty The Drafts can be transmitted to Co" George Walton Acting Governor of Florida—I had made an advance out of my own funds in order to take up the vouchers from Capt. M. Crupper for rations issued to the Indians at St. Marks and which vouchers are now returned to your Department, I expected to draw the amount that might be due me on a settlement of my accounts, but one of my vouchers, for $3540 paid to Benj" Chairs on account of rations actually dilivered to the Agent has been suspended untill the returns shall be made by the Agent, of the issues—This subjects me to serious inconvenience, and, and brings me apparently in debt to the Government, when in fact they owe me about $2,000, under these circumstances I
request that a requisition my issue in my favour for $2:000 charged on the ration fund—for which I shall stand charged untill, I produce the vouchers—I drew drafts for my salery as governor on the Treasury—in favour of Capt. M. Crupper, to enable me to obtain the vouches now in the office for the amount of rations actually furnished by him to the Indians I am Respectfully Your Obt Servt Wm P. DUVAL

law of the Territory. The Judge holds his appointment under the United States; & the laws of the United States establish the salary which he is to receive for his services in that office.
The Committee, as at present informed, are not able to perceive how any law of the Territory can authorize the Judge to receive any compensation in the shape of fees, for his official services in the place which he holds under the authority of the United States—The distance of the parties, however, from the seat of Government, renders it wholly impracticable to make any investigation into the particular circumstances of the case, during the present session of Congress.
The Committee therefore pray that they may be discharged from any further consideration of the resolution.

30 The opening of land offices in East and West Florida, to which were to be appointed registers and receivers, was provided for by sects. 8 and 9 of the act approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 756). Overton was nominated for the appointment as register on Feb. 14, 1825, and confirmed on Feb. 16 (Senate, Exec. Journal, III, 413, 415). He did not serve long in this position. See post, p. 253. During several preceding years a number of applications had been received for appointments to land offices in Florida (NA, SD, Applications). On behalf of George Walton, Sen. John Elliott (Ga.) wrote the President, Feb. 16, 1821, recommending him for receiver. John W. Overton, of Nashville, Tenn., was recommended to the President for appointment as register or receiver by Rep. Newton Cannon (Tenn.), Feb. 26, 1821. John Rodman, of New York, applied to the President for an appointment as register, Mar. 8, 1821. Thomas Mitchell, of Athens, Ga., applied to Josiah Meigs, Commissioner of the General Land Office, for appointment as surveyor general, register, or receiver, Mar. 24, 1821, and Stevens Thomas, of the same place, wrote to the same official recommending Mitchell, Mar. 24, 1821. Joseph Hutchinson, of Augusta, Ga., was recommended to the President for register or receiver by Sen. Nicholas Ware (Ga.) and Rep. Robert R. Reid
(Ga.), Apr. 29, 1822. Gov. DuVal recommended Craven P. Luckett to the President for register at Tallahassee, Sept. 29, 1824. J. Woodruff, a former officer of the Army, wrote Andrew Jackson from Charleston, Feb. 16, 1821, asking his support in obtaining an appointment as receiver or land commissioner in E. Fla, where he wanted to develop a plantation (LC, Jackson Papers, Vol. 58).
A number of other letters to George Graham are to be found in NA(GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.). One from Walter Taylor, of Lunenberg Co., Va., stated his brother was an applicant, July 7, 1824. Luckett was also recommended by Joseph M. White for an appointment in the Territory, particularly as register, Oct. 15, 1824. For the position of receiver in W. Fla., John P. DuVal was recommended by John Spence, of Dumfries, Nov. 29, 1824. Edwin R. Alberti, a lieutenant in the U. S. Army, applied for appointment as register or receiver in E. Fla., Dec. 9, 1824. An application from James Williams, of Port Deposit, Md., Jan. 28, 1825, expressed an interest in the position of register or receiver.
It was evidently the intention of the Government to appoint land officers for E. Fla. at this time, for on Feb. 28, 1825, G. W. Ward, of Florida, was nominated for the appointment as register for E. Fla. and Moses Green, of Va., for that of receiver. Both nominations were laid on the table on Mar. 3 (Senate, Ezec.
Journal, III, 421, 427).

<docbody>Since I have been the District attorney of East Florida, it has been frequently mentioned in my presence, (and I have been satisfied of the truth of the statement) that in the District of East Florida many trespasses have been and now are committing on the public lands, for the purpose of cutting timber, the preservation of which is particularly important to the government, as you must be convinced. As the law officer of the United States for that District, I would have taken steps to arrest the trespasses I have alluded to, but for the peculiar circumstances and situation of Florida as it respects the soil and the interests of the inhabitants of that territory, which I will relate to you, and of which you are perhaps not unacquainted and unadvised. The trespasses on the public land are now becoming so common, and the consequent destruction of public timber so great, that I should be wanting in my duty, were I not to call your attention to this subject, with the hope that you may suggest a remedy and that I may be advised from the department of which you are a member how I shall I act in this business, and after I have laid before you the reasons which have heretofore induced me not to take any measures to prevent the depredations complained of, you will perceive the case is not without difficulties. In the Eastern section of Florida, nearly three millions of acres of land, are claimed by individuals as private property. These private claims are scattered over the whole surface of East Florida some of them are of small and moderate extent, others are of the most astonishing magnitude All of the above claims, (with one or two exceptions) emenated from the Spanish government, and are very varied in character &c. Some were made absolute and unconditional, the rest were upon some conditions and with restrictions, which by a part of the claimants have been observed and complied with, while others have totally disregarded them or else have conformed to so limited a degree, that their titles to say the least are very exceptionable. Of
<pb#221/>
the absolute grants made by or purporting to have been by the Spanish government, many are questionable on the ground that the Spanish authorities transcended their power in making them and that they are forged and fraudulent. Some of these grants, even when absolute, are without a location, and where there are locations and surveys, the same are so vague and undefined, that often, the most experienced would be at a loss to designate the spot called for by the survey. A board of Commissioners have been appointed to decide upon the merit & validity of the above claims, & although that board has been diligently employed in the discharge of the duties assigned them, yet they still have to determine many principles of Spanish law affecting land titles in E. Florida and after they shall have done this, still each case will have to be settled by the commissioners, as the evidence adduced by the claimant may and frequently gives his claim a new and different aspect and induces the commissioners to confirm what they had resolved to reject. Hence the difficulty is, that should persons be sued for trespassing on lands claimed by grants not yet confirmed by the land Commissioners, the title would be tried by a tribunal different from the one intended by Congress, and where the title has been confirmed but the location not defined by the Commissioners, enable the party to locate his land grant in a manner different from what the law may intend and hereafter point out, and should any harsh remedies be resorted to, many innocent persons may be injured and perhaps ruined thereby.
I am afraid you will find this communication very crude and unsatisfactory, it has been written in great hurry, as I I have to leave Washington this morning, but it will afford me great pleasure to give you any information you may wish on this subject, and which it is in my power to furnish I remain, Sir Your ob' Ser'

<place-time>CAMP NEAR BIG SWAMP 2" March 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Since my letter to you of the 22” Ultimo;* I have seen Cap'
Clark of the Q" Masters department, who left Tampa Bay, some weeks since, for the purpose of Surveying a route for a road to Cape Sable:
after progressing as far as Charlotte Harbor, he was obliged to return for want of provisions: he states however, his belief that the route would not have been practicable much farther, and that he would have been Compelled, oweing to the marshiness of the Country to return;
even had not his supplies failed. I mention this for the purpose of exhibiting to you a Correct idea of the Character of that portion of the Territory assigned to the Indians under the Treaty Concluded at Moultrie Creek.”
The principle object however of this Communication is to per form what I deem to be a duty. in reporting Certain facts detailed to me by Cap" Clark in relation to some of the Fisheries established on the Florida Coast and particularly those about Charlotte Harbour which appear to require early attention. It is ascertained beyond a doubt, that through the medium of these establishments, a Constant intercourse is kept up, between the Indians of this Territory and the Island of Cuba, it is a very Common thing for the Indians (sometimes the Chiefs) to make visits in the Wessels belonging to the Fishery to the Havanna, where they are welcomed by the public Authorities of the Island, and when ready to depart, are sent away loaded with presents, the injurious tendency of such a state of things is easily immagioned—
Through the same Channel, Spirituous liquors are regularly introduced among the Indians, who do not hesitate to say, that they Can obtain it at any time, by a visit to the Fisheries.
In fact Jumper, one of the principle men of the Southern Indians told Cap" Clark, who saw him at Charlotte Harbor, that he was then
<pb#223/>
waiting for the return of a party of his Men, who had gone to Havanna, to procure him a supply of Rum.—It is well understood also, that Runaways Slaves are often Carried off in these Wessels, sometimes as free, & at others taken to Cuba and Sold.—The importance of an early knowledge of these facts by the department, will account for there not being Communicated through the Superintendent of the Territory.”

<docbody>HON” SAMUEL. L. SOUTHWARD Secretary of the Navy SIR It is important, to the ef the United States, that some effectual measures, should be speedily taken, to preserve the ship-timber in the Territory of Florida.
The Navy of the United States, (if it is not at this moment) will soon be dependant on Florida for the live oak and red cedar so essential to its existence. A great waste in a short time, has been committed on the Publick timber, so much so, as to satisfy me, that the utmost attention & vigilence is required to preserve it. Allow me to suggest that some person should be appointed to visit S*Andrews bay and the coast of Florida and report on the lands best timbered which should be reserved for the use of the Navy—All squatters who may be on the lands reserved should be immediately removed, for these settlers distroy much of the best wood, by belting the trees. In order to prevent shipment of valuable timber and to prevent Smuggling on the Florida coast, three revenue Cutters will be necessary for such an extent of sea-board. One should cruise along the coast from Pensacola to Charlotte habour, another should be station'd at Key West, which should ply round Cape Florida, from Charlotte river on west, to Indian River on the East of the cape,; the third should be stationed at the mouth of Sº Johns river, to cruise to the mouth of Indian river.
This is the only effectual measure that can be adopted to secure, the shiptimber and to suppress smuggling.
Their is no part of our coast, so exposed as Florida ahd or which presents so many little rivers, inlets, and bays, remote from, our settlements—If an organized system of Smuggling, is once fully in operation, it will cost much time, trouble, and expence to suppress it.
If measures are, taken in due time, much revenue will be secured to the Government, and the most valuable shiptimber preserved which if distroyed nature will not replace in an age. If you should deem it advisable to appoint an agent to examine the Florida coast for the purpose of reporting to the government the particular tracts of land, best timbered, and convenient to the Gulph of Mexico, permit me, to recommend the Hon." Timothy Twitchel of Pensacola, as best quallified from his knowledge of ship building and of the coast, to execute this trust—This gentleman has information, experience, activity and honestty “
No reply found. See post, p. 212.

Wm P. DUVAL
[Endorsed] To the Pres' The preservation of live oak timber is an object of great importance to the future interests of the Navy—and fears are entertained that much of the most valuable in Florida will be destroyed if immediate measures be not taken to secure it, I have therefore to propose that an agent be appointed to examine that Country, & report to the Dep" on the quality quantity & location of it—with the best means of secuing & preserving it. Timothy Twitchel Esq. has been represented to me as a fit person—and it is supposed that he make can examine & report in the eethºse ef the before the next Session of Congress. The expence would probably amount to 4 or 500 $ & might be paid out of the Contingent app" of the Navy “—Return this to me M* Boyle letter to Pres’t written

<docbody>SIR. In this district several persons have been cutting and selling live oak from lands the title to which have not been confirmed to them by the Land commissioners; a few weeks since Doct' James Hall
<pb#233/>
sold live oak to the amount of about five hundred Dollars from a tract of land which was petitioned for many years before the session of Florida to the United States for a mill seat; a grant was ordered by the Spanish government on the petitioner complying with certain conditions, & two of the land commissioners inform me, that no one of the Conditions have been performed: I went on the land for the purpose of forbidding the person to whom Dº Hall had sold the Timber from cutting it—as the title is in the U. States; the Timber however had been felled and Doctº Hall had received Two hundred and fifty Dollars on account—I directed the Contractor not to pay any further sum to Hall until it was ascertained if he had a title to the land—
I have just stopped persons from cutting on a nother tract of land similarly situated—and have been threatened with prosecutions for interfering—I did consider it my duty to interfere, where I saw persons disposing of timber from lands, evidently belonging to the United States—the individual claims to which cannot be sustained—
In the Case of Hall and Timber was cut down before I arrived on the land, I did not feel myself authorised to go further than to direct that no further payment should be made to him—
I do not know if I am authorised to interfere in this business—and will thank you to instruct me on the subject—and if this communication is not properly addressed to you—that you will be pleased to refer it to the officer who is authorised to give instructions on the Subject—I am convinced that since the session of Florida to the United States, much valuable Timber has been sold by persons who had no claim either in law or equity—

<place-time>PENSACOLA, March 10, 1825</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 22° December * & 24 Feb’ last.”—Last summer I was informed of the mule reported in M* Sykes letter to Gen' Gaines, by a man who wished to purchase it, but as I knew of no stray mule belonging to the Q" M* Department, I could not sell.—There is some mistake about it; the mule in question must have strayed from movers, & perhaps being at the same time the troops were in that Country the inhabitants supposed it belonged to them.—I had a mule injured by a fall near the Conecuh River, which eventually caused its death, as will be seen by my accounts for the last quarter.—
The troops have crossed the Choctawhatchie River with the Military Road and are now at work between that and the Appalachicola.-
Their progress has been greatly retarded by the continued falls of Rain during the past winter, which have literally flooded the Country;
indeed it is a matter of Surprise to me that all the causeways &
bridges have not been washed up. As it is, although none are broken up, yet very considerable repairs, principally renewing the covering of earth on the Causeways in the Swamps, will have to be done by the troops on their return march.-If I had ever seen the lands of Florida so much inundated as they are now, in my first estimate instead of $51,000. I should have laid it at the least at $100,000.-
The delays occasioned by the wet weather and the additional work rendered necessary together will cause an expense of 33 per cent advance upon my first calculations for the labor of the troops.-I
hope however yet to be able to get through with the sums now appropriated. It is safest I have always found to calculate the cost of a work after it is finished, so many unexpected contingencies, impossible to foresee or to prevent if forseen, continually arise to defeat the most prudent calculations. However I feel Confident that as it regards NA (HF, Orig. Reports, TD, Land Claims in E. Fla., 19 Cong., 1 sess.). The reports are printed in H. Doc. 115, 19 Cong., 1 sess., and reprinted in A. S. P., Pub.
Lands, Iv, 561–748, with accompanying documents relative to land claims, which are also to be found in the GLO records. The minutes of the proceedings of the commissioners, covering Mar. 28 to Dec. 30, 1825, are printed ibid., pp. 576-596.
The records of the board are preserved in the Florida State Department of Agriculture, Tallahassee, Fla., and can be found listed in the inventory cited ante, p. 198, n.
1: NA (WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 7), informing that the collector at New Orleans would pay cash for his drafts.
<pb#238/>
expenses the General is assured I shall use all possible economy, and also is fully aware of the casualties that attend the execution of works whether by individuals for their private benefit, or in the hands of agents for the public. It is the opinion of practical men here that less than $30,000, would not have defrayed the expense of opening the Road to Choctawhatchie by hired workmen—that calculation however is large, yet much work has been done; numerous small bridges have been built, & also two large Bridges over rapid streams, the one about 330 feet long, and the other 250 feet with about three hundred yards of Causeway.—I have found good mechanics among the Soldiers, which obviates the necessity & expense of employing Citizens to construct Bridges.—
My accounts for the last quarter will be transmitted by the next mail—
The original Contracts for the Road will be forwarded so soon as I have taken Copies; as also all others in my possession.” I was not aware of the necessity of forwarding the originals, but supposed they were to be retained in the Office here until accomplished."—

<docbody>SIR, Accompanied herewith, I have the honor to forward you the plats * and field notes * of twenty three Townships heretofore reported—The Surveyor ordered to run out Township 1 Range 5.
South and East reported it impracticable, being all under water.
For the want of necessary Stationary on my arrival, I was under the necessity of dispensing with Contracts, for these Townships and had them Surveyed under Special instructions, Copies of which Can be forwarded if required—the Acct” of the Deputies accompanying my general accounts for the Quarters ending 31* Dec 1824, and 31st inst, herewith enclosed,” will perhaps be Sufficient Satisfaction—You
<pb#240/>
have also enclosed the Contracts * made with the Deputys for the Surveys now under progress—By reference to Township 2 Range 1
Nº & West you will observe the meanders of the Ockalockany river are not taken; this deficiency exists from that river overflowing its banks throughout the winter and Still too high to effect that object—
I shall have it effected before the Sale if practicable, otherwise it will Suggest itself to your mind to reserve the Sections on its borders from Sale until it shall be Surveyed. That river was So narrow in Township 3, Range 1 Nº and West, that it was deemed advisable to run the Section lines over it, this Township has from recent information about 3 Small islands in the arm of the Harmonia Lake running into it, but I have not been enabled to detach a Surveyor to meander them,--The quality of the Islands in the Harmonia Lake, added to its beauty, will will render them desireable in the eyes of purchasers in that vacinity.
Permit me again to draw your attention to the Subject of funds for the purpose of paying off the Deputies, as a large portion of the Contracts will be Completed in April, and they have manifested a Strong hope to be able to return to their respective homes, as soon thereafter as possible.
I have likewise enclosed you my Account for Salaries, which together with the balance due me on the General Account, I will be more than obliged to you to remit me as Soon as possible, I shall want it at the land Sales.
I Contemplate arranging my business to enable me to leave for Tennessee immediately after the land Sales, with a view to remove my family the ensuing fall and the returns of the Surveys now in progress, will during my absence be So arranged and forwarded as to enable me to report them in a few weeks after my return.
I shall be pleased to learn that my first essay in this department, has been executed in a manner Satisfactory to you, and Shall be thankful for the Communication of any improvements that may Suggest themselves on examination *—

<docbody>THE HON: BERNARDO SEGUI Mayor of St Augustine Florida SIR Your letter to the Secretary of War dated the 22" Ult” ”
covering a copy of a correspondence with Captain Dan' E. Burch
“relative to the mode of terminating the public road at St Augustine”, has been referred to this office; and I regret that the appropriation for the road is so small as to put it entirely out of my power to authorize the erecting of a Bridge over the St Sebastians how desirable soever it might be to do so. The road from Pensacola to St Augustine was authorized by Congress with a view of affording a direct communication between important military posts, and of facilitating the settlement of the interior of Florida.--Most of the lands through which it will pass belongs to the public, and in making the appropriation, Congress acted upon the general principle that the proprietor of the land is bound to make the road.
Should Congress think proper to authorize the building of a bridge over the St: Sebastians, and make an adequate appropriation, it would afford me great pleasure to carry their views into effect in a manner the most satisfactory to the Citizens of St: Augustine: but until that be done I have no authority to act, for I have no right to make engagements on public account not authorized by actual appropriations.”

<docbody>SIR. The preservation of live Oak Timber is an object of great importance to the future interests of the Navy; and fears are entertained, that much of the most valuable in Florida, will be destroyed, if immediate measures be not taken to secure it.

Timothy Twitchel Esq., has been represented to me, as a fit person, and it is supposed that he can examine, and report before the next Session of Congress.

SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Letter of the 22" ultimo,” enclosing two accounts for various services in Florida, 500$ and 1000$–Gen' Call, a few days before the adjournment of Congress, presented to me for payment a duplicate of the latter
1000$ which was submitted to the then President, Mr Monroe, who authorized the payment of 750$ in full thereof—This sum I paid to Gen' Call, on the 3° instant, the account bearing your receipt—In reference to that of 500$, covered by your letter of 22" ultimo, I can only say that the Florida fund is reduced to the small sum of $44.18/
100, and that I am now about to pay an account of upwards of 40%
which in regard to the time of its reception must necessarily take precedence of yours.

<place-time>ST AUGUSTINE April 19. 1825–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Your letter of the 24 Ult. relative to the spoliations committed on the public timber in this territory, was received by the last mail.”
So far as my vigilance will avail, be assured, Sir, that every thing shall be done, to prevent and arrest all encroachments upon government lands, for the future. Since the commencement ef the present of the present session of the board of land commissioners, I have urged upon them the great necessity of adjudicating one or two classes of the claims existing in Florida, which when done will enable me to proceed in this business, with much greater satisfaction, both to myself and the inhabitants generally. I am happy to inform you, that the Commissioners manifest a great inclination to facilitate my views & to aid
<pb#257/>
the discharge of my official duties, by acting immediately on those claims. The decission of the Commissioners, to which much respect is due, will have the desired tendency of settling the most important points and difficulties connected with private land titles in this district, and the officers of government will be enabled to distinguish with much more certainty, the property belonging to the United States. In the course of a few days, I calculate that the Commissioners, by the decissions I have called for, will have removed the obstacles that might have embarrassed me in this business.
The presence of the Cutters, you spoke of in your letter, will I hope have a beneficial effect, the adoption of this measure was urged upon government by Govr. Duval during his visit at Washington, last winter. The officers of these vessels, are I believe, appointed by the President on the nomination of the Secretary of the Treasury. Permit me to solicit your good offices to procure from the Secretary the command of one of the cutters for Capn. John Whalton of St Augustine.
An intimate acquaintance with this gentleman, who has resided here, a number of years, enables me to speak with confidence of his standing as a gentleman of honourable feelings integrity and intelligence. Of his skill in seamanship and navigation I can say nothing of my own knowledge, being ignorant of such things, but reputation assigns him a character of being highly and eminently qualified and skilled in them, as also for being an active and enterprizing sailor. No one can be selected, who has a more perfect knowledge of this coast than Capn Whalton, he was for a long time engaged in the navigation of the neighbouring seas, and when employed by Capn Ramage of the U. S.
Navy as pilot to the vessels engaged in making a survey of the Florida coast, I am authorised to say that he gave the most entire satisfaction.
Capn Whalton has claims upon our government, he had resided in Florida a few years previous to the exchange of flags, and by his very gentlemanly deportment and an intermarriage with an amiable and interesting Spanish lady, acquired considerable influence with the native Floridians which was constantly and often successfully exerted in adjusting and quieting the many broils that originated between the Americans and Spaniards and conciliating the latter towards our government, and when the yellow fever, that prevailed here in 1821, was raging to an extent that proved fatal to so many of our countrymen, this gentleman and his whole family were among the few, that did not shrink from visiting the sick bed of the stranger and administering that relief & consolation which could not have been claimed even from the hand of friendship. Govr. Duval & Gen Call have on various occassions furnished to some of the departments, the most flattering testimonials of this Captain Whalton, & have reeehamehd recommended him for an employment and command of a cutter—And as in
<pb#258/>
this instance your branch of the department, is particularly interested in the object for which the cutters are to be stationed on this coast, I
hope you will not consider the request I have made intrusive; be pleased however, to accept as an apollogy the best of motives for my so doing—”

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE April 21 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR, I have been here since the 7, but the woods are so rotten that I have made but little progress in examining the Country—from what I have seen however with the concurrent opinions of all those who are best informed on the subject, I have no doubt but I will select the first Township North in Range 1 East—in point of soil it is superior to any other Township I have seen or heard of and its vicinity to this place adds much to is value—As far as I have examined it I
have seen no land that may not be cultivated to advantage and a great portion of it first rate—we have not had three fair days since I arrived, yesterday was very fine and I went over several sections, if the weather continues as it now promises I think I will be able to satisfy myself fully in ten days or two weeks.-The greatest objection I see to the country is the extraordinary number of Ponds that abound thro all the rich lands—many of them abeth d with furnish plenty of good fish and are supposed to be fed by subterraneous streams, I have seen running from some of them as pretty rivulets of spring water as I
have ever seen in any other section of our Country—It is from that circumstance generally believed they will not be likely to genrate those fevers usually apprehended from stagnant waters. If people can enjoy health here it is certainly the most delightful region I have ever seen, but with all the advantages it offers you may expect to hear of but few spots selling above the minimum price—The high waters I
presume have prevented many who might have been purchasers from exploring the country and the few that will attend may all be satisfied without competition—consequently I think it will not be adviseable

to urge the sale of any portion of the General's in less than a year from this time they must be in demand at liberal prices as soon as wealthy planters begin to form establishments in the country—there is little doubt but the sugar cane and Sea Island Cotton will succeed here.

<place-time>PENSACOLA, April 21* 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 9th 78—15th 79—15th 80–17th 81–22d 82—& 26th 83 Ultimo.—
On the subject of my monthly Summary Statements I beg leave respectfully, in explanation, to refer to my letter of 30° Sept. last.*
Those now due will be made out & transmitted forthwith; but my duties at the present moment & for some months to come must necessarily cause delay in their rendition.—
I shall for the present make no contract for that part of the Road between the St: John's River & St: Augustine but defer it until I
have ascertained clearly how the funds appropriated are like to hold out. In any event upon further reflection it seems hardly worth the
<pb#260/>
expense to build a Bridge over the St: Sebastian's where a ferry will answer every useful purpose, to afford a “recreation” for the inhabitants of St: Augustine, & which the corporation would hardly ever be able to renew or even to keep in repair after it was built. I
shall do my utmost to complete the road for the amounts already appropriated, but if I fail in doing so, I feel confident that no extravagance in my expenditures will be imputed to me. The season has been so very wet & unfavorable for work that it has caused delay &
much more expense than could have been reasonably anticipated.—
My arrangements will be fully made for the proper continuance of my duties at Pensacola, the Barrancas, and on the Road, when I shall make no unnecessary delay in repairing to Mobile Point for the duty assigned me there; but it is indispensably necessary for myself & for the public service that I should first inspect the troops at work on the road as well as the Contractors. This however will cause no delay in the investigation at the Point as I am not informed where Colonel Russell “" now is, of course do not know at what time he can meet me there; besides Lieut. Alexander,” one of the material witnesses, must be summoned from Tampa Bay. In the performance of this duty I
beg leave to assure you, General, that I shall do my utmost to give satisfaction, & at the same time do strict justice to both parties, and deep will be my mortification if I should fail to meet your expectations.—
The sum allowed for opening the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay is very small, but the goodness of the Road must be graduated by it if openened throughout the whole extent contemplated. Captain Clarke has marked out the Road in the best possible direction from Tampa Bay to its point of intersection with the Road from Pensacola to St:
Augustine, at the St. Fé natural Bridge; and it now only remains for me to mark out the Road from Coleraine to a suitable point of intersection with the one he has marked out which will probably be a few miles south of Wanton's, (or which is the same thing, a few miles north of the Ouithlachuchy River.) The law I notice specifies Wanton's particularly, but I have reason to believe that there is better ground for the Road to pass over a few miles East of Wanton's.--
But I take it for granted that that Point was merely named in the law as being a conspicuous one on the map.–I have hitherto referred to it myself for that reason only.”—In marking this Road I want neither party nor soldiers with me but shall employ one or two active woodsmen living in & well acquainted with the localities of the Coun-
<pb#261/>
try, also a competent guide from among the Indians;–in this both economy & expedition will be consulted. I am at a loss to determine whether to mark out the Road immediately or postpone it until the ensuing fall.” My present journey will take me as far as the Suwannee River from whence it would not engage more than four weeks to make the Survey & if it is not done at once the season will have advanced too far to do it after I shall have been at Mobile Point. I am now of opinion that I have sufficient time to mark out the Road & return here in full time to meet Col. Russell & the witnesses at the Point.
However no avoidable delay will occur in marking out the Road &
completing it either by Contract or by the labor of the troops; it is probable however that it will not be commenced until october next.”—
The troops have openend near to the Appalachicola River & I
believe will have finished all that part of the Road not contracted for West of the St: John's River by the first of June next. In that case the troops will be at the disposal of the Department to work on the Road from Colerain if no contract is made;—But in order to prevent all difficulty & place me on a proper footing in regard to them, I
request you will be pleased to cause an order to be issued from the Adjutant General's Office, directing the Com" officer to furnish men On my Requisition to work on the Road from Colerain, similar to the Order issued in relation to furnishing the men to work on the Road to St. Augustine. With the present Senior officers no difficulty of the kind would occur, but changes might take place when an adherence on the part of the Com" officer to a supposed point of Etiquette would embarrass me greatly & retard all operations.”

<place-time>PENSACOLA, May 3" 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose herewith an estimate for funds for the 3" Quarter of 1825.” At the end of the last month but a small amount of funds remained on hand after crediting the amount received from Mº Chew, not quite sufficient to meet the demands on the Q Mrs: dept. then due. I postponed drawing for the $10000, until the last supposing it likely I should receive remittances.—
I have included in the estimate one half of the amount appropriated for the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay under an impression that Capt. Clark will require some part of it, and also that he will make some requisitions on me which will require disbursements from that appropriation specially. I do not expect to want any part of the appropriation for the Road to St: Augustine before the close of the year excepting the $5000 on my last estimate.
This is said to have been the most unfavorable season known in the Country on account of the continued rains. I have however the satisfaction to be able to state that the Bridges & Causeways on the military Road stand uninjured by the heavy freshets excepting that much of the sand is washed from off the latter and must be renewed by the troops on their return march.” The very unfavorable season added to the disadvantage of having had so few men at work, the number never having exceeded ninety including non-commissioned officers, has caused an additional expense of $3000, in opening the Road.
Forage too has been scarce and dear. Corn is selling at 1.75 to $2, per bushel in the Settlement where the troops now are. It is one dollar per bushel here & the expenses attending its transportation would more than balance the difference of price if purchased and sent from here. There has been expended on the road $8000, which added to

the two Contracts (16,500$,) leaves a balance on the appropriations of $3500.-This Balance will be expended in defraying outstanding debts, extra pay due to the men, & in necessary expenses for the troops returning to their post.—There will then remain Seventeen miles of road between St: John's River & St: Augustine for which there will be no funds."—To complete this will require an additional sum of $5000, whether performed by the labor of the Troops or by Contract.—The late extraordinary rise in the price of Cotton will however divert the attention of the owners of negroes to its production; and I have no idea that a contract could now be obtained either for it or the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay such as it would be for the interest of the U. States to accept.—As there will be no funds remaining from the appropriations I beg leave to ask your instructions whether the Road shall be completed in the fall, so soon as the season shall permit, without waiting for an appropriation, with the view that if no appropriation is asked for or made, that that amount of the expenses of the road shall be taken from the funds of the Q" Mrs:
Dept.-In case it is decided to complete it I shall, unless a very favorable contract for it offers, make my arrangements to do it with the labor of the troops and by them at the least possible expense.—
After this Road is finished there will remain on hand property, which if taken into the Q" Mrs: Dept. or applied to the service of the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay, worth $3350:-If sold at auction it would realize but little, & in any event I had determined to retain
& preserve all the property, excepting a part of the mules which I
should have sold on account of the expense of foraging them. They will all however now be required for the service of the other road.-It is to be observed too that while the troops have been on the Road the expense of fuel has been saved to the Q" Mrs: dept.; also the forage of seven mules belonging to the dept: & employed in the service of the Road, amounting in all to $1695.-I thought perhaps these facts might operate in favor of charging some part of the expenses of the Road upon the Q" Mrs: funds, though I should much prefer to See a special appropriation.

<docbody>SIR, Your letter of the 22* of March” enclosing an act of Congress passed the last session, to open a road from St. Marys River Georgia to Tampa by the way of Wantons,' was received yesterday; as this route will be considerably east of the road already marked by me to the Suwanne River, agreeable to your instructions of the 14” of April last,” I conclude there is to be two routes to communicate with the interior, as I have never been through to Wantons it will be imposible to select the best posible route without, first going through and marking it out, I called on Col Brooke the Com* Officer of this post, and shew him the act of Congress with your instructions to me on the subject, He has received no orders on the subject of placing the men under my direction, and probably will not before the middle of June he resquests me to say to you that between that time and the 10" of October it will be imposible for the men to live in the woods, owing to excessive heat and the rainy season which commences in July and lasts until October.”—
I shall proceed to Pensacola by the first Wesel and endeavour to procure the requisite tools, supplies &c for opening the road, so soon as the men are placed under my charge, I shall use evey posible exertion in my power to open the road in the shortest posible time."—

to which the following reply was made on the next day, SIR In answer to your note of yesterday where you state that as
“Keeper of the Public Archives” you are prepared to receive the papers under our charge, we have to state that we do not think ourselves authorised to let them go from under our charge, until we receive directions so to do from the President of the United States, or the Secretary of State.

This detention of the Public Documents from the proper officer is a serious inconvenience to many of the inhabitants who are desirous of obtaining Official copies of sundry papers, with which I am unable to furnish them from not having the originals in my possession. The President could not have anticipated an occurrence of this kind, as he instructed me to discontinue the work of Copying for the Present, as there was no appropriation for the payment of the expenses attending it.
I would beg leave to suggest that these Gentlemen should be also directed to place me in possession of the work they may have already done, as also the Blank books & stationary, which they have on hand, * Ante, p. 205.
<pb#268/>
in order that they may be applied to the same object at any time hereafter that the President of the U. States or Congress should think proper to order a continuance of the Work, In the meanwhile I shall as soon as I can obtain a house or secure room for an office, open that part of the Archives which remain in my possession as Keeper of the Public Archives under the Territorial Laws, in order to accommodate the Public as far as I have it in my power, until I receive your instructions on the subject."

Congress by their act of the 3" March 1823. declared, “That all waters on which Steam Boats regularly pass from port to port, shall be considered & established as post roads, subject to the provisions contained in the several acts regulating the P. O. establishment.” 7
The 19* Sec: of the present P. O. law,” prohibits any Wessell which regularly plies on a Water declared to be a post road, from conveying any letters except such as relate to some part of the Cargo, under the penalties therein provided. Steam Boats, of course, are not embraced in this prohibition. From the above provisions you will see, that any Wessel, except a S Boat, which shall convey a letter (except it relates to a part of the Cargo; unless by contract with this Dep", on any water, on which a S Boat, performs regular trips, is liable to a penalty of $50, with costs of suit. This law, if faithfully enforced, will effectually prevent the abuse of which you complain. I take it for granted, that S Boats do regularly ply in y Waters, & they must be considered as post roads. The 19* Sec: of the law seems principally to refer to foreign Wessels or Wessels from foreign ports, but I
see no injustice in construeing the provisions of it, so as to embrace, all coasting Wessels which ply on waters that are not post roads, &
the Commanders of which, have occasion to exhibit their papers to
<pb#269/>
the Officers of the Custom house. The Commanders of coasting Wessels, which sail on waters not declared to be post roads, & who, in the delivery of their Cargoes, have not occasion to apply to the Officers of the Custom house, are under no compulsion to delivery letters into the P. O. But it is hoped, that the Commanders of such Wessels, will enter into Contracts for the faithful delivery of all letters under their contract, into the P. O. on their being paid 3 cents, for each letter. With Commanders of Such Wessels, I particularly request, that you would make contracts. In a few days printed contracts will be sent to you, & special instructions on the Subject.”

SIR, Baron de Mareuil, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary from France, has lately addressed a complaint to this Department,” upon an ajudication by the Court of Monroe County, in Florida, which assigned to the Officers and Men who rescued the French Ship Calypso from the hands of pirates, in the last year, a Rate of salvage which he considers extremely exorbitant and unjust, being more than eighty per cent upon the value of the property saved.
In the absence of the Secretary, I take the liberty, therefore, of requesting your good offices, to procure from the Officer of that Court a brief statement of its proceedings, in the case referred to, that we may be enabled satisfactorily I hope, to give an answer to the French Minister. I make this application to you, without knowing whether Monroe County belongs to West Florida, or not, or whether the lately appointed Attorney (to whom properly it should have been addressed) for that portion of the territory, has yet repaired to his post, or not; but I do so under the impression that your local knowledge and experience will readily indicate to you the source whence the desired statement may be obtained, and that your kindness will induce a ready compliance with my request.”

SIR, I have the Honor to report, that the difficulty and delay, occasioned by the want of a regular Communication with Some Post route, are productive of great public, as well as private inconvenience.
It not unfrequently happens, that letters are three months in reaching Tampa Bay, from Washington by the Pensacola route, through which, they are now—Transported;—from the Bay, they would not Come to this place, at all, unless purposely sent for, or Some accidental Conveyance, Should present itself; much embarresment and delay is thus occasioned; and in one or two instances, my letters have been transmitted to the Gen' Post Office, as dead from the Office at Pensacola; the director of which, has not thought proper to send them to me.
I take the liberty to Suggest, that the establishing of a regular line of expresses; between Tampa and S*Augustine, by way of the Agency;
would entirely do away these evils, and afford great facility of Communication for the War Department, with both the Indian Agency—
and the Military Post on Hillsborough.-Letters might with ease be Conveyed Semi-monthly between Canton" Brooke and Sº Augustine and thus more than one half the time now taken in a Communication between the Seat of Government, and that Post, would be Saved:—
<pb#273/>
the expense attending Such an establishment, must be trifling, Compared with the extensive and important advantages—to be produced by it.
The Indians, or some of their Negroes—might be induced, for a moderate Sum, to Transport between St. Augustine and the Agency;
and from the latter place; letters could be taken to Canton" Brooke, by a Military express-Between the two last mentioned Points, the distance is only about eighty Miles (three easy days ride) and from the Agency to S' Augustine, is about the Same distance.—

For the purpose of extending to the territory of Florida, the benefit of mail communications, in a degree adjusted to its existing circumstances, on the 25* Ap'* last a letter of instruction was despatched to the P. M at Tallahassee, empowering him to contract with some suitable person, for the regular transmission of a mail every fortnight between that place & Early C.h. G*; where it was intended to connect it with the line, lately established between Hartford G* & Montgomery A. The latter establishm’ got into operation it appears, on the 19* of last month, under the superintendence of the P.M. at Hartford, & in charge of M* M*loud " of the same place. Both these persons by letters of the 16" & 23% ult” recommend that the contemplated connection between the mail from Hartford G* & Montgomery A. & that from Tallahassee, should be formed at Pinderville in Dooly C", in preference to Early C.h., & assign some reasons for their advice.
By a reference to the Maps in the Dep" however, the distance which this would require the Tallahassee mail to travel, is at least twice as great as the distance from Early C. h. to Tallahassee; & this circumstance presents so strong an impression against the proposition, that unless it should appear that the Maps cannot be relied on, I am disposed to adhere to the first project. Counting upon y' accurate local knowledge of that Country, I beg leave to invite y' attention to the Subject, & y' opinion as to the comparative advantages & elegibility of the two plans.

<place-time>PENSACOLA, June 17* 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to report that on my arrival at the Appalachicola River in May last I found that Mº Robinson had not completed his contract nor was likely to do so in any reasonable time;*—the continued high waters in the Winter & Spring he assigned as the cause of the delay—a cause which I knew myself to have existed. As the troops had arrived at the Appalachicola more than a month earlier than I had calculated upon, I deemed it to be indispensable to the convenience of the public that the road should be opened forthwith through the Swamp of that River by them, to enable travellers to use the road. In consequence of which I made an agreement with Mº Robinson by which he relinquished the Contract into my hands, & I paid him for the work actually done—
having regard to the work remaining to do & the amount of the Contract.—I paid him $.1000.-& he relinquishes the remaining
$.2000.--—The troops then opened the Road through the Swamp
& ten miles East of it, to a point where it intersects a cart Road leading from the Appalachicola River towards Tallahassee:-the remainder of the Road specified in the Contract having been opened by Robinson with the exception of not having the Bridged the creeks on his part of the Route. The opening of this part of the Road by the troops did not cause an additional expense of one hundred dollars to the U. States, as they were upon the spot with their supplies.
The Bridges however on the part of the Road opened by Robinson are only temporary such as will answer the purpose for the Summer;
But in the fall I expect to complete this part of the Road by erecting new & permanent Bridges which will probably cause an expense of
$.1000. more.—From this statement you will perceive that by the arrangement with Robinson, the road was not only opened for the accommodation of travellers at once; but that near $.1000 will be gained to the U. States on the Contract:—this saving however was altogether accidental and arose solely from the circumstance of the troops having been upon the ground with their supplies ready to commence without loss of time or extra transportation. I consider that Mr Robinson has lost in the payment made to him for the work he had done, although he was allowed all that could have been equitably given under his contract. He was unfortunate too in having had a Bridge swept away at Little River by a heavy freshet, which
<pb#285/>
had been built by him on the Road, & which must have cost him from four to five hundred dollars; but which was not taken into into consideration, of course, in the Settlement made. I hope that you will approve of the course I pursued in relation to him and his contract, though I myself felt doubtful how far I had authority to release him from the penalty contained in it. I am conscious that in this affair I did only what common justice required towards him &
at the same time consulted the pecuniary interests of the U. States.—
I have deemed it adviseable not to continue the troops at work on the Road during the heat of the Summer & they are now on their return march to Pensacola. On their Return they are making some improvements in their former work, & will be here in about ten days.-
If nothing should occur to prevent, I shall recommence the work by the first of October next, & after completing the Bridges & causeways on the route opened by M. Robinson,” march the detachment to the St. John's River & open the Road from thence into the City of St.
Augustine.” The whole of this will be accomplished by the first of December if the Season is favorable, & the troops being in that part of the Country will be commence without delay on the Road to Tampa Bay. This arrangement will have economy of time & expenditures in regard to both Roads for its primary object, & will have that effect.—
The Contractor for that part of the Road from Ockolockony to St: John's is progressing well with his work and calculates to be ready to deliver it over to me by the first of December next. I have made him a payment of near $.8000, on his contract. This Sum is not in proportion to the work actually done, & for which I was held bound to pay from time to time according to the terms of the advertisement, but I knew that in a short time he would have work done equal to the sum paid him; and moreover I am myself individually, perfectly & fully secured against eventual loss from any difference that existed at the time between the work done and the Sum paid.-
<pb#286/>
I beg leave respectfully to represent that in consequence of my not having received the $.5000.-estimated for on the 8* February last, on account of the Military Road, I find myself greatly embarrassed in my money arrangements. Believing it would arrive so that I could meet my private engagements, I have greatly exceeded the sum I had on hand in my payments on account of the Military Road, as will appear on my Monthly statement for June when it is forwarded. I have therefore earnestly to solicit that if it is not already remitted, it may be soon sent on; and also that the second appropriation of $.8000, may be remitted to me immediately after. It forms no part of my character or desire to have in hands large amounts of public money—hence this request does not originate from any such source.—During the Summer it is my wish to be able to make all the necessary arrangements in regard to funds as well as other objects for the work of the fall & winter.
I shall leave here about the first of October for the interior of Florida
& cannot calculate upon returning to Pensacola before January following, & in the mean time all the disbursements on account of the Road must be made, & that too in the interior of the Country where I shall of necessity be, & where I ought to have the necessary funds with me.—
My Estimate for the 3" Quarter of 1825, forwarded on the 3" Ulto:
contains an item of $.6000, for the Road from Colerain, which will be sufficient to meet all the expenses on that account up to January next.
I have already procured, and furnished some articles to Capt. Clark on account of it, & am about to get more. These accounts I shall keep separate from my Quartermaster's accounts, in the manner prescribed for Expenditures on account of the other Road.—
I enclose herewith a Monthly Summary Statement of the Expenditures on account of the Military Road for May; and Reports of the men on extra duty for April & May.”—
I have the honor to be Sir, With perfect respect Yº Mo. ob. Serv"

<place-time>PENSACOLA, June 18* 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 11th of April last,” and of the 9th * 13th ºf 14** & 20th *
Ulto:—
Receipts for the “Traveller's directory” are enclosed as directed.
A copy of the Book of Post Roads published by the Postmaster General is almost indispensably necessary for me to determine the distances on some routes, I should therefore be glad to be furnished with one. The revised Regulations for the Army which I suppose has been forwarded to me, as the Books have been received at the Post some time back, must have miscarried, in consequence of which I request that another copy may be forwarded to me.—
So soon as applied for, I shall turn over the Barracks &c. at the Barrancas as ordered; but there is no public building in Pensacola which I can turn over to the naval officers unless I rent others for the Q Master's department:-The Storehouse which I have just been repairing and one Blockhouse being all that I have at my disposal.
The two Blockhouses standing in the Street will be given up to the City authorities in a few days, agreably to my former report & your orders:–they are urgent to have them removed.”—I have made a temporary exchange with Capt. Crupper, of the Corner storehouse lately repaired, for two fireproof brick storehouses, both under the same roof, affording four times the Storage, & free from danger by fire;—the Storehouse belonging to the U. States was of wood. The inducement on my part to change was because I obtained better &
more commodious Stores, equally well situated for public purposes;
and on his because he obtained by it a storehouse much more eligibly situated for business and sufficiently large for his object in mercantile business.--So large a quantity of provisions is now on hand here in the Commissary's dep" but that for this exchange of Storehouses I
should have been under the necessity of renting.”—
<pb#288/>
The Season had so far advanced that I deemed it advisable to postpone the survey of the Road from Colerain until the fall, when I can have it done before the troops will be ready to commence working upon it;"—in case they are not otherwise employed, but of which, however, I have not the most distant idea, knowing as well as I believe I
do, the present situation & Temper of the Creek Indians. If however there should be any operations against these Indians during the Summer, I solicit the favor of you General to be allowed to leave my Office in Pensacola for the time in charge of the clerk, which can be done without detriment to the service during the absence of the troops, & accompany the expedition as Quarter-master:-It would be a deep source of mortification to me that a campaign had passed over in the very district of Country where I am stationed & that I had not participated in it.—
Conformably to instructions from Colonel Clinch I have turned over Fort St. Marks to the civil Government of Florida. The Colonel's order & the Governor's receipt are herein enclosed.—
I enclose herewith a monthly Summary Statement for May, and Reports of Persons & articles hired,” and of Stores received for Transportation & distribution. The new Regulations I perceive require monthly estimates for funds; and I accordingly enclose one for July, although I have already estimated for the same month in the 3"
Quarter of the current year.—At Stations like Pensacola remote from Washington City and where so many unexpected causes for expenditure arise, it is almost impossible to estimate for a less period than a quarter; & then with but little of accuracy, excepting as to the regular
& uniform supplies. I hope however that the funds will continue to be remitted quarterly. When absent so frequently & for such long periods from Pensacola, my estimates cannot be furnished with that regularity I could desire.—Believing that the General, knowing what Troops will probably be employed, if any, against the Indians, will remit me funds to meet the expenses occasioned by the movements of the troops, I have omitted to estimate on that account.
By reference to the monthly Statement you will perceive that there is a balance against the U. States. The Settlement of my accounts in the Q" Mrs: dept. for the quarter ending in the current month, will augment this Balance considerably. I can however settle up the Quarter's accounts without difficulty in anticipation of the receipt of the funds should they not have arrived in time. I request that you will be pleased to remit me the funds on account of the Quarter master's department for the 3" Quarter, at an early date, in order that
<pb#289/>
I may have no duty of any kind to detain me here when I shall want to proceed on duty into the interior of the Country;-for my views and intentions in regard to which I beg leave to refer to my letter of Yesterday's date.—
Should any part of the 1* Regiment arrive here, there will be ample quarters at Cantonment Clinch for both officers and Soldiers.-
I leave here tomorrow for Mobile Point, though I can scarcely say with what object, unless to comply with my appointment to be there on or before the first of July, having as yet heard nothing from Colo.
Russel; consequently, being without any account of what he does claim, I have nothing but the law itself to direct me in obtaining the testimony required.”—

<place-time>St. Augustine TERRITORY OF FLORIDA 20° June 1825</place-time>
<docbody>SIR As Mayor of the City of St. Augustine I have been directed by the Corporation, to request from your Department some Specific information respecting the disposition of certain portions of Public property in this place, the use of which is respectively claimed by the Civil and Military Authorities.
To the Cities Sir of every other Territory that has been added to the Union, valuable donations of property have been made by Government, but for some reason of which I am not aware, this customary liberallity has been witheld for Pensacola & St. Augustine, though this places stood particularly in need of assistance from the great poverty, to which they have been reduced by the disturbances which had occurred in the Province previous to the Cession.
The consequences of this course on the part of Government have been peculiarly distressing to St. Augustine. We are at present without the means of paying our City Officers, or even providing for the ordinary expences of the Police, and besides hampered with debts.
We have understood that the Lot called the Hospital Lot together with the Smithy which are now retained by the Military," though not used by them, were at one time ordered to be delivered over to the Corporation, but on some plea or other this has not been done—
The Collector of the Customs also retained possession of two of the most valuable Houses in the Town with a large Lot annexed; and though lately burnt out, still claims an authority over the property"—
Under this circumstances Sir we request that the Commanding Officer here, and the Collector of the Customs may be directed to deliver over to the Corporation, the Lots which have been specified, and that we may be authorized to Dispose of the Stone upon the Same, so as to be enabled to raise Some funds for the use of the City.”
Sir, I have the honor to Yours respectfully BERNARDO SEGUI Mayor TO THE HONORABLE THE SECRETARY OF WAR DEPARTMENT

MY DEAR SIR I forward a package for you from Col M*Kee, you will perceive that he has Selected Township 1. N.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to enclose, Lt. Canfield's report of his movements, with the detachment he commanded, in pursuit of six Indians, of the departure of which you were advised by Major Wilson's communication of the 21 inst.”
I consider the termination of this expedition, unfortunate, as it may have a tendency to exasperate the Indians & induce them to commit some violence—should this occur it will be owing to the injudicious conduct of Mº Solano,” as he saw their permission to visit
” Probably Samuel Cook.
<pb#294/>
that part of the Country, from the Sub Agent, Mr Garey (which together with a letter addressed to Mr G. was found in their Camp, after they had deserted it—A copy of this pass is enclosed: *) & did not make it known to Major Wilson when he applied for his interference & protection—Again,_when the party were about entering the Indian Camp, he prohibited the Interpreter from addressing them as usual, (without Lt Canfields knowledge,) to explain the object of the visit, which gave immediate alarm—and caused them to enquire of him “why he did not talk,”—at this instant they observed the Soldiers, and attempted to take their rifles & escape—which the party present, endeavoured to prevent—in consequence of this I
presume, one of them naturally tried to arm himself with a pistol from the belt of one of the Gentlemen, which produced the firing as has been stated by Lt. Canfield.
As this affair produced some excitement & alarm here, I thought it proper in obedience to your instructions to have an interview with Genl. Hernandez of the Florida Malitia; in which we determined, that the most adviseable method, was to send an express to the Sub-Agent (the Agent being so far distant) stating fully the circumstances as far as they came to my knowledge; & assuring the Indians that no hostility was intended, and if they would come in they should receive the rifles we had, and have the broken one replaced, with provisions to carry them home—desireing him at the same time to use his utmost endeavours to pacify them—as I considered they were only censureable so far as they had in a drunken moment threatened Mº Solano.
Since I commenced this I have been informed that a party of Indians, (believed to be the same, with the addition of their families,)
were met near the S" Johns—they stated their Chief had his arm broken, by Mº Solano, that they were on their way home to make a formal complaint, they appeared perfectly well disposed; & are said to be some of John Hicks's men.
I expect the express will return to-morrow—if he does in time for the mail, will communicate to you, such information as he may bring me.”

SIR, I have the satisfaction by this mail to enclose you a copy of a communication, received by my express, from the Actg. Sub. Agent;”
from which I infer, we have no cause to apprehend future difficulty from this party of Indians:–believing that it was due to the wounded man, to afford him the benefit of Dº Weightmans' * vauable assistance,—and that it would have a salutary effect, in convincing the Indians of our friendly disposition toward them (&as he could without injury leave those of our men who were on the sick list,) I thought it adviseable to direct him to proceed to the residence of the Sub Agent, & give such assistance as was practicable—stating to that Gentleman, that if the Doctor thought the man might be removed without injury I would subsist, & have him attended to, by the Surgeon, until he recovered—at the same time urging him if possible to induce the others of the party, to come in and see me—receive their arms, & skins, if not destroyed, and in that event I would give them the value—In doing this Sir, I have adopted the course that in my judgment, was just, and best qualified to promote harmony; although I almost fear there will be a difficulty in having my accounts passed through the Q Masters Dept.—to obviate this, if you approve of the course I have pursued I
beg leave to request, that you would make a statement on the subject to that Depart" through the Secy of War.
One of the Seminole Indians was in Town, with whom (in the presence, & at the request of Genl. Hernandez,) I had a talk, stating the circumstance of the affair, & desiring him to explain it to his brethern, on his return home, which he promised to do.—directing them in the event of meeting any of the U. S. Troops, to quietly submit if required to do so, & suffer themselves to be brought in, assuring them that no injury should result from it—and further, that you was near, and if any difficulty should occur would punish them—though you were anxious to treat them with kindness, if their Conduct would permit you to do so.”

Near “Fountain of Health”
Davidson County, TENNESSEE. July 1° 1825.
DEAR SIR, On the eve of my departure from Tallahassee, I inclosed you my Accounts for the quarter ending on the 30" ult” and deposited Eight thousand Dollars with Mº Williams Clerk in my office
<pb#297/>
for disbursement during the present quarter on completion of the Contracts of Mess” Stone,” Boyd, & White,” which were delayed on Account of sickness—I had a warm and fatigueing journey, making my residence on the 19*—You were no doubt surprised, (on the receipt of the Account of Sales at Tallahassee) to find the lands selling so low;” several circumstances (in my opinion) gave rise to it; amongst the most prominent were-1* the order of the Treasury designating what funds were receivable, and not sufficient time afforded to make the Order generally known, in consequence of which a number of purchasers came unprepared with the proper mony—2* the recent Treaty by which the State of Georgia acquired a large tract of country from the Creek Nation,” prevented very many people of that state from emigrating until after that land shall be disposed of by lottery, and their land mony is held up with a view of speculating on those lands—3°
The generally entertained opinion, that the Tallahassee lands would sell unreasonably high, deterred many of limited means from attending the Sale, and lastly may be assigned as prominent reasons the scarcity of mony and limited time for the examination of the country after the removal of the Indians, who manifested ill blood to the last moment of their stay—
I found it necessary, from information received just before the Sale to Suspend from Sale, the fractions on Lake Mickasuky in the fourth Range, and have ordered a resurvey of them, by the Deputy Surveyor who first ran them out—I have directed a Diagram of the Surveys last made to be forwarded to me as soon as it can be completed, and you shall be furnished with it as soon thereafter as practicable—
It will contain the largest proportion of good land not taken by private claims, in the Territory, and is destined to sell well, particularly that part of it termed the Chipola Country—The country west of Tallahassee will be thoroughly examined by persons wishing to purchase, * Christopher C. Stone.
<pb#298/>
whilst the country East will not at present be much looked at: I
would therefore suggest that the next sale embrace the country west which has been sectioned as far as the Chocktawhatche—
The 7" Range West embraces the Appalachicola above the Parralel, and is yet to Section, owing to that River having been without its banks during the winter & spring—I shall have it completed early this fall, together with an extention of the surveys to the true boundary between Georgia and Florida. The 1* and 2** Townships of the Ranges respectively, between Appalachicola & Chocktawhatchee, &
north of the parralel, have not been sectioned, owing to the undefined boundary of a large claim of Inneraritty's lying South between those riverS-
I propose for your consideration the Survey of six thousand miles during the next season, which will comprise the finishing of some work left from high waters and completion of contracts lying East & West of Tallahassee and the Townshipping of West Florida and such sectioning contiguous to the late Survey as may not be interfered with by private claims.
I will thank you for your approval of this estimate, or such other as you may think proper to adopt at an early day, to enable me to commence the Surveys somewhat earlier than November—
I took the liberty of requesting you in my last letter,” to have the Check for my Sallary Accounts inclosed to me at this place, payable to the Eastward, which I hope you had the goodness to communicate—
I am very anxious to arrange my business to enable me to remove my family early in the ensuing fall, and trust I shall be enabled to effect it without serious loss—
I have the honer to be, very respectfully Yº M* Ob S*

The citizens of the counties of S' Johns and Allachua have for the last three weeks been agitated with apprehensions of Indian hostilities, originating in report from the Agency and actively circulated—My own Individual opinion has ever been, that the Florida Indians feel too sensibly their weakness to deliberately hazard an open rupture with the U States, yet the feelings which have been exhibited of late by a few young warriors on a supposed injury received, and the restless disposition existing from the unsettled state of most of the savages, arrising from their very recent removal within limits to which they have never been perfectly reconciled; may possibly lead to secret individual outrages, and to depredations upon the stocks and fields of the White neighbours in Allachua; irregularities which will ultimately involve more extended hostilities—To guard against these possible private aggressions; and their consequences: no policy would be more effectual than the establishment of a temporary military Post at or near the northern line of the Indian and in advance of the White settlements *—The presence of a force in that quarter, if but consisting of but a single company, would overawe the savages, restore confidence to the present Inhabitants, weak in numbers, and encourage into Allachua a further emigration of Enterprising citizens sufficiently powerful to defend themselves, and willing to inflict exemplary punishment upon those Savages who may be mad enough to invite hostilities—A conviction of the beneficial results to be anticipated from the establishment recommended, and a deep interest felt in the tranquility & security of the present settlements in Florida have alone prompted me to volunteer the above suggestion to you with a hope that it may meet with your approbation—The Citizens of Allachua will sensibly acknowledge any relief which the condition of the Army will enable you to extend, and the Territory generally will feel the
<pb#300/>
beneficial results of a policy so well calculated to advance its destinies hitherto retarded by a series of embarrassments and revolutions *—

NAVY DEP'MT. 14. July, 1825.
J. W. SIMONTON, Esq. Baltimore.
SIR, I received your letter of the 29th. June," and should have given an earlier answer, if it had not been necessary to make some inquiries upon the subject, which occasioned delay.
It is always desirable to avoid collision between the public force of the country, and the private claims of citizens; and when injuries are committed by the former, promptly to redress them.
The complaints heretofore made against Commodore Porter, and now against Commodore Warrington, are difficult of examination, from the absence of the necessary information. I have as yet been able to investigate them only by the documents you have furnished, and by an explanation from Commodore Porter. The result thus far, is not precisely that which you seem to anticipate.
The title to Thompson's Island is considered as having passed to the United States with the purchase of Florida. The title to, as well as sovereignty over all the lands in that Territory, vested in the United States, except in cases where individuals had acquired previous to the purchase, a fair and legal title to particular portions of the soil;
and this title they were bound to shew against the prima faciae right of the Government. To enable them to do this, Commissioners were appointed to adjudicate their claim; and until they were decided in their favor, the Government has felt at liberty to use the property, according to its necessities.
When our officers were ordered to occupy Key West, they found the title to it disputed.—With this controversy they had nothing to
<pb#302/>
do. It was their duty, under the orders of the government, to use the Island, so far as it should be necessary for their accommodation.
It is possible, that in doing this, they may sometimes have pressed on the convenience and interests of individuals; but it is to be hoped not intentionally, nor unnecessarily.
Your wish however upon the subject, shall for the present be gratified. Com. Warrington has been ordered to make a temporary, if not permanent removal of the forces from that Island, and to place whatever property shall be left there, in a state of safety.”
He will doubtless be able to do this, without further inconvenience to yourself, or others; and shall receive directions to avoid, as far as possible, all cause of complaint.”
I am, respectfully, &c.

<docbody>Dr SIR, I have the honer to acknowledge the receipt of your letter under date 23% ult” ” in answer to mine of the 4* same month.”
My wishes have been met by the receipt of the Treasures draft on New York, for which I thank you—
Permit me to request that I may be furnished with the precise amount to be included in the Salary accounts for my clerks, in the two succeeding quarters, to embrace the appropriation of the last session—The amount remaining to be drawn, will be found after deducting the sums paid in the year 1824 and the two preceeding quarters; the former of which I have no recollection of and the duplicates of the Accounts are in florida—
Your wishes shall be promptly met with regard to the boundary lines of Townships with a view to the connection of the public surveys;
& whilst on this subject I deem it proper to inform you that in giving my instructions to the Deputy Surveyors, with respect to the running of Township lines only where the land is poor and unsaleable, I have uniformly given the words of the law on that subject for their government—I have been often called on for my opinion of what properly constitutes “a body of poor, unsaleable land", which, under the act of Congress is only to be township"—I have uniformly answered that I did not feel myself authorized to give construction to the law, but at the same time, If I were authorized, I should think its provision fulfilled, when there should be found a sufficient quantity of land within a township, that would sell, or be entered: to pay the surveying of said Township, believing it to be the wish, and policy of the General Government to give as dense a population to Florida as possible, and I am constrained to believe from actual demonstration that a large proportion of the pine lands in Florida are destined to yield independance to the industrious Husbandman.
The opinions of my Surveyors (I believe generally) founded on their own observations, induces the belief that there is not a Township in Florida that will not pay for its surveying—I shall be happy to receive, what your experience and better judgment may suggest on the foregoing subject—The estimate made in my last if desirable, can be extended by surveying East of the Suwannee without interfering with private claims (as I believe) until we near the Alachua Settlement—The limits suggested for a land sale in my last, without the necessary reflection as to quantity; will embrace as much land as
<pb#307/>
can be brought into market in two sales, within the period prescribed by law—
My family being numerous and the larger portion of them helpless, I would much prefer moving by water and therefore deem it necessary to inform you that there is some uncertainty as to the period when the waters afford steam boat navigation and that I might possibly be delayed until the 1* of December in this country—If this arrangement is incompatible with the public interest, you have only to intimate it, as I have ever made it a sacrd duty to sacrifice private wishes to public good—

<docbody>D. SIR Four days since I received your communication of [MS.

Register of the land office at this place. the office with its books and appurtenances was turned over to me on yesterday and duplicate receipts given to the late Register therefor It was omitted at your office to put in a form of the bond required and none came. I however upon taking charge of the office entered into a bond which General Call thinks substantially good I qualified]
and had it certified theron according to instructions] but in consequence of the absence of the Judge who] is in Virginia and likewise the attorney who resides at Pensacola and will not be here unt[ill fall the necessary certificate in regard to the sſolvency of the Security could
<pb#308/>
not be endorsed on it. I have thus entered upon the discharge] of the duties of the office and will forward on [my] bond as soon as the proper certificate can be [objtained on it meantime if you think proper [MS.
torn] might forward a form such as you intended to] have sent at first which can get here by the time the attorney or the Judge will be in place as we have now a mail, in the mean time I have deposited the bond with the Receiver. this seems to be all that could have been done uſnder] the circumstances and I hope for the time being will be deemed satisfactory “
There is much solicitude expressed in the ol{d} Settlements in this district in regard to the time when the lands in their quarter will be brought into market and it is a matter which interests them on the score of getting their funds ready of a proper Kind which is very difficult here. It is with diffidence that I venture to suggest anything to you in regard to the sale of these lands, but as I can See no evil that can possibly result and possibly some benefit may result, both to the government and the settlers in this country I hope it will not be deemed amiss and you can take it for what it is worth. From my observation made in a residence of nine months and the experiment made in the late Sales I am convinced that it is not the best policy to bring the unsettled parts of the district into market first for it has the effect to throw a large proportion into the hands of men who purchase to sell again at a higher price to emigrants and both the treasury and the emigrants loose by it. it is true there was a necessity for selling the unsettled lands around the Seat of government, else the Chipola tract of Country would have presented itself first for disposal Were I permitted to suggest a plan for bringing in the remaining lands of this district which I thought best calculated to benefit the treasury and accomodate the Settlers efinit. it would be to bring into market twice or three times a year a reasonable portion of the best lands, beginning with those best settled. in this way three or four Sales would dispose of all the remaining good lands in this district, after which one more sale of the whole remainder might conclude the business. according to this plan the Chipola lands would first present themselves.” this settlement is three or four years old and is getting into comparatively easy circumsſtances] but dare not make the necessary improvements until [they] own the land, next to that the younger Settlements lying between the Apalachicola and the Ranges lately sold then Holmes" valley and the ajacint tract of country. after which the remainder would comprehend very little good land
<pb#309/>
There is another circumstance connected with this Subject that I
have been very much ſim]portuned to name to you which certainly had a very embarassing effect at the late Sales. the only currency uſsed] to any extent in this whole country is the Georgia and Carolina bank notes and these are not made receivable] in the land office. if there is no solid objection to those] banks the receiving of that money would enable maſny] persons to bid, and to enter lands that otherwise can not owing to their remoteness from monied places where] exchanges could be effected.”

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose herewith my accounts and vouchers for the last quarter contained in three bundles numbered.*—
The Regulations do not provide any allowance for wastages, but believing that a reasonable per centage would be allowed, I have in these accounts charged it, according to the actual deficiency. I
have neither charged or noticed the loss heretofore in any of my accounts, although I knew the constant loss was swelling the deficiency
& causing the accounts to shew more on hand, of fuel, hay, & corn than was really the case.—
I have also in these accounts paid the Carpenters' Bill for work done on the public lot & buildings in Pensacola. About the time I
commenced this work the troops were ordered on the Military Road, consequently there were no Soldiers to employ as mechanics. But as I was authorised to hire citizens to build Bridges on the Military Road, it did not make any difference as to expense whether I employed them on the Buildings or on the road. I therefore trust that my having employed them as I did will not meet with your dissapprobation. The buildings are now in a situation to be useful for a long period with little or no expense; and the rent saved by having them put into condition to be occupied, will, in two years commencing from the 1* of January last, more than repay the expense caused to the Quarter Mrs’: department. Two of the blockhouses have been taken down & removed by the City authorities; and I understand it to be their intention to cause the removal of the remaining two, one of which is occupied as the Custom house. They were all standing in the Streets of the City.—
<pb#311/>
The charge in my accounts for property received from the Road was necessary to the public service, being required for the Service of the troops on their march to Fort Mitchell, & more particularly while stationed there. I therefore thought it better to take teams from the service of the Road where they were not required during the Summer months, than to purchase others; besides it would not have been practicable to make the purchase at the time without causing too great delay. -

<docbody>SIR. The enclosed documents will sufficiently explain the circumstances to which they relate. It will be seen that the deposition of Mº Solano” which led to the military measures adopted was fully corroborated by the return of the three Indians whose disappearance
& long absence had occasioned their threats.-M* Solano is a respectable planter of this territory who has for at least thirty years had intercourse with the Indians, & I have reason to believe, has always been esteemed & respected by them; both from the justice & propriety of his conduct towards them, & the Kindness & protection which they frequently rec" from his Father, whose house, under the former Government, was their constant resort & home on their visits to this City.—M* Solano also perfectly understands the Indian language
& was therefore well able to judge from their conduct & threats, during their hostile visit to his house, that they meditated mischief towards the whites in the event of their not finding their missing companions. His deposition & subsequent removal of his family into town renderd therefore the military precautions unavoidably necessary.—
This communication would have been sent through the proper channel, the hands of His Excellency the Gov" of this territory &

SIR On the night of the 20th Ins' Mº Philip Solana, a planter residing about twenty five miles north of this City (Diego Plains)
called to inform me that Six Indians with their Rifles had been at his house to demand of him three Rifles which they Stated he, Solana, had in his possession belonging to three Indians who were missing, and whose families, they Said, were then crying for their loss, that the Indians entered his house in a threatning attitude, and Said, at the time they parted from him, that they would revenge themselves, if they did not find the Indians, they were in quest of.
I instantly went with Solana to the Judge of the Superior Court of this District and requested him to make affidavit of the facts before the Judge, which he did, at about 10 oclock that night—I
then took the affidavit, and in company with the Judge presented it to Major W* Wilson, who, very readily, offered a Detachment of his Troops (declineing any other aid from me than the necessary Guides and Interpreters) to endeavour to overtake those Indians previous to their putting any of their threats into execution.
The expedition left this, with the expressed intention however, to prevent mischief by the mildest means Suited to the object, and having Soon overtaken the Indians, the following morning, an advance guard got up with them, which, it is Said was received by the Indians as friends, but at the Interpreter, a negro well known to them, who was with this advance, having been ordered not to speak, the Indians and Hernandez notified Murray (24) that the militia would be discharged. The next day he issued a general order (25) praising the actions of the men and on July 12 (26), he enclosed all of the documents to Maj. Gen. Edmund P. Gaines who commanded the Eastern Department.
<pb#314/>
were alarmed by his Silence, and Seeing the main body of the Troops approaching, at once, Suspected the intention of the expedition and Suddenly attempted to Seize their arms; in this, they were prevented, with the exception of two of them. At this time a Pistol was fired, when the Indians fled precipitately: this, together with the report of the Pistol, caused the body of the Detachment to open the fire upon them, with, what effects, I cannot Say at this moment—
I have understood that a party of Indians were Seen crossing the river Sº Johns, and that one of them had his arm broken and that he Said it had been broken by a Shot fired by one of the expedition, had any lives been lost I Suppose they would have mentioned that also. —
Lieu" Alberty, the present commanding officer of this Garrison, has Sent out an express to the Indian Sub-Agent M* Gary, explaining the cause of the expedition, and desireing him to State to the Indians that the four Rifles which were taken from them, would be returned, and for the injury they had Sustained, if it has not been produced by their own misconduct, every proper Satisfaction Should be made.
I have ordered the Commanding officers of the 2* and 4*, Regiments of my Brigade to let me know what number of men each can furnish from their Regiments, in the event that this unpleasant affair Should make it necessary to bring any part of the militia under my command into the field—
The express Sent to the Sub-Agent will probably be here tomorrow, when you will receive further intelligence on this Subject—.

By order of Brigadier General Hernandez The Staff Officers of the
2* Brigade and of the 2* Regiment of Florida Militia assembled at the Head Quarters of the Brigade on the 6* day of July 1825. When the General informed the Council that Indian hostilities were apprehended that he had in consiquence ordered a Detachment of thirty men and one Subaltern from one hundred men already under orders of the Second Regiment of Florida Militia, if a sufficient number of Volunteers did not offer—He also Stated to the Council that Col.
Murray had reported to him that thirty eight men had Volunteered to go upon any Service under command of persons elected by themselves, 
<pb#315/>
and that the thirty Men and one Subaltern were ready as directed for Serviee duty—
There being no law of the Territory authorizing the General to accept the Services of the Volunteers named, he asked of the Council whether in their opinion that either policy or expediency required of him to accept their Services in the manner in which they were tendered—
Whereupon it was Resolved that in the opinion of the Council that desireable as the Services of the Volunteers Would be under existing Circumstances, no law exists which authorizes the General to accept them, and that the Militia as directed to be organized by law must be looked to for protection from the threatened aggressions of the Indians—

SIR. The Indian hostilities with which we were lately threatened the rumour of which has doubtless reached you, and the Serious aspect which the danger assumed from the Agent's Sending to demand Military aid from the comm’ of the U States Troops at this Post rendered it necessary to me to organize a portion of the militia of my Brigade to be held in readiness to Succour if required the Regulars who were Sent out or to meet any further emergency that might arrise.—I
accordingly issued orders to Col: Murray to make a draft of one hundred men from his Regiment and to detach thirty of those for immediate Service—As the draft fell chiefly upon the old or Spanish and Menorchan Inhabitants of the place, who were dependent upon their daily exertions for Subsistence and whom I deemed it a point of policy to inspire with alacrity in the performance of their duties and to familiarize them with the provident details of the militia System by Shewing them that they would be provisioned and taken care of when called into the Service of the United States—I have ordered rations to be issued to them from the time of their receiving arms which was on the 8” Ins' expecting to receive Satisfactory intelligence from the Agency on this night or tomorrow, the expence incured will be but triting, while the advantage of giving this portion of the militia who were Strangers to the nature of our Service, such an insight into its

on future occasions, are I hope considerations Sufficient to justify the measures I have taken and that this course will meet with the approbation of your Excellency—On the first intelligence of the apprehended hostilities I Sent Mº Dexter who is acquainted with and has the Confidence of the Indians to assertain their dispositions, and real intentions; and from the report he made on his return was induced to believe that nothing of a Serious nature was to be anticipated—It was Subsiquent however to this that Col: Humprys made a demand upon the commander of this Post for assistance, upon which, I again Sent M* Dexter as an express to the Agency and expect this night to receive his report, and doubt not that it will prove Satisfactory and evince that no danger is to be apprehended from our borderers, and whose weekness and dependent Situation preclude the possibility of their Seriously, attempting hostilities.—I should State to you that a volunteer Company of 38 men officered by an election among themselves tendered Col: Murray their Services on the occasion but their being no law of the Territory authorizing the reception of their Services I
with the advice of a Council of my Officers declined receiving them under my command.—I found also that many of them with were persons on whom the Militia Drafts in any further emergency Would fall, and understood that many of them had expressed a want of Confidence in the Officers regularly appointed, and had given this as a reason for, prefering the volunteer Service, a proceeding which plainly tended to insubordination, and was calculated to bring the existing Militia establishment into Contempt—This consideration and the want of defined Authority to receive the Services of Volunteers Officered by themselves Will, I hope, Sufficiently justify the course I have pursued—
I have extended orders to the Col: Comm” the 4* Regiment to hold himself also in readiness in case of its being necessary to make any call upon him—
The expence incured in rationing for a few days the thirty men I
have ordered under arms will, I presume, be defrayed without hesitation by the Territorial Gov' I shall therefore take the liberty of mak” a Draft upon your Excellency for the amount when the accounts of the Contractor Shall be rendered me—I thus Sir, detail you the measures which I felt myself called upon to pursue during the late alarms, and trust that they will meet with the approbation of your Excellency—
I have the honor to be With due Respect Your very Obt Serº

In May last a letter which had been addressed to the Sec’ of War, by an Officer of the U. S. Army stationed in the vicinity of Tampa Bay,” was ref" to this Dep" the object of which was to procure an alteration in the direction of the correspondence maintained by &
with the Military detachments on the Western Coast of E Florida.
The writer of that letter complained, that letters destined for that quarter were sent from Washington to Pensacola where they sometimes lay 3 months for want of a Conveyence to Tampa Bay—which when, it chanced to be afforded, was sure to be tedious & unsafe. He suggested that all this correspondence should be forwd" in the first instance to Sº Augustine, & thence despatched by expresses under the direction of the War Dep" to Tampa Bay. This course appeared to direct, plain, & judicious, & its adoption was recom" by this Dep"
in a letter to the Secy of War.” It is probable from y' letter that it has been determined on & therefore it is proper that in future you discontinue returning packets directed to Tampa Bay, by way of Savannah to Pensacola. You will report, upon receiving this letter, whether a line of expresses to pass once a fortnight, has not been established by the military Officers—& if not, whether such an arrangem" might not be easily effected by y'self. The Cont' is in no case to leave any part of the mail. If its increase of bulk require the employm" of a 2" horse, a fair allowance will be made him upon satisfying the Dep" of the fact.

SIR, Your letter of the 24* of July,” has been received & has been referred to the 1* Auditor with a request, that he will furnish you with the information required in relation to the Salary for Clerk Hire.
By surveying & sectioning large quantities of Land in Louisiana &
Mississippi, before the private claims were finally acted upon, & including much barren piny land, the Government & individuals have been put to great inconvenience & much money has been unnecessarily expended. Your instructions were given with a view to prevent the recurrence of the same errors—The object of the Government, is for the present to bring into market, the lands in Florida, which are entirely exempt from private claims, & which may be most in demand for the accommodation of actual settlers—You will, therefore, take care to have no township sectioned, in which there are private claims—
with respect to poor & unsaleable lands, it is difficult for me with the limited knowledge I possess of the topography of the country, to give precise instructions—The ground assumed by you, that, if there is as much land in a township, as will sell for the expenses of surveying, it ought to be sectioned, is too broad—The object of the Government is to Section no township, or part of a township, for the present, except such as contain a considerable portion of such lands, as will probably sell for the minimum price, & which will be required for settlement, in a reasonable time, with these views the question must be left for you to give such instructions to the Surveyors, as your better information, in relation to the various descriptions of soil, their products & the demand for each description, may enable you to do—After all much must depend upon the judgment, discretion & integrity of your Deputies*—

<docbody>SIR I have the honour herewith to enclose, transcripts from the accounts in the books of my Office embrasing all the transactions of the quarter ending the 30” June 1825.” I regret that the want of a safe conveyance has prevented me from forwarding these accounts at an earlyer period. The injudicious arrangements, and the ultimate failure of the contractor for the transportation of the mail, has rendered this mode of conveyance too uncertain to be relied on, and I
much fear that may of the communications which I have made to your Department have not been received.
I have been some what at a loss to determine what is required of me under the following article of my instructions, under date of the
28th of Feb 1825.” “On the last days of March, June, September, and December the accounts in your Ledger must be closed agreeably to the [MS. torn] prescribed by the last five entries in the Journal and transcripts from these accounts in your Book must be sent to this Office quarterly for examination.
My Books have been elesed brought up agreeably to the foregoing instructions, but I have had some doubts with regard to the propriety of the form in which the “transcripts” from the accounts is made, though I have been unable to adopt a better one. The reason why I have entertained doubts on the subject is that most of the information contained in the “transcripts” of accounts for the quarter, has already been given in the several monthly returns embraced within that quarter, and therefore appears to be unnecessary. I however forwarded them for your information, and shall be happy to learn as early as possible your approval or disapproval of them.
The Salary account of M* Overton for his services as Register has been corrected, and he has been allowed his Salary from the period of his having qualified in Office. His bond having been forwarded to your Department we have [MS. torn] the pre (MS. torn] day, but I
believe it was [MS. torn] what earlyer than the time for which Salary is charged.
Owing to a mistake the receipts of M* Overton for his Salary were taken from the 1* of June until the 23° of July, the time when he was relieved in Office by his successor M' Ward,” instead of their being two receipts one ending on the 30° of June and the other on

<source>[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS"]</source>
<place-time>CHARLESTON Sº C 20th August 1825</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In my previous communications to you " I have reported the obstacles encountered, the sickness and death which afflicted my party, and the disasters generally which attended my first operations, in surveying the route of a road from St Augustine to Cape Florida—
After having, under complicated embarrassments, penetrated to the Sº Lucie river, two thirds of the distance contemplated, disease in my camp rendered my party unfit for active service and compelled me to retrograde to the settlements on the Tomoka—Having reorganised my Corps my second efforts were attended with more success, and I
now report to you in detail the result of my labors and observations in the performance of the duties of the commission received from the Department over which you preside—
The country south of Sº Augustine to the very extremity of the promontory of Florida is alluvial and has been formed by successive encroachments on the Atlantic—A chain of inlets or sounds and fresh water lakes extend north & south for the greater part of the distance, seperated from the ocean by a narrow barrier of sea beach and sand hills, and communicating with it at intervals by contracted & shallow entrances—On the west of these inlets and lakes is a parallel chain of sand hills from 4 to 4 of a mile wide intersected by inconsiderable pine flats and oak hammocks; the western base of which is washed by another succession of smaller lakes or saw grass ponds and swamps occasionally connected with each other by natural canals—To the
<pb#322/>
west of these ponds commence the pine planes and saw palmetto flats common to low latitudes, varying in the character of their surface and elevation, and more intersected by grassy and cypress ponds as you descend south, untill they are lost in communication with the Ever glades, or submerged flats of the Cape spotted with small islands of pine, palmetto &c—Immediately west of these pine planes is an immence grassy savannah innundated the greater part of the year, and forming the sourse of the river S' Johns—This great basin receiving the overflowings of all the interior swamps and ponds, branches to the East and West, and discharges its accumulated waters by many minor streams which disembogue into the Atlantic ocean & Gulf of Mexico—It is an inexhaustible Reservoir, tributary to almost all the rivers which intersect & flow through the promontory of Florida—Those on the eastern coast and which are among the principal obstructions to the opening of a road to Cape Florida, are the Tomoka, Spruce, Elbow, Crane, Turkey, S' Sebastians, Sº Lucie, Jupiter, Rio Seco, Middle, New, Ratones and Miami Rivers—The route of the road surveyed is on the pine lands described as laying between the sand hills & second chain ehah of minor lakes or ponds on the east, and the great basin of the Sº Johns west, untill opposed at Jupiter inlet by the ever glades, and from thence on the sand beach of the ocean as the only practicable land communication with the Cape—The beach at low tide is spacious and firm, and the lakes, sometimes approaching within 60 and never receeding more than
230 yards from the ocean, furnish an abundant supply of fresh water— An attempt to penetrate by the ever glades proved unsuccessful; the whole surface of the earth was covered with water from 4 & 5 inches to 2 and 3 feet in some places—For two days my party waded thro these submerged flats and with the greatest difficulty could a spot be found sufficiently extensive and free from water, for dry it was not, on which to pitch our tents—On the last night we had to elevate our blankets from the water which flowed beneath our bodies, with sticks palmetto leaves &c.—The route blased crosses the streams, which have been enumerated, at points where they are fordable or where they present facilities for ferries or bridges—and ferries will be only necessary on the Tomoka, Sº Sebastiens, Sº Lucie, Middle & New Rivers—A more eastern route so as to edge the western base of the Second chain of sand hills, which have been noticed, would present the best ground for a road, and many of the difficulties on the route marked, from ponds flats &crequiring causewaying, might be avoided–
But in this case greater labor would have to be encountered in removing an impenetrable growth of scrubs palmetto &c and more ferries become necessary over rivers of no inconsiderable magnitude—
Thus Elbow, Crane and Turkey Creeks which are but minor streams
<pb#323/>
and fordable were crossed by the road are in less than one mile to the east swollen into rivers of 80 and 100 yards wide with deep and precipitous banks, while the S* Sebastians and Sº Lucie the one about 25 and the other 80 y” wide at the points designated for ferries, nearer their mouths widen into rivers of a half and of a mile in extent—These difficulties however would not weigh in consideration with the superior character of the ground otherwise obtained, if the country was such as to encourage a hope of the frequency of travelling or the density of population ever presenting sufficient inducements to Individuals to keep up ferries at the points designated—the whole country south of the Moschetto offers but feeble allurements to an agricultural population, and this opinion is somewhat strengthened by the fact of their being no evidences within that distance of old Indian settlements, Scattering hunting camps alone indicate the purposes to which that district had been hitherto appropriated—The only land fit for cultivation is on the immediate margins of the rivers or inlets, inconsiderable as to extent, and of a light sandy soil, bearly sufficient to raise the ordinary subsistence in grain for small families whose energies may be directed to other than Agricultural objects—The resources of this Southern district of Florida are limited to ranges for Stock of Cattle, to wrecking and the fisheries, objects in themselves opposed to a dense population, and only inviting to that class of adventurous emigrants who attach little value to roads, and would prefer in their neighbourhood communications making use of those water channels and—lakes provided by nature—These channels are in the chain of inlets and lakes which have been noticed as extending with but partial interruptions the whole length of the coast from Sº Augustine to Cape Florida—Thus the waters of the Mesehełłe-er-Halifax-abbreaeh-within:8-miles—ef Metanzas flowing into Sº Augustine Harbor and those of the Moschetto or Halifax approach with 8 miles of each other, while the southern extremity of the Latter are seperated from those of Indian river by a narrow isthmus of less than one mile in width—Indian river in the high waters is connected by a natural canal with a large lake south, which with very inconsiderable labor may be made to communicate through the Rio Seco and Middle, with New River discharging into the Atlantic only 20 miles north of Cape Florida—
But by only opening the communication, by a canal through a low level surface requiring no locks, between the Matanzas & Moschetto or Halifax and the latter inlet and Indian river, a distance of but 9
miles, a safe inland communication along the eastern coast of Florida from Sº Augustine south for upwards of 200 miles may be secured to the country;-the benefit of which may be extended north as far as Charleston Sº C by another canal of about 10 miles in extent, 
<pb#324/>
uniting the waters of the North River with those of the Sº Johns—
Connected with this imperfect general sketch of that portion of the eastern section of Florida which has come under my observation in the survey of the road assigned me, I subjoin a more minute description in divisions of the whole distance according to the variety of character in the country, with a geographical sketch estimate of probable costs of construction of roads &c."—
—Description—
From Solanos Ferry west of St Augustine by the route of the old Kings road to Tomoka 44% miles—For the first 25 miles generally flat pine lands untersected by three creeks, Moultrie, Three Runs, and Mill, the first about 15 feet wide and easily bridged; the second from swamps on both sides intersected by small branches about 200
and the third about 70 yards wide—Within the same distance 5 old causeways, the whole not exceeding 250 yards in extent will require repairing—The last 9% miles to Tomoka sandy black jack, scrub &
spruce pine ridge, occasionally diversified with pine flats and spotted with small ponds, and intersected by nine smallcreeks running to the east and from 15 to 25 feet wide, all easily bridged—Tomoka river about
45 yards wide and favourable for a ferry, high bluffs on the south and marsh on the north bank with an old causeway about 200 yards wide and easily repaired—The situation owned by Mº Andeson who resides on the spot and willing to establish a flat for the accommodation of Travellers so soon as the road can be opened—From Tomoka to Spruce Creek 15 m 32 c-crossing near the Tomoka a small branch tributary to the same—Level pine lands interspersed with saw palmetto flats, and low wet grassy planes with scattering growth of dwarf pine Trees, occasionally spotted with Cypress ponds and swamps—The greater part of this distance will require causewaying— From Spruce Creek to Indian River 33 m 76 c-Spruce creek, including the Cabbage tree and hammock margins which are subject to overflow and will require causewaying, is about 200 yards wide—The first 10 miles low wet pine saw palmetto flats interspersed with Cypress ponds and grassy planes, converted from their lowness after heavy rains into ponds—For the next 6 miles cypress swamps and saw grass ponds diversified occasionally with saw palmetto & baybush flats—
These are the sources of Indian river and unavoidable as extending west and communicating with the Savannahs & tributaries of the S‘Johns river—The last 7 miles pine and saw palmetto planes singularly spotted with saw and flag grass ponds and occasionally diversified

with Sea Sand hills, and pine land swells, with an undergrowth of broom grass; their superior elevation only detected by their comparative dryness—The greater part of this distance will require causewaying, and the labor in rendering practicable for wheel carriages a road through the cypress swamps, heads of Indian river, will be considerable.—
Ridge of Indian river 23 m 40 c-For one half of this distance high ridged diversified with sea sand undulations & occasionally indented with ponds—The last half, level pine lands comparatively dry, spotted as usual with ponds—To Elbow Creek 15 m 40 c-to Crane Creek
9 m 40. To Turkey Cr—11 m 10 c to S' Sebastians 5 m 20 c To S* Lucie 34 m 55 c the whole distance 76 m 5 c.—generally pine planes diversified with occasional swells of saw palmetto lands and interspersed with grassy flats spotted with Cypress and bay ponds—A
large portion of this distance will require causewaying, the base however being sand a solid foundation for a road may be obtained—
Elbow Crane & Turkey creeks are narrow from 15 to 20 feet wide where crossed and seldom otherwise than favourable, they may with great facility be bridged—The S* Sebastians, & Sº Lucie are deep with perpendicular banks—the sites however are favourable for ferries, the former about 25 & the latter 80 yards wide—From Sº Lucie to Jupiter River 30. m 50 c The country similar in general character to that just described, the ponds however increasing in number and magnitude, and the dry land scarcer as you descend south—crossing in the distance 4 small streams easily bridged, tributaries to a southern branch of the Sº Lucie—Jupiter river about 35 yards wide subject appearantly to great freshes but may be bridged—
From Jupiter River to Sea Beach 8 m 20 c crossing the canal or communication between the Lakes south and Jupiter inlet north—
A grassy channel about 70 yards wide with a rapid current from the lake, subject to overflowings when the lake is full, though generally fordable with firm sandy bottom—The first 4 miles flat pine lands comparatively dry, the last sea sand undulations—
On Beach—to Rio Seco 35m 15 c.—Middle River 5 m 30 c Mouth of New River 13 m 43 c West point of Bear Cut opposite Cape Florida (bay about 3 miles wide) 20 m 45 c-The whole distance 74 m
48c—The beach at low tide is spacious and firm with the ocean on the east and sand hills and chain of fresh water ponds or lakes on the west sufficiently convenient to furnish to the traveller an abundant Supply of water—The sand hills do not present the naked appearance of more northern latitudes, but are generally covered with grass and Occasionally crowned with a thick overshadowing growth of the Sea or Mangrove grape—From being exposed generally to a wind blowing uniformly from the same quarter, regularity has been given to their
<pb#328/>
figure, and instead of the sea sand undulations common to the North, and the dazling reflection of light from the convex and concave inequalities of their surface, these ridges present the appearance of artificial parapets with their regular scarpes & berms all seemingly sodded with the skill of an Engineer—The Rio Seco has been closed by a sand bar which has formed across its mouth, and similar sandy seals have been placed very recently upon Jupiter & little Matanzas inlets—The whole Atlantic coast of Florida presents evidences of these struggles between the sands set in operation by the agitations of the ocean, and the currents of the rivers, the one striving to close and the other to maintain an outlet for their waters—
Middle river is now fordable at its mouth, and a sand bar, forming across the New River, has already diminished the depth of water at its entrance to less than 4 feet—Middle river will more than probable suffer the fate of the Rio Seco, Jupiter &c, and this decrease in the number of the outlets to the lakes, necessarily diverting an accumulated discharge of water through the channel of New River, may alone counteract the operations of the sea on its entrance—

386.71 Miles— 29,700
The above estimate is founded on the labor being performed by soldiers receiving only their extra pay—
Should it be deemed advisable to open the road for the present only to Smyrna, the route of the road marked, will have to be abandoned at the Tomoka ferry and the old Kings road followed or a more eastern route selected so as to cross spruce creek at or near its connection with the Halifax *—The facilities however of crossing this creek from its width & margins of marsh are diminished on approaching its mouth—on the old Kings road there is the remains of a causeway which may be repaired without much labor—I am inclined however to the opinion that the superior advantages of a more eastern route will more than counterbalance any greater difficulties which may be en-
Countered from crossing the creek still nearer its mouth—If the road be opened to Smyrna it may be continued at a very inconsiderable expense, should it be deemed important, along the high ridge of the South Halifax Sound to the Hawlover at Indian River; thus avoiding the bad cypress swamps near the heads of this stream—The great Wedth of Indian river at the Haulover and for many miles above, presenting more the appearance of an inland sea, is the only objection to the selection of this direction for a road to Cape Florida In other respects, for that distance, it possesses a decided preference over the route surveyed & marked—Crossing Indian river at this point however, the road would be continued from thence on the survey which has been made—It may be here necessary to state that I do not consider my blazes as undeviating guides to those who may been trusted with the construction of the road, but as merely designating a line of Operations from which any deviations may be made which subsequent
& more minute examinations of the adjacent country might render advisable—The objects of my commission were more to ascertain the practicability & probable cost of a highway—te way between Sº Augustine & Cape Florida, than to survey and mark every aberation from a
<pb#330/>
direct line which might be necessary to avoid obstacles & for the selection of the best ground—This operation would have required a more minute examination of the whole country than was practicable with the exploring party under my command, and the unavoidable disasters which interrupted our early movements, and can be better performed by the Road makers keeping always in advance & on the flanks of the laborers, a small intellegent examining party—Such was the character of the country in many places, that it was impossible to keep on ground where the road ought to run—A thick impenetrable growth of saw palmetto, bay, scrub & briar bushes matted together, often forced my party to seek a passage through ponds and Savannahs and abandon the higher grounds thus obstructed for the lower lands where the water only had been able to check the luxurient growth of these southern latitudes—
From the detail now furnished, you will be able to form your own opinion as to the cost, practicability & advantages of a road from Sº
Augustine to Cape Florida agreeably to the examination which has been made under an Act of Congress—Whatever differences of opinion may be entertained on the subject to the whole extent, none I hope will exist as to the great necessity of opening immediately the high way south as far as New Smyrna—The route of the Kings road may be selected which will require little more expense than for the repairs of the old causeways and bridges over the smaller branches and creeks—To extend however as much as practicable the benefits of this communication; and to open a passage for Emigrants to the Atlantic as well as western coast of a Territory the populating of which is a policy of national importance, I would suggest to your consideration the propriety of commencing operations at the Sº Marys river, so that the road may branch from Georgia, west to the Bay of Tampa as has been sanctioned by appropriation, and east along the Atlantic border to the extent which may be approved—The immediate operation as far as New Smyrna will be necessarily connected with any subsequent extension of the communication to the Cape which the Government of the US may think advisable and will cost as estimated
11,000 dollars divided thus—
From Sº Marys to Sº Augustine 5000
“. Sº Augustine to Tomoka 4000
“ Tomoka to Smyrna 2000
11,000
The communication to Cape Florida may be extended hereafter either by opening and improving the inland passage by the lakes & sounds which have been described or by the road which has been surveyed—
For the accomodation of any population which may be induced to
<pb#331/>
settle south of the Moschetto the inland communication would be preferable; and I am inclined individually to the opinion it would even prove so for all military defensive operations which events might render necessary—A road sufficiently practicable for rapid military movements and for the necessary unimpeded transportation of heavy ordance baggage waggons &c south of Smyrna could not be constructed but at a cost greatly exceeding the estimate which has been furnished, with a continued annual expence to keep it in a proper state of repair—
The population on the route will probably never be sufficient to contribute to this important object; while the inducements to Individuals to keep up the necessary ferries will scarcely ever be adequate—
This communication contains however, only the hasty observations and speculations of an Individual on a country made under many unfavourable circumstances—However just may be his inferences from the existing state of things as to the uncertainty of the immediate concentration of a population south of the Moschetto it is not improbable that the improvement in the science of agriculture, now attracting general attention, and the discovery of some new southern staple, the unknow value of some native production with the successful introduction of fruits tropical & European adapted to a climate Supplying the difficiences of a light sandy soil, connected with the inexhaustable reservoirs of valuable fish, extensive ranges for cattle, and a sea beach annually enriched by the misfortunes of the enterprising; may as these combined objects of fruit fish, Stock and wrecking, under a mild & salubrious climate present strong allurements to emigrant adventurers and particularly to a class of Citizens whose capital being tonage; and where ploughing is confined to the deep, may convert Cape Florida and the Coast into a Southern nursery for Seamen—The object therefore of opening a communication to the Southern extremity of Florida whether by the inland passage noticed in this communication, or by the road which has been surveyed will it is hoped be steadily held in view as connected with those great internal national works now attracting general attention & which have become identified with the most approved policy of the Republic.”

<docbody>SIR. I have the Honor to suggest that the runing and marking of the Northern Boundary of the Indian Territory; is highly desireable in order to enable me to show a Line of demarkation to the white settlers, who are already thronging to the Vicinity of the Indian Settlements; and some as I apprehend have taken positions near to if not south of where the line will necessarily run; and will I fear if not Expelled become troublesome and create disturbance among the Indians, They are Squatters upon the public Land, and of course Liable to be removed at the instance of the government, whenever it Shall Direct, I should be glad of instructions upon this subject—I take the Liberty to recomend as a Suitable person to be Employed to run the remaining Indian boundary Major Joshua A.
Coffee of this Territory—He is County Surveyor of Alachua County, his residence is convenient to the Agency, he is ready to undertake the work and will I have no doubt if Employed perform it promptly and to the Entire satisfaction of the government, a plat &c. of the Agency Surveyed by him will be forwarded to your Office by the next mail"—

The suggestions contained in yº letter of the 22" ult” ” respecting the route of the Tallahassee mail & the proper point for its connection with the G* & Alab. mail, is so curiously contrasted with those of M" M*Leod, the Cont" for this mail, who designates F* Gaines, &
those of the P. M. at Tallahassee who proposes Henry C* H. that no little difficulty has been experienced in coming to a discriminating &

M. at Tallahassee & the exertions of the Cont" he has employed, will render it at once practicable in the dry season, & that by the time the Winter rains & freshets Commence, the rivers may have been rendered passable by bridges or boats. In regard to the mail establishment you recommend from Tallahassee to Jackson C. h. by Gadsden C. h., that route with its continuation to Pensacola, has been already advertised for proposals.
When Contracts are formed, attention will be paid to the establishment of the intermediate P. Offices, suggested by you.”

<docbody>COL ROBERT BUTLER Surveyor Gen' &c near Nashville Tennessee SIR, On reference to the money advanced to you for Surveying I
find that it exceeds the amount of the estimate made to Congress.
Our estimate was for One hundred Townships to be paid for in the present year and the amount advanced is $40,500 being ten or Eleven thousand dollars more than the estimate. It is not contemplated to have more than two sales in the year 1826. one in the Spring and one in the Autumn, each sale to consist of not more than twenty five Townships, the first sale will I presume include the Chipola Lands and I presume the fifty Townships if well selected will embrace all those parts of West Florida which may be required to be brought into market to meet the demands of the settlers, Emigrants & other purchasers for the ensuing year.”
It is desirable that all the Township lines in West Florida should be completed, so that the private claims may be laid off, whenever they shall be confirmed by Congress, but it will not be necessary to Section off more lands than will be equal to 50 complete Townships annually hereafter in West Florida.
It is desirable that the Lands in East Florida between the Suwannee and Atlantic and adjacent to the Georgia line should be surveyed into Townships and that twenty Townships of the best of these Lands which may be clear of private claims & the most demanded by purchasers should be prepared for sale previous to December
1826. As it is probable that the Surveying of the private claims in West Florida may be commenced as soon in the Autumn of 1826 as the Surveyors can venture to survey it will be proper for you to make Some estimate of the expences for surveying on that account. You will with as little delay as possible forward the Township plats of the Surveying executed and charged in your accounts, as those accounts cannot be settled until they are forwarded.”

The changeable character of the lands in Florida, and the recently discovered value of the pine lands will I am pursuaded render impolitic the existence of the Law which forbids the Sectioning of “a large body of poor unsaleable land” as it leaves a construction so broad that much good land will remain unsectioned from an examination of the exterior boundary of Townships, & the appearance of a difficult swamp may induce a report on the part of the Surveyor that it is usaleable—I have heard that this has been done in Freemans District”—I am informed that the pine lands in the neighborhood of Tallahassee are entering rapidly, and I have no doubt but Florida is destined to sustain a population much larger than its warmest friends have heretofore admitted probable.
I send you contracts for the Survey of 5.400 miles and the residue will be made up, on my return to Tallahassee.”—Unless Congress shall act upon the private claims at the ensueing session, I shall not feel myself authorized to have any work done in 1827. unless specially required by you—

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith, in Compliance with instructions from the Superintendant of Indian Affairs for the Territory; a Plat of the Scite selected for the Indian Agency, together with a plan of a House & an estimate * of the probable expence of erecting it, and the other necessary buildings:–the estimate was made by an experienced practical mechanic; who is well acquainted with all the natural facilities of the place for an undertaking of the kind; he thinks his estimate is full low, and that it will probably fall short of the actual expence.—He has, however, I am satisfied, overrated, and I doubt not, that with the sum named, a Council House, might be erected in addition to the other appurtenances, The importance of having such an establishment (separate and distinct from the private dwelling) for the transaction of public business, is, I trust, sufficiently obvious, to render argument upon the subject, unnecessary:-
The land embraced in the Survey forwarded, is generally (as you will perceive by the map) Hammoc of good quality & well adapted to the more valuable products of the Southern Country, and from the elevated situation of the region immediately surrounding it, warrants the expectation of as much health as falls to the lott of the Territory generally:-The Scite, however, appears most valuable and important as an Agency, on account of its localities; being immediately at the North end of the Big Swamp, or Hammock; in the direct line of communication, between the Indian & White population of the Territory: thus giving in an extensive degree, the power to regulate and controul the intercourse between them, which without the barrier might be carried on to the great detriment of the Indian as well as the Territory; in addition to this, a good water communication, 27 See post, p. 326.
<pb#346/>
with the Atlantic, by way of the Oklewaha and St. Johns Rivers;
may, with small expence, be opened, from the Silver Spring; which you will see laid down on the paper bearing the plat Sent:-This Spring is about three miles from the centre of the plat, and has a Sufficient depth of Water, for all the purposes of large Boat navigation: it was unknown, as I learn, to the white inhabitants of the Territory; until Since my visit to this quarter, for the purpose of locating the Agency; which I should have fixed in the immediate vicinity of it, but for the lack of good land, for cultivation, which according to the understanding I have of the views of the government, in relation to the introduction of improvements in agriculture among the Indians; appeared an indispensable requisite:–I have had an intelligent person employed in examing the water route above named: for the purpose of ascertaining the practicability of establishing a good navigation; and also to procure such information as would furnish me with suitable data, upon which to form an estimate of the expence of removing such obstructions as now exist in the passage. He has, as yet, reported only verbally; but his report favours my most sanguine expectation: & I feel assured, that with the inconsiderable sum of $300 a perfectly good & easy navigation might be opened; which in transportation alone, would save the government, annually, treble that amount; & I should feel a pleasure in receiving orders to make the improvement.—
I take occasion to suggest before closing, that early instruction in relation to building, are desireable, as the Season most favourable for labour, is close at hand.”—

SIR, In conformity with the provisions of the Act of Congress approved 3" March 1825, providing for the preservation of the Public Archives in West Florida; * I inform you that I have proceeded to the translation of a number of Grants derived from the Spanish Government on Record in said office, having relation to Lands granted within the presents limits of West Florida, and also to Lots in the City and Suburb of the same, there being no others of the description mentioned, in the said act.
There are also in my Office documents relating to Lands and Lots, bearing dates from the year 1781, up to 1822.
These are deeds or mesne conveyances passed and executed before the Spanish authorities from one person to another, and recognised by the said authorities; and as the Act of Congress says that, “A
translation and record of all Spanish records and documents shall be made having relation to land claims,” I beg leave to be instructed on the subject, and whether said documents are to be also translated *

[Enclosure]
Abstract of Judicial Proceedings against the Felucca Providencia
[September 6, 1825)
Abstract of the case of the Felucca Providencia, a Spanish vessel, and part of her cargo.
Abstract of Libel.
On the 6* May, 1825, a Libel was filed in the Superiour Court for the District of E. Florida, by the Attorney for the District, against
<pb#351/>
the Felucca Providencia, a Spanish vessel, and ten barrels of Coffee, six bags of Cocoa, two barrels of Rum, and one hundred and twenty nine hides, part of her cargo, for an alleged violation of the 50” Section of the Act of the Congress of the U. States “to regulate the collection of duties on imports and tonnage.”
Abstract of Answer and Claim.
On the 16” of said May, the Answer and claim of Thomas Griffin, Prize master of said Felucca, was filed, claiming said vessel &c. as lawful prize to the Columbian brig El Vencedor, an armed vessel, duly commissioned by the Republic of Columbia, at War with Spain, to capture Spanish subjects and property.
Abstract of Evidence.
On the trial, commencing on the fourth monday of said May, it was proved, that on the 25* of April preceding, the said Felucca was first discovered by the pilots of the river St. John's, near the mouth of said river—that she was, by said pilots conducted into, and anchored in the waters of the Sº John's—that on the 28* of said April, she was found, by an Officer of the revenue, aground, her cable cut, her hatches open, and that part of her cargo, included in the Libel, landed and secreted on shore—& that the vessel and goods, found on shore, were then seized by the said revenue officer. It was also, further proved, that said goods were landed, without a permit, that on the seizure of the vessel, the crew thereof left her, and were no more seen in Florida. That Thomas Griffin the Prize-Master and claimant, before the landing of said goods, had left the vessel, being too sick to continue in charge of her, the officer next in rank remaining on board till after the she was seized, in behalf of the U. States, as aforesaid—It was proved that the articles landed without a permit, were of the full value of $400, at the place where landed.
Abstract of the Sentence and Decree.
On the 10° of June 1825, the Court decreed, on evidence, of which the foregoing is an abstract, that the said Felucca Providencia, her tackle, apparel and furniture, together with the said ten barrels of Coffee, six bags of Cocoa, two barrels of Rum and one hundred and twenty nine hides, be condemned as forfeited to the United States.
The above and the foregoing, is a faithful abstract of the case of the U States versus the Felucca Providencia &c.

<docbody>SIR, I have this day returned from the Survey of the road to Wantons,” I find the distance about one hundre and forty miles, The Country from this to the North branch of the Ouithlacocha river fifty miles, is very low and wet, I had much difficulty in finding a place sufficiently high to bridge that stream after examing for several miles up & down the stream I have found a position where a bridge will rest secure, besides the two branches of this stream the two branches of the Hillsborough river, and Thlo noto Sassa Creek all very considerable streams will require bridges, beyond that the country is generally undulating pine lands, very little will be required but to remove the Timber.
The Country affords no Supplies except a little corn, in the Alachua settlement. All the Supplies must be transported from this place in waggons, and on pack horses, this will be the most difficult part in opening the road. I have made a requisition on Cap" Burch for two more Teams, with Waggons, which will not arrive before the last of October, I shall not wait their arrival but move on by the
10* with what Teams I have.
The funds necessary to pay the men for extra labor, for forage and other contingent expenses will probably amount to $5.000 which
<pb#353/>
I wish forwarded to Cap" Burch at Pensacola as a draft would be useless to me in the woods,-
The expenses of the Survey have been but trifling. I take them up in the accounts for opening the road.

<place-time>FLORIDA AGENCY 30° Sept: 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Enclosed herewith, are my accounts for the two quarters ending 30° June & 30: Sept: the former has been once to St: Augustine, as I presumed it might without difficulty, be forwarded to you from that place; dissappointed however, in this, it was brought back to be Sent to your Office from here—thus much is said in explanation of the delay.—
It will not be possible for me to forward the annuity accounts until near the close of Nov. All my efforts, (which have been many) to induce the Indians, to go to Tampa Bay to receive their goods, have failed & I am at last compelled to haul them to this place, on which service, I have a team now employed. The Indians evince a disinclination to receive the goods; though they have concluded to take them, if brought here; they say they are entitled to their annuity in Money, and that they wish it; and I doubt very much, whether they can be induced to accept a Second Stipend, in any thing else.—There are already numerous petty dealers in Whiskey & other articles, settled near our borders, who will fail (in part at least) of their expected booty, if goods are issued to the Indians, in lieu of Cash, & they it is presumable, will be unsparing in their exertions, to induce the Indians to refuse Goods; indeed the latter have already given me to understand, that they shall expect the next payment in Cash; and have requested me so to say; and whether it would be Politic or just for the Government to disregard their wishes in this respect, is a question certainly entitled to consideration. I am clearly of opinion that
<pb#354/>
good if judiceously laid in, would be of infinitely more service to them, than the small amount to which they are entitled, would be, if paid in money. I am nevertheless, equally clear in the opinion, that it is entirely optional with them, to Say which they will receive—How far it may be proper, or wise, to force their inclination in Such a matter, even with a view to their benefit, is not for me to determine.”
You will notice one Charge in my abstracts for this quarter for Moneys paid for Clerk hire; this expenditure is one for which I
rather ask than claim credit: the accumulated, & I may say extra-
Official duties, which have fallen to my share, for the last few months;
have forced me to the necessity of employing a Clerk; the price of whose hire I cannot doubt will be admitted among my other disbursements—I have written to the Department of War, for authority to remove at the Public expence, the obstructions in a Stream heading near the Agency & communicating with the St. Johns River, by way of the Okelewaha, for the purpose of opening a navigation, that will enable me to procure the necessary supplies for the Station, upon infinitely better terms for the Government than it has hitherto been possible for me to do; “the very great expense of transportation to which we have unavoidably been subjected, will hereafter, if the arrangement proposed, is effected; be, I am convinced more than one half saved; the costs of labor & others incident to the undertaking, will not exceed; it is confidently believed $.300. Treble this amount it is probable would be annually saved in transportation alone. In the event of instructions being received, to consumate the plan I
have suggested, a boat will be a necessary appendage to the Agency;
to purchase which your authority will be requisite. the probable price will be about $.100. It will be seen by my accounts that funds for the Agency are necessary M" Gary who has made his last issues &
is employed to convey my letters to you, will on his return, afford a Safe and good opportunity for sending them to me.—M" Gary I
presume expects while at Tallahassee, to Settle his Accounts with the Government & receive payment for his Services, as issuing Officer, at Hamley's Old Store on the St: Johns. I take occasion to offer the opinion, that his compensation, which I understand has not been fixed, should be liberal, as his duties have been greatly arduous owing to his having been several times called into the Nation to attend to the receipt and averaging of the Cattle delivered by the Contractor &
to the great amount of Issues made at his post. Those duties it is
<pb#355/>
but just to Say, have uniformely been performed with regularity &
correctness.

<docbody>SIR, After experiencing numerous embarassments in my intercourse with the Indians embraced within my Agency, for the want of an inteligent & competent Interpreter; I was induced in June last, during your absence from Tallahassee to direct Mº Marsh, the Sub Agent, (whom I found it necessary to Send to the Creek Agency to confer with Col. Crowell “ on the Subject of Slave property, in dispute between individuals of the two Nations,) to procure one if a Suitable one could be found; and with a view to induce Such an one to engage, I authorised Mº Marsh to Say, that the Same compensation would be given, as is allowed to the Creek Interpreter—On his return to the Agency he was accompanied, by a Mº James Hardridge who offered his Services as Interpreter, upon the terms proposed; I accepted him conditionally that Should the arrangement made with him meet the approbation of the Superintendent, he is to be continued; otherwise to be discharged, on having being paid for the time he Serves at the rate named.
I have only to add the hope that I may be authorized to continue him as I am Satisfied, from what I have Seen of him, that he will answer the purpose, and may be made Servicable. He has I understand a good character for integrity, & he appears to possess a pretty thorough knowledge of the Indian language & character, and as far

as I can preceive, conducts with faithfulness and gives Satisfaction to the Indians.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE October 3° 1825.-</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, Having informed myself as to the shortest practicable Route for the Road from the St. Mary's River to Wanton's I have published proposals accordingly for opening it by contract, a copy of which is enclosed.* The Country through which this Road will pass is low & flat, and will require more labor to open it with proper Bridges & Causeways than I had formerly supposed. I have already ascertained that bids for the contract need not be expected for less than from ten to twelve thousand dollars. I therefore deemed it proper to invite proposals for opening the Road & putting it in practicable travelling order only, as specified in the latter part of the Advertisement. For if the Road is opened in this manner there would be no difficulty in travelling it in the dry seasons, the Streams which it crosses being fordable at such times; and when the rainy Seasons swell the Streams to swimming, Travellers on horseback, and even Carts & Light-waggons, would be able to pass, having good footways over them, almost as easily & safely, though not so expeditiously, as if they were Bridged. The Sum now appropriated is fully adequate for opening the Road in this manner; and for all immediate practical purposes, would I am convinced be as useful as if opened in any other mode. Inasmuch as it would neither interfere with any subsequent contract for completing the Road with its Bridges & Causeways, nor yet augment the expense of finally finishing it; I beg leave respectfully to recommend for your consideration whether it would not be advisable to close a contract for opening & making it a practicable Road without delay; though it ought, in my opinion, to be fully completed in the end, in the same manner as the Road will be from Pensacola to St: Augustine.—It is more than probable that the same person
<pb#357/>
who takes the first contract for opening the Road will also, if it should be required thereafter, undertake its completion on being paid the difference between the two amounts proposed for. I request you will be pleased to instruct me on this subject, addressed to me at Pensacola, in order that I may, if approved by you, be prepared when I
receive the proposals on the 10" day of December next, to close the contract for opening this Road.*—
If it is decided to complete the Road afterwards with the requisite Bridges & Causeways, it will require an additional appropriation of five thousand dollars for completing that part of the Road opening under my direction.”—

In the mean time I would remark, that so far as your Letter relates to your controversy with Mr Crane, it would seem to be a private affair, to the settlement of which the ordinary Tribunals must be competent. The absence of the public functionaries from their Territorial posts, if it is without sufficient cause, is undoubtedly improper;

In consequence of the intelligence contained in yº letter of the 31°

To understand this phrase you have only to suppose a line or route extending 100 miles from E. to West, & the pay on it, according to this Scale of allowance would be $450 prAn. At present it is not expedient, with a view to the existing state of the Country & its comparative demands for mail accomd" to establish a weekly route from Pindartown to Tallahassee.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10* of August last,” by the way of Pensacola.-
I have not as yet made any extra provision for the Emigrant Indians of this Territory out of the two thousand dollars allotted for that purpose, intending to husband it with the utmost economy as a dernier resort, to be used only in cases of absolute necessity:—the Sum is in itself so small as to be of no utility if expended in a general manner.—
Many of these Indians, resident in the Reserve East of the Suwannee River, have recently abandoned their country; and I have received information upon which reliance is to be placed, that most, if not all, of those who formerly resided between the Rivers Suwannee &
Appalachicola are on their return hither. They state to me as a reason for their return, that they have always been furnished with a scanty supply of provisions only & which has sometime since ceased altogether; that they have no means of subsistence within themselves;
that there is no game in their country; that it is moreover exceedingly unhealthy, exposing them to sickness and inevitable death; and in fine, that no part of the country allotted to them for a residence is of
<pb#360/>
such a description as to afford them comfortable settlements; or of such a quality as will enable them either to have stocks or to raise corn. I have myself never been in that part of Florida, but from information that I rely upon, I am inclined to believe that all that the Indians represent respecting its unhealthiness & want of fertility of soil is strictly correct, and requires, in justice to them, to be thoroughly investigated. Many complaints from the Indians respecting their Rations had reached me early in the Spring, and when the Agent was here in May last I informed him of the reports & complaints that had been made to me, all of which he assured me were utterly false & without foundation.” I then pressed earnestly upon him the absolute necessity of his paying an immediate & particular attention to tranquilizing the Indians; of endeavoring to dispose them to form permanent Settlements on the best lands within their Reserve;
and of seeing that they were supplied with provisions according to the means at his disposal; and ended, by directing him to return to the Agency forthwith to carry these objects into effect;-trusting that his personal presence & efforts with the Indians would operate favourably in disposing them to acquiesce in the views of the Government & relieve their distresses. I regret however that I am compelled to State that these complaints and reports still continue in an increased degree; and are urged by the Indians in justification of their abandoning their own country and returning to the vicinity of their late Settlements.-
This district of Country, (formerly in the occupancy of the Indians,)
has been surveyed, in part sold, and is rapidly populating; and if the Indians cannot be restrained within their limits, occurrences of an unpleasant nature between them and the white inhabitants must infallibly ensue:–complaints against them having been already made for depredations committed upon the Stocks of cattle & fields of Corn belonging to the whites. But as Gov" Duval is daily expected to arrive in the Territory to resume the Government thereof, I do not think it either proper or decorous for me to enter at length upon the present situation of the Indians, & their causes of dissatisfaction and complaint, which are both of a local and permanent character;
and will, in my opinion, to be thoroughly removed, require a total change in the measures hitherto pursued towards them. So soon as the Governor arrives I shall make him fully acquainted with their actual situation, & with my views in relation thereto, leaving it to his experience and better judgement to decide what measures will be most proper to pursue towards them; and you may therefore confidently calculate upon being early addressed by him on this subject.
<pb#361/>
I shall however in the meanwhile, do all in my power to restrain their mischievous propensities & compel them to return to their lands.”—

<docbody>SIR. The President having appointed you to the command of the Rev-Cutter Pulaski lately built at Baltimore for the Florida Station;
you will when ready for Sea repair to Key West, and from thence proceed, as often as circumstances will permit, to examine all the Islands, Bays, and Inlets on the West-Coast of Cape Florida as far as the East End of Rose Island, & if at any place during your cruises, you shall find any Wessel or Wessels engaged in illicit commerce, or unprovided with such documents as are required by Law—you will seize such, Wessel or Wessels and send them in charge of an Officer to the nearest Port for adjucation.
As Wessels are frequently wrecked on the Florida-Keys—you are to consider it a part of your duty, if requested by the Master or Supercargoe, to assist in preserving their Cargoes, but if the Wessel &
Cargoe shall have been abandoned by the Crew, you will, after taking on board as much as the Cutter can contain, Ship the Residue on board of any American Wessel, the Cap' signing an obligation to deliver it at such Port as you shall designate. For your further information however on this subject, I have to call your attention to the enclosed copy of an Act entitled “An Act concerning wrecks on the coast of Florida” passed on the 3" of March 1825 *
There being reason to apprehend that great depration is committed on the public Lands in East and West Florida by cutting and carrying away the most valuable part of the timber, you will consider it to be your duty provided the fact can be ascertained by information derived from individuals as are authorized by the Act of Congress, * See post, p. 343.
<pb#362/>
passed on the 1* of March 1817,” of which the enclosed is an extract.
You will also receive herewith the copy of a letter addressed to the Collector of St Augustine & Pensacola of the 23* April 1823 on the subject in question.” As neither Thompsons Island nor indeed any part of the main Land can furnish supplies of any kind. it will be advisable to take 6 months provisions with you, and when those are nearly consumed you must proceed to Mobile, & apply to the Collector, who will be instructed to furnish on your estimate, the funds required to procure supplies and to pay the crew—for which you are subsequently to account to him, as also on your arrival at Mobile for the money advanced to you by the Collector of Baltimore.
The crew of the Cutter exclusive of Officers is not to exceed fifteen men, a cook, steward, and two Boys, and when paid ev'ry man must sign a receipt opposite to his name—on a Pay-Roll certified to be correct by the Cap" and his Officers. It will also be proper that a copy of your journal verified in like manner—should be forwarded to this Office at the end of ev'ry month if opportunitys should offer.
It is also proper to apprize you that without previous approbation of this Department no alterations can be made in the Cutter, nor any expence incurred for objects other than the ordinary supplies, except in the event of the loss of spars, sails, anchors, & cables. It is also to be understood that unless authorized as above stated, the Cutter must not be absent from her cruising ground on any pretence, exceept driven therefrom by stress of weather or, for the purpose of procuring supplies at Mobile.
For your further instruction in regard to your public duties, I have to refer you to the enclosed copy of a circular letter addressed to the Capt's of Revenue Cutters on the 13" July 1819,” and remind you of the absolute necessity, of taking receipts for all disbursements made by you for the use of the Cutter Service, as vouchers upon an adjustment of your accounts with the Collector at Mobile.
I will only further add that as the Officers of Revenue-Cutters, are deemed to be attached to the Customs, a copy of Brice's Revenue Laws will be very useful to you, They were published in Baltimore, & can probably be had in any of the Book stores at that place. The expense of it will be allowed.

<place-time>AMIENS 15* October 1825 Chateau de la Vallée SIR I have the honor to address you on the subject of a claim to land held by me, under the Spanish government in East Florida.</place-time>
<docbody>By the extension, during the last Session, of an Act of Congress entitled “An Act for ascertaining claims to land in the Floridas,” “the Commissioners are required to furnish the Secretary of the Treasury, with a report of the result of their investigation, on or before the 1*
of November next, in order that the same may be laid before the Legislature of the Union for ulterior proceedings thereon.
In November 1817 the Spanish government of East Florida engaged to make me, upon certain onerous conditions, a considerable concession of waste lands,” & the fact of that engagement was one of public notoriety, but the issuing of the grant was delayed until the 26 of feby: 1818 in consequence of my absense at Savannah & Charlston, & waiting my return to S' Augustine;—at that time no injurious consequences were anticipated from the procrastination.
In the ensuing Season my Attorney & cooperator, the late Mr James Alexander (who died in the Province) proceeded to Sº Augustine, with others from New York, to carry into effect the terms of my contract, while I embarked for Europe upon the same object, & in compliance with the conditions annexed tº my concession. Mr to See post, p. 352.
<pb#364/>
Alexander & myself were occupied in these transactions when the preliminary Convention for the cession of the Floridas, of the 19 of feb” 1819," ratified by the United States, was promulgated; wherein by a clause of the 8* Article, of retrospective operation, my grant appeared from its date, to be abrogated, & in the absence of all information as to the circumstances which gave rise to the clause, I was constrained, notwithstanding the apparent injustice of the case, to relax in a great degree, my proceedings under the grant.
In the mean time however, settlements had been commenced, & unwilling to relinquish the equity of my title, were continued on my behalf, by my Agents Mess" Alexander, Mitchel, & Dexter;" at Velutia " on Lake George, & at Vibrillia on the river Sº Johns, by a Mr Dean near Lake Dunn, while a certain number of individuals conducted by a Mr Riz," (now at S*Augustine) were engaged by me in England, to form the nucleus of another settlement. In fact the proceedings under the grant were such as fully entitled me to the protection of the government of Florida, & from the Spanish authorities I possess documentary evidence to support those pretensions.
At the opening of the Session of 1819 the President communicated to Congress a detail of the negotiation,” & stated the cause of the delay on the part of Spain, in the ratification of the convention, which, it may be contended, had ceased to exist, by lapse of time, & the renunciation of its terms, by Mr Forsyth," the Special Minister of the Union at Madrid.
The documents connected with the convention embracing the various correspondence it produced, were laid before Congress, & published by its authority.” Those documents demonstrated the quo animo of the negotiation with respect to the abrogating clause of the 8" Art:, & contained certain pledges, by Mr Secretary Adams, on the part of the United States government, as to his limitation of the abrogation “that the Federal government would most assuredly, never entertain the idea of disturbing individuals who were vested with a boma fide title to their property;-In fact & in truth, the whole of the correspondence respecting the res gesta in the clause was confirmed by the tenor of the Presidents Message in 1819 which declared, adverting to the intended abrogation of the grants, the subject of
<pb#365/>
controversy with the Spanish government “It was the intention of the parties to annul these latter grants, & that clause was drawn for that express purpose, & for none other.”
With the subsequent history of the Treaty you are Sir doubtless acquainted,—The King of Spain ratified its contents in October 1821, but substituted for the obnoxious clause of the 8 Article, a Declaration explaining its original intention but stating that its object had been accomplished in another manner, namely by an especial annulment of the disputed grants.
Notwithstanding this instrument of substitution, which effectually nullified the operation of the clause in the 8 Art.; an Act of Congress was passed in 1821 & 2 constituting a Commission to investigate titles to land in Florida,” & the Commissioners were restricted to the examination of titles preceeding the 24" of Jan’: 1818, & no provision whatever was made with respect to those of a subsequent date. To this omission I had the honor of soliciting the attention of Mr Secretary Adams on the 16 of Jan”: 1823,” at Washington, & at the same time of enquiring whether any measure was contemplated by the Executive for the relief of those whose interests were omitted in the provisions of the Act? Mr Adams replied in the negative, stating that the subject was one peculiarly belonging to the Legislature.”
Combining Sir all the circumstances connected with this case, namely The inception of the grant in 1817, The declared views of the Negotiators in framing the clause of the 8 Art: & of its limited intention, with the language of the Presidents Message in 1819 (professing at least a verbal recognition of my title) together with the impression that the Declaration of the King of Spain must be taken as a substitute for the clause, which remained proforma only in the Treaty, I respectfully submit to you Sir, that I am justified in considering the integrity of my possession unimpeached by the Treaty, & that it is entitled on the contrary to the respect of the United States government.
I have the honor Sir to transmit this to you, as an evidence of my continued pretensions, in case any general measure shall be enacted, during my absence, for the relief of the very few titles affected by the clause, & I shall present myself at the seat of government, so soon as I shall ascertain the final termination of the present Commission; in the mean time I feel confident that the United States will adopt toward me, & those similarly situated, a liberality of conduct consistent with their National honor, & due to the Citizens of a great

Office of the Sup: of Ind:Aff: for Florida—
TALLAHASSEE, October 18* 1825, SIR, Your letter of the 15* Ult” directing the extension of the Indian Boundary lines of their Southern Reserve in this Territory, was received yesterday.”—
In regard to the extension of these lines I have to State that the Agent is under a misapprehension as to the place granted to the Indians, in consequence of which Some of the Indians have as I
understand been improperly located; and which has given rise to his report, alluded to in your letter, that Settlements of Whites were forming within the Indian limits.-In the Alachua (a district of country So denominated,) there are two places which from a partial Similarity of names have been frequently confounded with each other; the one is called the Big Swamp and lies North of, but near to, the Indian Northern Boundary line; the other is called the Big Hammock and lies near to, and West of, the Indian lands. The Agent contends for the occupation of the former under the Presidents order, but an extension of the lines according to that order cannot be made So as to embrace it, and will, when made, include only the latter.—This was fully explained to the Agent while at this place in May last; and Col: Gadsden, who was then also present, demonstrated beyond the possibility of a doubt that it was So intended by the President, who it is evident by comparing his order with the map of Colonel Gadsdens Survey,” thoroughly understood the Subject;
and yet it seems from your letter that the Agent (for he has never thought proper to address me on the Subject nor to inform me of intrusions by White Settlers on the Indian lands,) Still persists in his erroneous construction of the order in question; the only grounds that can be assumed for which is, that in the Presidents order the term Big Hammock or Swamp is used; (in your letter of the 15*
Ulto: it is more definite being called the Big Hammock only;) but then the slightest reference to the manner in which the lines are ordered to be extended leaves not the shadow of doubt as to which of the two is meant.—It is however proper at the Same time to State that the Indians themselves have always contended for the grant of the Big Swamp, and this fact no doubt has measurably contributed to continue the Agent in his error as to the place actually designated for the occupancy of the Indians. And until I had conversed with
7" Ante, p. 318.
<pb#368/>
Col: Gadsden and examined his Map I was myself under an impression that the Big Swamp was the place intended to have been granted.—
As the matter now Stands the Inhabitants of Alachua, Some of whom are Settled near to the Indian Northern boundary line, complain loudly that the Indians are Suffered to locate on lands without the limits of their Reserve; which is, and must continue to be, the fact, unless the President shall be pleased to extend the Indian Boundaries So as to include the Big Swamp.
Col: Gadsden is expected to arrive by the first proximo, & from his having run out these lines, added to his perfect knowledge of the Topography of the Country, I deem it important that he Should now be appointed to extend them and Shall accordingly endeavor to prevail upon him to accept the appointment under the order of the Secretary of War.”

SIR, I have the honor to enclose for your information a Report made to me by M. Doyle respecting the Indians in Florida.” This Gentleman has resided for many years previous to, & since the cession of Florida to the United States, amongst the Indians recently inhabiting this section of the Territory; and is therefore not only acquainted with the Indian character, & dispositions in general, but is know personally to these Indians & their Chiefs. It had become necessary for me to employ a confidential person to endeavor to collect the fugitive Indians at some point, where my message &
orders could be communicated to them; and also to ascertain, as far as practicable, directly from themselves their immediate causes of complaint & their own views in regard to the future. From his personal good character added to these reasons, I deemed M. Doyle to be the most suitable agent I could engage in this business, & he was accordingly employed by me, & will be continued in employment, if necessary, until I am relieved in the exercise of the Gov"
of the Territory by Gov: Duval; or am instructed by the Dept: as to the measures proper to be pursued, which I shall anxiously expect.
In the mean time I have determined, as the only course left to save these Indians from Starvation & the Settlements from exposure to depredations from them, caused only by their necessiteious condition, to place M' Doyle at, or near, the Suwanne River, with the double object of preventing the Indians from entering the Settle-
<pb#370/>
ments of the Whites; and to furnish them with Some Supplies of Corn for their wives and Children.—
I am convinced they cannot be concentrated within their limits without the aid of Military force, unless some means of subsistence be there provided for them, in which case I believe they would comply with whatever might be required of them. From representations made to me on which I can rely, the situation of these unfortunate human beings is miserable in the extreme, & requires prompt &
effectual relief from the humanity, if not from the justice, of the Government; and which I trust will be extended to them.—
If the President shall deem it expedient, I consider the present moment as one favorable for holding a Treaty with the Florida Indians, having for its object their immediate removal to lands West of the Mississippi River, either in a body as a nation by themselves or to be incorporated with the Creek Nation in their contemplated removal. So far as it regards obtaining the consent of the Indians, (not only those in the Southern reserve but of those on the Appalachicola River,) I believe either of the proposed plans to be feasible.—Such a measure would be productive of the most important advantages to themselves, by fixing their location permanently in a healthy & productive district of Country, & in ameliorating their present distressed & dissatisfied condition; and likewise be of incalculable advantage to the interests of the Territory itself—In suggesting, & recommending this measure to the Government, I am confident in the expression of the opinion, that I Speak the views and Sentiments of Governor Duval; and not only of his but those of the most enlightened & intelligent men in the Territory—
Beleiving that this measure if properly pursued will arrive at the happiest results in effecting a more favorable location for these Indians than their present one, I deem it important that in the event of a Treaty being held, it should be conducted by persons having no private interests or feelings to consult, and who are acquainted with the Indian Character & known personally to the Chiefs.”—

<docbody>DEAR SIR Your letter of the 6* of September * came to hand mail before last together with y' circular on the subject of Office furniture.
Your enquiries in regard to the half Section of land adjoining Tallahassee belonging to the Marquis La, Fayette would have been sooner answered only for the indisposition of Gen' Call who has been for several weeks past and is yet confined by severe indisposition we wished to have examined that tract of land together before we wrote but his protracted illness has kept it out of his power. I have examined it as well as the thickets that cover it will permit and find it a valuable piece of land and think it certainly will afford convenience to the inhabitants of Tallahassee to have it sold out in the manner proposed, and I should suppose restricted as they are from using the timber on the reserves near town that it would bring a pretty fair price even at an early period, yet it seems most likely that it would bring more at the time of the next land sale (when it is expected there will be a great deal of money here) than at an earlier period. it lies adjoining Tallahassee in the manner of the reserves and the Street running through the centre of the town Eastward will pass longitudinally through the centre of this half section. for your more entire satisfaction I have requested George T. Ward to subjoin a small platt which will more distinctly show you how it lies. Gen"

<docbody>DEAR SIR Your letter of the 5* of last month * enclosing the form of a bond is received and shall be attended to on the return of Judge Woodward who has gone to the sale of lotts in a town in Chipola.”
Also that of the 9” ” acknowledging the receipt of our monthly return for July also your printed circular respecting office furniture * is recº and your Joint letter to the Receiver & Register * at this place on the subject of the next land sale. I am sorry to tell you that Gen.'
Call is too ill and has been for several weeks to attend to any business I have had two conversations with him on the subject of your letter and he requests me to write you that we entirely agree with your idea that it is the most proper plan to bring first into market the lands most settled and best improved without regard to Contiguity and that according to this plan the Chipola including Holmes" valley certainly has the first claims,” and at his suggestion I have procured from the Surveyors office a platt of that district of country containing twenty four townships and six fr’ Townships binding on the Alabama line, for some reason the fractions on the Georgia line were left unsold at the May sale and perhaps for the same reason those might be omitted which will leave the number of Townships one less than you contemplated selling.
In regard to the time for holding the next sale we beg leave to suggest to you the propriety of making the time a little earlier than you speak of. we think the 10 or 15" of March would be better than a later period. the Season for planting corn & Cotton is in all the months of March April, & May, and if the Sale is as late as April or May the Crops will be planted and in very many instances the planter will be outbid and thrown on the mercy of the speculator or others for his crop. which will be placing him in a very distressing situation at a season too late to raise any provision for his Support that year. this would be avoided by selling these lands in March. the Presidents advertisement will be seen and those whose means are limited can if they choose defer planting until the sale is over and if
<pb#373/>
they were fortunate enough to obtain their settlements they could still plant in good season and if they were outbid there would still be time for them to rent or look out in some other way, for another Settlement. we think there is something like this due to those adventurous pioneers and particularly where it can be done without injury to the treasury. Another reason for having it earlier is that in April and May this country is deluged with rains and the watercourses in Florida Alabama & lower part of Georgia are deep and numerous and as yet there are very few boats or bridges. the same cause in May last operated its full Share against the Sale It will be in the power (ordinarily) of every provident man to have the avails of his cotton in March, we are induced to believe there is a great deal of money ready for the Chipola sale. Gen' Call desires me to make this communication to you and say that it corresponds entirely with his Judgment *

<pb#375/>
The required estimate shall be made and forwarded, together with the return of Surveys lastly executed with all possible dispatch after I reach Tallahassee, for which place I had contemplated setting out in the first week of next month, but owing to a failure (from sickness of hands) on the part of a Gentleman who contracted with me for the building of a carriage for the conveyance of my family, I will probably be delayed until the 15" or 18"
That the contracts for Surveying previous to appropriation, should be conditional I had no doubt, but I did not feel myself at liberty to alter the conditions of the contract it having been furnished me for my guide—As the deputies under the contracts executed have departed some time since for their completion, I shall probably not see them until finished, I shall however write them and obtain by letter their acquiescence in the condition which is now well understood by them—I would however suggest that as soon as the appropriation is made, the funds may be placed in my hands subject to disbursement, as it is the wish of the Deputies generally to attend the next land sale, hence this mony will revert back again immediately—The difficulties suggested in your last letter with regard to compelling the Deputies under the form of contract adopted to pay for incorrect surveying, permit me to say does not exist, for the return of surveyors explicitly states the period in which it was executed, and my individual instructions to each Dep’ (copies of which are on file) point out as near as may be, the ground they are to occupy, and the contract itself requires the work to be executed within a given period, and added to all which I have taken an individual bond of Ten thousand Dollars with good security for the faithful performance of all surveying assigned to each Deputy, under all which there can be no possibility of escape—The latter precaution I have adopted, growing out of a circumstance that transpired (as I have been informed)
in Freeman's office, where returns under contract were regularly made into the office well executed on paper, without a chain ever having been stretched in the district assigned—On the subject of your remark as to the size of the contracts, I have been governed in this particular by a complaint on the part of the Deputies of their inability to make any money under Small contracts from the difficulties of the Country, the scarcity and consequent high prices of supplies, and the destruction to horses and camp equipage—I am also of opinion that it is a true maxim that business is better done when there are few to do it, than when divided among many, provided the amount to be done does not exceed the physical powers of the few—
I will however in all future contracts have regard to the Suggestion made by you. The individual instructions given to the Deputies now under contract, correspond with your views, as expressed in yours
<pb#376/>
of the 15" Ult” with regard to the Townshipping of West Florida, preparatory to laying down the private claims.
I have the honer to accompany herewith a Diagram ” of the Surveys executed under the last contracts with explanations—The Township lines, owing to high waters could not be extended to the Gulf generally—These deficiencies are now under orders for completion, and I anticipate my returns in the succeeding year will give you the out lines of Florida from West to East as far as the S" Johns River and to the Atlantic north of it—You will also receive herewith a map of the Chipola country from Ranges 9 to 14 inclusive which has been sectioned, commencing with Townships 3 respectively above the paralel, so as not to interfere with a large claim below —This Section of Country, I would respectfully recommend for the next Sale and the Country intervening between that and Tallahassee including the fractions on the Georgia line & Mickasuky lake to form the fall sale—I shall be prepared to forward you the returns of the Chipola sale in five days after I reach Tallahassee—
I shall inclose for your inspection & forwarding, an estimate * for Stationary on the House in Philadelphia by the Succeeding mail—

<docbody>SIR, Your letter of 15” ultimo,” accompanied by an extract of a communication from the Commissioner of the General Land Office to the Register at Jackson, Mississippi, was received by the last mail.
I do most sincerely regret, that any thing should have been omitted, which was required by law, in order to legalize the purchases which I
made of lands at private sale. It was my anxious wish to execute my duty with exactness and fidelity; and as it was new to me, I
1. No reply found.
<pb#380/>
acted more from the representations of others in the case before us, than from impressions derived from the examination of any law. I
was not aware, indeed, that such a provision as the one contained in the 10th Sect. of the Act of 10* May 1800 * existed. All that was necessary, as I understood the matter, was, that the Register was bound to present his application to the Surveyor General, and agree with him as to the price of the land, as others did with the Register, when the applications were made at his Office. This was complied with on my part, and the applications, signed by the Surveyor General, are now on file in the Register's office at Tallahassee. The money was paid to the Receiver, and duplicate receipts taken as in other cases, one of which I presume, has been already forwarded to your Department.—
I have enclosed the Surveyor General your communication, requesting him to forward such a report as the one required to legalize the sales. He has been urged to do so at as early a period as practicable. In conclusion, I have to repeat, that the omission is a source of great regret to me, and proceeded from an ignorance of the law.
As an evidence of my not being disposed to avail myself of any advantage which my station might be supposed to afford, I declined making an application for land until all those at the public sale had been supplied and departed from Tallahassee. If the Department consider the transaction, however, as involving the smallest impropriety, I
should greatly prefer a relinquishment of the land upon the mony's being refunded.”—
With sentiments of the highest respect & esteem, I remain Yr.

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose for your consideration an account of M. Crupper for his services in taking charge of Fort St.
Marks.” After the Post was evacuated & the property removed, pursuant to my instructions to have the Fort & buildings taken care of, it was my intention to have employed a man specially for that purpose. But Capt. Crupper being at the time about to fix himself in that part of the Country, I concluded to give it into his charge, with liberty to occupy a building as a Store & dwelling. No stipulation was made of any pay to him, though I stated to him that after the Fort had been finally disposed of, I would, if it should appear that the Fort & buildings were properly preserved, submit a reasonable account for his services to you for payment.—I could not at the time have got any other person to take charge of the Fort without a positive agreement for payment. Colonel Clinch has several times mentioned to me his opinion that some compensation ought to have been made, and I enclose with the account an extract from his Report on the subject of the Fort when turning it over to the Governor of the Territory. The account itself has been some months in my hands though I have hitherto omitted to forward it.—
The post was occupied by a Company of the 4* Reg" from the 10*
of July to 27* Novº during which time no allowance is made. If the account is admitted, the claimant does not wish the payment of the money here, but requests it may be passed to his credit at Mº

<docbody>To THE HON” JAMES BARBOUR, Secretary of War, SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith three letter's, two from the acting Governor of Florida;" and the other a copy of a letter addressed to him by M. Doyle, an agent sent by him to ascertain the true state and condition of the Florida Indians.
There is no difficulty in adjusting the limits so as to take in the Big Hammock. The line has already been directed to be so extended, as to embrace it. But from the dissatisfaction which these Indians have expressed from the commencement of their removal, and their horror of the Country allotted to them, and its acknowledged barreness and insalubrity, it is not reasonable to expect that there will be any change in their dispositions, and feelings, unless the Government undertake to feed them always.
ment relative to the use of the materials in the old buildings at St. Marks for the construction of a wharf at Pensacola, again stated that the survey had not been completed. See also act approved Mar. 2, 1833 (4 STAT. 664–665), to establish the town of St. Marks, Fla.
<pb#383/>
Under such circumstances the suggestion made by M. Doyle and Mr Walton, of offering them a Country West of the Mississippi, is respectfully recommended; and if approved, that the subject be presented to the Creek delegation now here, and if agreeable to them, that a provision be made in the contemplated Treaty for their union and removal with that Tribe, which if agreed to by the Florida Indians would settle and forever the existing difficulties.
It is possible however that the second extension of the Northern line, Westwardly, so as to embrace the Big Hammock, and which has been ordered, may satisfy them. If it is concluded best first to ascertain this, and it should not, they could be Treated with afterwards, leaving it with them to re-unite with the Creeks (as most of them once belonged to this Tribe, and make their stipulations with the Creeks for that object,) or settle upon lands, which themselves may select in some other quarter of the Territory West of the Mississippi. But their re-union with Creeks would be best.
All which is respectfully submitted.—

on the subject of the limits which are assigned for the emigrant Florida Indians; and the documents in relation to them. To remove all difficulty on this subject I have the honor to enclose a copy from the Map.” The first extension of the Northern line Northwardly, from the running by Col” Gadsden, limits I presume your views, and his, of the case; but you will see that this extension of the Northern line, North, has been subsequently ordered to be run in a Westerly direction to a point as indicated in the black lines, far enough West, as that when an angle is made for a line to run from thence, to the “flat lands filled with ponds,” it will embrace the Big Hammock. Will not this extension furnish lands fit to be inhabitted, and of sufficient productiveness and salubrity, to support the Indians? It was Governor Duval's opinion, that it would.

<place-time>WASHINGTON Nov. 28–1825.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I take the liberty to send for your perusal a memorial of the first Legislative council of Florida and would respectfully request your attention to the latter part in which the location of a Navy Yard and Depot, at Pensacola, is recommended;* although you will be more influenced in your selection of the place from the report of the respectable and intelligent Naval Officers whom you have despatched to the plaee spot for the purpose of making an examination, than from information acquired from any other and less official source, yet there are some considerations presented that may in some measure influence the future policy of the government in regard to its extent and the means necessary to its defence should it be located at that place. You will observe Sir, from an examination of the map, that by cutting a canal of about six miles in length the Bay of Mobile may be connected with that of Pensacola, which must be accomplished either by the government or the enterprize of individuals in a short time; a canal connecting these waters would open a direct communication from Pensacola several hundred miles into the state of Alabama by the large navigable streams which run into Mobile Bay—through which the goverment would find a safe and convenient transportation of troops, munition of war and large quantities of valuable ship timber, live Oak, red and white Cedar Cypress.
&C. East of Pensacola you are aware through St. Rosa sound and Chactawhachie river there is a safe channel for the same objects for
<pb#385/>
and the Fortifications of the harbour, by your opinion of the importance and extent of the contemplated establishment and as I shall at an early period of the session endeavour to get some measure adopted by which the explorerd points of our coast may befortified and particularly Pensacola, if it will not be too great an intrusion upon your valuable time, I should be much pleased to know whether an extensive Navy Yard is contemplated, which information will enable me to prepare measures accordingly. Give me leave to say Sir, that there is no point on the whole southern coast where an extensive Naval establishment could be made so advantagiously to the goverment as at Pensacola, and as all the commerce west of the Alligany mountains passes in that direction and when every point in the northern states is fortified and protected by the goverment in addition to the shield interposed by a dense population, that our southern commerce and coast, is greatly exposed and that we have powerful claims upon a munificent goverment disposed to protect with equal care every part of its empire.—I would also beg leave to call you attention to the importance of a survey of the coast of Florida from St Marks to Tampa Bay—I
am informed that no survey of this important part of our coast and that westward from St Marks. to St Andrews Bay has ever been made—Throughout this whole range there is no light-house or Beacon to guid the mariner.

<docbody>SIR On the 18* ins' I received intelligence from Captain Dan' E.
Burch Ass' q' master at Pensacola that the per diem allowance, paid to me, in June last for extra services as senior officer on the Augustine Road, had been excepted to, by the Secy of War *—this information
<pb#386/>
Sir, created in me no little concern, inasmuch as I had been repeatedly informed by Cap' B, that he had the assurances of the q' master General, that the compensation (1 $ per day) would be paid—In accordance with the dictates of my own proper interest and of Justice, I assume the liberty of relating to you, the facts and circumstances connected with the transaction and also my own sentiments on the subject—I should not have received the money at all, had it not of have been for the above mentioned assurances, & for the following reasons. The nature of the duties of the senior officer on the Road in question, were I conceived widely different from the ordinary duties of an Officer on a Mily Road.—Nine months were consumed in opening the Road, as far as the Tooloogie, a stream ten miles east of the Appalachicola, during the whole of which time, Capt* B. was present, but a very few days.-I was charged by him, both, with the general direction, and faithful execution of the Route, and can safely say, that there was much responsibility incident to the service—it was doubtless the intention of the Government, that as much satisfaction as possible, should be diffused, among the people of Florida, in the construction of this Road, and I flatter myself, that every effort was made on my part, to realize and confirm that view—I claim no merit in the premises, but am firmly of the belief, that when accountability of this kind is involved, a remuneration for services rendered, should follow as a matter of course—
With the force of these considerations I am peculiarly influenced;
and feel confident that the representation I have made, will meet your entire concurrence—with this conviction, Sir, I consider myself justifyed, in appealing to your sense of justice, aid and assistance, for a remission of the decree, which is the origin of this communication* &

<docbody>HON: HENRY CLAY Secretary of State, SIR, I deem it of importance to call your particular attention, to the Wreckers on the Florida Keys, and the evils that have, for a long time, and yet continue, to distress the Commerce of the United States on this coast.
The Legislative Council of Florida has endeavoured by law, which has been approved of by Congress to secure to the owners and underwriters the property that may be shipwrecked on this coast.” But
<pb#388/>
it is a subject on which I doubt the right of the Territory to Legislate;
and my opinion has been strengthened, by a decission of the Hon:
Judge Lee “ of Charlston; and also a decission of the Hon: Joseph L.
Smith of St: Augustine, declaring our Wrecking law Unconstitutional.” I have not had the decissions before me but I do not doubt they were rendered—You will at once admit that the interest of the United States is deeply involved when I assure you, that, from the best information, I feel convinced, that there is annually wrecked on the Florida Coast, property to the value of $500:000. The numerous Wreckers on this coast are unlicenced, and much of the property Wrecked is smuggled by them under the pretence of taking it for adjudication to different ports. There is also engaged in the fishing trade, from the Island of Cuba fifty or sixty vessels most of which belong to that Island. I believe many of them are little better than Pirates and Smugglers and are hew, under the pretence of fishing, engaged in smuggling and Wrecking to the great injury of our Country. I can think of no other remedy for these evils but to appoint a Judge to reside on some of the Keys, or at Tampa Bay, who should have jurisdiction of all such cases, and he should be required to remain at his post, as the business will occupy him daily. Some mode of granting licences should be provided by law and the power given to some Officer of Withdrawing the licence from any Wrecker who shall act fraudulently or contrary to law—
A port should be designated by law where all Wrecked property taken on the coast should be carried for adjudication: This would at once apprise the owners and underwriters at what place they could attend. At present they are wholly unadvised at which port wrecked property will be carried as that is left to the Salvors.
The Treasury Department, I know have hitherto appointed all Officers for our Revenue Cutters. These Officers should be specially selected for this coast: None but those best qualified and of known honesty ought to command; for the temptations are too numerous and strong in this quarter to be resisted by Ordinary Characters. The utmost attention and vigilence should be exercised over this coast, or much of the revenue of the United States will be lost. The contiguity of Cuba and other Islands to the Coast of Florida; and the numerous Keys and Inlets offer to the Smuggler the strongest tempta-

<docbody>GENERAL. Sometime this year, I was compelled to discharge my Indian Interpreter, in consequence of his dissipated habits, and have since, used the Interpreter, employed by the Sub Indian Agent near this post. The rations, issued to Indians, agreeably to the treaty, at St Augustine, having ceased, the Indian agency near this, has of course been broken up. I have therefore directed, the Interpreter to be employed, giving only $15 pr. month, being less, By $10, than he rec,d from the Governor of the Territory. From the number of Indians visiting, and near the post, it is absolutely necessary that we should have an Interpreter.
I have also employed a Spanish Interpreter, at $15 pr. month, which, I hope you will approve of. The coast south of this, is inhabited entirely by persons speaking the Spanish language only. Their detached situation, from the Havannah, and all places on the American coast, with the exception of this, induces them to look up to us for protection. They are frequently robb,d by pirates calling themselves, Columbian vessells of War, and even, if Columbians, they have no right, to land on our coast, and commit depredations, although admitting it might be against their enemies. These Spaniards have been settled, on the Coast for more than thirty years, were at their present places of habitation, at the exchange of flags, and have remained there since. They have applied to me, to become American Citizens, but having no authority to receive their oaths of Allegiance I have applied to Governor Duval, for such power which I have no doubt, will be given.
With the boats, belonging to the post, I shall make frequent excursions, along the coast, visiting all the Harbors, and inlets, and should I find any Columbian vessell of War, or pirate or smuggler, they will
“As the headnote indicates, this request seems to have been disregarded.
<pb#390/>
be taken, and reported to the Government. There has been one instance of a brig, having come into the lower part of this Bay, with a cargo of 150 Africans, & no doubt with the intention of smuggling them ashore, either to persons in this Territory, or the lower parts of the State of Georgia. This information, I rec,d from the Indians, about two months after the brig left the bay, but I could never ascertain correctly, whether any of the negroes were landed. The interpreter is an excellent pilot, and would, in that capacity render important services. I have applied to Genl Scott for permission to make these excursions, and also informed him, that the Indians, I believe are in the habit of receiving spirits, and other articles, from the Havannah which should be stopp, d.
There are some few articles of public property in my possession, which I have not been able to make a report of, agreeably to the regulations, as the vouchers, rec,d from Capt Burch were lost. I shall write to him for copies of them, and will forward a return, as soon, as rec,d.
I have given to Capt Clarke, more than one half of my command for the road, and, it all times affords me great pleasure to render all the aid and assistance in my power, to forward these internal improvements, as I firmly believe it, is, the great link, which will bind the American Confederacy, and prevent its separation. The road is progressing rapidly, and will be the best in the southern Country.”

SIR, I have read with attention and profit, your letter of the 28th ult.* and the memorial referred to in it, and will not fail to give due weight to the considerations they present, in any official act which I
may have to perform, connected with a naval Establishment on the Coast of Florida.
It is not yet in my power to state the character and extent of the establishment which ought to be formed there, because depending on facts not yet thoroughly ascertained.
The surveys, which you mention, are needed; but this Department has no means under its control to make them.

A more frequent intercourse being desireable between Tallahassee
& the Hartford & Montgomery line, it is now determined to authorize another mail on y' route, so as to raise it to a weekly transportation.
If therefore you will make a bid for that add" service on reasonable terms it will be accepted. It may be proper to observe to you that the pay on mail routes is not usually encreased at the same rate that the number of trips are encreased, or that it would be wrong to infer that by doubling y' trips you would exactly double y' Compensation*

<docbody>TO GEORGE GRAHAM Esq’ Commissioner of General Land Office—
SIR I have considered the proposition you did me the honor to suggest, yesterday, in regard to the next Sale of the U. S. lands in
<pb#395/>
Florida, and beg leave to submit for the consideration of the President, some objections to the sale of Chipola lands in March.”
I cannot see any reasons deemed forcible or convincing, why the sales shall not progress in the usual way, of those lands contiguous to the District which has been sold by the U. S.–There is a district of Country, as you will observe, from the Georgia line to “Forbes Purchase” between the Oclockney an Apalachicola, on which there are a number of Settlers equally able to purchase, and more so, than the Chipola settlers; they have been induced to beleive that the Sales would progress in that direction, and have made preparations accordingly; the lands are not generally so good as those of Chipola, the Country much more spotted, and out of the 12 or 14 Townships with the fractions, and that which was unsold of the Twenty Townships, which will probably be considered sufficient, a Sale might be ordered.
The U. S. will have as good an opportunity for making a Sale at this time of those lands, as at any other; much of the land in that Country, and particularly in the vicinity of Quincy (the County seat of Gadsden) is of the first quality, as you will perceive by reference to the return of Surveys.-
The Planters on Chipola encountered many difficulties in forming their settlements in that quarter, and have exhausted their means of purchasing, in the improvement of their farms, but have a fair prospect of being remunerated by the next fall, for the money expended in the opening and improvement of the Country, from their crops by which it is hoped they will be enabled to purchase their lands; and it is certainly the interest as well as the duty of Govern", in a frontier and exposed Country, to sell out their lands to small settlers where they can get a fair price, rather than to large Planters who would quarter the borders of the Union with overseers and negroes. If the sale of these lands were directed in March, the numerous and respectable families who are now there, would be driven from their homes and if there is a good deal of “money ready” for the Chipola lands, it is not in the hands of the Settlers, but an equal sum may be realized by them, if the sale is postponed until Fall.—
I think from this and many other considerations, it would be adviseable to let the Sales progress regularly, that the population may be increased and strengthened in the centere, about the Seat of Govern", where those desirous of settling have examined the lands, where there are no cogent reasons for a departure from established usage *—

HON. Jo" L. WHITE Wash City.
In consequence of the Suggestions rec" from you in the conversation alluded to in yº letter of to day,” a proposition for an add' mail from Tallahassee to the Hartford & Montgomery line, has been despatched to M' M*Comb, the Contº, which it is presumed will speedily accomplish y' object in that respect. Upon comparing the comp" now allowed for the weekly mail between Tallahassee & Pensacola, with that given for the fortnight mail been the former place & Sº Augustine it is found that the Service on the Pensacola route considering the superior distance is performed on much lower terms than that on Sº Augustine route, & it is inferred that an augmentation of the accommodation on the S" Augustine route, to the extent you propose, would require a greater expense than can with prudence be appropriated to that object. It is hoped that the add' accomd" proposed to be given on the route to G", will satisfy the present demand of the Citizens you represent, & that until the population & intercourse on the line from Tallahassee to St Augustine shall reach a State requiring
& justifying greater expense for its mail accomd", the existing arrangem" will be considered as Sufficient. The Dep" feels every disposition to extend its advantages to this interesting Territory to the utmost extent of the wishes of its inhabitants, but there are restraints imposed by justice & economy, which I am Sure you are sensible of, that a public Servant can never lose Sight of.”

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose herewith monthly Summary Statements; Reports of Persons & Articles hired; and Reports of Stores received for transportation & distribution; for the Months of October & November 1825. No Summary Statements for the Military Road opening from Pensacola to St: Augustine are made for
<pb#400/>
these months as there were no disbursements; nor is there any statement for October on account of the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay for the same reason.—
I also enclose Estimates for funds required in the three first months of the next year for disbursements on account of the Q Master's department.—
I am going into Alabama on the 10* Inst. to settle with the persons who were employed with Teams marching with the Troops & transporting provisions to Fort Mitchell during the last Summer.—
The funds which I now have on hand on account of the two Roads, (being informed of a remittance of ten thousand dollars by the last mail,) added to the Balance on hand on account of the Q Master's department will I trust, with what credit I can command myself, pay off all the claims on that account.—The money taken from the Road funds will not be required so immediately but that I can use it in this way. I expect however some time in January to inspect the Road opening by Mº Bellame, as well as that to be completed by M*
Bailey, when if they are in a state to be received I shall have them to pay;”—but I hope that by that time I shall have received sufficient funds on account of the Quarter Master's department to replace the Sums used on that account.—
I have made as accurate a calculation & statement of the debts now due as I possibly can without having all the claims before me;
and it will require $.17,500.-as the least Sum, in addition to the balance of $.13,000.-shewn on hand in the last month's statement, to pay up all the debts due on account of the Q Master's department
& payable at this Post, to the close of the present year.-I request therefore that the General will be pleased to remit me that amount.”—

GENTLEMEN. The letter from M* Ward relative to the Sale of the Chipola lands in the month of March next,” together with a communication from M* White * the Delegate from Florida was submitted to the President who has directed that the Chipola lands shall not be proclaimed for sale until the 1* Monday in Decem' next.”
No sale will therefore take place in March. It is possible that a sale of the Lands in the neighborhood of Quincy together with those that were heretofore proclaimed but not offered at public sale may be sold on the 1st Monday of June next, provided such information may be received previous to the middle of February, as may in the opinion of the President make it expedient to have such sale. Mr White seems at present to be doubtful of the expediencey of such sale, but as there will be time to proclaim a Sale to take place in June, at any time previous to the middle of February, the decision of the question is suspended for the present, and I will be much obliged to you for your views in relation to the Sale of these Lands in June, or whether it would be better to wait until December when a Sale of twenty or more townships could be had, consisting of the townships adjacent to Quincy, and those embracing the principal Settlements on the Chipola.”

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</dochead>
<source>[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:C)</source>
<place-time>- [December 10, 1825)</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled.—
The Memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida Respectfully represents—That actuated by a thorough conviction of the importance of certain measures to her interests as a Territory and to her progress in attaining the name and dignified Character of one of the United States of which measures Congress have the sole Legis-
<pb#403/>
lative cognizance and at the same time under a firm belief that your honorable bodies while they carefully advance and anxiously regard the general and common weal will not hesitate to adopt measures so pregnant in their results with the interests of the General Government nor fail to cherish with the same solicitude because of her peculiarly infantile and dependant situation interests thus resulting to the Territory itself we deem no other reasons needful to encourage us to lay before your Honorable bodies our views in relation to these objects.
Your Memorialists on recurring to the several subjects which have presented themselves for remedy and which have hitherto operated as evils would beg leave to suggest as the first and probably as paramount in importance the subject of the establishment of a Court having maritime jurisdiction upon the peninsula of Florida for the more convenient immediate and just adjudication of cases resulting from the multitude of Wrecks which from the Character of our Coasts must annually take place. The exteme danger of the navigation from the mouth of the Mississippi River to S' Augustine and particularly that portion of it from Key West to the latter place is as a fact so proverbial that it need not be suggested except as in connection with other facts it declares the necessity of Governmental interference to encourage individual enterprise by offering a protection to the property both of the planters and the merchants as well as to improve the commercial condition of the Nation by obviating the difficulties which nature seems to have raised as impediments to its progress. For when it is recollected that the whole of the produce of that extensive and agricultural portion of the Union the Western and South Western States together with a great part of the Commerce between the United States and the West Indies must necessarily on its passage to market encounter the dangers of a Coast composed of Shoals and reefs and for the distance of four hundred miles uninhabitable the result becomes alike obvious and necessary that individual distress is constantly accumulating and individual interests both as it regards life and property daily sacrificed the planter is deprived in an hour of the product of his twelve months labour the capitolists of the Country become bankrupt and the energies and enterprise of the Citizen are enervated and destroyed. Thus is suggested the importance to which subject your honorable bodies will doubtless give due consideration of encouraging the formation of wrecking Companies and of holding out inducements to the masters of wrecking Wessels to become active in the preservation of the lives and property of the unfortunate which your memorialists conceive can only be effected by the establishment of a proper tribunal upon the peninsula immediately in the neighborhood of the reef where the Wreckers may immediately have his salvage adjudged to him as his
<pb#404/>
recompense.—With these objects in view and presuming upon the confirmation of Congress to give it validity the Legislative Council of the Territory during their Session of the last year established by law a territorial Court at Key West invested with power to hear and determine all causes arising upon Wrecks to adjudge his salvage to the Wrecker &" which your memorialists confidently believe has not only served the purposes of humanity but has also been extensively advantageous to the commerce of the Union and of other Nations.
But we regret to say that the United States Courts both of this Territory and of the neighboring states have declared the law of the Council creating such Court invalid as contradictory to the laws of the United States * and your memorialists thus driven to the necessity of applying to the General Government for relief would hope to be indulged in the suggestion that if in its Wisdom Congress should deem it consistent and expedient to delegate to the Legislative Council of this Territory the power of creating and establishing a Court on the peninsula with the powers and for the purposes before alluded to as well as of laying such duties upon sales at auction of such property as may be adjudicated upon and exposed to sale by the order of such Court it would redound at once to the interests of General Government and of the Territory by securing to the Treasury of the latter a sufficient fund to defray a large proportion of the expence incident to her Government and from the vicinity of said Court to the seat of Government of this Territory the Legislative authority could we believe so controll and direct its powers that extensive benefit would be the result of its operations.
As next in connection with this subject your memorialists would remark that the establishment of a port of entry at S*Andrews Bay they think deserves the consideration of the General Government”
The Country is fertile and tolerably well settled there are three branches of said Bay stretching out for many miles and indeed through the whole extent of the settlements yet for the want of a port legally established altho' the lands are productive and the waters always navigable and altho' the inhabitants have no other out-let for their produce nor other inlet for the supplies which they may need from abroad they are not able to dispose of the one or obtain the other and
<pb#405/>
your memorialists believe that if such port were established it would be a convenience to the people and a source of revenue to the Government.
Your Memorialists recollecting the magnificent policy which the United States have adopted upon internal improvements beg to remind Congress of so much of the memorial” of this body at its last session as relates to the subject of a Canal through the peninsula to connect the navigable waters of the S" John's River with those of the Suwanee and to add thereto the idea of a Western continuation of the same to the Bay of Mobile by removing the obstructions which at present accidentally occur in the Bayou Manchac a navigable water connecting the Mississippi River and Lake Ponchartrain Such a canal complete and of sufficient width and depth would enable Steam Boats on the Mississippi River of ordinary tonnage with ease and safety to visit the Atlantic Sea-board at S* Marys Darien and Savannah in Georgia and in the City of Charleston*—Your Memorialists cannot omit to remark on this subject that from the best information which is within their power all the canalling necessary to connect the various navigable waters from the Sº Marks river at Fort S*Marks to Mobile Bay would little if any exceed twelve miles where the cutting would not require more than to be a ditch of sufficient dimension to contain the column of water required—The distance from S' Marks to the Suwannee River entirely through a low flat sandy Country exclusive of any natural assistance which may be afforded by streams in that
<pb#406/>
direction does not exceed sixty miles and the difficulty of cutting would not be greater than that already described. From the navigable waters of the S*Affee” a branch of the Suwannee to the navigable waters of Black Creek a branch of the Sº Johns and at points where those streams will always furnish fifteen or twenty feet depth of water does not exceed the distance of forty miles in which rout there are several lakes which would shorten the distance to be excavated eight or ten miles and perhaps more this rout lies over a country slightly undulating.—A Canal one hundred feet wide and containing water ten feet in depth would afford all the facilities which can be desired. It is believed that the whole expense would little if at all exceed two millions of dollars for its complete construction.—Your memorialists believe that the manifest advantage in the rise of public Lands in this Territory and the extensive and prompt facilities in the transportation of war munitions or soldiers which it would furnish for the protection of the Atlantic Sea-board in time of war not to advert to the incalculable commercial advantages which would result to all those States whose waters are tributary to the Mississippi River or to the commerce of the world around the Cape of Florida, now and ever precarious would be and are considerations of sufficient magnitude to induce Congress to adopt measures for the completion of this project.—Although Your Memorialists do not abandon the ground they have already assumed on this subject and although they are confidently of opinion that by opening the proposed Canal as a high road for the commerce of all parts of the North American Republic and of the world upon the principles already recognized and acted upon by Congress in relation to Internal Improvements and thereby to demonstrate the wisdom of the policy established, yet should Congress feel disinclined to act upon this subject, your Memorialists would respectfully suggest the propriety of granting to this Government the Land wherever it is public for half a mile in width on each side of said Canal rout where it may be laid down with powers to borrow money incorporate companies and to do all and other acts and things necessary for its erection as to the Government may seem fit.87–
<pb#407/>
Your Memorialists convinced that it is the policy of the General Government as soon as practicable to remove and concentrate West of the Mississippi River and beyond the verge of the white settlements the different tribes of Indians and likewise convinced that their entire removal from Florida would redound not only to the interests of the Territory but also to those of the General Government by the consequent enhancement of the value of the Public Lands that will be eventually offerred and exposed to sale and judging from the peculiar Character of these people that they are and always will be dissatisfied within any prescribed limits of this Territory and consequently more so when agreably to the arrangement of the General Government they are left solely to agricultural pursuits for their future subsistence and inasmuch as the Creek Indians within the chartered limits of the State of Georgia from whom the Seminoles of Florida are originally descended and between whom there exist as consanguinity as well as comity of interests are about to be removed beyond the Mississippi...—Your Memorialists believe that on this occasion they would be more likely to acceed to a proposition for a removal than under any other circumstances—Your Memorialists would therefore venture to recommend that a Treaty be held with them for the purpose of effecting so desirable an object. And in connection with this subject your Memorialists would beg leave to represent the defenceless condition of this section of the Territory as well as the uncertainty of the duration of any amicable arrangement that may have been or shall be made with these savage neighbors and as a consequent to request from the General Government one thousand stand of arms to be deposited in the City of Tallahassee for the use and defence of the Territory of Florida.
Your Memorialists in compliance with the expression of the public wish of a part of this Territory solicit if it should comport with the views of the General Government the delegation to the Legislative Council of a discretionary power to enable the people of this Territory by law to elect their County officers.”—Your Memorialists would farther suggest that for the purpose of encouraging settlements in this Territory as well as in justice to those individuals who have already settled upon and improved public Lands a law establishing and regulating pre-emption rights would operate to the advantage of the people without injustice or injury to the Government.
<pb#408/>
Your Memorialists beg leave to represent that a sale of the reserved quarter Section of Land adjoining the City of Tallahassee being the North West Quarter of Section Number Six Township Number one and Range Number One South of the baſs]is paralel line and East of the Meredian would operate very much to the improvement of the City of Tallahassee and the benefit of the Territory in providing funds for the erection of public buildings in said City and they therefore pray that Congress will authorise the Legislative Council to divide the said quarter Section into Lots and sell the same applying the funds accruing solely for the erection of such public buildings The guardianship of the rights and interests of the community by the enactment of salutary Laws your Memorialists deem a matter of the most vital importance to the happiness and prosperity of the people of this Territory. But limited as they are in their sessions and varied and multitudinous as are the objects that are presented for Legislative interference they regret to say that with all the diligence they have been able to use it has not been in their power to mature and complete a great proportion of the business which they believe was important and which they hoped to have had time to act upon but which for another year at least must remain unprovided for.
Your Memorialists therefore most earnestly request that to enable them to act with more deliberation and] the better to systematize the Laws of the Territory as well as to give them a more equal operation the term of their session may be lengthened from one to two months., For the accomplishment of these and all other objects of public utility your Memorialists unite with their Fellow citizens in a reliance on the Wisdom of Congress for such] assistance and co-operation as may comport with the station which this Infant [Territory holds in the Union.

<docbody>HON: JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War To Co' M*Kenney who is charged, with the Indian Affairs in your department I have written a particular account of the State of the Indian Affairs in this Territory.” The responsibility which the Agent Co" Humphreys has thrown upon me by not conforming to my instructions, Copies of which have been transmitted to Co" M*Kenney has not only Surprised but has Seriously deranged my whole plan for the Government of the Indians in this quarter. I am not informed by the Agent why my instructions were not pursued, or why the Indians were not brought within their limits, altho they went to the borders. I am convinced a military force is necessary to bring these people to order and obedience, and I have recommended the establishment of a post on the South frontier of Allachua.” My personal influence will very much contribute to effect any order which your Department may require to be executed.
Permit me to Suggest that if Congress Should mak any arrangement with the Creek Nation So as to remove them entirely, The Siminole Indians would be willing to go with them, and that a Treaty might be made with the Florida Indians highly advantageous to the United States. Should Such a measure be authorised by the Government, I cannot too Strongly urge the appointment of Co' James Gadsden as one of the Commissioners, he is not only personally acquainted with all the Chiefs but understands the Indian Character perfectly. The Indians on the Appalachicola whose lands were reserved to them by the late Treaty would no doubt be willing also to emigrate *

My presence is necessary sometimes to prevent mischief, or broils between our citizens & the Indians—is this considered as part of my duty and if so—must I serve my country without any allowance—Will I be permitted to charge by the day for my services and expences when actually engaged in the discharge of duties, belonging to the Indian department, These questions are put to you expressly with a view of understanding what is the rule in your department, so that I may, know, what to expect and how to conform The fact is that for near 3 years I did discharge the whole duties of Supt."
Agent & subagent, and my compensation as allowed did not actually cover the expence of my office, I confess that I feel myself not fairly treated in this matter, altho I have no doubt, Mr. Calhoun at the time fully believed justice had been rendered to me—I do not believe it can ever be the interest of our Government, to avoid paying a man well, who faithfully discharges his duty, when this is left to the discression of any Department,”

<docbody>HoNLE SAMUEL L SOUTHWARD Secretary of the Navy I had the honor last winter while at Washington to address you on the subject of the depredations made in Florida on the ship Timber near the Gulf stream and the rivers running into it, The country from the mouth of the Occilla river has been surveyed as far on towards Pensacola as the Choctahatchee river—The Bays of St. Andrews, St. Joseph and Appalachicola, presents altogether the best timber for ship building in the United States—but the Government may be assured that to preserve it. a special agent should be immediately appointed with power to examine and select such sections and fractions as in his judgement should be reserved for use of the Navy—and report the same to the Government. The agent. should be orderd to superintend and preserve, unmolested the lands so reserved from intruders of evey discription—I hazzard nothing in saying that the imployment of an agent for this object, would be great economy and would save even at this time thousands of dollars worth of the most valuable ship timber annually to the United States, I would earnestly recommend as the agent to be appointed Mº Charles Haire a resident of Tallahassee a man of information good judgement strict honor, and persevering activity I believe this gentleman is personally know to you, and if he is he will not need any recommendation—
The country on the St. Josephs and St Andrews Bay is settling fast.
none of the lands in that quarter have yet been sold but it is expected the sale will be ordered next spring, It should be posponed in my opinion untill the reservations are made for the Government.

John Q. ADAMS President of the United States SIR, The duties of the Executive Office have become so oppressive that I find myself unable to perform all the writing necessary—There is no other Territory from which so many communications are required—
The peculiar Situation of Florida with twelve hundred Miles of Sea Coast demands of the Executive, constant attention, to the various subjects, directly under the controle of the several departments of the General Government, and these require frequently my attention. I
do not know, whither the Governors of other Territorys keep a record of their proceedings, and of their correspondence with the Several Departments of the General Government, as well as a Seperate record of local business transacted in the Executive Office; Such however has ever been my practice, and its value and importance will (without detail on my part) be obvious to a Statesman—From the accumulation of business, I cannot continue the course hitherto pursued, unless some provision is made for a Clerk.-
I have seriously impaired my vision by constant writing of Nights, which I have been in the habit of doing even in Summer frequently until midnight. Since my return to Florida I can say truly that my business has become so pressing that for four weeks past, I have been confined to my Office till twelve at Night and frequently until two in the morning. It is impossible to stand this long, and I assure you Sir, the business of the Office must be neglected unless I am permitted to employ a Clerk. One could be had by the year for $600
or 700 Dollars,”—

<docbody>THE HON. H. CLAY Secretary of State SIR, Private communications received from St Augustine since my arrival here, informed me that Judge Smith of the Superiour Court of East Florida, by a sentence of his court pronounced during my absence, had dismissed me from the bar thereof and appointed a district attorney in my stead. Holding a commission from the United States,” constituting and appointing me a Judicial officer of that district, similar in its nature and tenure to that held by Judge Smith, I deny his right or power to pass such a sentence or even to suspend me from the discharge of my official functions, but as he has taken on himself the responsibility of exercising such power, I am constrained to apply to your department, and ascertain whether I am still regarded there as the United States Attorney for East Florida, or if it should be deemed proper that I should be suspended from my office till an investigation of my conduct be had under your order, that I may be immediately and officially advised thereof, in order to be released from the responsibility attached to my office—Whatever views may be entertained by you on this subject, I feel myself entitled and request of the department over which you preside, that a further investigation of my official conduct be afforded me, an enquiry of this character, I have ever been willing to submit to, and in one instance requested it.
The object of my present visit to Washington is to prefer charges against Judge Smith, (and of which he was acquainted previous to my having left St Augustine, and the delivery of the sentence by which I
am so much affected) My intention to do this I would have apprized you of, early after my arrival, but ignorant of the course and practice
<pb#417/>
proper to be observed in such matters & from motives of respect I
addressed my communication to Col White the delegate from Florida, making known to him the object of my visit and the character of my charges *—
Since I have had the honour of being an officer of the government it has been my wish to claim no distinction or preference other than that I could claim as a citizen but now I am compelled to appeal to you for that which as a citizen I would not ask, viz that you will direct an enquiry by persons selected by you into my official conduct, which deeply and necessarily involves my private reputation and honour—Judge Smiths personal feelings towards me, preclude me from anything like a fair and impartial hearing before him, in this assertion I am warranted by his long and repeated and aggrevated conduct towards me both as an officer of his court and as an individual, and my defence when fairly made will go so far much to implicate him with having used undue and improper means to inculpate me that it could not be urged on a court where he presided, without subjecting me to the indignation and anger of the court, which he would constitute "—

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Ind: Affairs, 26* December 1825.</place-time>
<docbody>To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Governor of Florida.
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your several communications of the 2,” and 12* Instant,” accompanied by an explanatory Map of the Country ceded to the Florida Indians,” and
<pb#418/>
a letter to you from J. Belloure,” complaining of depredations upon his property by a party of the emigrant Indians; also, certain copies of letters and instructions to the agent Colonel Humphreys,” all which have been submitted to the Secretary of War.
I am directed by the Secretary in reply, to state, that he had received from the late Acting Governor Walton, certain communications relating to the issuing of rations &c, * and a copy of one from Charles Pindar to Col", Walton,” the complexion of which, taken altogether, was not satisfactory. No reply has been made to Colº
Walton. It was delayed in the expectation that something further might happen in regard to these communications, or at least that the aid extended to the Indians on the representations which had been made of their starving condition, might produce quiet, and a state of permanent harmony—when the intimations conveyed in that correspondence implicating some of the parties, would have formed the subject of a Special enquiry.
The points of difficulty appear to be two: First—The location of the Indians by the Agent, upon lands (called the Big Swamp) not included in the extension of the Northern boundary. Second—The over issue of Rations, by the agent, in violation of positive instructions.”—In regard to the first, the Secretary of War directs however exceptionable he esteems the location, under all the circumstances of the case to be, that the Indians be permitted to occupy both the Big Swamp and the Big Hammock—The Big Hammock of right, and by virtue of a formal and legal extension of the Northern and Western line; the other by Courtesy—and for the time being, subject to the future directions of the President. You will explain this to them fully; and give them the option to accept of this right of temporary
<pb#419/>
occupancy or go at once, and locate permanently within the limits assigned to them; or, if they would prefer it, to lands which the Government is willing to assign them West of the Mississippi.
The subject of your recommendation for the establishment of a Military post on the South Frontier, of Allachua will be considered, by the Secretary.
The Secretary directs, that, you proceed with the examination of the complaints in regard to the rations. This subject having been entrusted to you under instructions, from the Department, no one it is presumed can so well determine upon the abuse, which is implied in the several communications before me, or a violation of your instructions by the Agent.
The Secretary of War directs that you make a thorough examination into every branch of the subject connected with the procuring and issuing of the rations, and especially into that referr'd to, by Colº Walton, on Mº Pindar's letter to him, and report the same with your own opinions, to the Department.
You will order the Sub-agent to such point on the Appalachicola, as you may esteem to be best.
The answers to your queries are these—first—If, in the examination, now ordered, you shall find the delivery of rations by Mº Chaires was indispensable; to the Indians; and that they could not have been sustained without them; you will pay for them. Second—The excess is to be allow'd on the same principle. Third—All the accounts of the Agent are to be submitted to your examination, on which you will make such decisions as well in regard to the vouchers, as to other things, as you may esteem it proper to make, to be submitted to the Department for its final determination.
It will be proper to ascertain the loss complained of by Mº Belloure and report it to the Department with your own opinion of its fairness.
The Indians under the act of 1802,” will be held responsible for such acts, and so you will inform them.
Your views in regard to the mode of paying the Indians their annuities are in strict accordance with my own.” There can be no doubt of the evils which result to these unfortunate people, from the application, by themselves, of their annuities; nor that the amount goes directly to the venders of Spirituous liquors who beset the annuity grounds.-Annuities are a curse to the Indians, rather than a blessing, unless their application be made for them. Humanity requires that you take measures to obtain their consent to allow the
<pb#420/>
annuity to be paid to them in goods suited to their wants: But if they insist on having the money, we have no right to refuse it.”—
I have the honor, to be, &c &.

<place-time>[Referred December 27, 1825)</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.
The memorial of the undersigned Citizens of the Counties of Jackson and Walton in the Territory of Florida respectfully represents, That your memorialists attached to this country by the fertile character of its Soil and the Commercial advantages which it seemed to promise from its proximity to the Bay and harbour of Saint Andrews, have withdrawn from the States in which they formerly resided all their property with the view and intention of making a permanent settlement here—some of your memorialists have resided here several Years and all of them have lived in the Country a sufficient length of time to grow something for market, and if the prospects which its natural advantages afford should be realized they will never regret their removal hither; although, in doing so, they have had to exchange the comforts and pleasures of society and comparative ease, for the labour and privat (MS. torn] necessarily incident to a new settlement, entirely remote from population and civilized Life.—In regard to the first inducement, your memorialists are happy to state that they have not been deceived, there is no Country perhaps of simmilar extent in which the principle articles of export from the southern States can be raised with more facility and in greater abundance, but your memorialists have not as yet, been so fortunate in their expectations of commercial advantages—it is true they had anticipated inconveniences of this sort in their early settlements, but they had indulged the belief that as soon as they had prepared for Market produce to a sufficient extent to make it an object for commercial enterprize, those difficulties would subside; having almost at their doors one of the finest Harbours in the southern Country they believed that no obstacle would be presented to an easy transportation of every surplus article which their industry and economy would produce, and that in return for such products they would receive through the same easy Channel the Comforts and neessaries of Life—
In this however, they have in some degree been disappointed. and this disappointment has resulted entirely from want of a Port of Entry at Saint Andrews.--So long as your memorialists are compelled to trade in little coasting vessels to the small Villages on the Sea-board, in which Ports of Entry have been established, so long will the profits of their labour be reduced, and so long will the prices of the articles which their comfortncessarily compells them to import be advanced—
<pb#422/>
When your memorialists take into view the beautiful and healthy situation of the Bay of Saint Andrews and the almost entire absence of everything like obstruction to its easy entrance, (there being a wide channel of 18 feet water over its bar)—when they regard the perfect security which its Harbour affords to vessels of every description and when they cast an Eye over the numerous bodies of fertile Lands so situated as to point to it as the natural Outlet for all their products, they can but think that it is destined at some not very remote period to be a place of much commercial importance and enterprize, and your memorialists confidently believe that the moment foreign and other Wessels are permited to enter directly into the Bay without the necessity of going one or two hundred miles beyond their destination, for the purpose of entering at some Custom-house, will be the dawn of that importance.—
Your memorialists therefore humbly pray that your honorable Body would take this matter into early consideration, and if it should not be considered inconsistent with the interest of the Government, that a Port of Entry may be established at the Bay of Saint Andrews as soon as it may be deemed practicable—and your memorialists will ever pray &c.—

<docbody>To The Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the U.
States in Congress assembled—
The Undersigned in virtue of a resolution of the Legislative Council of Florida,” a copy of which is herewith enclosed, Do most respectfully invite the attention of the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the U States in Congress assembled to the important object of uniting by a canal, through the promontory of Florida, the waters of the Gulf of Mexico with those of the Atlantic *—.To the discerning minds of Representatives coming from various parts
<pb#426/>
of the U States, and deeply impressed with the importance of opening new channels of intercourse between the extremities and sections as the surest means of developing the resources and strengthening the bonds of the union, it would be unnecessary to enumerate in detail all the benefits to be expected from the accomplishment of a work partaking in its character more of national than local interest.
While the American commerce, but particularly the coasting trade between the East and the West, will be relieved from a heavy tribute annually exacted in the form of shipwrecks and insurance; while the dangerous shoals of the Florida Keys will be avoided, and the distance from the Atlantic ports to the mouths of the Missippi greatly reduced, the increased facilities to certain and rapid communications along an exposed frontier adding to the national security by augmenting the means of national defence will be a result the no less imposing—The Undersigned therefore in forwarding the views of the Legislative Council of Florida on a subject of such general interest, do most respectfully solicit of Your honorable body the necessary orders and appropriations for an immediate exploration of the country under the direction of skilful Engineers with a view of ascertaining the most direct practicable route for the canal contemplated, as well as the probably cost of its construction—Its practicability being established the expense of its execution, it is believed, will be found to bear no proportion to the benefits of which the whole Union may partake, and these considerations in favor of a great National canal, embarrassed in its execution by no constitutional impediments, encourage the hope that the General Government will undertake the operation as a work appropriately its own—If however different views of this subject should control a decision of your honorable body adverse to this desirable result; the preliminary facts of practicability and cost being ascertained by a corps of Scientific Engineers deservedly enjoying the confidence of the whole community, supported by the further countenance of the General Government in the form of a proportional pecuniary contribution to a joint stock company, it is believed by your Memorialist would operate as powerful inducements to private Individuals to embark their capitals in the accomplishment of the undertaking—It is therefore most earnestly solicited of your honorable body; that whether as a national work to be constructed exclusively with the public funds for general benefit, or as a work to be undertaken by private enterprise under a charter of incorporation with full powers for saidpurpose; you will early adopt such preliminary measures and extend such assistance as in your wisdom may be deemed neces-

receipted to Capt Burch for them, at once, and although in use at the post, have remained, in my charge, as I knew, they would be well taken care of, being in some measure delicate articles, and not to be trusted to the carpenters, generally.

404 7' E. R. R. I TOR I. A. L. PA P E R S The new boat, furnished me by Capt Burch, cost a great deal more, than I had any idea of, and in fact, is overcharged by at least $500.
She is a plain built boat, no Kind of extra, or fine work about her.
The sails, are indifferent, and in which we have been cheated. This boat, is only five feet more in the Keel, than the boat lost during my absence at Pensacola, and which, this was intended to supply the place of. It is true she is coppered, but only to light water mark, and copper fastened, This is absolutely necessary, as, in this climate, the worms, are so destructive, as to, destroy a boat in a few months without this protection. The boat will last, probably twenty years, with good care, with the additional expence of some suits of sails.
A boat of this size is required, in consequence of our exposed marine location, and the great distance we are placed from all intercourse with the white settlements, should we require assistance. I could send her, with safety to Pensacola or St Marks. Besides, there have been pirates even, in this bay, since our residence. A brig with a large earge number of Africans, remained sometime, in Tampa Bay, (intended to be smuggled into this Territory and the lower parts of the State of Georgia) which had we known of, we could not have captured, without such a boat. (About a week after the brig left Tampa, we were informed by the Indians, who had been bribed to secrecy)
This coast, is seldom visited by vessells of War, and we have been obliged, to keep an eye to the coast, as well as the interior. Wessells are frequently wrecked on the eeast Keys near us, and in one instance it appears the crew, landed on an island, where they perished for want of water, or food, as the skeletons of several were found, around, what appeared to have been a fire, and a trunk with some cloathes, marked J. Read. A vessell since we have been here, was stranded at the same place, and had it not been for us, all the goods would have been lost, and probably, the passengers and crew, would have starved perished. Amongst the passengers, was a lady.

In addition to these obstacles to a compliance with your request, it would seem from the terms of the
“Act for the establishment of a Territorial Government in Florida”, that it is the duty of the Secretary, under the direction of the Governor, to record and preserve the papers and proceedings of the Executive, the principal duties for which you require this assistance, and that, consequently, The President of the United States is precluded, by the very terms of the Act, from authorising the employment of a clerk for that purpose, especially as the appropriation for defraying the contingent expenses of the Territory is limited to so small a sum.

<place-time>SAINT AUGUSTINE 10th January 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR Sir, Having observed that you are a member of the Judiciary Committee, I take the liberty of submitting to you a few facts relating to the case of Judge Smith of this Territory, who has been arraigned before Congress upon certain charges which will probably be examined into in the course of the present session. The local Legislature here, has from time to time, by its enactments, imposed multiplied and troublesome duties upon the Judges of the Superior Courts, for which extra labour however, some compensation appears to have been provided in the Act relating to the salaries and fees of the different public officers of the Territory. The most eminent Lawyers here, have concurred in so construing the Act in question; and the Judge was first solicited by them to receive fees for the various services, which under the Territorial Laws, he was frequently called upon to perform; so that if he has committed an error in doing this, he has in fact been led into it by the advice and opinion of the leading members of his own Court.
There was none better qualified either by abilities or learning, rightly to interpret the Law referred to than the Judge himself, and he did not proceed to collect the fees in question, until he had satisfied himself that he was legally entitled to receive them. As many of the services required of him under the Territorial Laws, are compensated by fees; when performed by the Justices of the peace, the result would have been, had he undertaken to give his Labour, in such cases, gratis, that the business of a magistrate would have been thrown upon his hands in addition to his other functions; for parties would not only have prefferred applying to the quarter where no expense was to be incurred, but would also for the same reason have multiplied the calls upon him. I am aware that the Act of taking the fees would not be sufficiently Justified by these reasons, and could only be sanctioned by the authority of Law; This authority seems to be given with sufficient explicitness in the Law referred to. Genl Call, however, and Mº Macon, the District Attorney, who it is not to be concealed, have long manifested a decided personal hostility towards the Judge, have been loud and violent in accusing him of corruption in Office, and of having extorted fees from persons doing business before him, which he was not by Law entitled to demand. The case appears to be one of mere difference of opinion. The ambiguities and contradictions which have characterised the Enactments of the Legislative Council has been a subject of general complaint and the present case has
<pb#436/>
partly arisen from this careless Legislation; for we find two parties, thus widely differing in their interpretation of the same Law, and is also partly the result of private animosity and pique.
That the salary of the Judges of the Territory is very inadequate is generally admitted. As Judge Smith has a large family to support, I sincerely hope that his compensation will be increased by Congress.
I have been induced to trouble you with this exposition, in the hope that should his case come before you, the facts above detailed might assist you in forming a correct opinion upon it, and also with a view of tendering my humble testimony in favor of an able and meritorious public Officer, whose conduct has been constantly under my observation and has as constantly elicited my approbation.
Judge Smith has given general satisfaction by his conduct on the Bench and has but few enemies in the Territory; these, however, are violent and implacable and are not without influence, and seem determined to leave no effort untried to hurl him from his Office.
The people here are greatly interested for him, and have forwarded petitions and representations in his favor which doubtless by this time have reached Congress.”
Trusting that you will excuse these hasty lines I will no longer intrude upon your valuable time, but subscribe myself with great respect and esteem Your Obedt. Servt.

cannot be, at this time reversed—But such aid as the Secretary feels himself justified in granting to you, he will cheerfully extend. He has directed me to prepare a Commission for Major John Phagan, as Sub-agent, and to direct him to report himself to you. You will consider him as attached to your Superintendency, and his services, as being at your command in what ever branch of it you may have need of them to aid you in the execution of your duties. You will be allowed also, at the rate of one hundred Dollars per annum for Office rent and Stationary—this sum you will add in your returns as a contingent item which will be acted on with your quarterly accounts.
You will be held accountable for all monies which you may receive on account of your Superintendency, as a matter of course—no special compensation can be allowed for either the “risque or trouble”—This is understood to be embraced in your pay as Superintendent.
It is hoped the relief which the services of the Sub-Agent, may afford you, and the allowance for office rent and Stationary may make the duties of your Superintendency lighter and more acceptable.
You will pay Majº Phagan at the rate of five hundred Dollars per annum."—

<docbody>Co" THOMAS L. M*KENNY General Super" of Indian Affairs SIR. If any treaty should be made with the Creek Indians, I have but little doubt that the Simenole nation could be induced to go with them if I was authorised to hold a treaty—I would advise that five of the Siminole chiefs such as I know have influce, be permitted to visit Washington, for I consider it important that the Secretary should converse with them and assertain their views & disposition and the sooner the better—-4% would it not be proper for the Secretary to write in the mean time to General Gains requesting him, to send to me a deputation of some infuential cheifs from the Creek nation to confer and induce the Siminoles to emigrate with them should they
<pb#438/>
be removed,” I will accompany the chiefs to the Indian boundary and have the nation assembed to meet them in conference
4t I strongly advise that the Florida Indians be encourged to sell all their slaves—I am conviced that it is oweing to them that the Indians have not acted properly—the negroes have unbounded influence over them and are much more hostile to the white people than their masters—The Indians exercise no controle over their slaves, and they derive no advantage from their labour One Chief who has 70 slaves has not raised corn to feed his own family These negroes trade in whisky which they slyly introduce among the Indians and sell at one dollar a quart Should the indians emigrate the Government ought not to admit negros to go with them, Much mischief will arrise to the United States if their slaves should accompany them, if large bodes of Indians should be thrown together I have never premitted in a single instance any white man to purchase a negro of an Indian.
but I am convinced the sooner they dispose of them the better—
I have mentioned these subjects for the sole purpose of calling the attention of the War Department to them and I shall not take any steps in relation to these matters, untill the Secretary of War shall advise me of his opinion and wishes, as to the views I have submitted”

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY ROBERT MITCHEL AND OTHERS</dochead>

<place-time>(January 16, 1826)</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled The Memorial of Robert Mitchel, on behalf of himself and others respectively sheweth.
That your Memorialists are Proprietors of a large Tract of Land in Florida, commonly Known by the name of “Forbes Purchase”, the titles to which were originally made to the said Forbes & Co, by con-
<pb#441/>
current deeds of the Spanish Government and Seminole Indians, and are of record in the archives of Florida "-
Your Memorialists further shew that the original deeds of conveyance of the said Lands, together with other documentary evidence, hereinafter referred to, have been submitted to the investigation of the Land-Commissioners appointed by Congress for this purpose, by whom their authenticity has been recognized, and they beg to refer to the report of the said Land Commissioners in this behalf 79–
That the regularity and genuineness of the said documents having been admitted by the said report, no question remained, as to the validity of the title of your Memorialists, except that which arose from the doubts entertained by the commissioners, as to the powers of Spanish Governors; doubts which they were incapable of solving, from the want of access to the Spanish laws.-
That it is with the view of removing these doubts, and of placing their claim on the clear and unquestionable footing on which they think it is entitled to stand, that your Memorialists beg leave to submit herewith “the laws of Spain in relation to disposing of Government lands” in an authorized translation from the Department of State;
by a reference to which your Memorialists submit it will appear that
“the exclusive power to grant, sell and compromise for the public lands” was in 1754 deputed from the King,” and for the declared object of “sparing his subjects the expense and inconvenience of applying for lands to his Royal person” and in which it is provided that the “power of appointing subdelegate Judges, to sell and compromise for the lands and uncultivated parts of the said dominions shall belong exclusively to the Vice-roys and Presidents”; and that
“those whom the said Vice-roys and Prisidents shall hereafter appoint, may subdelegate their commissions to others, for the distant parts and Provinces of their stations” and that “in the distant parts where the sea intervenes confirmations shall be issued by their Governors;”
and again, in the year 1786, that it was decreed that “the Indendants shall be the exclusive Judges of the causes and questions that may arise in the District of their Provinces, about the sale composition and grant of Royal lands &c.” “all of which absolute powers, and independently of the King, to make grants, sales and compromises of the public lands, and to decide all questions thereon, Your Memorialists submit were vested in the Vice roys and Presidents, and their subdelegates, and also in the Governors and Intendants, as will more
<pb#442/>
418 T E R F I TO RIA L PA P E R S fully and at large appear by a reference to the said Spanish Code submitted herewith—
And your Memorialists further submit that the said commissioners in their report allege, that in so far as the title to the said lands is dependent upon a conveyance from the Indians that they (the Indians) were incompetent to make a conveyance, to be held and possessed in full right and entire property. And such is the beleif of your memorialists, for according to the doctrines maintained by the Supreme Court the Sovreign, and not the Indians is competent to authorize a “complete ultimate” title. That the Indians however had in this case rights which were susceptible of conveyance your Memorialists submit was acknowledged by the King; for in the treaty between Spain and the Seminoles made at Pensacola in 1784 (State papers vol. 10) * it is declared that “his Catholic Majesty does not exact from the nations of Indians, any lands to form establishments to the prejudice of the rights of those who enjoy them” but “we promise in his royal name the Security and Guaranty of those which they actually hold according to the right of property with which they possess them.” In regard to the exact interest here guaranteed by Spain to the Indians your Memorialists submit that it is not essential, and it would be difficult to define it in phraseology borrowed from civilised Jurisprudence; but your Memorialists submit that all the rights incident to possession and enjoyment thus guaranteed to be held by the Seminole Indians, were fully and entirely conveyed by them to the said Forbes and Co.—
Your Memorialists further shew that anterior to the conveyances to Forbes & Co, the said lands were held by a tenure jointly between Spain and the Indians; and that if a conveyance of either without the concurrence of the other would have been held to be invalid for the establishment of a fee simple title; still it will be found that the conveyances to Forbes & Co. were made in exact accordance with this joint tenure. The Indians for a good consideration, and with the formal approbation of the Spanish Government, conveyed all the right which they on their part held; and the Spanish Government on its part, not only formally confirmed the Indian title conveyance thus made, but for a good consideration, set forth in the deed; “imparted full and direct dominion, so that the said house might as its property enjoy, possess, sell and alienate; provided “the land be not disposed of without the knowledge or consent of Government”.
That the time occupied in the transactions which resulted in the said deeds of conveyance, was a period of Seven years ending in 1811;
from which period, the titles to the lands in question, continued subject
<pb#443/>
F I, OR I. D A T E R F I TO Re Y 419
to the condition set forth “that the lands should not be disposed of without the knowledge or consent of Government” until 13th Octſ
1817 when the Captain General (Cienfuegos) on the petition of Forbes decreed “a permission for the alienation of the lands” the said officer having full authority and jurisdiction for this purpose; all which will appear by reference to the said report—
And your Memorialists further shew, that with an implicit reliance on the good faith with which the said transactions were conducted, and which resulted in a title held inviolate by the Spanish Government and Indians, for a period of Fifteen years preceding the cession of Florida to the United States, your Memorialists became the purchasers of the said lands. That they have sustained great and irreparable losses in consequence of the stain, which as they respectfully conceive, is thus improperly cast upon their title; and that these inconveniencies are not confined to your memorialists alone; the lands being on a frontier situation on the Gulf of Mexico, population is necessarily retarded, and a check is thereby given to the rising energies of Florida Your Memorialists therefore ask from Congress such releif, as in their wisdom they shall think proper to grant *—

<docbody>DEAR SIR Permit me to invite your attention to the necessity of a mail route direct from this place to Pensacola. The trade and intercourse between this Ala County and Pensacola, are daily increasing, and require that a mail route should be established between the two places. the distance to Pensacola is something like seventy or eighty miles, yet it is nearly three weeks before a letter mailed at Pensacola will reach this place. This is an inconvenience that ought to be remedied, & can be remedied without any expense to the government. The revenue arising ea from the postage of letters by the establishment of this route, would be amply sufficient to defray such expenses as may be incured by the transportation of the mail along it.”
I have thought it necessary to make these suggestions, that the subject may receive such attention as it deserves.

Let me ask of you the favour to confer with Col Owen " on this subject; & if it should be thought that my information of the manner in which the Land offices [MS.

<docbody>CO" THOMAS L. McKENNEY Gen! Sup' of Indian Affairs SIR I have the honor to reply to your letter of 15” of December
1825 addressed to W* P. DuVal Co" James Gadsden & Bernard
<pb#446/>
Segui Esq.”—late commissioners &c.—I beg leave respectfully to refer the Secretary of war to the proceedings reported by the commissioners to his Predecessor, which were truly recorded by their Secretary, at the Treaty held with the Florida Indians on the 18* of September
1823.” The whole of our proceedings were public, and many gentlemen were present at every conferrence we held with the Indians.
The Indians never have complained that any improper means were resorted to, by the commissioners: But it is well known that many of our citizens, (some of high standing) complained loudly at the time, and since, that the commissioners had been more liberal to the Indians, than to their Country— and I am greatly mistaken if you do not find such complaints filed in your Office—More than two years have past away since the Treaty was concluded and the detailed report of the commissioners transmitted to the war Department (of which I retained no copy) and now they are called upon to make answer to general charges of the most serious character, and that too without delay ahd upon the information of some unknown, long delay,d volunteer gardian, of Indian rights. I must be permitted to say that it is at least uncommon, to arrain the veriest criminal, without specifying, the charge, and the name of his prosecutor.
Whenever I am furnished with the information received at the Department with a specification of the alledged “improper means resorted to” and the name of the informant, I will freely state the course pursued individually by me, in the conduct of the Treaty, without the fear of censure or the hope of applause”

<docbody>Co! THOMAS L M*KENNEY Gen" Sup' of Indian Affairs SIR Your letters of 12* Novº last "" directed to me and one of the
7* of December 1825 * directed to George Walton Esq." Secretary and Acting Gov' of Florida, I have now the honor to answer, your first, is in answer to a letter of Col” Humphreys the Agent accompanied with a plan of the ground and an estimate for a building and Council House at the Agency. I have instructed the Agent for these purposes not to exceed Two thousand dollars.
Your letter of the 7” which authorises Co' Walton to draw bills from time to time on the Secretary of War for a Sum not to exceed five thousand dollars, will be attended to.
I assure you that no extension of the Indian boundary will keep them from starving until their next crops come in—The Apalachacola Indians are in a deplorable State.—Three times last year were their Corn fields and fences Swept by the uncommon rise of the river—
All these Indians live on the river, and until now they have never Solicited the aid of the Government for provisions.
The old Chief Blunt and Tuski Harjo have just left me; they have given me a gloomy picture of the distress now prevailing for want of food. These Chiefs and their warriors Served with Gen' Jackson during the Seminole war.
In order to prevent the Indians from Starving, the Strictest economy must be pursued; and to do this, Corn and Salt, only will be purchased for them, unless the Department should authorise some Pork and beef now and then to be distributed—Small portions of either would be a blessing to these poor, improvident people.
The Indians have continued to fall back on the Settlements, and have lately acted violently in Alachua by driving a family from their farm, and taking all the provisions, and distroying part of their houses.
I must still say that a Military Post ought to be established on the South frontier of Alachua.”
I hope by my presence among the Indians to Settle for the present the causes of difference that exists between them and the Citizens of Alachua
<pb#448/>
424 7" E. R. R. I TO P I A L PA P E R S I consider a Military Post in that quarter as essential to the protection of the Indians, as of the Citizens, it would check in the bud any improper design formed by either party.
The rations which were received by the Agent at Tampa Bay, were not all issued to the Indians; but as they have been received and must be lost to the Government unless they are disposed of, I have directed Co' Humphreys to issue them to the Emigrant Indians in the most economical manner to subsist them.”
These rations are the same Co' Walton mentioned in his letter of the 18" of November last to you, as having accumulated at Tampa Bay &" "
I am not informed whether Co' Walton drew on your Department for the two thousand dollars which he was authorised to expend in Supplying the Indians with provisions—and if he did not draw for that sum, whether I am to consider the two thousand dollars as forming any part of the five thousand dollars specified in your letter of the 7” of December last.
A very small amount of Actual Cash has been turned over to me by the late Acting Gov". I am therefore without funds to meet many Accounts that have been presented.
Col Walton will, in the course of six or eight weeks be in Washington in order to Settle his Accounts—He has started from this place to Key West on business of the Territory, and will proceed from thence to the City.
The complaints that have been made to me by the Citizens of this Territory on account of alledged losses in Cattle and other property taken and destroyed, by the Indians, have determined me to attend and take legal proof of these losses, and to Submit them to the War Department.
I do believe that many who complain loudly have Sustained no loss, and that the Actual loss will be trifling—by taking this step all clamour against the Indians will be Silenced, and I hope the Secretary of War will approve of the measure, no evil, and much good may result from this proceeding—Those who have just claims for indemnity will be heard in a formal manner, and all who Complain will have a fair Opportunity of proving the injury they have Sustained—
If the Secretary should however think differently on this Subject I
hope you will advise me as early as possible.
<pb#449/>
Until I hear from you I shall so proceed in this matter as not to Commit the Department by any Act of mine !

As the estimates have come to hand at so late a period, it is very probable that no larger sum that that originally estimated for by you, will be appropriated.—I regret that you are proceeding to contract for surveying on the presumption that they will be made, &
must therefore repeat my injunction that the contract must contain an express stipulation, that no money is to be paid, until an appropriation shall be made.—
I think it necessary that the contract should specify the particular Township, Section & lines, that the Contractor is to survey, and that no contract should be entered into with any one individual, for a greater quantity of surveying than he can personally attend to, and execute, within the year.
You will please furnish as soon as practicable your accounts to the

<dochead>REPORT OF HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE TERRITORIES</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:AD 7)</source>
<place-time>[January 26, 1826)</place-time>
<docbody>The Committee on the Territories, to whom was refered the resolution of the [blank] day of Dec 1825 * directing an enquiry into the expediency of reorganizing the Courts of Florida together with sundry petitions from inhabitants of the Teritory—Report, That it appears, on examining the laws organizing the Courts in Florida, that some further legal provissions, respecting them, are necessary to ensure a prompt and efficient administration of justice.
These Courts at present have authority to exercise, “in all cases arrising under the laws & constitution of the United States,” the same jurisdiction as was originally confered upon the District Court of the
<pb#451/>
Kentucky District. And as it has been doubted, and if we are correctly informed, decided by the superior Courts of Florida, that they have no jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime causes—it has been thought advisable to define, distinctly, the nature and extent of their jurisdiction.
In the petition of Waters Smith & J. M. Hanson,” two of the Marshals of Florida, it is represented, that the Legislative Council, in December last, passed a law requiring that “all business confided to the marshals of the Teritory shall be transfered to the sheriffs of the respective Counties, in which the business belongs”—By “An Act to amend an act entitled “an act to amend an act for the establishment of a Teritorial government in Florida, and for other purposes”—
approved May 26* 1824—it is provided that the marshals shall also
“be subject to such regulations & penalties, as the legislative council shall impose, while acting under, and in virtue of, the teritorial laws” ”—ahd It is not perceived what authority the legislative council had to transfer from the Marshals to other officers, any portion of their ministerial duties—and more especially as the marshals and the court are appointed [MS. illegible) " by the United States, and derive their authority from them. To prevent all further doubt and difficulty, your committee have thought it advisable to make these marshals the only ministerial officers of the Superior Courts and of the Court of appeals within the counties in which they reside.
The Inhabitants of Sº Johns County in Florida, whose petition *
has been refered to the committee, among other things pray to be allowed the privilege of electing their Legislative Council. Altho' it has never been the practice to allow this privilege to the citizens of a Teritory, so long as the U. States paid the members of the Legislative Council, yet your committee are clearly of the opinion, that it should now be extended to the inhabitants of Florida. Your committee are aware of no sufficient reason why they should be denied the right of electing their own law makers. They are citizens of the U. States.
They look to be admitted into the Union—and it can surely be no detriment to accustom them, at an early period, to the various duties
& responsibilities of self government.

November 1825, was not deposited in Bank. This has been owing to the instructions given by you to the Surveyor General under date of the 16* of April 1825.” by which he is advised to draw in favor of the Receiver of public money at Tallahassee for the amount of his salary and Clerk hire. Having been informed that such a draft would be drawn, and the return of the Surveyor General from Tennessee (who was then daily expected) and not knowing the amount for which the draft would be given, I retained in my hands the probable amount which would be required by that Department, which now appears to be a much larger sum than that required. The Surveyor Genl having drawn on the Treasury Department previously to his arrival at this place, he has found it necessary to draw on me for only one thousand dollars. I hope this explanation will be satisfactory to the Department.
I was under the necessity of employing a gentleman to accompany me to Mobile for the purpose of making my deposit. My expences on this journey exceed $200. I have not given myself credit for this expenditure, but submit the question to you whether it is not a proper charge on the Treasury Department. If it is not, the profits of my office will not defray the expences I shall be compelled to incur.
The distance from this place to Mobile is about three hundred and sixty miles. The route passes through a country in many parts unsettled, and affording no conveniences or facilities in travelling.
Hence it will be imprudent in the Receiver to risk the public money on this journey without being accompanied by one or more persons, who cannot be procured without compensation.”

<place-time>WASHINGTON January 31st 1826</place-time>
SIR. The repeated complaints which I have received from Florida, in regard to the depredations of the Indians, as well as the obligations imposed by humanity, have induced me to address you on the subject of their condition at this time. The letters from the Governor” and the petition from the inhabitants of Alachua” which I had the honour to transmit to your department, some days since, would give you some adequate idea of their situation, and demonstrate the necessity of some immediate measures, for the protection of the agricultural interests of the Territory. Without repeating, therefore, the difficulties and troubles referred to, or dwelling on unpleasant details, I
shall endeavour to present some suggestions in relation to them, which might perhaps have some influence with the Government, in the adoption of a plan for their immediate removal.
Since the Treaty of 1784,” the Florida Indians, as a Nation, have not been considered by the Spanish Government, as entitled to any portion of the lands; except such as were occupied by their farms and villages, and in that only an usufructuary interest, subject to the paramount title of the Spanish Monarchy. Although there is some obscurity in the phraseology of that Treaty, such has been the construction by the Spanish Authorities, notwithstanding they have allowed the Indians in some instances to sell a part of their lands, such sales are believed to have been of their possessions, requiring the concurrence and approbation of that Government, to complete the title. Spain by the Treaty of 1819 conveyed the Floridas in full property and absolute dominion, to the United States, without any recognition of an Indian title, and under this treaty the United States are invested with full authority to make such disposition of them, as they might think proper, without being restrained by any other considerations, than those which humanity and policy might prescribe, and without consulting their wishes or caprices on the subject. You will perceive also, by a reference to the correspondence of General Jackson in 1821, with the War Department; that he gives it as his unqualified opinion that the Exceutive ought to remove the Indians from Florida. And although the Government preferred to treat with them in 1823, the right to control them is notwithstanding unimpaired.
By this treaty of 1824,” which was ratified at Camp Moultrie, 23 Not identified.
<pb#457/>
F L O RI D A T E R F I TO Re Y 433
they get four millions of acres of land, certain reserves in the middle of the Territory, supplies for one year, a hundred thousand dollars in annuities, besides the expenses of the treaty and its execution. The Northern boundary line is undefined and left in a situation to engender the most unpleasant difficulties.
By a statement which accompanied the Treaty, there were to be placed on the reservations 214, and unless I have been greatly misinformed, there are about one thousand remaining in the vicinity of the largest settlements in Florida; and where they must be reduced in a short time to the painful alternative, of submitting to starvation, or of supporting existence by plundering their neighbours, like their unfortunate brethren, who have attempted a residence in that portion of the Country assigned them.
From the documents forwarded to your Department,” it appears that the Indians contend for an extension of their boundary line, but by what rule, it may be asked, are their limits to be determined? If they were disciplined in agricultural pursuits, a definite and small portion of land might be adequate to their wants; but considering their habits and mode of cultivation, it would be difficult to assign a satisfactory limit, in fulfilling the treaty.
They have abandoned their lands, and are now subsisting on the bounty of Government; and by depredations on the property of the Inhabitants; from Saint Johns to Apalachicola, the pasturages are beset, and the plantations also, and no enclosure is exempted from the intrusion of these rovers, whose habits alike unfit them for assimilation with the whites, or for subsisting within the limited confines of this narrow Peninsula.
To releive the Territory from these incongruities, it is a favourite theory with some, to reform the Indians, and subdue them to the pursuits of husbandry; but however laudable this scheme may be, and consonant with the noblest feelings of humanity, I humbly conceive it can never be realized but by the distant enforcements of education. To change their language, reconcile their prejudices, and remove the barriers between nature and civilization, is a task of no ordinary difficulty; and it is easy to forsee, that whilst the Indians would be pointed to improvement in prospect, their white brethren would be doomed to a protracted endurance of those calamities, from which they seek to obtain releif.
Sir, under any system, whether dictated by the unavoidable requisitions of a coercive policy, or emanating from the milder suggestions of persuasion, there are invincible obstacles to continuing the Indians in Florida. Amalgamation with the white Inhabitants were in vain, – 27 See ante, p. 414, n.
<pb#458/>
under the difficulties arising from opposition of character; the measure of concentrating them is also attended with difficulties, as past experience has shewn; and if persevered in, the Indian lands would continue to be the haunts of runaway slaves, and be resorted to by smugglers and fugitives from civil authority. The removal of this people from their original range, and concentration in a spot far inferior in extent, and quality, to that which they enjoyed is a measure revolting to themselves. If forced within their boundaries by military power, no reliance could be placed in their attachment in time of war, but on the contrary they might become the pioneers to conduct an Enemy into the interior of the country. Thus circumscribed within an insufficient range, and under a perpetual struggle with their own propensities; it may be expected that inducements less tempting than those of hunger, will continue to urge them beyond the lines; but when the Government annuities shall have been exhausted, and they can no longer resort to a public crib, what would be their condition in such extremities? Conflagration and bloodshed have already begun, and I trust I need hardly point to the horrid scenes of predatory warfare that have stained our frontier history. An aggravation of the evils complained of, is inevitable; and persuaded as I am that the immediate removal of the Indians from Florida, would ameliorate their condition, and promote the prosperity of the Territory; it is my duty most respectfully to urge this measure on the attention of Government. Deprived of the privileges of the chase, they are wanderers in an inhospitable clime, to whom any change of situation could scarcely be more unpromising; Beyond the Mississippi there are extensive ranges in which they could pursue the game, and find ample scope for their natural propensities, whilst at the same time the paternal hand of Government, and of the Missionary societies, could, by unincumbered efforts, conduct them to a participation of all the benefits of religion and civilization. Nor would the effects of this measure be limited to the improvement of the Indians; Florida would be releived from a disease, which has preyed upon its inhabitants with a morbid severity, and the General Government would at the same time be exempted from the embarassments inseparable from reiterated complaint.
Although I contend for the right of the United States, in removing these Indians, to use coercive measures if necessary, yet I am not persuaded that such necessity exists. On the contrary, these people are distinguished from the Creeks and Cherokees, by a superior gentleness and docility, which would in a great measure incline them to yeild to impressions of persuasion; and if they are ignorant of the fact, that the hunting grounds to the West are preferable to those of Florida, I submit whether a select party of their chiefs could not con-

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to report for your information that I
have been unable to make any contract for opening the Road from the St: Mary's River to Wanton's, in consequence of the Bids having exceeded the Appropriation. Copies of the offers made and my correspondence relating thereto are herewith enclosed numbered from
<pb#464/>
440 T E R P I TO RIA L PA P E R S. best, by a close adherence to the letter of the law.—I have long since made myself perfectly acquainted with the Country generally & with all the Routes through it by which a Road could pass; and my Judgement, both for the goodness of the Route, for public convenience, & for permanence of the Road itself when made, would have led me to adopt another route; the increased distance of which route would not have been more than ten miles, if so much. A short description of the Country will enable you to decide the question. The Country between the Suwannee & St: Johns Rivers and north of Alachua to the St: Mary's River is altogether a pine Barren entirely unfit for cultivation or settlement, except in some three or four small detached places of the poorest sandy Hammock, which are not sufficient to invite permanent settlement, though there are some few families residing on them. Leaving the Suwannee River and proceeding Easterly, the land is rolling Sand hills with a stinted growth of pine for 35 miles. It then becomes flat pine glades covered with Saw Palmetto, and extensive Savannahs & cypress Ponds, in width from 25 to 30 miles, & extending from the St: Mary's River in a south direction through the middle of that part of Florida into Alachua; & I believe from the best accounts I can obtain this flat, wet, region extends quite to the Cape itself. Between this tract of flat land & the St. John's River is a Ridge of high sand hills or pine Barren of ten or twelve miles in width. This flat pondy country supplies the Streams which fall each way from it into the waters of the Atlantic & those of the Gulf; and although small & insignificant in dry seasons, yet in wet, rainy weather; are swoln almost to rank with Rivers. The Route which is designated in the proposals for the Road passes through this flat country & crosses these Streams.
From recent observation I am satisfied that Bridges on this Route could not be constructed at any reasonable expense, to stand the first freshet which might come; and even if they did, as for instance where it would cross the St: Fé River, it would in all heavy continued rains be swimming a quarter of a mile to get to the Bridge. In flat land where the channels of the Streams are small & banks low my experience proves that it is almost impossible to secure a wooden bridge at the abutments so as to prevent its floating up. This route after leaving the ferry at St. Mary's River continues along the
“King's Road” for ten miles, & from thence to Wanton's, there is not a single Settlement; and from the forbidding Sterile nature of the Country none can ever be made; hence no Road there could be kept up.–
The Route which I propose as being the best both for its locality, & for public convenience, is, to follow the “Kings Road” for about
<pb#465/>
St: John's River, and then continues southerly, passing along the Sand hills bordering upon the St. John's River to Black creek, crossing it at a ferry already established there; thence to the military Road leading from Pensacola to St. Augustine, & either continuing along it for five or six miles before turning off for Wanton's, or cross it &
go direct to Wanton's. This Route is one that would be permanent, not liable to be interrupted by heavy Rains, nor broken up by freshets;
Besides it would have the advantage of Settlements along the route
& would give to the inhabitants of the West bank of the St: John's River a Road, which they are now wholly destitute of. It would moreover open a communication for all the inhabitants of Alachua &
that portion of Florida by good Roads to the tide water of Black Creek, six miles only from its entrance into the St: John's; and at the very point too where the canal, if ever one is opened across the Peninsula of Florida, must be connected with the tide waters of the Atlantic. It will moreover have the advantage of repairing that part of the “King's Road” leading to St: Augustine where it is most needed, & which I suppose will be one of the objects of the Government to effect. From the St: John's to St: Augustine the King's Road needs but little repairs, as it is now one of the best Roads in the Southern Country. By inspecting Vignole's map you will perceive that the King's Road runs in a direction, to within 8 or 10
miles of the St: Johns, nearly due South; hence the route which I
recommend as the best for this road is paralell to, and is never more than ten miles, generally about five miles, distant from that which was advertised for. I request that you will be pleased to instruct me on this subject, and if sufficient confidence can be placed in my Judgement & knowledge of the Country, permit me to locate this Road according to my discretion.—I also request that I may be permitted to exercise my discretion in relation to hiring negroes for its completion, or to have it done by contract as I may find it most advantageous. And if the General will be pleased to give me early advice on these subjects, (addressed to me at Pensacola with a duplicate to this place,) I think the Road may yet be completed by efficient management on my part before the 30° of September next. I do not expect however to be able hereafter to make contracts on any terms whatever. The late sale of the lands & settlement of the Country is unfavorable to getting contracts of small amount made by responsible men, as they are now engaged in opening plantations.—
Provisions too are exceedingly scarce throughout Florida, corn selling at $2.50 & $3. per Bushell, with all other articles in proportion.—
I have not recently heard any thing on the subject of opening military communications between Pensacola and Mobile Point;
37.8835–58 29
<pb#466/>
442 T E E R I TO RIA L PA. P.E. R. S. Pensacola & Blakely; and between Blakely and Mobile Point; measures which I considered at all times of great importance, and more particularly so now that Pensacola is selected as the Naval Depot for the Gulf. But if the Troops should return to Pensacola during the ensuing Summer, they can be immediately after, even during the summer months in that part of the Country, employed to much greater advantage & economy on these works than on any other Roads in Florida; and that too at a cost which would not be at all materially felt by the Q" Mrs: Dept. without any additional amount being added to the appropriations for the support of that Department, L
an argument which ought to weigh much in favor of the employment of Laborers eleswhere.—
I have just made a partial Settlement with the Barge owners who transported the Military Supplies &c. up the Appalachicola for the two Regiments stationed in the Creek Nation. There is due to them upwards of $.6000, which I was unable to pay from want of funds;
and one of them represented his wants & distresses so forcibly that I
borrowed five hundred dollars to make him a partial payment & four hundred for the other. In addition to these accounts there is another for Stores now on their way up, of $.1000.-The expense attending this Route of Supply is very considerable being more than I had expected. There were but three Barges on the River, one of which is wholly destroyed & sunk from injuries received on the upper part of the River while transporting these supplies. These Boats & men were employed during the sickly season & when the water was at its lowest stage, rendering the charge for freight still greater, being ten dollars per Barrel, but I hope in future to have it done for Seven or eight dollars.-There being but two Boats however on the River that can be employed does away all competition, & moreover the distance is great, being upwards of five hundred miles, without a single Barrel of return freight to lessen the expense. I am so sensible that economy & retrenchment is expected that I always feel the most anxious solicitude lest that in being the instrument, (for I have n|o] free agency in such matters,) in incurring such heavy disbursements I
may fall under your disapprobation, & be deemed extravagant in my use of public money; but I am conscious that these expenses are unavoidable while the Troops are at such remote stations. The arrears of the Office under my charge have now become very considerable & I am extremely desirous to have funds to settle them fully up.–
I have completed the Inspection & received the Road between the Appalachicola & Ocholochonee Rivers, the contract for the completion of which was made with Mº Bailey. I have also inspected a part of Mr Bellame's contract & leave here for the St: John's in two or three days to complete the inspection. He has labored under many diffi-
<pb#467/>
culties owing to the very extraordinary wet and unfavourable year past, but I confidently calculate that he will have closed this contract, and also finished his contract from Picolata to St: Augustine by the first of May next; when the Road from Pensacola to St: Augustine will be complete. no additional appropriation for this Road is required.*

<docbody>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.—
SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith an extract of a letter from Col” Brooke of Florida to Col” Gibson, of this City, on the present suffering condition of the Florida Indians.” The correspondence with the Department for some time past confirms the truth of Col."
Brooke's statement; and it was in consequence of those representations that partial relief was authorized by you from the Contingencies of the Indian Department. Being convinced that the Country to which those Indians have emigrated is not suited either in soil, or salubrity, to their preservation, instructions were some weeks ago forwarded to Governor Duval to ascertain their dispositions in regard to a removal to lands West of the Mississippi. It is hoped they may accede to the proposition. Meanwhile, however, Humanity demands that they should be kept from starving. They are, where they are, by our seeking; and their Country was exchanged as is usually the case, by Treaty, doubtless, with an ignorance on their part of the nature of that to which they consented to emigrate; and erroneous information on ours, as to its fitness.
I respectfully recommend that the subject of the sufferings of these people be referr'd to the Congress, that such relief may be afforded, as in the wisdom of that body may seem proper.
<pb#468/>
Connecting the object of the removal of those Indians with that of their immediate relief, I would suggest that the sum of Fifty thousand Dollars be appropriated with a view to both."—

The sixth reason assigned by Mr Doyle in his letter of the 20°
October last,” to Acting Governor Walton (M. Doyle having been sent by that Gentleman to examine into the causes of the unusual discontent of the Florida Indians,) is in these words, in the language, as it is understood of the Indians to him, and in reply to his enquiries:–
“That the land allowed them by the Treaty was partly forced on the Chiefs, and that the Indians never agreed to give up their land.”
The Secretary of War, as well to guard the reputation of the Commissioners, as to maintain the principles which the Government expects its Commissioners to maintain in negotiating with the Aborigines of this Country, directed a letter to be written to the Commissioners on the implication contained in the foregoing quotation.
The Secretary of War is perfectly satisfied that the Commissioners took no undue or covert advantage of these people. It was proper, nevertheless, the implication being excessed, that the inquiry should be made.—

SIR, Finding on my arrival at the Agency that the Cheifs of the Seminole Nation were extremely importunate that I should examine the Country assigned by the late Treaty, urging strongly that it
<pb#470/>
had not been fairly represented to the President of the United States, and that great injustice has been done to them, I determined to act on the order from your department, to explore the Indian Country, and to report on my own examination, exactly as I should find it to be—
I have now the honor after a faithful and laborious examination of their lands for thirteen days to make the following report. The long Swamp which is on the right of the military road leading from this place to Tampa Bay, is the first land near the present northern line, deserving any attention. This Swamp is near Six miles long, very narrow, and entirely too wet for cultivation, except Thirty or forty acres at its Southern extremity, which is inhabited by a family of Indians:–I consider it of little value.—Okahumpki, signifies in our language One Pond, is an Indian town, the land is too poor for cultivation & there is very little good land in its neighbourhood—Pelacklakaha is a town occupied by the Indian negroes, its name signifies, Scattered hammoc; there is but little land fit for cultivation about it, and in the rainy season, the best of it is under water—Chicuchatty or Red house, is an Indian town on the margin of a large pond; it appears to be an ancient Settlement:-All the good lands have been exhausted by cultivation, and it is now poor, unhealthy, and has no water near that is fit to drink:-the Big Hammoc is situated near this town. I spent some days in examining it, and was greatly disappointed in its fertility, extent, and supposed advantages—The Big Hammock is much lower than the adjoining land, which is poor pine sandy hills, wholely unfit for cultivation—There is a large pond in the centre of this hammoc, with several drains, in the wet season;–it is the greater part under water: in the dry season there is no water except in this large pond—The soil from its growth of timber, would induce a passing observer to beleive it very fertile, but I found on examining the land in many places, that it is a light mould two or three inches deep based on white sand, and would, if cultivated, in three years become become a bed of sand—The whole extent of this Hammoc would not make more than a Township:-
there is but one Small indian settlement in it, and take it altogether, I feel confident it has been vastly overrated. I think that a man who is judge of land would not give more than One dollar per acre for the best of it, above high water mark, which would be but a small part of the whole Hammoc. I did not travel but a short distance in going south on the military road; I left it near Okahumpki and examined the whole country to the right of the road as far as Tampa Bay.
I visited every spot where any lands were spoken of as being good, and I can say with truth I have not seen three hundred acres of good land in my whole route after leaving the Agency. The lands on the
<pb#471/>
Big & Little Withlecoucha are poor, and the land on Hillsboro' River within the Indian boundary, are of so little value, that there is not one Indian Settlement on any of them—I did not visit Peas Creek, I had suffered so much from drinking water, alive with insects, from mosquitoes, intolerable hot weather, and my horses were so reduced by the journey, and the swarms of horse flies, that I determined to leave that point unexplored, having received Satisfactory information that there is but a small tract of good land in that quarter.—I never have seen a more wretched tract of Country, than that which I entered five or six miles south of Chucuchatty:-the Sand hills rise very high, and the Indian trail winds over an extensive Sand ridge for eight or nine miles; the whole of the timber for this distance as far as the eye can Survey has been killed by fire; the burnt and blackened pines, without a leaf, added to the dreary poverty of the land, presents the most miserable and gloomy prospect I ever beheld—After decending the Southern extremity of this ridge, I entered a low wet piney country, spotted with numerous ponds:–I had much difficulty to pass through them, altho' the season has been uncommonly dry;
had much rain fallen, I never could have reached Tampa Bay in that direction—So low was the whole country as far as the indian boundary extended towards Tampa Bay, that after riding all day and until eleven O'Clock at night, in the hope I would find a dry spot to sleep upon, I was compelled to take up my lodging on a low wet place for the night. No Settlement ever can be made in this region, and there is no land in it worth cultivation—The best of the Indian lands are worth but little:-nineteen twentieths of their whole country within the present boundary, is by far the poorest and most miserable region I ever beheld.—I have therefore to advise as my duty demands, & the honor and humanity as my country requires, that the Big Swamp be also given to the Indians, and that the northern side be fixed five miles North of the Big Swamp, and extended to the Okelewaha River east and so far west west, as to include the Big Hammoc:*—this line will take in no good land but the Big Swamp of any consequence, but by extending it into the pine barren five miles it will keep off settlers from the Indian boundary who would otherwise croud near the line, and sell Whiskey to the Indians—The pine barren between the south end of Alachua, and the Big Swamp is poor and never can be cultivated:—the distance is about twenty five miles—
The Big Swamp is six miles long and is about two miles wide and is healthy, high, rich land *—

<docbody>The Committee on the Teritories to whom was refered on the 14*
of February 1826 the Memorial of sundry inhabitants of the city of St Augustine in the Teritory of Florida,” submit the following report—
The Memorialists, in substance state, that the Sugar Cane will grow in the vicinity of the city of Sº Augustine and in other parts of the Teritory to as great perfection as it does in the State of Louisiana—that, as the planters generally in the Teritory have not the means of establishing suitable works for the manufacture of sugar, they have formed, in the city of S' Augustine, a “Sugar Mill Company”—and, the better to secure the success of the enterprise, they pray Congress to incorporate the company with a capital not exceeding twenty five thousand dollars.
While the committee do not doubt the power of Congress to establish corporate rights, for private purposes, in the Teritories of the United States, they doubt very much the expediency of exercising the power. The Governor & Legislative Council of florida possess a general power of legislation, controlled only by the constitution and laws of the United States, and by the right which Congress has reserved of disapproving their acts. They ought to be the best judges of the fitness and propriety of granting charters like the one prayed for. and it is generally a safe rule to leave these matters of individual monopoly to the action of the local authorities. The memorialists however among other reasons for inducing congress to act upon the subject, state that the Legislative Council of florida will not meet untill next November—and that some inconvenience will be felt in consequence of this delay—The committee do not perceive any thing in this application to take it out of the ordinary cases of Teritorial Legislation—And if congress ought to legislate in this case, because the Council is not in session, why not in every other? But this Teritory undoubtedly expects to be, and probably will be, at no distant period, admitted into the union—will pass from a Teritory to a State—and the Committee are clearly of the opinion that Con-

gress ought not to set up a private monopoly in a Teritory, which the state cannot alter & over which it will have no controll.

<docbody>ROBERT BUTLER Esqr Surveyor Gen' of Florida Talahassee SIR, I have to state, that it is discovered your Deputy Surveyors have charged for surveying the line run by Gen' Coffee as the south boundary of Alabama, in some instances where said line forms the North boundary of the adjacent townships in Florida: The same is the case with those surveys East of the Chattahootchie bounded by the line run by you between Georgia and Florida—As it is to be supposed, that the Alabama and Georgia lines were marked with sufficient distinctions, I can see no necessity for any resurvey of such portions of them as form the North boundary of the townships adjacent—There may however, for ought I know, be special instances where a resurvey of some portions of these lines might be actually necessary—If such instances were found to be, the Deputy Surveyor will have to advise you of the particular facts in order that you may certify them officially—
Mean time, I have to advise you that none of the charges can be admitted until the First Auditor of the Treasury can be certified that the resurvey was actually necessary—Your explanation should therefore be made as soon as practicable—”

The Smith" Shop is well managed, and the Indians have lately brought into it a great number of Tools to be mended Mº Ledworth.”
seems to be a good workman and attentive to his buisness, his Shop is yet in want of many tools, a list of which will be presented to you by the Agent and, I request you will enable him to purchase them in the North, as they Cannot often be procured in the Southern Country;
By the Treaty no provision was made to Supply the Shop with Iron and Steel, of Course a Supply of each will be required this fall. I
assure you that nothing is more difficult than to procure working hands at this place, and workmen demand high wages when they Can be induced to Come to the Agency, The Sum of $2000 will not be Sufficient to Complete the Buildings absolutely necessary for the Agency, if $500 in addition is given, with great economy and management it may be enough, but I assure you that this additional Sum in my judgement is absolutely necessary, when you Calculate the unusual expence, in a remote Situation, in a Southern and interior—
in building an Agency house a Council house, and the Out houses, you will find that even the Sum of $2,500 will only put up rude buildings The Thousand dollars allowed for a Seeth School in the Nation ought to be for Some time years applied to furnish Spinning Wheels, Looms, &c. that the Indians are now Soliciting, they are totally averse to a Scool at present, and it will be time enought, to attemp such an establishment five years hence When these people are Completely Settled And have good farms to Support them the best School for five years will be for them, will be to teach them the arts, and they will Soon learn the various trades.
I believe one of our greatest mistakes in Our attempts to Civilize the red men has resulted from neglecting to teach them first the Usefull arts, we Seem to forget that the wild and roving habits of these Children of the forest, can not be Changed Suddenly, it would be difficult to show from the history of any nation that its people, were summer of 1824, but my presence prevented it. I broke the Head Chief, and he removed to the Creek nation, where he belonged.
“I consider it highly important that these chiefs should visit Washington, as they have never been in the United States, and have no idea of the power or numbers of the country.
“These chiefs are disposed to do their duty, but are afraid to exert their authority for fear of a part of the nation called the Mickesuky tribe, who are a very bad set of men. . . . I have not hinted to these people as I was advised to do by your department, that they might remove to lands West of the Mississippi, because I
felt certain it would alarm them, nor would they be willing to remove unless the Creek nation would also emigrate. . . . I would, however, most strongly advise the establishment of a military post near the agency; this measure will be attended with many benefits to the inhabitants as well as the Indians.”
<pb#478/>
taught to read and write, before they had learned to make their own tools for Labour or Comfortable houses for dwellings These people will raise Cotton immediately had they wheels to spin and Looms to weave it, Would it not be of infinite advantage to these people if a wheel wright, and a Cooper was Settled at the Agency who would take the young Indians as apprentices. The arts they are fond of Learning and in a few years, they would have workmen among themselves I am more and more Convinced that the Slaves belonging to the Indians are a Serious nusance, they have by their art and Cunning the entire Controul Over their Masters the negros are all hostile to the white people and are Constantly Counteracting the advice and talks given to the Indians; and on Several occasions, after they have promised the Agent in Council to attend to his advice on their return to their villages their Slaves have persuaded them to disregard it It is a great misfortune that the Indians have Slaves and it is wise policy if our object be to promote the happiness of these people to induce them to Sell their negro" they are of no manner of Servise to their masters, An Indian who has 20 Slaves has not Corn annually from their labour, to feed his wife and Children. I would therefore urge that the Secretary advise them to Sell their Slaves as Soon as they Can find purchasers and Clear out all free negros from the Nation If this was done you would never hear of the planters Complaining that their Slaves were Constantly runing away from them into the Indian nation, which has been and is now the fact not less than four gentleman have met me at this place in order to reclaim Slaves now among the Indian negros who are in the habit of enticing them from their masters and hiding them in the thick hammocks I request you will grant permission to the Agent to purchase some of these Slaves for the use of the Agency or for his own use as you may think proper I have given him permission to purchase one and if your department does not think it improper I shall give permission to any white man to purchase of the Indians by going to the Agent and making the Contract before in his presence to avoid all misunderstanding or fraud Some provision Should be made for opening and Cultivating a farm at the Agency to Support the establishment and to furnish the Indians with Seeds and fruits for planting.”

<docbody>SIR, Enclosed you will receive Abstracts of my account, for the Court expenses of the Novr. Term 1825–
I found it not necessary to Summon neither grand or petit Jurors, for the two Courts held in Jackson County in the Spring and fall of
1825; neither for the two last Courts in this place in same year, did I
summon petit Jurors. I thought it proper to Save the government, this useless expense; as they were not ordered by the District Judge.
This is the reason why the Court Expenses, are less for 1825 than I
anticipated, when you made me the advance in Decr. 1824—The Balance due in my hands, is subject to be accounted for at any time, and will I presume be sufficient to pay the Court expenses for this year.
I paid John Miller the Clerk of the Superior Court, the amount of money as specified in his receipt, and had it with me when I was in Washington in Decr.1824; but his account was not made out in form;
it was therefore returned—He has sent it on to the Delegate from this Territory, as I learn—He is now dead—What ever should be allowed him on his accounts I shall expect to operate to my credit—If any more should be allowed him, than my receipt calls for, you will draw on me for the money, through the Delegate, who is endeavouring to obtain the payment for some accounts, that cannot be paid, from the regular fund for paying Court expenses—
The three items charged in No 5, should have been in No 4. but I
have cost the Commission notwithstanding, correctly, I believe "—

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of 29th Dec 1825.81 and 3" Ulto:*—
I am unacquainted with what means of transportation was provided for Colonel Chamber's command when it left Baton Rouge, but as it was a movement by water, presume it must have been sufficient
7* See post, p. 468.

<pb#483/>
for him to have transported with him all the Reg" Papers. It arrived at Pensacola in two vessels, a Brig and Schooner, provided by the Qr. Masters Department at New Orleans, and which I should have thought was sufficient. When the Battalion arrived at Pensacola it landed under the command of Capt. Gale, who remained in Command as long as I was performing the duties of Q'master connected with its further march into the Creek nation—When it marched from Pensacola I was unable to procure from the neighbouring Country the requisite means of transportation by land, and it marched with three Carts (all I could get in Pensacola) as far as the ferry where they were to cross the Conecuh River; the remainder of such baggage as was to be transported with the Battalion, with the selection of which I had nothing to do, being sent to the same point in a Barge provided for the purpose, from whence the whole was transported in waggons with the Battalion. I refer to the enclosed extract of a letter from Capt Gale for your further information on this subject.*—
The Road from Pensacola to St. Augustine, owing to very heavy rains, was not like to be completed so that I could finish its inspection and receive it and as my duty required I should be at Pensacola I
could not wait then and I therefore deemed it proper to extend the time to the 30° June next. I however confidently calculate that both this part of the Road and that from St. Johns into St. Augustine will be completed by the time I stated in my letters of the 10” Ulto:*—
Although the contract for the Road stipulated it should be ready by the 1* of January last yet I thought this extension was proper under the existing circumstances. The year had been uncommonly wet, rendering it impossible to work in the low flat ground until late in the fall by which much time was lost, and also in following my directions at different times designating the Points where the contractor should work; By which means the most material part of the Road was opened and travelled on long previous to the time when the whole should have been completed. In extending the time however I
shall require from the contractor to make good any part of it now completed which may by storms or otherwise become injured before it is actually received by me. I enclose copies of my letters to him extending the time on this Contract; and as I believe I have acted for the real interest of the U. States in this case I trust the General will approve the course I have pursued.”
I have the honor to be Sir, with Perfect respect Your Obt. Servt.

Daniel E. Burch to John Bellamy
(Copy.) Military Road, FLORIDA, Febuary 26* 1826
SIR, In consequence of the extreordinary wet and very unfavorable year, for working on Roads in a low country, in which you was required by your Contract to complete the Road from the Ocklocknee to the St Johns River in Florida rendering it altogether impracticable to work upon some sections of the Road I have deemed it advisable to extend the time specified therein for its completion to the 30° day of June next ensuing. This however is not to be construed as giving you any authority to defer or delay the completion of the Road until that time; on the Contrary, it is to be distinctly understood that the Road is to be completed in the shortest possible time from and after this date. I have also to advise you that no further extension beyond the time above stated will be hereafter granted; and also that it will be expected of you to complete your Contract from Picolata to St.
Augustine by the date contracted for. The mail having Commenced its route between the Cities, Pensacola and St. Augustine, under the expectation that this Road will afford immediate facilities for its transportation increases the necessity of its being completed.
Having inspected and examined the Road between the Ocklocknee
& this place Chiefly without your presence, it is proper for me to point out certain defects & deficiency in its construction, which it will be required of you to alter and improve; under that article of your Contract which provides that my directions in the construction of the Road shall govern.-You will find them specified in the enclosed memorandum which will be also considered as a guide & direction in completing the remainder of the Road under your two contracts therefor.—
I am Sir, &c. &c. &c. Dan' E. Burch Ass: Q' Mº
Mr John Bellamy Present.
Daniel E. Burch to John Bellamy Memorandum
(Copy.) [February 26, 1826)
From the Ocklocknee to the Ausillee River the work is for the most part completed to accord with my views & instructions; but the Bridge on the East side of Tallahassee at the foot of the Hill must be covered
<pb#485/>
with hewed puncheons or plank; and the Causeways between “Chaire's plantation” & the “Gum Swamp” are to be more fully thrown up and covered with earth; also the first one immediately east of the “Gum Swamp”.-
East of the Ausillee River at the “Cypress Pond” some more work has become absolutely necessary. The poles & logs of which this causeway is made must be more firmly secured & pinned down; and the Bridge raised at least two feet higher. The water in the late rains floated both up in such a manner as to render it dangerous & almost impassible. The first long Causeway (made of earth alone thrown up,) beyond Richardsons towards the Ausillee, is so boggy as to require to be poled. There is another shorter one on that section of Road in the same situation, & requiring also to be poled. About two miles East of Richardson's also there is a cypress pond which has been Causewayed with poles and which requires to be extended and to be more fully covered with earth. There is a very material defect in all the small Causeways thrown up with earth only, & in some cases those made with Poles, which perhaps did not occur to you at the time, but now that the country is filled with water, is very perceptible. These are for the most part in low pondy places having some descent or fall, of course the water naturally inclines to run off, and as there is no way left for it to fall off, the causeway becomes a dam for the water to rise to the height of itself; and in many cases the water is now more than a foot higher on the upper side than on the lower side of the Causeway's, making a break directly over them, washing away the earth and sand. This will of itself soon destroy the labour done, & moreover, it renders the Road in such places worse to pass over than if nothing at all had been done therein. There should have been in all such causeways, whether of poles covered with earth, or of earth alone, an open space left in the middle, (or in the lowest part of the ground as the case might be,) with a ground pole Bridge laid down therein ten or twenty feet wide, and the poles laid level with the ground secured by riders pinned down over each end, over this the water would have a free passage without either washing off the earth from the other parts of the causway or raising it in a pond on either side higher than the surface of the ditches themselves. This alteration must yet be made in all the causeways of a description to require it, and of which you will satisfy yourself by a slight inspection of the causeways themselves and observing where they have been washed.

<docbody>To the President of the U. States The memorial of the Planters & inhabitants of Sº Johns County in the Territory of Florida Respectfully sheweth—
That the Indians located in Florida near Alachua, are roaming at large over the Country, doing serious mischief to the Inhabitants by killing their Cattle & hogs, robbing their plantations, and enticing
<pb#487/>
away their slaves:–from time to time they have made their complaints to the Governor & Indian Agent, who are unable to enforce their Orders in the Indian nation for want of Military Aid;—It is well known to Your Memorialists that many of the Florida Indians are a turbulent, & lawless set who have fled from the Laws & Justice of their own Nations for refuge among the Seminoles—Your Memorialists who have from time to time lost their Slaves, have, under the provisions of the late Treaty demanded them of the Indians in vain;
their slaves are secreted by them, and all the talks of the Governor &
Agent, have been so far unavailing—the Indians have hitherto refused to deliver them—
Your Memorialists further state that without an adequate force, they will never be able to recover their property.—The Governor has told Your Memorialists, that he has frequently applied to the Government for power to call out the Military to scourthe Swamps in the Indian boundary, and to recover their runaway slaves, and that as yet, no such power has been given to him—Some of Your Memorialists have lately had a personal interview with Governor Duval, at the Florida Agency who has assured them, that unless the Government will put under his command a sufficient force to execute his orders, he must abandon all further attempts to manage the Indians, and Your Memorialists must be compelled to abandon their plantations on the River S“Johns, and in the county of Alachua, unless the Governor is furnished with the force necessary to keep the Indians in their boundary & to recover their slaves—Should Government withhold her protecting hand from the inhabitants of this rising country, Your Memorialists must be ruined, or driven to make reprisals on the Indians which may end in a war of extermination.
Your Memorialists therefore most earnestly entreat the immediate interposition of the President, and hope their humble Petition will be heard with attention & favour.”

<docbody>HoN. RICHARD RUSH Secretary of the Treasury—
SIR, Having been informed by the Hon. Joseph M. White, that impressions unfavourable to the Commissioners of East Florida, had been made by a recent publication in one of the public prints, of an extract from a letter purporting to have been written by a gentleman travelling through Florida, and also by the statements of certain individuals remonstrating against the continuance of the board; I feel that it is my duty to make a reply to your department, and refute so far as in my power such illiberal imputations. The most important complaint seems to be, that the Board have in their adjudications permitted counsel to consume the time of the board in argument (which made it necessary to have counsel on both sides—) which ought to have been devoted to the adjudication ef on the claims; and this for the purpose of prolonging as much as possible the existence of the board. It is true that most of the claims are advocated by professional men, who claim the right of being heard on such questions as might arise either as to the evidence or the merits of the grants themselves.
That the exercise of this right to present the cases in the most favourable light to the board, may in some measure have procrastinated and delayed the progress of the Commission, is admitted, but that it was a privilege that could not be denied or witheld, and is incident to the very nature of those claims must be asserted. This has been alledged as the reason why the whole of the business has not been concluded—
The history of the commission since its establishment, will prove that the translators employed could not by any industry, translate more than they have done, and the proceedings of the board in no case have interrupted that part of their duty—That the business of investigating and probing, into the secrets of Spanish grants &
bringing to light frauds and forgeries would not be popular with persons interested & that those who were the means of detecting and
<pb#489/>
F L O FP I D A 7" E. R. R. I TO Re Y 465
exposing such nefarious transactions would thereby make to themselves enimies, will be readily admitted and was reasonably expected.
That there are cases of a doubtful & suspicious character, and which have been held back by the claimants, in the hope that the business might fall into more favourable hands is confidently believed, and hence a solicitude for a change was calculated on—
Should those insinuations have weight, I conceive that it will be but justice to compare the report and labours of the Commissioners of East Florida, with the report of other Commissioners, and see how far they have fallen short of others for the same length of time, & further to examine the rules and principles then whieh they have deeided which have governed them in their decisions and should the subject be examined according to the said rules, the Commissioners of East Florida feel satisfied that they will be released from such ungenerous imputation—”

466 T E R P I TO RIA L PA P E R S. what I considered a trespass committed by Doctor James Hall—As the District Atty. was of opinion that Hall ought not to be prevented from disposing of the Live Oak on the Lands refered to, no prosecution was or could be commenced against him; but as I was of a different opinion, and as at that time several persons somewhat semilarly situated with Hall, were about to cut Live Oak, I considered it my duty as far as possible to put a stop to it, and enjoined in the hands of the Contracter the Balance due to Hall, which deterred others from selling Live Oak from lands the titles to which were pending before the Land Commissioners and the result very doubtful—
Persons claiming Lands under doubtful titles, are constantly endeavouring to sell the timber, and many have succeeded in cutting and removing it—I have at considerable trouble and some expence investigated many titles and where I found them unquestionably defective, have interfered and prevented the timber from being cut.
I enclose the claim, under which Doctor Hall has assumed the right to sell timber,” you will observe that the Memorial and conditional Grant locates the Land on the East side of the Road leading from St. Augustine to Saint Nicholas on Dewee's Creek—under the claim they were cutting Live Oak on Julington Creek about Six miles West of said Road, and I should Judge at least eight miles from the place named in the enclosed papers—Not one condition named in Governor Coppingers Decree of 5* June 1818. has been complied with and had the Heirs of Pritchard” confined themselves to the Lands for which they petitioned, I cannot imagine any authority they have to dispose of the Timber, until the Water Saw Mill is erected.
A person is now extensively engaged in Cutting Live Oak from Lands, claimed under one of the Rattemburys' grants, excluded by the treaty with Spain, and which has been presented to and rejected by the Land Commissioners—one or two Cargoes have already been shipped—I was not informed of the fact until a few days since—I
shall endeavour to stop any further shipment if possible and recommend to the District Attorney a prosecution against the trespasser—
I do not know a single instance where the trespassers on public Land, are worth a Dollar, they are generally persons without property and if Judgement was obtained against them, would not be able to pay even the Costs of Suit—Still prosecutions might deter others from committing like depredations—
<pb#491/>
F L O RI D A T E R F I TO R Y 467
I also beg leave to remark, that the District of Country from which timber has been cut for the last two years, is nearly two Hundred miles in extent; and the Public Domain cannot be guarded against tresspass, but at some expence; a tour through that part of the Country three or four times each year between the months of November and May (the Season of cutting Timber) would in my opinion very soon put a stop to these depredations—
There is some choice timber on the Public Lands, and it is well worth protecting which may be done at a small expence”—

with an account and certain documents enclosed “relating to trespassers on the public lands in Florida." I do not know where the account ought to be presented for payment, but as the timber on those lands, for the preservation of which the expences contained in the account were incurred, belongs to the Navy Department, I should suppose the account ought to be settled by that Department.

Supt of Indian Affairs SIR-I herewith transmit to you a paper, as a sample of the claims, which have been and are daily present to the Agent and myself for slaves, said to be in the Siminole Nation. It is these claims which have in a great degree, occasioned so much dissatisfaction with the claimants as will as with the Indians—I have repeatedly, urged on your Department the absolute necessity, of addopting measures and prescribing rules under which these claims may be decided–
I have with the assistance of the Agent, been ingaged for sometime, in endeavouring to convince the Indians of the necessity of bringing to the Agency all runaway slaves, they have since my arrival here dilivered over to the owners several slaves, but many are yet claimed by the White people that the Indians aver to be their property—The following questions are submitted to your department. First, are the slaves and other properety taken by the Indians from the citizens during the late war to be given up—and if so, what indemnity is to be offered to the Indians for the slaves Horses & cattle, captured from them during the war, which in value can not be less than $100:
000—am I to enquire in to the right of property—in the nation claimed by the citizens of Florida, which was held by and in possession of the Indians before the diliverity of Florida to the United States—and if so, how far back is the examination to extend—

telling them that the americans were coming immideately to take possession of the country and that they would take from the Indians their slaves, Horses, and cattle, and urging them to sell, in order to save some part of their property—and these advisers then became the purchases for trifling sums of valuable, slaves & other property—
which has run back to the indian nation, ought this property so obtained, under these false, representations now to be dilevered up to such claimants The difficulty and trouble which these claims produce is incalculable, I cannot consent to that sort of left handed justice which gives all that is demanded to our citizens, & which withholds justice from this cheated abused and persecuted race, I beg again for the establishment of a military post near the Agency—I assure you it is all important to secure the rights of the indians as will as the peace of the country "

To the Honourable Joseph L. Smith Judge of the Superior Court for the District of East Florida. The petition of Sam" Cook a citizen of the United States, and resident of the City of Sº Augustine sheweth, that Your Petitioner has divers slaves absconded, and run away, that are now remaining among the Florida Indians who are within the controul of the agency, of Co' Gad Humphreys, which said slaves, or runaway Negroes, the property of your petitioner, are accrued to him by divers purchases as will be now herein, hereafter set forth, To Wit, A negro Man named George, which your petitioner bought of Mº Peter Rodriguez (to whom it is avered said negro previously belonged) as fully appears by a Bill of sale made by the said Rodriguez to your petitioner bearing date upon the 20" of August 1821; a translation of which Bill of sale in due time (the original being in Spanish) will be filed herewith before your honour, the said Negro slave at the date of said Bill of sale, purporting by the tenor thereof to be about the age of thirty years, which said Negro your petitioner is informed & believes to be at the Big Swamp, where many of the aforesaid Indians are resideing
<pb#498/>
Also six other Negroes, slaves which were the property of an Indian Named Nacusily, who by his bill of sale made upon the 16*
day of June 1821. before Antonio, then Interpreter & agent for said Indians under the Spanish Government, sold, and conveyed said Negroes to Your petitioner, & one Francis Ferreira, a translation whereof, the Orignial being in Spanish will in due time be submitted to your Honour, the said slaves being named in said bill of sale and aged at the date thereof, as follows To Wit Kitty, about twenty One Years of age, and one child about Two years old, Peggy about twenty two years old, and a child about One year old—Fanny about fifteen Years of age, and George a boy about ten years old, Your petitioner also charges, that since the aforesaid purchase, all, or some of the Negro Women named in said Bill of sale have had additional increase in children, but how many, or of what sex, or name, or names, your petitioner is unable to say, but alledges that all the children thus &
since born follow the condition of their, or his, or her respective Mothers, or mother, That since the said purchase of the said Negroes by your petitioner, & the s” Francis Ferreira, Your petitioner has become the sole proprietor of said Negroes, for a Valuable Consideration by him, to the s” Ferreira paid for his interest, and which was accepted by said Ferreira in discharge of his interest in the said Slaves, which will in due time be shewn, all of which said Negroes your petitioner from the best information, he has been able to collect says are at a creek called Pea's Creek, or on the Waters thereof, and amongst the Indians belonging to the aforesaid agency.
Also a Negro man named John which your petitioner bought of Francis Ferreira, by Bill of sale dated the 6" day of March 1824.
who bought said Negro of an Indian (whose property he then was)
as appears by a Bill of sale bearing date the 8" day of October 1821.
upon the same day—the Name of the Indian, who executed said Bill of sale, and to whom said Negro belonged, is Enochee the s” slave at the date of the last recited bill of sale as appears by the face thereof was then Eighteen Years of age, Both of said bills of sale are now here to the court shewn—the said slave is believed to be at Topkalipeka within the jurisdiction of s” agency—

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to report, that in obedience to your instructions, dated Jan’ 5** I proceeded to Sea with as little delay as possible and on touching at Pensacola, found Col" Walton the Secy of E. Florida, especially deputed by the Gov" and Council to proceed to Key West on important public service; I accordingly received him on board and sailed as early as practicable, coasting along to Key West where we arrived on the 9” Feb” I am happy to state that the Sec’ succeeded here to his entire satisfaction and the interest of the Territory by collecting several thousand Dollars, due the same;
Our water being out and none to be procured on the Keys fit for use, on the 13* Feb’ we ran over to Havanna, to procure it, Col" Walton accompaned us; on the 19* we returned to Key West; found here the R. Cutter Pulaski Capt Polk; desirous to accompany us down the Bay; accordingly sailed on the 23° touching and stopping three days at the Dry Tortugas harbour, from whence we sailed for Tampa and, arrived there on the first day of March, Gov" Duval here visited us, from whom a letter accompanies this report directed to you.
We left Tampa Bay March 9” and coasted along to the Westward, arriving at Pensacola on the 14* from whence we sailed the 16” and arrived here this day.
From any information we could collect on this cruize—no frauds have been recently committed on the Revenue; but from the great facilities, presented to smugglers, on this coast a vigilence in the Revenue Cutters can only maintain such a state of things.
It is perhaps my duty to acquaint you for the information of the Gov" that the Collector at Key West has a Verry large amount of

<source>[NA:WD, CE Bulky File, No. 193:D]</source>
<place-time>WASHINGTON, March 18, 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>To MAJOR P. H. PERRAULT U.S. Topographical Engineer New-York.
Sir, Gehtlehreh; You will find here annexed an act of Congress, dated March 3° 1826,” for the Survey of a route for a canal between the Atlantic & the Gulf of Mexico. The act contemplates two routes:
one from Sº John's river to Vºttsassatissa Vassasousa Bay, the other from Sº Mary's river to the Appalachicola river or Bay. Both routes are to be Surveyed & examined with reference both to a boat canal, & a Ship-channel destined to connect the Atlantic with the Gulf of Mexico.
From the few documents we could procure thełł relating to the country through which these canals should pass, we infer that the Sº John's route will ascend, in Succession, the valleys of Sº John's river, its tributary Black Creek, the South Fork of this creek; then will descend, in Succession, Alligator Creek, Sampson's Creek, Santa Fë river, Suwanee river. The Summit ground will be between the head of South-Fork & that of Alligator Creek.
From the Same documents, the Sº Mary's route will ascend Sº
Mary's river to its Sources, then continue to the Fork formed on the Suwanee by A-la-pa-pa-ah river & Withlococha river, from whence the line will descend into the Bay of Sº Mark. From this Bay the route will run to Ockalockony Bay, & from this Bay to Appalachicola Bay.
<pb#501/>
F L OF I D A 7" E R P I TO R Y 477
Besides these two routes of canal, which are to be Surveyed &
examined before the hot Season of Summer, other Surveys or rather Soundings are to be made afterwards along the atlantic coast from S*Mary's harbour to the mouth of S' John's river, & along the coast upon the gulf of Mexico from Pensacola to Wassasousa Bay.
It is proper to remark that the Surveys, levellings, Soundings directed by the following instructions must be considered, only as preparatory to those which Haight may be performed hereafter.
Their object is, for the present, to test the topography & hydrography of the country, & find out the local circumstances favourable to determine the routes which ought afterwards to be surveyed afterwards more fully.
The Survey is intrusted to two parties: one which will perform all the operations upon the Eastern Side, a Second which will perform those upon the Western Side of the Peninsula. As their operations must be connected & directed to the Same object, we have thought it better to draw up instructions for the whole, taking care, however, that the Share allotted to each party Should be Separate & distinct.
Survey to be performed by the Eastern Party.
1° Eastern Section of Sº John's route.
The channel of Sº John's river, from the bar, at the mouth of the Stream, to the mouth of Black Creek must be Surveyed & Sounded, & the width of the channel determined for a depth of water of 9 feet.
Informations must be taken upon the rise & fall of the Stream occasioned by freshets, wind, tide. The minimum & maximum height of water upon the bar must be ascertained. The lowest level of the Sea over this bar is to be assumed as the plane of comparison to which all the levelling profiles under these instructions are to be referred.
A line of levels will be run from the mouth of Sº John's river to a point opposite the mouth of Black Creek, with a view to ascertain whether, to avoid the circuitous route through the river, a canal could run in that direction. Care ought to be taken to follow the ground which will require the least excavation & & afford the most easy cutting: an observation to be attended to in all the Surveys under these instructions. At each end of this line the best Spot is to be Selected for the location of a lock.
This line, being Supposed to cross the Stream & to Strike the opposite Side at a point favorable to the erection of a lock, will continue along Black Creek & its South Fork & reach the Summit of the dividing grethé ridge, between South Fork & Alligator Creek at its lowest point of depression. It will then descend to Sampson's Pond.
Here a Bench-Mark is to be made, which will Serve to connect the
<pb#502/>
478 7" EP FP I TO R. I. A. L. PA P E R S. Survey of the Eastern Section of the Sº John's route, with that of the Western; it ought to be placed at the entrance of Alligator creek into Sampson's pond. Both parties must therefore understand each other upon this point of connexion.
The extent of Sampson's pond, of that the pond at the head of South-Fork, their depth & content of water must be, if not measured, at least estimated, the quantum of water they yield at their respective outlets must be gauged & informations taken as to the variation of the Supply through the different Seasons of the year.
The Same computation, gauging, & informations must be attended to in relation to Pithlachuca Lake, & Orange Lake which lie respectively at the heads of Cascowilla branch & Orange Lake Creek tributary of S" John's river. These two lakes are represented by the map as very extensive; they must therefore be examined with a view to be used as reservoirs destined to feed the Summit level of the Sº John's canal. Therefore, the difference of level between these lakes &
Sampson's lake must be ascertained, & a line of feeder run from Orange lake to Pithlachuca lake, & from Pithlachuca lake to Sampson's lake. The elevation & length of a dam, at the outlet of Orange lake destined to raise the level of this lake & back its waters into Pithlachuca lake, must be determined.
In the prosecution of these Surveys, the nature of the ground must be carefully noted, as also the building materials afforded by the country. All the Streams which might be used as feeders must be gauged. These informations & gaugings are to be attended to in all the Surveys under the present instructions.
This eastern Section of canal being Surveyed, an experimental line of canal must be run from Colvill Old Field to S' Mary's harbour, &
commencing at a point of the Survey along Black creek, & at a Bench-
Mark left there for the purpose. The object of this experimental line is to determine whether the canal ought to debouch into Sº Mary's harbour in preference to the mouth of Sº John's. When crossing Nassau river, it will be necessary to examine, in a westerly direction, the intervening ground between the fork of this river & St Mary's river with a view to ascertain whether the waters of the latter might be diverted into the former, to feed a Section of canal from Colvill Old Field to S' Mary's harbour. This Section is to terminate in Sº
Mary's harbour at a point convenient to the erection of a guard lock.
2° Eastern Section of Sº Mary's Canal.
The point at which the foregoing Section terminates into St Mary's harbour is to be considered as the eastern end of the Sº Mary's canal.
From this point, an experimental line of levels must be run through the most favorable ground with a view to reach, by a canal, the upper
<pb#503/>
F L OR I. D A 7" E. R. R. I TO R Y 479
fork of Sº Mary's river, & thence to the lakes or ponds lying at the head of Big Creek.
These lakes or ponds are to be examined with care, their extent, depth & content of water estimated, the quantum of water they yield at their respective outlets gauged. Informations are to be taken in relations to the difference of supply through the year. All these researches are necessary to ascertain the practibility of using these ponds or lakes as reservoirs to feed the Section of canal from S'
Mary's river to the upper fork of the Suwanee river.
From the upper lake or pond the line of canal must be continued, through favourable ground, & the lewest perht ef depressieh ef the ridge to the upper fork of Suwanee river; pushing by the lowest point of depression of the ridge which divides the head of S* Mary's river from the tributaries of Suwanee river. a Bench-Mark made there will connect the western end of this Section with the eastern end of the Section to be Surveyed by the party employed upon the gulf of Mexico.
The Suwanee, at its upper fork, must be, not only gauged, but also informations are to be taken in relation to its rise & fall at different Seasons of the year.
3° Soundings along the coast.
When the Surveys & levellings relative to the foregoing eastern Sections of canals shall have been completed, the party will repair to Sº Augustin to plot their work, write their descriptive memoir &
repert Send this whole, as early as practicable, to the Engineer department. Then they will resume their operations, & direct them to the Soundings along the coast.
The channel, from S' Mary's harbour to the mouth of St John's river, & running between the main & Amelia, Talbot, & Fort S*
George—Islands must be sounded in order to ascertain what craft it can admit in its present state of navigation, & also how it might be used to connect the two harbours. The bar at the entrance of Sº
Mary's river is to be Sounded with care, & the height of water upon this bar given fer at its minimum & maximum; the Same is to be done for the bar at the entrance of Sº Augustin harbour.
These Soundings being completed, the party will repair to S'
Augustin, report to the Engineer Department, & wait at S*Augustin for further instructions Survey to be performed by the Western Party.
1° Western Section of St John's route.
The channel of Suwanee river, from the bar, at the entrance of the Stream into Wassasousa Bay, up to the mouth of S" Fë river, must
<pb#504/>
be Surveyed & Sounded, & the width of the channel given for nine feet depth. Informations must be procured in relation to the rise
& fall of the Stream caused by freshets, wind, tide. The height of water upon the bar is to be determined for at its minimum & maximum. The lowest level ef of the Surface of the gulf over this bar is to be assumed as the plane of comparison to which all the levelling profiles, under these instructions, are to be referred.
An experimental line of levels must be ran from the mouth of the Suwanee to the mouth of S" Fë river, & along the most favourable Side of the Suwanee, with a view to ascertain the practicability of a Section of canal in that direction.
The line will then continue, along either Side of Sº Fé river, to the point where this Stream flows out of its Subterraneous passage, thence to the opposite end of the passage & # wiłł reaeh, through Sampson's creek to Sampson's pond & to the mouth of Alligator's creek, where a Bench-Mark is to be erected to connect the Western with the Eastern Survey. Both Parties must therefore agree upon the Selection of this point of junction.
By means of this Bench Mark, the difference of level between the Atlantic, at the mouth of S' John's river, & the gulf, at the mouth of the Suwanee, will become ascertained as well as the altitude of the Summit ground above both levels.
At the end of this Eastern Section into the Suwanee or into the Vassasousa Bay, the best spot is to be Selected for the location of a lock.
In the prosecution of all the Surveys, under the present instructions, care ought to be taken to follow the ground which will require the least excavation & afford the most easy cutting; the nature of the ground must be noted, as also the building materials afforded by the country; all the Streams which might be used as feeders are to be gauged at proper points; all ponds, lakes which might be considered as reservoirs to Supply the canal are to be examined & investigated in their extent, depth, & quantum of water they wettlé-preethºe can afford.
Having completed the Survey from the mouth of the Suwanee to that of Alligator creek, the party will return to the mouth of St"
Fë. From a point there, where a Bench-Mark must have been left, a line of levels is to be ran along the most favorable Side of the Suwanee up to the fork formed by the A-la-pa-pa-ha river & Withlococha river.
The object of this experimental line is to ascertain if whether a Section of canal could be made in that direction, &, at the Same time, to connect the Survey & levelling of the Western Section of the, S'
John's canal, with the Eastern & Western Section of the St Mary's canal.

2° Western Section of S' Mary's canal.
The party having agreed with the Eastern party as to a common Bench-Mark at the upper fork of the Suwanee (confluence of the A-la-pa-pa-ah & Withlococha), a line of canal must be Surveyed from this point to St Mark, & where it te will terminate into S' Mark's river, below. Sº Mark, & at a Spot favourable to the location of a guard lock.
The line then crossing S' Mark's river to a point on the opposite shore favourable to the erection of a guard lock, it will be continued to the Ockalockony Bay & debouch into it at a proper Spot for the location of a guard lock. It will then ascend Ockalockony river to a point, above Crooked river, where a guard lock might be erected, & from thence, crossing New river, it will reach the Bay of Appalachicola, & terminate into it at the a point favorable peiht to the location of a guard lock.
After having completed the Surveys & levellings relative to the foregoing Sections of canals, the party will repair to Tallahassee to plot their work, draw up their descriptive memoir, & send their the whole, as early as practicable, to the Engineer Department.
They will then resume their operations & direct them to the following Soundings along the coast.
3° Soundings along the coast.
The party will Sound & ascertain the minimum depth of water upon the bars at S** Rosa-Bay, S' Andrew's Bay, Sº Joseph's Bay, Appalachicola Bay, Ockalockony Bay; as also at the passes into S"
Rosa Sound, & Sº George Sound. These two Sounds, as also Crooked river, must be Sounded with a view to ascertain the kind of craft which might navigate their waters at the lowest Stage of tide.
These Soundings being performed, the party will return to Tallahassee, thea Send their report & results of their operations to the Engineer Department, & wait there for further instructions.
The general instructions Sent by the Board for the Surveys of canals & gauging of Streams must be attended to in the performance of the operations here above enumerated; but in order to lessen the time employed in the platting of the work, a Scale of ene four inches to a mile will be adopted for the maps & for the horizontal axis of the profiles: as to the coordinates the Scale will be one inch for fifty feet.
It is very desirable that the memoirs drawn up by each party should contain every Suggestion which might elucidate the Subject contemplated by the resolution of Congress, & be conducive to the best location of a canal destined to connect, through the peninsula of Florida, the Atlantic with the Gulf of Mexico.

Suptr of Indian Affairs SIR I have had the honor to received at this place your letters of the 4* * and 11” of Jan’ last º the first with a copy of a memorial from the citizens of Alacuha County—the investigations shall be made into the charges set forth against the agent and I have given notice that on the 23* Int, I will attend in Alachua at the house of Co" Piles to receive any evidience which the citizens can offer against the agent, and inviuting those who signed the memorial and all persons concerned to come forward on that day—I will in due time report, the facts & evidence to your department, you will see by my report on the quallity of the lands within the present Indian boundary that I have declined running their line untill my report shall be acted on and as a deputation of the chiefs are about to visit the President, on this subject, it would be very impolitick if not unjust to take any steps in this buisness—untill they hear from the Secretary of War the result of my report. I have seen the letter you adressed to Maj' Coffee, his name, is not John, but, Joshua A. Coffee—It is my wish to superinted the running and marking of the lines in person this I have promised to the Cheifs to do and I had engaged Majr.
Coffee to act as surveyor—The running of the boundary line is a matter of great moment with these people—and if I was not present they would be dissatisfyed. and suspicious of its validity, during the fall or early part of the winter the line can be run, but it is now too late, in the season to attempt it. I wish to have Majr. Coffe as Surveyor and an order for a detachment under some officer, with the necessary transportation provisions &c. when they shall be required.
I would prefer to be allowed to run the Norther line as I may deem

proper so as to embrace the big swamp. I am informed that to run the line straight in a northerly direction, would embrace a body of good land owned by individuals who tittles to the same has been confirmed by the board of commissioners I would therefore be best to frame the order for including the big Swamp, in such manner, as will enable me to run the line so as not to include any other body of good, land. (if your Department should dertemine to give up the big Swamp to the Indians) they should have it in my opinion, if humanity or justice is to govern, permit me to advise that the agent be furmished with so much of the funds, to be applid to the buildings of the Agency as will enable him to purchase all the locks, hinges, nails glass, crews, paints &c. at the north. this would be a considerable saving as they can be had at least 40 per cent. cheaper their than in Florida The Indians since my talk, on the 23 ** Feby last “ have with in a few days past diliverd up many runaway slaves—I think their is yet remaing about 20 slaves in the nation which they have yesterday promised to find and diliver at the agency in eight days from this time, I believe that my presence has done much to effect this and bring the nation into order, the circumstance of my viewing their lands, has had a happy influence on them and my report, if sanctioned by the President, will give to myself and the agent great influince over these People—I beg that the chiefs who visit the City may be treated with much attention and that their presents may be liberal, such a couse will forever bind the chiefs to the government, I wish you would converse a large with Co" Humphreys as to the manner these people have been cheated and imposed upon by some of the Inhabitants of Florida, The persons who have been most clamourous about their claims on the Indians for properety are those who have cheated under false reports, these people of their slaves who have since gone back to the Indians I
have been adjudicating on these claims for some time almost daily since my arrival here. The Justice which the Indians are intitled to they cannot obtain, while they surrender to our citizens the slaves claimed by them, Their own negros that have been taken from them are held by white people who refuse to diliver them up—I have felt asshamed while urgeing the indians to surrender the property they hold, that I had not power to obtain for them their own rights and property held by our citizens The government should have their property restored to them or pay to the Indians the value of it, To tell one of these people that he must go to law for his property in our courts with a white man is het only adding insult to injury I pray sir you will hear the agent on this subject who is possessed of many facts, highly deserving the attention of your [MS. torn] partment.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, by last mail, of Your Several letters of 28° February,” & 2nd 37 and 3rd inst.*
with their accompanying documents.
I shall avail myself of the earliest moment to Complete a particular and individual expose of the Several lines run by the Deputy Surveyors, respectively, to enable you to Scrutenize and Check my Accounts to your entire Satisfaction.
My future Vouchers Shall Conform to the instructions received, as the enclosure of Your letter of the 28* ulto; and every attention paid to your further directions in Said letter, with the respect to the
<pb#512/>
manner of executing township plats. The Surveys of boundaries, Meridians and base lines, and all other Surveying executed under the Contracts returned for indorsement, have been, and are by this mail forwarded with some addition upon the new Contracts which will be hereafter explained. It will be remarked that, on examination of the diagram forwarded you, an offset in the Parallel West, was made between Ranges 17 and 18, hence the Supposed error in Vouchers N° 7 and 8 will be Seen to be Correct, as the west boundary of Township 5 Range 17, N° and West, is not the east boundary of Tow 5
Range 18 Nº and West,-account for the 2nd quarter 1825–
I refer you to the enclosed Certificate,” as the answer to yours of the 2nd inst, that of the 3rd merely enclosed a Statement of Surveys deficient in Yº Office at that time, which I hope you have been in the regular receipt of, by every mail from this place.
I informed you in my last letter that, I Feeeived would answer Yours of the 25* Jan’ last" by Succeeding mail, In the performance of this duty. I have to remark in the beginning, that part of your letter has given rise to painful feelings, and I sincerely hope, unintentional on Your part, You express regret, that I should proceed to Contract for Surveying on the presumption that the appropriation would be made on the estimate forwarded by me; permet me to remark that I made those Contracts under your reiterated instructions to have the quantity of land Contracted for and Surveyed within the year. The fourth paragraph of Your letter is, “I think it necessary that the Contract should Specify the particular township, ahd Section
& lines, that the Contractor, is to Survey; and that no Contract should be entered into with any one individual, for a greater quantity of Surveying than he Can personlly attend to and execute within the year.” When Your attention is drawn to the law, forbiding the Survey of large bodies of poor unsaleable land, added to your Opinion founded upon my letter to you on that Subject, during the last year, I do think that you will see how impossible it is for me to designate the Township and Section lines for each deputy, but I presume when I shall forwarded hereafter at the Close of the Surveys each duplicate Contract, with a Settlement Statement of the lines actually run by each Surveyor, that your wishes will be entirely met.
Permit me now to call your attention to the latter Clause of that paragraph—And to state emphatically, that I have never given more than one thousand miles to any one Deputy, and they are bound under the Solemn obligation of an Oath, to do and perform their work personally, and the longest limit for performance was nine
<pb#513/>
months. When I Consider that I have never given rise by any act of mine to justify a belief that I ever did, or would, deviate from your instructions on this point, and that by reference to the Attorney Generals Opinion, (which forms part of your instructions,) in the case of the late Survy Gen' Rector," this Subject formed part of the Charges against him, I feel totally at a loss how to account for the introduction of that Clause in Your letter, If the amount of Contracts heretofore, is Considered by you too large, I shall be thankful for you to give me a limit, by which I shall be governed.
The duties incident to this Office Since its Commencement are now before you, and I hope they will bear the test as well in quantity as quality, with any other Office in the United States.
I have just learned that the Stationary for my Office, has arrived at S* Marks, from whence I shall have it Conveyed immediately, and will forward by next mail the Acc’t with a draft on the Treasury for the amount, together with my accounts for the Quarter ending
31st. inst. I am expecting the transmission of the Account for the repairs and transportation of the instruments &c. which have arrived, and the Account had to be returned to Messrs Wilkins & Linton, being interely informal.
The duties required by the transmission of these instruments shall be attendid to as soon as Circumstances will Admit. -
I deem it necessary to inform you that my Deputy Surveyors
(from information received) will generally have Completed their Contracts by the last of the Succeeding month, and if the appropriation is made by Congress, will be Solicitous for Settlement.
I have the honer to be with great respect Yº M.” Ob St.

<docbody>SIR. The National Journal of the 2* instant contains a communication from yourself to the President of the U States “ enclosing an
<pb#514/>
extract of a letter from Co' Geo Brook on the present suffering condition of the Florida Indians—That many of the wandering Indians and particularly those who have established their camps in the neighbourhood of the Bay of Tampa are in a distressed situation is very probable, but as their present condition has been ascribed by you to causes which conflict with a report made by me to your Predecessor in the Dep" of War,” I have to express a wish that the President of the U. S. would direct a reexamination of the territory allotted the Indians with a view of ascertaning to his satisfaction its capacity to sustain them—This examination will be unnecessary, if the objects now contemplated, that of a removal of the Indians West of the Mississippi can be effected—On this subject of such deep interest to the territory of Florida, I had the honor of addressing your predecessor many years since,” and at the late treaty “ some effort would have been made towards its accomplishment, if it had not been early discovered that the agitation of the subject at that time would defeat a hegetiatien negotiation on any points between the parties—The concentration however which has been effected; the control which has thereby been acquired and the present condition of the Indians
(if as deplorable as represented) renders it a favourable time to make the propositions and with great probability of success—If they cannot however be removed to lands west of the Mississippi the security and welfare of the territory of Florida, require that they be forced within the boundaries assigned them by the late Treaty—An Article of that compact provides for an extension North, if the lands within the limits defined should be found inadequate to their support, and as Commissioner for surveying the boundaries I have expressed the opinion, after a minute examination, that the country as originally defined was fully equal to the support of the population to be located on it—The sufferings of the Indians cannot therefore in my opinion be justly ascribed “to an ignorance on their part of the nature of the country to which they consented to migrate or to erroneous information on ours as to its fitness, " but to causes very different, and which a thorough knowledge and investigation of the whole subject can alone develop—
The history of the Florida Indians is not involved in the mists of antiquity, or need we examine old treaties or Spanish policy to ascertain their rights or claims—
The Aborigines of the Country have long since been extirpated;
The Seminoles or natives reduced to a miserable degenerate tribe, * Nov. 14, 1823 (NA, OIA, SW Lets. Recd.; extract printed, A. S. P., Ind.

while the disaffected of the 4 Southern Nations have innundated the territory from the Creek war of 1812 to 1823–; Hostiles acknowledging allegiance to no general government but scattered through the country under ambitious independent Chieftains—
These were the Indians who were constantly disturbing the tranquility of our frontiers; these were the savages who originated the Seminole conflict, and who being in the absolute possession of the country despised the power and paid no regard to the authority or claims of the Spanish government—This description of Indians occupied the most desirable part of Florida and claiming it by conquest they were only to be treated with on the same principles—Genl Jackson while Governor of Florida strongly urged the propriety of their being ordered back to the Country from which they had absconded, but the objections of the State of Georgia to having a part of a population returned to it, the whole of which the General Government was under obligations to remove induced the policy of concentration within the limits of Florida—
This concentration could only be effected by denying the claim of the Indians to the country then occupied and asserting the right and power of the general Government to drive them back to the land they had fled from, accompanied however with an offer, which was accepted, of lands in the Peninsula and which should be adequate to their sustenance—Many of them knew the Country, most of them had hunted on it, and though unwillingly, all did not ignorantly emigrate—The supposed incapacity of the country to sustain them has had very little influence on their present condition and their sufferings are such as have even afflicted a white population emigrating in mass and uncontrolled in their operations by prudence or judgement—In most of the negotiations with the Southern Tribes;
the Indians have been gradually confined to narrower limits; the titles to the hunting grounds first & principally extinguished, while few settlements have been disturbed, or those disturbed have invariably bore but an inconsiderable proportion to those permitted to be retained—Hence the migrating Indians besides their annuities and the value for their improvements received, were assisted by their undisturbed Bretheren untill they could make new improvements &
bring into cultivation new lands—The Florida Indians on the contrary migrated in mass, abandoned villages and farms which many years labor had improved, and went to a new Country—Delayed in their removal 4 or 5 months longer than contemplated by the treaty, they had little time to open lands, or make crops, while exhausting the subsistence allowed them the first year, and in some cases relying on erroneous impressions it was to be repeated for a second, they are left in the condition reported by Co' Brook—Disconted as they may

You will excuse my trespassing on your patience by these lengthy details—But it is due to my own character to place the facts connected with this subject before you, and to court further investigation on points on which I feel little hesitation in saying you have been illy informed—

[Endorsed] Florida—Inhab” Pensacola Remonstrating against a change in the territorial law of Florida prescribing the duties of marshall & sheriff—Mar. 27. 1826 Referred to the Committee of the Whole to which is Committed the Bill to amend the several acts for the establishment of the Territorial government in Florida “—(N°
73) Forsyth 17, CW H R same subject "
[Translation]
The undersigned old inhabitants of Pensacola in the Territory of Florida with all due respect represent. That it has reached their attention that Congress proposes to make a change in the duties of marshals and sheriffs of this Territory, which bill gives to the marshall the exclusive functions of official executive in the Superior Courts;
and as they are persuaded that a law of this nature will be not only
<pb#520/>
grievous but oppressive to the inhabitants of said Territory, and particularly to those in the region where the undersigned reside they pray to your honorable Body that it will find it convenient not to adopt it, pointing out in their support that in 1823 the legislative council of the Territory, appointed the said marshalls executive officials of the above mentioned Superior Courts in the same terms that are used in the law or bill that is now before your Honorable Body but in 1824 this same law was repealed as a result of the many supplications and petitions sent to the said Council from the different counties of this Territory,” which petitions according to the belief of the undersigned expressed the desire of the people of the Territory—
Being above all very evident that the placing of this duty in the executive official of the Superior Court bestows the power of exercising frequent tyranny over the people, and of confusing the course of justice, all of which would be without recourse if our applications to Congress were in vain; and inasmuch as the appointment of county officials has been until now well taken care of to the satisfaction of the inhabitants by his Excellency the Governor, neither is there any doubt in exacting cases he would give the same favorable attention in order to expedite them when requisite; presently they prefer that the sheriff's responsibility be subject to the people—than withoutit.
The undersigned humbly ask of your Honorable Body that in case it has already passed the bill that it be reconsidered, and to delete from it that part which concerns the sheriff or at least except from its operation the County of Escambia where the undersigned live: [This is] The only benefaction that the old Spanish inhabitants have asked for up to the present and do not doubt that they will merit the favorable action of your honorable body.

<source>[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:ALSl WASHINGTON 43 February 3 April 1826.</source>
<place-time>SIR By a provision of the 10” section of an Act “entitled an Act to provide for the collection of Duties on Imports & Tonnage in Florida and for other purposes”. Approved the 7” of May 1822.”</place-time>
<docbody>You will perceive that foreign goods, Wares & Merchandise cannot be exported from any port of Florida for the benefit of drawback, “unless the same shall have been imported directly into the said Port from a foreign Port or place”
I cannot see any just reasons for placing the Ports of Florida under those peculiar restrictions, from which Ports of the United States are exempted—these restrictions operate with extreme severity against the Ports of Pensacola & Key West, which from their local positions, are better adapted for an advantageous trade with the Island of Cuba and the ports of Mexico, than any other ports within the Sovereignty of the United States, and they would, in my opinion, enjoy a large portion of the trade of those countries, provided these restrictions were removed—As the law now stands goods imported into Key West direct from a foreign Port, can be reshipped with debenture, but if transhipped from New York to Key West this priviledge is denied.
It cannot surely be considered adviseable in wise legislation to retain a Statute which merely gives trouble to the Merchant, but which can be so easily evaded—for example, goods are shipped from New York for Bermuda, the drawback forthwith attaches, and the debenture becomes effectual.-These goods then can be again reshipped and arriving, would as coming direct from a foreign Port be entitled to debenture, when reexported from Key West, and the Merchants in their trade to the Islands and to the Maine, would attain all the benifits they desire, Thus you see the law can be most easily evaded, with this only inconvenience, that a Shipment from Bermuda would impose some additional trouble and expense beyond what would be
<pb#523/>
incurred if drawbacks were admitted on shipments made from Ports or places in the United States, Any increased expense that can be avoided, should be avoided, because every increase of it will have a tendency to place us on terms of less fair competition with the Merchants resident at New Providence.—
The advantages to be derived from this trade is of more importance than one who has not reflected upon the subject, might at first conceive;—The Contiguity of Key West to Cuba & the Ports of Mexico, gives it in point of situation a decided Superiority over Ports of the U States for a trade with those Countries. The Spanish vessels are in the habit of bringing Specie, cochineal, Hides, Sugar Coffee &c.
and in exchange require large and various Supplies of Articles, which they have been in the habit of procuring heretofore at New Providence and at Jamaica.--So important have the British Government considered this Commerce that for the last twenty years, pre-Port licences have been extended to the Spanish traders, by which they are exempt from all and every sort of Port charges.—But the proximity of Key West which is only about eighty miles from Cuba, a distance that can always be run in one night, induces those traders to prefer a commerce with it.—The passage is so short and so safe, and withal, every thing of risk from Privateers and Pirates, being saved they will always prefer it, while they can be supplied with Articles suited to their purpose. This though, cannot be the case uniess the priviledge of drawback is allowed; for at present, owing to the limited state of Capital and the facilities aforded at our home Markets, importations direct from Europe do not take place; the consequence is that unless Congress grant, the relief sought for, a great portion of the Spanish trade now so valuable to the commerce and Navigation of the US must continue to go to the Ports of Jamaica
& New Providence.
It has been urged that the arrangement sought to be obtained would increase the chances to fraud upon the Revenue; & that an illicit trade from Key West to the United States might be the consequence.—This certainly is a far fetched suggestion, and applies in point of probability no more to that, than it would to any other Port or place in the country.—The same thing might be imputed to shipments for drawback from New York, Boston, Philad” or Baltimore and with much greater seeming plausibility; because Key West being contiguous to the Main land in Florida where the population is few &
scattered, precludes every of inducement or attempt at fraud; persons being never disposed to place property, where there are none to consume and purchase it.—But besides this an ample & Sufficient answer to this objection is, that the supposition of frauds of this character goes to break down the whole doctrine and system of Debenture, in
<pb#524/>
500 T E R P IT OR I. A. L. PA PER S as much as its feasibility from any other Port is just as great as it could be from Key West.
I offer this hasty sketch of my views upon this Subject, not deeming it necessary to go minutely into detail, to one so familiar with the Commerce and Navigation of the Country as you are.—It is submitted not doubting that when you shall have turned your attention to the subject, You will readily perceive other and various considerations why the proposition to repeal or alter the 10° section of the Act of 1822 should be adopted by Congress.”—I have the honor to be, very respectfully your most ob" Servant J W SIMONTON

SIR, Your letter of 4* Jan’ last " with a Copy of the Memorial of Sundry Citizens of Florida was received by me lately at the Florida Agency and the causes of complaint have been promptly enquired into. I gave notice to the Citizens of Alachua, and had the same posted up in Six places the most Public in the County, and on the day appointed, a great number of the Citizens, many of whom Signed the memorial attended, I read to them a copy of the memorial and informed the Citizens that I had been directed to enquire into the causes of Complaint and I was then ready to receive any testimony that would be offered in support of the charges contained in the memorial. I have now the Honor to transmit you a copy of the notice, with the Several Depositions taken in pursuance of the Same together with the Depositions of John. Y. Warfield and James Hardage,”
which were previously taken at the Agency.
<pb#525/>
F L OR I. D A 7" E. R. R. I TO R Y 501
From all that I have been able to understand, it is clear to me, that the Inhabitants of Alachua were strongly impressed with the belief that the Agent had the right to call out Military force to execute his orders at any time and that it was owing entirely to his neglect that this was not done. I am convinced that the Agent exerted all his influence and power to controle the Indians and did perform as much as any other man unbacked by a competent force could have accomplished. I do not hesitate a moment in stating that the whole Indian Nation is under more complete controle, and order than any other nation of Indians that can be found in the limits of the United States, who have so recently come under our management. The Mickkeesukee, tribe I must except from this general remark: they are and have ever been the most violent and lawless Indians in all the South. They have Set their own Chiefs at defiance, and have abandoned their limits, roving among the white inhabitants killing their hogs and cattle, and pillaging their plantations. There is about 200
of these Indians that never can be managed but by force. Three times have they attempted to put to death their head Chief because he has endeavoured to restrain their excesses.
All the Chiefs in open Council have denounced them, and have assured me that if the Government, will afford them assistance that they will punish these outlaws, of their nation and bring them into their boundary. I have Seen many of them on the Suwannee and Ocilla Rivers; they are actually raising Crops in the neighbourhood of the Whites; altho I furnished I furnished them with provisions two months Since, when they all promised immediately to go into the boundary. Not one has gone nor will they move unless compelled.
I have been upwards of two months in the woods, regulating and bringing the Indians to order, and have completely Succeeded except with the Mickkeesukee tribe.
The inhabitants are greatly exasperated at the injuries they have Sustained from this tribe and the worse consequences may be expected. I acknowledge I can do nothing more. without force—no confidence can be placed in this tribe, and the orderly Indians complain as much of them as the Whites. they have most wantonly killed up the Cattle and hogs of the Nation, and will continue to do So. In fact their own people has Suffered as much from their depredations as our Citizens. If the Department is Satisfied that the Agent has discharged his duties faithfully as I believe he has, it will be only rendering him justice to make his acquital, as public as the charges which have been preffered against him.”

<docbody>SIR. The City Council have determined after mature deliberation and examination of the Subject that the most eligible point on the St. Sebastian River for the termination of the Tallahassee road under present circumstances is at Wiel's Ferry nearly opposite the Western end of Bridge Street, (a few rods north of the temporary foot Bridge built by Mr. Wiel) extending down to the most eastwardly part of the marsh so as to enable the Ferry Boat to land passangers or Horses on the causeway at any time of tide.
This place appears from an examinations of a map made, from actual Survey, in the year 1793. to have been at that time used as a crossing place. Although the Island may possibly have increased or diminishd in the size [sin]ce that time it is intended to leave it to the South; but it is desirable [th]at the Ferry should pass as near to the North end of it as possible.
By a resolution of the Council passed this day I am directed to communicate the above to you, and to request that you will inform me of your arrival at the marsh on the opposite side when a member of the Council or my self will attend and give any additional information which may be required: As to the Flat or Ferry Boat it is considered indispensably necessary as there is no certainty of the time when the Bridge will be completed.”

<docbody>SIR In reply to the inquiries you did me the honor to make in regard to the necessity of a speedy settlement of the Land claims in Florida I do not hesitate to say, that in my opinion all the claims over the Jurisdiction of the Commissioners should be refered to the Judiciary of the Territory for decision. The claimants are forced every year to make sales of some part of their lands and in proportion to the uncertainty of the title a corresponding dimunition of price which multiplies the number of petitioners to the next Congress, prevents the United States from selling at a fair price, and consequently retards population; every delay in the adjustment of land claims is injurious to the claimants and to the Government In East Florida there are numerous large claims on which reports have been made and which are now before Congress and unless they adopt some satisfactory mode of ascertaining their validity by Courts or Committees the Country will be greatly retarded in its progress, honest claimants materially injured and dishonest ones benefitted by selling imperfect and invalid titles. In relation to the Claim of John Forbes & Co. I
have to observe the reasons for a speedy settlement of that, derive Tº A Senator of the United States from Georgia.

<docbody>THE HON HENRY CLAY Secretary of State SIR, The record of a proceeding, which was a rule of court made at the November Term of the Superiour court of E. Fa. 1825, Haade against me fer to shew cause why I should not be dismissed from the bar of said court as an attorney and counsellor at Law, which was perferred by Judge Smith who then presided, though upon the complaint of no individual whatever, and sustained chiefly upon his own affidavits, having been submitted & forwarded to your department by Judge Smith, I beg the privilege of urging a further defence, as the question now stands whether I am to be dismissed as an officer of government, from any thing that is alleged or proved by the record—I
more earnestly ask this privilege as much, that I now state, would have been tantamount to a contempt of court had it been used or applied when Judge Smith himself presided—as the Judge—though I
contend that my answer exhibited in court was a complete & sufficient defence to have exonerated me from any charge of improper conduct as an attorney or man. Believing that the privilege I ask will be extended and a more patient and less prejudiced hearing now given me I proceed to reply to the charges as exhibited—
The first charge is one that I cannot conceive how an attorney can be guilty of—he is not bound by his oath to conceal any secret of a Jury for none so far as I have been acquainted with him have ever been confided to him, and though in some courts he may be allowed to appear before them to present them bills of indictment or when sent for, to instruct them on points of Law, as is the case and practiſee) in E. Florida, yet he is never, even there, allowed to be a witness of any their deliberations, When a jury has made a presentment in court, it is a matter of publicity & any one is at liberty to speak of it, the same must have been known to the court & to every other person
<pb#531/>
F L O RI D A 7" E R F I TO R Y 507
in Florida, yet eighteen months after the conversation between Col Humpheys and Judge Smith, my speaking of that which was known to all, is deemed an offence. I called on to answer for it, an affidavit of Judge Smith stating what he had heard is made evidence against me, which affidavit is not corroborated by the evidence of Col. Humphreys, with from whom it is stated that Judge Smith derives his information—
To the second charge I must repeat that the court at the May Term
1824, was opened both as a U States court & a territorial court, that the grand Jury when impannelled Sworn & charged, were considered and treated as one and the same during the time they were in session that the session lasted from the 3° till the 18* of May, that my attendance on behalf of the U. States during the whole of the session was indispensably necessary, as in that time any offence against the laws of the U. S. might be enquired into by the Jury, and that consequently I was entitled to demand & receive the legal allowance—So far as I
have been able to learn it has been and still is the practice of all U. S.
Attys throughout the States to charge for each day of a term, whether their be public business or not, proceeding upon the principle that their services may be required, Here it is evident that I wished to receive compensation for such time only as when they appeared in court— and when it is considered that the G. Juries of the Superiour court of E. Fa adjourn and sit at their pleasure & a mistake of two days might easily be made, Mr. Gould who on this occasion volunteered his affidavit states that the Jury appeared in court seven days—If this charge made by me was improper why was I not notified of it at the time and why was it permitted to pass unnoticed for two years—
It ought to be remembered that it was presented, as I know it must be—to the court for its sanction—how then could I be so simple as attempt to commit & practice a fraud that insured from itself immediate detection—In my construction of the Laws on this subject I
might have been in error though I still believe I was not, the Judge must have so considered or why was my intentions called in question at this remote period—and the public suffered to retain an officer So unworthy his trust, for two years—I may be pardoned for also remarking that in each of the territories and especially in Florida it was supposed by all officers till September 1824, that the territorial business was to be considered as U. S. business and they charged accordingly as will appear by a reference to the Comptrollers office—
In answer to the third charge I say that no contempt or disrespect on my part was intended to be offered to Judge Smith I had been requested by the Collector of Key West to file a libel against a bag of Coffee he had seized for a breach of the Revenue Laws, at first I resolved in consequence of the remote distance of Key West the

The libel and note was placed in the hands of one Dennis, (who though unhappily addicted to intemperance, yet when sober is faithful & respectful in his deportment, had been as then was retained by me as a servant to attend about my office and was frequently employed for such purposes by the gentlemen of the place, and then as he seemed to me and as I believed; & was perfectly sober, who in a short time returned and said he delivered the papers which I expected he would have brought back, nevertheless I determined to call for them but before I could do so the marshal had left the place unexpectedly to me on the evening ef after the morning on which I had sent the libel, when for reasons before alleged I concluded to abandon the matter—Judge Smith says that I sent the libel to him on the 10* I am positive I did not & that it was on the ninth, the tenth was Sunday as appears from the Almanac which shews that the Judge Haight may at times be mistaken in his recollections or at times commit a blunder—I am certain likewise that it not necessary for me in this case to appear before the Judge in proper person as he contends the business could be transacted by note & if the one sent on this occasion was at all improper why was it not exhibited—for it seems that every line I ever wrote has been carefully preserved—As it regards my saying that Judge Smith did not seem disposed to transact business with me in the same manner as with other persehs members of the bar, it was induced by a representation to me that Judge Smith had contemptuously observed that the said Dennis had been associated my partner but that he (Judge Smith)
would not admit him to the bar with other such provoking expressions;
which caused me to observe as much as I have admitted. It was natural that I should think so and the numerous circumstances of the Judges avowed hostility his insulting demeanour to me in the streets his refusing to give me such returns of politeness as are usual when gentlemen meet the constant abusive language he often applied when speaking of me, on this occasion might have been an apology for my more harsh indignations, but nothing of the kind is expressed, and all that can be shewn is that when I supposed myself aggrieved, I made to a confidential friend a mild complaint, a right that is scarce denied to the meanest slave in the most arbitary government—
<pb#533/>
F L OR I. D A 7" E. R. R. I TO R Y 509
To the 4* charge I observe that on the subject of Judge Smith having advised the course of proceeding in the Case of Tattnal &
Shearman I never spoke of it as directly within my own knowledge.
this the testimony of Rodman & Drysdale clearly shews, however the latter in his testimony may have equivocated, even had I have done so, I was excusable—for Major Clarke the very intimate friend of Judge Smith who was the principal council of Tattnal and who alone visited the office of the Judge previous to the issuing of the attachment in the case, ef returned and informed Col. Tattnal in my presence, that he, Col Tattnal had no cause to hesitate or doubt, for that he Major Clarke had been instructed by Judge Smith, how he should proceed and produced as an evidence of his statement Kerbys reports " which containing a case directly in point which he said had been furnished by Judge Smith who had the only copy in Fa—this statement Major Clarke frequently made both before and after the quashing of the attachment as appears by the certificates of Col. Tattnal & Capn Lancaster hew herewith accompaning & marked exhibits A & B and Judge Smith in delivering his opinion on the case rather corroborated Major Clarke's statement (vide Lancaster certificate). No contradiction of Major C. epihieh statement is made till Judge S. went to St Marys and procured Major C's own statemeht ahd affidavit proving him himself to be regardless of truth (this affidavit of Major Clarke is by no means satisfactory however—)
when some the is made, when & understanding that Mr Drysdale to whom in the heat anxiety of argument & discussion I had mentioned my confidence of success stating the reasons ef #y eehādehee why I felt so, and whose haiserable debasement situation in society I was willing to commisserate, felt some unpleasantness in being called on as a witness in the business, to relieve him from his embarrassment, I told him I had said that Judge Smith did in this matter give instruction to Col. Tattnal's Lawyer, I may have said that he did, yet even Mr Drysdale admits that I said I was ready to surrender Hay the name of my author and that if Major Clarke denied having said so that I would expose him &c, thus clearly shewing that I did not speak of my own knowledge—yet this most technical reasoning is resorted to, to bring me in into the definition of a contempt—or malpractice The fifth charge needs no comment or reply as Judge Smith himself there acquits me, tho’ I am surprized that if I made the motion in court stated, that there is no appearance of it on record where it
<pb#534/>
should have been placed—nor could any of the numerous bar remember that I had made such a motion The sixth charge and the seventh may be considered together they are so intimately connected that they constitute one and the same act—That there is any evidence to prove that I had any agency whatever in making the alteration in the execution in the case of the U. S. vs Perpall or that the same was made else where than in the clerks office where it could be legally and properly done it has not yet been exhibited, the alteration is made in such a manner that it is evident no concealment was intended, Mr. Tingle the clerk says that he is not positive that the alteration was not made by him, and but thinks that it was made by Mr. Wilson who at that time wrote in the office more especially as he is confident that the alteration in the execution book was in his opinion, formed from an acquaintance with Mr Wilson's hand writing, made by Mr Wilson if then Mr.
Wilson made one alteration the conclusion is irresistable, that the other must have been made by him also-The execution after altered conforms to my written memorandum left in the Clks office directing the execution to be issued, which Mr Tingle says he did not read when he wrote the execution which was delivered to Mr Wilson to record, Is it not then a fair presumption that seeing the execution did not correspond with my memorandum that he Mr Wilson made the alteration that they might correspond, especially as he made the alteration in the execution book which is nothing but a brief history of the executions issued—the court dwells much however on the circumstance that no alteration is made in the original judgment of the case, where five dollars, instead of fifteen is entered as the costs of the suit, this is an evidence that I could have had no agency in the alteration for certainly I was not blind as to attempt a fraud which I did not complete, or that I would thus foolishly expose the execution to be quashed whenever the opposite party might be disposed to do so, it was an oversight of Mr. Wilson a young lawyer indifferently acquainted with the rules of the office and its routine of business as is well known. In regard to my application to the Judge, it was made theer for a fee of $20 and not for ten dollars, not by & under the section of the law the ten dollars was received, but under the very section ef the law that Judge Smith considered himself entitled to receive & demand fees—as is expressed in the application and I deny that I ever had any notice director indirect of the Judge refusing to grant my motion, if I had why was this application retained by the Judge & not returned to me or the office—or why is this matter which it would seem has been known to the court permitted since December
1824 permitted to remain unnoticed till now when circumstances must be forgotten, & not brought up untill a short time after the death of
<pb#535/>
F L OR I. D A T E E R I TO R Y 511
Mr Wilson by whom alone the manner of the alteration could be proved—The fee charged in this case I was entitled to if not, the laborious duties of the office of U.S. Atty had to be performed without any compensation or reward, and the decission of the court in other cases confirmed the my construction of the law—Mr Perpall was the last person I wished or desired to injure or deprive unjustly of a cent, so far from pressing him in the suits then against him, I was anxious to extend to him every indulgence consistent with duty and my situation and exhibits C & D "shew that towards him I could not be guilty of any thing like extortion—
I cannot conclude without complaining of the manner in which the whole of the proceedings contained in the copy of the record was conducted, had an attorney of the court at the suggestion or the complaint of an individual have preferred charges against me as attorney, in the usual way nothing could be said, but no complaint is made no attorney steps forward to prosecute—Yet the Judge of the court with whom and myself there long had been a private & personal animesity difference, who made it his habit both in public and private to insult me by the most bitter calumniations, against whom I had been goaded under the excitement of such impropriety on his part to say that I
must complain to my government, makes it his duty business to collect testimony and affidavits from persons over whom he had the greatest ascendancy & control to justify and colour the charges he himself was about to make thus prejudging the merits of a case which he himself must decide, and further depriving me of a fair trial by superintending the examination of the witnesses examined in court, and by making his own statements evidence in the court where he presided, and even by sending for the witnesses summoned by me to his chamber to enquire what they knew of the case and when told, endeavouring to convince them they were in error or mistake—(see exhibit E) all of which is calculated to render any individual dissatisfied with a verdict pronounced under such circumstances, especially when by the direction of the court the sixth & seventh charges were referred & submitted to the grand Jury of the country who on their oaths could not say I was guilty although the Judge himself descended from his bench and appeared before them as a witness—
Had my means been stinted and inadequate to my support, had I
been pecunious in my disposition, had my character as a Lawyer & a gentleman ever been called in question, had I ever been guilty or charged with treating with disrespect any tribunal before which I
appeared in my professional character, then with some plausibility might I be accused of the petty frauds, if frauds they be, of the
<pb#536/>
malpractices and contempts &c, alleged against me, but I defy any man to say I have defrauded him of a cent or in my transactions with him have dealt regidly, I also challenge my enemies and every man has them, to say that they have seen me when in court treat and behave other than with the greatest decency & respect and though at times, I have differed in opinion with the Judge, (yet on my part it was an honest error if I committed one) it was done with perfect decorum and proper deference and the testimonies of distinguished gentlemen who have known me from infancy and associated with me as a Lawyer shew that my standing as such and as a gentlemen has hither to never been impeached (see exhibits F. G. H. I & K), 7 and the charges now brought forward if stripped & divested of their verbage amount in themselves to nothing, neither have they been sustained, unless by resorting to a construction & principle that would overthrow the very foundation of our liberties, viz, that every thing is to be taken in the worst eeustra and most constrained and aggrevated Sence & construction against the accused—
If in submitting the above I have betrayed any improper warmth of feeling, if any harsh expression has escaped me, I beg that it will not be ascribed to any motive of impropriety, that it will be rather attributed to the sense of indignation natural to the occasion when we believe that we have been dealt with and treated with injustice, which if it cannot be excused will at least be pardoned when the peculiarly aggrivated circumstances of the my case is considered—and the meanſs] that have been resorted to, to effect my ruin.

as to say what Majº Clarke had said to me; in relation to the same subject; I have to State After the argument in the case, I saw Majº Clarke who had appeared in opposition to the interests of Shearman, which I in part, represented: And I asked him jocularly, how he thought the decision would be: He replied to me, that he had no doubt of success; altho' I had made a long speech which had fatigued the Judge very much; but he said that all the steps which had been taken in the case, had been advised by the Judge, and he had no doubt he would and must sustain the advice which he had himself given When the Judge delivered his opinion in this case, I was in Court;
and on Account of the statement made to me by Majº Clarke, as well as for other reasons I was particularly attentive, to what he said:
I think the Judge did say; He had been of a different opinion from that which he then delivered, as the opinion of the Court, but from the arguments made, and authorities furnished in this case, he had changed his opinion; expressing at the same time a decided conviction on his part, that in all cases; it was best and most proper that a Judge should never give any opinion upon matters of law, except when they were properly before him for adjudication It is proper for me to say, this statement is made entirely from recollection, for I took no notes of the conversation, or of the decision which I have here adverted to-

(Duplicate.)
Having been applied to by the Honble J. L. Smith, & Edgar Macon Esq" to state my knowledge of the fact of the former having expressed a judicial opinion on any matter of substance connected with the case of the admor of Hamilton vs Williamson & Shearman (in which an attachment was applied for on the part of the plaintiff):-or my impressions, as made upon my mind by the statements of one of my counsel, Majº Clark, in relation to such an expression of opinion, I have to remark, that, with myself personally, no conversation, in regard to the case alluded to, ever took place on the part of Judge
<pb#538/>
Smith, before the granting of the attachment, or, within my recollection, after it was dissolved, except what few words may have passed in Judge Smith's office & which merely related to the form of proceeding.
The impressions, however, made upon my mind from repeated conversations had with my counsel, Majº Clark, were, that Judge Smith had declared, upon being consulted, that I could proceed in Florida as an administrator under letters of administration taken out in Georgia.-
A further impression left upon my mind (though indistinctly) is, that, subsequently to the expression of an adverse opinion in the case, under which opinion the attachment had been dissolved, Maj C.
stated to me that the Judge felt regret at my having been led into error; but that, upon the first presentation of the subject to him, he was of the opinion I could proceed, as at first contemplated by my Counsel, but that the arguments of counsel, & a thorough examination of the matter had produced a change in his view of it, that the opinion he had, at first, expressed was in conformity with the rule prevailing in Connecticut, during the period of his practice in that State.
I have also to state that Mº Macon, from the first, expressed a difference of opinion as to the mode to be adopted by me, but, considering Majº Clark as the Senior Counsel, he gave me notice that he should yield to him the entire management of the case.-
Before closeing this statement it is proper that I should remark, as my impressions are so variant from the affidavit of Majº Clark, that my situation, at the time of receiving them, (being extremely indisposed) may have made me less attentive to the exact meaning of Majº Clark's expressions.—With Majº Clark I have been long in habits of intimacy, & the most perfect mutual confidence has existed between us.-
I have, however, felt it my duty to state every impression upon my mind.—
With Mº Macon I had several conversations, and, a few as I recollect, his impressions from the conversations of Majº Clark, seemed to be similar to my own.—

Copy.
SIR, Agreeable to your instructions, I presented the bond of G. W.
Perpall for $1060 (payable on the 1* August last past and assigned to the United States by Charles Gobert Esq:) to Mº Perpall for payment, and to my disappointment he informed me that it was impossible for him to honour it instantly, not having calculated that it would be dishonoured in New York. The course in this event, to be pursued by me, is, I presume to institute a suit upon the bond immediately, this I shall do, but permit me to suggest that it would be an act of great charity in the Treasury, to allow M* Perpall some further indulgence; this Gentleman manifests every disposition and evinces the most honourable inclination to discharge his obligation, and tenders to the United States ample Security by liens upon real and city property, for the whole debt of $3360, provided he is not coerced at present. The situation of Florida, as it respects its pecuniary state, is more deplorable than you can conceive, there is scarcely an individual in the Territory, that is not oppressed with debt, and the immense number of executions that must be enforced in a few weeks, announce our embarassments and our inability to discharge them. Should Mº Perpall in this case, be carried into Court, and the debt be collected by process of law, I speak within the bounds of reason and upon my reputation, when I state, that I
believe it will take property of the value of four times the debt, to satisfy it. Mº Perpall has other claims upon the Treasury to induce that Department to be somewhat liberal, he has never received any Consideration for the bonds, (now in my hands for collection,) but was induced to sign them by the false representations and earnest solicitations of M* Gobert, (whose character you may be acquainted with,) who was then indebted to the United States and had no prospect of extricating himself but by involving an innocent person, which he has effectually done, and that person now stands accountable for a debt, that was incurred by a generous and benevolent desire to relieve the distresses of an acquaintance. Mº Perpall assures, and from his character, I believe he would scorn to make a false representation or assurance, that should he be indulged he will make every effort to discharge this debt as soon as it could be enforced by law, and I hope and believe that he will be able to do this. Until I hear from you my conduct will be regulated strictly by the law; In your next communication I will be glad to be informed, whether the money

The Judge took some pains to convence me, that I must have misunderstood Mr. Clarke,s remarks, as Mr Clarke never intended to convey the Ideas which had ben impressed upon my mind; but he could not convince me, as I was confident in my views of Mr Clarks meaning
& certain as to his remarks. This conversation took place about 10
Oclock A. M.

SIR, I have this moment received your letter of the 10th inst.

In reply to your Several queries, I have to state that the line of demarcation between the United States and Spain was run under the directions of Commissioners appointed by the respective Governments, M Ellicot on the part of the United States, and Mr Minor *
on the part of Spain, who made a joint report.” The line was run
<pb#543/>
and marked from the termination of the 31 degree of Latitude on the Mississippi to the Chatahoochie, and from thence down to the junction of Flint River, at which point the further progress of the Commissioners was arrested by the appearance of Indian hostilities—The Commissioners thence proceeded to the mouth of the St. Mary's river and ascended that River to the edge of the Okefonoke Swamp, where they erected a monument, and decided that the head of the St.
Mary's river, from which a line should be run to the junction of Flint river should be a point 640 poles in a direction N. E. from the Monument erected by them, provided a line from that point should run at least one mile North of the Monument—I therefore consider this point as established under the treaty, and all that is now to be done is to run a line from such point to the junction of Flint river under the Superintendence of the United States and Georgia The Surveyor of Florida has run a line from the monument erected by the Commissioners at the edge of the Swamp to Flint river to which the Surveys of the Public Lands in Florida have been extended, but the Sales of the Land have been restricted, so as not to extend to such line for the present. The report of the Commissioners will, I

A bill is preparing and which if passed before Congress rises will enable you to commence the surveying of the private claims in Florida as early in the autumn as the climate will admit,” and under the provisions of which I have no doubt that you will execute the whole of the public & private surveys in Florida, at a much earlier period than those in Louisiana will be closed, alth” they have been nearly twenty years in progress.-
At the instance of the members from Georgia there is a bill now before Congress, providing for the running of the boundary line of that State and Florida." I enclose for your information a copy of a letter addressed to the Hon: J: Scott, C. C. on P. Lands, on the subject.”
I observe that the Surveyors of other Land Districts, have limited their contracts within ten complete Townships to each Deputy which I should think as much as one individual ought to have where there is much competition between competent Surveyors, but there are so many considerations bearing on the subject of which the Surveyor himself is the most competent and responsible judge that the amount of the Contract within the capacity of each individual to execute, must be left to his discretion."
With great respect G. G.

I found a ship and Schooner here from New Orleans, which had brought a portion of the stores &c. &c. from that place—Many more are yet to come, and as the vessels of the squadron are all busily employed, I shall direct Lieutenant Rousseau, to charter a vessel to bring those with the officers and men that are at Barrataria. It is the quickest way in which they can be transported, and the expense will not be great.
I shall direct the commanding officer to be careful in evacuating the island, that no injury is done to any private or other property, nor any abuse whatever committed.
The Hornet has just arrived, and is about to have her hold broken out to be cleansed; as she has been sickly since her departure from

An add' mail from Pensacola to either point of junction with the Montgomery & Mobile route, is found to require too great an expense.
The only facility which at present it is found practicable to give to the Correspondence of Pensacola, is to expedite their Eastern intercourse, by transferring the point of departure for the Pensacola mail from Claiborne to Burnt Corn. Orders to that effect are accord-
• Other letters from Warrington written at Pensacola are to be found in the same source as this one. In another letter of April 27, he reported that the water over the bar at Pensacola was sometimes too shallow to admit vessels drawing more than 19 feet. The arrival of Warrington marked the establishment of the Pensacola Navy Yard, which was occupied continuously thereafter until its seizure by the Confederates in Jan. 1861. The yard was burned upon their withdrawal in May, 1862, and practically all the records prior to that date were probably destroyed at that time. Much information relative to the activities of the yard during the territorial period can be derived, however, from the records of the Navy Department.

The policy of the P. O. law requires that Coasting Wessels of every description should deliver their letters into the P. O. but for such as are not required by their circumstances “to report or make entry”
at the Custom house, no means of coercion or punishment are provided.” For them, the inducem" of a Con", by which they will be entitled to recieve 3 cents for each letter so delivered, is thought Sufficient & having made a Con" with one, others will probably follow the example. If you have any S. Boats plying in the waters Coastwise to Pensacola, the Course of their navigation becomes a post route, & is then guarded from indiscriminate transportation by the 19* Sec: of the P. O Law. You will then find it easy to Compel all vessels either to Contract, or to abstain from Conveying letters at all. When ever the law in any of its provisions is violated, it will be y' duty to prosecute, unless the offender acted manifestly without a knowledge of the existence of the law & all intention of offending.
You should endeavour to Contract with the Masters of Coasting Wessels—or to deter them from offending the requisitions of the law.”

<docbody>TO COL” JAMES GADSDEN, SIR, I have received your letter of the 25* March last.” In reply I have the honor to state that no reasons, are known to the Department which make a reexamination of the Country allotted to the emigrant Florida Indians, necessary. My report to the President to which you refer was made upon the clearest evidence of the suffering condition of these people; and the causes referr'd to by me, were such as that condition warranted. It is not reasonable to believe that with a knowledge on the part of the Indians that the Country to which they were destined, would not only, not support them, as it has not, but that they would, in considerable numbers, die upon it, of hunger, that they would have consented to emigrate; or, that, with this knowledge, we, on our part, would have provided it for them, and sent them there. But no intention, I beg you to be assured was entertained to implicate any statements made by you in regard to the opinion you had formed of the fitness of the Country; which I am well satisfied was in strict accordance with the honest convictions of your judgment.
The reports of the Governor of the Territory,” and experience, demonstrate however, that the Indians have not been able to live on the lands allotted to them, and that the numbers who have perished would have been greatly increased, has been made very clear, but for the extension of an extra provision by the Government. The time connected with these circumstances, is esteemed to be favorable for

[Enclosure]
Petition to the Secretary of the Navy from Baltimore Merchants and Underwriters
[May, 1825)
To the Honourable Samuel L Southard Secretary of the Navy of the United States.
The Undersigned Merchants and Underwriters of the City of Baltimore having learned through the medium of the News papers, the intention of the Government to withdraw the Naval Depot and Establishment from Key West, or Thompsons Island and being impressed with the great and increasing importance of that Island to the Commerce of the United States, and expecially to the City of Baltimore, beg leave to draw your attention to the necessity of leaving there some protection for the vessels and Cargoes lying and deposited at that place. They beg leave to state that within a space of less than nine months past, goods to the amount of as they are informed and believe of more than Six hundred thousand Dollars has been landed and stored on the Island, a part of which was shipped from Ports in the United States and a part landed from vessels either wrecked on the Reefs in the neighourhood or retaken from Pirates, of this amount about one hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars was shipped from the Port of Baltimore alone, as will appear from the annexed Schedule. The value and quantity of Merchandise shipped to that place will no doubt continue to increase with the extension of the Commerce of the Country and the value of merchandize landed there from the other Causes mentioned, there is reason to fear will not be lessened. Key West is also of great importance as a place of rendezvous for vessels engaged in the trade to the Gulf of Mexico and the neighbouring West India Islands.
We therefore respectfully request that some efficient protection may be retained upon the Island, when the Naval Establishment is withdrawn, for its defence, in which so large a part of the Commercial Community is interested Dan' Howland Pres" Luke Tiernan & Sons Phoenix Insurance Company L J.

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR Off: Ind: Affairs 4th May 1826.”</place-time>
<docbody>TO THE HON* JOHN COCKE, Chairman of the Committee, of Indian Affairs, House of Representatives, U. S.—
SIR, I have received this morning a letter from George Graham, Esq. Commissioner of the General Land Office,” in which he encloses a copy of the Resolution of the Hon: Mº Winton,” of the 13th U1t” ”
and conveys your request to me, to furnish you with any information I may have relating to the object of the Resolution.
The object of the Resolution is to ascertain what Legislative provision is necessary to secure to the Florida Indians a sufficient quantity of good tillable Land for their support.
I can only state for the information of the Committee, that the original limits assigned to those Indians have been pronounced to be inadequate to their support; and that in pursuance of the provision of the Treaty, Łwe extensions of the Northern line have been ordered, but that unless what is called the big Swamp, (as well as the big Hammock to embrace which those extensions were ordered,) can be taken in and made to form part of those limits, there will not be a sufficient quantity of good tillable land for the support and accommodation of these emigrants. This big swamp, the Indians having settled upon it, and the Executive being anxious to extend to them all the accommodation in his power, has been granted to them for the time being, not as a matter of right, but accommodation. It is believed that lines to be so drawn as to embrace this additional location, will take in enough of good tillable land, but without this big Swamp, it is my opinion the Indians cannot be considered as being provided with a sufficient quantity of good tillable land for their Support. -
If this opinion shall be adopted by the Committee, and reference is respectfully made for its basis, to the Correspondence already sent
<pb#556/>
532 7" E. R. R. I TOR I. A. L.

<source>[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 8 sºl DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Off: Ind: Affairs, 8* May 1826.</source>
TO HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Governor of Florida.
SIR, I have received your several letters by Col" Humphreys,” as has the Secretary of War, that addressed to him.” I am directed by the Secretary to state that no deputations of Indians can be allowed to visit Washington except on the express permission of the Department. The expense is too great, unless a corresponding object existed to justify it—but no such object is percCeived to authorize the present visit. When the authority to which you refer was extended there was an object—but that passed away with the occasion with which it was connected—nor could it be revived short of an occasion equal at least in importance to that. A reference to the letter of permission will show you that it was even then reluctantly given. The Secretary hopes, nevertheless, that the visit may prove favorable by impressing upon these people some proper idea of both our strength and kindness.
They will be treated well. The Title of Governor is unusual, and the Secretary declines confering it on Hicks. He will be distinguished by a Great Medal, and acknowledged the Chief of his people. It is well not to multiply Titles. There is safety in observing old and tried precedents. The head men among Indians, are called Chiefs.
The Indians must be protected on the one hand from the press of White people, of which you speak; and the White people from the depredation of Indians, on the other. The provisions of the intercourse law must form the basis of this mutual protection, and its enforcement is with you, subject to the approval of the Department.
This must be taken as the answer to some other parts of your correspondence in regard to spoliations, and indeed to all except that which relates to old claims both ways, the whites against the Indians, and the Indians against the whites, whether it regards negroes, or any other kind of property.” Upon the subject of those more ancient wrongs, it would be just, and may be considered your duty, especially if the parties request it, for you to collect all the information in regard to the subjects presented by you, within your reach, and report it to the Department for its information and Government.—I would respectfully suggest should you engage in collecting and arranging those cases that you Class them, and be as concise as possible, not only in
<pb#560/>
this business of Classification of complaints and claims, but in your general correspondence. This suggestion is made necessary by the very hard press of duties which require that all details of agencies be settled on the responsibility of the Agents—I mean of course within their legitimate sphere of operations, and that reports and references be studiously brief.
The Secretary approves of your talk to the Indians, in the main, but thinks it proper to guard you as the official organ of the General Government against committing yourself in matters pertaining to the internal affairs, of the Indians. You pledge yourself for example to see to the security of their Chief. The making and unmaking of Chiefs must be left to the Indians themselves, as also all that relates to their own regulations for their own Government. You can and ought to Counsel and advise them for their good, in these matters—
but no more.
In your letter of the 2" March you speak of the Smiths-Shop, and of a list of tools which you say the Agent will show me. These are details that cannot be looked into here, they must be left with the Agent to settle. The provision for the shop is made, and you have been directed to apply it. You know the amount ($1000) and will keep the expenses within it. The appropriatien for this object provides not only for the support of a Gun Smith, but “the expenses incident to the shop,” according to the terms of the Treaty. No addition can be allowed to the 2,000$ authorized to be expended in building an agency House. Nor can any diversion be made of the money appropriated for schools; and as no school has gone into operation, and none in prospect, you will refund what has been remitted on that account. Whatever the feelings of the Indians may be, in regard to the schools for the present, these will change with time and proper instruction, and explanation, and the fund will be meanwhile accumulating. The appropriation cannot be directed to other objects. The arts which you esteem, and justly, to be so important, are taught in the schools, under the Government system, it is part of this system. There is no mistake in the plan of Civilizing the red men. Proofs are numerous in the flourishing condition of many of the Tribes.
No buying or selling of Slaves will be permitted by the Agent, or for the Agency. If the Indians own slaves they are their property;
if they secrete runaway slaves they must give them up, to their rightful owners. If the whites take theirs the law of intercourse must be resorted to. You will explain to the Department the necessity for the use of Six horses and a Wagon, and by what authority they have been purchased.
<pb#561/>
F L O R I, D A 7" E. R. R. I TO R Y 537
I am directed by the Secretary of War explicitly to require prompt quarterly returns. The regulations demand it, and unless these are received, the remittances for the agency cannot be made in future.
I find you are altogether deficient in forms, for your returns.
These I will supply.
It is absolutely indispensable that you keep your contingent apportionment, which is, now fixed at $3000 per annum, and $500 for presents, within these sums.” You will not, of course, exceed the specific appropriations.”—
I have &c. &c.

<place-time>Copy ST. AUGUSTINE 9th May 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I deem it my duty to make Known to you a fact, (for the information of the President of the United States) which I think deeply concerns the government of this Territory. It is this, the business of auctioneer at Key West, since wrecked goods have been carried there and sold to an immense amount has become very profitable. By an Act of the Legislative Council passed at the last Session, the enormous commission of 6 per cent is allowed to Auctioneers in this Territory in all cases.” It is estimated that wrecked property to the amount of nearly half a million of dollars, since the passage of this Act has been taken and sold at auction at Key West; for notwithstanding the repeal of the Territorial wrecking law by Congress,” the wreckers Still carry their Cargoes there, and by what they pretend to be an arbitration the Same abuses are practised as formerly.
from 75 to 80 per cent is often allowed. There is but one auctioneer for the whole Island, and he is George Walton Esq. the Secretary of this Territory, Treasurer, and Acting Governor himself. Col. Walton I believe resides at Tallahassee, but he carries on the business of an auctioneer at Key West, by deputy—that is Richard Fitzpatrick who resides there transacts the business in the name of Col: Walton as his deputy, agent or attorney. Whether Col: Walton holds the
<pb#562/>
commission of Auctioneer from the Governor or not I do not know, but the fact that all wrecked goods carried to that Island are Sold in his name as the Auctioneer, M* Fitzpatrick acting as his deputy, agent or attorney, is unquestionably true. I derive my information from Mº Thomas Murphy, a gentleman of this place of respectability and intelligence, who was at Key West about two months ago and saw advertisements of good's for sale at auction in the above mentioned manner, and a number of persons belonging to this place and who went to Key West several months ago have lately returned sick and in great distress. They all confirm the Statement of M* Murphy and say that it was generally understood and believed at Key West that Col: Walton was the partner of M* Fitzpatrick in the Auctioneers business carried on there.
I do not indeed Know of any express law which forbids the Secretary of this Territory, though holding a high honorable and profitable office by appointment of the President of the United States, from also holding a very profitable office by appointment of the Governor of this Territory, and exercising that office by deputy some five or Six hundred miles from his place of residence. But there appears to me to be a great impropriety in Such an arrangement. My views of the matter may however be erroneous, and I respectfully Submit the above information to the consideration of the President.

<docbody>TO COL” GAD HUMPHREYS Agent, Florida Indians, SIR, I enclose herewith by direction of the Secretary of War his answer to the request made by the Delegation in regard to an extension of their limits—and which contains also some Counsel and reproof, all which you will have faithfully interpreted to them, and return their answer to the Department.
There are several references made to you, as Agent, and to the duties which, it is to be presumed the Superintendent will cause to devolve on you. See to their execution. As to the School, you can see the Rev" Doctor Milledollar in New York, or Jeremiah Everets, Esq. of Boston, and state the provision in the Treaty for a school.
They will know what to do, if they engage in the work.
The business of the Delegation being done, you will so soon as

and be permitted to visit your family according to Governor Duval's leave to that effect.”
I now call your attention to your accounts. There is a Bill of yours on my Desk now for 375 Dollars, which cannot be paid until the state of your account is reported by the proper accounting officer of the Treasury.

[Enclosure]
The Secretary of War to Delegation of Florida Indians “
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 10* May 1826.
TO THE DELEGATION OF FLORIDA INDIANS, FRIENDS & BROTHERS, I have considered your request to have your boundary line extended, and made it known to your Great Father, the President. I am directed to answer, that he gives his consent for you to occupy the Big Swamp until he may have a call for it, when he will expect you to move within the limits of the survey. He sent you this message by Governor Duval.
Your Great Father does not wish to oppress his Red Children.
He has heard of your sufferings, and sent you some help. But he wishes me to inform you, that you have had time to plant and gather your crops, that you must rely for the future, on yourselves, and by your industry provide for your own support.
Brothers—Your Great Father has heard that you have runaway Slaves in your Country, and that many of your people hide them from their owners. The Treaty provides that you should give them
<pb#564/>
up. It is expected that you will do this; and that you will hereafter so soon as a Slave runs into your Country, take him up and deliver him to the Agent for his rightful owner. It is said that the whites have some of your Slaves. The agent is directed to see justice done you, and wherever he finds your slaves in possession of the whites to demand their surrender.
Brothers.-Now that you are settled in your new homes, I have to call your attention to a few things. Your young men are not always good. They go into the settlements and steal, and kill stock, and alarm the whites, and the Women and Children. This must not be.
You will therefore give orders to your young men to keep within your limits, and if they will not obey you, you must punish them. If you do not, Your Great Father will order his agent to let a heavy hand fall upon you. If the whites trespass upon you, do not strike—but go to the agent—he is directed to protect you. You must listen to these directions. Your Great Father will be kind to you, if you obey his Counsel—but if you do not, you will be punished.
Brothers—Your Great Father expects you to live in peace with one another, to be industrious and sober. Drunkenness is a curse, and no Indian ought ever to get drunk. It makes him a beast—
and brings him into trouble. Let alone the mad water, and be sober.
Brothers.-The Treaty provides a thousand Dollars for the support of a School at the Agency. This is intended to benefit your Children.
It is time it was in operation. It is there your Children will learn to read, and write, and keep accounts; and how to make ploughs, and wheels, and looms and how to use them, and all other things useful to you. Your Great Father expects you to encourage these improvements in your Children. The agent is directed to seek for a Teacher, and when one goes out, he will go under the protection of your Great Father.
Brothers—I explained to you that I did not expect you could live so well where you are, as on lands where the game is plenty and water good and abundant. Your Great Father owns a great Country over the Mississippi, and is willing to give you a large portion of it, whenever you may incline to go. And, if a few of your Chiefs think proper to visit it and bring you back word what sort of Country it is, they can go, and the agent will be directed to send them, and pay their expenses. It is expected that some of your friends of the Muskhogues Tribe will go and look at that Country—Your Chiefs might go at the same time.
This advice is for your good—and is given to you in friendship.
I hope you will follow it.
Brothers—I once more tell you, your Great Father will protect you, through the agent, from the bad conduct of the whites, and he will
<pb#565/>
F L OR I D A T E R P I TO AP Y 541
severely punish you if you do not prevent your bad men from going into the settlements and doing harm to the whites. This you must not forget. If you will take the property of the whites the value of it will be taken from your annuity. The agent is ordered to do so.
Brothers—I shake hands with you, and wish you, prosperity and happiness.”—
JAMES BARBOUR.

John Rodman to Benjamin K. Pierce Sº AUGUSTINE 11th May 1826.
SIR, In answer to your request, that I would furnish you with such information, as I possessed, in regard to the public road, between this City and Tallahassee, lately laid out and constructed by Mº Bellamy, under a contract made with Capt. Burch, of the Army of the United States, acting on behalf of the United States, I have the honour to State, that I have no personal knowledge of the condition of this road, nor how far Mº Bellamy has fulfilled his contract, having never myself been on the road, nor seen the contract in question. All that I know of this road is derived from the information of others, some of whom had travelled for a considerable distance on it, and others reported to me the general opinion of travellers. Mr Streeter, the Sheriff of this County, and post master in this City, mentioned to me, some time ago, that the road was very badly made. Mr John Robinson of New York, made a visit to Tallahassee, from this place, about a month ago, and travelled, as he informed me, about a hundred miles on the road. He stated to me, on his return from Tallahassee, that the road was made in a very slight and insecure manner; and the stumps of the trees left standing to a considerable height on the road. Lieut.
Cooper of the army of the U. S., visited Tallahassee, soon after
<pb#568/>
544 7" EP R N 7" O R / A L PA P E R S Mr Robinson returned from that place, and confirmed, to the utmost extent, the statement which Mº Robinson had previously given of the condition of this road. I did not myself converse with M*
Cooper on the subject, but was informed by Lieut. Brown, of what he had reported. M' Gould, the editor of the newspaper printed here also informed me, that all travellers agreed in opinion that the road was very badly made, and by no means conformably to the proposals for the contract published by Capt. Burch.
I understand also, that Mr Waters Smith, the U. S Marshal for this district, Mr Streeter the Sheriff, and Mº Reynolds, the Mayor of this City, and Lieut Brown have all recently been on a part of the road, between this City and the S" John's river, and that it is their unanimous opinion that the road is very badly made.
With regard to depositions to substantiate these facts, I do not believe that I can conveniently procure them. Both M. Robinson and Lieut. Cooper, who gave information respecting the road beyond the St John's river, have left this City. Besides, permit me to observe, that depositions do not appear to me to be the best mode of ascertaining the true condition of this road. Contradictory depositions may probably be given by the friends of the Contractor. The best, and indeed, in my opinion, the only sure mode to obtain correct information on the subject, would be to send an officer of the Army to examine the road, all the way to Tallahassee. On his return he would be able to make a report that might be depended upon.”
With much respect, I have the honour to be Sir, Your obt. Servant JOHN RODMAN

SIR, In compliance with your request, in answering your enquiries, relative to the public road between Sº Johns, & the Ockolockeney Rivers, I shall describe briefly, to the best of my recollection, the state of said road, over which I travelled, in the month of March last.
About nine miles from the River Sº Johns, I entered on the road alluded to, & continued my journey thereon about Twenty miles—
The road, to the best of my judgment, is not more than Sixteen feet wide, and although, I am not much conversant with roads, yet, I am
<pb#569/>
F L OR I D A 7" E R P I TO R Y 545
inclined to think, that the distance of Sixteen feet, is too narrow for the ordinary purposes of travelling, in this part of Florida:-On the part of the road on which I have travelled, many places are low, and in rainy weather usually overflow'd and necessarily require to have causeways to make them passable.—I have observed only one causeway, which appeared to me to be roughly done, & imperfect; and according to my opinion, the road in other places, required causeways, & bridges, to make it suitable for travelling—
The Stumps were generally too high, to make travelling convenient for Carriages, Waggons &c, and on the whole, the Road, as far as I had an opportunity of observing it, did not appear to me, to be constructed, in conformity to the Terms which I had seen in the Proposals published in the East Florida Herald of the 4* January 1825–
This simple statement of the part of the Road over which I
travelled, is submitted according to your request, not with a view of impugning the diligence, & correctness of M* Bellamy, who no doubt, had many difficulties to contend with, but of giving a candid description, without reference to the parties concerned in any way whatsoeVer—

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE 17 May 1826</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I understand that an appropriation of 20,000 dollars has been sanctioned by Congress for the relief of the Florida Indians “–
As their supposed starving condition has been ascribed to the treaty concluded with them nearly 3 years since, and has given rise to some very unjust reflections on the Commissioners who negotiated that compact, I feel authorised to address you once more on this Subject that any future distress among the Refugees may be ascribed to the true cause, and not to Individuals who have had no agency in producing them—
The provisioning the Emigrant Indians was one of the stipulations in the treaty, and the liberality of that article, I am inclined to think, contributed in some degree to the distress now complained of, for it is a singular fact, that that portion of the nation who were considered as
<pb#570/>
546 7" E R F I TO R. I. A. L. PA P E R S excluded from its provisions, are now in a condition greatly superior to those who have been bountifully fed the previous year—The provisioning the Indians for one year was intended to assist & facilitate, not prevent their immediate location, and the issues should have been controlled not by numbers solely but by settlements, and actual location with improvement of the soil should have been received as evidence of their title to the bounty extended—In this way the issues would have operated as a stimulant to the cultivation of the earth, and the Indian would have early discovered that being fed one year was not intended to produce a starving condition the next—The plan adopted was however on principles somewhat the reverse—Camps were in some instances permitted to be formed in the neighbourhood of Depots, provisions were consumed as if there was to be no termination to the issues, and all exertions were suspended on the part of the Indians even to the neglect of the hunting season, as if the Governmental bounty of the present was to last through succeeding years—I
do not say that this was general; The most deserving Chiefs with their followers had more foresight and early commenced those agricultural establishments which were necessary for their future subsistence and comfort—But the Refugee party, who merit neither the sympathy or bounty of the General Government acted quite the reverse and those are the men who are now reported to be suffering, and who will continue in a suffering condition, as an apology for their depredations, the moment the governmental bounty is suspended.
In thus adverting to the mode adopted in issuing provisions to the Indians under the stipulations to that effect in the treaty, I would wish to be understood as speculating solely on its supposed effects, and not as distantly reflecting on the agents who were governed by what had been the invariable practise elsewhere—A different plan however, limited as will be suggested in this communication, is calculated in my opinion to produce the results contemplated, and the relief extended to the Suffering Indians may be made by judicious management the means of concentrating locating, and acquiring a control over them *—
It is not the incapacity of the country to Sustain the Indians which has produced the condition to which a portion of them are reduced, or which has impelled them to the acts of depredation complained of; but the same restless, lawless spirit which has hurried them into all the irregularities of which for years they have been guilty and to which there will be no termination without the exercise of some authority on the part of the General Government with a view to the introduction
<pb#571/>
of wholesome discipline among them—Though late with the means again at command, it is not an unpropitious moment to act with effect, and the interest which in common with the citizens of this territory I feel on this subject will be my apology for again suggesting to your consideration, that simultaneous with the recommencement of the issues of provisions there should be established a military post on the northern limit of the Indian Country; That the issues of provisions under the control of the agent should be within the country allotted the Indians and confined to those who actually commence improvements and are unremitted in their efforts towards raising the necessary supplies for their subsistence the succeeding years—That all those who will not concentrate within the boundaries marked, or who may be found beyond them after a certain period should be considered as Outlaws to be delt with according to instructions from the President of the U S or as any territorial law may direct—The effect of such a policy rigidly enforced will at once draw the line of distinction between those Indians who merit protection and those who merely hang upon the advanced settlements to depredate and plunder—These under the enforcement of a necessary discipline will either return to the Creek nation from whence they absconded, or quit the territory for some other country more congenial to their habits—They are a band of restless savages who have infested our Southern border ever since the termination of the Creek war of 1813—Wandering Ishmalites their hands are, and will continue to be raised against every people who will not assume the authority they have power to exercise, and subdue repress by compulsion irregularities which moderation cannot check *—

<source>[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Seminole: C *</source>
<place-time>[May 17, 1826)</place-time>
Talk of the Florida Delegation of Indians delivered by Tuckasee Mothla, the Head Chief, in reply to one from the Hon" James Barbour Secretary of War, Brother We have heard the talk you sent us by our Agent—You say our Great Father gives us permission to occupy the land we ask for (the Big Swamp ") until he may want to send us from it—
This does not please us—The land we occupy, we expect will be considered our own property, to remain as such for ever, unless we may think proper to part with it—If this is refused us, we can not be happy, for we do not like the thoughts of being put to the trouble of moving again—The hardship we suffered from our first removal, gave us pain enough—We do not wish to feel it again, and we have such confidence in the justice of the our Great Father, that we do not believe he will force it upon us, but will comply with our demands and give us more land—This was promised us by the Treaty of Sº Augustine—We only ask that this promise should be complied with—It is necessary to make us comfortable—The tract of land embraced in the present limits of our Territory ef Hahd, is small & very poor—We cannot live on it—
Many have been obliged to Settle in the Big Swamp where some good land has been found—Give that to us also-We shall then be able to make bread for our wives & children and shall be satisfied—When we left the good land about Tallahassee and Mickasuky which is now covered by the White Skins, we stopped at the Big Swamp because we knew we could not live further South, and because we were to hold by Governor Duval, that we might do so; and that we should have the land—We now claim the fulfillment of his promise, and of that in the Treaty.—We were often deceived by the Spaniards—They made promises which they never kept—But we were told, “the Americans are a straight people—We believed it—We hope we shall never have cause to change our minds.-
You say our Great Father, sent help to our people, who have been hungry because they could make no corn last year—We feel thankful for this and will not forget it.—
You tell us at the same time, that our Great Father says we must in future rely upon ourselves & by our industry, provide for our own
<pb#573/>
F. L. O. R. I D A T E R F I TO R Y 549
support—We do not complain of this, but we expect he will not deny us such lands as will enable us to do so—You Say too, our Great father does not wish to oppress his red children—We believe it and that he will keep the treaty & give us more land.—We ask that the north line of our territory may be removed so as to embrace a small swamp called Wectooxy.—This will enable us to live and make us contented.—
Brother, you tell us that our Great Father owns a great country over the Big River towards the setting sun and that he is willing to give us a part of it if we will go there and he advises us to send some of our chiefs with the Muscogees when they go, to look at it, and bring us back word what sort of Country it is—We have already said we do not intend to move again—If the Muscogees have a disposition to go further towards the setting sun, we are perfectly willing they should go; but we will not go with them—We have no friends there, the people of that country are strangers to us—The Muscogees invited us to go with them, but it was only to make their party stronger—We will not involve ourselves in the troubles of the Muscogees—We are a separate people and have nothing to do with them—
We came brother not to see the Muscogees, but to hold a talk with our Great father on our own affairs and to claim of him more land in our own Country—Most of us were born on the land we now inhabit &
that which we claim to be surrendered to us.-here our navel strings were first cut & the blood from them, sunk into the earth, & made the country dear to us.-We have heard that the Spaniards sold this Country to the Americans—This they had no right to do, the land was not theirs, but belonged to the Seminoles—Brother, we have come here, where we should find Spanish, English, French and Americans; to talk with our Great Father about this matter & have it put right—We have not yet seen our Great Father, We have come many days travel to see him and do not wish to return without shaking hands with him—
You tell us brother, that our Great Father has heard that we have runaway Slaves in our Country and that many of our people hide them from their owners—It is true that some slaves who run away from the whites have come into our Country—Most of them however were given up, before we left home:—we think that by this time, the rest of them are with their owners—We left orders with some of our chiefs to have them taken and brought to the agency We do not like the story that our people hide the runaway negroes from their masters It is not a true talk—Our people have not done this—We do not consider ourselves bound by the Treaty, to take up any runaway slaves, but those who have entered our country since the making of
<pb#574/>
the Treaty—But we have never prevented the whites from coming into our country and taking their slaves wherever they could find them & we will not hereafter oppose their doing so, but will give them all the assistance we can.—
Brother, We are glad to hear that our negroes held by the whites, are to be claimed for us. This is right, and we hope that our Great Father will put it in the power of our Agent to see justice done us in this matter—We do not know if the white people will mind his talks when he demands our property, for they are not always willing to do right when they can avoid it—The laws of our nation are strong &
oblige a man having the property of another in his possession, to give it up to the right owner.—The laws of the whites, who have so much better sense than the red men, ought not to be less powerful and just—
Brother—You say that some of our young men are not always good and that they go among the whites and kill their stock—A few of them we know have done this and we have punished them for it, and we have lately made such laws as we think will prevent their going so any more—It is not our wish to disturb our white neighbours but to live in friendship with them.
Brother—You tell us that our Great Father wishes to place a school in our nation to teach our children to read & write—We do not wish one at all—We do not believe the great Spirit intended we should know how to read & write; for if he had intended this, he would have given us the knowledge as early as he gave it to the white people—
Now it is too late; the white people have gained an advantage, we can never recover and it is better for us to remain as we are, red men &
live in our own way.—Brother, among our people it is thought that at the time when there were but two kinds of people, the red and the white, on the earth, a book was placed by the Great Spirit in the hands of an old man, blind, and with a long beard, who told the red and the white man, that he who killed the first Deer, should receive the book as his reward & be learnt to read it—Both went out to hunt different ways—The white man after going a little way, found a sheep, which being not so wild as the Deer, he easily Killed—
He took this sheep to the blind man & told him it was a Deer—
The old man believed him and gave him the book and learnt him how to read it—The red man soon after brought in a deer, but he was too late—the white man had got the book—If this cheat had not been practised, the red man would have been now as the white man is &
he as the red man—
Brother—If the Great Sprit had intended that the red men should know how to read, he would not have allowed the white man to take this advantage of us.
<pb#575/>
Brother—The business we have come here upon, is very important to our nation—We wish to have it settled soon that we may return to our homes & make the hearts our people glad by telling them what we have done Brother, We send you this talk & take the hand you offer us & will hold it “till we get your answer *

<place-time>ST: AUGUSTINE, May 18* 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to report my arrival at this place last evening, having travelled hither with a view to the Inspection of the Road opened under Mº Bellamy's contracts made with me as Agent for the United States, the time being about to expire when they were required to have been completed. Major Pierce handed me this morning your letter of the 21* April last in relation to certain complaints made by Mº Rodman respecting the Road,” also a copy of his letter making the complaint. If public Rumour is to govern respecting the fulfilment of these contracts, as much perhaps would be said in its favor as against it according as different persons might view it, & according to the seasons, whether wet or dry; in fact it is rare that any two persons perhaps should be found who would agree in opinion, so various are those which I have myself heard expressed, respecting the most proper mode of construction for a Road. But any complaint or discussion of this kind was, & is, wholly unnecessary, for I have myself decided that the Road under neither of the contracts made with M* Bellamy is completed according to the letter of the contract of course neither has been received. That from
<pb#576/>
552 7' E. R. R. I TO R. I. A. L. PA P E R S the Ocholochonee to St: Johns is not yet entirely completed as he had himself intended it for offering to inspection, & his hands are still at work on it. That from St: John's to this City he considers as being completed. I have examined it and in my opinion, all that could be required under the contract has been done, with some exceptions of but little consequence, considered as to the labor which it would require to complete it. The contract states that in any difference between the Contractor & myself, an umpire shall be chosen by us jointly, to decide such question. This however I have not done, preferring, in consequence of your letter to Major Pierce to await further instructions from you, under the belief it is quite possible that it is your intention to appoint a Commissioner to inspect and receive the Road independent of myself; and in that case any thing now done by me would be a dead letter. Although between this and the St: John's some work remains undone which In my opinion ought to have been done, yet much more has been done in other places than the contract, or even practical use viewing it in connection with what was to be the general mode of constructing the Road, required. The land between this place & the St. Johns is low pine barren, a great portion of which is covered with water in rainy seasons, but it is firm hard sand with scarcely a rod of miry & marshy ground.
Such places however in this low land as were particularly low & wet have been to a very considerable extent ditched & thrown up; and is now that the country is dry, a fine loose sand, not as convenient to travel over as if it had been left in its natural state, yet the throwing it up will be in future of very great service to the Road. There is also much of the low lands of the same description west of the St:
Johns River that have been thrown up. I have all along been perfectly aware in my different examinations of the Road that the contract had not been strictly complied with, but I was anxious to have it opened through as speedily as possible & placed in travelling order, & therefore forbore to direct such portions of it to be altered or improved until the whole should be recommenced; the contractor having always expressed the utmost willingness to comply with any of my Requisitions hereafter. Accordingly the Road is now opened to this place, & is in as good travelling order as any rough unbroken Road constructed through a wilderness can be—
I knew that much had been said about the Road, & the more, because many persons expected it to be a turnpike, & in consequence of that, also of my own situation in regard to M* Bellamy's family, I

stood that there is any material deficiencies nor such as could not be easily remedied, but sufficient only to prevent its being accepted in its present state."—
The time for the completion of the first of these contracts expired on the 31* December last, & the second expires on the 30” June next;
but the first having been extended by me, (if my act in that respect is approved, of which I am not advised,) both expire on the latter date; & the bonds will be forfeited to the Government if it is thought proper to exercise such power, in case the Road should not be then received. The primary reason why these Roads were not finished long since arose from the unusually wet seasons since the contracts were entered into. In fact to such an extent has the water, to my own personal knowledge, covered the low grounds & filled the ponds on this Route, that it was impracticable to causeway & construct the Road properly until in the present spring since the first of March last.
If I had had the troops on many parts of this section of Road, I should unquestionably have abandoned the work until a dry season could have enabled me to work to advantage.—
In reference to my instructions touching this Road it is possible I
may have been mistaken too as to the meaning." They required that all the Streams should be bridged & the miry, marshy, ground causewayed. Many seem to be of opinion that all the low, sandy, pine lands either were to have been, or at least ought to be thrown up. If that was the intention, I have mistaken the meaning of the order, &
have erred both in explaining what was required to be done to such low grounds under the advertisements & when forming the contracts.
# that was the ###ehtień ſ have histakeh–If the Road was really to have been turnpiked, it would cost at least $200,000 to make the Road from this place to Tallahassee, so much of that description of land is to be found on the Route. on this subject I request you will please to inform me. My own impressions certainly were, that a good practicable Road, which could be passed at all seasons, wet or dry, with carriages, was all that was intended either by your instructions or the Act of Congress. That system I have endeavored to adhere to in its construction. It surely cannot be expected that any Road should be entirely exempt from the casualties of freshets or hurricanes, even the most permanently constructed turnpikes require constant repairs to preserve them from being broken into Ravines, of course the causeways on this Road must be subject to being swept away; though so far, not one was swept off or injured, although not fully completed & secured, in the very heavy Rains of the last winter.—
<pb#578/>
I have now but one favor to ask of you in relation to these contracts;-That some other person may be forthwith appointed to act in my stead in examing & receiving the Road.” And when such inspection is made I shall of course accompany the Commissioner on the Road. I request you will please to reply to this letter as soon as convenient as I think it important both to myself & the Contractor that a decision should be speedily had; and if a Commissioner is to be appointed I will thank you to inform me who he is. I am of opinion that the inspection should commence at Tallahassee.—
I shall leave here tomorrow for Tallahassee where I shall remain until I receive your letter, (if no duty requires my immediate return to Pensacola,) which I request may be forwarded in duplicate, one to Tallahassee & one to Pensacola. I am myself desirous to remain in that Section of Country until this Road is completed & the business settled.—
I shall from Tallahassee write again on the subject of the width of the Road which I think it unnecessary to increase to the full twenty five feet for any practical purpose; though I should prefer having it done for appearance sake, in case I can command the services of the Troops at Pensacola, & there is money for the purpose.*—

It is deemed however, important that in fixing the limits, that suitable, and well defined lines be first specified, as well to avoid difficulties in regard to what are the true limits, as to govern the operations of the intercourse Law. You will therefore report such designations as shall embrace this Big Swamp, provided it shall be necessary to include it all: If not, such portion of it as may be essential to give these people a sufficiency of good tillable land.”—

however believe he has never examined the County, his information is the same as mine, I immagine; obtained from the Citizens, their statements vary very much, and their knowledge of the County appears to me to be very limited, never haveing traveled through:
except on the old trail leading to S' Marys. this they describe as being a very low swampy County, which will require causewaying, and the ground thrown up for several miles, it will be therefore necessary for me to examine the Country well before I can determine and mark out the route, this Cannot well be done before the rainy season is over, which is generally about the Middle of September, any attempt at present would be useless should the rains continue as they have for the two last seasons, this will cause no delay in opening the road, for the Troops cannot Commence the labour before the first of October, I think then if the seasons should prove favourable, the road may be compleated by the last of December.
I have fully assertained that no supplies can be obtained in that Country, except a little Corn, and that is very doubtfull, as their Crops at present look miserable.
As the Supplies both for the Troops, forage for the Teams, tools baggage &c. must be transported one hundred and thirty miles, before the work Commences, and then to Continue on as they progress, it will require at least Eight good substantial Mule Teams, four Mules each, besides two or three extra Mules to carry water to to the working parties, these Teams, with Waggons, Harness, forage &c. must be transported from Pensacola, I shall immediately make my requisitions on Capt Burch that he may have time to procure the supplies and transport them to this place by the 15* of September.
Could a portion of the supplies be furnished from Charleston and transported up the Sº Johns to Picolati, the point where the road from Pensacola crosses for Augustine, the land carriage from that, to where this road will intersect, I believe will not be more than thirty five or forty miles, and probably part of the Supplies may be taken up black Creek to the ferry in barges, I have not been able as yet to obtain any Correct information on that Subject. the report of the Citizens vary on that point, I have found that the only means of acquireing a Correct knowledge of the Country streams &C. is to make a personal examination.
be assured Sir, I shall exert myself to acquire a knowledge of the Country. to obtain the Supplies, and faciliate the opening the road in the shortest possible time.
I am happy to say that Col” Brooke is disposed to give every facility in his power to compleating the work.”

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY JOHN W. SIMONTON</dochead>
<source>[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 2 sess.:Pr]</source>
<place-time>[May 28, 1826)</place-time>
<docbody>To the Members of Both Houses of Congress.
The establishing of a Court at the island of Key West, is founded on a necessity so strong, that little need be said to prove its propriety.
The Senate have thought proper to sanction a bill for that purpose; *
it is presumed the reasons which induced it, when properly presented, will claim an equal force before the House of Representatives, to whom the bill from the Senate has been referred.*
The population of the island is at present nothing short of three hundred souls, while the county of Monroe, of which this Key is
<pb#585/>
F L O Fe I D A 7' E. R. R. I TO Hº Y 561
the Capital, amounts to seven hundred, which is daily and rapidly increasing. It must hence result, as matter of course, that differences and disputes of a civil, and charges too of a criminal nature, must occasionally arise, requiring the interposition of the Judiciary.
Protection and allegiance are reciprocal terms. It is a principle for which the United States have always contended, and which, even in their colonial state, they boldly asserted. But when it is borne in mind that the population of this island, being citizens of the States, are at a distance of four hundred miles from Pensacola, which is the nearest point to which a judicial reference can be had, the trouble, expense, and difficulty, to which they must and will be subjected, must at once be obvious. If a civil suit shall arise, thither, or to St. Augustine, which is a hundred miles more distant, must the parties proceed, to obtain a decision of the difference; while, should it be a criminal matter, the accused, contrary to that lenity and indulgence which other citizens of the United States are possessed of, must necessarily be carried to a distance from his friends and home, put upon his trial, remotely from the point where his witnesses are; and, if a poor and humble man, be greatly without the means of enforcing their attendance. The affluent and the wealthy are never without the means of sustaining and defending themselves, and derive other facilities than those which the law itself extends. Legal interposition in their behalf is perhaps not a matter of such great necessity, although it is still right and proper, that even for them, proper tribunals should by the government be established. But with the man who is without property and without friends, whose life and liberty alike deserve to claim protection from his country, the thing is different. Charge him with an offence, and without a court to hear him, he must be seized and carried to Pensacola or St. Augustine for trial, where to be confronted with witnesses will be difficult, and where the appearance of his own for the purpose of defence and acquittal, will be rendered by the distance impracticable, if not impossible.
Difficulty of prosecution will exist on the one side, while on the other the means of defence will be procured at great expense, and at still greater hazard.
Considered in this point of view only, it would seem, that enough is urged to induce a belief, that the measure proposed is correct and right. A reference to our former history will show, that in our list of grievances, pressed against the mother country, was the sending our citizens abroad for trial; and certainly it was strongly urged.
It was decried as a grievous and heavy imposition, and one altogether contrary to the rights of the governed. But in what consisted the difference, in the cases then complained of, and in the present?
To be sure, the distance was greater from America to England, than
<pb#586/>
from Key West to the United States. Yet in the principle there was no difference. In both there is perfect identity. The complaints then urged was the inconvenience to which the accused was subjected, the increased hazard necessarily to be met,_the injury done to the unoffending, in forcing them to appear as witnesses on the prosecution, and the unavoidable consequent and increased dangers to which the accused was exposed by being dragged to a distance from his home and friends, where character might aid him, and from witnesses whose attendance might not be in his power to procure.
The Government of the United States, it is respectfully conceived, ought not, in cases of such strong resemblance, so soon to forget the strenuousness with which the right now asked for was by them so fearlessly urged and maintained. Were the citizens of Key West within any reasonable distance of a court, where judicial investigation could be had, the cases would be different; but, surely it cannot be considered other than a grievance, when it is apparent that no remedy is presented, short of proceeding 4 or 500 miles to obtain it, at great cost, and at an imminent risk both to life and liberty.
Nor are the people of the Island alone interested in this business.
The frequent wrecks which take place along the reef of Florida, makes it matter of interest to the citizens of our commercial towns, who of course are in want of some tribunal competent and independent, which, in reference to all the circumstances, may decide upon the amount of salvage, properly chargeable on the various shipwrecks that take place. The property when abandoned must in some way or other be disposed of. The wrecker, with a view to his own interest, will carry it to that point, where least hazard from the dangers of the sea will be encountered, and where on its arrival it may most speedily be decided on. Heretofore, for the want of a court, the parties interested have consented to refer the matter to arbitration, and thereby to have the salvage ascertained; this most certainly they had not merely the power, but the right to do. If, as is alleged to be the case, higher rates of allowance have been made, than was required by the risks and labor encountered in rescuing the property, it only proves the necessity of creating a tribunal clothed with Government sanction, that thereby such errors may for the future be prevented or avoided.
Previous to the treaty which ceded Florida, persons engaged in wrecking were in the habit of carrying property thus obtained to New-Providence or to Cuba. They were points which could most easily be reached—at less expense, and at less hazard; and, of course, were resorted to, in preference to those which were more distant.
The consequence was, that the revenue of the United States was thereby impaired. To prevent this, Congress early after the cession
<pb#587/>
of Florida, passed a law, requiring that all wrecked property should be brought to the United States, and denouncing against those who should attempt to carry it beyond our limits, severe forfeitures.
The provisions of this law, were doubtless more readily complied with, for the reason that the port of Key West, being contiguous to the point where the wrecks took place, induced no great advantage in taking the cargoes there; but let Congress, by any embarrassment thrown in the way, impose the necessity of their proceeding to a more distant port, or to one where an adjudication cannot readily be had, and forthwith, will all the property found there be carried to ports beyond the limits of the United States, to New Providence or Cuba, to the injury of the revenue, and certainly not to the benefit of the owners. To prevent this, laws may be passed; but to enforce and render them effectual, will require all the energies of the Government. Over and above this, by a transfer of the cargoes to Nassau an additional injury will be sustained to the commercial interest, by diverting the Spanish trade entirely from this section of the country.
Capitalists and capital will always go where profit is to be found, a law established then, which shall recognise Key West as the point of resort for the various wrecks that take place along that coast, will So attract public attention, as that property will always bring its fair and proper value; and thus every thing of suspected injustice to owners be avoided. Already considerable capital is centered on the island, in addition to which, merchants from Havana, only about nine hours sail, will, as they have usually done, resort there when sales are about to take place.
In a single year, from December 1824 to December 1825, $293,353 00, of wrecked property; was sold there and never but in one instance did it fail to bring nearly its value, some of it going even beyond its value. Since December, the amount has greatly exceeded the proportion of the previous year, nor has the sales been of less value to the owners.-During this time, or rather since October, 1824, the duties accruing to the Government at Key West, as I have been informed, have exceeded $100,000 00, * most of which would have been lost to the United States, if by any embarrassments thrown in the way, the wrecks had been carried to Nassau; and this indeed would have been the case, if, under the provisions of our law, the wreckers had been required to proceed to any remote or inconvenient post.
The case alluded to, where the property did not bring its full value, is that of the brig Hercules, Capt. Seaman, of New York. Of this I speak with confidence, having been at the Island at the time this cargo was sold. Respecting this brig, incorrect representations have
<pb#588/>
564 T E R P I TO R. I. A. L. PA P E R S been made. She had been wrecked and her cargo brought something less than $100,000. Insurance had been made upon her cargo for
$208,000. It does not however follow, that it was in fact worth that sum. Be that as it may, owing to the circumstance of her having heeled and received a considerable quantity of water into her hold, some of the most valuable goods on board were materially damaged.
Upon this vessel it is alleged, $72,500 was paid for salvage; this is not true. The amount received by the wreckers was $25,800 or thereabouts. Thus, instead of $72,500 as has been represented, a much less sum was paid, making a difference between the amount imputed, and that actually paid, of $46,700.
Shortly after the sale Mr. John Searle, agent of the under-writers, arrived at the Island, and proposed to pay $72,500 to have returned to him the vessel and cargo as it was when wrecked. P. C. Greene &
Co. acceded to the proposal, and set about to re-purchase the goods, although they were in the hands of various purchasers, and actually paid 40 to 50 per cent. advance, in some cases, to obtain them. Some of them, however, could not be procured, and for this deficiency a deduction proportional to the sum first offered was made, and the contract was thus concluded. It is from this eircumstance that the imputation has obtained currency that $72,500 was allowed for salvage, when, in fact, and in truth, it was the result of arrangement, and compromise.
One objection to the establishment of a court, is found in letters insidiously pressed upon Members of Congress from St. Augustine.
Who, let me ask, are the persons who urge these objections? Have the people met and presented any memorial? Have the merchants there, who understand the nature and force of business, come forward.
Not at all. It proceeds altogether from one, two, or three emigrant lawyers, who have gone to Florida in quest of better prospects than they could find in a fair competition of talents in the States where they resided. They have discovered, forsooth, that the island is sickly, that designing men live there, and that the commercial interest of the country materially demands a change of places for the sale of wrecked property—and that place is ST. AUGUSTINE.-Now is it not obvious to every one who will reflect for a moment, that interested and selfish considerations alone, must influence the writers of those letters? Bring, if it were possible, the wrecked property to that place, and of course the lawyers, by their libels and suits, must and will be benefited: and hence is found the cause of their deep solicitude—
their great exertions for the public good.
In some respects I am connected with the firm of P. C. GREENE &
Co. It is a mercantile house established upon capital, and is in good credit. The island is partly owned by the firm, who, with a view to
<pb#589/>
add to its prosperity, have given, rather than sold, lots in the town, with a view to its improvement. This firm, to be sure, having an interest, may be benefited by whatever shall conduce to the interest of the island. Their's however, is an open, not occult interest. They may be employed as Commission merchants, as has already been the case. They may purchase wrecked property, and in doing so will enter into a fair competition with the rest of the world. Beyond these, they have no interest, and whatever of imputation or suspicion, upon an interest thus declared may be circulated to their prejudice, is presumed to be met and over ruled by the substantial reasons which are here urged in behalf of the proposed measure. The interest of the commercial part of the community—justice to the wreckers, who venture their lives and property—and above all, protection on the part of the Government to the inhabitants of the Island, demand loudly the adoption of the measure that is asked for by the bill enacted by the Senate.”

Co! THOMAS L M*KENNEY Gen.' Superintendant of Indian Affairs SIR Your letter of the 8” Inst is received.” I regret sincerely that the Secretary is dissatisfied with the liberty I took, in sending to the City a deputation of the Chiefs with the Agent. I Acted under the belief that I was empowered to do so, and that the object in view (the removal of the Indians West of the Mississippi) was of sufficient importance to authorise the deputation: In future no deputation shall go to Washington without express permission from the Secretary nor shall any talk which I may deliver to the Indians Commit the Government.
I Confess it is a subject of mortification to me after exerting myself faithfully to accomplish the views of the department, to find I have failed to do so, in any instance. The advice And instructions Contained in your letter will be strictly attended to.
All the Supplies for the Indian Department are procured at New Orleans, the distance is Considerable, and the Communication by

If then the quarterly Accounts are delayed longer than usual, it is Owing to the difficulty of obtaining transportation And the necessary supplies for the Indians at Tampa Bay regularly and in due time unless at an expence which the Secretary would not approve. On my part the returns shall not be delayed.”
I have no recollection that I ever have exceeded in any instance, the Sum set apart for the Superintendancy, And shall not.
I am Called on by the Department to explain the necessity for the use of Six horses And a Waggon And by what Authority they have been purchased Enclosed is a Copy of my letter to Co' Humphreys of the 7"
January 1826.” The Agency then was about 70 Miles from Tampa Bay—it is now about 98 Miles. The Supplies for the use of the Agency are drawn from Tampa Bay, a Waggon and Team was necessary, but the Agent Could not during the whole year Procure one. I brought one with me to this Country which the Agent desired to obtain. Owing to the circumstance of my being the Superintendant I refused to sell it to him until it was suggested that Capt DE Burch of the Quarter Masters Department, who was in the habit of procuring such articles for the Army should value it. This was done. I
submit it to the Secretary either to Approve or reject the purchase, And if rejected the loss shall be mine—but as the Agency Cannot be Supported without One (for none can be hired in that quarter) it will be necessary to purchase another, which will be done unless the Department direct otherwise.
The other two horses making Six are under my Charge and were purchased for the Department in the year 1824 at the time the Indians were removing from this part of the Country, My accounts Settled in the Spring 1825 will Shew this—That they were actually necessary then was admitted, they have been very Serviceable to the Department here And Saved Considerable expence from time to time, And except when Actually engaged in public Service, no

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE, May 29* 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, When I addressed you from St. Augustine on the 18”
Inst.” in relation to the complaints touching the manner in which the Road had been opened by Mº Bellamy, I had determined to notice the matter no farther until I should know what steps Major Pierce's report & my letter would cause you to take. But the receipt of the papers enclosed, numbered from 2 to 8, (including my letter to Gov"
Duval numbered 1,) renders it necessary both in justice to myself
& to M* Bellamy that I should take up the subject again. These papers have been furnished unsolicited by me excepting that of the Governor. But a volume such might be obtained for asking if I
thought it at all necessary. In fact was the matter left to vote but few in the Country would, I am persuaded, be found to condemn the Road. I have learnt recently that my name received no small share of abuse by persons whom I never saw or heard of, on a report being circulated that I had rejected the Road to the injury of M*
Bellamy, before I had even inspected it with a view to receiving it.—
Those numbered from 6 to 8,-were forwarded to me from Alachua County; with these persons I am personally unacquainted but some of whom are known to me by name & that they support a respectable character where they reside;—with Colonel Dill however, I have a personal acquaintance; he is as respectablea manasanyin the Country, & was a member of the Legislative Council for Florida.

568 T E PR I TO RIA L PA P E R S. is known to you personally. Mº Symington is a stranger in Florida, travelling with a view to a settlement in it hereafter, and is a very intelligent & highly respectable Gentleman. I have myself examined the Road impartially previous to, & re-examined it since the knowledge of Mº Rodman's complaint. Mº Bellamy is now at work on the road completing it in such manner as I have directed, & when it is so completed, the only possible doubt which could arise as to its construction under the contract, (for I have myself given positive directions in all the most difficult ponds & places, for making the Road,) is to what was intended to be meant by the marshy, miry, & swampy ground, requiring the ditches of 4 feet wide & 3 feet deep.
According to my judgment & my explanation of the Contract when it was entered into, there is but very little such ground on the whole route. Can it be supposed for a moment that any man but a madman would take contracts to open a Road of 212 miles, with a Stipulation to turnpike more than one hundred miles of low woods with earth dug from ditches of such dimensions & the whole floored underneath with timber? or could it be expected that a turnpike Road should be constructed, numerous streams bridged &c. &c. for four hundred miles in a Wilderness Country, for the Sum of $.28,000,—? In truth, so rigidly has the Contractor adhered to my directions in constructing the Road, doing much more work in many places than his contract required, that when it is so finished as that I should be willing to accept & certify its completion, that the investigation would in reality rest upon my conduct and not on his work. —
I am informed by Capt. Clark that the road opened by him has been approved by you upon a report of the manner of its construction.
I have never seen a foot of this Road & have heard only the most favorable accounts of it, but if comparisons could, or ought, to determine the correct performance of my own duty, or the faithful performance of this contract, I would most gladly submit this Road to the test of the comparison with his, when viewed by competent judges of such work, regard being had to the Country over which they have respectively been opened, the amount of labor bestowed on each; and the way each has been laid out. Both Roads have been travelled over by Gov" Duval, and his opinion of the one opened by me is fairly expressed in his letter.—My original intention was after this Road should have been completed in such manner as I was willing to receive it, to make to you a detailed report respecting it, describing the Country &c. &c. leaving the final decision with you as to whether the Balances of the Payments should be made.—And I firmly believe that such a course would even yet ensure as much justice to the Contractor & to the United States as any arbitration which could be had.—
<pb#593/>
F L O RI D A T E E R I TO R Y 569
I enclose a letter from the Mayor of St. Augustine * designating the point at which it was desired the Road should be brought to the St. Sebastian's, opposite to the City, & which was accordingly done.
In this case the Contractor made a causeway on the City side of the River, over the mud, for the more convenient landing of the ferry Boat, estimated by good judges to be worth $200. for which he expects to receive no compensation as it was not in his contract nor required by my instructions.—
As it appears to be the intention of the Government to increase the road to the full width contemplated by law, I will only remark that no great practical benefit to the Country or the Road can result from it, on the Contrary, it will then grow up more rapidly. The direction being from West to East it will be only used by travelling persons, for the most part on Horseback, & not for the business of the Country, hence it will have but a single track; and the open woods of this Country will allow of wagons passing each other at any point where they may happen to meet.—But as the law requires it, & most of the people of the country expect it, I should be pleased to receive an order to increase its width. If the troops remain at Pensacola, I should prefer to employ them under my own direction to increase the width, at least as far as the Appalachicola, if not for the whole route. And if any part is put out to contract, it ought to be from that River to St. Augustine, though I would prefer that no part of it should be. If it is to be done at all I should be pleased to receive my orders immediately, so as to commence on the 1* of October next, & I think that by the 31* of March ensuing it would be completed to St: Augustine.
If the fall season is lost for work, nothing of any account can be done during the winter & spring, & a postponement for the next summer would necessarily take place. An additional appropriation of $.7500
will be necessary to complete the work in that manner, if done by the troops, & $.11000, if by contract. It would not require so much by $.1500 to finish it by the labor of the troops but for the great scarcity of forage in Florida, which greatly augments the cost of transportation of supplies. Corn has been worth here throughout this season $.2.50/100 & $.3, per bushel, & there will be as great scarcity the next, owing to the demand occasioned by settlers. In New Orleans & in Pensacola both corn & hay have been equally scarce & proportionably dear.
As nothing will be done by me in relation to M* Bellamy's contract until I receive a reply to this letter, I request you will be pleased to address a duplicate of your answer to me at this place, as well as to Pensacola. It is my intention to make the contracts for the Coleraine

Bellamy under his contracts.-
A copy of my advertisement is enclosed herein. I have fixed an early day for receiving the proposals so that if I fail in the contracts, I may endeavour to do it with hired laborers. The present Season being that of the Crops, is much against getting laborers, as none but the best would be received, & those cannot be spared by the Planters."—

CAPT. DANIEL E BURCH Asst. Quarter Master. U. Army SIR Your letter of the 25 int is received, in which you request my opinion of the road as made by Mº John, Bellamy, under his contract, I have travelled on this road from Gadsden County to Alachua County a distance of more than one hundred & fifty miles, and do not hesitate to assert that for the whole distance, considering the low and swampy situation of much of the ground over which the road passes that it is decidedly the best new road I have ever seen, when M*
Bellamy shall finish the causways by adding more earth, the road will be excellent. I do not think the stumps are too high and more labour has been bestowed on the road than I had expected, knowing the appropriation was small, for a road so lengthy, -If this work had not in my judgement, been executed as was expected, I should have considered it my duty to remonstrate to the War Department.
Many of those who complain of the road no doubt expected to see a turnpike but as much and in my opinion even more has been done than I could have believed it was possible to do with the whole appropriation for this object.

SIR. An act to provide for the surveying of private claims in Florida was passed by the H. of Rep" but I very much regret that it was laid over in the Senate for want of time to Act upon it.”
As it is probable that this bill will be acted upon and become a law at a very early period of the next Session of Congress, and as little or no progress can be made in surveying the private claims until November next, and it being somewhat doubtful how far the provisions of the 13" Section of the Act of 1823 * repeals those of the 6th Section of the Act of the 8th May 1822,” It may be advisable to suspend all
<pb#597/>
contracts for the survey of private claims for the present. If however individuals insist upon having their claims surveyed and connected with the Township lines at their own expense you may cause such surveys to be so made, provided they be within the Township lines that have been run.
I enclose for your information a copy of the bill above referred to as it was amended and passed the House of Representatives. Under the provisions of this Act I have no doubt that you would in a very short period be enabled to complete the whole of the surveys of the private claims in Florida.”
With great respect &c G G.
As no advances can be made on account of the surveying of private claims, I presume the amount forwarded will be sufficient to meet the demands on you for surveying actually executed for 1826. G. G.

<docbody>GENERAL. I had the honor to receive on the 1* Inst. (by the way of Pensacola from whence it was forwarded,) your letter of the 21**
April "last enclosing one from Mº Rodman to the Secretary of War."—
And will now endeavor to give you as faithful a report of my proceedure in opening this Road under the contract with Mº Bellamy as is in my power to do, together with a description of the Country through which the Route passes; on which together with my letters of the 18th * &
29* Ulto.” I rely for my exculpation from the alledged neglect of duty as charged by M. Rodman. In relation to this Gentleman I
have only to observe that his own character, (with him personally I have no acquaintance,) as a public officer has not been such as altogether to free him from reproach, nor is it such in my opinion as to qualify him for a Censor over the officers of the Government. I
am aware, however, that to impugn the character of others is not the mode to exculpate myself & I will forbear further remark excepting this:—That when he was called upon by Mº Bellamy to know from what authority he had derived his information, & why he made the report; he stated that he had been directed by the Government to
<pb#598/>
574 T E R P I TOR I. A. L. PA PER S report upon the Road, & that as a public officer he was bound to comply; and added that his principal ground of complaint was the narrowness of the Road. This however I take to have ben a rank falsehood, for I can never believe that Mº Barbour would descend to such a mean system of espionage without some better authority for the truth of the allegation than Mº Rodman's assertion:-He is &
has long been the known deadly enemy of M* Bellamy, & to that source do I ascribe his report & not to any orders from the Government.—Governor Duval's statement in regard to the Stumps, is a full refutation to the assertion that “they are left standing to a great height.” And the known fact that the causeways & Bridges of the Road, in the very worst part of it too, have already stood near a
“twelvemonth,” including an uncommonly & extraordinary wet season, that of the last winter & spring, in their unfinished & insecure state, without sustaining the slightest injury is sufficient evidence of the falsity of the assertion that “they are absolutely good for nothing.” In truth there are no Creeks of any importance on any part of the Road opened by Mº Bellamy. When Mº Rodman stated
“that all travellers agree in stating that the work is done in the slightest manner possible,” he well knew that he had not given the opinions of all the travellers, for there were two intelligent men, as respectable as any in the City of St. Augustine, resident in the place, who had stated the reverse, & of whom he might have enquired if he was solicitous to render equal justice to all concerned in his Report, by presenting the proof on both sides of the question for the consideration of the Secretary of War. Major Pierce informed me that Mr Rodman, when called upon, stated that he had never seen the Road himself & gave up two informants only.” When the statements of those two Gentlemen are received, if you should call for either of them, I trust that as one of them is a Military Officer he may be required to give a full & detailed report of the Country he passed through, its general & particular character; and to designate particularly what parts of the work was objectionable, also what Bridges are spoken of, the streams they are over, size, description, sources, character &c. &c. When called upon to make a report in this manner he will find it both more difficult to fix his objections upon particular places, & to offer his own suggestions in the way of improvements than to say in general terms, all is bad, or, all is good. I will further remark that as the Road was not such as he could travel by the way of Picolata, when he visited Tallahassee, he did not come on it at all until he arrived at the St: Fé natural Bridge 85 miles west of St: Augustine; and from thence to Tallahassee, this report will shew that two thirds of the way is high dry ridges, or either oak
<pb#599/>
or Pine woods. Nor had any other person travelled that part of it at the time when M* Rodman wrote his letter.—
First; as to the Country:-Commencing at the Ocholochonee River it is high rolling pine Barrens & oak woods to the Aussillee River, a distance of 41 miles. on this part of the Road there are neither low grounds nor streams of any importance; and but one that presents the least obstruction, being a pond drain, full & wide in wet seasons, but lost in the dry seasons. This has been bridged and causewayed in the most permanent manner, the causeway being made of logs two deep in many places, & as the swamp was not suitable for ditching, the causeway is completely covered with earth carried on to it. The Swamp was itself a hard sand & but for the water with which it is flooded in rainy seasons, did not require any Causeway at all. This work was done exactly according to my positive directions. There is also a small stream which sinks into the ground just above the Road;
but in very heavy floods of Rain the Sink is insufficient to vent the water, & it consequently runs over the Road for about 150 yards, which is here a dry, sandy, Hammock; and even when fullest, which rarely occurs & then never lasts more than two or three days, presents no serious obstruction to passing it with carriages or wagons.—
It would not have been proper to make a raised Causeway through this Hammock, for it could only have served to dam up the water to a greater height, when it would have had to vent itself over the Causeway, tearing it to pieces in such a manner, each freshet, as to render it impracticable until repaired. This place has been completed under my directions & much work is done that could not have been required of the Contractor, for there is no miry ground in any part of the Hammock. Likewise at the Aussillee River, the whole way through the swamp, (or rather Hammock for it is not a swamp,)
has been ditched and thrown up, though the whole was a firm hard white sand, without the least appearance of marsh or mire. At this River I directed a ferry flat to be built & a ferry established in lieu of the Bridge, because I found by long experience & knowledge of the River that it was the only sure means of passing it at all seasons.—
This River is not fed by springs, but is the outlet of extensive ponds
& Savannahs, hence in very dry seasons it is an insignificant looking stream, sometimes fordable at the ferry even, but in time of heavy Rains it is swoln into a large River, & at such times after crossing the Bridge, the traveller would have found swimming water for more than a quarter of a mile through the low grounds. The selection of the Route on this Section of the Road has been along the highest ridges, avoiding the small ponds & steep declivities, meeting altogether my fullest approbation.—
<pb#600/>
576 T E R P I TO RIA L PA P E R S. Second:—From the Ausillee River to the Suwannee River, a distance of 42 miles, the land is in general low flat pine woods, (with occasional ridges,) of hard, firm, sand, spotted with numerous ponds & grassy places, through which it was with great difficulty that a Road could be selected at all.—The low and grassy places of this section have been ditched & thrown up, and The largest of the Ponds, (of which there were three very large & deep) on this part of the Road have been causewayed with timber in a permanent manner, the whole covered with earth carried on to them, for in such places it was impracticable to ditch, the earth being a firm, hard, & fine sandy bottom, in many places two feet under water. Two attempts were made to causeway the two largest of these ponds, without succeeding, owing to the quantity of water in them; & by one of those attempts the Contractor lost two months work of all his hands, in consequence of my having directed them to be brought away from another & distant section of the Road where it was dry & where they were at work;-
just at the moment they commenced at the Ponds, a heavy rain set in & rendered their efforts to work fruitless. The causeways in these ponds have been constructed according to my directions and are permanent, being raised by layers of large logs above the water &
covered with earth. About six miles west of the Suwannee, there are two creeks & one pond drain, breaking through the high pine woods like artificial canals, the largest of which is not in common times ten feet wide, but which in heavy Rains raise to a very full height. These are Bridged. This Section of the Road was the most difficult from Pensacola to St: Augustine. The selection of the route through it
& the construction of the Road itself, are much better than I had ever expected them to be.—In fact it is such a Road that unless in uncommonly wet seasons, when it is by no means difficult, it is as easy for carriages to pass over as the highest pine Barrens or Oak woods on the whole route.—
Third;—From the Suwannee to a point eight miles East of the St. Fé Natural Bridge, a distance of 52 miles in all, the whole way is on dry Sand Hills, and needed nothing but to be opened. The growth is scattering pine, & the ground almost destitute of herbage. For the first 48 miles of this section there is not a stream nor a Rod of low grounds for the Road to cross, the greatest difficulty is want of water for the traveller to drink, there being none except in Limestone Sinks
& that very scarce indeed. This is as handsome a stretch of straight Road as I have ever seen in any Country.—At the St: Fé natural Bridge, it is sometimes interrupted by very high waters when the sink is not sufficient to vent the water & it flows over the lowest part of the ground. In this place I have caused a dam to be thrown up in what is apparently high dry woods, of near six feet high, with a good foot
<pb#601/>
F. L. O. He I D A T E R P I TO R Y 577
way along side of it raised wholly out of reach of water. This work was done by my directions, was very considerable, and is wholly out of reach of the Contract; but no objections were made by the Contractor to performing it when required by me to do so.
Fourth:-From thence to St: Augustine, a distance of 77 miles, the Country is in general flat, not however without occasional extensive dry Ridges, some of them being very high ranges of Sand Hills. The flat woods is spotted with almost innumerable ponds & low grassy places. all the low places in this part of the route which could require it, & even more according to the letter of my directions, have been ditched & thrown up; Ph Hike Haahher and East of the St: John’s River near one fourth of the whole way has been ditched & thrown up. In like manner a Causeway or landing place for the ferry Boat has been made on the City side of the St. Sebastians River worth in labor at least $.200, neither required by the Contract nor by my directions.
It is certainly very useful now that it is made, but it was by no means necessary in my opinion, particularly if a Bridge is to be built over the River. Through this route there are no creeks, but some occasional pond drains of no importance, & dry, excepting in Rainy Seasons.—
These flat woods or pine Glades throughout Florida along the route of the Road, are much subject to being covered with water, but they are not the more difficult of being travelled over on that account, as they are uniformly of hard, white, sand equally firm & clear of bogging in wet as in dry seasons. Boggy ground is only to be found in Florida among the high sand hills; & there, in wet seasons, the hollow places are absolutely impassable if a step is taken out of the beaten trail or Road.—
In regard to the Stumps, they were directed by me to be cut hollowing into the Centre; for, according to the experience of others more versed in such matters than myself, added to my own observation, it greatly facilitates their being rotted out by the retention of the Rain &
moisture; and this very circumstance now makes them appear higher than they really are. If scarfed off on the outsides they would appear to be cut very low down.—My directions were to cut them where the swell of the roots is joined to the trunk of the tree, which is as low as I thought necessary & is as low as I ever saw any cut. If they had been cut lower, it would have been the easiest method for the Contractor to have dug up the trees entirely by the Roots. I can assert with truth that there is not a Stump left in the whole Road, not even from the largest trees, which could obstruct the passage over it of the lowest constructed Carriage now in use.—
In regard to the Causeways I have to state that they are both permanently & fully made so as to be passed now as easily and as safely
<pb#602/>
578 T E R F I TOR I. A. L. PA P E R S. as they ever will be, but they are not finished in such a manner as that I am satisfied with them either with the quantity of dirt carried on to them, or in their being secured by riders staked over them. And the Bridges are not covered with such planks or puncheons as I require.
The main object which I have always kept in view is now accomplished, to have the Road opened & placed in travelling order throughout its extent, without stopping the progress of the work to dwell upon unimportant particulars; and the Contractor is now at work with all his hands completing the Road under my directions, as was always his intention to do.—
The Contract itself under which Mº Bellamy worked merits some remark, in the way of explanation, from me. By your orders I
required that the Contractor should work wholly under my directions, which is fully & repeatedly expressed under the severe penalty of an entire forfeiture if he failed so to do. Under such a stipulation it was necessary for him to know the utmost limits to which I should go with such directions; hence the precise stipulations respecting the depth & width of the ditches, to be dug in Swampy, miry, & Marshy ground; the width & manner of securing the Causeways; & the mode of constructing the Bridges. I have frequently deviated from the exact letter of the contract in the ditches at the Causeways, for it would have been absurd to require a ditch to be dug where it was wholly useless, merely because the contract so expressed it;-the only object in having ditches at all at the Causeways was to obtain earth sufficient to cover the poles & timber of which they were made.
But on the other side of the question under the same stipulation, I
have required a great deal of work to be done on the Road more than was expressed in the contract, as for instance, in ditching & throwing up certain places in the low sandy, pine woods,--This ditching &
throwing up presents now only banks of fine white sand, soft &
unpleasant to travel over; & if the Road was to be examined now that it is an uncommonly dry season, by persons unacquainted with the real situation of the Country, it would appear that the whole of that kind of work was wholly useless, as well as many of the Causeways, &
all the Bridges that have been built; so perfectly firm & hard is the way throughout.—
In se!eeting constructing this Road I have spared no pains in selecting the best route, & according to my judgement in directing how the work should be done; and as I would answer on my conscience before my God I have never spared the Contractor in his work, of which he has frequently complained to me, though never to others, to my knowledge. And I have no hesitation in saying that although in some places, I might with troops, have made the work of smoother appearance, yet it would not have been more permanent in its char-
<pb#603/>
acter; and also that the Contractor has in many places done work in ditching & throwing up, that I should have wholly passed over with troops.-This Road has been four several times inspected by me during its progress, viz: in May, & in September 1825; and in February, & at the present time, of this year. At the first inspection made, if I had not found that the work was not going on well I would have most certainly stopped all further proceedings, both to save the Contractor from a useless expenditure of time & labor; & that the United States might not have the final completion of the work delayed by his incompetency to perform the work properly. The manner in which the Road has been laid out, & the selection of the ground would have done him credit, if there had been nothing else to recommend his work, in the opinions of persons competent to judge of such matters, & who were also acquainted with the general face of the Country through which it passes.—
And I now repeat that when the Road is finished so as that I am willing to receive it & certify that it is completed according to the Contract & my directions, it will no longer be a question affecting the Contractor or his contract; but a decision as to whether I have opened the Road according to the views of the Government or not.
I will not therefore disguise from you the fact, General, that although I have requested another person to be appointed to inspect this Road when it is completed; yet if you are satisfied with, and approve of my conduct in relation to this Road upon receiving my reports of the 18" & 29* Ulto. and the documents enclosed therein, taken together with this letter, it would be infinitely more grateful to my feelings that the inspection & receipt of the Road should still be left with me; but if you determine otherwise I shall be perfectly content to acquiesce in your decision. There is no duty to perform, in the range of the duties of Quarter Master, that could possibly have exposed his conduct to more animadversion than this of opening Roads where there were so many conflicting interests & opinions brought to bear upon the officer & his work; to say nothing of the evil-minded whose only delight is to vilify others. If superceded in any manner whatever at this moment, it will be immediately said that it was for misconduct & I shall be made to suffer when conscious of having never swerved from my duty. The Road will be completed about the first of august if the rains should not set in so violently as to prevent it.—The Contractor has labored under many difficulties
& suffered many delays in his work in consequence of the very uncommonly rainy year last past. It is perfectly within my knowledge that there has never been a suitable time for opening the Road, with any economy of work, through the low pondy country from the
<pb#604/>
580 T E R P I TO RIA L PA P E R S. time the Contract was entered into until the first of March last; and the Country is now as dry as it has been heretofore wet.—
Through the whole route from this place to St. Augustine the Country is, after passing the Aussillee, a barren wilderness, & no point of it afforded supplies. Hence instead of paying $.16,000, on these Contracts, if it had been opened by the troops, on so long a line of land transportation as it necessarily is from St. Marks Eastwardly, the extra expenses alone for the troops would have amounted to upwards of $.20,000,—on the closest & most economical calculation that I can make.

<docbody>SIR I have just received your letter of the 2° of May,” and though exposed to the imputation of having acted under the honest convictions of a deceptive judgement; I see no reason in your report or the evidence on which it was founded to change the opinion expressed by me of the capacity of the country as originally defined to sustain the Indians intended to be located on it—The Governors report on the subject” is founded on a partial examination of a very limited portion of the district set apart for the Indians, and Mr Chairs acknowledges in his statement he has seen but a very small part of the country—
It is not however to maintain opinions expressed, or so much to prevent any extension of territory to the Indians if deemed necessary by the Executive, as to guard you against a too confident reliance on the supposed cause of past distresses among the savages of Florida, that I again address you on this subject—The Indians have always been in possession of a greater extent of land than that defined in the Treaty, and they now have had yielded to them what they themselves acknowledge fully equal to their support—If too much reliance therefore is placed on this single fact as an atonement for the past, and a guarantee for the future, I apprehend we may defer untill too late the only corrective to the irregularities which have been, and will be continued to be committed by our Red Neighbors—I am not unwilling to deny that the ordinary (and in this case probably the extraordinary, embarrassments incident to a removal to a new country, have not been without their agency in producing much of the distresses reported Creek to Coleraine a distance of fifty six miles was put under contract in July last—the Contractors have stipulated to complete it by the 31st of December;

I beg you to seriously consider their origin, the dis-cordant and restless materials which are united in the composition of their population, and their whole history, for it is only upon a thorough knowledge of these that any system can be successfully put in operation, to check their future irregularities, bring them under proper subordination and ameliorate their condition—I regret the necessity of intruding upon you any further correspondence on this subject, and though the opinions expressed may have very little influence on the policy, the President may determine to pursue, yet it ought not to deter me (from my past agency in our Indians affairs and from the known exposed situation of some of the settlements in Florida), from placing at your disposal the information my opportunities have enabled me to collect &

From the East Florida Herald. St. Augustine, June 6.
From Key West.—By the Revenue Cutter Marion, Capt. Doane,”
which anchored off our bar on Friday morning last, we are gratified to learn that the Light vessel on the Dry Tortugas has been of the
<pb#608/>
most essential service in warning vessels of approaching danger.
Four ships lately have been entirely indebted to the warnings of the bells of the light vessel. Employment for the wreckers diminishes daily, and some of them have left the wrecking ground.
The Bahama Turtlers who have heretofore occupied the Florida coast in pursuit of that employment, to the number of twenty or thirty vessels, have been turned off by Capt. Doane, so that this lucrative branch of business, is reserved exclusively for American enterprize.
This is a just measure. No American dare approach the West Indian coasts without being subject to seizure; and while we are excluded from the benefits of fishing on British ground, it would be unjust for them to occupy ours.
Saw off Cape Florida the Spanish squadron under Commodore Laborde, consisting of 4 heavy Frigates, Sloop of War and Gun Brig, cruising apparently for some vessels.

JN° BELLAME Esq Tallahasse Flo.
SIR, I received, yesterday your letter of the 19* ulto,” on the subject of the roads opened by you in Florida, under contracts with Capt. Burch, and have, in compliance with your request, which had been preceeded by a similar one from Capt Burch, determined to relieve him from the delicate responsibility, which, under existing circumstances would attach to him, in the duty of inspecting and receiving those roads.
Captain Isaac Clark, Assistant Q Master at Tampa Bay, and who has some experience in respect to roads, has been appointed to make the inspection, and is ordered to repair to Tallahassee, as early as practicable, with a view to the immediate performance of this duty, where he is advised he will meet both yourself and Capt Burch.
As there are other individuals besides yourself, parties to the first contract, it will be necessary, in order to provide against any after objections to Capt Clark's decisions, that a formal agreement should be signed, substituting him for Capt Burch, in regard to the inspection under the contract.
In making this arrangement, it is understood, that Capt Clark merely takes the place of Captain Burch, for the single purpose of inspecting and receiving the roads—the necessity of your appointing a person to act with him is therefore, not seen. Should you and him disagree in opinion, as to the defects, if any, of the roads when offered for inspection, the fifth article of the first contract which is adopted in the second, prescribes the course to be pursued—and it is deemed proper not to deviate from this prescription, though your proposition is, in every other view, unobjectionable.
I have instructed Capt Clark, in the performance of the duty assigned to him, to take the contracts for his guide, and to endeavor, whilst he guards the public interest, to do you justice. I hope there will be no disagreement between you ultimately, as to the work still necessary to render the roads conformable to the terms of the contracts—but if there should be, it is expected that the umpire which the contracts provide for, will be forthwith appointed, and his decision, if it impose additional work on you, speedily executed. Captain

<place-time>Copy ST: AUGUSTINE 10th June 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, The sloop Splendid, Captain Johnson of New York, Seized by Capt: Doane on this Coast for a violation of the revenue laws, going with an enrolment and license on a wrecking voyage within the Spanish dominions, has arrived here, and has been libeled in the Superior Court of this district. The trial is fixed for the 26* Inst:
The Court has appointed Mº Cornell, a young gentleman of the bar her to act as District attorney until the gentleman appointed by the President arrives. I have drawn the libel myself and shall assist him in the prosecution but I deem it advisable to employ additional Counsel, and presume that a moderate charge for Counsel fees, in case of condemnation would be allowed by the Government, out of the property Sold. There will be no fee paid, if no condemnation take place. Please let me Know if such a charge would be allowed.
The portion of the fee which I think ought to be charged to the United States will be fifty dollars. Capt: Doane will probably agree to allow fifty dollars more. And one hundred is the least that (I can expect)—any lawyer of talents and respectability would take as a compensation in a case of this nature. The vessel seized is estimated to be worth about $2.000 *—
As the transactions at Key West in regard to the wrecking business have produced much sensation in the Sea ports of the United States where insurance had been effected on the property wrecked, and saved by the wreckers, and as many facts have come to my Knowledge evincing the irregularity and inequity of many of those transactions, I take the liberty to invite the attention of the Government to this Subject. I am perfectly convinced that no advantage has resulted, and none can result to the government, by the making of Key West a
<pb#612/>
588 T E R P I TO P I A L PA P E R S port of Entry. It has been the means of giving encouragement and protection to every species of smuggling, and to admit every Kind of depredations upon fair and regular commerce.
I take the liberty to refer you to a communication on this Subject published in the East Florida Herald of the 30th of last month signed Amicus Floridae, one of the numbers of which paper I sent to you by the last mail. The facts stated in that article have been confirmed to me by persons entitled to credit. Mº Simonton's address, to which that article was answer, is full of errors and misrepresentations.
The facts mentioned in a note to the communication respecting the Smuggling of the Quicksilver, is undoubtedly true; and it was done in a manner almost openly under the eyes of the Collector or some of his officers. Capt: Johnson the master of the Sloop now under Seizure here has informed me, that he was at Key West at the time of the arrival of the Spanish Ship Tarantula there, and saw all the quicksilver landed from that vessel. It was immediately carried over to the Havana. The business was conducted by a person who had been previously employed in the custom house but had for some cause or other not Known recently left that employment. He was Known to be worth nothing before this transaction took place, but soon afterwards boasted that he was worth $20,000—He has since gone to the North. Capt: Johnson was unwilling to give me his name. I have reason however to believe that his name is James B.
Lauring, and the same person sailed from Key West as master of a small schooner called the Mary M*Coy which touched at this port on the 16** of January last, hence went to Charleston and thence to New York. I suspect he has returned to this Coast on a wrecking voyage. When he was here I had not heard of this affair. There can be no doubt that smuggling is carried on very extensively at Key West as well in regard to wrecked goods subject to duty, as to Colonial produce introduced from the Havana. I do not Know that the Collector of that port, when there himself, is deficient in vigilance, but he is often absent for a long time, and he has not had good officers under him. He has lately appointed a gentleman by the name of Fry (who was a clerk of our Legislative Council during the last Session) as Deputy Collector, Mº Pinkney himself intending soon to leave the Island, and to be absent for a considerable time. Mr Fry was recommended to him by Col: Walton, the Secretary of this Territory, who also holds the Commission of Auctioneer for the Island of Key West, granted to him by the Governor of this Territory, though never nominated as the law requires to the Legislative Council.
M* Fry, for aught I Know may be well qualified for the discharge of the duties of Deputy Collector at Key West, but I was not a little
<pb#613/>
surprised be at his name lately, as one of the arbitrators, in a wrecking case which came under the operation of the new System of Arbitration adopted on that Island. Capt: Johnson declares that it will be impossible to prevent smuggling at Key West, unless an Inspector of approved honesty and courage, should be stationed at every ten paces all round the Island; that boats laden with colonial produce from the Havana, may easily land any goods in every part of the Island. I
take the liberty with great respect, to suggest for your Consideration, as a partial remedy for this evil, that orders be sent to the Collectors of the Atlantic ports, directing them to admit no goods of any description to be brought from Key West, without a special, and detailed certificate of transportation accompanying them certified by the collector of that port. The ordinary coasting manifests with a general oath and certificate endorsed on them, are in my opinion, altogether insufficient, with respect to goods shipped from that Island, to guard against frauds upon the revenue. Under the present regulations at all the Custom houses particular certificates of transportation are Sent only with merchandise intended to be exported for the benefit of drawback. It is the easiest thing in the world to ship from Key West, for Charleston, Baltimore or New York, a large quantity of sugar and coffee which may have been Smuggled into that Island, under a general coasting manifest with scarsely any risk of detection it may be landed on its arrival at any port in the United States. There is not one man in a hundred that cares a Straw about custom house oaths. Besides, let it be recollected that only the oath of the Master of the vessel is required to these coasting manifests and he only swears to the best of his Knowledge and belief, that the duties have been paid or Secured. The owner as shipper of the goods, makes no oath whatever. I have no doubt that the four fifths of the coffee and sugar sent from Key West to Charleston have never paid a cent of duty to the U. S.—With respect to drawbacks, it appears from the report lately made to the House of Representatives, in answer feeha to a call for an account of the revenue collected at Key West, that a very large portion of the amount of duties collected there in 1824 was represented by drawback, and it is deserving of consideration whether there have not been some errors committed in this matter.
Captain Doane of the revenue cutter Marion has assured me that to his certain Knowledge drawback has been allowed on goods exported from Key West to Havana. The Collector may have mistaken the law on this subject.
I hope you will excuse this long letter but before I close it permit me to observe that the cutter Marion is of much too large a draught of water to be of much service on this coast. She cannot approach the
<pb#614/>
reefs, but at a considerable distance, and could not pursue any small vessel close along the Coast, engaged in Smuggling or in the violation of the Slave acts. The cutter Florida which was previously on this coast draws only Six feet water is a fast sailor and is much better calculated to cruise among the Florida Keys and along our Coast. I think it would be highly beneficial to the revenue, and well worth the expense, to have a Small tender, of light draught of water, that would not cost above One thousand dollars, to accompany the Cutter, and go among the Keys and on the reefs, and to be ready to cummunicate frequently with this port. The iniquitous proceedings which have for some time past been carried on at Key West, cannot continue long.
Congress will I humbly conceive, at the next Session, be sensible of the propriety of abolishing the custom house there, and should that event take place, almost all the wreckers will come here with the goods saved from shipwreck. Indeed the numerous suits lately brought by the insurance Companies in New York against one of these men, will convince them that their only Security for a fair and reasonable salvage is the adjudication of a Court of admiralty.
I have the honor to be, with great respect Sir, Your Ob" Servant JOHN RODMAN
Collector of St: Augustine To, THE HON” RICHARD RUSH Secretary of the Treasury Washington.
P. S. Since writing the foregoing I have received Some further information in regard to the object for which the Schooner John Richard has Sailed frem for Nassau and I have now but little doubt that it is an expedition to bring Slaves into this Territory. The number I understand is about one hundred and that instead of their being landed (as was at first conjectured would take place) on this Coast, they will probably be carried to the coast along the gulph of Mexico and put on shore somewhere between Tampa Bay and St.
Marks. The father of one of the persons presumed to be engaged in this affair, resides near Tallahassee and is well Calculated to afford every facility to the enterprise. Indeed I doubt whether a Single individual could be found at Tallahasse who would throw any obstacle in the way of its accomplishment, afterwards or in aid in the detention of the offence. It will be a very easy matter after these slaves are landed to spread them in the interior of the Country, and gradually afterwards dispose of them as the owners may see fit. I greatly fear that there is but little chance of the vessels being intercepted on her voyage on her approach to any part of the shore of the gulph of Mexico between the points I have mentioned for it will probably be too late to send any effectual orders to the Commanders of any of the armed vessels of the United States at Pensacola or Mobile; and it
<pb#615/>
F L OR I. D A T E E R I TO R Y 591
will be equally impracticable for the Marion to go round to the gulph in time to be of any use. However the vessel sent on this expedition may possibly, by some cause or other, be detained at Nassau, for a longer time than those concerned in the enterprise calculate; And upon that presumption, it may still be advisable to despatch orders to some of the commanders of the armed vessels of the U. States at Pensacola to Cruise along the Coast of the gulph in search of this vessel.

<place-time>Land Office TALLAHASSEE 15* June 1826–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. We have seen published in the National Journal an Act of Congress giving the right of pre-emption in lands to certain Settlers in Florida.”
Foreseeing many difficulties and embarrassments, which will probably arise in carrying this law in to effect, and perceiving that it is
<pb#616/>
based on a former Act of Congress entitled an Act giving the right of pre-emption in the purchase of lands to certain settlers in the Illinois Territory passed Feb. 5* 1813,” we have deemed it expedient to ask some information with regard to the proceedings had under the last mentioned act.
It appears from the Law that the Register and Receiver are made the Judges of the rights of individuals accruing under this act, we would respectfully enquire the manner in which the evidence in behalf of the claimants should be taken. Whether it should only be delivered verbally by the Witnesses in the presence of the Receiver and Register, or whether it should be reduced to writing and a report thereof made to the department.
The 1* Section of this act provides “that every person or the legal representatives of any person &c” shall be entitled to the right of pre-emption in certain cases, and under certain conditions. It also provides, “that no more than one Q." Section of Land shall be sold to any one individual in virtue of this Act.” We would here enquire first, what is understood at the Department by the words “one Q'
Section,” do they mean the one fourth part of an entire Section, or may they be construed so as to signafy two contiguous and adjoining eights of different Sections? This is a question of considerable importance both to the Government and to individuals.
We would next enquire whether the same person can enter one quarter section by virtue of his own Settlement and cultivation, and an other quarter Section as the “legal Representative” or assignee of an other person. We will here State the case as it will most frequently occur. In the year 1822 A, improved a Qt Section, in 1823
he sold his improvement to B, who in 1824 improved an other Q"
Section himself, is B entitled to a pre-emption in both the quarter Section which he improved and the one he purchased from A. If he be entitled to both in what manner and form should the one he purchased from A be entered so as to designate it from the one he himself improved, and make it conformable to the proviso of the 1st Section of the Act of 1813, which prohibits the entry of more than one Q' Section of Land by the same individual. We request to be informed generaly of the proceedings under the Act of 1813.
We have the honour to be Very Respectfully Your Obt Svº

Captain Daniel E. Burch, Asst. Qr. Master of the Army of the United States, with Francis J. Ross and Davis Floyd, of Florida:
Articles of Agreement made and entered into this first day of July, 1826, between Francis J. Ross of Duval County, and Davis Floyd of St. Johns’ County in the Territory of Florida, of the one part, and Captain Daniel E. Burch, Assistant Q Master of U. S. Army, Agent for the United States of America of the other part, Witnesseth:
Article First.—The said Francis J. Ross and Davis Floyd, for and in consideration of the sum of Nineteen hundred and twenty dollars, hereafter to be paid to the said Francis J. Ross, his heirs, executors, &" has, and doth agree to the following conditions: for the faithful performance of which they hereby bind themselves, their heirs, executors, &" in the penal sum of Nineteen Hundred and Twenty Dollars.
Article Second.—The parties to the first part hereof, agree to open and construct a Road from the ferry on Black Creek in Florida, (which will be ither Hogan's or Branning's, at my election to be designated hereafter) on the nearest and best route by “Gravelly Hill” to the “King's Road” in Florida, to intersect it at or near
“Six Mile Creek Bridge” so that the point of intersection shall be to the southward of said Bridge, but as near to it as the nature of the Country will permit.” The route for the Road is to be opened and constructed in straight reaches twenty feet wide throughout; the trees to be cut so low as that the stumps shall not present any obstruction to Carriages passing over them; all timber, brushwood, and other impediments, to be cleared out and removed therefrom; and holes in the ground to be filled up and levelled. All marshy, miry, swampy ground, of a boggy nature is to be causewayed with logs or poles cut fifteen feet in length, to be secured at the sides with riders firmly staked down, and to be covered with dirt to a sufficient depth to render them a smooth Road, dug either from ditches alongside or

596 T E E R I TO R. I. A. L. PA P E R S carried on to them. The low, Savannah ground of a miry nature, is to be ditched and thrown up so as to make a firm good road. All branches, Streams, Creeks, or lagoons that are swimming at any time whatever for horses, or such as have boggy bottoms and banks, are to be bridged with good substantial bridges, built of durable and lasting timber, the flooring to be ither of plank or sawed puncheons;
and built so high and to be out of the reach of being swept off by freshets. Such small branches or streams as have firm, sandy bottoms and banks, that are never full to swimming for horses, may be left as fords, the banks to be properly dug down. In the causeways, or in places where the ground is ditched and thrown up, requiring a passage to be left for the drain of the water, either open ground sewers, or hollow sewers, are to be constructed of logs or poles of suitable size.
Article Third.—The parties to the first part hereof do agree to complete said Road and to have it ready for delivery to the party of the second part, or his legal successors in Office, on or before the 31**
of December, 1826.
Article Fourth.-It is mutually agreed by the contracting parties, that when the said Road is reported to said Burch as being ready for delivery, that either he, or his legal successor in office, shall immediately thereafter attend for the purpose of inspecting it; and further, that previous to its being received, it shall be then inspected in the presence of the said parties, by two disinterested persons; one of whom to be appointed by said party of the first part, and one by the said party of the second part; these two having authority to appoint a third person to decide and settle any difference of opinion arising between them, regarding the work done, having reference to this contract; and upon the certificate of these Commissioners, or of any two of them in case of the appointment of a third, that the road is opened and constructed according to this contract, the party to the second part hereof, as agent for the U. States, stipulates that the said Road shall be received, and that payment of the said sum of Nineteen Hundred and twenty dollars, shall be made to the said Francis J.

<docbody>To The President of the United States.
We the undersigned inhabitants of Duval County, in Florida beg leave respectfully to request the attention of your Excellency to the present situation of the Indians within this Territory. It is known to your Excellency that a treaty was concluded with these Indians in 1823,” defining certain limits within which they were to be concentrated early in 1824; and that subsequently a survey and sale of the lands, in part, on which they had resided was made. We had reasonably calculated that this measure would have been carried into effect and the Indians removed from among the settlers; but we have the mortification to find that large numbers of them have been constantly suffered to roam through our settlements without control, killing up our Stock of cattle and hogs and pulling corn from the fields for their subsistence: we have submitted to these depredations and injuries a long time under the hope that our rights and privileges as citizens of the United States, in the undesturbed possession of our own property, would not be utterly overlooked and neglected;
and now finally beg leave to represent to your Excellency that unless something effectual be done shortly in our behalf, by the concentration of the Indians within their own boundaries, necessity will compel us, for the preservation and rightful enjoyment of our hard-earned possessions in the wilderness to resort to means within our own strength. and And resources for restraining the excesses of these Indians; and moreover, of punishing them in a summary manner when caught in the fact of depredating upon our own property.—For losses already sustained and such as may occur in future we shall confidently look to the justice of the Goverment for indemnity and remuneration *

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE, July 9° 1826.</place-time>
GENERAL, I have the honor to report that I have made contracts for opening the Road from St. Mary's River to Black Creek,” which are enclosed herewith; also copies of all the proposals received, and of the advertisement on which they are based.* The terms are very reasonable & will cost less than if I had hired hands to work under my own superintendence. The contracts are taken by men living on the line of Road; one residing at Gravelly Hill, & one near Jacksonville, (which last place is six miles from “Six mile creek”, at the crossing of the “King's Road” on the St. John's River, and six miles from Gravelly Hill,) hence they could perform the work cheaper than others. The contract made on the “King's Road” will complete so much of it towards St. Augustine; comprising nearly one half of the whole distance & more than one half of the entire labor. In making these contracts I have Stipulated for the full width that can ever be intended for the Road to be made, in order to save future work on it, or dissatisfaction as to the width:-the “King's Road” to be 25 feet wide, & the remaining part 20 feet wide. From the failure of the bill making additional appropriations for Roads in Florida I am aware that the amounts contracted for on this will exceed (added to the expenses of the troops about to work under Capt. Clark,) the amount of money appropriated, but it is now too late to retract;
and in any event I should have considered your order as imperative upon me to have the road opened. Moreover, the present reduced price of cotton operates so favorably on labor that these contracts are highly advantageous to the Government—The proposals will
<pb#625/>
shew the various estimates placed upon the value of the labor to be performed by the different Individuals proposing.
If it can be done in anticipation of the passage of this Bill at the next Session of Congress,” I would suggest the expediency of making immediate contracts for continuing the “King's Road” without delay from “Six mile creek” to Smyrna; or at least reopen and repair it as far as St. Augustine or Tomoka. Colo: Gadsden's estimate for the whole route from the St. Mary's River to new Smyrna is $.11000;
but his estimate was based upon the employment of the Troops, consequently is not a correct standard for contracts. But still, I am quite positive that I can get the contracts taken & the Road completed under that estimate, now that a part of it is taken off by making the Road on it to Wantons; even if each appropriation is made to bear its own share of that contract.—
I enclose herewith a paragraph cut out of the East Florida Herald of the 13* June last published in St. Augustine,” believing it possible that it might meet your eye, & if unnoticed & uncontradicted by me produce an unfavorable impression. The statement is utterly false with the single exception that I did send the advertisements to the Commanding officer of the Post—I believe six or seven in number.
The facts are these;—I received your order on the 25* May” &
immediately caused a sufficient number of hand bills to be printed;
which were distributed in ample numbers to every section of Florida, and along the seaboard of Georgia, addressing them to the Postmasters with a request that they should be posted up and distributed; besides, availing myself of private conveyances to distribute them through the Country; so that by the date when this paragraph appeared in the St.
Augustine paper there was scarcely a man in Florida, even in the remote corners of the pine woods, who did not know of the advertisement. Conscious that if your orders to have it opened this season were to be fulfilled, no time should be lost, I appointed to meet the persons wishing to propose, at a central point between the two sections, in order that they might, when examing the routes preparatory to offering, at once put in their proposals and know the result. If I had appointed to receive the proposals at Tallahassee or Pensacola, three months at least would have been lost in receiving & answering the proposals, and in closing the contracts. I did not publish it in the newspapers because I knew that neither the one printed at St. Augustine or at Tallahassee had sufficient circulation in the country to render it of any consequence that I should do so; and in all cases previous to this last, as well as it also, I depended for the publication of the adver-
<pb#626/>
602 T E R P I TO He I A L PA P E R S tisement much more upon the hand bills than upon the newspapers.
Notwithstanding the Editor states he could not get one of the advertisements so as to publish it, yet it appears that that difficulty was afterwards removed, for I have observed that he did publish it in a subsequent paper. It is useless, nay it would be tiresome, to trouble you with the detail of the causes why I am thus honored with the notice of the Editor of this paper, but I may say that it is not to any interest that either he or those who write for his paper really feel for the improvement & prosperity of the Territory; scarcely one of them all either owning a foot of land or possessed of other property in it.”

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours 1”
Ult” " covering a Bill, providing for the survey of the private claims in Florida, but which, for the want of time was laid over by the Senate—
I should have been pleased to have seen that Bill, a law; with the exception of the 8* Section in the original, which has no connection with the general provisions of the Bill, and which will be opposed if attempted to be passed at the next Congress—I beg leave therefore to suggest to your mind the propriety of having that section stricken from the Bill for the following reasons—When I was ordered to this section of country in 1814 *—to open my Office and enter on my official duties, I purchased from a Gentleman resident here his improvement in houses and open land (situated on the quarter section which seems to be embraced by this section of the Original Bill,)
which enabled me to commence the immediate execution of my duties, and I have at much expence added largely to said improvements since the purchase—Some time after my occupancy, this quarter was reserved among several others as I am told by the Acting Governor of Florida— -
<pb#627/>
On the passage of the Pre-emption law,” believing myself entitled under its provisions to the purchase of said Quarter, I applied to the Register & Receiver at Tallahassee for this purpose, and was refused on the ground that the quarter was reserved, although the reservation was made long subsequent to inhabitation and improvement; I
therefore prayed and obtained a Mandammus returnable to next court requiring the Register & Receiver to shew cause: and I mean to takethequestion to the Supreme Court of the United States if it becomes necessary—As this subject is therefore before the Judiciary and in all probability will not soon be acted on, and being determined to have any disposition of said property by Congress opposed, until a final decision is had it might throw difficulties in the way of the passage of an Act otherwise very important—
I have received from the Treasurer his Draft on Mobile for Dollars—
10.000 which will complete the payment of the Surveys executed, all of which have been returned into the Office except Mº Washingtons &
M" M* Neils and they are daily looked for having been some time in preparing them *—

<place-time>Sº AUGUSTINE 11” July 1826</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, The prompt attention which you had the goodness to bestow on a representation which I took the liberty to make to you, some
<pb#628/>
weeks ago, * respecting the public road, lately opened between this place and Tallahassee, induces me to address you on another subject of a very alarming nature, and of the highest importance to the peace and security of the inhabitants of this Territory. I allude to the unsettled State of the Indians, and the outrages which they have recently Committed in this district. I beg leave to refer you, for the particulars of these depredations, to an article in the East Florida Herald, printed in this place, a copy of which paper I have the honour herein to enclose.”
# The inhabitants of this City and of the neighbouring Country are now greatly excited and justly alarmed. They consider their lives and property in imminent danger.
We have only one small company (about 50 men) of United States troops stationed in this place.
Major Gen" Scott came here, a few weeks ago, and withdrew an entire Company from the Garrison here, and sent it to Savannah in Georgia, notwithstanding the most urgent remonstrances, and a petition from the inhabitants entreating that these troops, at this
<pb#629/>
time, might not be removed from this place.” We have no militia to rely upon for protection, in case of danger or attack of any kind:
There has never been any organization of the Militia in this part of the Territory, though we have an excellent system of militia laws, and a numerous band of officers, appointed by the Governor. There has never been any enrolment, muster, or exercise of the inhabitants in militia Companies or regiments. The arms sent here by the General Government several years ago, for the use of the Militia have never been distributed. No steps whatever have been taken, as far as I can learn, by the Governor, who is, by law, declared to be the Commander in chief of the Militia, to carry the militia laws into effect.**
Under these circumstances, it is natural that the inhabitants Should appeal to the Government of the United States for protection.
It is probable that you have been induced to order the troops to be withdrawn from this place, by the representations made to your department by the Governor of this Territory. When the Governor's letter mentioning that these troops were of no use here, appeared in print, it excited the greatest astonishment in the minds of the people of this district. At that time the Indians were wandering all over the Country; were in a famihed state, and Continually committing depredations upon the property of the inhabitants, and threatening their lives.
Neither the Governor, nor the Secretary who acts for him, during his absence, has been in this part of the Territory, since the Sthałęer Autumn of the year 1823; and it is presumable that they are both entirely ignorant of the real State of affairs in this district. The Governor himself was absent from the Territory for upwards of a year in 1824. & 1825.
I have taken the liberty frankly and candidly to make this representation to you, in the hope that you will see the propriety of either ordering the Company, lately withdrawn from this place, to be sent back, or a full company from Some other post to be sent hither, with all possible despatch.
Until the Indians be all removed, and quietly established within the boundaries allotted to them by the late treaty, there can be no peace or security for the inhabitants of this Territory.
<pb#630/>
Two full companies of troops permanently stationed here, until this event take place, ought not, in my humble opinion, to be dispensed with.
With great respect, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your ob" Servant John RODMAN, Collector of Sº Augustine To THE HON. JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War Washington

GEO. W. WARD AND R. K. CALL, Esq.” Reg & Rec' Tallahassee. F.
GENTLEMEN, Your letter of the 15* of June * addressed to this office and that of the Receiver of the 16** of June addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury," have been received, and I am directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to inform you that the persons claiming preemptions in Florida under the late Act of Congress *
must pay for the same in Cash at the rate of $1,”ſoo per acre, at the time of making their entry for the same. This instruction is founded on the provisions of the 1st Section of the Act of 1813,” those of the Act of the 24* April 1820," making further provision for the sale of the public Lands, and the uniform practice since the passage of the Act of 1820.
The late Act refers to the Act of the 5* February 1813, as to the manner in which the right of preemption is to be established, and that
<pb#632/>
608 T E R F I TO P I A L PA P E R S Act declares, that “in every case where it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Register & Receiver, that any person, who has delivered his notice of claim is entitled according to the provisions of this Act to a preference &c" under this provision the Register and Receiver become the sole judges of the right, of the party claiming to a preemption—and they will of course take such measures, and prescribe such forms of evidence, as will satisfy their judgement as to the propriety of granting a certificate. The evidence, I should think, ought to be written, in the form of an affidavit or interrogatories, and sworn to and duly certified by an acting Justice of the Peace, and if the witnesses are not personally known to the Register & Receiver, their credibility ought to be established by the evidence of persons of known character & standing. It will be necessary to guard against fraud by every possible precaution on the part of the Officers.
The land granted as a preemption must consist of an entire legal quarter section, or fractional quarter Section, and not of two eight parts of different quarters. The provisions of the 3* Section will not vary this rule, it affects the apportionment of the quantities, to each individual. Great precaution will be necessary to guard against imposition on the government from applications under the provisions of the 3* Section. Where Settlers have sons, over 21 years of age, or overseers, attempts will be made to obtain more than one preemption, and where there are two or more separate, distinct and independent families settled on one quarter Section (which are cases intended to be provided for) they will attempt to enter distant &
more valuable Land; they should be confined to the immediate neighborhood as far as practicable, and to the particular sections into which any of their improvements may extend.
The term “legal representative” in its strict import, is a representative in law, and not by assignment. By adhering to this construction of the term, and by granting your certificates to the original claimants you will be releived from much embarrassment—if the parties wish to assign their claims after confirmation, it can be done in the usual manner and patents will issue to the assignee It is necessary to forward a list of preemptions granted specifying the tract, quantity and name of the person to whom granted It will be unnecessary to forward the evidence, which will be carefully preserved in your Office 7"

SIR, Your letter of the 9th of June " has been referred by the Secretary of the Treasury to this Office. On reference to the Act passed the 2nd day of March 1819,” to enable the people of Alabama to form a Constitution you will perceive that the original provisions of the original Act relative to the selection of lands for the use of a Seminary of Learning in Alabama were changed, and the discretionary powers of the Secretary of the Treasury enlarged. In all cases where portions less than entire Township have been selected by the Secretary of the Treasury for the use of the Seminary of Learning in any State or Territory, it has been done under an Act granting authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to select in specific quantities of less than one entire township, and I have no doubt that on application from the Governor & Council of Florida, Congress would grant to the Territory of Florida that privilege as to the selection which has been specifically granted to several of the States.”

<docbody>SIR I take the liberty of addressing you in relation to the occupation of certain rooms in Fort Marion as a county jail It will be seen by, the copies enclosed that the Marshall of the District has been directed to permit the Sheriff to occupy in common with him some part of the Fort as a jail.” This he has refused except upon conditions which cannot be compiled with by the Sheriff as I am informed by him.
As there never has been a prisoner committed in this County for any crime against the United States and it is probable there may never be it appears to have been the object of Gov' to grant this jail for county purposes. Two things will probably be recollected: formerly the Marshall had charge of the prisoners who are now in charge of the Sheriff and as a law passed by the Legislative Council of the Territory and approved by Congress prohibits the levying any tax for the purpose of erecting county jails in the counties of St Johns and Escambia it is presumable that it was intended the public buildings should be used in those Counties. The Sheriff has heretofore kept his prisoners in his own house as the house he then ocupied answered the purpose The one he at present ocupies does not and he has been lately compelled to refuse to recive prisoners delivered to him in consequence of having no safe place of keeping. These reasons induce me to request of you that directions may be given to enable the Sheriff to occupy some part of the Fort as a jail *

SIR, The Agent of the Deaf & Dumb Assylum, of Ky,” called on me yesterday to solicit my assent, to the location of the land in Florida, as represented in the plat forwarded from your office, &
to the location of such parts as should be covered by the claims of settlers on other contiguous public lands—Against both of which as the Representative of the Territory, I feel it my duty to protest—& I
am gratified to perceive that there is such a coincidence in our opinions on this subject. I do not think the Act of Congress * confers any such power on the Secretary, & in giving instructions to locate it in bodies of four sections each he has given the most liberal construction that the law will warrant, & one which if not sanctioned by the precedent in the donation to Connecticut, I should say was not warranted by the letter or spirit of the law. The idea that they could hold over the settlers was so preposterous as to require not even a passing remark. The Act granting preemptions confers a title to the spot on which the settlement was made.” The other gives a title to be located in one of the Territories, the location to be approved by the Secretary before any title to any specific land vested, & as the preemption law passed before the location & approval there was a vested right in the setlers, & I beg in their behalf most respectfully
<pb#637/>
to protest against any patent, until their claims are ascertained *—
I am now on my way to Pensacola, at which place I shall be pleased to know the decission upon the two half quarter sections of land, entered by my brother & also whether instructions have been issued to the Receiver & Register of East Florida to open an office at St Augustine— ”

<docbody>To the Honourable James Barbour, Secretary of War:
The petition of the Subscribers, resident inhabitants of the City of St. Augustine, in the Territory of Florida, respectfully Sheweth:
That your petitioners feel much aggrieved by the late removal of one of the companies of United States troops from this place;
that there now remains only one Small company, consisting, of about fifty men; that the unsettled State of the Indians in this Territory,
<pb#638/>
and Some alarming outrages and depredations, which they have recently committed in this district, have excited very Serious apprehensions, among the inhabitants, for the Safety of their lives and property; and these apprehensions are greatly increased, in consequence of the absence of the Indian Agent from this Territory.
Your petitioners beg leave further to State, that from the Scattered population of the Yeomanry of this Territory, the ordinary Militia movements are impracticable, and no reliance can be placed on this Source for Such prompt defence, as may be necessary against the ravages of the famished tribes of Indians Still remaining amongst us; and the present feeble force of the United States troops, in this quarter, is totally inadequate to prevent the incursions and violence of the Savages, and afford the necessary protection to the inhabitants.
Your petitioners therefore pray that the Company of United States troops, lately withdrawn from this place, may Speedily be returned, or that Some other Company may be Sent hither, without delay; and that for the future, at least two full companies may be kept here, until perfect tranquility and security be restored, and all the Indians be removed within the boundaries assigned to them by the late Treaty.”
And your petitioners will ever pray &c.

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a communication to Capt. Clark respecting that part of the road from Coleraine to Wanton's allotted to him to open, & of the documents therein referred to. Although I know that the ground over which
<pb#639/>
the route to Branning's ferry would pass is the highest & best; and the easiest for constructing a Road, avoiding altogether the St: Fé, a difficult Stream to Bridge permanently, & bad to pass any how when full; yet as the Route to Hagan's is so much desired by the people I have recommended it to Capt. Clark in preference to the other. The change in the route thus proposed will be but a slight deviation from that recommended to your notice, on which the last order was founded, & consists only in going to the upper ferry on Black Creek, by keeping the Road on the west side instead of the East side of the “South Prong” of Black Creek.”—

(Copy.) TALLAHASSEE, July 20° 1826.
SIR, I enclose herewith certain papers from Sundry Citizens of Florida numbered from 1 to 4 * respecting the Route for the Road from Wanton's to Black Creek. There are two routes which will come under your notice to choose between; the first to cross at Branning's & the other at Hagan's ferry; for either of which I have provided as you will see by the enclosed advertisement.” These ferries are two & a half miles apart, “Branning’s” being to the East, &
“Hagan's” to the west of where the “South prong” empties into Black Creek. The first route, (Wiz: to Branning's,) is, leading from Wanton's about eight miles up the “St. Mary's Road”, where there is a trail turns off to the right & intersects the Road opened from Pensacola to St. Augustine about nine miles eastwardly from where the said St. Mary's road crosses the said Pensacola & St. Augustine road; thence it continues on said Pensacola & St. Augustine road for a distance of about twelve miles, passing by the Scrub Hammock at the Internice ponds & Town about two miles, opposite to a large, * Answered Sept. 21, 1826, NA (WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 10), expressing approval of the change of route. See Burch to Clark, July 21, 1826, NA (WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File), printed, Boyd (ed.), “First Amer. Road in Fla.”, Fla. Hist. Quart., XIV, 175—176, enclosing copies of road contracts, including that of Dec. 21, 1824 (ante, p. 128), for his use in connection with the opening of the road in question. See post, p. 642.

616 T E R P I TO R. I. A. L. PA P E R S open, clear-water, pond where there is a trail turning up to the left hand, (north,) leading directly to Branning's Ferry, distant twenty miles, & crossing two of the branches of the “South Prong” which will require to be bridged. The Major part of this route is over high sand hills. The second route is that recommended by the citizens, Wiz:—
leading from Wanton's along the “St. Mary's road” to “Kingsley's pond”, where it turns off to the right for Hagan's ferry, distant therefrom eighteen miles. This route is through flat, wet, pine woods to Kingsley's pond; from thence it is high sand ridges. The chief obstruction in this route is bridging the St: Fé River. Both routes will be about the same in point of distance, (say a little upwards of fifty miles,) but will, I believe, be as to shortness a little in favor of going by Kingsley's pond. Both the places named for ferries possess about equal advantages, there being no swamp or marsh on either bank at either place. The Country nearest to the intended road susceptible of much improvement or settlement lies to the west of said St. Mary's Road; & in it are the Settled parts of Alachua, commencing at the St. Fé natural Bridge & extending to the Alachua Savannah, these Settlers carry their trade & purchase their supplies either at Black Creek or at St. Mary's hence the road is all-important to them, for if opened by Kingsley's pond, it will open to them a good Road to Black Creek; thence to Jacksonville on the St. John's; &
thence to St. Marys; in lieu of the difficult & precarious route they now pursue along the “St. Mary's road” over an entire wilderness &
crossing the overflowing creeks forming the head branches of St.
Mary's River. The inhabitants at and below Sanfalaski fall into the
“St. Mary's Road” by cart paths, south of where it crosses the St.
Fé; & those of Dills' Settlement to the northward of the same, by a cart path which crosses the St. Fé at a fording place lower down. No Survey of these routes is at all necessary, as the Route from Wanton's by the way of Kingsley's Pond to Hagan's ferry is a broad cart road.
And the route from Wanton's in like manner is fully designated by the nature of the Country & by the routes already open therein, as mentioned above. Flanking parties detached from the working party to select & lay off the road, on whichever route may be chosen keeping that as the general guide, will be sufficient to ensure the best selection of ground for the Road to pass over. The intermediate Country between these two Routes is altogether impracticable, being occupied by the large marshes & ponds forming the head of the St:
Fé River; by other large ponds & Marshes including the extensive ones of the Internice; & by the head branches & waters of the
“South Prong” of Black Creek which takes it rise here & has its
<pb#641/>
course running northwardly between the two routes, into Black Creek. The first named route is most assuredly the best ground for a Road & is that over which I had it always in contemplation to open it if the route by Black Creek was approved, but it will be removed to such a distance from the present population as to be out of their reach, & it will pass over a Country in which there are no Settlers &
from its nature will never possess any of consequence. Whereas the second named route, although much of it will be through a flat country
& more difficult of making a Road; yet as it will accommodate so well the entire population of that part of the country & is so much desired by them, I should not hesitate, if my opinion can be of any weight in determining your choice, to adopt it for the route of the Road. I
should have answered your letter of the 28* May asking for information respecting that part of the road allotted to your Superintendence, at an earlier date, but I had understood that the people of that section of Country would make some representations respecting it either to you or myself, & I was awaiting a knowledge of that, in order then, to to give you the fullest information in my power. I request that when you have determined at which ferry you will bring the road, Hagan's or Branning's, you will notify Mr F. J. Ross, Contractor for that Section of the Road at as early a date as possible, that he may be governed accordingly in opening the Road:—his address is at Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida.-I have enclosed to Gen' Jesup copies of this communication & of the papers therein mentioned. A copy of my letter to him is enclosed herewith.-

<docbody>Co! THOMAS L M*KENNEY Gen.' Sup' of Indian affairs SIR. The Copies of the several letters, herewith transmitted, together with an extract of a letter from the Sub Agent Oren Marsh Esq. will exhibit to the Department the temper of the Indians in this Territory "
I hesitate not to say, that some decisive step must be taken early, or the worst consequences will arise from the lawless conduct of the Indians—
These people are apprised of the kind feelings of the Government towards them,-they know minutely all their Acts in relation to the late Creek treaty—And without being able to draw the distinction
<pb#649/>
between their own Situation And that of the Creeks—they have, and do presume, that so far from meeting the punishment, they merit for their Conduct, that the Government will protect them in their COUlrSe.
Provisions have long since been transported to Tampa Bay for the Indians—the want of Subsistence Can no longer be used as a pretext for their conduct. The fact is, the best hunting ground is within their own limits, yet they will not hunt, but in our settlements, where they supply themselves with the Cattle and provisions of the Settlers I have had my house crouded with Indians for Six months, many of them when sick come to me to be taken Care of Common humanity will not permit me to drive these people away when disease is preying upon them—My private expence is not a little increased in this way.
In fact Sir, I must say that the interest of the people is suffering so much, and my trouble and responsibility so greatly increased, that it has become necessary for me to Apply again to the Department of War, and if no Change Can be ordered by the Secretary, or the President I must be content to be driven from the Office I now hold "

<docbody>SIR, In obeidence to instructions of the 9” of June " I have examined the road from the Ocholochony River to this place, I find the road generally constructed according to the contracts, as explained to me by Cap" Burch, the instructions given by him to M*
Bellamy &c.; I have pointed out to Mº Bellamy some defects, principally in the cause ways between this and the high grounds in Alachua, he immediately set his hands to work, on the west side of the St Johns River, and accompanied me to this place for hands and has returned with them to complete the work required between this place and the St Johns, so that in very few days the road will be completed, Mº Bellamy evinces a disposition to perform everything required of
<pb#650/>
him by the Contract, The nearest practicable route has been selected for the road—but it is to be regretted it passes over a very low country, which during the rainy season is covered with water in many plaeces for ten miles in extent, the water however is never so deep but that Teams can pass over it, the foundation being a firm hard sand.
in order to have a dry road at all seasons it would require sixty miles of turnpike, this does not appear to have been contemplated by the Contract in as much as it is neither miry, boggy, nor swampy;-
through this low section of Country I have been very particular in the examination, and the very heavy rains that is constantly falling at this season, enables me to judge of it correctly, and I am satisfied that no miry ground has been left, without a causeway, The Country bordering upon this section of the road is not susceptible of cultivation, consequently there is no settlements, between this and the Alachua, a distance of ninety miles, travellers for the sake of accommodation leave this road at Alachua pass by Wantons to Palatki Ferry on the St Johns even the mail travels that route at present.
The consequence is the Ferry at Picolati is not worth the attention of any responsible person, and those who do travel this route are subject to disappointment in crossing the River. how this evil is to be remedied I cannot say.—
So soon as M* Bellamy has completed the work I have directed, I
shall furnish him with the requisite certificates and return to Tampa Bay.”

SIR, A communication has been received from a citizen of Florida 10
inclosing the accompanying Newspaper essay which he asserts is a true representation of the condition of your militia—at this time the more to be regretted from the hostile appearances among the Indians—
I have felt it my duty to submit it to your particular consideration with a view to ascertain its correctness—and if true to suggest the necessity of adopting immediate steps on your part to place your militia on the most respectable footing—and furthermore how far there is actual danger to the repose of the Territory to be apprehended, and to what extent from the Indians—and what aid, is required from the United States.”

<docbody>SIR. I have just received your communication of the 13* Ulto *—
It would have contributed largely to the restoration of tranquility in this quarter, if an order for the establishment of a Military Post on the Southern border of Allachua had accompanied your instructions on the application of the appropriation for the relief of the Florida Indians—The mere presence of a force for a limited time in the neighbourhood of the Indian location would produce the most salutary effects—The depredations complained of are committed by a small party of wandering Refugees who can only be restrained by force;
and the better part of the nation would wish to See it exercised—They feel the embarrassment of their present situation & know they are unjustly held responsible for the acts of some of their men, which they
<pb#652/>
themselves, if they possessed the ability, would willingly suppress—
Give us but a small force under an active prudent officer with general instructions and I will assure a cessation of all complaints from this quarter as to Indian irregularities in less than 6 months "–

<docbody>HoNb" JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War SIR Since my letter to you of the 8” Inst.” Mr Doyle And his Interpreter (whom I had despatched to Collect the Indians near the Suwannee river, for Maj. Phagan the Sub Agent was too Sick to do this duty) have returned to this place. Mº Doyle reports that the Indians had moved off to Tampa Bay, and he Could not find one remaining—The Supplies have no doubt drawn them to their own Country If it is possible for you to order a Block house to be established at the Mouth of the Suwannee river and direct that one Company or even 25 men Should occupy it, I believe it would at once induce the Indians to remain within their limits. The Mouth of the Suwannee is their Crossing place when they Come into the Settlements West of that River—the Continuance of the force at that point will not be required longer than 18 months after their establishment, for I am Convinced the population of this part of Florida will be so numerous as to controul the Indians who may wander West of that river, after that period—
<pb#653/>
The expence of this Station will not be greater than at any other point on the Gulf, as the Same Wessel that supplies the troops at Tampa Bay Could easily transport the men and requisite Supplies to the Suwannee If it is possible for you to let me have sixty five rifles and Accoutrements for one fine Company now raised in this City, who are without arms, I believe it would promote the public Service, And tend to restrain the Indians—The Indians are remarkable for Observing any Change in the Arms of Our Militia—
This Country, from its extensive frontier is greatly exposed, And having some of the most turbulent Indians within Our limits, will induce you I trust, to accede to this reasonable request.—
If you determine to Send the Arms, they may be directed to the Care of Capt Daniel E. Burch Asst Quarter Master at Pensacola—
who will by your order have the Same delivered at St Marks by the Schooner Florida, belonging to his Department as she passes often from Pensacola by St Marks to Tampa Bay.

<docbody>SIR. Having signed the memorial addressed to you by the Inhabitants of this place,” on the subject of the Florida Canal, I feel desirous of explaining my views in relation to the route recommended; in order that I may not be supposed to have united in the representation alluded to, without that due consideration & Knowledge of the circumstances of the country, which as an old resident of the territory might be properly expected from me. I beg leave first to observe, that I am fully aware, that no entrance or port suitable for the reception of ships, has been supposed to exist on any part of the coast west of Tampa Bay;
but as the greater portion of our western sea board, has never been surveyed, I think it highly desireable that the route above referred to, should be examined, as in the event of its being found unsuitable for a Ship channel, it is, in my estimation, likely to prove the most eligible direction in which to open a canal for boat or Steam navigation.
A canal in this direction, would pass through the richest part of Florida, and would also place an inexhaustable Store of valuable naval materials, at the command of the Gov". As a ship channel however, is, I understand, the object of the Government, I take the liberty of observing, that should the rout recommended in the memorial be found unadapted to this purpose, that a canal upon the
<pb#655/>
scale desired, may, I am persuaded, beat once opened from Tampa Bay into the deepest waters of the river Sº Johns, in which direction, there would be but few obstecles to encounter, and comparatively Speaking, but a short distance to be Cut. I feel convinced that even from Sº Marys, no other than a boat channel can be formed, from the want of a proper harbour in the opposite direction on the Gulf of Mexico. Tampa Bay is the deepest point on the western Sea board of this penensula (as far as our present Knowledge extends) and may as I have before said be easily connected with the navigable waters of the Sº Johns. Wishing to be brief, and to intrude as little as possible upon your valuable time, I have the honor to Subscribe my self.”—

SIR, In your advertisement for opening the road from Coleraine to Black Creek, we observe that you have designated either of the ferries at Black Creek to cross at. It is of importance to us as inhabitants of the Country that this road should leave Wantons and continue the route along the present road from Alachua to St: Marys, crossing the Santafee at the ford, thence to Kingsleys Pond and leaving it on the left hand, cross Black Creek at the upper or Hagens ferry. This route will open a Communication for the people residing in the lower part of Alachua County to the tide water on St. Johns both at Black Creek, and to Jacksonville, by a road to be opened from Gravelly Hill, to the latter place, a distance of Six miles; moreover, such route will accomodate the inhabitants of this Section of Country generally, more than any other, in their Communications with each other;
we therefore hope that our request may prevail.

<docbody>HON: JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War, SIR I had the honor to receive your letter of the 6* instant *
with the paper printed at S* Augustine. There have been but two regimental Musters in the Territory and these have been in Jackson and Gadsden Counties, Company Musters have been common throughout the Settlements in Florida with the exception of the Counties of Escambia & Sº Johns. That the Militia is not properly organized is readily admitted, and I believe this is the fact in most of the States. It is admitted that the Officers are not equipped and it would be difficult in many parts of this Country to procure the articles required for this Object. Had a rigerous observance of the Militia law been exacted (except the Brigadier Generals who are
<pb#660/>
appointed by the President with the advice of the Senate) Not an Officer but would have resigned.
The Citizens of Florida are enterprising bold men and like the mass of our best Citzens who have emigrated to new lands and Countries do not bring, but come to acquire fortune, Not one in five hundred has yet had the opportunity to purchase the cabin he has built or the land he has opened in the forest to protect and support his family.—Nor is it probable that they would be inclined to devote their slender savings for this anxious object, to uniform themselves—Many of our citizens now go twenty and thirty Miles to Company Musters, that are unable in a large district thinly settled to attend the muster of the Regiment. Gen.' Hernandez had fifty Stand of Public arms from me he has made no report of their disposal. Gen' Call who also received the remaining fifty has divided them between two fine Companies of Volunteers which together with private arms have placed them in a Situation for service.
I have been actively engaged during the Spring and summer in trying to excite our Citizens to form themselves into Corps, There are at this time four Companies of volunteers commanded by good officers, If I had two hundred muskets, and one hundred rifles, to place in the hands of such men as belong to this Territory, we would want no aid or assistance from the United States to control the Indians in Florida, if any danger is to be apprehended it is from about two hundred lawless Indians Most of whom are the notorious Micosuka tribe, I had the honor last spring to give you this information and to assure you that Nothing short of force would control this banditti, They are the Outlaws of their own Nation and have Many of them fled from Merited punishment which awaited them at home, The great body of the Nation have long since quietly Settled on their lands, and are friendly and attentive to the advice given to them, The Nation have in Council Condemned the Indians who have Constantly been depredating on our Settlers, but these fugitives go wandring over the Territory, dealing destruction on the Cattle and rifling the plantations, I apprehend more danger is likely to arise from our own Citizens who are and have for some time been ready to redress by force of arms the wrongs and injuries they have sustained. It has required all my vigilance and influence to restrain this hostile disposition, There is no danger of the Indians resorting to arms except in self defence, they are entirely sensible of their feeble situation and dependance on the Government—Some Indians lately Murdered another on Major Woodruff's “ plantation on the S" John's River, for what cause is unknown The Indian that
<pb#661/>
was Murdered had resided some time with Maj Woodruff, I have now his application sent to demand of the Chiefs that they surrender the Murderers. And in case of Neglect or refusal it is hoped the department will empower Me to send a force into the Nation to arrest the Offenders I would respectfully reccommend that a Block house be established at or near the Mouth of the Suwannee River * which is the great Crossing place of the Indians who travel west one Company if Stationed there for 18 Months will prevent in a great Measure the Indians from depredating on the Citizens after that time the population will be so much encreased in that quarter that the force May be withdrawn.
If previous to this however a detachment of regular troops could be ordered from Pensacola or Tampa Bay to land at Fort Sº Marks and scour all the Country between that place eastward thro' Alachua County destroying all the Indian Settlements out of their limits, I
can assure you that No More Complaints will be Made of Indian depredations, The moment they find the Government determined to enforce the treaty they will at once submit. The disturbances in the Creek Nation occasioned by the death of M*Intosh and other Causes have mainly Contributed to Make a part of the Florida Indians restless, turbulent and factious at home and insolent and daring abroad **

SIR, A proper regard to the public service made it necessary to remove a company of Artillery formerly stationed at Sº Augustine.
The enclosed petition from a portion of the inhabitants of that place solicits its return, or the substitution of another on the ground of apprehended Indian hostilities.* Altho' I have long since supposed that any attempt on the part of the Indians to attack in masses our white settlement situated as is that of S*Augustine too desperate to be a just subject of alarm—yet if circumstances exist to produce a well grounded apprehension of such an event measures should be adopted to prevent it. A dispersion of troops beyond necessity is attended with inconvenience, and a detriment to discipline—with
<pb#662/>

<place-time>PoST OFFICE DEP 31* Aug 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>Mr E. B. GOULD, St Augustine Florida, I regret that any unpleasant differences have arisen out of the investigation which was lately made at your instance—From the facts which were developed by this enquiry; I have no doubt, that the miscarriage of your papers, heretofore, may in a considerably degree be attributed to the manner in which they were put up and directed. I have taken great pains to ascertain the causes of the failures of newspapers so frequently complained of, and I have ascertained facts, that justify a belief, that five out of six failures may be ascribed to this cause. The reports which have been made to me from one distributing office, will sustain this statement. -
It is remarkable, that Since I have been in the Dep", I have not rec" a Single complaint, of the failure of “Niles Register,” and this can only be accounted for, by the great care with which their paper is prepared for the mail, where newspapers are folded when damp from the press, and are only secured by a tender envelope & paste, it is unreasonable to expect, that they will be safely conveyed to the places of their destination. Strong wrapping paper and twine should be used, and the direction should not be left to the least competent person in the printing office, which is sometimes the case. If papers were prepared for the mail in this manner, there would be little or no complaint of failures. I do not wish to be understood as exculpating Post Masters from neglect in the transmission of newspapers—No doubt they are sometimes culpable and to correct this evil my duty &
inclination unite.
When P. Masters, who are sworn officers, & in many instances highly responsible, men, are charged not only with carelessness, but with the most culpable omissions of duty, which is sometimes done, and even corrupt motives ascribed to them, it is to be expected that they will become somewhat excited. Great allowance is made, and should always be made, for the feelings of a printer, who is charged
<pb#663/>
with neglect in not forwarding his papers to subscribers, when he believes his duty, in this respect, has been strictly discharged—
I am sure your motive was laudable in your late complaints, and I
hope, that the investigation which has been had will produce some good effect, and that so far, as the miscarriage of your papers have arisen from the negligence of P. Masters, there will in future be no ground for complaint. I shall ever be ready to enquire, on complaint being made, and where negligence in any office continues, after notice has been given to the P. Master, a more effectual step will be taken—
So far from cherishing any hostility against any person who complains of an evil, real or supposed, in this Dep", and asks for the remedy, I feel under obligations to such person, for enabling me to correct an irregularity, if it exist. It is a subject of regret, that this feeling does not extend, at all times, to all who are officially connected with me—
It is expected that there will be delays in transmitting documents—
they sometimes amount to many Wagon Loads & can only be forwarded when the size of the mail will admit— -
Some of the documents of last winter, are not yet printed—through the summer, they have been forwarded in the mail, in almost every direction *—

I find one the streams over which I had built an excellent Bridge has changed its course entirely, and has actually carried the bridge up the stream some distance, this is occasioned by the over flowing of the Hillsborough River, This bridge has to be replaced, and several of the Other bridges require some repairs, it will be sometime before the Waters will sub-

<place-time>PENSACOLA, October 1* 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, My accounts entire for expenditures on the Road from Pensacola to St. Augustine being now rendered and my duty in respect to it ended I enclose herewith my own accounts for transportation of baggage incurred in part on that account; and also for a per diem while necessarily employed on that duty agreeably to your letter of 29* November 1824,” numbered 1 & 2.*—Some time after I received your letter I also received one from Gov. Duval * informing me that Mº Calhoun then Secretary of War had promised I
should be allowed $.3 p" day for the whole time I was engaged on these roads in Florida; and also a letter from Gen' Call* then the
<pb#667/>
Delegate from Florida stating that it was agreed by yourself & by Mº Calhoun that I should receive the said sum of $.3 p" day for the whole time I had been & should be thereafter employed on that service. These Gentlemen had interested themselves in my favor knowing the fatigue & exposure caused by performing the duty, &
the necessity of having some allowance to meet my increased expenses, independent of giving me a just remuneration for individual labor
& services rendered not exactly in the line of my duty as Quarter Master. The transportation account includes only such journies as were made connected with the Road service separate and apart from the daily travel performed while present with the troops & elsewhere, which is altogether omitted, though very considerable if it had been taken into the account. The Per diem account, although such was the understanding at the time as stated, above, is not made for the whole time I was superintending this work, but only such periods during the time as I was actually engaged in the same. By an examination of my accounts it will be seen that of the Appropriations of $.28000 for this Road I have received from the Treasury $.27069, of which there is an unexpended Balance of $.1501.08/100, which added to the amount undrawn is $.2432.08/100. The accounts now presented for your decision amount to $.1853.58/100 leaving still, if admitted an unexpended Balance of $.578.50/100. In addition to this balance there was a considerable quantity of property transferred to the service of the Q" Mrs: Dept. in closing my accounts for the 2° Q" of 1826, of which no valuation has yet been made nor credit given therefor to the Road account. The account for transportation of baggage however properly belongs to the Q" Mrs: Dept.
to pay, because it was chiefly occasioned by my duties as Quarter Master at Pensacola & therefore should not be charged to the Road account.—
I also enclose for your decision my accounts for services performed in relation to the Road from Coleraine to Wanton's, lettered A. B.
& C.”—The first lettered A. is for the examination & survey of the Route for the Road previous to issuing the proposals for contracts for opening it. In this service I consulted the strictest economy.
By reference to my Returns of property on hand at the time in the Qr. Mrs: Dept. as well as the Road account it will be seen that I
had not a single disposable pack-horse or mule. The purchase of four mules alone would have been $600, and I could not have marched a detachment with less than twelve mules. The expenses of foraging &c. for these and of the Detachment marching to Wanton's would have exceeded the amount of the account presented for your
<pb#668/>
consideration, to say nothing of the purchase of the mules; and so soon as I should have returned to Pensacola the mules would have been no longer wanting for public service, the proof of which is the fact that I have not had to purchase either a mule or Horse since, but have had extra ones both for issue & sale. And in any event if I had gone to the expense of fitting out & marching a detachment thither I should still have required the services of some intelligent person acquainted with the country as a guide. Whereas the whole expense, in lieu of having a detachment & public means of transportation, is the charge for my private transportation of baggage;
and the charge for a per diem as was allowed to me in the former survey of a Road. The second account, lettered B., is charged for transportation of baggage while on a journey from Tallahassee to Jacksonville; & the third, lettered C., is for the per diem of $.3, while engaged on that service in the same manner as is charged for services on the Pensacola & St. Augustine Road, the interval thus employed being left out in that account. These two sums amounting to $.143.72/100 comprise the whole charge for a journey & service that merely being paid for, not $500 would have been the least inducement to me to have performed; nor could hardly any respectable man in the Country been found who would have incurred the risk of such a journey at that season of the year on any account whatever; but my orders were imperative & I was aware that obedience was my province.—
Respecting the transportation accounts I do not suppose there can be any difficulty; but in the case of the per diem in the accounts I
respectfully solicit your interest in favor of having them allowed.
And if they are allowed I am myself conscious that it will be money dearly earnt. But if my Allowances are limited to the transportation of baggage alone it will not cover my actual expenses. For the last three years I have been a Slave to these duties, connected with my regular duty as Q' Master at Pensacola; & have not allowed myself scarcely a day of recreation or for the enjoyment of society.—And in addition to my services in regard to these roads, I believe my reports
& accounts in your Office will shew that my regular duties alone as Quarter Master at Pensacola during the whole time I have been on this station have been as active & more exposing, & the disbursements as great, as those of any other officer of the Department. Such continued exposure to the wet & rain of the Winter, & the heat of the Summer sun in travelling have at length seriously impaired my health, & I now find that rest & care are absolutely necessary for its restoration. I would not again make the three several journeys across the Peninsula of Florida & afterwards returning to this place (as performed by me since May last,) incurring the same risk of fever by
<pb#669/>
exposure in an uncommonly hot Summer, for the whole amount of these accounts, transportation of baggage & per diem together.—
When the decision on these accounts is made I request that they may be returned to me in order that my accounts for the Pensacola &
St. Augustine Road may then be finally settled & closed.—
From an examination of these accounts of mine together you will perceive that I have made distinct & separate charges for the two services to each; and not blending them together by charging either a per diem or transportation for both at one & the same time, though engaged in both services at the same time.—
I also enclose for your consideration an account for a per diem while engaged in the Survey & opening the Road to Fort Mitchell.” It appears that it had an endorsement on the back of it made in your Office, but afterwards erased, from which I infer that you, at least, thought it equitable; and induces me to present it now a second time.
Indeed your letter of 29* November 1824 * authorizes me to charge transportation in lieu thereof, which however I have not yet done as I preferred again submitting the original account, & which but very little exceeds the allowance of transportation if charged.*—
I have the honor to be, Sir with perfect respect Yº Mo. Ob. Serv"

To the immediate appointment of one, there is a difficulty in respect to the compensation to be given on the part of the United States, which is made to depend on that given by Georgia to the Commissioner on her part. So soon as your Excellency will inform me of the amount of compensation given by Georgia—a Commissioner will be appointed on the part of the United States, and ordered to cooperate with yours in the running of the said line. But as it is now impracticable under these circumstances to take the field for this purpose by the first Monday in November, I have to request that the first Monday in December next, may be fixed on if agreeable to the arrangements of Georgia. *

<place-time>October 16th 1826</place-time>
<docbody>COL” ROBERT BUTLER. Tallahassee Florida SIR, I sometime since forwarded to you a copy of a bill reported at the last Session of Congress, relative to the surveying of private claims"—the principle of the bill was, that all confirmed claims, which had heretofore been actually surveyed under the Spanish
<pb#672/>
Gov" should be resurveyed at the public expense. You will much oblige me, by furnishing an estimate of the expense which the public would incur in making such resurveys in Florida, & what portion of it would be required for the year 1827. This bill not having been acted upon, your surveying for the winter of twenty seven will necessarily be very much curtailed. You have already more Township line surveyed than will be required, or which can be sectioned off for two years. You will find much embarrassment arising from surveying so many Township lines run previous to sectioning of them off, particularly if the sectioning of them is delayed for any length of time. My instructions to run off the township lines were given in consequence of the peculiar situation and extent of the private claims, and from a firm belief that an Act relative to the surveying the private claims would have been passed at the last Session of Congress. That Act having been deferred from the want of time to act upon it, it becomes necessary and proper to curtail our surveying operations until next fall, when I hope much may and will be done. The Lands, which I think it now most desirable to have surveyed, are those lying South of the St Johns River, and between that River and the Atlantic as far South as Smyrna, and as this section of the Country is principally covered by private claims, many of which have not yet been confirmed, I should think it better to suspend the contracts until the claims are finally acted upon, when the contracts can be made for the complete surveying of the Townships. The only surveying therefore which I think you would be authorized to contract for, at present for the year 1827. would be, for the sectioning of such Townships, the lines of which had been run, which are of good quality, and which were certainly known to contain no private claim, if there be any of this description between the Suwannee & the Atlantic, they should be surveyed this winter so as to bring them into market as soon as possible. If an Act pass at the ensuing Session of Congress authorizing the survey of the private claims at the public expense, it will embrace an appropriation for that purpose, and the surveying of the private claims at the public expense may commence as soon as practicable next Autumn. It would not, however, be prudent to make contracts in anticipation "

<place-time>Cantonment Clinch, FLORIDA 18* October, 1826</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Having received information during the months of July &
August last, from persons of the highest respectability residing in the interior of Florida, that parties of the Seminole Indians, were roaming through the settlements alarming the inhabitants by threatening their lives, and Committing the most lawless depredations on their stock of Cattle and Hogs, and destroying their Cornfields, and that unless protection was given, that many of them would be Compelled to leave the Country—I Considered it my duty from instructions heretofore received, to say to the Governor of Florida, in a letter dated on the 4” of August,” that if he Considered the aid of the Military necessary for the protection of the lives and property of the Citizens of the interior of Florida, that I would promptly render him such aid as was in my power, to effect this desirable object—In reply to this letter Governor Duval, writes under date of the 19* September,”
which letter I received on Yesterday, ahd Confirming the reports before alluded to, and requests the aid of Two Companies or such number of the United States Troops, as I may from my knowledge of the Indians and the situation of the Country, Consider necessary to enable him to Compell those lawless Indians to return to their Nation—But in as much as the alarm of the inhabitants have in some Measure subsided, I have thought it most proper to inform the General in Chief, of the Course I had proposed taking, to aid in the protection of those settlements—and after submitting to him my views as to the Course best Calculated to effect this desirable Object, to await his Orders, before I proceed any farther in the business—
Such is the peculiar situation of the interior of Florida, owing to a variety of Causes, that it will be some time before the settlements will be sufficiently Strong, to protect themselves from the depredations of those wandering and lawless parties of Indians, unless they are Compelled to remain within their own limits—To effect this object, I would strongly but respectfully urge the necessity and importance, of having one Company of Troops Ordered to Tallahassee, subject to the instruction of the Governor, there to be joined by a Confidential Chief and twenty or thirty Active young Warriors, selected from the Towns on the Appalachicola, to Scour the whole Country, between Tallahassee and the Seminole Agency, Compelling every Indian to return within their prescribed limits—after the performance of which duty, to have the Company stationed at some
<pb#675/>
healthy Site, within a striking distance of the Agency for the Seminole Indians—This would not only give Confidence to the present Settlers and induce hundreds of others to Come into the Country—but would enable the Agent to Controul and keep in Check the whole of the nation,-As all experience goes to prove, that the appearance of a Military force, has more influence on the minds of the Indians than all the Talks that are held with, or the presents that are given to them—The expence attending this movement would be small in Comparison to the protection given, and the good that would result from it to the Territory—The Troops could be landed at S* Marks at very little or no expence to the Government, and from thence, there is an excellent road to the Agency—I am also induced to believe that the expence of Supplying the Troops Stationed near the Agency would not be any thing like as great, as has generally been imagined, as the River Ocklawaha, runs within a short distance of the Agency, and is said to be navigable for large boats or Schooners—Governor Duval, informs me, that he has written to the Honorable Secretary of war, on this subject,” and as I know that he feels the deepest interest in the prosperity of Florida, and that his information is much more Correct and extensive than mine—I Consider any further remarks on my part, entirely unnecessary *—

will, of course, be complied with, without a moment's unnecessary delay. But I, at the same time feel it my duty to state, that I am fearful that the position selected for the military site, is too remote from the main body of Indians to have the desired effect.—As it must be at least one hundred miles from the Agency, and will still leave all that section of Country lying between the Suwannee, S'
Mary's, and Sº John's, exposed to their lawless depredations.—
The Settlements in the largest part of this section of Country, are sparce, and the inhabitants less able than those of almost any other part of Florida, to protect themselves, as many of them rely entirely on their stock for the support of their families.
The establishment of a small military post near the Seminole Agency, would not only give protection to this section of Country, but it would also prevent the Indians from Crossing the Sº John's and harassing the settlements of some of the most respectable planters in Florida. It would also give equal protection to the settlements west of the Suwannee river, as the Commanding Officer could Co-operate with the Agent, with much greater effect, when near him, than he could at a distance of one hundred miles "–

<docbody>GENERAL, I enclose herewith a paper of this place containing a notice of the Road opened by Mº Bellamy under my direction which I request you will do me the favor to read, and also to shew it to the Secretary of War because it relates to the subject of M" Rodman's letter to him.”—I will remark that Mr Rodman's complaint was made near four months before the Road was completed, & that this notice of it is made upwards of two months afterwards, & near two
<pb#677/>
months after the work was finally accepted by Capt. Clark, when public opinion may be supposed to have passed sentence on the work & awarded either merit or blame to those concerned.—
Since my arrival here I have learned from Gov" Duval that an order had issued for the establishment of a Military Post, consisting of one Company, on the Suwannee River; and also that he had made a previous Requisition on the Commanding Officer at Pensacola for two Companies to repair to Tallahassee, scour the Country, & compel the wandering Indians to leave the Settlements & go within their boundaries. This last had been anticipated by Colonel Clinch on account of the difficulties which had arisen from their constant depredations; and I may now daily expect from him orders to provide the necessary transportation, after landing at St. Marks, for them while marching through the Country; which, being on the Spot where it will be required, I can effect with promptitude.
For this transportation, and the calls which will be made upon me for materials & funds necessary in establishing the contemplated Post, I shall require a remittance on that account of six thousand dollars. This Post, like that of Tampa Bay, will necessarily draw its supplies of all kinds & of money, from my Office in Pensacola.”—

<docbody>DEAR SIR I received yours ef respecting a box of blank book &
forms intended for the register & receivers office at this place "
The box was taken from aboard the vessel bringing it to St Augustine by Mr Wm. Levingston of this place who claimed salvage on it.
The grounds of the claim of Salvage were as follows. The vessel in consequence of her captains attempting to enter the port of St Augustine without a pilot was run a ground on a shallow part of the bar &
was there in danger of being knocked to pieces by the risings &
<pb#678/>
subsidencies of the waves of a heavy sea. During this time she required lightening & among other things this box was taken from aboard her & brought up to St Augustine M* Levingston said had it not been brought away it wa have been thrown overboard. Under these circumstances M. Downing & Myself he having since arrived here thought it better to undertake for the United States to submit to an arbitration than to have the box libel'd & incur the consequent costs. It was refered to Waters Smith Esqr United States Marshal for this district to value the box & fix the rate of Salvage. He did so & valued the box at $230 & rated the Salvage a 12% per cent. which was allow by other arbitrators for Saving Salvage on the property of individuals for the salvage on the box this aheh salvage amounting to about $28.00 we have drawn in favor of M* Levingston on the treasurer of the U States. Please call on him & explain the circumstance. The owners of property aboard the vessel submitted to an ascertained average loss of 282/3 average loss on property aboard her.
To this we have not been called on for any contribution. In consequence of the non-delivery by the capt" of the box I declined paying the freight from Charleston here amounting to $2. but as he lost considerably if I see him again I believe I will pay it *

Nothing is more certain, than that the very knowledge on the part of the Indians that such a resource was provided would so act upon their exertions to which necessity might prompt them as to relax even these, and induce them to throw the entire burden of their wants upon the Government; and when these twenty thousand Dollars, should be expended, they would be not a whit better off, than they were at the time the provision was made.
<pb#681/>
It is, therefore, made your special duty, so to apply those means, as to obviate such a consequence. The Indians should be thrown upon their own resources; and even permitted to feel that their own labor was essential to their living—and then, and when this should be found inadequate to supply their necessities, timely, and cautious aid should be given them; but even then, in such manner as not to lead them to expect its recurrence.
As those Indians have subsisted thus long without this aid, it is hoped they have learned how to take care of themselves; and that, but little, if any more of the appropriation will be required, except on the failure of their crops, or some unlooked for emergency. The balance of the provision made by a resort to the Contingency of the Indian Department of the 2000, and 5000$, it is deemed not necessary, for the present, further to touch, especially as the fund is so low, as, to be scarcely able to bear the customary drafts upon it; and it is hoped that no more may be needed from the appropriation made by Congress. Of this however, you will be better able to judge, as the condition of the Indians and their wants shall be from time to time, make known to you. Whenever, therefore, it shall be necessary to resort to the provision of the Government, it will afforded out of that made by the Congress.
I need not tell you that Humanity to the Indians requires it of the Government, no less to throw them upon their own resources, than to feed them and keep them from starving when these shall prove inadequate.
You will consider, therefore, the remaining Sixteen, (after deducting therefrom the amount drawn for on account of the 2000, and 5000, $)
out of the Twenty thousand Dollars, provided by Congress,” to be all that is now applicable to the supply of the wants of the Indians;
and this only in the way that has been stated.
To obviate the inconvenience of drawing, as you have stated them to be so great, the Secretary directs me to inform you that he will request it of the Treasury, in the future, to remit upon his requisitions.
You will therefore, in the future, give timely advice of the sum, or sums, needed by you, stating the object, or objects for which they may be required, when remittances, if in the power of the Treasury, to make them, at the points where the funds may be required, will be made.”
I have &c. &c. THO: L. MºRENNEY.

<source>[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[November 6, 1826)</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable Senate & House of Representatives in Congress assembled.
The undersigned, inhabitants of the western judicial district of Florida, most respectfully represent, that the nearest land office is at Tallahassee, distant from most of us two hundred & thirty miles, entirely removed from the ordinary business of the inhabitants of this district, and separated from us by an uninhabited wilderness;
and hence it becomes onerous and oppressive for the people of this District to make journies so long and difficult, for the purpose of attending sales, entering lands, or securing pre-emption rights, which the bounty of Congress has conferred on many of your petitioners.
That the construction, which the Register & Receiver at Tallahassee have given to the act of Congress, granting pre-emption rights to the citizens of this Territory; to wit; that all those, entitled to pre-emption should enter & pay for their lands before the first day of January next, however remote their claims may be situated from the lands then offered for sale, we consider contrary to the spirit meaning of the act, & as tantamount to a denial of the bounty intended by congress. For many are unable yet to comply with the conditions, and if all are called upon to pay for their pre-emptions at the same period, the circulating medium of the Territory is insufficient to meet the occasion, & the purchases, that the citizens will otherwise make.
Besides in the Western District the surveys are yet incomplite, & it is impossible for all those entitled to pre-emption rights to designate their claims in the manner contemplated by the act of congress. We pray, that your Honourable bodies, would establish by law another land office at Pensacola, which shall embrace the business arising in the western judicial district. This point will better accommodate the people of the district than any other, as they resort there for a market for their produce, & for the purchase of their supplies.
Nor will another office be equal to the ratio established in other places. In Alabama there are five land offices, while in Florida there are but two, & yet the latter has more square miles of territory than the former. It is, we concieve, essential to the rights of the citizens of this district, that a land office be established at Pensacola, and, that a time certain should be fixed for those entitled to pre-emption to make entry & payment for their lands.” And will ever pray &c.

<docbody>Co! THO" LM"KENNEY Gen.' Sup' of Indian Affairs SIR A Company of the United States Infantry under the command of Capt F L Dade have gone on to the Suwannee to establish a military Post." It will be some time before the Commanding Officer will be able to Select a Cite for the Post and obtain the necessary Supplies. Col Clinch believes and has so informed the war Department that the Post should be established near the Agency, this was what I always desired and would have greatly prefered. If the Secretary would be pleased to modify the Order So as to permit Co! Clinch to Select the most eligible point for the Post that would enable the Commanding Officer to Controul the lawless Indians it seems to me much good would result from it—near the Agency water transportation may be had to Supply the Post.
I directed Maj. Phagan last Summer to take up his residence in the vecinity of the Apalachicola Indians,—this was necessary owing to a sett of white men who reside near the Indians, whose lawless conduct has hitherto annoyed and injured the Phdiahs them—the Sub Agents presence was required to protect them and their property from these men—no legal proof could be procured of their stealing the horses cattle and hogs of the Indians but I had no doubt of the fact.
<pb#686/>
Maj Phagan by my order put up a Cabbin near the Centre of the Indian population And since then, no disturbance or injury has taken place–In doing this I was aware that it would be attended with Some expence but the object required me to meet it—the house or Cabbin may cost $140 but not more And Serves also for a Store house for provisions &" I hope this may meet your Approbation 7–

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE 10* Nov 1826</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. The enclosed copies of Judicial decissions of the Superior Court of this District,” will inform you of Some of the difficulties the Register and myself have encountered in carrying in to effect the law granting pre-emptive rights in Florida.”
The claim of Gov" Duval (which you will find among the decissions)
is for one of the quarter Sections reserved from Sale by the Register and Receiver for the use of the Town of Tallahassee, under the authority given them in your letter of March 1825.” The pre-emption law only excludes from entry such land as had been previously reserved from Sale by former Acts of Congress. But as this reservation had been made by the department for the Special use and benefit of Tallahassee, and as it was never intended for the use of any individual. The Register and receiver were unwilling to allow the entry.
This decission of the court you will percieve is against us, but we have appealed from that decission; confident as we are that it was never the intention of Congress to grant this land to any individual.”
In an other case you will discover that the Court has given a different construction to the terms legal representative, than that intimated in your instructions to the Register and Receiver. Under this decission we are now acting and with less embarrassment, than I at first apprehended. The words “inhabited and cultivated” as expressed in the law, have also been greatly enlarged in their Signification by the decission of the Court. The Register and Receiver had construed them to mean a fixed residence, and an actual tilling of the Soil, Sowing reaping, &c. But the Court has been much more liberal, and perhaps more correct. We have already had many cases of mandamus, under this law and shall probably have many more before its expiration We are extremely desireous of being informed how far we shall be justifiable in pursuing the instructions of the department in opposition to the decissions of the Court. At present we have acquiessed in the decission, until further advices can be further advised by the Department.”

<place-time>Indian Office TALLAHASSEE November 30th 1826</place-time>
<docbody>Co! THOMAS L M*KENNEY Gen.' Super" of Indian Affairs SIR I had the honor by the last mail to receive your letter of the
6* Inst: “The $2000 and the $5000 which you suppose is unexpended except so far as the drafts have been paid was actually laid out, a part in last February and the residue in May in the purchase of provisions for the Indians and the same as you will see from the returns of Oren Marsh the Sub Agent was long since issued to the Indians.
My letter of the 8” day of August 1826.” to the Secretary of War will Shew that I sent Maj Phagan with the drafts to New Orleans to purchase provisions, and that he failed in getting them negociated.
You are requested to read the whole letter of which the enclosed is an extract.
I had visited the Indians last winter and Spring at their Towns, and immediately sent the Sub Agent on my return here to New Orleans as Stated to procure provisions. The extreme wants of the Indians required this should be done promptly, and at the time there was no other fund at my disposal than the $2000 and $5000. I am therefore personally responsible for the money thus expended and have been injured by not receiving it in due time.
The drouth last summer which destroyed the crops in North and South Carolina and Georgia, entirely ruined the crops of Corn &
Potatoes from Alachua to Tampa Bay And although when I saw them last Spring they were very promising, the Indians are more destitute than ever. The white inhabitants must, with all their care, and industry Suffer for provisions until their next Crop.
<pb#696/>
The letter of the Secretary dated 13° of July last “was immediately acted upon. The Chiefs of the nations were assembled and distinctly informed that no rations should issue to the Indians who did not permanently reside within their boundary. Under the instructions received, the Indians expect to receive Corn and Salt, and in fact they cannot exist without it. They are now Apprised that after the present sum of $20,000 is expended that they are not to receive and must not expect another supply of provisions from the Government I have long entertained the opinion you have expressed that these people should be thrown on their own resourses. And if their crops had not wholely failed I should not have expended a dollar of the
$20,000 Appropriated until I had Orders to do so. Under all the Circumstances I must advise that the whole amount be furnished as early as possible to the Indians—the Corn will not reach Tampa Bay until it is almost time to plant as I shall not order a further Supply until I hear from you, although I am Confident the Indians will suffer before that time. I have incurred much and heavy responsibility in making purchases without funds in hand, and will in future under no state of things ever place myself in a Similar Situation My great anxiety to meet the views of the Department and to act promptly has had the effect to involve me in trouble, it does seem to me, that my efforts to serve my country, and their Consequent responsibility, will ruin me, unless I am seconded promptly by your Department You have before this received the returns of the Sub Agent Mº
Marsh of the issues that have been made during the present year to the Indians these issues are considerable and the only bill I have drawn on the Department for the whole purchases, was the one in favor of Mr Braden and lately of $6525 Doll" in favor of M Crupper ‘’
for corn and Salt. long since delivered and issued to the Indians. If I had not provided for the wants of the Indians at the time I did the whole country would have been over run by them, for a starving people cannot be controuled even by force.
I have acted throughout with a steady view to economy and the interest of the country, and shall regret sincerely if the Secretary should be dissatisfied.
I am anxious to surrender my Situation as Superintendant and request you will solicit Mº Barbour to get a bill passed giving the entire controul and management of the Indians to the Agent. My duties as Governor are too much interfered with by the business of

the Indian Department—I will send on to the Secretary my petition to Congress to this effect if he will be pleased to aid me with his influence I have always been brought in debt by my Superintendancy And never have made a dollar except when he gave me an allowance for my extra Services *

The petition of Robert Butler of the Territory of Florida respectfully represents, that in the month of December 1824. he purchased an improvement on which there were suitable buildings for his immediate purposes paying therefor the sum of Two hundred & sixty Dollars as p" Document A. For the reception of his family additional improvements were made at great expence and a Grist Mill erected (and nearly completed) at the solicitation of many of the respectable inhabitants of the Town and vicinity—These improvements became located by the Surveys of the Public Lands in the North East quarter of Section one, Township 1, Range 1, South &

A Motion for a Writ of Mandamus
[C] (October 14, 1826)
In the Matter of Robert Butler, on a Matter Writ of Mandamus.
This is a Motion for a Peremptory Mandamus; to be directed to the Register and Receiver of the Land Office, Commanding them to admit the entry of a Certain tract of land, described in the proceedings, on an alledged préemptive right.
By an Act of the Congress of the United States, the Executive of Florida was authorised to Select three quarter Sections, adjacent to that assigned for the Metropolis; of which a reservation was made.
In pursuance of this Act a reservation was duly made, Comprehending the land in question.
By the Act granting the préemptive rights of Florida; reference is made to another Act, granting préemptive rights in another quarter.
According to my Construction of the two acts taken together, the latter is to be Considered in the same light as if it had been re-enacted, in the same words, in the former; with the necessary explanatieńs exceptions of geographical identificationtieh and of time.
The latter expressly excludes public reservations from the right of prêemption.
It is therefore, the Opinion and Judgement of the Court, that the present applicant Cannot sustain a legitimate right of préemption to the land in question, and that the motion for the Mandamus must, Consequently be overruled.
The Meritoriousness of the Claim being equal to, if not transcending, that of others, the peculiar hardship of the Case is perfectly obvious;
but a remedy can only be sought in a prompt resort to the legislative power, whose liberality and Sense of intrinsic justice have held seldom been appealed to in vain, and, among the enactments of which, precedents, granting relief in similar Cases are to be found.

<source>[LC:Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser, Jan. 5, 1827 *]</source>
<place-time>Washington, Dec. 5th, 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR-I understand that the Register and Receiver of the Land Office in the Western District of Florida, entertain an opinion that no claim can be presented, under the act granting the right of preemption to the purchase of lands, in that Territory, approved 22nd of April 1826,” after the first Monday in January next. This opinion I learn, from a letter addressed to me by the Register, is founded on a construction of that act, and the one passed for Illinois Territory,”
which has been made the basis of our law. The introduction of an act, framed in reference to the local condition of another country, upon the organization of land offices somewhat different, it was foreseen would produce some confusion, and might admit by its ambiguous phraseology of a variety of interpretations, and I should have been pleased to avoid any reference to that law; it was deemed proper by some of the friends of the bill, however, to incorporate that law, with a view of availing ourselves of the benefit, of the precedent established by Congress for Illinois Territory. If therefore, there were contradictory provisions, or the context should be considered doubtful, a reference to the well settled rule of construction, the intention of Congress, would reconcile these discrepancies. In my humble judgment, however, the law does not, either from the context or the
<pb#705/>
intention of Congress, as it may be collected from the whole act, warrant such a construction. The act for Illinois, requires that claims shall be presented two weeks before the “commencement of the public sales in the district wherein the land lies.” It is evident that the “commencement” here spoken of, is of each public sale of that portion proclaimed, and not of the first public sale in the District, and if that was the law in Illinois, it is entirely inapplicable to Florida, as the “public sales” in that District had commenced in May preceding the passage of the law; besides, in another part of the Illinois act, it is required that the quarter section shall be designated in the notice. It is impossible that this requisition could be complied with, when the public lands were not surveyed, and it must be apparent that such was not the intention of Congress, as that body had at the same session appropriated $24000, for the continuation of the surveys in Florida,” and any rule that would exclude those who could not present their claims, from these considerations, would be repugnant to the spirit of the law, and would render the intention of it, inoperative, so far as it affects the interest of a large portion of the people of that Territory.
Besides, in a subsequent section of the same act, the claimants in Mississippi and Alabama, who had exhibited their proofs several years before, and whose claims were reported upon by Commissioners, are given two years to enter them. It could never have been intended, that the people in Florida should designate sections and quarter sections, where there had been no surveys—procure proof, and take out their titles in the short space of a few months. The law can only mean to require, according to this view of it, the claimants within the District proclaimed for sale, to file their notices two weeks before the commencement of that sale, and in this opinion I am confirmed by the Committee who reported the bill. If you should concur in this view of the subject, I have to request that instructions may be issued to those officers accordingly, and if not, I must make an application to Congress for an amendment of the law. I beg leave to request as early an answer as may be convenient to you.
I am with great respect, Your Obe’t. Servant.

“The enclosed papers are submitted for the information and decision of the Secretary. The Lands adjacent to the Town of Tallahassee, were reserved from the first public Sale of Lands in Florida, on the suggestion of the Representation from the Territory, and on the ground that the quantity of Land granted by Congress for the purpose of establishing the Seat of Gov" was less than that which had been granted in other similar cases and that application would be made to Congress to appropriate the Lands thus reserved to the use of the Territory. Such application if made had not been acted upon by Congress at the date of the Act granting the right of Preemption.” "

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Off: Ind: Affairs, 7. December, 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Governor of Florida.
SIR, I have had the honor of receiving your letter of the 8** and three of the 9” Ultimo."
The Secretary authorizes you, in addition to the rations, to make an economical present, to the Indians who may have served under
<pb#707/>
Capt. Dade.” It may serve to attach them to us; whilst the service may shew them the objects and purpose of the Government. I
accompany this also, with five Medals for the five Apalachicola Chiefs, to be given to them in token of the friendship of their Great Father, and accompanied by such remarks in reference to the obligation which this mark of distinction confers upon them, to be firm in their friendship and sober and upright in their conduct towards the Government and Citizens of the United States.
The orders to Col” Clinch have been so modified in regard to the location of a site as to authorize him to fix it in his discretion. The Secretary approves the location of Majº Phagan; the cost of building his Cabin, (1403) will be allowed when it appears in your accounts.
In refering Major Coffee to you for the direction and termination of the lines of the survey he was directed to make, the Department was governed by your knowledge of the Country, and besides, it had no instructions to give; You were informed of the object of the executive which is to give the necessary extension of limits to the Indians; and these, as you had been appointed to examine the Country, it was reasonable to suppose you could best fix; and especially so as to avoid coming in contact, as far as possible, with the settlements of the Whites. One of your three letters before me of the 9” bears out this inference—for you say, you understood when the Chiefs were at Washington that a promise was made them that their line should run to a place called Wetomkee, and then say, this is not necessary, and besides, it will take in some valuable lands settled by Individuals.
Now this was precisely what the Department wished to avoid in refering Major Coffee to you. It was not intended to give more lands than should be necessary in this extension; nor, if that could be avoided, to interfere with lands settled by Individuals. To whom could the subject then be referr'd so well as to yourself? You will therefore direct Maj' Coffee upon such a basis—That is give the Indians a sufficiency, and avoid as far as possible embracing the lands settled by Individuals—You are referr'd to my letter of 22*
May last; * and which was as specific as it was possible to make it.
In regard to the promise made the Indians when here, that their line should run to Wetomkee, I have to state that this, is believed to be the first time I have heard that name in reference to this subject.”
<pb#708/>
The abstracts of rations have been received and transmitted to the Auditor.
The Department cannot increase the compensation to Sub-agents.
The law fixes it at five hundred Dollars. See Wol: Indian Treaties, page 394-5–1* Sec. Act of Congress of 20° Ap' 1820.* Besides, the sum is specified, always in their letter of appointment. It is to be regretted that you had not informed yourself on this subject—as on refering to the 3” Sec. of the same act you will see it is required to deduct all rations or other allowances made to them from the sum allowed for their Salary.
Neither is it possible for any further remittances to be made until your returns are received, and settlement made on the books of the Treasury. This, I entreat you not to interpret into any implication of integrity.—Every confidence is felt in you on that score—but the regulations of the Department demand it."
I have &c. &c.

SIR After the date of my letter & Communication of the 6*

<pb#710/>
most Shocking Character on the West Side of the Oscilla River.—One white man four children & one Negro. were the victims and the house burnt to ashes.
From Circumstances of recent origin an opinion exists that the discontented Creek Indians together with the Indians formerly of Mickasuky have lately been Communicating freely. and have threatened to destroy our Citizens and lay waste the Country. This Outrage is the forerunner of some Desperate Movement of these restless beings of both Nations. I have given Orders for the immediate assemblage of the force of Alachua and the adjoining Counties for the protection of that Section bordering on the Indian reservation, Capt. Dade has been instructed to fall back on the Oscilla; " And as it is of the utmost importance that the North Section of Middle Florida should be ocupied with a view of intercepting any force that might from the Creek Nation attempt to form a junction with the Seminoles,” I require that you shełłłd detach at least three Companys from your Command and that the same be despached to this point with all possible expedition In making this request on you Sir I have not perhaps such authority from the general Government as you would Consider obligatory on you. But as the Executive Officer of this Territory having the Charge of the Welfare of its Citizens who belong to the great family of the Nation, I make this appeal to you claiming all and every responsibility arrising out of it.”

That Congress at its last session with great liberality, and a just regard for the interest of our Territory, extended and granted a right of preemption to the early settlers of the Territory,” with provisions however that the same be complied with, and perfected at the Land Office, two weeks previous to the land sales, which take place on the third Monday in January next, at Tallahassee.
Of these inestimable previleges, thus granted by the generosity of Congress, the citizens of this Territory are about to be deprived.
The present Indian hostilities having called them from their homes, and compelled them to take up arms in the defence of their country.
The receiver of public monies, whose duty it is to receive and grant those preemption claims, is now at their head aiding in suppressing the incursions of the savage foe, and endeavouring to afford protection and safety to our frontier settlements.--From these facts the President will readily perceive that the citizens of Florida cannot avail themselves of the privilege of pre-emption previous to the day appointed by his proclamation for the sale of lands in this District;
and that the same will be lost to them unless he will postpone the land sales to some future period; Which your Memorialists in the name of the people respectfully request may be done.
Your memorialists can state with certainty that not more than one third of the pre-emption claims alluded to, have been adjudicated upon, and the probablity is that the receiver of public monies, as
<pb#714/>
well as the pre-emption claimants will be employed in the protection of the country during the whole time which is allowed by the proclamation for their adjudication and settlement.
Your memorialists would further represent, that in their opinion under the present disturbed situation of the country, the land sales would prove prejudicial to the interests of the general government, as their can be no doubt but what purchasers would be prevented from attending the sales in consequence of the present Indian disturbances That under any circumstances, your memorialists are of opinion that a potponement of the Land sales at this time, would prove highly beneficial to the interests of the Territory, as well as the general government, as the lands in this Territory are daily increasing in value Your memorialists earnestly hope and respectfully request, that the attention of the President may be drawn to this subject immediately; as there is scarcely time for the information of the postponement in the event of that favour being granted to us, to reach Tallahassee previous to the day fixed on for the sale above mentioned All of which is respectfully submitted Resolved, That the above memorial be received, and that the Governor of the Territory be authorised to employ some suitable person to carry this memorial to the City of Washington; and deliver the same to the Delegate in Congress; And if possible to bring with him the determination of the President upon the subject of the memorial; And that the expence of the same, be paid out of the Treasury of this Territory " -

<docbody>SIR, I understood from you the other day in a conversation I had the honor to have with you, that a discretionary power had been given to Col Clinch of the 4* Regt Infantry, to place the new military post about to be established for the protection of the inhabitants of Florida, in such a position as would be calculated to effect that object, I learn from the Adjutant General, that the order to which you refered, had not reached his office, from which I am induced to believe, there has been some mistake, unless it was issued directly, from your department to that officer—The post where it is now established is of no sort of use in protecting the inhabitants, from the depredations of the Indians, or restraining them within their boundaries—It is established 120 miles from their Northern limit, leaving the whole country between Swanee, & St Johns, &
over the latter, exposed to the Indians—I shall shortly send an appli-

cation to your Department for the losses already sustained by the Inhabitants from the Indians, & I now have the honor to enclose the petition of a number of planters in East Florida,” in relation to them and the presentment of the Grand Jury of East Florida, from from which some idea may be formed of the injuries & outrages committed by the Indians on our population. A reference to the map will at once demonstrate the impolicy of the establishment of the post at Swanee—It should be on the Southern Extremity of Alachua, or the St Johns, to give protection to the large, & increasing Settlement in Alachua County—
I saw at St Marys large, & expensive sugar works, lately purchased to be carried to Alachua, but which are delayed by an apprehension of the Indians, & the annoyance they continue to offer to the inhabitants—I have to request that the order may be issued to Col Clinch as early as possible, if it has not yet been dispatched, & such other measures as will quiet the apprehensions of the people, & encourage, rather than retard, the population of the Country—
I have the honor to very respectfully yr obt servant JOS. M. WHITE

[Enclosure:DS)
Petition to the President by Citizens of East Florida
(October 1826)
To the President of the United States The undersigned, planters and citizens of that portion of East Florida laying South of St Augustine beg leave to represent, That relying on the Security expected to be derived from the Indian treaty of Camp Moultrie of 1822,” in the removal of the Indians to a place of concentration; we embarked our means in the
<pb#717/>
F L OF I D A T E E R IT OF Y 693
cultivation of Cotton, Sugar cane and of provisions and other staples of this Country.”
That instead of enjoying this security, we have been wofully disappointed in finding the Indians, to this day, spread over the Country, in the same manner as if no treaty had existed; and in the consequences resulting from their roving habits. We are subjected frequently and almost daily to the losses and alarms incident to burning the woods, killing our cattle and hogs, stealing our corn, potatoes and other provisions, and incessant intrusion on our farms:
and we regret also that in stating these grievances we should have to add, that the Indian Agent is absent from the Territory.
Your memorialists are impressed with the belief that the white people generally of East Florida, have borne the vexations of which we complain, with a forbearance which cannot be considered by the Administration in any other light than as highly creditable to them:
yet when we reflect that repeated collision is apt kindle into irritation, and that the encroachments of the Indians cannot fail to lead to such a result: we beg leave most earnestly to urge on the attention of Administration the fatal consequences to which an excitement of this sort may lead. and we ask that these consequences may be averted, and that our persons and property may be secured, by the entire removal of the Indians from Florida, or by such other measures as the Administration may have it in its power to adopt.

<place-time>WASHINGTON CITY, December 20th 1826.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose for your information a Chart of the Mouth of Suwannee River in Florida taken by Capt. Baker of the Transport Florida.” In November last he had been ordered thither to transport a Detachment of Troops from Pensacola intended to occupy a Station on that River, but in consequence of the Shoals was unable to get the vessel in. The Detachment then returned in her to St. Marks from whence they Marched to the Suwannee Ferry, a distance of nearly a hundred miles. This ferry is upwards of a hundred miles by the course of the River above the Suwannee Old Towns, which are about forty five miles above the Mouth of the River, & are also the position it is expected the Troops will occupy, being the principal crossing place for the Indians when entering the Settlements West of the Suwannee River. To transport supplies for this detachment, first by land to the Suwannee ferry, & then by the River to the Post, will be attended with difficulty, delay, & great expense, & the entrance to the River by Sea is barred by its numerous Shoals, so as to render it unavailable by that Route for transportation.—If I may be permitted the expression of an opinion it is that this Post, if established, cannot have the desired effect of restraining the Indians. It will be about eighty miles from the Indian Country, & not in the vicinity of any white Settlements. It would prevent the entrance of the Indians by that particular route only into the Settlements West of the Suwannee; but will afford no protection whatever to the Settlements East of the Suwannee.—From a personal knowledge of the place too I am confident it will prove to be very unhealthy on account of the Ponds & extensive Swamps near to it. A position at or near the Indian agency would be more healthy, have the full effect of restraining the Indians within their limits, & could be more cheaply
& easily supplied, even if the Supplies were carted there from Tampa Bay.—
I am Sir with perfect respect Y. Mo. Ob. Serv"

and that the State of Alabama will adopt the Same measure over the Creek Indians residing within her boundary.
It Seems to me certain that if this policy is pursued, Florida will become the theatre of war, and that a Strong Military force Should be ordered into this Territory for the its protection in this event. The Department will no doubt be apprised of the proceedings of the Legislatures of Georgia and Alabama, and will promptly afford the most ample protection to our Citizens I have ordered out Several Companies of Militia who are now in Service—a number of Indians have been Sent to their own Country South—and but one Indian has been Killed Since I last wrote to you.
This Indian was one of the party Concerned in the murder of M*
Carrs family, in his pack was found Some of the Clothes that belonged to the family—I have not yet heard from the Agency, nor from Co" Brooke. Commanding at Tampa Bay—As Soon as the disposition of the Siminole Nation is ascertained & Communicated to me, Your department Shall be informed.
Some provision Should be made for the Support of the Militia who now are, and may in futher future be ordered into Service—
Thus far but little expence has been incured, Some Corn, provisions and Amunition was purchased and distributed by my order, the whole it is believed will not exceed $800 or 1.000 dollars.”

SIR Herewith enclosed I have the honour to forward a copy of the Register of receipts issued to purchasers of public Land at private Sale during the month of Nov 1826, together with a duplicate of my account current with the United States for the same period.”
<pb#722/>
I have found it impracticable with any degree of accuracy to comply with that part of your instructions which requires me to include the Sales of Land under the pre-emption Law in the same return with other Sales. It frequently occurs that after an entry is made, though supported by the Strongest testimony, that the claim is impeached and Shown to be fraudulent. Many of the claims acted on during the last month are impeached, or contested by other claimants who are now engaged in procuring testimony to Shew the incorrectness of the claims which we have approved, and to establish their own right
[to] the Same land. Until these claims Shall have been Settled I have thought it best to retain the papers, and inform you only of the amount received under the pre-emption Law during the last month, which is ten thousand ninety one dollars twenty nine cents. It is already ascertained that a part of this Sum has been received on fraudulent claims, and it will be my duty to refund the amount to the claimants in these cases and take back my receipts Under the pre-emption Law you will percieve Sir, that the Register and Receiver have no power to Summon witnesses in behalf of the United States, in consequence of which they are frequently imposed on by interested and dishonest witnesses, who establish all that the law requires to be proven when the claimant in reality has not the Shadow of right. Unless the land Sales are postponed the office will close against the pre-emptioners after the first monday in next month, immediately after which all the cases arising under that Law will be reported to the department. Some of the pre emption cases reported in my last return have lately been impeached and I have to request that the patents in all cases arising under this law may be suspended until the office is finally closed I have the honour to be Very Respectfully your Ob' Sº

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF KEY WEST</dochead>
<source>[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[December 29, 1826)</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled—
The Memorial of sundry Inhabitants of Key West, and Persons engaged in wrecking and fishing on the Coast of Florida, most respectfully represent:
<pb#724/>
That Key West is situated immediately on the Gulf of Florida in
24/24" North Latitude, about midway between Cape Florida and the Tortugas Islands, and seventy eight Miles North half East from the City of Havana, That it possesses one of the best and safest Harbours in the Southern Section of the United States, where Wessels of all Classes can enter and depart at any time, even without the aid of a Pilot, and from its local advantages generally, bids fair to become a place of great importance, not only in a commercial, but in a political point of view to the United States.
That wrecked Property to a great Amount has been brought here, and disposed of under various Laws and regulations of the Territory, which in many instances has not only given great dissatisfaction to the Owners of the Property, but to the Salvors. That the distance from hence to Pensacola, St Augustine and Charleston is so great (the nearest being four hundred and fifty Miles) that carrying wrecked Property from the Reef to any of those places would be attended with great delay, risk and Trouble, and in many instances could not be carried there at all, on account of the perishable state in which it is frequently found, and in most instances the Vessels wrecked, could not be sent away at all, as they are generally in such a cripled state that they cannot go to Sea with safety—
That at present when Property is saved, there is no Tribunal on the Coast that has any controul over it, and it can be carried away by the Owners, in defiance of any thing that can be done by the Salvors or Inhabitants, as has already been the case in some instances That the Revenue collected here from wrecked Property and otherwise, within the last two or three years, has amounted to upwards of One hundred thousand Dollars as can be seen by having reference to the Returns made by the Collector of this Port.
That there are at this time between Forty and Fifty Vessels engaged in wrecking and fishing on this Coast, the most of which belong to the Atlantic Ports of the United States.
That the County of Munroe of which Key West is the Capital, contains a population of five or six hundred Inhabitants, the most of whom get their living by wrecking, fishing and Turtling, and for the want of a Court or proper Tribunal, the Revenue Laws of the United States are liable to be daily violated, as by sending a Wessel of the class already described to Pensacola or St Augustine, for any alleged violation of the Law, for adjudication, would be attended with more Expence than the Property would defray, even in case of confiscation That One hundred and fifty Wessels of various descriptions have entered at this Port since the first Day of January last, as you will perceive by an abstract from the Books of the Collector annexed
<pb#725/>
That for the want of a Court of competent Jurisdiction here, the Property, Liberty, and even Lives of the Inhabitants of this Coast are in jeopardy. Therefore your Memorialists most humbly pray that your honorable Bodies will take their situation into serious consideration, and grant them relief by establishing a District Court of the United States at this place

<docbody>To the Honorable James Barbette Seeretary ef War Sir Senate & House of Representatives in Congress assembled The undersigned Inhabitants of East Florida and in the line of communication between Sº Augustine and Pensacola, beg leave to represent, That the main road recently made between these places by virtue of an appropriation from Congress, is in a condition so incomplete and imperfect as to be impassable.” In its direction it has been run unnecessarily circuitous, evidently to avoid expense in ditching &
causeways And in reference to the width which was contemplated by law to be 25 feet, instead of this it is so narrow in many places as not to admit of two carriages passing each other: where it runs through pine land the trees and stumps are so imperfectly removed that they cannot
<pb#727/>
be passed, and in places where the road leads through flat ground, the ditches instead of being sufficiently continuous to serve the purpose of draining, are cut in a manner so broken disjointed and slovenly as to serve no good purpose whatever. Where the road runs through low lands the few causeways that are made, are so narrow that a cart can scarcely pass, and they have been constructed in so careless and improper a manner, with logs and mud, that the holes and obstructions render it dangerous for horses to pass them; and throughout the whole line there is so miserly a deficiency in bridges and causeways as scarcely to entitle it to the name of a road. Under these circumstances therefore we ask leave to suggest, that if upon due examination it shall be found that there has been a misapplication of any part of the appropriation for constructing this road, that the same may be directed into its proper channel: but if the case should be otherwise, and that the whole of the appropriation has been regularly applied, then we lament its insufficiency for the object; for independently of the consideration that ourselves and the rest of the community in Florida derive no advantage from this road in its present imperfect and useless condition, in our ordinary intercourse and communication; we are shut out from the benefits which a well constructed road would naturally induce in a new Country, in the increase of population and its attendant consequences of increasing the value of private as well as public property.
And we beg leave to submit whether, if these considerations be not sufficient to induce a further appropriation to compleat the road, whether the interest of the United States at large does not imperiously demand it, in having a free passage for waggons and munitions of war between the several posts which this line of communication embraces.
We trust that these observations will be favourably received by the Pepartment Congress, and that measures will be adopted to compleat this important line of communication."

There will be another sale of the public Lands at Tallahassee on the

<docbody>COLONEL D. L. CLINCH 4: Infantry Pensacola Florida SIR, Having received from the Department of War the several despatches from the Governor of Florida concerning the late Indian disturbances near the Alachua Settlements,” I have determined after full consideration to place the whole subject in your hands and invest you with full power and responsibility for the defence of Florida.”
I have little doubt at present that the troops of your own Regiment including the force at Tampa Bay will suffice for this object. If not, the Company of Art” at St Augustine and after that, the Battalion of the 1* Infantry at Pensacola will be subject to your orders. This latter force however should not be diverted from its destination up the Mississippi unless the emergences of the case shall imperiously demand;—in deciding which, you will exercise a sound discretion.
In the measures you may think proper to adopt you will never lose sight of the great objects of the Department of War, the defence &
security of the inhabitants from hostile aggression; but it is equally necessary to observe, in your dealings, a constant and rigid deference to the dictates of Justice. In this respect, it will be necessary to make
<pb#731/>
all due allowance for the agitated temper of the public mind with regard to the Indians, and the deplorable straits which have driven many of them to acts of violence or trespass, for which the main body of the tribes may not be accountable. With our power, I hope also that they may be made to feel our justice.—
It is confidently expected that, with the troops of the regular Army at your disposal, you will be able to accomplish the object in view without resort to Militia, unless demanded by a more serious crisis than now appears.
You will communicate frequently with these Head Quarters and freely with the Executive of Florida;-and make such requisitions, from time to time on the Quarter Master General's & Subsistence Departments as the emergences of the service may require.-
General Gaines is to be expected soon in Florida, and in the event of his arrival near you, you will exhibit to him this letter and receive his further directions.”—
I am, Sir, Very Respectfully Your Ob' Sº

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</dochead>
<source>[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 2 sess.: DS 21 )</source>
<place-time>[January 6, 1827]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate and house of Representatives of the United States in congress assembled This memorial of the Legislative council of Florida, humbly representeth, that under your patronage they have beheld our Territory prosperously situated, increasing in population and gradually developing those resources of wealth, with which she is by nature so lavishly endowed.
With due gratitude for past favours, your memorialists from a belief that the General Government will ever conceive the growth of Florida intimately connected with the prosperity of our rising republic, have again presented themselves as petitioners before you, and ask that relief only which Congress in its wisdom may deem expedient to grant Your memorialists represent as the most serious grievance which afflicts our Territory the present location of the Indian tribes within our boundary; but above all, that they have been permitted to roam through the country, plundering those whom their avarice might seize on, and murdering those whom their revenge might select The tract of country assigned them by the treaty of 1823 * has always been complained of by them, as incompetent to their support, and the additional grant subsequently made them, has been the occasion of much dissatisfaction among many of our citizens: and probably not without cause; In addition to this, the present location ef is in the pathway of our settlers, and has already seriously impeded the settlement of the fairest part of Florida, and will now cloud all its prospects. The land in this vicinity is excellent; and but for the obstruction of this impertant unfortunate, though not less obnoxious tribe of beings would before this have borne on the current of the St. Johns, all the rich and luxuriant products of a tropical climate; besides they have never gone within their boundary but have scattered themselves in different parts of the Territory, and to the great annoyance of our citizens they have stripped the corn from our fields before our eyes; they have burned our houses, and murdered our citizens. All this they did, and have been doing for the last season
<pb#735/>
within twenty miles of the walls of St. Augustine and with impunity.
But more recent outrages have been committed which has thrown a damper on the spirits of our agriculturists, and present our country under a gloomy aspect. The most inhuman butcheries have been committed by them; a whole family has fallen a sacrafice to their vengeance, and individuals have been murdered while on the highway and engaged in that industry which constitutes the soul and energy of our country; our corn houses have been broke and plundered; our cattle killed, and our citizens driven from eth their homes, and threatened with all the horrors of Indian cruelty within the space of the last two months, and within forty miles of our capitol. The vigilince of our Governor, and the prompness of our Militia have for the present checked their outrages, and in some degree, quieted the fears of our citizens, but at what time and in what place, the bent bow, will let slip its arrow, the blood of our citizens will we fear, soon proclaim. In this gloomy situation of our Territory, your memorialists beg the speedy removal of these people out of the Territory. If they are dissatisfied with their present situation as appears, if they have never complied with the stipulations of their treaty as is manifest, if they have been guilty of the most glaring and unprovoked outrages, certainly, they have forfeited their claim to humanity, and are the fit subjects of our policy. We most earnestly recommend that they be forthwith, called to their boundary; and commissioners appointed to hold a new treaty with them, stipulating their immediate removal, from the Territory to the Indian Country West of the Mississippi, and that the commissioners be vested with full power to carry the same into execution.” It is not to be forgotten that these Indians have already cost the United States more than one hundred thousand dollars, and that their present condition requires another appropriation, or else they will be compelled to have resort to unlawful means for subsistence.
Your memorialists would further recommend, that a regiment be ordered to some point on the St. Johns, at as early a period as possible, for the protection of our frontier settlements, which are in that region entirely unprotected. Especially do your memorialists urge the adoption of this measure since it is by some confidently believed, that the Nation is bent on war, whether true or not, your memorialists will not pretend to determine, but nevertheless do unhesitatingly say, that their present movements, have a suspicious aspect.
The Council beg leave to call your attention to another subject intimately connected with the prosperity and settlement of the
<pb#736/>
country; and dependent entirely on the will of congress; it is the erection of a tribunal for the adjustment of land claims in East Florida. The great delay which has attended the fulfilment of that part of the treaty on the part of the United States, has been an incalculable impediment to emigration, and the cause of much distress and disappointment to our citizens; large purchases have been negociated, conditioned on the confirmation of the Grants, by the United States, which are now in the same state of uncertainty that they were four years ago. this has kept the capital, both of the speculator, and the land holder, idle, and in numerous instances has prevented the introduction to the Territory of slaves, and by consequence has kept the resources of the country unemployed, it is further represented for the information of Congress, that it is believed the unadjudicated lands in East Florida would support a population of twenty thousand individuals, and it is most confidently asserted, that the delay in settling these claims has kept out of the Territory, more than ten thousand emigrants, that before this would have been settlers in it but from, the fact that they were unable to obtain safe titles to lands they had selected to settle on; either from the United States or private individuals without being judged importunate, Your memorialists press on Congress the consideration of this subject, at as early a period as practicable.”
Your memorialists beg leave to call the attention of congress to another subject intimately connected with the interests of this Territory, and in different relation to the United States deserving their attention; it is the establishment of a judicial district, at or near Key West, a court at er hear with with the same jurisdiction of the other Superior Courts in the Territory established at this place would afford great protection and relief to commerce, by the speedy interposition of the laws of the United States in cases of wrecked property; It is not to be forgotten that the revenue to the United States from the customs at this place during the last year amounted to a sum exceeding sixty thousand dollars.
At present there is no protection to individual rights in that section of the country or measurably so, partly from the mixed character of the population that might be expected in such a situation, and partly from their great distance to any high court. It is also stated that there are at, or near Key West, a population of about three hundred souls, and whether fixed or transient, should be controlled and goverened by the penalties of law.
By an act of Congress, the secretary of the Treasury was authorised to select two entire Townships of land, one in East, and one in
<pb#737/>
West Florida for the endowment of a college.” Your memorialists beg that so much of the law as requires that these Townships should be selected, one in East, and one in West Florida, and that they shall be selected entire be repealed, and that they executive of the Territory be allowed to select the same in fractions or parts of sections and where he may choose provided such selection shall not interfere with the rights of any individual; The reason is obvious, because under that law the Territory would receive little or no advantage from the appropriation, and the intention of Congress would be defeated, for in neither section of the country can be found good land enough unclaimed by individuals and in one body to include the donation.
Your memorialists think it their duty further to state, that in the present situation of the Territory, a requisition of two hundred stand of rifles and the same number of muskets to be at the disposal of the Executive for the use of the Territory, would be of infinite importance, this is recommended for a great variety of reasons, the principal of which are, the more effectual organization of the Militia, and to relieve our poor inhabitants from the expence of arming themselves in those cases of inability which often occur Your memorialists would call the attention of Congress to another subject. By an act of Congress approved 24th. May 1824 One quarter Section of land was given to the Territory for a site on which to locate a permanent seat of Government, to be sold, and the proceeds to be appropriated for the erection of public buildings.” In conformity to this act, the quarter section was located and sold, and the funds appropriated to the erection of a capital, which is now in a state of progression. By the same act the Executive of the Territory was authorised to select three other quarter sections to be reserved from sale at the general sale of land in East Florida, these reserves were made Your memorialists respectfully request that Congress would by special act grant these reserves to the Territory, to be appropriated as the Governor and Legislative council may deem most conducive to its present and future benefit this is more especially requested at this time, since it is believed that at no period could the liberality of Congress be extended with as many arguments of the necessity and of as much certainty of advantage as the present presents.
2** Your memorialists would recommend another change in the organic law which gives to the Governor by and with the consent of
<pb#738/>
the Legislative Council the appointment of all officers, civil and of the militia, not otherwise provided for by law.” The people desire the privilege of electing all their county officers except the Judges of the Inferior courts; and as this is a subject of little or no importance to the public at large, your memorialists conceive no impropriety #
the ekahge can be supposed in this change *
Your Memorialists further represent as a great impropriety, that officers appointed by the United States, to fill offices within this Territory for example the district Attorney and Marshal of Middle Florida, who have for the term of two years received the emoluments of the same, and have never resided a day within a hundred miles of the district in which their duties were to be performed.
1*** Your memorialists further represent as a grievance, several provisions in the organic law of the Territory passed by Congress in
1826.” one of which is the law preventing the Judges of the Superior Courts from being required to hold a courtbut in one other place in their respective districts, than the one assigned by the law of the United States. This law seems to have had its origin in a mistaken knowledge of the true interests of the people of this Territory, and to have been adopted in direct opposition to their unanimous voice. Your memorialists are constrained thus plainly to speak because they are anxious and determined to lay before you the glaring oppression of this law;
why the Judges of the United States courts should be discharged from that duty they are paid to perform, and why your obedient citizens should thus be laid under tribute at the expence of that tribute subsistence they owe themselves and their families, are questions we are unable to solve. The inconvenience and distress occasioned to your citizens is easily conceived when it is known, that under the present restriction, suitors and jurors may be compelled to attend court at a distance of one hundred and fifty miles from their homes;
In some instances individuals have been under the necessity of selling their horses and cattle to defray the expences of attending a court where they had no business; we most earnestly desire that this restriction on the Legislative Council in the organic law, may be recinded, and we do with due deference to your decision think that the Legislative power of this territory would never impose an unjust duty on any public officer, or misrepresent the true interests of their constituents.”
<pb#739/>
Another change is prayed for in the organic law which makes the marshals of the districts the ministerial officers of the courts, and gives them all the duties of said officers whether arising under the laws of the United States or of the Territory. Your memorialists think it a matter of much indifference to congress whether the business of our courts arising under the laws of the Territory be done by a United States or Territorial officer, and that under this view of the subject congress would gratify the people whose innocent prejudices in a free government should ever be regarded by giving them this prerogative, this part of the organic law was adopted in direct opposition to the avowed will of the great mass of the people Your memorialists for the information of Congress recommend the erection of a light house at some point at, or between St. Marks and the Appalachicola: and also one at the mouth of the St. Johns,”
The commercial interests of the community require and have seriously suffered for the want of these guides at these places and especially at the latter We also strongly recommend the establishment of a custom house at Jacksonville on the river St. Johns; And for these reasons, that it will be a great relief to ship masters coming from a foreign port; who are now compelled to travel from forty to fifty miles to enter their vessels, and because it is a place of considerable enterprize. Another reason why this point is recommended in preference to any other, is partly the healthy situation of the place and its commodious distance from the mouth of the river, and partly because it is the centre of navigation in East Florida On the subject of the florida canal, your memorialists deem it scare necessary to touch; but in passing cannot but acknowledge their gratitude for the attention already bestowed on that important subject by the wisdom of congress, and most anxiously wait their decision And finally under the liberal patronage of the General Government we think the prosperity of our Territory will outstrip the anticipations of its warmest advocates. The representations of the enemies of our Territory that it was barren and worthless, have already been refuted by the agricultural experiments of our yeomen; and when the great variety, and facilities of our soil and climate shall be properly developed all those erroneous opinions will be corrected.

SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 7th Ins’ “
In explanation of the cause which has delayed the answer to your communication of the 16" Ult” “I have to refer, in a general way to the heavy press of duties upon this office, which, with all my time, I am just able to get along with; and to several calls of late, by the Congress, for information, the answers to which, in the form of reports to the Secretary of War, devolved also on me.
I have to assure you that I will not allow an hour to pass that can be made applicable to your communication, without employing it for that purpose.
With every disposition in the Department to secure justice to the Citizens of Florida, by a restoration of their runaway slaves, it is not known how any steps can be taken except such as are authorized by the intercourse law of 1802. An express order was issued to the agent, on the 28* Feb” “last, in relation to this subject. It is not known what effect his late absence from the Territory may have had in delaying its execution; but now that he is about to resume his duties it is to be hoped the proper steps may be taken to recover the Slaves, and give them back to their proper owners.
Would it not be advisable for all concerned to forward descriptive lists to the Agent? It would doubtless facilitate the recovery of their
<pb#743/>
property by enabling him with more ease to identify it. The attention of the agent will be called to the order to which I have referred.”—

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Off: Ind: Affairs, 9" January, 1827.</place-time>
<docbody>To THE HONbie J. M. WHITE, Ho: of Rep" U. S.
SIR, I am directed by the Secretary of War in reply to your letter to him of the 16” Ult” ” to state, that General Brown was ordered soon after your conversation with the Secretary to give discretionary power to Col” Clinch, to establish the Military post, to which you have reference, at such point, as in his judgment would best subserve the object for which a change from its present location is saught.” There is no doubt but that this order has been complied with.
<pb#744/>
In regard to your purpose “shortly to send to the Department an application, for the losses sustained by the inhabitants from the Indians,” I am directed to state that every possible attention will be paid to such application; but to suggest whether the objects of the applicants would not be more readily subserved by passing these claims, as is customary, through the hands of the agent, or the Governor of the Territory, whose duty it would become to examine and report them to the Department with such testimony as might be adduced in their support—And especially so as they will have to be tested by the intercourse Law of 1802,” it being the only authority on which the Department can act in regard to claims of any kind, whether these relate to spoliations committed by the Indians on the whites, or by the whites on the Indians.
The Secretary regrets that any portion of the Citizens of Florida should suffer by the depredations of those unfortunate people, and would be happy, as he believes their own interest would be subserved by it, to promote any proper measures that may be devised for their removal from Florida into a Country where they would be at once freed from the temptations to depredate which the supplies of their more provident neighbors set before them; and from all occasions, it is to be hoped of future wants, and sufferings.
On the subject of the notice taken by the Grand Jury of the Superior Court of East Florida, of “the manner in which the Indians are permitted to overrun the Country to the great injury and alarm of the inhabitants,” “I am directed to state that every measure of precaution has been taken, and instructions duly issued by the Department to ensure a fulfilment of the stipulation in the Treaty which provides certain limits for the Indians, and to insure their occupancy of the same; and it is with regret that the measures adopted in conformity to those instructions appear not to have proved successful.
I am directed to state also that the memorial of certain planters and Citizens of East Florida lying South of Sº Augustine, to the President of the United States has been read by him; * and that the causes of complaint have heretofore, as stated, been attempted to be removed.
In the first instance to provide the Indians with the means of subsistence until they could provide something for themselves, he ordered Governor Duval to expend at one time two thousand, and at another five thousand Dollars from the Contingent fund of the Indian Department; and that subsequently the Congress provided 20,000$ for the same object.” These provisions it was hoped would have kept these
<pb#745/>
suffering people quiet, until, by the adoption of other measures which were directed, they would have been settled within the limits assigned to them by the Treaty, and made something themselves on which to subsist when the cause of the complaint now made would have ceased. That these measures should have failed, is a source of regret, to the President, who will be happy also in carrying into effect any measure that may secure to the Citizens of Florida a freedom from their present relation to the Indians, of that Territory, and the Indians a home that shall not have connected with it so many temptations to pillage; and where their wants may be supplied by the bounties of nature, and in a Country that shall promote alike their own happiness and the peace and security of our border population.

They will do mischief if not intimidated, and I must advise that a competent milatary force be stationed near the agency. I have found it necessary to order out the sub agent Majº Phagan with another party of the Apalachicola warriors, to arrest all wandering indians west of the Suwannee,” Majº Phagan is an excellent man and valuable officer, he divided his party and without doing any injury to Indians he succeeded in driving out of the Ocilla Swamps the Indians who were concerned in the late murder, * Acknowledgment not found.</place-time>
<docbody><pb#746/>
and a part of his men under an active and brave young man, a M’
Downing succeeded in capturing two indians who now in jail that were concerned in or knew of the murder committed on the two Paris:s lately murdered in Georgia. I hope from these prisoners to obtain the necessary information the whole of the party that were concerned.
The militia and Indians who were called out have behaved well and are all discharged. No other Indians than those I reported to the Secretary have been killed or injured—and those were part of the company who murdered Mº Carrs family. The prisoners here are treated with humanity, but are strongly guarded, and will be examined in a day or two—when I will communicate to the department any information, which may be obtained deserving of notice.
Owing to the recent troubles the expences of the Indian department have been greater than would otherwise have been.” But the Secretary will see that the state of affairs did not permit me to consult him on the subject of the expense as it was unexpected, and delay might have been as injurious as it would have been imprudent. I have no fear of general hostilities. but danger is apprehended from the marauding bands of the Mickasukee tribe. The whole report of the sub agent shews that from these indians our frontier settlers have much to fear 59

<place-time>Land Office TALLAHASSEE 10th Jamy 1827</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In anticipation of the public land Sales directed to be held at Tallahassee on the 15* Ins" on the 1* day of this month we closed our Office against the pre emption claimants. This we deemed to be our duty under the provisions of the act of the 5* Feb 1813, which requires “that all lands to be sold by virtue of this act shall be entered with the Register at least two weeks before the time of the commencement of the public Sales in the district where in the land lies.”" The term “district” in the commencement of that act, as well as its Subsequent introduction in the proviso, we concieve can only be applied to the Eastern and Western Land Districts of Florida, and not to the Townships proclaimed for Sale. If the Sale should actually take place on the 15* Inst, we shall be bound by the law so far as we are the judges of it, to consider all the unadjusted claims bared by its operation, and we shall await the further instructions of the Department on the subject. The claimants have had timely notice of our view of the law, and have generally governed themselves accordingly.
Our Office was crowded for weeks immediately preceding the time we had appointed for closing it. the 9{fiee. A few of the persons entitled to the right of pre emption were unexpectedly called out against the Indians, in consequence of which they were eehºpelled be unable to make their entries two weeks before the time appointed for the public land Sales. These persons we have since permitted to make their entries Sihee that the, believing that the measure would be approved by the Government. You will percieve from our returns that the numerical order of our receipts and certificates has been is greatly disarranged, but this is a dificulty which we have found it impossible to avoid. It has frequently occurred that claims Supported by the fairest and most undoubted testimony, in the first instance, after being entered have been impeached, and on a reexamination we have been compelled to reject them.
Having no power under the law to Summon witnesses in behalf of the U. States we have been compelled alone to act on the exparty testimony of the willing witnesses introduced by the claimants.
In every instance we have endeavored to execute the law agreeably to our understanding of its provisions, and the instructions of the Department on the Subject, but we regret to inform you that we by the mandate of the Judge of the Superior Court of this district we have been compelled to act in total disregard of both. The act of the 5*
<pb#749/>
of February 1813 as well as the orders of the department requires that the entries under the pre emption Law shall be made in entire q"
Secº to be bounded by the Sectional and divisional lines, yet you will discover from the writs of Mandamus accompanying many of our receipts, that we have been compelled by the process of the Court to permit entries to be made in 8” of Sections to Suit the convenience of the Settlers, and the entries thus made are frequently in different Sections, Townships and ranges. The opinion of the Court in this regard though truly absurd is less exceptionable than in those cases where there are two persons entitled to the right of pre emption Settled on the Same Q Sec" We have been compelled to allow such persons to enter thee Q'. Sections, though the law emphatically provides “that in no instance Shall any person be entitled to a preference in the purchase for more than one Q'. Setion in addition to his portion of the fractional Q'. Setion on which he lives.” We are clear eh in the Subjeet opinion that the term fractional Q'. Section is applicable alone to the fractions made by the Surveyors of the land. and that an entire Q'. Sec" containing its full compliment of one hundred and Sixty acres, cannot become fractional by the Simple circumstance of two persons Settling upon it, when the Settlement of one person would not produce the same effect. Extraordinary as the opinion of the Court on this Subject appears to us, we have conceived it to be our duty to obey the mandamus and leave the department to exercise its discretion in issuing or withholding the patent in Such cases. It is certainly an abuse of the liberality of the Government which requires correction. Fortunately the opinion of the Court on this point was not given until a very few days before the office closed in consequence of which there are but few entries made under this Singular decission.
It is very important however that the deeissieh opinion of the department on this Subject Should be known as early as practicable, for if the public Sales should not take place on the 15* Ins' the office, will again be opened. There are yet many claims to be adjusted, and in every instance where there are two persons on the same Q'. Setion, (which is frequently the case, or may be made the case, when they have the right by judicial decree, to Say that two 8* in different Sections, Townships, and Ranges, form a Q'. Section) they will endeavour to enter three QF Sections instead of two.
We have the honour to be Very Respectfully Your Obt St G. W. WARD

<docbody>MY DEAR SIR I received a letter a few days since from my friend Col. White informing me that the office of Secretary of the Territory of Florida was about to become vacant.” It will become Col: Whites duty to recommend some gentleman in Florida, and I would not have him to do otherwise. This sentiment, I impressed upon you when I
had the pleasure to see you in Washington on my way to this place.
I could not permit Col: White to endanger his bright prospects in Florida by any act of frendship to me; and were he to exert himself in my behalf, his constituents would very properly become dissatisfied—Yourself, and some other of my friends in Washington will therefore confer on me the favour, of presenting my recommendations to the Executive—A general letter, signed by every member of that Branch of the Legislature to which I belong, may be regarded as expressive of the wish of the State upon this subject; and I flatter myself that there will be no difficulty in obtaining such a letter. I wº now enclose it to you but it yet wants the signatures of a few o our Senators who are absent from Richmond—Several of them will write letters to their acquaintances in Washington—My friend Mr Cabel ” has written to Mº Wirt to secure his influence in my favor. The appointment will not, I presume, be made immediately, and I shall have time to send you such testimonials as my intimate friends here can procure. They will entitle me to the appointment if it is given to any gentleman out of the Territory—A letter from Judge Brooke "
to M' Clay would be of service to me, and as I believe you are a relation & Friend of his, you could procure it without difficulty—I have the pleasure to know him, but he is now in Fredericksburg—Some of my friends here, would obtain letter from him were he here now in Richmond. M* George Graham has been my friend for many years past & I have a right to calculate upon his good offices. Mº M*Ilheny wrote to you after the result of the Senatorial election was known.

<docbody>D SIR Having learned from an experiment of nearly two years what the Offices of Register and Receiver are likely to be worth in this district, we would represent that the Compensation falls very far Short of all reasonable expectation both there and here and we deem it a duty we owe to ourselves to call the attention of the department to the Subject. Our returns to the G* L. office will Shew what has been received by us under the best circumstances that ever can occur and
[MS. torn]t will be found that after deducting a very reasonable estimate for Keeping these offices the time is very near at hand that we shall actually Sink money by them and that at the best they have very little (if any) more than met the actual expences attending them, to the North and West where clerk hire, boarding &" is very low it would be very different, but there is more than one hundred per cent difference in regard to these expences there and here. Both our offices require Clerks of the very first accuracy and respectability and it is well Known that Such clerks in Orleans Mobile and other Southern cities are getting from 700 to $1200 Pr. annum say $700
We pay for boarding $20 Pr. month 240
very indifferent office rooms rent for $10 Pr. month 120
For fires candles & incidental expences 100
$1160
And we might Safely venture to Say that considering the Small portion of this little territory that is good land and the great proportion of that that has been ocupied by preemptions and donations to individuals and public institutions that from and after the ensuing May Sale we Shall according to the present arrangement be brought in debt by them. We therefore hope thMS. torn] the department will make such represent[MS. torn] of this matter or take Such Steps as to place
[MS. torn] on a better footing we have no objection to a Safe limit

<docbody>SIR On the third day of the public land Sales we received by express your letter of the 6* inst with its enclosures.
In Consequence of the representations of the Legislative Council we had Anticipated the postponement of the Sales, but as there were many persons present at the time appointed who were desirous of purchasing and as the lands first to be offered were generally of the most inferior quality we Continued to offer a Small quantity each day until the return of the express. Four townships only were offered in the three days Sale very little of which was Sold and generally at the Government Price. The Indian alarm was a very unnecessary One, and had it not have been encouraged by the precipitation of the Legislative Council the Sale would have been well attended and the lands would have sold for good prices.
The Office will again be opened for the adjustment of Pre emption Claims According to your instructions.
The lands remaining unsold together with those you have designated in your letter of the 16th inst & will be immediately advertised for Sale on the 3rd Monday of May Next. We enclose for the information of the department a Copy of a Resolution of the Legislative Council requesting the President of the United States to Cause to be brought into Market at the next land Sales, all the lands South of Township 6, in Ranges 7, 8, 9 & 10. South and East, On enquiring at the Sur-
<pb#764/>
veyors Office we find that the greater Part of that tract of Country has not been Sectioned in Consequence of which it Cannot at that time be brought into market but as we Concur entirely in opinion with the Legislative Council with regard to the great importance both to the United States and this Territory in having a Population thrown into that Part of the Country as early as Practicable and believing that this Can only be done by Offering the lands for Sale on the 3rd Monday of May next, we have agreed to assume the responsibility of inserting in one Publication of the lands to be offered for Sale at that time the following Townships Subject to the approval or disapproval of the President, In Range 7. Townships 4.5. 6. and fractional townships 7 & 8.
In Range 8. Township 4. 5.6. & 7. and fractional Townships 8: & 9.
In Range 9. Township 8, & fractional Townships 9. 10 & 11.
In Range 10. Fractional Townships 11 & 12. The greater part of these lands are said to be poor tho' the fractional Townships Are considered fertile and very desirable, You will at once Perceive the importance of bringing these lands into market when you are informed that except in the immediate neighborhood of this place there is not an inhabitant east of the Meridian and South of the base line.
The lands having been Surveyed will not populate until they are offered for Sale as no man will risk his improvements on lands which he may daily expect to be brought into market. The Sale of these lands will immediately bring those in their neighborhood into notice and will add much to their value, These Additional Townships may be Considered by the department as forming too great a number to be offered at one time, but when you Consider the large proportion of poor land and the number of acres which have been & will be Covered by Preemption Claims You will find there will not be more good land Contained in them than the market will require. If there was Sufficient time we would prefer Presenting the Subject to the department before we make the advertisement but this not being the Case we can see no possible injury which Can result from their being advertised as there is Ample time for us to receive the instructions of the department on the Subject before the Sale *
We have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your Most Ob" Servt R K CALL

[Enclosure]
Resolution to the President by the Legislative Council
[January 20, 1827]
Resolved That the President of the United States be requested to cause to be offered for sale at the next Land Sales in this Territory, All the Lands South of Township Six, Ranges Seven, eight, nine and ten, S. & E. below the Basis Parrallel, which will bring into market of Range Seven, Township Six, Seven and fraction of Townships eight;
of range eight, Townships, six, seven, eight and fraction of Township nine; of range nine, Townships, six, seven, eight, and nine; of Range Ten, Townships six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and fraction of Township twelve.
The reasons which induce the Legislative Council to deem this course advisable, is the fact, that very few settlers have yet occupied that section of country, and the Indians have been in the habit of cultivating all the good lands in those townships, which has supported large bodies of them so near the vicinity of the settlements of the emigrant as to create considerable alarm among them; the late Indian murders were committed by Indians who have formed part of these settlers, and until the good lands of this section of country are disposed of to actual settlers it will be impossible without a large Military force, to keep the Indians from occupying it.
The lands upon the Stinhatchie river which waters some of these Townships are good, and it is believed if they were offered for Sale, would be immediately occupied, and form a barrier against the further intrusion of the Indians. Those lands which form the remaining part of these Townships are well adapted for grazing, and would be profitably used for that purpose. From these reasons, it is believed that their sale at this time would advance the interest of the Territory and afford protection to our frontier settlers.
Therefore resolved, that the foregoing resolution, be transmitted to the President of the United States for his consideration H. D. STONE President of the Legislative Council Adopted 20th January 1827. GEORGE EDWIN TINGLE Clerk I William P.

<docbody>DEAR SIR We have learned that at the passage of the preemption law for Florida of of 1826 ° an effort was made to get an appropriation for carrying it into effect by us and that it was objected that it would be impossible to say at that time what would be a proper compensation, we have acted on upwards of four hundred cases more than three *
of which has been confirmed these comprehend all as we believe that are within the limits of the lands proclaimed for sale in this month and some beyond those limits and shall be able to make report of them by the next mail to the department, and not seeing how else Congress can learn anything of the difficulties attending this business we have thought it only proper to represent to you, that we were closely employed in this business at the office every day in the investigation of these claims for about five months, and toward the close of the time our office was kept crowded until late at night, we would represent that besides the usual proofs necessary to prove their preemption rights it involved the impeachment of Testimony in numerous cases all of which had to be patiently attended to and these contested claims had in most instances to be laid over from time to time to give the parties an opportunity of getting additional testimony, and from the circumstance of the surveys being made after these settlements were made in perhaps half the cases two or more were thrown on the same quarter section which entitled them to one or more q sections of the nearest land of equal value and it was indispensable to have proof that the quarters chosen in addition were the nearest of equal value; this circumstance alone produced a great deal of Controversy among the claimants, for the same tracts were wanting by others in the same neighbourhood having also a right to lands of equal value near them and these numerous cases presented continual difficulty and labour. In fact it has been the most harassing and difficult and disagreeable business that has ever fallen to our lot, nor was it in our power during the whole time to attend to anything whatever apart from the office.” We will also represent that it increases the duties of our clerks beyond what they can well accomplish for which extra service they have a just claim as it occasioned them to do a great deal of their work in the night and if they are not remunerated they will
<pb#767/>
be very unwilling to go through another campaign unless we pay them out of our own pockets which are rather empty. Believing that you will give the necessary attention to this subject 7 we remain D Sir With much Respect Yr. Mo. ob. Servº"

<docbody>THOMAS L MCKENNEY Gen.' Super" of Indian Affairs SIR Under the Command of Maj Phagan the Sub Agent there were three Indian Chiefs and fifty warriors—they arrested many Indians, but injured none.
Their conduct was such as to meet my approbation, and their services tended greatly to restore peace and order between the hostile Indians and our citizens. I have given to them in presents for their services $250 with my promise, as they expected something more to lay their services before the Department. I will Suggest Sir, that Maj Phagan ought to receive some Compensation for his arduous Services in Commanding the Appalachicola Indians—he is a most valuable Officer and deserves the patronage of the government—There is no duty that he hesitates in performing, he is honest, active, and brave The Indians were in Service 30 days—If the Department can allow the Sub Agent the pay and emoluments of a Captain for one month for his unusual and arduous, but necessary services, it would be highly gratifying—if the Indians should be removed from Florida, I recommend Maj Phagan as the person to conduct them to their destination.

To THE HON” THE CHAIRMAN of the COMM** OF IND: AFFAIRS, U. S. Senate.
SIR, I have the honor to accompany this with the copy of a letter from Governor Duval to the Department; * and of one to him from Oren Marsh, Sub-agent.” From these letters may be inferr'd the condition of the Florida Indians; and the high probability that they will be unable, in the future, to derive a subsistence from either the forests or the soil.
It will remain for Congress to decide what further provision, and of what kind, ought to be made for the preservation of the Florida Indians; and this disposition is made of the subject with a view of possessing the Committee of a knowledge of the existing state of things, and of enabling it to make such report to the Congress as the case may require, either in a general provision for their removal to a more productive Country, and which I esteem to be preferable; or in the event of failure in such general provision such other measures of relief as may be esteemed best. There can be little doubt but the Country is inadequate to the support of those Indians.

I have the honor to add that of the 20,000$, appropriated by Congress for the relief of the Florida Indians the balance, (upwards of

HON JOSEPH M. WHITE H R.
SIR, In reply to your letter of the 30” Inst,” requesting my opinion as to the construction of the 3° Section of the Act of the 22"
April 1826,” relative to preemptions, I have to state, that alth" the provisions of that Section allow as a maximum to each person entitled to a preemption, who may be settled on the Same Quarter Section, one quarter Section in addition to a portion of the quarter Section or Fractional section on which he is settled, yet it does not necessarily follow that in every possible case, the Register and Receiver would be justifiable in allowing entries for the maximum quantity. On this subject, I think the Act has invested the Register and Receiver with discretionary powers, which will and ought generally to be exercised in favor of the Settler, and allow to him the maximum granted by law, yet there are many conceivable cases where the Officers may be justified in refusing to grant them their certificates for this maximum.
I enclose for your information a copy of the instructions * given to the Register and Receiver under the Act of the 23° April 1826, in relation to the propriety of that part which confines the location of entire legal quarter Sections, as fractional Sections, I refer you to the provisions of the 1* Section of the Act passed the 5* of February

<place-time>[January 31, 1827]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, of America in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Subscribers, resident inhabitants of the Eastern District of the Territory of Florida, respectfully sheweth.
That your Memorialists have viewed with pain and grief the course of legislation pursued, on many occasions, by the Legislative Council of this Territory.
At the late Session of the Council several acts were passed, which your Memorialists consider as repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and Subversive of the Soundest principles of justice, law, and good morals.
Among these acts, your memorialists respectfully invite the attention of Congress to one entitled “An act dividing the Territory of Florida into thirteen districts and providing for the election of members of the Legislative Council,” ” by the eighth section of which, declaring the qualification of electors, it appears that the Spanish inhabitants of this Territory, who were residents at the time of the Cession of Florida to the United States, are entirely excluded from the right of voting at such elections.
Your Memorialists entertain the firm belief that it never was the intention of the Government of the United States to deprive any portion of the permanent population of this Territory of the elective franchise; and desirous of cultivating and Supporting the utmost harmony and good feeling between the native Citizens of the United States and the ancient inhabitants of this Country, and that they should enjoy, to the utmost extent, all the Civil and political rights of Citizens of the United States, while resident in this Territory, your Memorialists earnestly pray that Congress will, by a declaratory act, place them upon the same footing as citizens of the United States, in regard to those rights, and by that means put it out of the power of the Legislative Council, in any manner whatever, to infringe their rights and privileges, or render them in any degree questionable.
Your Memorialists cannot forbear to express their deep regret that many of the acts of the Legislative Council passed at their late Session should go into operation before they shall have received the sanction and confirmation of Congress; and they respectfully pray that an act
<pb#773/>
may be passed, at the present Session of Congress, declaring that, in future, no law of the Legislative Council of this Territory shall be of any force or effect until the same shall have been laid before Congress and confirmed.

<place-time>Copy MILLEDGEVILLE Feby 2” 1827</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I arrived here yesterday in eighteen days from Richmond, which place I could not leave earlier than about noon of Jan’ 14* from a variety of circumstances beyond my control. Indeed the accounts of Indian disturbances on the line between Georgia and East Florida by rendering it doubtful, for a short time, whether the Commissioners could proceed in their work if arrived, seemed to me fully to justify the short delay I made, in weather of almost unexampled severity as to cold, while suffering an indisposition infinitely the most serious for eleven years back.
I found lying at the Post Office here a packet for me containing, relative relative to the claim of Baley " for Indian rations, several papers, to the subject of which I shall devote a very particular attention before I leave Georgia and shall forward a report containing all the information I can obtain, and my opinion, as soon as the duty
<pb#774/>
of running the line will permit me. The important packet containing the papers from the Department of State mentioned in the communication from that over which you preside, dated Dec 23° has not yet reached me. The report of the Commissioners * appointed under the third article of the treaty of San Lorenzo el real * is a document without which the Commissioners cannot well proceed. Since I
had the honor last to address yet the Department I have seen that treaty and have procured a copy of Ellicots journal,” from which I
have the first information that the two extremities of the line to be run have been geographically determined, and the Eastern which was not certainly indicated by the treaty, actually marked, so as to be readily and surely discoverable at this time. But I have no evidence that the report made jointly by the two commissioners, which by a provision in the treaty was to make a part of it of course is now binding upon the United States and Georgia, does correspond fully with what is stated in the journal. Still I cannot entertain a doubt about that correspondence as the journal was prepared for the press after the report had been received and acknowledged by the two governments. Upon finding that the packet expected in consequence of the communication to me from the Department of War of Dec 23** had not arrived, I immediately enquired of the Governor here whether the State or any individual possessed the report in question and am informed that it cannot be procured here. On that occasion I found that the journal of the United States Commissioner Ellicot was here considered as sufficiently authentic, and that it was expected I should proceed “in conjunction with the representative of the constituted authorities of Georgia” to run a straight line from the mound thrown up by the two commissioners at the outlet of the waters of the Oko-a fon-ooka swamp into the Sº Mary's river, to the junction between the Chatahooche and Flint branches of the Apalachicola river, which line was to constitute the permanent boundary between the State of Georgia and the territory of Florida. The commissioner for Georgia is at his residence in Darien 170 miles from this place. I shall set out for that place on Sunday or Monday next, * See ante, p. 518, n.
<pb#775/>
my horses requiring that much rest before I can resume my journey with certainty of the performance from them which is requisite.
I have only to assure the Department that there shall be no want of diligence or fidelity on my part upon the occasion, but I cannot omit to remark that the expense of the work must be greatly increased from the necessity of proceeding without money there being only 80
dollars in my hands at present. If the report of the Comm' in 1800
should not reach me in time I shall be under the necessity of proceeding by Ellicot's journal but shall be very exact in the application of the information it contains, as a very little deviation might leave on the Georgia side of the line some of the most valuable parts of the great Ooka-fon-ooka swamp, in which besides its capacity to undergo general draining there are some of the most fertile lands of all the South, appearing like islands, or rather Oases, in the marshy desert.
Nothing requisite shall be neglected so as to allow of any disagreement between that terrestrial arch of a circle which is already the geographical line, and the future boundary of jurisdiction, its constituent, which is now to be traced and marked. The Eastern extremity is considered here to be in Latitude 30°. 34’ . 48’’. I am not yet informed what means are contemplated by the Georgia party for connecting the compass line so as to ensure its correspondence with the terrestrial arc, but I cannot try it my astronomical instruments for the purpose being in their possession, nor does it seem to be expected here that any such means will be used. I do not pretend to be a practical astronomer having never had it in my power to procure the necessary instruments to qualify myself, but I have a sufficient acquaintenance with the theory of the science to enable me to detect all errors, and of course to guard against them. Nothing whatever in the guise of advantage, or of the still greater temptation; relief, could induce me to undertake what I did not feel an entire consciousness of the capacity to perform. If I had escaped malicious insinuations, predictions and constructions, I should have been surprized, in the actual state of our public morals. It shall be my care to insure the falsity of that future malice which I must as certainly incur as I live.36 -

SIR, I have the honor in compliance with your request made of me to day,” to state, that in my opinion it is not possible for a Sub-agent of Indian Affairs to subsist, in Florida, at the present rates of living in that Territory upon the allowance which the law provides, viz:
500 Dollars. My opinion is based on the returns which are made from the Governor, who is Ex officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs; and which show the prices of the means of living; and upon the fact, that, to retain the services of those agents, of whom there are two—
Majº Phagan and Oren Marsh,_the Governor has brought upon himself an obligation of about two thousand Dollars, in furnishing them with supplies, without which he writes they could not have lived.
The Hon” The Chairman of the Commitee of Indian Affairs of the Senate, self-moved, I mean without any recommendation, from the Department, at least none is known to me, has very providently proposed an increase on the Salary of Sub-agents, from 500 to 750$, but this, as I see from the tenor of the bill, will be applicable to those, only, who fill independent posts—I mean posts not within the limits of a principal agency. Could the bill not be amended, so as to provide for the same pay to the Sub-agents in Florida? indeed I think the provision should embrace all.”
If necessary, I will send to you extracts from Governor Duval's letters, which will be full on this subject.—

SIR. I now return the papers relative to the decisions of Judge Woodward in relation to the preemption claims in Florida which had heretofore been submitted to you,” but returned with a request that I would make out a statement, shewing the points on which the decisions of the Judge interfered with the instructions from this Office.
From a comparison of the instructions marked A.” with the decisions of the Court, marked B & C, it will appear that there are two points on which the decisions of the Judge conflicts with the Instructions to the Land Officers.-
First. That the assignee in the meaning of the Act granting preemptions * is, a legal representative, alth” the case referred to by the Judge is as much against as in favor of his decision. I do not consider this a question of such moment as to appeal from the decision.—
Second. That the tract allowed as a Preemption may be located in eighths of Sections. This decision is in opposition to the express terms of the 1st & 2nd, Sections of the Act of the 5 Feb. 1813.
L. U. S. p 496,” and to the practices and usages of this Office under that Act.
The decision of the Judge it is presumed is founded on the provisions of the 1st section of the Act of the 24 April 1820,” which authorizes the public Lands to be sold in half quarter Sections—
and this Act would have justified the decision, but for the proviso to the 1 Section of the Act of the 5* of Feby 1813. the 2'nd Section of said Act & the evident intent & spirit of the Act giving the right of Preemption passed the 1 Session of 19 Congress p. 26.
as manifested by the terms used throughout the said Act and particularly in the proviso to the 5th Section thereof All which is respectfully submitted “

<docbody>To COL” GAD HUMPHREYS, Indian Agent, &c. Sº Augustine, Florida.
SIR, Frequent complaints have been made to the Department respecting Slaves claimed by Citizens of Florida, which are in the possession of the Indians; all of which have been acted on here, in issuing such orders to you as it was expected would be promptly obeyed—and lead to such investigations as should issue in fixing the right of the Claimants, or establishing the contrary—and that these proceedings would be followed by the proper reports to the Department. Nothing satisfactory has been received of you.
I now, by direction of the Secretary of War, again call your attention to this subject, in a general way; and particularly in regard to the claim of Margaret Cook; and require it of you forthwith to cause the Negroes, claimed by her, to be surrendered to her upon her entering into a bond with sufficient security of which you will judge to abide by the decision of such Tribunal as it may be esteemed proper, by the Secretary of War, to establish to decide upon the claim.
You will at the same time satisfy the Indians of the propriety and Justice of this course. Tell them the claim is set up; and that this act is merely to secure the property until the right is decided, when if it be in them they will be restored; and if, in th claimant they ought not to expect to hold them.
It is expected of you to report generally upon such other like claims as may exist in regard to Slaves.”—

<docbody>REG' & REC' at Tallahassee GENTLEMEN, The several communications of M" Call “furnishing extracts from the decisions of Judge Woodward relative to points arising under the Act granting preemptions in Florida,” were submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury,” who is not disposed to assent to the correctness of any of those decisions, and he has therefore instructed me * to request that you would cause appeals to be entered in all cases where the decision of the Judge varies from your own view of the Law, or the instructions you have received from this Office:-
One case of appeal on each point, will be sufficient to test the principle with an understanding that the other cases are to await the decision on the points on which the appeal is taken—
<pb#781/>
As it respects the right of the party to a preemption under the law, the decision of the Register and Receiver has been considered as conclusive under the law, and no enquiry is made at this Office, on what testimony it was granted—therefore no notice of this question was taken in my instructions, except such as was precautionary—
The law inexpress terms requires, inhabitation and cultivation previous to the 1* of January 1825, and if your own decisions on this point have been controlled by the Judge and persons admitted to the right of preemption under the law, who in your own opinion have no such right, you will of course cause an appeal to be taken from the decision of the Judge—And also in all those cases where under the control of the Judge you have granted Certificates for preemption in eighths of Sections. From the enclosed copy of my letter to the Secretary of the Treasury you will perceive that the question in relation to legal Representatives is considered as not a material one.”
With regard to the appeal taken in the case of Judge Duval, I do not understand whether it is taken on the part of the Land Officers, in behalf of the Gov" or for the benefit of the Territory, in either event however I am not sufficiently in possession of the facts, to give an opinion on the subject. I request to be informed of all the facts in relation to the selections & reservations of any quarter Sections for the use of the Territory either by the Governor of the same or by the Land Officers.”—

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to inform you, that on the 16” Ultimo I left this post in Company with Major General Gaines for Cantonment Brooke, and from thence travelled through the Country occupied by the Florida Indians, and through the frontier Settlements of Florida to Tallahassee and Sº Marks, where I embarked for this post;
and arrived on the 11* instant. I deem it unnecessary to say any thing about the localities or resources of that part of the Country occupied by the Indians through which we travelled, as doubtless you will receive a description of its resources as well as the situation of the Indians from General Gaines—On my arrival at Tallahassee
<pb#782/>
I had an interview with his Excellency Governor Duval on the subject of the Indian Outrages recently Committed on the Frontiers of Georgia. and Florida, and Communicated to him the arrangements I
was about to make, to Carry into Effect the views Contained in your Communication of the 4* Ult”,” A Copy of which I received in Tallahassee—These arrangements met the entire concurrence of his Excellency, and he assured me, that when Carried into effect that he felt Confident that they would give Protection and Security to the Frontier Settlements—On my arrival at this post, I had the honor to receive your Communication of the 6* Ultimo,” and I have Communicated to his Excellency Governor Troup, the arrangements made to protect the Frontiers of Georgia and Florida—and I now have the honor to inform you, that I have made the following distribution of the Troops placed under my Command, Wiz:-One Company has been Stationed near the Oscilla River with Orders to protect that Section of Country lying between Tallahassee and the Suwannee River—Two Companies near the Florida Agency, charged with the protection of the Country lying between the Suwannee and Sº Johns Rivers—Three Companies at Cantonment Brooke, with instructions to protect that part of the Indian frontier lying on the Gulph, and to prevent the Indians from passing into the Settlements through that Channel—The Commanding Officer at S*Augustine is charged with the protection of the Settlements East of the Sº Johns—The Commanding Officers of these several Post have received instructions to keep the Indians within their limits, unless they have a written permission signed since the 1* of January, 1827, by the Agent for Indian Affairs—On the arrival of the Company of the 4* Infantry from Orleans, I shall have four Companies of the 4* Infantry at this post, and shall hold them in readiness to march to the Frontiers of Georgia, or to whatever point their services may be required—
From all that I have been able to learn I feel Confident that there is no hostile intention on the part of either the Creek or Seminole Nation, nor the least Concert between them—The outrages and murders recently Committed in Georgia and Florida, were the Acts of a few desperate Outlaws, three of whom it is beleived, have already atoned for their Crimes, and efforts are making to have the others taken and brought to justice—

<place-time>SIR, I have the honor to inform you that after waiting at Milledgeville from Thursday 1* to Thursday 8* instant in the hope of receiving a dispatch containing the report of Andrew Ellicot & Don Estevan Minor made to Government by the former in 1800, which still appears to me to be the only authentic document upon which the present Comm” for runing the same Boundary line can proceed with entire satisfaction to themselves, as the result of those operations as far as it could then be obtained is obligatory and final, I repaired to this place. Having now a strong belief that the packet with its important inclosures has someway miscarried I have been engaged since Monday Evening the 12* inst., when I first saw Mr Spalding, in making arrangements for proceeding immediately to the performance of our duty. A copy of the proceedings necessary before actual commencement of the work, in the form in which they really took place between us, of questions reasonings and decisions will be forwarded to your</place-time>
<docbody><pb#784/>
department by the next mail.” The Georgia Commissioner by a negotiation with the Bank of Darien made upon Tuesday the 13*
inst, has provided the funds requisite for commencement, and it has been agreed that the work shall be performed at joint charge of the two Governments by a single party under control of the two Commº"
acting in conjunction with precisely equal powers. I had the good fortune to procure in Richmond the journal of Andrew Ellicot which is completely in detail, and was prepared by him for the press after the report was made. I have no hezitation under the actual circumstances to consider as entirely authentic what he there says was the result of the joint operations of the two Commissioners and the final agreement between them. I am allready assured of the complete ostensibility of the mark which Ellicot says in his journal was made in presence of the two Comm” by their joint order to designate the Eastern extremity of the line. We have nothing therefore to do but to run it so that it shall coincide as nearly as we can possibly make it with the present Geographical line, the arc of a terrestrial great circle, never yet traced and marked. From all the accounts hitherto received by us, the Ook-fon-ooka Swamp is absolutely impenetrable by men bearing compass and chain, without first opening a Vista and then making a foot bridge. We expect to have to depend upon a traverse as we are not authorized to proceed in that only complete but very expensive way. A competent surveyor could not be procured in Georgia for less than 8$. a day, all expences paid besides. I could have brought one from Virginia far superior to the best in this State for five dollars. Having with much pains satisfied myself fully of the thorough competency of the surveyor appointed by the authorities of Georgia, I have consented to accept of him, allthough he is not at all an astronomer and must proceed by geometrical means alone, unconnected by any astronomical operation, which may answer sufficiently well on the present occasion. His demand was ten dollars per diem but I cannot consent to give more than 4$ for his compendation from the United States. The men requisite will be engaged from one dollar a day to 20% the month, with the exception of two of a superior order whose services cannot be dispensed with. The whole provisions and other equipments must be procured in Savannah and steps are allready taken for that purpose. Nothing whatever can be had in or near the country through which the line runs, to which we shall be confined at least 3 months. We could not make our preparations even with a smaller sum than 1500$. Mr. Spalding
<pb#785/>
has procured a larger accomodation and there will be considerable saving from his success in that measure. We concur fully in the disposition and determination to use all possible oeconomy, and as necessary to that, all the dispatch possible consistent with accuracy.”

<place-time>[Referred February 19, 1827]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled.
The petition of the subscribers, resident inhabitants of the City of St Augustine, and the Eastern district of the Territory of Florida, respectfully Sheweth:
That your petitioners were all resident inhabitants of Florida at the period of its cession to the United States of America, and many of them natives of said County, but are not citizens of the United States either by birth or by naturalization under the laws of the United States.
That your petitioners have been impressed with the belief that in virtue of the 6* Article of the Treaty with Spain,” by which the Floridas were ceded to the United States, your petitioners were admitted to all the Civil and political rights and privileges of Citizens of the United States; but your petitioners have lately understood that this construction of the said treaty is not warranted by the Constitution of the United States.
Nevertheless your petitioners have confidently relied on the protection of the Government of the United States for perfect security in the enjoyment of their rights and privileges as such Citizens, equal and coextensive with those of native and naturalized Citizens, under the Constitution and laws of the United States.
But your petitioners, with the deepest pain and apprehension have just learned that the Legislative Council of this Territory on the 11”
day of January Instant, passed an Act entitled “An Act dividing the Territory of Florida into thirteen districts and providing for the elec-
<pb#788/>
tion of members of the Legislative Council” by the 8* Section of which Act your petitioners are deprived of the rights previously exercised by them, of voting at any election for members of the said Legislative Council.” And your petitioners are seriously apprehensive that the said Legislative Council will, at their present Session, also repeal that part of the Law of this Territory passed the 3” of July 1823, by which the right of Suffrage is expressly secured to your petitioners for deligate to Congress.”
Your petitioners cannot forbear to express their astonishment at this shameful outrage, on the part of the Legislative Council of this Territory, upon the rights and the feelings of the ancient inhabitants of Florida, and they confidently rely upon the justice and magnanimity of the Congress of the United States to interpose a barrier against so wanton and unmerited an Act of oppression.
Your petitioners pray, that Congress will, at its present session, pass an express and a definitive law, by which the elective franchise, in all cases in this Territory, shall be secured, beyond the control of the Legislative Council, to all resident inhabitants at the time of the Cession of Florida to the United States, and who, in other respects, shall possess the same qualifications to vote at elections, as those required from Native or naturalized Citizens of the United States.
And your petitioners will ever pray &c."—

<docbody>To THE HON” J. M. WHITE, of Florida, Ho: of Rep" U. S.
SIR, I have the honor in reply to your communication of [blank],”
made to the President of the United States, to state that the President is solicitous for the peace and safety of the Citizens of Florida;
and is anxious for the welfare of the Indians who reside there. He is of the opinion that both would be promoted by the removal of the latter to a Country more congenial to their habits, and better adapted to supply their wants. There are no means, however, at the disposal of the Executive for the promotion of such an object. But as it is believed from your statements from time to time made to the Department, that the Indians are themselves desirous of removing, it is considered that perhaps preliminary steps might be taken to embrace their views on the subject of removal, and the terms upon which they would agree to go. The President is entirely willing if it be your pleasure, to engage in the trust, to refer the procurement of such information, to you; * and if you shall find in the prosecution of this Trust that a few hundred Dollars are required, to pay the expense of agents in communicating with the Indians under your directions, your bills for as many as five hundred Dollars, drawn on the Department for such purpose will be paid.
Should it turn out that the Indians are willing to remove, the terms on which they may agree to go can be embodied and signed by them, and conditionally by you, when on their being received here, should they be approved, they can afterwards take a more formal shape and be embodied in a Treaty, the provisions for which will of course be referr'd as usual to the Senate, and the Means to carry it into effect to the Congress.
It is believed you would be safe in agreeing upon the following outline—First, a Country to be given in exchange North of Arkansas and West of Missouri, in suitable quantity, and to each Indian a
<pb#792/>
rifle, a Blanket, a Kettle, provision by the way; and for one year after they may arrive in their new homes.”---

<docbody>COL: ROB" BUTLER Surveyor G. Tallahassee SIR, I have now the satisfaction to transmit a paper containing copy of the act to provide for the confirmation and settlement of private land claims in East Florida and for other purposes.”
You will perceive that the 7” and subsequent sections of this bill, provides for the surveying and connecting with the township lines, the private confirmed claims, & for designating on the township plats, the unconfirmed claims over 3,500 acres, which have been filed with the Commissioners. The 7” Section of this act has invested you with extensive powers, & very responsible duties both executive and judicial—and for the due execution of which it will be indispensably necessary that you commit the surveying & laying down of the private claims, only to your most experienced & judicious Deputies, in the fidelity & judgement of whom, you have the most implicit confidence.—
My letter addressed to you on the 9th July 1824 *—with the Diagrams accompanying it, will have anticipated the necessity of any of any further instructions as it respects the mode of connecting the private surveys with the township lines, & giving to them and the public lands in each township the proper sectional number.
The Commission for deciding on the private claims in East Florida, being still open it will be unnecessary to take any immediate measures for surveying the claims in that district, which have heretofore been confirmed—Your labours at present, will therefore, be exclusively directed to the survey of the private confirmed claims in West Florida, and as these are not very numerous, and I beleive generally well defined and well known, I trust you will be able to have them completed in a reasonable time and without much difficulty—For this purpose I would recommend, that you divide West Florida, into such number of districts as you may deem expedient, by natural boundaries, * Answered post, p. 783.
<pb#793/>
that you assign a particular deputy to each of those districts, whose duty it shall be to survey the private claims and connect them with the township lines—That you give public notice of the name, residence and time that such deputy will attend in each particular section of the Country for the purpose of surveying the private claims, which notice should include a copy of the 7” & 12* Section of the act now forwarded.—
The 8* Section provides for the return of the surveys to the Register
& Receiver, this of course cannot be done until the township Plat be completed—The public lands therefore in each township should be Surveyed at the same time that the private claims within the same are surveyed, if the land be of that quality which it is deemed expedient to section off, and on this subject your deputies must be instructed by you—The 9” Section requires those claims which you may think improperly located or invalid from any cause, arising out of fraud or otherwise, to be disignated on your plat in the same manner & having the same sectional numbers as if they had been approved.
The 10* Sec: provides that the expence of surveying shall be paid by the public—there will be an appropriation of ten thousand dollars applicable to this particular object,” & which I presume will be sufficient to meet all demands for the present year—but should your expenditure necessarily exceed that amount, you will stipulate for the excess to be paid from the appropriation for 1828—The lines actually run between one private claim and another, or between a private claim and the public lands; should be but once charged, unless it be indispensably necessary to re-measure the same line twice, Your account for surveying, private claims will be kept seperate and distinct from that for surveying the public lands, and where a line is common to both, one half of the expence must be charged to each.
The 11* Sec: provides that no patents shall issue for interfering claims, until there shall have been a legal decision—In all cases therefore of interference between private claims, where there may be any doubt as to the priority of title, it will be prudent to run out all the lines of each, but in cases where there is no doubt, or where the parties agree it may be proper to designate the interference of the weaker claim only by dotted lines on the plat.
Under the provisions of the 12* Sec: you will take care to designate in the township Plats the claims referred to, so far as you are furnished with or can procure the means of doing so.
A remittance of five thousand dollars will be made you immediately after the appropriation is passed for surveying the private claims as referred to above.-
<pb#794/>
I would recommend that you proceed immediately to the survey of the private claims in the town and neighbourhood of Pensacola the Barancas and those on the opposite side of the Bay, and complete also the townships & fractional townships to which they may extend, that the public land within them may be brought into market and the private confirmed claims patented.”—

<place-time>INDIAN OFFICE FebX 27th 1827</place-time>
<docbody>CoL: THOMAS. L. M*KENNEY General Superintendant of Indian Affairs—
SIR, Your letter of the first " and third ins” ” was received last evening—I am much pleased at the prospect of the removal of the Indians from Florida; I believe it will be a fortunate and happy change for the Indians, and will certainly save the United States considerable expence, in maintaining them in this country—
With regard to the matters contained in your letter of the 3” Ins' I
have flattered myself that my accounts will be settled. The loss of which you speak if I must sustain it will only be one more sacrafice in addition to many I have incurred in the faithful and active discharge of my duties as an Officer. If my errors of judgement are to be paid for, it is my misfortune and must be submitted to-I have received a statement from the 2* Auditor by which I am placed as debtor to the United States for about $2,000 *—The Statement on its face is erronious in some particulars and the Vouchers as returned for ex-
<pb#796/>
planation, at least all but one (which it seems I must loose) can be easily explained.
I shall however come to the City as soon as a Secretary shall arrive here to take charge of the Government—I have no expectation of changing the determination of the Department in relation to my accounts by my visit, but my circumstances and situation require that a speedy termination, of the matter shall be made, which cannot be done by letter—I am greatly surprised that the returns of the issues of rations which I made with great care and attention to your Department have never been received—I transmitted to you some weeks since several receipts and my account with the vouchers of the expences of the Indian Department for the quarter ending the 31* of December 1826 I shall bring with me all the papers necessary to close my accounts, and where the Department has no power to decide on my appeal, I must either apply to the Attorney General or the President. It seems to me that I ought to be present to attend to this matter. An appeal to Congress may be necessary—but I think not—
I know that $5,00 is the Salary allowed to a Sub Agent, and his pay cannot exceed that sum, but if he is sent away to execute the public business, it cannot be expected he is to pay his travelling expences, nor is it reasonable or just that the labourers at the Agency out of the pittance allowed to them are te should board and find themselves—The Interpreter is no Salary Officer, and the Dep* will allow what is right—It seems to me where the Secretary is satisfied it was proper and right that a moderate provision should be made for these persons that their expences can be paid without violating any law, out of the contingent fund. If I am mistaken however and should have the opinion of the Attorney General against me I must bring the subject before Congress—
I am respectfully Your Obt Serv"

<place-time>Land Office, TALLAHASSEE 27* Feb. 1827.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5* Inst" enclosing Sundry depositions in support of the claim of Peter W. Gotier Jr to a preemption.
We regret to inform you that those depositions contain a very partial and uncandid Statement of the facts, which you will readily percieve from the enclosed copy of the testimony on which this claim was impeached and rejected.”
It is a fact notorious in this country, and one well known to M*
White himself, that Peter W Gotier Jr never did reside in this Territory It appears from the statement of Jacob Robinson that he owned one or more of the Negroes which were employed on his fathers plantation on Chipola, for which his father has actually obtained a preemption. It does not appear that Peter W Gotier Jr ever did either by himself or Agent make any seperate distinct or independant improvement from that of his father, and we are clearly of Opinion that he has not even the Shadow of a Claim to a preemption.
The claim of Gotier Sen' was only recognized by the most liberal construction of the law, for he never has lived resided in this Territory nor do we believe he is yet an inhabitant; but he had made extensive improvements and had been a Cultivator of the Soil.
Jacob Robinson and James Webb two of the witnesses on whose testimony the claim of Peter W Gotier was rejected are his personal and devoted friends. Robinson is one of the nearest Settlers to the place where he claims preemption, and well knew that the said Gotier never had been an inhabitant of this Territory within the terms of the Law We have no doubt you will be frequently troubled on questions of this kind; but we have the satisfaction to know that the documents on file in our office will support the correctness of our proceedings, and we believe that our Official conduct will bear the test of the most rigid scrutiny. Our errors (for no doubt we have committed many) have generally been in favor of the settlers claimants, and
<pb#798/>
we do not believe that we have ever rejected a claim which could have been sanctioned by the law.

<place-time>House, OF REPRESENTATIVES Feby [blank]* 1827.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. I have received the following intelligence from Florida &
as the representative of the interest of the institution for teaching the Deaf & Dumb of Ky. I beg leave to lay it before you and ask from
<pb#799/>
you a caveat against the emananation of a Patent to Jacob Robinson
& Peter W Gotier.” The preemption law passed April 18* 1826 °
had received a liberal construction from the Department, and the Register & Receiver. Claimants were however confined to an entire legal quarter Section and were not permitted to enter in eights of Sections and no claimant was permitted to enter in his own right, more than one quarter Section in virtue of this law, except in the case where two or more had Settled and improved a fractional quarter.
In such case they were permitted to have a division of the fractional quarter & each to purchase a quarter in addition. Such Settlers coming as was believed by the Register & Receiver within the Provision to the 3" Section of the pre-emption law, The law was executed in obedience to this construction until near the Close of the Office when Jacob Robinson of Chippola (and whose improvements are embraced by this location) brought a case by mandamus before the Judge of the Superior Court for the middle district of Florida, requiring the Register & Receiver to Shew cause and praying the preremtory mandate of the Court to Command Those officers to permit him to entertain his pre-emption. 1* in eights & 2* that where two or more have Settled on & improved the Same quarter Section though entire that they Should be entitled to a division of the quarter including their improvements and each to an additional quarter Section.
It was resisted by the officers and Council for the asylum in argument had before the Judge. In the course of which instructions from the department were produced which were clear & positive upon both points. It was insisted in argument that the term quarter Section had a determined Signification which was to be found in the Acts of Congress that in the use of the term Congress. had uniformly kept up the Same Signification, that it was intended to mean Something more than 160 acres of land that an equally important part of the Signification is the particular manner in which it is to be bounded as is Specifically Pointed out in the law. that the beginning to each quarter was given by the Surveyor—that two eights of the Same or different Sections was not a quarter Section within the meaning given by Congress to the term, that though the two eights would include the quantity yet boundary which is equally important under the law, was not complied with The Second Section of the law of 1813
to which the preemption law of this Territory refers was adverted to wherein it directs “The Same to be bounded by the Sectional lines
& the divisional lines &c.” ". It was also Shewn that it was possible
<pb#800/>
to obtain two eights adjoining which would be bounded on neither Side by a Sectional line. These arguments taken with positive instructions from the Department, it was contended Should be Sufficient to Sustain the negative of the first point made in the Case, particulary when it was recollected that a previous question had been made to wit whether the Superior Court, could righfully exercise a Superintendance & controul over these Officers and the Department in the execution of the pre-emption law or whether Congress had not made the Register & Receiver the Sole Judges as the law gave them the power to adjudicate claims pass upon testimony &c & had provided no appeal nor given to any jurisdiction a right to control them that they were Sworn officers and must execute the law according to their understanding of it; that it was necessary that he the Judge Should be entirely satifyed that he had the right to control or dictate to the officers in the discharge of their duties under this law and that the construction contended for by the applicant is clearly Correct to enable him to Sustain and enforce the position. As to the Second point, it is clear from the law itself that the case above alluded to was the only one under this law where the Claimant or Settler would be entitled to a preference in becomeing the purchaser of more than one quarter Section of land. To this it was answered that in case two or more had Settled upon the Same quarter that they were by the law entitled to a division of the Same to be made by the Register &
Receiver which division when made would give to each the fraction of a quarter and although the term fractional quarter Section had a technical meaning known and in use in the Surveying and other departments yet that this law was to be liberally construed against the government & in favour of the Settler and that the division above mentioned would bring those Settlers in the provision to the 3° Section of the pre-emption law and of this opinion was Judge Woodward—he gave his opinion for the Applicant on both points and gave the order for the pre-emptory mandamus to issue which was done and obeyed by the officer. I enclose a copy of the mandate as it issued in favor of Jacob Robinson and another in behalf of Peter W Gotier. I have felt it my duty to lay this matter before you
& in the name of the institution whose interest is likely to be affected to protest against Judge Woodwards decision " not only as unsound and indefensible upon the law itself but also against his assumption

It is desireable that the names of all streams should be put down on the township plats when they can be ascertained.
The accompanying diagram * represents the lines bordering upon the state of Alabama and marked as returned on your township plats: They represent Ellicotts line, the Alabama line, and the line of Gen' Coffees surveys (to which you were requested heretofore to connect your Surveys) as three distinct lines, will you be good enough to explain this, and to inform me which is the line that ought to be considered as the proper line between Alabama and Florida.”

SIR, I rec" by the last mail yº" of 15” Ult.* advising me that Mr Allen had executed his bond & requiring mine. I hope by this time, that my bond has been received at y' office.” I sent it enclosed to Col. White of Florida, about the 1* of Feb’. With my reasons, for thus long delaying it. I requested he would lay them before you, &
they are simply these—My bond as you will see by its date was executed in ten days after its reception—You required in yº letter of Instructions that the Solvency of the Securities, should be certified before the District Judge, or Attorney for the U. S. Now Sir the Judge lived nearly 200 miles from me, & the Attorney, to see whom, I rode to Richmond had left that place for the Springs—I came on here then, meaning to write to W* for Certificates to satisfy the Judge of this District—When I received Colo White's letter announcing the Statement of Mr Allen to you, that I had given no bond, when he knew to the contrary, I was fortunate enough, to discover that the former District Attorney at this place, knew the Securities to my bond, & had no hesitation, in qualifying to their sufficiency—The bond, I hope is long since with you, & I trust, that with this plain Statement of facts you will direct my drafts, for the three quarters of Salary, now due, & protested, to be paid—Will you be good enough at the same Time, to advise me in what manner & at what time, I may draw in future, to prevent the recurrence of so painful an event?
As the law has passed, giving to the board of Register & Reciever

<docbody>HON HENRY CLAY Secry of State SIR I rec" by the last mail a communication from the Department of State,” accompanied by a petition * which I herewith return The communication requires me to “prepare and transmit to the Department of State as soon as practicable such report of the case suggested in the petition as will put the President in possession of the facts necessary to a correct decision upon the application of the petitioner”
<pb#813/>
The application to his Excellency was entirely irregular, and must have originated in misconception. The Bond in question was given in 1822, under a Law of the Territory, authorising the appointment of Keepers of the public Archives, and was of course made payable to the Governor & his successors. Maria Machado was one of the sureties of the present Keeper of the Archives upon this Bond, which, however, expired by the operation of the act of Congress passed 3d March 1825, requiring that officer to give Bond in a penalty of twenty thousand Dollars. and authorising the President to commission him M" Caro is a faithful intelligent & valuable officer. I have no reason to believe that madame Machado had the least ground to apprehend any mismanagement in his office. About the time when the petition purports to have been drawn a family feud existed between M* Caro and one of his brothers which I suppose must have been the occasion of the application in question *

Yº letter of the 16" ult” is recº". The contents of a letter are always sacred; & a violation of the franking privilege therefore is not easily detected. If a letter is franked by or to an officer of governm" having that privilege, the presumption is that its enclosure, if it have any, refers to the business of the person under whose name it is franked, or to the business of his office. Nor can the contrary be shown without a violation of the most sacred obligation, by invading the Sanctity
<pb#815/>
of a letter. If “letters are mailed at y' office addressed to persons entitled to receive them free,” when you can discover that they enclose letters to persons who are not entitled to that privilege, you cannot ascertain, without an unlawful investigation, that the enclosures are not on the business, personal or official, of him under whose frank they are conveyed. The law provides, that in case of improper enclosures of letters, it shall be the duty of the person to whom they are enclosed to correct the error by returning them to the P. O. to be marked with postage; & the fulfilment of this duty must be confided to his own sense of propriety & moral obligation. When this is not done, the fair presumption is, that their franks cover nothing but what is the proper subject of their franking privilege; & on this, it is safest to let the subject rest.”

7000$. There can be no doubt but this amount has been applied by you to the purposes of your Agency—but it is equally certain that it has been so applied without Authority. I need not add that such a mode would soon involve the Department in inextricable difficulties.
It can best judge, and alone jude, what can be sent for the purposes of each Agency, but if remittances for other objects are used in addition the consequences would soon become serious. I really (if the re-imbursement of the appropriation for the school has not been made)
do not know what course to take. It would be extremely gratifying to releive the case of its embarrassment, and I would cheerfully do it, if I knew how. The same difficulty exists in regard to the remittance for stock cattle.
The subject, in essence is this, (supposing your accounts to shew a disbursement to the amount—of all the remittances—) There has been used for the Indian Department, through you and for your Agency, 7,000.3 more than was intended by the Department—The remedy is, and this is the only one known to me, to withhold part of the usual remittances for contingences until these sums are reimbursed, when the money can be applied in the one case (the 6000$. for the stock cattle) and reimbursed to the school appropriation in the other.
In pursuance of this plan 1000 dollars of the 1860 that would have been remitted to you under the apportionment for the first half of this year, for your contingences, is withheld, and will be paid towards the apportionment for stock cattle to the person claiming it. This will leave you 860 dollars for your contingences to include your pay for the half year—which being, (including Office rent) 425. will leave for contingences for the first half year 435 dollars.
If however you have reimbursed the 1000.8 as directed, this amount
1000$ will be remitted, on your giving this information.
I know no way to releive you from the dilemma in which you have placed yourself in applying remittances for specific cases, to other objects, and hope it may be agreeable to you.”

We believed him entitled to enter in the first instance but appealed that the Council might have an Opportunity of prosecuting the Appeal if it should so decide.
By an Act of Congress approved May 4, 1824 " the Governor of the Territory was authorized to select the quarter section of Land adjoining Tallahassee to be reserved for the use of the Territory.

SIR, I am directed by the Secretary of War to enclose to you a copy of a letter addressed by Col" Humphreys the Agent, to me,” and to call your attention to the Act of the Legislature of Florida to prevent Indians roaming at large &* * as referred to by—Col" Humphreys.
I am directed to state that it is hoped under the present state of excitement and the wretchedness of these people, that this act will not be enforced. Exceptions may be very properly taken to it on other grounds. It can hardly be conceived that the Indians would submit to the chastisement contemplated by the act, without seeking to be revenged. Out of this, feeble as they are, and for that very reason appealing to the sympathies of the Government and people, not of Florida only but, of the U. States—they might afflict the citizens of the Territory, in the destruction of many lives, whilst the occasion of their excitement and revenge might make it less a matter of concern with every body. It will therefore be best to avoid on your part, (by refraining to execute the provisions of the Act,) being the cause of an excitement the issue of which cannot be foreseen.
It is hoped, however, apart from such conjectures as these, that the present miserable and perishing condition of these people may induce, in the citizens of Florida dispositions of forbearance and kindness, 70 Ante, p. 734.

The line soon entered a swamp of such extent that although completely seperated from the great Okfonooka by a narrow and low but dry isthmus covered with long leaved pine and fan Palmetto it did not emerge under 15 miles.—In a few chains under 30 miles the Suwany river was crossed without making an offset, and there is now no ground to apprehend that such an interruption in the work will take place on any part of the Line except in the case of ponds too deep to pass but beyond which the Signals can be distinctly seen.—The Line misses the Suwantichée, but intersects the Alāpāhāw and Withlacóoche branches of the Suwany river—Of the chain of Lakes lying on this part of the Line all except this, near which we now are, will be in Georgia, some of the others are
10 or 15 miles in circumference. This is a mile long and not much less in width, with transparent waters and dry banks, in the midst of a fertile country, with scenery truly picturesque and highly beautifull. Of the climate I can say nothing more than that since the 25" day of January, when I entered South Carolina, there has been an uninterrupted continuance of the finest Spring weather I ever witnessed in my life, with no more rain than what has afforded a variation as agreeable as necessary to vegetation I have not had the honour as yet to receive any communications from your department since I left Richmond, but trust that I may nevertheless, before I reach the Chatahooché, be gratified with the answer I have so long and so much desired to my application from Albermarle early in December for a copy of the report made by Ellicot and Minor in 1800.* As yet I cannot myself say what resolution I shall take as to marking the line permanently, if I remain unprovided with that important document, which must have been lost in the endeavor to transmit it to me by mail. I shall go to Talahassee from the nearest point of the line to that place with the hope of finding the important communication there—I have strong hopes that the line now runing will terminate so near to the western extremity of the true boundary that the return line will soon coincide with it; in which case we have no more to do than to make a small mound at each of the mile stakes allready erected and inscribed with the distance as the Line has advanced. The last operation will be to continue the boundary eastward untill untill it reaches the Sº Marys river.—The two most important geographical facts allready ascertained are, that the head Spring of the Sº Marys lies to the South of the point where the line will intersect that river, * Randolph's letter of Dec. 16, 1826, embodied such a request (NA,OIA, Lets.
Recd., Ga., printed, H. Exec. Doc. 140, 20 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 6–7; H. Doc. 43, 22 Cong., 1 sess., p. 19; and S. Misc. Doc. 25, 33 Cong., 2 sess., p. 206). See ante, p. 518.
<pb#828/>
and that no part of the great Okefonooka Swamp lies in Florida.
Ellicot and Minor appear to have made a judicious compromise for a straight line from the mouth of the Flint river passing through the point designated as the head of S' Marys would certainly cut off a slip of territory lying on the South side of Sº Marys river and the North side of the Line.”

<docbody>LIEUT HARVEY BROWN Asst. Q Master St Augustine.
SIR, An act of Congress approved on the 2° instant, of which I
enclose you a copy, makes an appropriation of eleven thousand dollars for “opening and repairing the public road in Florida, known by the name of the King's Road from the Georgia line, by St Augustine to New Smyrna”,” and the order of the 22° instant, from General Head quarters, directs the Commanding General of the Western Dept., to employ the disposable force, at the most convenient stations, in the Execution of this work.” You are charged with the Superintendence
86 See post, p. 837.
87 4 STAT. 227–228.
88 The pertinent portion of this order (no. 17) reads: “4. The Commanding General of the Western Department will direct the disposable force, at the most convenient Stations, to be employed in opening and repairing the ‘public road in the Territory of Florida known by the name of the Kings Road, from the Georgia line, by St: Augustine, to New Smyrna;' and, in
‘opening the Communication between Mochetto or Halifax, and Indian Rivers, in the line of communication to Cape Florida,’ conformably to the Act of the 2nd of March, 1827. The General Superintendence of this road, will devolve on the Assistant Quarter Master who may be assigned to that duty.
<pb#829/>
of the operations connected with it, and will, when the means are furnished you, commence the work and prosecute it with all practicable economy and despatch—The track of the old road, it is presumed, is, for the most part, sufficiently wide already—The law is silent on this point—The road, should, however, be wide enough at all places, to admit of the ordinary vehicles passing each other on the route—In other respects, the face of the Country through which the road passes, will indicate the kind of work and finish which should be bestowed upon it, to render it durable and passable at all seasons; but you must distinctly understand that the appropriation is not be exceeded.”
By the same act of Congress, the sum of Five thousand dollars is appropriated for the Construction of a bridge across the St Sebastians River, on the military road leading from Pensacola to St Augustine.
This object also, is confided to your superintendence, but it must be executed by contract—with a view to economy you will invite proposals for this work, having previously conferred with the Mayor of St Augustine as to the particular description of bridge which is necessary—But in the formation of a Contract you will bear in mind, that the sum appropriated is under no circumstances to be exceeded.—Nor will a contract be concluded until the right of way be secured—This it is understood from Captain Burch, was denied to him, on a former occasion, on both sides of the river—It must not be purchased now—
if it is not given by the holders or bought and transferred by the City authority, the bridge cannot be commenced until you first report to this Department and receive further instructions.”
I am Sir &"
<pb#830/>
Some of the claims under the preemption law " have been impeached, and will be perhaps finally rejected: but I have thought it best to report the whole for the present, and inform you hereafter of such as may be rejected. I have to renew my former request that no patent may be issued to any of the claimants under that law for some time.” The impositions which have been practiced under the law will ultimately be detected, and we may have an opportunity of correcting the evil.
In my last I mentioned that my deposites during the month of February were near 70,000 dollars. This estimate was correct, but a small part of that sum is not reported in my accounts, in consequence of not having yet received the receipts of the Bank for the amount”

<docbody>LT F D. NEWCOMB A. A. Q Master Cantonment near Wantons SIR, Your communication of the 1* Ulto,” has been received, accompanied by your reports for the month of February.
Both the Secretary of War and the Q" Master General are absent from the City—But, as the opening of a road from your position to the Ocklawaha, and the improvement of the navigation of that stream from the point where the road shall strike it, to its junction with the St John's river, appear to be objects of great importance with reference to the transportation of the supplies for Maj Glassel's Command,” I
feel it to be my duty, in the absence of higher authority, to authorize the work. You will confer with Major Glassel on the subject, and request of him a detail of the requisite force, to accomplish the contemplated work at as early a period as practicable:–And as the suggestion appears to have met his approbation, it is not doubted, that he will render every facility in his power, consistent with a proper regard to the other objects confided to him.
The troops who shall be engaged on this work, will be entitled to the usual allowances in such cases.—
In answer to your enquiry in relation “to the materials that will be allowed for quarters”, I can only remark, that, situated as you are, it is impossible to send materials to you; and, that being supplied with tools and nails, it is presumed, the mechanics of the command, are competent to procure the necessary timber, and construct such buildings as would answer the purpose at a temporary position.
Before you bestow any labor upon the Ocklawaha, it will be proper
1° Answered post, p. 824.
<pb#838/>
to examine it carefully, from the point where the road is proposed to intersect it, to its mouth, in order to ascertain whether it will, with the improvements suggested, answer the object in view. The necessity for this however, will depend upon the present state of your information on the subject; but I would remark, that nothing short of personal observation should be relied upon.
On the accomplishment of the work, a cargo of supplies will be sent from some of the depots on the East side of the Peninsula, according to the arrangements of the Subsistence Department.
Be pleased to report fully on this subject, in the course of your operations.” -

<docbody>TO THE REGISTER AND RECEIVER at Tallahassee GENTLEMEN I now return seven Certificates for Preemption rights which were issued under writs of Mandamus, if there are any others similarly situated which have been forwarded by you to this office you will be pleased to designate them, & they shall be returned—
Those now returned embrace two distinct questions arising under the provisions of the act granting Preemption rights in Florida—The first is whether the qr: Section granted under the 1* Section of the act " shall be confined to sectional lines, and the second is whether under the provisions of the 3" Section of the act, any person is entitled to more than the quantity of one quarter Section except in those cases where two or more persons are settled on a fractional qr Section.—On both these points it is believed that Judge Woodward has given a decision not in conformity to the letter of the law, and the issuing of the Patents for those Certificates is suspended for the present *—Due respect however must be paid to the decisions of the court, and as you have now lost the opportunity of appealing from such decision in those particular cases, it is deemed proper to take no other measures at present than that of merely suspending the issuing of the Patent under an expectation that similar cases may probably occur on which you will avail yourself of an appeal, the issue of which appeal will decide the course which the Executive will take in relation to the cases on which Patents are suspended.
The Certificates now returned will therefore remain with you untill further instructed in relation to them. It will however be proper to reserve from sale, the half quarter sections which the parties respectively in your opinion would be entitled to, should the decision of Judge Woodward be ultimately overruled—If no other cases should occur, the probability is that, Patents will be issued on the Certificates now returned.”

<pb#843/>
On the subject of the law passed by the late Legislative Council of Florida to prevent the Indians roaming at large through the Territery Country. This law has never been executed in any instance to my knowledge, by any Citizen of this Territory. The parties of friendly Indians who have been sent by the Chiefs into Our settlements to bring home their wanderers have in a few instances flogged their own people who have disobeyed their laws. The Chiefs have repeatedly requested me, to have the wandering Indians who Came into Our settlements without permission taken up and flogged—this was never done, but the law is well Calculated to restrain the bad Indians within their limits They are apprised of it, and so far, without pressing its execution it has had the effect intended I regret that the Agent without knowing the facts, (for he has but recently returned to Florida) should have stated that the late murder near Tallahassee was Occasioned by the head of the family' having whipped an Indian to death—The fact is M. Carr. whose family was murdered had not been at home for many weeks before the murder and was absent at the time and did return for several weeks after—
I never heard of this statement before and the Agent has taken it only on idle rumour—If I am permitted to express my own Opinion as to the exciting cause which produced the late murders in Georgia &
Florida—I would say it sprang from the belief On the part of the Indians that some persons in Georgia had stolen their horses—they certainly lost some horses in the vicinity where they murdered the two men in Georgia, And threatened to take satisfaction for their loss.
The Agent has suffered his feelings to mislead his judgment And really has mistaken the facts.
I hesitate not to aver, that the Citizens of Florida have evinced more good, humane, feeling, patience, and forbearing towards the Indians under severe loss' And frequent insult, than I ever witnessed in any frontier Country.
These people had been indulged so much that they became wanton and insolent. Fed at every white mans house where they called, they mistook humanity for fear, and for kindness and hospitality paid them by robbing their houses And fields and killing their Cattle.
The great body of the nation have always behaved properly; but can it be expected, when the Seminole nation is formed in part of the outlaws of the Surrounding tribes, that such men can be governed in any other manner than by force I have never been considered as deficient in humanity—No man in my situation ever took more pains or trouble than myself to protect and Civilize these unfortunate people; but long experience has satisfied me that too much kindness is as fatal to their happiness as too much severity. There is no Consideration that could induce me to suffer
<pb#844/>
the Indians to be cruelly treated—I owe it the Character of my Government, to say nothing of my own, to see them justly And Kindly treated.

<docbody>Co! THOMAS L M*KENNEY Gen.' Super" of Indian Affairs SIR I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 20" of March 1827 *—and in answer to the same I state that the remittence made on the 28° of January 1825 of $1000 appropriated by Treaty for the School for the Florida Indians never came to my hands; * but was received by the late Actg. Gov. Co' Walton, as it appears from the Books in my Office, a Copy of his receipt to Thomas T Tucker Esq.' *
is herewith transmitted to you The Six thousand dollars included in the remittence made to me on the 17* day of August 1824 * for the purchase of Stock Cattle was accounted for by me at the proper Department and the account adjusted when I was in Washington in February 1825.
You are mistaken when you Suppose that either of the Sums mentioned were used by me for the Agency—You will find that not One dollar of either Sum was Appropriated by me for the Agency.
The $6000 was used in paying for the Indian Improvements, which was fixed by the Treaty at $4.500. Eight hundred dollars more was expended in the purchase of Stock Cattle for the Appalachicola Indians And the balance went in the payment for rations.
The $4.500 intended to pay for the Indian Improvements had not at that time been remitted And as it was highly important that the
<pb#845/>
Indians Should remove to the Country they were to inhabit in time to raise a Crop for the year 1825, And as they Confidently expected to be paid for their improvements before their departure from their homes, the $6000 was Applied as I have stated—If it had not been so applied at the time; the Indians would not have removed unless Compelled by force—Maj. Chaires was only entitled to $5,200 of the
$6000—for $800 as I have stated was paid by myself for the Stock Cattle furnished to the Appalachicola Indians—If then, the late Actg Governor Walton had paid Maj Chaires the $4.500 which he received for Indian Improvements, And which had been Settled for by me;
but $700 would then have been due to Maj Chaires for the Cattle he furnished for the Indians And which Sum Should have been taken from the Appropriation for rations. I believe you will find from the Account as Settled by me for the year 1824, at least that Sum was paid for rations furnished by Capt M Crupper & Maj Chares over and above the remittence actually made to me at that date for this specific object.” I am entirely Sensible of the difficulties which must result in closing the accounts with te the Department if the Sum allowed for a Specific object, is exceded or improperly applied; but Surely the Government would have Considered me as acting most Strangely, if I delayed the Payment for the Indian improvements with Six thousand dollars in my hands, when the Cattle too, were not delivered nor ready for delivery, And when the delay might have Occasioned the detention of the Indians in this quarter for Some time. I enclose to you the several receipts of Co' Walton for money he received during my absence from the Territory.
All the difficulty in the case is that I have Applied one specific appropriation to Another object more pressing at the time, and equally specific; but not as you Suppose for the use of the Agency, but actually in Accordance with the Treaty—All which I Could demonstrate to your Satisfaction if I could visit Washington City “
I am respectfully Your Obt Servt.

SIR, Yours of the 26th of March “is rec'd, and I enclose a Copy of mine of the 8th March last,” lest the original may have miscarried My wish is to get all the private claims in West Florida Surveyed and returned in the course of this year & the ensuing winter. It would not I think be expedient to commence the surveying of these private claims, or to extend the Surveying of the Public Lands in East Florida until the final confirmation by Congress of the reports of the Commº
which will I presume be had at the next Session.—
You will please put the Reg' at St Augustine in immediate possession of the Township plats of those Lands which have been sectioned off in that Land Dist. It is possible, though I think not probable, that there are some persons settled within the limits of those surveys, who may be entitled to preemptions & who wish to enter them.
Should the surveying of the Private claims in West Florida exceed
$10.000. the excess must be paid from the appropriation of 1828.”

<docbody>HON JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War SIR I have the honor to inform you that all the Indians with the exception of one called Billy who resides in the Creek nation, that are alive and concerned in the late murders committed in Georgia and Florida, are prisoners.” They were taken by a detachment from the command of Capt F L Dade and a party of warriors Sent by the Agent Col Humphreys under the command of Neamathla a chief who was on a visit to you last Spring, with the other Chiefs from Florida—
Three other Chiefs, and ten warriors assisted Neamathla; their conduct deserves praise and reward. These chiefs have requested me to represent the Services of themselves and warriors to the President of the United States—They Say that for the last three months they have been actively engaged in Seeking the offenders, that they have Suffered many privations and encountered great fatigue in apprehending the murderers. And pray that compensation may be made to them; The three chiefs deserve notice and it Submitted to your judgement if it would be proper to Send Elukee, Mathla Tuchab chee Harjo and the Yellow Snake each a medle—I hope that you will consent to compensate these Chiefs and their followers.
The prisoners were found on an Island near the Sea cost where they had planted corn and perhaps never would have been taken but for the Skill and management of the Indians who trailed them to their hiding place—They Surrounded the prisoners and took them by Surprise no resistance was made—but the chiefs were Solicitous to put them to death according to their own laws—this I had expected
<pb#849/>
and took measures to prevent. The prisoners are in custody and will be tried according to our laws”

<docbody>TO MAJ" BENJAMIN CHAIRES, SIR, I have received your letter of the 11" Ins” enclosing Col"Humphrey's Certificate—the latter I have referr'd to the 2* Auditor.”
In regard to your claim for the Stock Cattle, you are aware that it
<pb#852/>
was remitted to Governor Duval the 17* August, 1824,” to be applied to that purpose; and that there remains therefore no specific appropriation out of which to pay it.—Governor Duval, it appears, applied this remittance to the purposes of his Agency, in the press of demands upon him, at that time:-He made it a part of his Contingencies. The only remedy in the power of the Department, the specific appropriation being closed, by the remittance made to Governor Duval as Stated, is to retrench the allotment for his Contingencies in such sums as may be possible, so as not to embarrass the Indian Department in Florida, overmuch—and thus repay, to the object of the Specific appropriation, the amount diverted from it by Governor Duval. I told you I should recommend this course to the Secretary of War. He approved it as being the best that could be done, but feeling at the same time the direct obligation to pay you at once, were there means to do so, at his disposal.
In pursuance of this plan, there has been deducted One Thousand Dollars, from the allotment for Governor Duval's agency for this year, and on a special requisition the Secretary has directed that sum to be remitted to him, for you. You will receive it on calling on him for it.”—
I have the honor &c. &c. THO" L. MCKENNEY.

SIR. My letter to you of the 13* inst " was not designed to insinuate a Suspicion of your having improperly sought to ascertain the contents of letters, for no Such Suspicion existed. You had very properly communicated what appeared to you a violation of the franking privilege; and my answer was designed to advise you of the probability of a mistake on that point, since it is not certain that the enclosure may not relate to the business of the person who gives the frank.-
In stating that this cannot be known without violating the Sanctity of a letter, there is no implication intended, but it is simply to Shew that a person may be under a mistake when it would appear to him that the law was violated. I am not certain that officers of the Treasury Department have not violated this privilege; but from the difficulty which exists of obtaining full proof, of the fact, and from the responsibility of their Station, it seems more Safe to presume that they are not in the habit of transcending the bounds of the law.”

respectfully solicit the indulgence of the Genl. in Chief whilst I correct an Error which does much injustice to myself as well as the Governor of Florida. After failing to get into the Mouth of the Suwannee River I returned to St Marks, disembarked my Compy and communicated with the Governor at Tallahassee in person as to what was to be done. I suggested the propriety of spedily taking position at or near the ferry on the Suwannee. He agreed with me but believed that my stay there would be short as both himself and Col. Clinch had recommended a removal of the Compy. to the Agency or its Vicinity. I returned to St Mark on the 17* Nov" and on the
18° took up the line of march. On the 24* I reached the Suwannee, and selected such a position on its Eastern bank as in my Judgment was the most eligible in obedience to Order Nº. 61. of the 22" Inst.”
The position was not designated by the Govenor of Florida. That it was the most eligible one, that could be selected on that Suwahha river and was not only calculated, but did go far “to repress Indian excursions and restrain them within their Limits” I can establish by the evidence of the Citizens of Florida amongst whom I am serving, by the Sub.Agent of the Seminole Indians by Col.

<docbody>LIEUT COLONEL PERRAULT Topg| Engineer SIR In order to complete the operations respecting the connexion of the Atlantic with the Gulf of Mexico, it is necessary that the country between Lake George and the Bay of Tampa should be examined; it is also necessary to sound the channel of S' John's river from the mouth of Black creek to and including Lake George.
You are, therefore, requested to designate those of the officers under your command for the performance of these duties.
Two will accompany the Board from Sº Augustine to Tampa Bay;
and assist them in the selection of the best ground which country might present to the location of a canal route between S' Johns
<pb#862/>
river and Tampa Bay. On their return to Sº Augustine these two officers will determine, by running a line of levels, the elevation of the summit ground, in this direction, above the Gulf of Mexico.
The third officer will sound the channel of Sº John's river from the mouth of Black creek to the head of Lake George. The width of the channel, its course; the width and winding of the river shall be determined at sight, and a sketch made of the river. When these officers and the party now engaged in the reconsideration of the Santa fe and Suwanee route shall have completed the duty assigned to them, you will leave S*Augustine; repair to the seat of Government and there, with your Brigade, plot the work, and write your general descriptive Memoir which is to accompany the surveys.
It is desirable that every officer who has been intrusted by you with a separate survey should furnish you with a memoir giving all the information which he has been able to collect during the performance of his work, and which might have any bearing on the contemplated object.
I have the honour to be, Sir, very respectfully Signed BERNARD B" Gen! Memb B" of Int' Impvt."

<docbody>TO/MAJOR GEN" ALEX MACOMB Chief Engineer SIR Capt Poussin * and myself have just returned from the Gulf of Mexico, having completed the examination of the country between Sº Mark and this place. This second excursion across the Peninsula was made with a view to ascertain the degree of practicability of a route of Canal thro’ the Suwanee Santa-fe and Black creek. We were accompanied by Lieutenants Swift, Searl,” Canfield* & Huger*
who had surveyed the route under examination.
We propose to leave this place tomorrow to reconnoitre the country between the heads of S" John's river and Tampa Bay in order to test the comparative advantages of a route in this direction with the routes pointed out in our former instructions.
The third excursion is expected to be still more arduous than the preceeding one, but the importance of the object in view demands that we should spare no exertions to render the examination of the
<pb#863/>
Peninsula as complete as our present means can permit.”

<place-time>MILLEDGEVILLE May 15. 1827.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have had the honour to transmit to you by mail three several packets containing the communications made by the Governor of Georgia to the Comm' of that State while we were upon the line, and a correspondence between the two Commº" which took place upon the suggestion of M* Spalding who declared that he deemed that formality necessary.” In consequence of the last communication from Governour Troup all further proceedings stoped on the 26*
April; the Comm' of the United States being entirely unprovided with means to continue them, or any accrediting testimonial which might have supplied the place; which he regrets the more, from the conviction he is under that the result would have been accepted by the Legislature of Georgia and a final Boundary established without that additional expence which has been by the interference rendered unavoidable. The expenditure made on this occasion has proved much greater than any one expected, but it is manifest that the U.S. Comm' could have no control over it, and that he could not do otherwise than submit to the judgement of the Com" of Georgia upon every question of that nature, for the alternative was allways to require the Com’ of Georgia to submit to him, who was much less qualified to judge of such things in Georgia. Much might have been saved by bringing out one half at least of the party from Virginia, as was proposed. In that case the work would have been completed, and a new investigation for the head of the Sº Marys made, which the two comm” had indeed agreed to make when they arrived at the Eastern end of the line; that of the U.S. having proposed to take the responsibility upon himself of concurring, from the entire conviction that the result would thoroughly support the view taken by Congress.
By crossing the Sº Marys at Ellicots mound above and below on horseback repeatedly, while Mr. Spalding had crossed it only once upon a log, I had satisfied myself of the accuracy of Ellicott and Minor. Immediately above the mound B. the river could not be navigated in a canoe, for it is a narrow rivulet in the middle of a wide
<pb#864/>
bog, while immediately below, all in sight of B, if the ground was cleared of trees & shrubs, it is a river boatable for 15 tons. above it came to my horses knees: below, half way up the saddle skirts, at the same time. It is true that following the course of the greatest length of one of the swamps which supply the river you will go southwardly a little, and that swamp after rains has a perceptible motion in its Waters, but another swamp trends West, and is much more extensive, with much the greater part of its extent on the North of our line.
The question made by Georgia now is too trifling in my opinion to have produced those consequences which the ferment excited about Milledgeville, I conclude, has rendered expedient. A letter from a Secretary of War in 1819 authorized Georgia to expect a new investigation to determine the exact locality of the head of Sº Marys.” The expression used is “the acquisition of the Floridas may change the character of the Boundary” But that investigation was really made by Georgia in 1819, and the report concludes in these words, “we are therefore of opinion that Mr. Ellicott and the Spanish deputation were correct in establishing on the Northern branch the point of demarcation between the State of Georgia and the province of East Florida” The question now made did not occur to the three Commº"
of 1819, all appointed by Georgia. This correspondence will be found in the Department of War, and the report as communicated by Governor Rabun.” It is proposed here to send a Georgia Surveyor to search for the head of the River.” I cannot omit to declare my
<pb#865/>
sentiments in regard to this proposal, that they may not be unknown when that case comes up hereafter. Whoever he may be, he will not venture to give an opinion adverse to the public wishes, if the excitement in the public mind should be considerable at the time upon the question, which is not the case now generally, I am very sure, for many more persons have expressed their regret at the interruption than the contrary. Yet, no doubt, by taking a dry time a survey may be made of the rivulet runing into S' Mary's near the mound and the point determined geographically where it ceases to be a rivulet and becomes a bog, supposing the astronomical results of Ellicott by which the Geographical position of the mound has been determined to be correct. and their verification by a practical astronomer furnished with perfect instruments and allowed several weeks at each extremity of the line ought not to be omitted on such an occasion. With respect to the Western extremity enquiry should then be made whether a point in the bed of the river, rarely ever uncovered there, has not been taken for the junction, one mile or more south of the cape or head land forming the point of the fork, where the banks of the two rivers unite, and their waters join, except in very uncommon dry seasons. Cypress and other aquatic trees grow all over the bed of the rivers to the south, and their streams are seen meandering through them. That is the case with Suwany, where it is very rapid. I must be permitted to declare my opinion that if Georgia and the United States were to leave the geometrical operations precisely as they now stand, it would give general satisfaction hereafter. If the line run Westward on this occasion as far as the Wythlacóochè 68 miles, and the line run Eastward to the same, 93 miles, with the short course of river between were adopted as the permanent boundary, there could not be any dissatisfaction on either side, now or hereafter; and no further expence would be requisite.
One straight line will intersect the Wythlacooche more than once, and will leave small portions of Florida on its North, and like fragments of Georgia on the South, forming fractional parts upon a general survey of no value whatever. These two lines are sufficiently marked as they are now; the first here mentioned by mile stakes numbered, and the second by five mile hillocks, made with a hoe, and both, well, by blazing trees on both sides.
When the party broke up, the majority proceeded to Darien with the provisions which remained, while the Commissioner and secretary with the surveyor chain carriers and signal bearers, set out directly by the head of the Allapaha a branch of Suwany river, and the south bend of Altamaha for Milledgeville. I accompanied those of course, with the view first to close the commission and get copies of all documents, and next to obey the order of the Department issued from the office of
<pb#866/>
Indian affairs under dates of December and February last in regard to the claims of Baley and Brodnax” for supplies furnished to the friendly Creek Indians who had been expelled from their country when McIntosh" was assassinated. When we arrived at the Altamaha, the waters of Oakmulghee were so high that it could not be crossed, and we had to make our way, after separating from the Surveyor and his men, along its banks for 50 miles up to the ferry at Hartford, before we arrived at which we had numerous creeks to pass by wading up to the shoulders, on account of the unsoundness of their bottoms, and were thereby delayed untill the night of the 6*. On the morning of the 10* the commº" separated. I have a copy of the account of expenditure but I have as yet received nothing from the Surveyor, for whose residence in Putnam County I shall set out tomorrow, being sure of concluding today the business devolved on me from the office of Indian affairs. Here I may be allowed to inform you that the Creek Indians of the party friendly to the United States are at this time allmost starving, the only subsistence of men women and children being the root of a kind of Bamboo called here China briar, the Smilax Pseudo-China of the Botanists, which is rendered esculent only by a tedious preparation and has not—nutritive virtue enough to save the lives of their children, all of whom will probably perish without immediate relief from the United States, as most of those of the Seminoles in the Peninsula of Florida have allredy done from want of wholesome food. No other aid from the United States than the issue of one peck of Corn a head per week would be necessary or expedient. Brigadier General Ware” of the Georgia Militia would be the best person to address to on this occasion if it should be resolved to do any thing in this case of the utmost possible wretchedness into which their civil broils have brought the part of the Nation allways faithfull to the United States. I have no doubt that the whole Creek Nation could be easily prevailed upon now to consent to move over the Mississippi, and the Seminoles will gladly share their destinies at this time. But a special mission from the President, best perhaps composed of the Military of some rank, will be necessary on the occasion in my opinion. Nothing is likely to be done unless the authority be so new and of such dignity as to render useless or vain and unavailing in result all factious contrivances to thwart the views of Government from illwill to the Agents employed by it. These savages are as credulous & indicisive as they are ignorant & capricious.
9. J. H. Brodnax.
<pb#867/>
With them idle tales or malicious representations & statements have as much effect as accurate information. Every thing which fosters and strengthens their natural suspicion and jealousy is well received by them. Whatever is done with them must be quick done by a commanding influence. I trust what I have here said needs no apology as my attention has been turned to this subject by duties which have been assigned to me from a branch of your Department.
I have allready forwarded my report in the case of Baley and shall send that in the case of Brodnax by tomorrows mail. The decisions I have made in these cases have been founded upon evidence which would have satisfied my mind as a juror in making up my opinion for a verdict in concurrence with the others. If I have been deceived, all the persons to whom I have had access, and who were in the way to be informed at the time have been deceived allso. Assertions made by the disappointed, springing from jealousy of the success of others, have been duly considered by me, notwithstanding their want of weight from want of character.
I am authorized to say in regard to the question with Georgia about the head of Sº Marys that if General Bernard now in that quarter were required to examine and report, it would be speedily decided, without additional expence, in great probability, by the next Georgia Legislature & Congress.”

<place-time>CAMP KING (Florida) May 16** 1827–</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, In answer to a communication received from Majº T. Cross, Act” for the Quarter Master Genl., authorising “the improvement of the navigation of the Oklawaha” &c," I have the honor to tender the following report.—
One of the principle tributaries of the Oklawaha, has its origin three miles from Camp King, in what is called the “Big-Spring”,”
which is from 6 to 7 fathoms in depth, and from 30 to 40 yards in width;-it forms a convenient place, for landing the supplies intended for this post.—A road is already opened to the spot intended for a landing, and the opening of this branch to its confluence with the Oklawaha, and the latter stream, from thence to its union with the St. Johns; will be commenced by the 24” of the present month, and compleeted, probably, by the middle of June; so as to be navigable for large boats & barges.—Three boats have been built, or are now finishing, suitable for the work which with one of a smaller class, that I shall hire, and the Tools I have provided, will comprise every facility for succesful operation.—
<pb#871/>
<pb#872/>
<pb#873/>
The articles which will be most wanted at this post, and which will be absolutely necessary, to render the Quarters comfortable in Winter, will be window-glass. Bricks & Lime:-We will want also, plank for flooring &c, as we cannot saw by hand, all that will be required;—together with nails, Iron and Steel.—Maj. Glassell requested me to mention the above named articles, as those that would be indispensably necessary—
The Character of the “Big Spring” branch or river, being somewhat singular, I hope the General will excuse me, for giving a slight sketch of it;-It seems a river issuing from the bowels of the Earth, and with the exception of the part I have before mentioned, it is subterraneous altogether.—The principle characteristics, of the small streams in this country, are, that they sink into the earth and appear again at intervals, that do not exceed two miles, and that their courses can be traced by the growth above them; but of this, no part is known save this branch, which appears to be the trunk of a large river, and its course cannot be determined, by any variation in the growth of timber.—The water is so pure & clean, that when the surface is unruffled, at the depth of 37 feet the most minute object may be discovered, even to the smallness of a pin, with as much ease, as through a glass medium of ordinary thickness.-
The current of this Stream, from its head 'till it joins the Oklawaha is from 1 to 2 miles an hour—the distance 15 miles *—

COL: R. BUTLER Tallahassee Florida SIR, Your favor of the 15” of May 11 has been rec" Charles Downing Esq. is the Register of the Land Office at St. Augustine. I am pleased to hear that you will be enabled immediately to commence the surveying of the Private Claims in West Florida, & hope that you will be enabled to make complete returns of all of them in the course of this winter. So soon as you can make out a plat of a Township containing private claims you will forward it to this Office, to enable us to give such additional instructions as may be necessary.
<pb#881/>
The tables of contents will exhibit the private claims and the Public Lands separately—that for the public lands will in all cases be added up and exhibit the total quantity. As the private Claims will sometimes cross the Township lines, the totals in that table cannot be always accurately stated. The subdivisions of the sections made fractional by the private claims should be exhibited on the Township plats in the same manner as those made fractional by other causes.—
It is altogether at the request of the War Department that the Indian claims are reserved from sale.
I will thank you to state as nearly as practicable what amount of money will be required by you to pay for surveying to be executed in
1827. I should think that you have Township lines enough already run out. It must necessarily be late in the Spring of 1828, before you can commence the surveys of the private Claims in East Florida, but when you do commence you should be prepared to proceed rapidly with them, in the mean time such Townships in West Florida as contain private Claims and those not heretofore sectioned, so far as they embrace lands of good quality and desirable to be brought into market ought to be progressing.”—

<docbody>SIR, I have received your letter of the 7” Ulto” accompanied with a plan of the Navy Yard near Pensacola.
I am about to dispatch one Deputy Surveyor to Pensacola, with a view to Commence work, and shall have two more in the early part of August.” The Season will be a dangerous one, and my Deputies act with much reluctance beleiving their lives jeopardized by the attempt.
Co” Exum who will Survey immediately in the vicinity of Pensacola & Barrancas will do ample justice to the Service.
<pb#882/>
S' Rosa Island will have to be Surveyed and I will thank you to advise me whether the Township lines must be actually extended over it, being so extremely narrow it will be very difficult to effect it, and by giving a location with the Township line on the west and meandering it, the general Connection Could then be formed by ideal lines.
Accompanied you have the Survey of the fractions around Neamathla's reserve, of which I communicated the intention to have run out from Gen' Call's having received instructions to reserve it from Sale.
I have the honor to be very respectfully. Yr. M' O St ROBERT BUTLER

<docbody>MAJ GEN" ALEX MACOMB Chief Engineer SIR My last communication (dated Tampa Bay Brook's Cantonement May 23°)” informed you that Capt" Poussin and myself were about to embark on the Revenue Cutter, Alabama, Cap" W Foster, to proceed to the examination of the coast extending from Tampa Bay to Pensacola. We left the former place on the 24” of May &
reached the latter this day.
Among the objects examined, Sº Joseph's Bay has received the attention to which it is entitled. The channel into this Bay lies and runs round the northern end of the Peninsula forming the Bay. Its width, on the bar, varies from 150 to 200 yards. The bar is from
500 to 600 yards in width measured in the direction of the channel and lies about 9% a mile from the inner point of the Peninsula: the depth of water over it was at full tide, 19% feet; at low tide may be reckoned at 17 feet. During the examination of this coast, we have derived from Capt."
W. Foster, not only the most effectual cooperation but also the most valuable information. And, in order to ensure more fully the accomplishment of this examination, Capt Foster, before leaving Pensacola, had procured the most experienced pilot on this coast.
<pb#883/>
<pb#884/>
<pb#885/>
We intend to leave this place for New Orleans, via Mobile-Bay, as soon as we have completed the examination of this Harbour, in relation to both defence and inland navigation.”

Apprehending that there might be some difficulty arising under the decision of Judge Woodward,” I declined authorizing the Sale in Lots of the 4 Sect. adjoining Tallahassee, and advised the Gen' of the fact, but if he desired it, the sale might take place in December next, when you will perceive there will be a public sale at Tallahassee. Will you be so good, as to give me your opinion, how far such a sale under all the circumstances will be advisable, as I presume the Gen' will leave it for us to decide.
Col” Butler & Gen' Call ask, each, I think, 5 pret. on the proceeds of the Sale for their trouble—this is too much. What would be a reasonable preentage? The papers afford all the news we have here.”

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a Copy of a letter addressed by you to Major Gen' Gaines, dated on the 15*
Ulto:” and in reply thereto, have to State that having been charged by the General in Chief, with the defence of the frontiers of Georgia and Florida, and having been vested by the same authority with full powers to dispose of the Troops Stationed in Florida, in any way that I should think best Calculated to effect this object—I did so, and reported to him, through your Office, as will appear from my letter dated on the 13* February, 1827,” a Copy of which is herewith enclosed—From this letter you will also learn that the Company Commanded by Captain Dade, and Originally Stationed on the Suwannee River was drawn back and established on the Oscilla River and much Credit is due to Cap' Dade and his Command, in Conjunction, with a party of Indians, sent to his aid by Cap" Glassell, for their zeal and Activity in Scouring the Country, lying between the Suwannee and Oscilla Rivers, and taking from their lurking places, fifteen or twenty Indians, supposed to have been Connected with the murderers of Carrs family—which prompt and energetic measures, have in a great measure, quieted the fears & apprehensions
<pb#887/>
of most of the inhabitants in that Section of Country—Cap' Dade was instructed to take a healthy position near the Oscilla River, and to make his Command Comfortable by erecting temporary Huts—
and it was not my intention that the Company should have Occupied that position for a longer period of time, than the fall—by which time, I believed that, that Section of Country, would have gained sufficient Strength, from the great number of families removing to it, to take Care of itself—It appears however from your letter to Major General Gaines, that the Hono: Secretary of War, has on information no doubt much more Correct than any I have been able to obtain, formed an Opinion on this Subject, different from the one entertained by the Officer who has the immediate Command in this Section of Country—
and in Carrying the Order for the removal of the Company from the Oscilla into effect, the responsibility is of Course removed from that Officer to the Authority from whence it eminated—I was under the impression that my letter to the General in Chief, as before alluded to, Contained Sufficient information as to the distribution and location of the Troops in Florida—but on referring to that letter, I find that I should have been more explicit as to the location of the new temporary Military post, directed to be established pursuant to Order 79, of 1826*—and I now have the honor to report that in Conformity to that Order, I Caused the post on the Suwannee river, to be abandoned, and a Site Selected near the Florida Agency for the new post, which post is now Garrisoned by two Companies of the 4* Infantry Commanded by Captain Glassell and to which he has given the name of Cant. King—From my knowledge of the Indian Character, I
Consider this post of more importance, in Controuling the Indians, and in giving protection and Security to the inhabitants of Florida, than any other post in the Territory, as it is in the immediate vicinity of the largest number of the Florida Indians, and between them and the white inhabitants—& I am also of the Opinion, that it is of the first importance that it Should be garrisoned by two Companies for altho' much Credit is due to Major Pierce and Cap" Glassell and their Commands, for their zeal and Activity in Carrying into Effect the instruction given them, relative to the Indians, Still in a Country like the One assigned to their protection, but little can be effected with one Company—with a knowledge of these facts, & a full view of all the Circumstances Connected with this Subject—I have Considered it my duty to Suspend the removal of One of the Companies, from the post near the Florida Agency until I receive further Orders on that Subject—and at the same time, beg leave to recommend in the Strongest terms, that the two Companies be continued at that post, * See ante, p. 652, n.
37.8835–58—55
<pb#888/>
until the Indians are quietly Settled within their limits or some other disposition made of them—Cap" Glassell has been instructed to open the Ocklawaha River, which Communicates with the Sº Johns, through which Channel, he will be able to receive all of his Supplies—
& he reports to me, that part of his Command are now employed on that Service”—

<place-time>S* AUGUSTINE June 13th 1827.-</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I now forward you my Report as promised in my letter of the
14* ultimo,” as full & explanatory as I can possibly make it—No private claims, or white settlements have been interfered with, except Big Swamp:-it was necessary to embrace all that tract to give the indians a sufficient quantity of good land to cultivate, and their attachment for that Swamp is inconceivable. Big Swamp contains, about Eight thousand acres of the first quality hammock lands, Five thousand of second quality hammock lands, & three thousand of Oak & Hickory lands of the second quality.—You will perceive by my Report that I have described the country on the East of the Ockelewaha River:-no white person would think of residing on that River with but One or two exceptions, even in the event of a removal of the Indians, and those exceptions would only be suitable situations for stock or cattle owners as there is but little good hammock land attached to any of those situations, say from fifty to One hundred aCreS.
The amount due me by the Government I hope you will transmit to me as early as possible—Lieu' D'espenville will forward his accº
from Savannah or Charleston; the amount due him will be deducted from the Accº curr" forwarded to you on the 15* May last.*
One hundred Dollars was paid to two Indians for finding Lieu"
D'espenville whilst lost, when on that duty. He was lost four days;
the fifth day at about 2 o’Clock P. M. he was found by two indians—
Every exertion by myself and party had been used without success until I employed indians, and no reward less than the amount above stated would induce them to assist me in the search; I commenced at Ten Dollars and continued to increase as the case became more desperate until One hundred dollars were offered, when about ninety of the Warriors turned out, & the second day two of them came up with him, consequently they were entitled to the reward. I have given Lieu' D'espenville my Certificate of the payment of that am", but have not charged it in my accº with the United States. I confidently rely on this am" being paid when said certificate is forwarded to your Department.”

[Enclosure:LS)
Joshua A. Coffee to Thomas L. McKenney S* AUGUSTINE June 1* 1827.
SIR, I herewith transmit to you a plat of the Indian Boundary as extended, together with field notes of the same, * agreeably to your instructions, and a copy of my instructions from His Excellency Governor Duval.”
In running the line I have not interfered either with white Settlements, or individual Claims, except in Big Swamp;-it was necessary to embrace the whole of it, to give the indians a sufficiency of good land for their support.—There is no good land embraced in the line north of Big Swamp, except small detached hammocks.-Wetuxy, about eight miles north of the Agency, contains only, about one thousand acres of good land:—The Cowpen Swamp has also some small hammocks of from fifty to one hundred acres.—You will perceive by the plat that the line was continued across the Ocklewaha River, and passes a little south of the middle grounds, between the Rivers Sº
Johns & Ockelewaha:—this line I think was all important to exclude them from the River Sº Johns & the white settlements on the Tomoca.
and Mosquittoe Rivers, and to remove those indian settlements on the west banks of Sº Johns River, they not having recognized the Ockelewaha their boundary as specified by the treaty. The Country embraced by that line is only adapted for them:-there is no good land, except very small detached hammocks on the margins of the Swamp of the Ockelewaha River, and a small portion of pine land, that many of them cultivate, with but little success; the remainder consists in ponds and scrub of the most inferior quality. By the plat you will observe many indian settlements, some of which are from twenty five to thirty years standing, the breaking up of which, would have created much confusion & distress among those unfortunate people, whilst the Country they occupy is not worth any thing to the Government, at the Same time they appear perfectly Satisfied with their Situation—
<pb#892/>
Big Hammock runs nearly parallel with the Gulf of Mexico for many miles, which you will observe by the plat, but contains but little good land, & that, at the north west end:—This Hammock is principally occupied by the indians formerly called the Red Sticks;
they removed from the State of Alabama during the late war and are an industrious friendly people—
The north line is about three miles south of Wetomkee:—the indians are generally satisfied with their new limits, and have a sufficiency of good land.—Line N° 1. running West passes through low flat pine land, and numerous cypress swamps & ponds:–the land is extremely poor.—Line N° 2, running North passes through the same description of Country. Line N° 3 running North 22° West passes thro’ cypress swamps & ponds for some miles in extent, after which the Sand hills commence & continue the balance of the line. —Line N° 4. running North 15° East, passes thro' high sand hills the whole distance, the growth of which is dwarf pine, black jack, & saw palmetto, and the country very poor. Line N° 5. running North, passes over the same description of sand hills for some miles & then crosses the Amaxura River, after which the country becomes low & swampy, for some miles, and then the Sand hills commence & continue to the North west corner, with the exception of one pond called Stony Pond, one mile across—The north line running North 80° East passes thro' high lands for the first Sixteen miles:–a small part of this distance you will observe that the line runs thro’small skirts of hammock, & a portion of mixed land of no value:—the balance of this line runs thro' low pine land, interspersed with cypress swamps ponds, branches
&*—The Ockelewaha River has on both margins, with but few exceptions, extensive Cypress swamps, from a half to two miles wide;—
the parts of the river where those swamps do not exist, runs thro'
extensive saw grass marshes, from one to three miles wide, which makes it impossible to approach this River, except at places where the indian trails cross it. After crossing the river & its swamps, a bay gall occurs, which is one mile thro’; then commences the Scrub of the most steril kind and continues the balance of lines N* 1, 2, 3, & a part of Nº 4 which the plat will show. From this point the country commences with undulating pine land, free from all Small growth, except saw palmetto, interspersed with clear water ponds, and the land unfit for cultivation. The balance of line N° 4 passes thro’ Creeks, swamps, and low flat saw palmetto land of no value.
Line N° 5 runs thro' Cabbage palmetto swamps & Creeks, also low flat pine land with saw palmetto, until it unites with the Cypress swamp South of the head of Sº Johns River.

The party was then compelled to retrace the line to the trail, which conveyed us to Tampa Bay, crossing the heads of the Amaxura &
Hillsboro' Rivers. Those rivers where crossed by the party, are nothing more than flat cypress ponds with small running streams:–
You will also observe by the plat, that between the heads of those rivers & lake Ahapopka, that there is a chain of sand hills for some miles of considerable heighth, say from forty to Sixty feet above the ordinary level of the Country. I was informed by the indians that those sand hills continued South some miles—I have to report the unavoidable loss of two horses, one of which I was compelled to replace by the purchase of another, but some hopes yet remain that one of them will be recovered; if so, it shall be immediately reported to your department. My principal guide was all important; without him the party would have been compelled to have reconoitered in many places for days & in some for weeks for the purpose of crossing the pack horses: Many of the Swamps are very extensive, & impassable except at certain places. You will observe by a copy of a letter dated September 1* 1826 * from the Q Master General; &
received by me the 19* of the same month instructing Lieut. Harvey Brown, the assistant Q Master at this post, to furnish me with the necessary outfits &", from which date I commenced my preparations.
I also forward a copy of a letter from Gov. Duval dated at Talahassee Oct. 14* 1826 * requiring my services. I have dated my accounts from the 17* of October, but I was engaged in preparing immediately after receiving Gen' Jessups order to Lieut. Brown for the necessary outfits—If you think I am entitled to my pay from the 19* of Sept at which time I commenced my outfits, you will confer a great favor by allowing the same, which will give me Twenty seven days additional pay—You will also observe by an order from the Adj" Gen.'
dated August 4** that Lieut D'espenville was instructed to join me at S*Augustine by the 25” of September if his military & appropriate duties could be dispensed with; he did not join me until the 15” of October—All the articles except those receipted for by the Assistant Q Master at this post, & Camp King were worn out in the Service—
You will perceive by my vouchers that I had with me Indian guides at the request of the Chiefs, which right they claimed under an article of the Treaty. I was also advised by Col. George M. Brook to receive them that they might see, that the line was run agreeably to the talk
<pb#896/>
at Washington, and that no further difficulties should arise respecting the boundary—

<docbody>HON. JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War SIR In pursuance of the instruction and authority, contained in your official letter, of the 26* of February last, * I entered upon the duties with which I was charged by that commission, immediately after my arrival in this Territory, and the enclosed correspondence and negotiation will inform you of the result of my exertions to accomplish the wishes of the Government and to releive the People
<pb#897/>
of this Territory from the evils of an Indian population immediately on their borders.”
From the complaints which have been so repeatedly made, of the influence of the agents of the Government, and of traders, who reside contiguous to, and in, the Nation, in creating prejudices against contemplated negotiations, and by improper interference, and advice, obstructing the natural currant of the wishes of the Indians, I deemed it proper to employ Special Agents to go into the Nation and ascertain thoroughly their views, on the subject of removal, to the West of the Mississippi before it was known that I had any authority on the subject.”
They were instructed to ascertain as far as practicable, whether the body of the Nation itself, uncontrouled by the influence to which I have alluded, or the authority of their own chiefs, would be disposed to emigrate, and, I regret to say, there is a decided repugnance to it, among all classes of the tribe, and I am satisfied that those who have written to the Department of War, suggesting their willingness to go, have consulted more their own wishes, than any correct knowledge, or information of the disposition of the Indians.
The causes which have produced this decided repugnance are
1*—Their entire ignorance of the Country, to which it is proposed to remove them.
2”—Their attachment to the land of their nativity, which operates more strongly on Savage than Civilized Communities.
3”—Their fear of the Indian tribes in that quarter, and an apprehension that they would all be exterminated.
The extension of their Northen boundary line, and the payment of the sum appropriated at the first session of the late Congress in provisions, have operated as auxiliary causes, to make them better satisfied with their location, than they otherwise would have been.
These are obstacles in the way of any negotiation with them, that can only be removed by an actual examination of the Country itself, and a positive stipulation, on the part of the Government of the United States, to protect them against the intrusions, or agressions
<pb#898/>
of those who inhabit that Country. That they must eventually be removed, or perish, I think there can be no question. The Territory which has been given to them in the Treaty of Camp Moultrie and the removal of the Northern boundary, in conformity with one of its provisions, contain land enough, capable of Cultivation, to support a population of the number composing the Seminole tribe, if it were cultivated with the care and economy, usually employed by our industrious white population. But with their habits of life, and ignorance of the arts of husbandry and agriculture, it is imposible that they can live within the present assigned limits—I understand that General Gaines has made a report on this subject, * from a more minute examination of the Country than I was able to give it;
I shall therefore, only refer to his report for an accurate detail of facts.
It is exceedingly difficult to make them believe, that any plan, proposed by the Government is for their benifit. The traditions of their fathers, and the history of the past, has impressed them with melancholy forbodings of their future destiny. They receive with great distrust any proposition, for the amelioration of their condition, proceeding from our Government, and it will require something more than promises to convince them that the humane plan of colonization recommended by the late administration, and improved and digested under the present, will be condusive to their improvement, and happiness. As the Government, however, has discharged its obligation to humanity, by offering them an exchange highly beneficial to themselves; it now remains for it to discharge a duty equally imperious to the people of this Territory, by confining the Indians to their boundaries, and thus secure the inviolability of the persons, and protect the property, of the inhabitants of this Territory, until the Indians shall discover that they cannot live there, and petition for the exchange; or until Congress shall change the present policy by which they are governed, of treating with them as independent nations, and take them under their absolute controul, and Legislate for them, as Minors', incompetent to take care of their own affairs.
I take great pleasure in saying that every facility and assistance in his power, was afforded me by the Agent during my visit to the nation, and I had every reason to beleive that he gave his hearty co-operation to assist me in executing the wishes of the Government.
I consider it highly important, to continue two military Cantonements in the interior of the Country to confine the Indians within their limits until they have become permanently located.
I would also, most respectfully recommend that a deputation of the Chiefs be sent over the Mississippi, to examine the Country, * NA (WD, West. Dept., Lets. Sent, Bk. 4). Cf. ante, p. 757.
<pb#899/>
under the direction of some discreet person, who is friendly to their Colonization there. The names which I enclose will perhaps be better qualified than any other of the Tribe, being the most intelligent, and trust worthy—
Although I have not succeeded in carrying into effect the humane intension of the Government my visit there, will not be without its benefits. The Indians were assured in positive terms, that for any injury in future to the persons, or property of our Citizens the aggressors only would not be holden responsible, but the Nation itself, whose duty it was to controul their people and to prevent such outrages. They appear entirely friendly and I do not think will be disposed again to commit any improprieties The presence of a Military force, however, is a salutary check upon them.”

<docbody>HON RICH* RUSH, S. of the Treasury.
SIR, In relation to the claim of Geo W. Ward Esq,” Reg of the L. O at Tallahassee for compensation for extra services rendered in
<pb#901/>
executing the Act of 22% of April 1826, granting preemptions to settlers in Florida,” I have the honor to report, that compensation has in no instance been allowed to the Register and Receivers for extra services in executing the several Acts granting preemption rights.
A number of the Officers have presented claims for such services
& are under an impression that an allowance will be made by the Executive Gov" but no final decision has yet been had.
On reference to the Laws of the US, it appears that the first Act in relation to preemption claims passed on the 10th of May 1800,” See Laws U States Vol 3. page 391. 16 Sect. Under this Act no additional compensation was allowed the Officers, it was however very limited as to its object.—The next act on the subject passed on the 3" March
1801." See Laws of U. S. Wol 3 page 429—the 3° 5” & 6th Sections of this Act, direct the mode in which the right of such claims Should be decided, and specifies the fees that are to be paid, all of which were payable by the party claiming the preemption. It is proper to observe that at this period, the Surveying fees, and fees to the Land Officers were paid by the purchasers of the public Lands.
The principles of the Act of 1801 were not extended to any other cases except those of Ohio.
In Mississippi, the Commissioners who were authorized to adjust private claims, and who received a fixed compensation were also empowered to grant preemptions to certain Settlers.”
The next Act which passed on this subject, was the Act of the
5th of Feb. 1813.” See L U. S. Vol 4 p 496. This Act invests the Register and Receiver with judicial powers and authorizes them to grant the preemption when they are satisfied that the party claiming has the right—and it grants no compensation except a fee of 25 cts, to the Register for receiving and filing each claim.
All the subsequent Acts granting preemptions in Missouri,” Arkansas,” Lousiana" and Florida,” have been based upon the provisions
<pb#902/>
of that of the 5* of Feb. 1813, And the Claims, therefore, of all the Officers who have acted under those several Acts, including that of Feb
1813 must abide the decision now to be made.
It may here be proper to observe that at the passage of the Act of the 3" March 1801, the Compensation of the Register was, a half per cent on the amount of money entered with them, & certain fees of Office, that of the Receiver was one per ct on the Am" of monies received. An Act of the 26* of March 1804,” abolished the fees paid by the purchasers of Public Lands, and gave to the Register &
Rec' a Salary of $500 pryear, and one half prºcent in addition to the percentage previously granted to those Officers.
The Act of 1813. and the subsequent Acts relative to the preemptions certainly impose extra duties on particular Land Officers for which there has been an omission, at least, apparently, on the part of the Legislature, to provide a special Compensation, except that of
25 cts, to the Register for receiving & filing each claim. Under these several Acts, and the Claim now presented, two questions arise First. Can the Executive supply the omission of the Legislature & grant a fair remuneration to the different Officers who have Acted under the Several Acts that have been passed?, and Second If the Executive deem it expedient to grant such remuneration in what manner shall it be made so as to give to each Officer a reasonable Compensation and in due proportion to the services rendered?
As to the general principle involved in the 1st Question, I beleive there has been several instances where the Executive under the general powers with which it is vested, of causing the Laws to be executed has supplied the evident omissions of the Legislature, by remunerating services required by law, but for which the Law had omitted to provide compensation If it be decided to grant a compensation in these cases, then a reference to Legislative provisions in analogous cases would necessarily be resorted to for establishing a rule for fixing the rate of compensation. A reference to the Land Laws will shew that where the law has granted compensation for extra services, it has given to the Officer
$5: a day when a full days work was expected to be performed—as in the case of Superintendants of public Sales &c.—but in those cases where the services required of the public Officers did not depend upon themselves, but upon the convenience or whim of other persons, and where the performance of the duty might occupy them only a few minutes in the day or perhaps a whole day, the law has granted a
<pb#903/>
compensation in proportion to the services actually rendered. As in the Case of the Act of the 3'd of March 1803 above referred to, and in the instances of the several Acts granting relief to the purchasers of public Lands, which grant fees to the Officers for each case in which they may Act—the allowance in the latter case is a dollar to each officer for each case of relinq* of a tract of Land, and in the former, it was something more than a dollar to each Officer, in every case of a preemption for one quarter Section.
On a reference to the returns of M* Ward, the present claimant, it appears that the number of claims acted upon and admitted by him vary from one to fifty eight on those days on which he was employed on this business, it would therefore appear that a per diem allowance would not give a compensation bearing any just proportion to the services rendered.
I should therefore recommend that the allowance be a specific one to each Officer for each preemption granted or acted upon—And having reference to the provisions of the Laws, and the facts, above stated, that compensation should not be less than $1. and a quarter for each case, to each officer, nor more than $1.50 exclusive of the
25 ct" allowed by Law to the Register. It appears from the returns of the Officers at Tallahassee that from the 1 of Aug" 1826 to 31 March 1827, they admitted 325 Claims.”

SIR, Your letter of the 30” ulto, has been received.” Since my letter of the 25" ulto to Major Glassell,” and that to you of the 7th instant,” it has been suggested that Col Clinch has given, or will give, a preference to the Alachua settlement over that on the Ausilla, in the selection of the “temporary position,” which he was authorized to establish last fall.—In that event, accommodations for the single company intended to occupy it will be necessary; and the labor which has already been bestowed upon that object, by your preparations, may not be lost. Should things take this course, the mechanic about to be discharged from the command; and whose services are represented as necessary, may be employed at the rate mentioned—He will not be retained however, a day longer than necessity requires.
With the reduced garrison designed for this position, it is believed, the necessity will not occur, for sending materials from Charleston or elsewhere, as requested in one of Maj Glassel's former letters—As the post is altogether “temporary,” any thing more than comfortable huts, for the company, would be improper. The transportation of brick, such a distance, could not be justified by the circumstances of the case. Suitable chimneys, can be readily constructed with logs and clay.”

Presuming that you will have obtained from Mº Butler before this reaches you, the information received at his office, by which you will find that the position Selected is near the Florida Agency, and that it is occupied by Major Glassells company of the 4* Regiment Infantry; I have to remark, that in accordance with the Instructions of the General in chief to Colonel Clinch of the 4” of January last,”
investing him with authority to Settle the differences and preserve peace between the Florida Indians and our frontier Settlers; I felt assured that the measures of Colonel Clinch were regularly reported direct to your office.

<docbody>SIR Your letter of the 14* April addressed to the Register and Receiver on the subject of Preemption claims granted under a mandamus from the Judge of this District was duly received,” and should have been sooner answered but we have delayed doing so until the Preemption Claims should be settled within the district of Lands proclaimed for sale in May last.”
We have now to inform you that no case of mandamus under the preemption Law has occured at this office subsequent to those heretofore reported and since the death of Judge Woodward we feel well assured that no others will occur. Agreeable to your suggestion we have reseved from sale the half quarter Sections of Land to which the Claimants would have been entitled had we been permitted to administer the Law without the interfereance of the Courts and we have again to renew our objections to the issuing of Patents in those Cases where entries have been made under Writs of Mandamus—It is proper that the department should be informed that in those the whole responsibility was assumed by the Judge, and that the Register and Receiver did in most of those Cases even examine the testimony on which the Writs were issued—As an evidence of the inattention and incapability of Judge Woodward at that period to discharge his official duties we inclose a Copy of the evidence on which a Mandamus was granted in the Case of Peter W. Gotier assignee of A W Sauls from which it will appear very satisfactorily that the claimant was not entitled under the Law—We believe that errors not less fatal have occured in many other instances and that the only means by which fraud and imposition on the Government can be prevented will be to remand these cases to us for Correction—It is a fact well known that Judge Woodward never examined the evidence in any of these
<pb#908/>
Cases, and that his Clerk was directed to issue his Writs to the applicants on abstract questions.
From your remarks on the claim of Gotier Sº we have thought proper to enclose you the Testimony on which the entry was made.”
We are convinced that he had no permanent residence in Florida prior to 1826 according to the Strict letter of the Law he would not have been entitled to a preemption but as he was one of the earliest and most extensive planters of the Country, the Register & Receiver Consider the equity of his claim sufficient to warrant its Confirmation—Should the Department entertain a different opinion we have to request that the entry may be made void and that the Receiver be instructed to return the money paid by Mr Gotier Sen'

<docbody>MAJOR The corporation of this city have taken possession of the lines of the town, which run from Fort St. Marks to the St. Sebastian River. and are about filling up the ditch immediately contiguous to the fort;-Where the main gate of the town formerly was, there were two large pillars, one of these they have partly torn down, and were about tearing down the other, when I thought it my duty to interfere and prevent any further demolition of the public property, until I
should have reported the circumstance to you;-the stones, of the pillars & foundations, are said to be worth $500 and I cannot learn that the corporation have any right to appropriate them to their own use;—should the fort, be repaired, which I understand Gen.' Bernard has recommended they will be very necessary for this purpose.
I wrote a note to the Mayor of the city requesting him to suspend the removal of the stones until I should have heard from you;*—I
have not yet received his answer but have no doubt that he will comply with my request.
<pb#909/>
Whilst, on this subject, I would also mention, that the corporation, have likewise possessed themselves of two or three other lots of land which, I believe, has not been assigned to their use, by the Secretary of War;-these they have leased out for 4 or 5 years;–on one of them was a large, old, stone building, known as the dragoon barracks, which they rased to the ground & sold the stones.”
This city is very poor, and needs all the assistance which it can obtain, & I certainly would rather assist it, than deprive it of any of its income, but, believing, that this property is under the particular charge of the Quarter Master Department I think it my duty to inform you of the manner of its appropriation.

Settlements should be early formed there to prevent the hunting incursions of the Indians which leads to depredations on the Stock of individuals where they are thinly settled & important from the recent removal of the Troops from the Oscilla Country to Pensacola.
I would suggest for your consideration whether or not it is desireable to have Forbes Claim Townshipped entire, with a view to ascertain the quantity of land contained theiren. As I have strong grounds for beleif that there are 2:000:000 of acres in the survey and I believe their grant was for 1200:000 acres—Should you deem it important I
should like your authority for doing so that I might take advantage of dry seasons to accomplish it: as heretofore I was unable to effect it from high waters.
I have just received a letter from my deputy Col” J W Exum at Pensacola: the the following is extracted for your information—“On my arrival I made application to the Mayor, his Clerk, and several of the Aldermen of the city as also the Keeper of the Archives & City Surveyor for the plan of the City, I was unable to obtain one, therefore by the assistance of the City Surveyor, & Keeper of the Archives, I have been employed ever since I reached this place in measuring &
beleive I have or will have in a few days a correct plan
“I did at first find some difficulty in measuring after leaving the English plan—the measurement being in perches or Arpents of Paris measure—that difficulty is surmounted but that is not the worst.
I fear—I find some claims commence at a picket 9% 5. 10:15 & as far as 25 miles from a defined point. The word about appears to be a common Commencment & running about N. N. E. (or some other mariner point) to a piquit so many Parisian perches &" but never Closes”
The foregoing will give you some idea of the maner in which the surveys of private Claims have been executed and prepares my mind at once for a contined scene of vauge & clashing interests—The Surveyors however which have been selected for this important duty I have the most implicit Confidence will perform it in a masterly manner, and when the Surveys shall have passed the ordeal of this office, I trust will be found to meet with your entire approbation.
By next mail I shall forward my quarterly accounts for the quarter ending 30” ulto.

<docbody>SIR, I received your letter post dated Washington June 1* acknowledging the receipt of the papers forwarded by me *—I have enclosed to you a package by this days mail in which eleven cases are impeached which I hope you will also file as caveats in the claims set forth—
You say in your letter that you have filed them as caveats to await such legal decisions as may be had thereon–From that expression I would infer that the validity of those entries must be determined by the Judiciary—It has been the practice of the Register and Receiver after granting certificates to reinvestigate claims and set aside entries where in their judgement they had been obtained on incorrect testimony or by any other improper means—
From what I have understood from them, that an entry made under preemption claim might be made void either at their office or at yours any time previous to the issuing of the Patent, which opinion I
supposed they had obtained by a correspondence with you—
If the validity of these entries and justness of these claims are to be determined by legal decisions, I am at some loss to know in what way it is to be had—Some of the cases depend on testimony, others on questions of Law arising out of facts, which appear in the office of the Register and Receiver—
If the Institution” I represent had such evidence of title as could be read in a Court of justice, these questions could be tried by bringing actions against those who are in possession of the land—Will a decision be had here, or at Washington, and in what way will the question be brought up—
Will you do me the favour to give me some information on these Subjects—or your opinion—I expected you would have answered my letter which accompanied the papers you acknowledged the receipt of—Perhaps you considered it unnecessary or out of the line of your business”—

<docbody>SIR By the last mail I received a communication from Major Cross of the 25th May.”
I had previously received a Copy of the order from the Adjutant General to Gen' Gaines dated 15" May,” but as yet have received no orders for the removal of the other company now attached to my command.
Notwithstanding the term “temporary” used in referrence to the continuance of one Company in the interior of Florida, I am led to believe, from the strong desire therefor, & apprehensions of the renewal of Indian outrages manifested by many very respectable Citizens of the Territory, that the Secretary will be induced to continue, at least one company for a much longer period, than his order appears to Contemplate.
Should one company be continued even for the winter, it will be absolutely necessary to have brick, & lime as stone cannot be procured in this quarter that will answer to make a chimney: lumber will also be wanted, which may probably be procured on the Sº Johns at a much less cost than at Charleston.
On the subject of the Oklawaha, I have the honor to enclose you a copy of the report of Lt Searight, who returned on the 18” ult.
from clearing the River, which he did more superficially, than he was ordered, in consequence of the sickness of nearly one half of his command, & having been deserted by some negroes who were sent by the Agent to render assistance.”

[Enclosure]
Joseph D. Searight to James M. Glassell Camp King, FLORIDA, June 20th 1827.
SIR, The Ocklawaha River before its junction with the Spring Run is not more than ten yards in width; and contains about one third as much water as the latter, which is nearly of the same breadth. The
<pb#913/>
River seems not to be much enlarged by this accession of water: but receiving its character from the Spring Run, which is very deep and clear, is seldom less than eight feet, and frequently fifteen or twenty in depth:-this depth continuing for some miles as well as its transparency. The bottom is, however, very irregular.
The Guide twice directed to take what I conceived to be not the main channel—Upon inquiry he informed that the larger streams dissipated themselves in the Swamps. This I did not then credit:
however, I followed his direction whilst descending; resolving to ascend the largest stream. This I did: but was obliged, ultimately, to make use of two very narrow and shallow passes—and although I
carefully examined the shore, which was between me and the larger body of water, I could not discover any stream which I supposed was the one I was in search of.--Small streams are continually running into and out of the channel—so that within a few miles it may vary from ten to twenty or thirty yards in width, and from two feet to six or eight in depth—and conversely.
The water in the narrow passes was less than two feet: frequently the boats, which draw less than a foot, got fast in the mud, or sand, as it might happen. One of the places, through which I was compelled to pass, is not more than nine or ten feet wide and two deep—
'Tis a mere cut-off, perhaps twenty yards in length—a larger passage is close by this, but at present there are not more than five or six inches of water in it. For half a mile above, and some distance below, the stream is very narrow and quite shallow; and here and elsewhere the River is difficult to navigate, even with canoes, from the short and frequent bends, and the rapidity of its current; sometimes running directly (perpendicularly) upon the bank, and with such velocity that the boats, with no little difficulty, are kept off the shore, with poles; oars being here useless—Generally there is too great a depth of water, or of mud, to use setting poles.
The highest water-marks I saw, were a little more than three feet—
but the more distinct, and where the water appears to continue the longest time, are about two feet above the present level.”
I have the honor to be, Very Respfy Your's, (Signed) J. D. SEARIGHT Lt. 4* Inf’y.

GENT. Your comm” dated 16th of May * and postmarked—June in answer to my letter of the 13th of April," has been received. The diagram enclosed satisfactorily explains the position of the several reserved tracts near the Town of Tallahassee. It is however very much to be regretted that there has been an omission on the part of the Officers to enter on their Books at the time, the particular tract selected by the L* Govº under the Act of the 24th May, 1824,’ as however, of the five tracts reserved at that time the N E 94 of Sect.

R. 1 West. is the only one which corresponds with the terms of the Act of 24th May 1824, and an appropriation of part of which was made by the 14th Section of the Act of the 8th Feby 1827,” it must legally be considered as the particular tract reserved by the L* Gov" under the provisions of the Act of the 24th of May 1824.

<docbody>LT F D. NEWCOMB A. A. Q." Master Camp King.
SIR, Your letter of the 15" ulto,” enclosing a report from the Officer in command of the party employed in improving the navigation of the Ocklawaha, has been received.
<pb#917/>
I am informed by the Commissary General of subsistence, that you have been authorized to draw upon the depot at Charleston for the necessary supply of provisions—In doing so, you will, as agent of this Department, advise Lt Rigail," who is acting in its behalf at Charleston, minutely as to the course to be pursued in making the shipment and endeavor to meet the transport at the head of navigation, with boats to take out her cargo, or at the store house at Picolata, so that she may not be detained.
The suggestion to store the supplies in the first instance at that place, seems judicious, as it might happen, that your boats would not precisely meet the transport on her arrival, or might be insufficient to take the whole of the cargo: But, if that course be adopted, a guard should be kept there for the safety of the supplies until they can be carried up.
Perhaps, when the waters rise in the Ocklawaha a small coasting vessel, large enough to take the requisite supply of provisions from Charleston, could ascend to the mouth of the creek—If it should promise this, after your examination of it, Lt Rigail should be advised on the subject, and informed as to the draft of water, in order that he may make his contract conform to it.
It appears that Col Clinch has fixed upon your position, as intimated in a former letter and that both the companies now there, will remain for the present. The necessary accommodations must, therefore be prepared for them—but it must never be lost sight of, that the position is temporary, and that the accommodations should be of a corresponding character.
Not knowing, precisely, the kind of boat suited to the occasion, orders cannot be given, to forward the two, you say will be required, from Charleston. Can they not be built by the troops? Or by storing at Picolata, will not the three you have, be amply sufficient?”
I am, Sir &"

<docbody>MAJOR I have the honor, herewith enclosed to forward you, an Abstract of Proposals received, for erecting a bridge across the St.
<pb#918/>
Sebastians River, together with copies of the proposals and a copy of my advertisement; *—you will perceive, Sir, that the lowest of the bids, exceeds the appropriation;–I therefore have entered into no contract.
For the gratification of the citizens, I proposed for three separate places, though I was aware, at the time that at two of them, no bridge could be built for the sum;-at the third place, which is the most eligible, the owner of the land refuses to give a right of way;-North of this, about one eigth of a mile, the property on each side of the river belongs, I believe, to the U. States, and the situation is very good, though not quite so convenient as the others;–I invited proposals for this place also;-On each side of the river where the bridge must cross there is quite a wide marsh, over which, it will be necessary to make a substantial causeway;-I invited proposals for it, but received no answer bid;—I would suggest, whether this might not be done by the U.S. Troops;–if so, the materials extra pay &"
would amount, I think to about $150 or $200
As I have not accepted either of the proposals for the bridge, I
shall await your further orders, on the subject.—
I have yet heard nothing, about the Troops for the opening the road;—The season is now so far advanced, that I presume they will not be ordered here until fall;-I am anxious to know, that I may purchase the teams, tools &”;—I wrote to Tampa Bay enquiring what tools, &" I can obtain from thence, but have not yet received an answer;-I shall have to make my purchases at Charleston & do not want to go there for this purpose until I can learn what articles I can obtain from Tampa Bay, and when the Troops will probably be here, as I wish to avoid the expense of keeping the mules & oxen, theºpleyed for any space of time.”

14th of April 1* has been recº & submitted to the S. of the Treasury, who is of opinion that in those cases where there has been a judicial decision, & from which an appeal cannot now be taken, the patents ought not to be withheld, provided, you are of opinion that the party was originally intitled to a preemption, but if you are of the opinion that the party had no such original right, it will be proper for you to retain the papers in your Office—& advise this Office of your reasons for so doing.
The Law having made the Register & Rec' the judges of the evidence on which preemptions are granted, the Secretary does not feel disposed to interfere with their decisions. If however, on a revision of those decisions you are of opinion that you have improperly granted any preemption, the Rec" is hereby authorized to refund the amount paid on such preemption.
<pb#920/>
As in compliance with your request no patents have yet been issued on preemption Certif", I have now to request that you will with as little delay as practicable revise the preemption cases & furnish to this Office a particular list of those cases, in which you think it will be proper to withhold patents, stating the reason in each case.
Such a list will enable us to commence the issuing of patents in those cases not disputed.”

<docbody>DAVID THOMAS, Esq Tallahassee F
SIR, Your letter of the 3'd July inclosing descriptions of eleven cases of preemptions in which you request patents to be suspended,”
has been rec" & Caveats entered in those cases.
All the evidence of title which the Deaf & Dumb Asylum of Ky has at present, or can have in relation to the disputed cases which you have reported to this Office, is, the law granting the preemption, the authority to the Agent to locate and the approval of the same by the Secretary of the Treasury.
The manner in which they are to proceed under such title is a question on which the Trustees or Agent will take proper legal advice.
I presume, however, that the evidence of title is entirely sufficient to enable them to institute suits in Chancery against the parties holding preemption Certif" issued by the Reg. & Rec. for the purpose of trying the right of title.
The extent to which the Executive can act, in those cases where preemption Certif" have been issued, is to withhold patents, when the Cert" has been irregularly issued.
The Reg & Rec. have been requested to report all Cases, where on a revision of the testimony, they are of opinion that the Cert. has been irregularly granted,” and patents will be withheld in the Cases thus reported by them.

States made a distribution of it, between the civil & military authorities;–
I was accordingly ordered (I enclose a copy of the order) to execute the orders of the President, which was accordingly done, & the civil authorities were immediately put in possession of the lots & buildings appropriated to them by the President, & I took charge of the remainder, (including the lines of the town, & the two lots ef which the municipal authorities have rented out);-Since then, no other disposition has been made of the public property that I am aware of;-at the last Session of Congress the public square was given to the City & this is the only property which they legally possess.-I
made application to the Mayor for his authority for taking possession of this Property, & he says that he has none.—
I have the honor to enclose you a note which I addressed the Mayor;
notwithstanding which he persisted in pulling down the pillars, in consequence of which I applied to the U. S. Attorney, (a copy of my letter, I also enclose) who took legal measures to stop them.
<pb#926/>
I think the conduct of the Mayor very extraordinary, for certainly no injury could accrue, by the short delay which I requested, & I can account for it, in no other manner, but this, the stones are worth from
$500 to $800 and he, himself has purehased is to receive them, for filling a part of the ditch which will not cost more than $100 or $150.-
I think, Sir, that admitting the Sec. at War has permitted them to occupy this property, that the case is in no manner altered;—for then, they are only tenants & surely have no right to destroy the property, & appropriate the proceeds, to their own benefit.
I am the more anxious that my conduct respecting this property should meet your approbation, because the Commanding officer refused to interfere, & only a sense of duty, could have induced me, to the disagreeable office of interfering with the civil authorities of the town, but I am persuaded I am right, and thinking so, I never will be backward in performing my duty.

<source>[NA: OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.: AD]</source>
<place-time>[July, 1827]</place-time>
<docbody>To The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.
This memorial of the Legislative Council of Florida humbly represeneth, that under your patronage they have beheld our Territory prosperously Situated: increasing in population, and gradually developing those resources of wealth, with which She is by nature so lavishly endowed.
With due gratitude for past favours, your memorialists, from a belief, that the General Government will ever conceive the growth of Florida, intimately connected with the prosperity of our rising republic, have again presented themselves as petitioners before you, and ask that relief only, which Congress in its wisdom may deem expedient to grant.
Your memorialists represent as the most serious grievance, which afflicts our Territory, the present location of the indian tribes within our boundary. But above all that they have been permitted to roam through the country, plundering those whom their avarice might seize on, and murdering those whom their revenge might Select.
The tract of Country assigned them by the treaty of 1823 * has always been complained of by them, as incompetent to their Support;
and the additional grant Subsequently made them, has been the occasion of much dissatisfaction among many of our citizens; and probably not without cause. In addition to this, the present location is in the pathway of our Settlers, and has already seriously impeded the settlement of the fairest part of Florida, and will now cloud all its prospects. The land in this vicinity is excellent, and but for the obstruction of this unfortunate, though not less obnoxious tribe of beings, would before this, have borne on the current of the St Johns all the rich and luxuriant products of a tropical climate. Besides they have never gone within their boundary, but have scattered themselves in different parts of the Territory, and to the great annoyance of our citizens. They have stripped the corn from our fields before our eyes; they have burned our houses and murdered our citizens. All this they did, and have been doing for the last season within twenty miles of the walls of St Augustine and with impunity.
But more recent outrages have been committed which has thrown
<pb#929/>
a damper on the spirits of our agriculturists, and present our Country under a gloomy aspect. The most inhuman butcheries have been committed by them; a whole family has fallen a sacrifise to their vengeance, and individuals have been murdered while on the high way and engaged in that industry which constitutes the Soul, and energy of our country. Our corn houses have been broke and plundered; our cattle killed, and our citizens driven from their homes, and threatened with all the horrors of indian cruelty, within the space of the last two months, and within forty miles of our capitol.
The vigilance of our Governor and the promptness of our militia have for the present checked their outrages, and in some degree quieted the fears of our citizens, but at what time, and in what place, the bent bow will let slip its arrow, the blood of our citizens, will we fear, soon proclaim. In this gloomy situation of our Territory, your memorialists beg the speedy removal of these people out of the Territory. If they are dissatisfied with their present Situation as appears: if they have never complied with the stipulations of their treaty as is manifest; if they have been guilty of the most glaring and unprovoked outrages certainly they have forfeited their claim to humanity, and are the fit subjects of our policy. We most earnestly recommend that they be forthwith, called to their boundary: and commissioners appointed to hold a new treaty with them, stipulating their immediate removal from the Territory to the Indian country west of the Mississippi and that the commissioners be vested with full power to carry the Same into execution.
It is not to be forgotten that these indians have already cost the United States more than one hundred thousand dollars, and that their present condition requires another appropriation or esle they will be compelled to have resort to unlawful means for subsistence.
Your memorialists would further recommend, that a regiment be ordered to some point on the St Johns, at as early a period as possible for the protection of our frontier settlements, which are in that region entirely unprotected. Especially do your memorialists urge the adoption of this measure since it is by some confidently believed that the nation is bent on war; whether true, or not your memorialists cannot say.”

<place-time>[July, 1827]</place-time>
<docbody>HON JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War, -
Sir, I hope that I may not be deemed importunate, if I beg leave again to request your attention to the subject of the Indians in Florida, so vitally important to the people, whom I have the honor to represent. Were I not again and again to press on the attention of the department of War the necessity of removing them, I should virtually abandon the interests of my Constituents, and leave their persons a prey to the capricious mercy of the savage, and their property, subject to his precarious sense of moral honesty, and obligation to the laws—You have learned from the correspondence with your Department that a large family of women and children, since the meeting of the present Congress, have been butchered by these Indians, and their bodies consumed in the flames of their dwellings, within 20 miles of Tallahassee. If then Sir, I did not urge to this Government by every obligation, of justice and policy, by every Constitutional injunction, to secure to the Citizen of these U. States the inviolability of his person and property I should be unworthy to be trusted with the destines of a people, whose confidince it would be my pride to possess, and whose best wellfare will never cease to be the ruling principle of my conduct. With what confidence, could I meet them on my return if I had been silent here, when there they had not been safe, in their houses? If I remained unmoved, when helpless women and children had been butchered and burnt. No Sir, it must still be my pride, that I was importunate, if unsuccessfull, and that I
laboured assiduously if I laboured in vain.-
There are many considerations suggesting the necessity of the speedy removal of the Florida Indians—The early history of the States, is full of the danger, ever incidint to frontier settlements, with Savage borderers—I will not trouble you with examples—I mention the fact, barely to shew its universal application to the planters of that Territory. Every Settlement is on an Indian border—Every plantation in East Florida is necessarily a Frontier, in many instances, from 20 to 60 miles distant, from a Civilized neighbour. I will not waste your time, by pointing out the perils to which a planter so situated is subjected: The inability to procure relief, when he is threatened with the Tomahawk: the certainty of insult, when his wild Visitant, infuriated as he ever is by drunkenness, would sacrifice a family for the refusal of rum: when he dare not complain from the dread of vengeance, unrestrained by the apprehension of dedection—
In a word, when the constant sense of impending danger, damps his

exertions and embitters his life, is it wonderful in such a state of insecurity, that new settlers are detered from coming, and old ones driven away? It is a fact sir well known, that Major Woodruff late of the army, now one of the largest and most valuable planters on the East of the Suwanee, has long been on the point of returning to Georgia, and nothing has saved to us that judicious planter, but the immensity of his crops. He has already had one man murdered at his house, and after the recent melancholy fate of the Carrs, his sense of insecurity will be doubled. And this is the condition of East Florida. No planter would venture to leave his family at home in the country, during his own absense. In a thickly settled community the presence of these indiands would not be so dreadful an evil.
There one neighbour would be a safeguard to an other. There too, the weight of population, would give to the white man a consciousness of security, and to the Indian a corresponding dread of detection.
There punishment would follow on the heels of crime, and operate to prevent its repetition. There would be the moral influence of civilized example. Here Sir, it is awfully the reverse. The Indians are the prevailing population, and the whites are considered, as solitary and unprotected intruders: But I will not dwell on this picture. I
will shew you a happier prospect. I will refer you to the condition of Florida west of the Suwanee—filling with emigrants from every portion of the union—Forrests falling before the axe of Industry and fields of cotton blooming where they stood—I will shew you a city, in the place of a wigwam—and a press inculcating the mild principles of republicanism, where the war hoop was lately heard. And, Sirr why is this? The land claims have been adjusted, and the savages expelled—it needs no comment.
I might point out the impolicy, to the Gen' Government itself of the present location—That they have already paid near $200,000, in the few years since it was made—That they have given away
4,032.000 acres of land a portion of which is better fitted for sugar and cotton, than any in the Union. That the game was exhausted, and annual appropations must be made to keep them from starving.
That the want of game, would drive them to depredations on the cattle of the whites, who by retaliation would render bloodshed, if not war inevitable, and finally, their utter extermination. That the ground now covered by their location, embraced many private grants, which the U States must pay for. That their present position rendered military posts indispensible, which were more costly in an unsettled country, I might urge that it was impolitic if not dangerous in case of invasion, to leave an interlal foe, as numerous as the whites, in a frontier remote from the States, and inaccessible, in the moment of need, to be tampered with, by such enemies, as it has been our lot
<pb#932/>
to find. Sir, such men as Nicols, and Ambrister, and Arburthnot, aided by British arms and British gold operating on savage cupidity would revolutionise East Florida and massacre the whites, before the people of Georgia could hear of the danger.
There have been brought to my notice many case of individual damage, committed by Indians on individuals the property of respectable planters, particularly in the county of Alachua. This Siri is a growing County; with a large body of good lands, and many wealthy landholders. Such, and so great, I I am given to understand are the losses sustained by the inhabitants of this county, that it would be a bare actof justice, to direct, the Indian agent, in accordance with the act of
1802,” to remunerate the sufferers, out of the annuity allowed by congress to the tribe-Independent of the justice to the parties, in making the Indians pay for the stock they had stolen, it would have the double effect of preventing the repetition of such offences in future, and of curing all heartburnings arising from the necessary retaliation of the whites. It would compel the Indians to rely more on their own honest industry, and by preventing feuds and private quarrels spare to humanity the recurrence of such dreadful scenes as have just been presented by the tragedy of the Carrs. To this desirableresultnothing is necessary butto direct the Indian agent, out of the annuity granted them, to pay to the people of Alachua, whatever damage and loss, he may ascertain by proof to have been sustained—I submit this proposition to you, in full confidence that you will leave nothing undone, which humanity and justice require you to do.—
I will not here detain you Sir, with the importance of East Florida, it was fully appreciated by the Government before the purchase was made—That importance is in no danger of being diminished as the Country is known, and its resources developed—As long as sugar is a staple, and cotton a necessary, as long as the fruits of the tropics are prized—and as long as health is deemed a blessing, East Florida will be important to the planter and St Augustine necessary to the valetudinarian. And now Sir, it rests with the Government of the U States whether this shall be its most important acquisition, or remain a barren wild, safe, only to the savage tread, whether it shall teem with every fruit, and every luxury, springing from the arts of civilization, or whether the hut of the honest planter, shall prove his cemetery. I
have already addressed to the Department a letter on this subject. I
have appealed to the Government on the behalf of my suffering fellow citizens: by every claim of justice and humanity: by the lives and
3° 2 STAT. 143–144.
<pb#933/>
property of my constituents, by the horrors of the present, and the hopes of the future: I have appealed to the true policy of the Government; to its econemy in peace, to its safety in war: to the obligation upon it to protect its suffering Citizens—It is now ascertained beyond question that the bill for the concentration and civilization of Indian tribes west of the Mississippi cannot be acted on at this session of Congress—The remainder of the appropiation of twenty thousand dollars will soon be exhausted—Your Agents in Florida inform the Government that the game is destroyed, and the climate and country unpropitious to the cultivation of corn.—The Indians are now reduced to the necessity of subsistence by the plunder of the inhabitants of East Florida, or to the dreadful alternative of absolute starvation—
This is no picture of fancy, it is an awful reality—our only resource is the interposition of the Executive I have therefore most respectfully to ask, that a commission may be constituted to treat with them for a cession of their lands, (which are not adapted to any cultivation known to them,) for others west of the Mississippi, where there is game and land less valuable to the U States, and suited to their natural habits, and cultivation.
The most of these Indians are a part of the Creek Nation, and could be incorperated with the emigrant party—They avow their willingness I understand to go, and indeed when they perceive, as they must do, that they must emigrate, or perish, there is no question as to the selection they would make.”
I have the honor to be with high considerations of respect Yº Ob"

Sir Your favor of the 24 Ulto." covering a letter from y' Deputy, M* Exum, complaining of the difficulty of surveying private claims in consequence of the refusal of the claimants to shew, or aid in shewing their boundaries, has been rec". The act passed at the last Session of Congress * relative to the surveying of private claims varies materially from that originally drafted, & is defective in several respects, yet no provision was made in the Act as drafted against the particular difficulty your Deputy complains of, to wit, that the claimants will not shew their boundaries. It is difficult if not impracticable to make any legal provisions by which the owner of a claim confirmed on a survey or grant could be compelled to shew their boundaries. The advantages however of obtaining a resurvey
& procuring a title immediately from the U. S. are such as it was presumed would have made every claimant anxious to obtain such resurvey & title. The object of a resurvey on the part of the U
States is to ascertain the vacant & public Lands. The claimant has obtained, it is true, a legal right under the confirmation but in cases of controversy as to title, he must be able to shew in a Court of Justice that his survey was legally made under the Spanish Gov' &
must prove his boundaries. Whereas by a resurvey and title derived from the U. S. he is relieved from all difficulty. These advantages ought to induce all honest bone-fide claimants to give every possible facility & information by which their claims could be resurveyed and a different course can be accounted for only from ignorance or fraudulent intentions. When the refusal arises from the first cause every possible precaution should be taken to satisfy the party of its evil consequences and every exertion should be made to survey his claim correctly, but the attempts of the latter should not be permitted to arrest the progress of public surveying.
Under the provisions of the 7th Section of the Act of the last Session, your Surveyors should be furnished with as accurate a description of each claim confirmed as the records will afford, with this description, which is all important, and such documents and information as he can procure from the claimant he is to make the survey, but if he cannot ascertain the location from the description
<pb#939/>
thus obtained, and the claimant refuses or declines to furnish the necessary information then the Law cannot be carried into effect in relation to such claim and the Surveyor will proceed to survey the residuary Lands in the Township as public Lands, leaving the claimant to establish his claim in a Court of Justice, in case of controversy with other confirmed claims or with purchases under direct title from the U States.
Every precaution should be taken to give notice to claimants of the time when the District of Country in which their claims are situated will be surveyed and in the public notice which you were in my letter of the [blank]. last requested to give,” you should state distinctly the course that will be pursued, when the boundaries of a claim cannot be ascertained from the documents furnished by the Keeper of the Archives or those in the possession of the Claimant.
It is proper to observe that the law presumes that the information to be derived from the records will enable the Deputy to locate &
resurvey the claim, but if this information does not enable him to make the survey and he is obliged to depend upon the information of the claimant he should make to you a particular Statement of the facts, to enable you to exercise the power with which you are invested by the last clause of the 7th Sect: of the Act of Feb’ last.—If marked trees are shown by the claimant the Deputy will generally be able, with tolerable accuracy, to ascertain, whether the age of the marks corresponds with the date of the survey.
The Act of the last Session (8 Feb) is altogether silent as to the mode of surveying the few claims in West Florida which were confirmed on account of occupation or cultivation previous to 1819. If therefore the Commissioners Certif. of Confirmation does not designate the manner in which they are to be surveyed, these Lands must be surveyed as other public Lands designating the Section in which each claim respectively may lie, and particularly noting whether the improvements extend to more than one Section and whether there be two different improvements in the same Section. With this information the claims may be located in entire Sections or by eighths of Sections in as compact a form as possible so that the actual improvements do not interfere.
As the survey of the private claims will be attended with some difficulty your Deputies may be unwilling to enter to Contracts to survey them or may fail to execute those which they have undertaken.
You should therefore let them distinctly understand that no other surveying will be contracted for until the private claims are surveyed, and that such Deputies who contract & execute their contracts for
<pb#940/>
private claims, will have the preference in obtaining Contracts for other surveying—and in all cases where a Deputy fails to execute a contract for surveying private claims no other should be granted to him.—
Being thus possessed of the views of this Office & having before you the laws and Reports of the Commissioners, it is hoped & believed that you will be able by a careful investigation of the subject to give such particular instructions to your Deputies as will ensure the survey of the private claims in West Florida. The survey of them in East Florida will probably be attended with more difficulty & embarrassment. It is desireable therefore that you should suggest such amendments of the Act of the last Session as experience may point out as necessary, and I will submit them to the Land Comme” ”

<docbody>SIR. We have been requested by one of the parties concerned to State the following case for your decision; it being one in which the Register & Receiver believe they have no power to act.
Abraham Philips inhabited and cultivated a tract of Land Situated in Sections 20 and 29 prior to the 1* day of Jany 1825, Soon after this period he died without issue, leaving two Brother William P and
<pb#941/>
Ephraim Philips as his heirs. The latter resided in the State of Alabama and was supposed to be dead, the former conveyed his interest in the improvements to Nancy Philips the Widow of the dec" who on the 1* of Jan 1827 applied at this office and was permitted to enter the East half of the South East qr of Section 20
Township 7 Range 12 N & East. on which the principle improvements of the said Abraham Philips were situated. The other eigth of this quarter Section was entered by John Williams who inhabited and cultivated the same quarter Section. Some time afterwards the attorney of Ephraim Philips, the other heir of Abraham Philips applied at this office for an entry on an eigth of Land in a different Section which had been located by the Agent of the Kentucky Assylem.
The Register and Receiver refused to permit the entry, 1* Because the claim of Abraham Philips whether located by himself or his heirs must be confined to an entire legal quarter Section, and could not be located in two eights of different Sections. 2" because the land intended to be entered had been previously located by the Agent of the Kentucky Assylem.”

entertainting doubts as to my authority to grant the permissions Solicited, I thought it proper, to refer the Subject to the Superintendant, for decision.
I have no question, that in many cases, if not all it would be an essential advantage to the Indians, to Sell their Slaves at a reasonable and fair price—The capitol realized from the Sales, might be invested in much more useful & profitable property—The negroes of the Seminole Indians, are wholly independent, or at least regardless of the authority of their masters; and are Slaves but in name; they work only when it suits their inclination and are their own Judges, as to what portion, of the products of their labour, Shall go to their owners; their habits are, with few exceptions, indolent in the extreme, on which account, their example is calculated to have a baneful influence upon the Indians, whom it is desirable and necessary to withdraw as fast as practicable from their erratic and idle habits, to the pursuits and practice of industry, without which, they will not, as game is rapidly diminishing, be able much longer, to exist in Florida A more Substantial reason however, than the one above offered in favour of allowing the Indians to dispose of their Slaves exists in the fact, of the great influence the Slaves possess over their masters, which is uniformly exercised in exciting their jealously of the whites, whom they artfully represent, as being hostile to all who differ from them in complection, and the recollection of the many acts of injury and injustice, which the Indians have received from their white bretheren, it may be easily imagined, would make them give ready credence to these cunning Suggestions of their negroes; whom they look upon, rather as fellow Sufferers and companions in misery than as inferiors.
There are Several owners of slaves, who have resided Some years in the Territory, but who really belong to the creek nation, to which they are desirous to return; but cannot prevail upon their Slaves to accompany—for which reason, they have made repeated demands for liberty to sell them I have refused, because uninstructed relative

The Indians complain loudly of the restraints put upon their freedom of action in this particular, and claim the right to dispose of their property at pleasure, but cannot find persons willing to purchase, without the permission of the constituted authorities—I have no Scruple in Saying, that did I know myself authorized, I Should in most instances, grant without hesitation the permission—I shall be glad of your opinion and advice upon the Subject”

<docbody>SIR, I have duly received your letter of the 21* ultimo."
M" Hernandez having lately stated that a great sacrifice would result to him if his real property was sold under execution, and that by a delay of from six to twelve months he would be enabled to pay the bond on which he is surety at your Custom House, from the produce of his lands, I concluded to allow him a further indulgence of six months from the 1" of this month. At the expiration of this time, if the debt be not paid, it will be proper for you to cause execution to be issued and levied, not on real property, but on negroes, or such other personal property as he may possess; provided a levy has not already been made on real property. The Marshal should be directed in all cases of fieri facias * put into his hands, to levy upon personal
<pb#945/>
property, if the debtor has it, before he proceeds to sell the real property. The laws of most of the States have sanctioned this course, and in the case of defaulting Collectors of Internal Revenue, the acts of Congress expressly direct that the Treasury Warrants to be issued against them, shall be first levied upon their personal property.
You will let the Marshal understand therefore, that in all cases of execution put into his hands on account of the United States that he is first to proceed against the personal property of the debtor, and that any departure from this course, whereby a loss shall accrue to the United States, will subject him to the animadversions of the Treasury. The territorial law to which you allude as governing executions, can have no force, unless the Court of the United States issuing the execution, shall have expressly adopted it as a rule of its proceedings. In any other event the common law must govern.

<docbody>SIR, It is the opinion of M* Allen & myself that. a Sale of public lands in East Florida Should be advertised for the spring of 1728.”
There are many who wish to purchase, in this Territory, tho perhaps not those lands now surveyed—It would bring settlers to the country
& encourage an examination of the soil—It is probable that the most of the private land Claims will then be Settled, & we are of opinion that much good public land will remain to the government.

<docbody>SIR By the last mail I had the honor to receive your communication of the 16** August.”
Under a belief, when I first came here, that this post would be as permanent as the continuance of the Indians on these lands, I had laid off the officers quarters to have chimnies of brick in the centre of each block: I shall however now make them of logs, and at the ends.-I have also, ever since my arrival used every exertion to curtail, as much as possible, expence to the United States, by sawing lumber; in which I have so far succeeded, as to have a sufficiency for tollerable comfort, altho' more is wanted; to supply which I keep one saw in constant opperation, which is all my present diminished force will admit of.
I lately sent the Acting Ass. Q Master to examine the direct land route from this to Palatka on the S" Johns. to ascertain whether a waggon road could be easily made: and having, for many reasons, strong doubts that the channel of the Oklawaha, partially cleared out by Lieut Searight, in June last, was not the best or deepest, I
have again dispatched him with a boat and five men to endeaver to ascertain if there is not a better one; and was under a hope that his return would have enabled me to forward by this mail, both his and the Acting Ass. Quartermaster's report for your information on the question as to the most economical mode of supplying this post.*
They shall be forwarded as soon as practicable.
I have the honor to be very Respy yr. Mo. Ob. Sº

You will see by Lieut Searight's that he has found a much better channel than at first discovered; and, inasmuch as he thinks the river two feet lower than its usual height, there is every ground to believe that it may be rendered navigable for boats drawing three feet water.
Had I another company here, I think, with the addition of Negroes that would be furnished for their rations by the inhabitants of Alachua, to further an object so important to them, I could effect it, at least so far as to secure great advantages to both parties.

SIR, In obedience to your orders I have examined the Country between this Post and Palatka, on the St. John's, as carefully as the nature of the duty required, and have the honor of making the following REPORT:—
The nearest route for a road, would be in a direction from this, N.E. varying a few points to the N. & E. in order to obtain the highest land—the distance about 50 miles.—The first 7 or 8 on this route is generally a white sand ridge; from thence to the outlet of Orange Lake, a distance of about 20 miles, the Country is low and
<pb#959/>
interspersed with cypress, clear water ponds and swamps, which extend from Orange Lake to the Oklawaha, in a general direction from N. W. to S. E.;-during the wet season, this whole extent of Country is inundated;—the water on its surface being from 6 to 18
inches in depth.-There is but one place, where the Orange Lake Creek could be bridged, with any prospect of its remaining when the waters were high, or of its being useful when they were low—
this is, at the high banks between the upper & lower crossing places, used by Indians,—A Bridge could be constructed at this spot, of
30 feet span, at slight expense and labour.—From this Creek to Deep Creek, 6 miles, the Country continues low, the soil firm, the route crosses frequently little runs—connecting cypress ponds and swamps with the Oklawaha, which will render it necessary to causeway in one or two places—The banks of Deep Creek are so low, that it will be difficult to make a substantial bridge, and will require 10 rods causewaying on either side.-A Flat bridge, of about 40 feet, could be constructed, based on mud-sills and supported by braces to trees, above and below, and connected with the causeway, which would probably be the most durable, at the least expense of time and labour—It would require renewing, with every year, in the covering only.—Eight miles from Deep Creek this route unites from Wantons to Palatka, distant from Palatka 8 miles.—After uniting with this road there remains but one Creek to pass, over which can be thrown a Bridge of logs and poles that will answer every purpose.—The Country continues low & in many places covered with water in the rainy season, but the soil is so firm that no causewaying will be necessary.-After leaving Orange Lake Creek, another route might be had, by taking a direction a little E. of N. which would pass the Head of Deep Creek and an extensive cypress swamp, uniting with the road from Wanton's—distant from Deep Creek 8 or 10 miles, and from Palatka 20 miles;-three or four miles of the last 20, would be through a swamp, which requires causewaying, in any season, and is altogether impassable in the wet. No road can be obtained which will be serviceable when the streams are high.-A rough wagon road may be made, on the nearest route, that will answer for all the purposes of transportation in dry weather, in extent, for $499,99 $.400 supposing it to be cut by U. S. Troops.

Joseph D. Searight to James M. Glassell Copy FoRT KING, 27th Sept. 1827.
SIR, Pursuant to your order, dated 14* Sept. 1827,' I descended the Oklawaha as far as the places alluded to in the order.
Those places were examined, and another Channel discovered and cleared out for boats. This will obiate the necessity of using the narrow passage, which I mentioned, in a former report, as the greatest difficulty to be encountered in navigating the river. The Channel is in no place less than twenty inches in depth, or ten yards in width;
its bottom, in the shallower parts, is sand, in the deeper, mud. Very little difficulty will be found in pushing a boat through this passage, using the oars for poles. I imagine it is not a mile in length.
There are two sand-bars a few miles below this passage. The depth of water I found on these was sixteen inches. But, on account of the logs, in other parts of the river, a heavy boat, drawing more than ten inches water, could not ascend during the present low state of the r1Ver.
The water has fallen from four to six inches, since the first of June, and apparently is still falling.
That part of the river, of which I have spoken above, I have supposed to be about thirty miles from its mouth. This I do not now consider the worst part of the river. In my opinion it is within thirty or forty miles of Fort King. The stream, at this place, is narrow, not very deep, crooked, and full of logs, and continues so for several miles.
I have always found, where the water was less than two feet, a sandy bottom.
The quantity of logs, trees and snags in the river, is more than would be imagined. The trees on the margin of the stream are continually falling into it. I counted no less than thirty that had fallen within the last three months. I think I may safely say, that one hundred men could not clear out the Oklawaha in less than two months.
I have the honor to be, Yr. Obt Sº

SIR, I have received your letters dated the 6** and 7" insts * and in reply to the first, I have to inform you, that the Kings road is to be repaired under your direction from St Augustine to the point six miles north of the St Johns river, where Cap" Clarke commenced his operations in repairing the Northern Section of that road.
In reply to the second I have to inform you that in settling the the accounts of the expenditures on the Pensacola and St Augustine Road, there is a balance of about $554 which may be added to the appropriation for the bridge. In relation to that work you will observe the instructions contained in my letter of the 26* of last March,” not to commence until the right of Way be secured without expense to the public—If individuals choose to surrender that right to the public, or if the corporation or County Authorities obtain it and duly authorize you to proceed, you may commence the work either by Contract, or by the labor of the troops, provided you can obtain a sufficient number in the latter case you may consider yourself authorized to employ master mechanics, and others if necessary, to aid the troops, but you must distinctly understand that the whole expense of the bridge, causeways, and the continuing the Pensacola
<pb#964/>
Road into the City is not to exceed the balance of the appropriation
$5554.10
Report to me immediately, and fully, in relation to these subjects.”

<docbody>SIR. After parting with you off Havanna, I lost no time in repairing to Key West, where I arrived on the 25* Inst. On the 26* I gave notice, by Hand Bills that the Buildings belonging to the U States, would be rented on the 27" to the highest bidder for one year, payment to be made semiannually to the order of the Hon” the Sect” of the Navy, or the Commander in Chief of the West India Squadron.
The buildings were rented on the 27* agreable to notice, here enclosed, and marked A–I enclose you a Schedule of the building marked B
and the bonds, marked Nº 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. & 6. I advised with M*
Pinkney, the Collector, respecting the Stability of the persons renting the Houses, who assured me, they were the most wealthy persons on the Island, and good for a much larger amount.
In the further execution of your orders, I proceeded to examine the other public property, requiring my attention, and have to state as follows; Horses and Hogs I found none on the Island, belonging to the U. States.—As near as I could ascertain, there are ten or twelve cows running wild on the Island; these animals would be extremely useful to the Inhabitants, if sold, as they could easily be (again)
domesticated.—There are a great number of virginia pitch pine Spars, say one hundred, some of them have become injured by exposure to the Sun, and weather, but more than half of them are uninjured, and would sell well, as vessels would require them; but to expose them all for sale at the same time, would be sacrificing them to the rapacious Adventurers of Key West.—
1° Note disparity in figures.
<pb#965/>
There is about 2000 Bushels of Coal, laying on the Beach, above high water mark. This would sell best in parcels of three or four hundred Bushels each, as might be required for Ballast, or vessels bound to the U. States, without Cargoes, as is quite common.—There is a pile of Scantling going to decay fast, this will always sell well to the Inhabitants, for the purposes of building Houses wharfs, &C.. I did not think it prudent to dispose of any of the above mentioned property, on several Accounts; first, that my orders did not warrant such a responsibility, and secondly that I confidently beleive that most of the property may be disposed of at a much more advantageous rate to the U. States, if sold at such times as there may be a demand for it.—
I would recommend Mr. Pinkney, the Collector, and a Mr. Brown, Merchant, as men most deserving the Confidence of the Government There are many greivances complained of at Key West.—The Inhabitants are extremely annoyed, and the further Settlement prevented, by the pretensions of “P. C. Greene & Co.” who claims to be with his partners sole owners of the whole Island, and entitled to monopolize its Commerce.—By virtue of his pretended title, he has prohibited and prevented, the erection of Buildings, he has prevented the Inhabitants, from keeping Stock at large on the Island, for their Comfort and conveniance, from building wharfs, or landing Goods on the Beach, without paying wharfage.—
I understand several Merchants, at the Havanna, have expressed a wish to transfer their Capital to Key West, but are prevented by the uncertainty of titles to lots, and from the Apprehension of difficulties to be thrown in their way by the Firm of Green, who refuses to sell his pretended Claim.—
This Statement of Greivances is drawn from such information, as was offered me, by Mr. Pinkney and others at the Island; and I
regret to say that I beleive, many of the evils complained of do really exist.”—
I am very resp? Dº Sir Your Obt Servº

<docbody>GENERAL I have the honor to report that the troops from Tampa Bay & Pensacola will be here tomorrow, when I shall immediately commence the opening & repairing the Old Kings Road.
1° Meaning Dec. 13, 1826, ante, p. 688.
<pb#968/>
I have been over and examined the route from Colerain to Smyrna;-
the road can be repaired with little difficulty, as far south as Tomoka, but from thence to Smyrna it is perhaps, the worst country in the Territory to cut a road through, being composed almost entirely of low scrub & swamps;–there is not the slightest remains of the Old Road to be found, and I very much doubt, whether one ever existed;”
I and my guide were probably the only persons (except Indians) who have travelled over this part of the country for the last fifty years.
It is not my business to Judge of the expediency of repairing this part of the road, but of this, I am sure that it will not be travelled once a year, by any person, but will be permitted to grow up, and in two or three years will be as bad as ever;-and it will cost more to repair it, than all the rest of the route.
I am under the necessity of representing to you, General, the utter impracticability of my progressing in the repair of the road, to any advantage, under the existing orders of Gen' Gaines;–which is that the troops shall be relieved every two months;-besides the enormous expense of transporting the troops, as one of the detachments will always be coming or going, other, very important objections exist to it;-it takes troops a long time, to be instructed and accustomed to the work, and, under the existing orders, so soon as I get them instructed & well under way they will be removed, and I shall have to commence de novo, with a new set, which must necessarily much retard my progress;–besides troops, who know they are to be returned at a stated time, will care very little whether they work or not, where as, if they know that their return to their posts depends on their industry they will work with ardor so as to hasten it as much as possible.
I hope General, that these and many other reasons, which will probably strike your own mind, will induce you to make the necessary application to have this part of the order annulled *

wrote to the clerk of his court, that he would not be present to hold his term in May last. In consequence of this no witnesses were summoned, and no preparations were made for the trial of the causes then upon the Docket, (amounting to fifty one in number). Hence, (and owing, in some measure, to the additional fact that the laws of the last Legislative Council of our Territory had not yet been published) there was no business done at the May Term of the Court.
It is due to Judge B. to say, that the only ostensible ground for the motion, made at that Term, to continue all the causes was our destitution of the late laws. He arrived, however, not until the day before the time appointed by Law for the opening of the Court and it is easy to conceive into what inextricable confusion the business of the court would have been thrown, and what manifest injustice must have been done to many of the suitors, by his proceeding to try the causes on the Docket, even had we been in possession of the Laws Before Judge Brackenridge had been three months in the Territory, he again left the District and only returned to it to hold a court in a County 150 miles distant from this place.
The time for holding his court in November is now past, and it is convenient for him to be again absent. Thus we are left almost entirely without the administration of the Laws, for although our County Courts have in many respects concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Courts, yet in consequence of the fluctuations & frequent changes which our County Court system has, from time to time undergone, almost the whole business of the Territoy has accumulated in the Superior Courts Among the most prominent evils, arising out of the absence of Judge B. are the following
1* Persons charged with capital offences against the United States, lyeing in prison long after they should have been tried
2° Wessels coming into port with slaves on board and no manifest according to the act of Congress of 1807,” and the impossibility of getting an order of seizure
3° Officers in the service of the United States, bound in special bail to appear at Court, and yet liable at any hour to be ordered
<pb#971/>
away, and to be thereby subjected to the ruinous necessity of paying the amount in which they are bound.
4* A disposition on the part of such as have become special bail, to surrender their principals to prison, dispairing of relief in any other way
5* A general suspension of the criminal laws of the Territory.
It is true that Judge Brackenridge by way of excuse for his late purposed departure from the Territory wrote word here in September that he was not coming on in November because it was sickly in Pensacola and this though he had been already informed that the disease had abated and was disappearing entirely. Judge B. has been long enough in the southern country to know that in November there is very seldom the least danger from fever in this climate He knew, also, or ought to have known, that the 7" sec. of the Act of Congress of 1823, authorised him, in case this place should be visited by malignant fever, to adjourn his court to any other time or place;”
but the event proved that more than a month before the time appointed for holding the Court the fever had entirely disappeared.
Should Judge B's stay abroad now continue as long as his friends expect he will have been absent from the scene of his duties fifteen months in a year and a half.
I have given him notice of my intention to forward to you the foregoing statement against him.”

<docbody>SIR, Advices from the Deputies engaged in laying down the private claims in the west, induce a belief that they will Soon Complete their labours, and I regret to Say that they will not even Save themselves under their Contracts.
I have informed them that I am Authorised to extend their Contracts, as Some remuneration for the difficulties encountered, and shall in pursuance of Your instructions proceed to have executed the Surveys intimated in a former Communication *
The receipt of Your last instructions * will enable me to make my returns to your Office in a manner I hope entirely Satisfactory.
From a Careful examination of the law of the last Session of Congress relating to private Claims " I am not able to recommend any additional provisions that would have a Salutary effect: unless it can be amended So as to give an additional Compensation to the Surveyor, which from experience proves inadequate to the duties.
The additional labours imposed upon my Office without any Compensation attached thereto, Must be Submitted to, under a hope that time will be allotted for their execution Corresponding with the duties to be performed. To induce private Claimants to give the necessary information to the Surveyors, it will only be necessary I apprehend to give timely notice informing them that when they fail to attend or furnish the necessary evidence, that the lands will be Connected and Surveyed as public lands for Sale.

The funds Say $8.000. eight thousand dollars Contemplated for the Surveys to be executed will not be required before the 1* of March Next, provided the Receiver of Public Monies May have the amount on hand at that time.

SIR, There is no law which authorizes the selling of pamphlets for postage. Agreeably to the 2" article of instructions XVIII you should have notified the publisher of the death of Dr. Cosby on the receipt of the first number of the Recorder after his death; then it would have rested with him whether to have directed its return or otherwise.
The sending of accounts with newspapers as authorized in the 13”
Sect" of the post Office law, has no reference to pamphlets;* yet as publishers of pamphlets have generally conceived the priviledge as extending to them, it has never been the practice of the Department to enforce any penalty with out notifying them of their error and cautioning them against a persistence in it. The exact form prescribed in that section is seldom observed by editors, yet where there is no evident intention of violating the law, and when no injury is
<pb#977/>
done to the Department it is not deemed proper to enforce a penalty on account of the mere want of form *

communication, sufficient for every present purpose, that therefore the sum necessary for the completion of this route, might more advantageously be employed, in effecting a communication between the Matanzas and Hallifax rivers, which streams approach, at their sources, to within seven or eight miles of each other, and run through a well peopled and extensively cultivated district, where such a work would be of incalculable and permanent public benifit.—It is estimated that after completing the road from the Georgia line to Tomoka, there will be a surplus sufficient for carrying into effect the improvement here recommended, so that no additional appropriation for the purpose will be necessary.—This would at once lay open the rich sugar lands of the South to the benifits of navigation, while the Planters in that quarter would be enabled to Ship their produce with more safety through the Port of S’ Augustine, where there is a lighthouse and Pilots, and where the bar is deeper than that of Musquito, which forms at present the only passage by which they can transport their crops to market.—S" Augustine, the Capital of this Section of the Territory, would be greatly benifited by such a canal, as it would thus be made the depot for the produce of all the regions lying to the South of it and would be supplied with provisions of all kinds at a cheap rate & by a direct and easy channel of communication. There is another consideration that may be deemed worthy of attention by your Honorable body, that this work would tend to give access and an enhanced value, to the public lands in this quarter, where the soil is adapted to the cultivation of the best staples of the South, and where there exist large bodies of Live oak suited to the purposes of naval ship building.—
The obvious expediency of the measure, and the presence of their able Delegate, who can supply whatever further information may be wanted on the subject render it unnecessary for the undersigned, to enlarge upon these topics, or to tresspass any longer on the attention of your Honorable body.—They therefore subscribe themselves with due respect.

To the Senate & House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled—
Your petitioners having encountered insuperable difficulties in the location of the seat of Justice in Jackson County in the Western district of the Territory of Florida, whereby the greatest inconvenience has arisen and still exists, would pray your honorable body to pass a law authorising them to locate their county Site upon the sixteenth Section Township five, range Eleven N & W. & in support of this memorial would respectfully offer the following reasons—
That the said sixteenth Section is the only place suitable for said location on account of water, prospects of health & general convenience, which is any way central to the population of said County—
That other situations which would be suitable are so remote from the centre that the inhabitants cannot agree to a location upon any of them, & that every effort which has been made for two years past to effect a location has failed—
That a location upon the aforesaid sixteenth Section will meet with the approbation of a large majority of the citizens of the said Jackson County, & will effectually reconcile the jarring opinions &
conflicting interests—
<pb#982/>
That two successive applications have been made to the Legislative Council which have proved abortive.
That the two last Sessions of the Superior & County Courts of said County have been held on said sixteenth section, by universal consent, & to the general satisfaction of the citizens—
That there is already a village on said 16* Section, consisting of four stores, the offices of legal & medical men, clerks, sheriff & marshall
& several private dwelling houses—
That it will greatly enhance the value of the School lands, & produce a larger fund than by any other application of said lands—
And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray &c.”

<docbody>THE HON. JOS. M. WHITE. H. R.
DEAR SIR. It being impossible for me to give that examination to the bill left by you yesterday that the Subject requires. I would however suggest the propriety of substituting the 1. 2. 3.4 & 5 Sect"
of the Act passed on the 26 May 1824,” with the necessary verbal alterations in lieu of the 2° 3° & 4* Sect" of the proposed bill.
I do not know how far the proposed bill is intended to repeal the Act of the 26th of May 1824, so as to affect the decisions had under that Act, nor do I know whether there has or has not been an appeal from the decisions of the District Judge of Missouri given under that Act—but if there has been an appeal it would very much simplify of any & every tribunal, even Congress included, that might be called upon to act on the Subject if the points involved in the decisions referred to were finally acted upon and settled by the Supreme Court.
It is of high importance to the interest of the U.S. and the Claimants, as well as to the States & Territories in which the lands lie, that the previous claims to lands derived from any other source than that of the U States should be promptly acted upon and finally decided. To the several States and Territories and perhaps to the U.S. it is of more importance that there should be a prompt than an accurate decision as to these Claims; but it is due to the Claimants, that their Claims be judicially decided upon, and in such a manner as to afford them all the usual facilities of superintending their cases, and procuring the evidence that they may think necessary without extraordinary additional expense—how far these particulars are provided for in the bill, yourself & the Gentlemen representing the States &
Territories in which the claimants generally reside, can form a much more correct opinion than I can.”

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
21st Ulto with its enclosures.**
I beg leave to refer you to a letter from this office to His Excellency Gov" Duval, of 20" March last,” from which you may obtain information in a general way on the subject of the funds for the use of the Indian Department in Florida. I have to-day issued a requisition in favor of Gov" Duval, for $1,110,; and recommended the payment of Col" Humphreys bill, of 750$, for Salary, for the last two quarters of this year. His accounts are with the 2* Auditor. Gov" Duval, will doubtless make such remittance out of the sum paid to him as he may esteem proper. My letter of 20" March, already referr'd to, will explain why the sum paid is so small.
You will inform Col” Humphrey's that no future payment will be made on his bills if drawn direct on the Department. His accounts must pass through, and be adjusted, and reported by the Superintendent. I have in the present case deviated from this rule, fearing it might injure him to return the bill.
<pb#986/>
In regard to licensing Traders, it is required that the Superintendent, or agent, exercise a sound discretion as to the number of stands which it may be proper to authorize—these he will submit for the approval of the President, when licenses are to be granted under the terms of the act, the applicant giving satisfactory security &c. &c.
In regard to the question about Slaves, the title is understood to be in the Indian; and his right to sell or refuse to sell is not questioned.
But it is esteemed proper that no purchases be made either directly or indirectly by any agent of the Government in the service of the Indian Department; but an agent in the Indian Department should in all cases of purchase, or sale, so far as he may have the power, see that the Indian has justice done him, but he will not commit the Government in any way, either as to the title of the Indian to his slave, or in any other way.
I have the honor &c. &c.
THO" L. M*KENNEY.

This office is now and will very Soon be in want of Some Stationary which I will annex & which cannot well be procured here we have had Some blanks printed but the price is very high.
perhaps it would be better to Send from there the Stationary wanting including the Scrap books. if not I will according to the former instructions have them pasted on canvas they are as yet with very few exceptions in very good preservation. We are now in the Second week of our land Sale and the am" does not quite reach Two thousand five hundred dollars only about twenty tracts have been bid for nor have we from any thing we have heard any expectation of any more being bid for at the present Sale indeed there remains no more good land to offer there may be a Small quantity in the 5* Range S. & E. and in Some Townships which are not yet Surveyed ajacent thereto and near the mouth of the Ocilla these lands were not Surveyed owing to a very wet Season when it was attempted would it not be well to have all that remains unsurveyed on that part of the Coast ready as early as possible and offered So that the Settlement may extend on that exposed point also Some Small Islands which lie between the Ocilla and Sawaney Rivers. there are also in Various places among the lands hitherto offered Townships Sections & Fractions that Could not be offered because the lines were not Closed would it not be well to have those lines all Closed and ready to be offered at the next Sale? these reservations Keep us in perpetual danger of Committing errors in private entries. I enclose you a list of them hastily taken Subject to Correction from the maps in your office.
I take the liberty of suggesting to you the necessity of placing your Receiver & Register here on some better ground as regards Compensation for Keeping these offices. Which can be done under a law of Congress passed I think last Session providing for the Compensation of Registers & Receivers when they cease to receive any money for lands worthy of notice.” We are and have been for some time (as

our returns lately made and those to be made will prove) been left within a mere trifle of the Standing Salary of five hundred dollars the Receiver gives exactly that amount to his Clerk nor could he get him for that if he were not in the Rec' of a Salary under the Surveyor General I am paying mine about Six hundred the Contingent expenses of these offices. Rent. fire &º &" I am Satisfied in the time to Come will exceed our Commission on the receipts So that if things Stand as they now are it will make an inroad on our private means.
We of Course are the first to discover this and I do not hesitate for a moment to lay it before you the Sales that are passed, the preemption and Various donations amounting perhaps in all to near Two hundred thousand acres, have Completely disposed of the Country with the exception of mere Specks that remain and it is our opinion that no 30

<docbody>SIR Agreeably to your request I enclose herewith the draft of a Bill in relation to the reserved quarter Sections adjacent to Tallahassee,” accompanied by a Statement of the facts of the case and a diagram showing the reservations.
The error of entry made by Mº Mannings agent cannot be corrected by this Office unless it should appear by the Certificate of the Register
& Receiver that comes under the provisions of the Act of 3" March
1819.” and it is extremely doubtful whether it can be brought under that act as the error appears to have been made more from negligence than mistake I am &c:
STATEMENT.
George Walton as Acting Governor of Florida, by virtue of an Act passed on the 24" of May 1824.” selected the three following Quarter Sections of land adjoining that selected for the Seat of Government Viz: NE}% of Sec: 36. T. 1. R. 1 north & West: SW}4 of Section 31.
T. 1. R. 1. north & East; and the NE% of Sec: 1. T. 1. R. 1 South &
West; and advised this office of the same on the 16" of February
1825..," at which time no surveys had been received of those lands, and no entry or approval of those selections was made on the Books of this Office.
The Surveys were subsequently received and the Lands proclaimed for sale in the month of May 1825,”—On the 16" of March 1825, a
<pb#990/>
letter was addressed to the Register and Receiver from this Office "
instructing them “to reserve from sale a section of Land adjacent to the Lands which have been selected by the Lieut: Govt of Florida for the seat of Government, the reserve to be made in quarter Sections contiguous to the above mentioned Lands”. “You will avoid making the above reservation in any Township which may be selected for Gen' Lafayette should such selection be made adjacent to the Seat of Governm"?
Previous to the public sale in May 1825, the Selection of a Township was made by the President for Genl: Lafayette which adjoined the Town of Tallahassee and included the SW}4 of Sec: 31. T. 1. R. 1.
North & East, and a Patent issued to him on the 4* July 1825. for the whole Township "–
The letter from the Register & Receiver dated the 16. May 1827.”
will show that the reservation of the SW qr: of Sec: 31. T. 1. R. 1.
North & East, was withdrawn by the consent of the Lieut: Gov"
and the diagram accompanying it exhibits the present State of the reservations.
There is a mistake in this letter from the Register & Receiver in designating the NW qr: of Sec: 36. T. 1. R 1. West & North as one of the original Sections reserved by Mr Walton.”

<docbody>TO, THE HONBLE, RICHARD RUSH, Secretary of the Treasury, SIR, I have the honor to report to the Department the seizure made by me in this Port of 121 Slaves under the following circumstances.
Some days since the Spanish Brig Guerero from the Coast of Africa with a large number of slaves was chased by a British Government vessel from the Bahamas over to this coast. In the night the Guinea Trader ran on shore as did also the British Cruizer within 100 miles of this Port. The wrecking vessels Thorn Surprize & Florida Fish-
<pb#991/>
ing smack immediately repaired to the Spanish Brig & were by them forced to receive on board a part of the slaves and the crew (60 or 70
in number all armed) of the Guineaman, who immediately made all sail for the Coast of Cuba where they landed the Slaves. The vessels were given up to the American Captains and The Florida has just returned. The balance of the Slaves 121 in number were put on board the Sloop Surprize of this Port who has brought them here &
delivered a manifest of them. I have thought it my duty to seize them and now hold them subject to the disposition of the President.
I have placed them in charge of the Deputy Marshal here, and it is proper that clothing should be provided for them as they are nearly naked & liable to perish with cold. I have directed the Deputy Marshal to purchase provisions & sufficient blankets to protect them from the cold. I have notified the District Attorney of the circumstance, and will be glad to have the pleasure of the President conmunicated to me: The case is a novel one, and I trust that the measures I have taken may meet your approbation.
I beg leave to remark that the interests of the United States absolutely require the establishment of a Court at this Island having admiralty jurisdiction.” & I am convinced that a cutter placed under the immediate control of the Collector would be attended with the most beneficial results. Under the present arrangement not the least service has or ever will be performed by either of the Cutters Marion or Florida which latter vessel has not been in this Port since
10. October, & Capt. Doane with his usual disregard of his instructions sailed from hence the 7" instant for Sº Mary's. The interests of the United States on this coast have always been in great measure dependent upon this office, & I never can expect to receive any aid from the Cutters under the present arrangement.
I therefore respectfully request that the Cutter Florida may be placed under my direction and paid off in this Port, where she can always get a crew or ship them in Havana. I assure the Department that this measure should it meet your approbation will be of much importance in guarding the Revenue of the U. States.
I have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, Your obed" Serv"
W PINKNEY, Coll P. S. I enclose copies of the correspondence of the Commanding Officer of the Nimble & myself "who it will be perceived claims the slaves which were taken out of the Guineaman solely by the wreckers

<docbody>SIR, The establishment of a Mail Route from Pensacola to Mobile, renders the road you recommended last year a matter of much greater interest to us than it was before—The transportation of the Mail from the latter place to New Orleans has increased the facilities for travelling so far that all the Western part of Florida would go that way if the road was opened—I hope you have not abandoned the idea of having it opened without a special law—If so, I will endeavor to have one passed—as it would have the appearance of a great deal of legislation for Florida, & as the object is so small I would much prefer that you would order it to be done out of the Contingencies of your Department—I received a letter from Capt Burch by the last mail strongly urging the measure "—
I have received from several persons in Pensacola a Complaint that a Block house on the public square is used for a Powder house—It is represented that none of the U States stores are in it, but those of the Corporation placed there by permission of some of your officers—
They express a wish that you will give an order for its (the house)

<source>[NA:SD, Applications:ALS)</source>
<place-time>PHILADEPHIA Dec 26, 1827</place-time>
<docbody>THE HON: HENY CLAY. Sec. State, U. S.
SIR-I hasten to reply to the charges of M" Wright,” the District Attorney at Pensacola, which I assue you, have filled me with astonishment; and I trust, the President will see from the explanations, I am about to make, that they are unfounded and malicious.
It is true that I took advantage of the vacation, after the November Term 1826, to proceed to the city of Washington, where I had business, and thence came to this city, on an occasion, which delicacy forbids me to explain, but which, would be felt by the coldest
<pb#994/>
heart. The charge of M* Wright, presupposes, that it was a neglect of duty to be absent from Pensacola; if I were Mayor of the city, or Judge of the County Court, there might be some justice in the complaint; but as a territorial Judge, I had duties to perform, out of that city, and out of the district, which would have required me at any rate, to have left Pensacola after the court; and the discharge of those duties, or my own convenience, might have induced me to remain in some other part of the district, two hundred miles from Pensacola, or at Tallahasse, until the next term, that is, durg the whole period of the vacation.
Having held the court for Judge Woodward the year before, and transacted other business appertaining to his Office, to enable him, to go to Michigan to settle his affars, I had a right to expect, that he would in return perform similar services for me, under the law of the territory approved by Congress, authorsg the Judge of the adjoining district, to act in the place of the absent judge. Being informed, however, that I could not depend upon his going to Pensacola, I
determined to make evey exertion to reach that place in time, and had the good fortune to succeed. But I have no recollection of having written to the Clerk, that I would not be at Pensacola, much less that there would be no court, for I was certain that it would either be held by Judge Woodward or by myself, nor was any one authorised to give currency to such an idea, and I beleve no such idea ever did prevail. On the contray, the Marshall was directed by me, to summon Grand and Petit juries, which was done, and they attended. Nor do I beleve that any one neglected summoning witnesses, or preparing himself, under the belief there would be no court. It will be perceived that the charges of M" Wright, are founded upon the evils which might have occurd by my not holding the court, not upon what actually did occur. On my arrival, from a supposition that some inconvenience might be occasioned by my coming unexpectedly to some, I adjourned the court for a week, to enable evey one to prepare. At the end of that week, it was again opened, and I do aver that there was not a syllable of complaint for want of preparation, or of any confusion or inconvenience, occasioned by my absence, as is represented by M. Wright, nor was there the slightest ground for it.
Every Case the cousel were ready to try, I was disposed to hear, and all the cases in equity, admiralty, as well as indictmets, one of these a capital case, were disposed of. The cases on the civil docket were continued by their express consent, for the reason, that the law changing the mode of proceeding in civil cases had not been promulgated; and that this was the only reason assigned, or which could have been assigned. Mº Wright with that inconsistency, which is
<pb#995/>
peculiar to such minds, admits that these cases would have been continued, but that even if they had not been continued, such was the confusion occasioned by my absence, that they could not have been tried; here is a complaint founded on supposition, when in point of fact, it admits there was no ground for it. I ought not to be condemned for the evils which I might have occasioned, but for those which my conduct actually occasioned. I appeal to you, Sir, whether there is any candor, or justice, in this kind of accusation. The business of Pensacola, being almost exclusively confined to the city, for there is little or no population in the country, a few hours, would at any time have been sufficnt to collect parties and witnesses. I do aver that no such confusion as M* Wright speaks of, did occur, or was likely to occur. It is true, ther was confusion, but it was confined to Mº Wright himself, who had been endeavouring to injure me in my absence, and was disappointed in an opprtunty of preferring charges against me, which he had threatened. The motive of my absence at the time, was considered an ample excuse by every one but himself, and would have been, even if I had not arrived to hold the court.
The second charge, is, if possible, still more uncandid, and malicious.
Mr Wright states, that I had scarcely been three months in the territory, until I again left the district, and only returned to it, to hold a court 150 miles from Pensacola. Now, it is true, that my duties called me to the interior, and if they had not, the yellow fever would have driven me from Pensacola, as well as Mº Wright himself. But the truth is, that instead of travelling across the Country, threugh through the burning sun of July, I preferred going by water sea, and landed at S* Marks, whence I proceeded to Tallahasse and Chipola, where I did not find the district attorney, having about that time taken a trip to Louisville in Kentucky; but whether he had returned or not I am unable to say; nor was it of any importance, as his place was filled by a young gentleman of amiable manners, and promising talents, Mº Baltzel. To bring this charge to bear upon me, it was necessary for M" Wright to shew that it was my duty to reside in the district, whereas the act of Congress only requires a residence in the territory, having duties to perform out of the district, of as much importance as those within it. To shew that I have not only been anxious to discharge my duties, but also willing to oblige others, by performing these duties, when I thoght it might render them a service, I take the libety of enclosing a letter from Judge Randal,” for your persusal.
As to the last accusation, I trust my explanation will be equally Satisfactory. Shortly before the yellow fever had declared itself in
<pb#996/>
Pensacola, my wife and myself, had both been very ill; she had been at the point of death, but about the time she became convalescent, a packet vessel fortunately put into Pensacola, and considring it indespensible that she should go to a Northern climate for her recovery, I placed her on board, among strangers; and nothing but an anxiety not to be found wanting in my Official duties, prevented me from accompanying her. Late in the fall, I learned at Tallehasse, that she was dangerously ill, and from feelings which I trust, no man who wears a heart would consider criminal, although Mº Wright, in the narrowness of his soul, calls it consulting my convenience, I set off from Tallehasse, to undertake the arduous journey through the whole of the Southern States, but was unfortunately detained by a violent attack of bilious fever in Georgia, which prevented me from reaching this place, in time to take passage in the Schooner Orleans, Capt Munro as I should have done; the vessel havig sailed shortly before my arrival—But had I been so fortunate as to have reached the South, my duties would not have called me to Pensacola, and I should have been absent from it, during the whole vacation, and as it is, I shall probably be at Pensacola, some months sooner than if I had never left the territory.
As to my being absent at the November term, it is not true, that I was informed that the sickness had subsided at Pensacola; I had every reason to believe the contrary, and from my experence in the climate, which has been four times that of M" Wright, I am well satisfied, that it is never safe to venture where it has been, until after frost. But this was not the only reason assigned by me; M' Wright well knew, that the Marshall was dead, and that he had left no deputy, at Pensacola, there could be no jury summoned twenty days before the court, therefore no buisiness could have been done, even if I
had been there. Indeed, it was owing to this circumstance, that I
was induced to seize an opportunity of fulfilling one of the most sacred of private duties, when I thought it would be least detrimental to the publick service. And here, may I be permitted to remark, that this is the second time I have ever been absent from the territory during seven years; that in the discharge of my official duties, I never lost a term of any Court, where it was in my power to attend it; that I have performed an annual circut of one thousand miles, travellng at all seasons, in the rains of winter, and under the burng heat of summer, through a coutry almost a wilderness, with wretched accommodations, and often none at all; but not with impunity, my health has often suffered, in fact, I have not escaped a single summer, and twice, (in
1822, and 1825,) I narrowly escaped death—For the truth of this, I
confidently appeal to our delegate in Congress Mº White—to whom I
<pb#997/>
most respectfully request, the charges exhibited by M. Wright, together with my defence may be presented, that he may state his knowledge on the subject.
It is true, that the act of Congress makes it optional with the judge in case of yellow fever, to adjourn the court to some futue day. But no act of Congress can create ubiquity, and it might be necessary for me to be absent during the whole vacation in some other part of the teritory. As to the specifications of the district attorney, they are either of imaginary evils, which have had no existence, or they are of such a nature, as would occur even if I had not lef the teritory; they are entirely local, and my duties at this vey time, would have compelled me to be absent. I cannot, however, refrain from expressing my indignation, and disgust at the singular disregard to truth, in the ascertion, that I have ben absent fifteen months, out of a year and a half!
I trust, that from these explanations the President will be satisfied, that the accusations of M" Wright, have their origin in private malice.
I have long marked this young man's malignity towards me, but I
have most sedulously endeavoured by kind and conciliatory treatment, to overcome his animosity. It is a most painful circumstance, to be continually exposed to insult from a narrow minded, conceited subordinate officer, of stinted intellect. The Judiciary of the territory, is in fact the government of the terrtry, and unless its parts move harmoniously, the publick, as well as the private interest, must suffer. The charges, the occasion, one, on which no man of the most ordinary feeling, would ever bring forward even a well grounded accusation, the destitution of truth and candor on the face of them, the want of good sense which they evince, leave no doubt of the weakness, and wickedness of the accuser. Under a solemn sense of duty to myself, and of a like duty to the Judiciary of the territory, I most respectfully, but most earnestly, request, the dismissal of Mº Wright, from the office of district attorney. During six years, I have discharged my duties with unremitted attention, duties of great importance and various, for a salary which evey one admits to be moderate, and that there is no ground of complaint against me, in relation to the manner in which they have been discharged, is clearly proved by this very accusation, for if there were, one actuated by so much malice, could not fail to lay hold of them. An independent and upright discharge of the office of territorial Judge, in a state of society new, and composed of various materiels, must necessarily expose him to much enmity, and in proportion to the difficulty of his situation, ought to be the support of the governmet. But when a person who holds a small office from that governmet, can presume to treat a judge with indignity, endeavour to excite senseless clamor, against him, to
<pb#998/>
destroy his usefulness, I cannot but think, that it is indispensably necessary to give a salutary lesson, that may serve as a warning to others—The most beneficial results, have already ben expereced in this territory, from pursuing this course, and I do solemnly declare, that I beleve it can in no instance, be more so than in the present.”

HON. JOSEPH M WHITE
SIR I hope you will excuse me for calling your attention from your important trusts, and diverting it for one moment to the condition of our main Road from St Augustine, to Tallahassee. This road, you will recollect, was only partially constructed, the funds appropriated by Congress, for the purpose of compleating it, having either been insufficient, or improvidently expended by the Commission who had them charge; and such is its actual condition, at this moment, that it is impassable for wheel-carriages, and the communication which it was intended to produce, from the East to the West of Florida by a Main High Way, is, in this condition of the road, far from being attained.
The expense necessary to complete this road might be heavy, were it not for the circumstance, and it is for this reason that I now invite your attention—that the troops of the United States might be judiciously employed in the promotion of this object; as those stationed in Florida are now concentrated and employed, in completeing the highway from the North to the South of the Peninsula; and on their return Westwardly, from this operation, the completion of the road West-
<pb#999/>
wardly to Tallahassee, would be a work convenient for them, and in their way.
Notwithstanding this assistance however, to be derived from the troops, expenses could not be altogether avoided; and from communications I have had on this subject I am induced to beleive, that a fund of Eight Thousand Dollars would be absolutely necessary, in conjunction with this auxilliary, to open and complete the main road in question. And considering its importance, not only to the Territory, but to the Sinews of the United States, and the advantages of it with which you are intimate and capable of representing; I hope you will excuse me for asking your attention to it, and joining our fellow citizens in Florida in the hope that you may be successful in obtaining from Congress its sanction and assistance in so desirable an object.”

As far as Captain Poussin and myself have travelled this road, it seems to us that bridges and causeways are the main items upon which the improvements

Whereas, the Island of Key West and the port of entry at the mouth of Appalachicola are places entirely detached from the main settlement in Florida, and cannot well be protected by the civil authorities of their respective counties. And whereas the revenue laws of the United States are much abused at these points, for the want of prisons in which to secure persons guilty of misdemeanors, until they can be safely Carried to the proper authorities—Therefore Be it resolved that our delegate in Congress be requested to obtain, if possible, from that body, an appropriation sufficient to erect jails at the above places for the purposes mentioned—all of which is most respectfully submitted by the Legislative Council of Florida.”

<dochead>RESOLUTION OF THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</dochead>
<source>[NA: HF, 20 Cong., 1 sess.: DS 98)</source>
<place-time>[December 28, 1827]</place-time>
<docbody>Resolved, That the Delegate in Congress from the territory of Florida, be, and he is hereby respectfully requested, to use all proper exertions to procure the passage of a law, authorising the Sale of the lands reserved in this territory for the establishment of a Seminary of learning, and for the use of Schools; at Such times, and under such regulations, as the Governor and Council may by law direct.
In urging this request, a second time, upon the Consideration of Congress; the members of this Council disclaim all intention of manifesting a feeling of discontent, as respects the Course heretofore pursued by that Honorable body, towards this territory: On the Contrary, they have much reason to felicitate themselves on the munificence which it has ever seemed disposed to exercise, and do most sincerely appreciate the liberality with which their petitions have been regarded; but while they deny all intention, or even right to Complain, they nevertheless consider themselves entitled to the privelege of presenting, at all times to the Consideration of Congress, such alterations in their Systems and laws, as will, in their opinion, Conduce to the general advantage of the Community, which they represent. The subject proposed in the foregoing resolution, is one so important to the interests of Florida, and so vitally Connected with the growth and prosperity of the institutions, which it has manifestly been the object of that honorable body to encourage and support, that the members of this Council Cannot believe that an apology will be Considered necessary, for presenting it a second time;
indeed, they would Consider it an aberration from that strict line of duty, which their obligations to the territory, and to the Government of the United States impose, were they not again to present this matter to the Consideration of Congress, and to submit a few of the most prominent reasons, upon which they have predicated their opinions.
Congress, at its last session, passed a Law granting to the Governor and Legislative Council of this territory, the power to take possession of the lands, which are the subject of this resolution, and to lease the same from year to year, and appropriate the money arising from such leases, to the use of schools, and the erection of a Seminary of learning.”
* Printed also in A. S. P., Pub. Lands, V, 398–400.
* Approved Jan. 29, 1827, 4 STAT. 201–202. 378885–58–62
<pb#1004/>
In Countries presenting a dense population, and where the advantages to be derived from the Cultivation of the soil, depend upon the skill and Care with which it is managed, a system of leasing lands for a term of years, may be found to yield a profit, without impairing their value; but where there exists a sparse population, and where large bodies of unsettled lands are presented at almost every point throughout the Country; renting or leasing, especially from year to year will ever be found to render them worthless, without producing any equivalent.
Persons acquainted with the mode usually pursued by agriculturists in the Southern States, must be Convinced that a system of improvement, enters not into their schemes of policy; their principal object is to draw from the native soil, as large a product as it is Capable of affording, and when, from such a plan of Culture, it becomes exhausted, it is abondened for a more fertile spot—if this be the Course pursued by persons owning the soil, as in many instances it undoubtedly is, what have we to expect from those who have no permanent interest in it? Tenants from year to year, in a Country like this, would direct every effort to the attainment of the largest return from their labour, without regard to future Consequences, and when their leases expired, they would leave the lands in a state of premature decay and destruction.
Another important reason presents itself to the members of this Council, against the adoption of this system; it is, that the revenue to be derived from it, would not be sufficient to answer any valuable end—Woodlands, although Constantly subject to pillage and waste, Could not be rented for any price, and the Cleared lands would yield a very small sum, in Consequence of their not being Considered a fair subject for Competition. By Common Consent, the person who has Cleared a piece of land, known as public land, is Considered, in some degree, its owner, and no other person will oppose him in renting it; he therefore gets it at such price as he is willing to offer, and thereby obtains a privilege to Commit every kind of depredation.
For these, and other important Considerations, Connected with the object for which these lands have been reserved, the members of this Council, representing the people of Florida, Conceive that much injury will grow out of this system, if pursued. If it be true, that experience is at all times a safe guide, we greatly err, when we neglect to profit by its lessons; and in looking at Georgia, Alabama, and other neighbouring states, we find the worst results have followed the system of leasing the lands set apart for the promotion of literature. The lands have been found to deteriorate from year to year, and the proceeds have scarcely been sufficient to pay the expenses
<pb#1005/>
necessarily incurred, in placing them in this train of ruin and destruction.
An additional reason, not indeed directly Connected with the funds to be raised from these lands, has also had its influence with the members of this body, in inducing them to present this request, to the Congress of the United States. The territory of Florida is known to possess an extent of maritime frontier, surpassing in exposure any other portion of the union; it is also known to embrace an immense tract of Country, the most of which is of such sterility, as to present an insuperable barrier to settlement, and that its means of defence in times of invasion, must of necessity be less, than its situation requires. It would therefore seem, that every effort should be resorted to by the government, to invite within its borders, a permanent population, which would be identified with it in interest, and would be disposed to defend it against foreign assailants; but if the school lands, located as they are, in the best sections of the country, should be kept under a lease, this desirable object would be wholly defeated.
Persons who depend upon renting lands for a support, are generally of an unstable and itinerant Character, and having no permanent interest in the government, would be indisposed to promote it in peace, or defend it in war.
As the resolution herewith submitted, is only intended to request the passage of a law, authorising the sale of these lands, at such times, and under such regulations, as the Governor and Legislative Council may direct, it would appear unnecessary to suggest at this time, any mode for their future disposition; but as the success of this application may in some degree depend upon the Correctness of their views on this subject, the members of this body believe, that a full development of them, will not be Considered irrelevant.
Into some parts of this territory, a tide of emigration is at this time most rapidly flowing, and not a doubt is entertained but it will Continue to flow, as long as lands susceptible of profitable tillage, can be procured: and when all the good lands of those sections of Country are settled, emigrants will be directed to other parts of the territory, which have not as yet attracted their attention. To dispose of the school lands, therefore, upon the most advantageous terms, it is necessary that the Governor and Council be at liberty, to bring them into market, at such times as they will be in the greatest demand, from the influx of population, to the particular section of Country, in which they are situated. It is also Considered, that the most advisable plan to dispose of them, will be to sell them upon a Credit of, from one to ten years: the principal to be secured by personal security and a lien upon the land, and to bear a reasonable interest from the sale, 
<pb#1006/>
to be paid annually, to the Commissioners or Trustees of the School fund. By an adoption of this Course, it is believed the lands will sell for a price, greater than they would Command at any future period, and would yield an annual revenue in interest, infinitely larger than Could ever be realized from rents.
The members of the Council are well aware of the objections which exist to a sale of lands upon credit, but they are Convinced, that little reflection is required to shew that those objections Cannot apply to the school lands in this territory; the quantity to be brought into market at any one time, will be too small to invite foreign speculation;
they will therefore be purchased by persons settling in the Country, and the payment will be amply secured. Instead of their being ruined in the hands of tenants, by an improvident system of Culture, they will more likely be improved by owners, who will be looking to future benefits and advantages, and if from non-payment, they should, at any time, revert to the government, they will return with an increased value.
With regard to the fund to be raised from a sale of these lands, the members of the Council would only observe, that when Collected, it might be securely and advantageously vested in some stock, which would give an annual income, amply sufficient to carry into effect, the beneficent designs of Congress, in setting them apart.
In Conclusion, the members of the Council would respectfully remark, that if rules have been established by Congress, in relation to the disposition of the lands reserved for Universities and the support of schools, which are adverse to the request they now make; they can but hope, that the reasons here assigned, added to the peculiar situation of the Country in which they live, will be Considered as affording sufficient grounds for a departure from those rules, so far as the territory of Florida is Concerned.—

That the nature of the said titles is shewn in the printed exposition thereof which your Memorialists ask leave to annex hereto, and that it may be considered as an exhibit herewith.
That the original title deeds of the said lands have been submitted by your Memorialists according to law, to the investigation of the Land Commissioners appointed for this purpose by Act of Congress.
They have been by the said Commissioners examined, and their regularity and genuineness by them admitted; and the said Commissioners referred to Congress the question whether the said titles ought or ought not to be considered valid as against the United States."
That the said question of validity has for a long time laid over undetermined; and that the delay thereof has occasioned to your Memorialists serious injury and to some of them absolute distress, whilst the lands themselves being on the Coast of the Gulf of Mexico, a frontier situation and requiring population, lay uncultivated, unhabited, and useless to the proprietors, to the Territory of Florida and to the United States.
Your Memorialists therefore pray that the said titles may be taken into consideration, and that Congress may grant to them such relief as in it its wisdom may be thought fit And Your Memorialists will every pray ROBERT MITCHEL on behalf of himself and the other proprietors by his Agent PETER MITCHEL

MY DEAR SIR I presume by this time you have arrived at the Seat of Gov" and have fixed Madame & self comfortably & permanently for the session; permit me to congratulate you—& to pray you to bear in mind (if you can possibly spare time from the multiplicity of your political duties) that this one at least in this southern section of the Country who holds you in high esteem & regard, and who will be always gratified if you will give him some evidence of its reciprocity, by occasionally informing him how you & yours are and how they get on in the great world"—
On my last cruise I learned something of the character & settlement at Key West and as the representative of this territory I give it you, not confident however you will derive any original information from it but with the belief at least it might be useful—
You are aware that a person, named P. C. Green & his Copartners claim to be sole owners of the island and with this claim pretended or real, assume a monoply of the commerce, & therefore prohibit &
prevent the erection of any buildings, either houses or wharves &
exact wharfage for goods landed on the beach, nor will he or they permit cattle to run at large on the island although there are I learn

near 250 inhabitants who require whereºttire something of the kind wheaetually reeft for their comfort & better subsistence.
I have understood also there are several Merchants at Havanna who have expressed a wish to transfer their Capital to Key West, but are prevented from the uncertainty to titles to property & from apprehension of difficulties being thrown in their way by the firm of Green, who will not dispose of their pretended claims. I believe there is not a doubt if a certainty to titles could be made apparent, there would be an increase of population, & a valuable improvement in buildings & cultivation. I understand M* Green has proved the island is capable of producing in abundance all the fruits of the tropical climates—
You are also aware there are no civil magistrates on the island, hence the Lex talionis" is the law of the land by common consent.
You are also aware there is not on the island an admiralty Judge, of the imperious necessity for one I have no doubt you will coincide with me, when I assure you I have been informed & I believe the wrecks that occur on or near the island & that are brot in to Key West average one every week in the year, the amount of the property of these wrecked vessels is immense, Most of the wrecked vessels are foreign & bound from Jamaica & Cuba & Gulph of Mexico to Europe and as a portion of the proceeds of their cargoes go into the treasury of the gen" gov" as revenue the necessity of an Admiralty Judge is very obvious—the Custom now is to choose two disinterested Men as Arbitrators who decide the question of salvage the wreckers are entitled to, where there are conflicting interests such a mode must naturally be offensive to one of the parties, the several days of bad navigation to St Augustine together with the small draft of water on that bar, makes it impossible to carry the vessels & goods rased to this port hence Key West is the port they must resort to. the salubrity of the island is as good if not better than any in the West Indies of Gulph of Mexico, there was a stagnant pool in the rear of the town at the time our squadron under Porter rendezvoued then &
there together with the very great & useless exposure of the officers &
men & total want of system I have not a doubt were the causes that led to so many deaths, but since whieh a canal has been made so as
7 The law of retaliation, 
<pb#1011/>
to admit the ebb & flood of the sea into the pool the place has been entirely free from sickness & as a very good evidence of the fact Porter lay nearly a year at one time at that anchorage since he has been in the Mexican service without being at all effected by the diseases incidental to all tropical climates. Under all these impressions then I am convinced that with a little law & a good deal of justice & the land claims perfectly & immediately adjusted, this little island will become of much importance to the nation, If I were with you I could point out to you on the chart where a change in the rout of our vessels bound from the northern ports to the Gulph of Mexico, will soon take place, I mean vessels drawing not more than 13 feet water, by casting your eye over the chart of that part of the Gulph near Cape Florida, you will observe vessels drawing any water may go inside the bar & navigate inside to Key West in not less than 5 fathoms, thence they can proceed by Key West to the Northw" carrying 13 feet into the Gulph of Mexico shortening the distance 150 miles and avoiding the dangerous & treacherous navigation around the Tortugas.-I must not omit (as I have carried you so far into my prosing letter & perhaps told you every thing you knew before) to apprise you of one other fact of which I know you are ignorant & that is the rise of property at Key West, I last month leased by the year some houses belonging to the U.S. and that which only produced $180. p. annum rents this year $1760—one house alone & that about the size of a man of war's Cabin, rented for $1082–
last year it rented for $80—these facts speak for themselves.
As you must be sick & tired & as I am a little of the latter myself I
will close with many sincere wishes of health & happiness for you &
yours.
Very Sincerely Yr friend & Serv'.
CH. G. RIDGELY
Honblº J. M. WHITE.
There is nothing new in this vile place & cold weather set in &
health restored—I am in daily expectation of my family & am living in the house Brodie occupied, it is far up town but 'tis too the “West End.” 8

* The destruction of the incoming correspondence of the Post Office Department, presumably in the fire of December 15, 1836, which destroyed its building, renders it impossible to determine the date of establishment of the post offices in the Territory of Florida. The above list has been compiled from the volumes cited in the headnote. The entries in those volumes are not always complete, and others have become so badly faded that they can no longer be read. 1° Headings are editorial aids—not present in books 3, 4, and 5. Book 1 of the series, however, was headed Post Office, State, Postnaster, and Date of First Return. The names of the bondsmen are written in red ink above the names of the postmasters. The dates of the first returns in these books are the nearest that can be found to the establishment dates. Given in the books, but not listed in the table, are the dates of the bonds, which are generally close to the other dates. 11 Robert Mitchell was not the first postmaster at Pensacola. The Pensacola Floridian, of Aug. 18, 1821, contains a notice of the establishment of a post office at that place and of a regular weekly mail to Claiborne, Ala., the point of intersection with the eastern, northern, and southern mails. In the same newspaper appear a number of lists of letters remaining in the post office at Pensacola, advertised by the post master, Cary Nicholas, who was also one of the publishers of the newspaper. These lists appear in the issues of Oct. 8, 1821, Jan. 7, Apr. 13, July 27, 1822, and Mar. 8, 1823, over the name of Cary Nicholas, and others in the issues of Apr. 19, July 5, and Oct. 25, 1823 over the name of Robert Mitchell. The lists were usually advertised quarterly and appeared in several succeeding numbers of the newspaper. Similar lists were published in the Pensacola Gazette and West Florida Advertiser during 1824–1828. in The St. Augustine East Florida Herald, of Feb. 7, 1824, contains the information that the mail had commenced running between that place and Jefferson, Ga., in the previous week through Jacksonville, where John L. Doggett had been appointed postmaster and would immediately open a post office. :
* Lists of letters remaining at the post office at St. Augustine, advertised by the postmasters, are to be found in the following issues of the St. Augustine East Florida Herald: Apr. 5, July 19, and Oct. 18, 1823; Nov. 20, 1824; Jan. 25, 1825; Apr. 4, July 4, and Oct. 3, 1826. - 7822 | Tallahassee 17 Leon Ambrose Crane May 13, 1825 2,000 | E.

<source>[NA:SF, 20 Cong. 1 sess:DS ºl</source>
<place-time>|January 1, 1828)</place-time>
<docbody>Resolved, That the Delegate in Congress from the Territory, be requested to use his exertions to obtain the passage of a Law in that body, providing for the gradation of public lands in Florida according to their relative value; for instance, all lands that shall remain in market one, year, can be entered at one dollar per Acre, two years, seventy five cents, three years, fifty cents, four years twenty five cents, and after five years at the price of surveying such land with interest.”
In submitting this request and plan of gradation, to the consideration of Congress, the Legislative Council are not insensible of the liberality heretofore extended to the people of Florida in the purchase of public lands, and make their suggestions with all possible deference and respect to the better judgment of that body, and would beg leave to remark, that such a plan of graduation would be admirably calculated both to guard the interest of the general government, as well as to promote the interest of Florida, as there would be no additional expence attending such graduation and sale, and by which too, every one could become identified with the soil, it matters not how limitted his means might be.
Florida is not less exposed than she is conspicuous, possessing a Sea coast almost equal to any two States in the Union indented with Ship harbours and inlets affording a ready access to the maratime and naval operations of both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, hence it is all important in order to resist the hostile armaments of an enemy in time of war from possessing those points so vitally important, not only to Florida but to the whole Southern Country, that a dense population should be induced if possible to settle on the extended and diversified range of poor land spotted with small Hammocks, that constitute at least three fourths of Florida, which never will be inhabited at the present minimum price of public lands, but would soon present the aspect of cultivation and industry, should a plan of this kind be adopted. In all privileges of this sort the agriculturalist is to be exclusively benefited, forming as history and experience has taught mankind to be the nursing mother of a

happy country and the most solid fund for a nation to rely upon, for the support of their fiscal operations, particularly in a country like ours, where every man is placed in a condition to contribute to the end of his own happiness by throwing his mite into the national weal.
Thus it is the wealth of the citizen is manifestly that of the nation, and whilst property passes from the one to the other for a national consideration only, it clearly shows an additional avidity to labour after their own felicity All of which is most respectfully submitted JN L. DOGGETT

<place-time>Post Office, PENSACOLA 4* January 1828.-</place-time>
<docbody>HON: JOHN M*LEAN, P. M. Gen' Washington SIR, Conceiving that I might obtain useful information, with regard to the arrangement of the Mails at Mobile and Blakely, and be enabled to arrange our mails in the manner most beneficial to our citizens, by a visit to Mobile:—I accompanied the mail rider on Friday last left this place at 12 O'clock, arrived at Perdido that evening. 21. miles from the Perdido River to Hall's there is no house— 35. “
from Hall's to Blakeley (measured)— 14. “
making from Pensacola to Blakeley— 70 Miles.
This is five miles further than it is generally estimated, but I am confident, if it was measured, it would exceed, rather than fall short of my estimate. The present road is in many places very circuitous and might, with a trifling expense, undoubtedly be shortened 12 to 15
miles. Some persons think as much as 20. This is certainly very desirable and might easily be accomplished by the Troops at this place, if an order from the Q Master's Department to that effect could be obtained. I am informed that the Q" Master at this place has been instructed to survey the route, and believe he has performed that duty and reported the result, I therefore presume that the order may be obtained by your solicitation.
I have arranged our temporary Mail to leave here at 12 O'clock every Friday—arrive at Blakeley on Saturday night cross to Mobile on Sunday Morning & return to Blakeley in the evening—from whence it will immediately start on its return, and arrive here on Tuesday at 12 O'clock. This is the best arrangement practicable, in the present situation of the road. The Ferry Boat crosses every day from Blakeley to Mobile and returns in the evening, which detains the Mail nearly a whole day, & makes it impracticalbe “to go and return in three days.” All mails meet at Mobile on Sunday morning, that evening is therefore the best time for our mail to leave there, and
* Enclosed with a covering letter from Phineas Bradley, Post Office Department, to the Quartermaster General, Jan. 30, 1828. 878835–58–63
<pb#1020/>
it arrives here in proper time on Tuesday, to forward any packets, which may come in it, by the Mail, to other parts of our Territory.
It is my opinion that, without some clearing out of the present Road, the Mail cannot be carried with convenience, in a stage, even in the time now allowed—Still it is highly desirable that it should go in a Stage—and if a direct road is cut, it may be transported in one, still more speedily. This route, though not likely to be a productive one to the Department, is one which will afford much accommodation to the Citizens of this place and indeed of the whole Territory, in facilitating their correspondence with Mobile, New Orleans, and all of the States of Louisiana and Mississippi, and it has been suggested to me by several, both here and at Blakeley, that it would be very acceptable if the Department would allow two Mails a Week between the two places. Could this be done and the Steam Boat communication between Mobile and New Orleans be permanently re-established, the mails on the route would be increased an hundred times, and the intercourse between the cities and States above mentioned greatly facilitated.—
The expenses on the route, as now arranged, must be at least $14
a week to the contractor, besides the risk and wear of horses, and I
expect that competition will be such as to make bids lower than the contractor can make anything by—unless passengers in a Stage contribute to keep him. Should this be the case, I trust that it will be considered, in deciding on the request to allow two mails a weeks.-
My expences on the trip were eighteen dollars & fifty cents, respecting which I await an answer to my last; addressed to Mº Bradley.
Permit me to request that this letter may be shown to the Hon:
J. M. White, our Delegate in Congress; that he may communicate to you his views of the Subject.”—
Very Respectfully, your obedt Servt.

The Memorial of Sundry Inhabitants of Key West, most respectfully represent—
That by a provision of the 10* Section of “an act to provide for

<pb#1021/>
the collection of Duties on Imports and Tonnage in Florida and for other purposes” approved the 7” May 1822,” You will perceive that foreign goods, wares, & merchandise, cannot be imported from any port in Florida for the benefit of drawback “unless the same Shall have been imported directly into the Said Port from a foreign Port or place—
We cannot See any just reason for placing the Ports in Florida under those peculiar restrictions from which, Ports of United States are exempted; these restrictions operate with extreme Severity against the Ports of Pensacola and Key West, which from their local positions, are be:ter adapted for an advantageous trade with the Island of Cuba & the Ports of Mexico, than any other Ports within the Sovereignty of the United States, and they would in Our opinion enjoy a large portion of the trade of those Countries provided these restrictions were removed—As the Law now Stands, goods imported into Key West direct from a foreign Country, can be Shipped with debenture, but if transhipped Coastwise from New York to Key West this privaledge is denied:—It Cannot surely be considered advisable in wise legislation to retain a Statute, which merely gives trouble to the Merchant, but which can be so easily evaded; for example, goods are shipped from New York for Bermuda, the drawback forthwith attaches, and the debenture becomes effectual These goods then can again be reshipped, and arriving would as coming direct from a foreign Country be entitled to debenture, when reexported from Key West and the Merchants in their trade to the Islands and to the Maine would attain all the benefits they desire;—
Thus You see the Law can be most easily evaded, with this only inconvenience, that a Shipment via Bermuda would impose some additional trouble and expense beyond what would be incurred if drawbacks were admitted on Shipments made Coastwise from Ports or places in the United States—Any increased expense that can be avoided, Should be, because every increase of it will have a tendency to place us on terms of less fair competition with the Merchants residing at New Providence—The advantages to be derived from this trade is of more importance, than one who has not reflected upon the Subject, might at first conceive—The contiguity of Key West to Cuba and the Ports of Mexico, gives it in point of Situation a decided Superiority over other Ports of the United States for a trade with those Countries—
The Spanish vessels are in the habit of bringing Specie, Cochineal, Hides, Sugar Coffee &c. and in exchange require, large and various
383 STAT. 684–685. 
<pb#1022/>
Supplies of Articles, which they have been in the habit of procuring heretofore at New Providence and at Jamaica “–
So important have the British Government considered this Commerce, that for the last Twenty Years; free Port licences have been extended to the Spanish traders by which they are exempt from all and every sort of Port charges—But the proximity of Key West which is only about eighty miles from Cuba, a distance that can always be run in a night, induces those traders to prefer a commerce with it.
The passage is so short and so Safe, and withall every thing of risk from Privateers and pirates being saved, they will always prefer it while they can be Supplied with articles Suited to their purposes—
This tho, Cannot be the Case unless the prevaldge of drawback is allowed, for at present owing to the limited State of Capital and the facilities afforded at our home markets, importations direct from Europe do not take place—the Consequence is, that unless Congress grant the ef relief sought for, a great portion of the Spanish trade now so valuable to the Commerce and Navigation of the United States, must continue to go to the Ports of Jamaica & New Providence—
It has been urged that the arrangement Sought for be obtained would increase the Chances to fraud on the Revinue; and that an illicit trade from Key West to the United States might be the consequence—This certainly is a far fetched Suggestion and applies in point of probability no more to that than any other Port or place in the Country;-The Same thing might be imputed to Shipments for drawback from New York, Boston Pelad" or Baltimore and with much greater Seeming plausibility; because Key West being Contiguous to the Maine land in Florida where the population is few and Scattering precludes every inducement or attempt at fraud persons being never disposed to place property where there are none to consume and purchase it;-But besides this an ample and Sufficient answer to this objection is, that the Supposition of frauds of this character, goes to break down the whole doctrine and System of debenture; in as much as its feasibilities from any other Port, is just as great as it could be from Key West—
We offer this hasty sketch of our veiws upon this subject, not deeming it necessary to go minutely into detail, to ehe those so familiar with the Commerce and Navigation of the Country as you are;—
It is Submitted not doubting that when you shall have turned your

Your Memorialists would further state that after the arrival of the Nimble at this place they were desirous to effect an amicable and speedy Adjustment of the Salvage, and for this purpose proposed to Lieut Holland, the Commanding Officer of the Schooner, to submit the matter to arbitration, being the usual tribunal resorted to in such cases, but Lieut Holland positively refused to have any other adjudication than that of a Court of Admiralty.

Your Memorialists would further state, that when the depositions were completed, they sent them to Lieut Holland, for his perusal, under the expectation that he would, according to agreement, corroborate all the Statements contained in them, by his certificate or Affidavit, and return them; but to the great astonishment of your Memorialists, Lieut. Holland did not even look at the depositions, and in defiance of all law (there being no physical force in the Port sufficient to detain him) made Sail, and left your Memorialists without any compensation for their arduous toil, and expense in saving him and his Wessel & Crew from inevitable destruction. For the particulars of this transaction, from begining to end Your Memorialists respectfully call your attention to the documents herewith transmitted.”
Your Memorialists would further represent, that a p(MS. torn] of the Negroes taken from the Wreck of the Brig, were carried to Cuba and the residue brought to this place, and delivered over to the highest Civil Authority on the Island, to be disposed of according to law—
that they were and still are, entirely ignorant of the mode of proceeding prescribed by law in such cases, and that they adopted this course as being in their opinion the correct one. They would further state, that they have been informed and believe, that the Collector of this Port Wm Pinkney Esq." either has or intends to set up a claim against the United States for the bounty allowed to Citizens for Capturing of Wessels laden with Negroes from the Coast of Africa, thereby assuming to himself the attitude of your Memorialists, and excluding them from all benefit or emolument (if any there be) arising from the Capture, if it may be so called.
Your Memorialists would further state, that if they have proceeded illegally in regard to the Negroes, it is attributable only to their ignorance of the law, regulating the subject, as will appear in the opinion of your Memorialists to your entire satisfaction, from the papers herewith enclosed, and to which they beg leave again to refer, for the particulars in relation to the Negroes.

<place-time>WASHINGTON Jamy 6, 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>HON” J. C. ISACKS Chairman of the Committee of Public Lands.
SIR. Having understood that your Committee have before them a bill, the object of which is to grant two additional quarter sections of land in the vicinity of Tallahassee to the Territory of Florida,”
I beg leave through you to place before the Committee, a Statement of facts in relation to the reservations made under an act of Congress entitled “An Act providing for the Seat of Government in the Territory of Florida, and for other purposes”, approved the 24” of May
1824.50
In accordance with the act referred to, the executive of Florida selected the South East Quarter of Section 36 in Township One, Range One North and West, which is now the site of Tallahassee, and the late acting Governor George Walton, during my temporary absence from Florida, selected three other quarter sections of land adjoining the same, as directed by the act of Congress: a copy of
<pb#1027/>
his letter to George Graham commissioner of the General Land Office, dated Feby 16** 1825 is herewith transmitted.si The Committee will see that the whole Section authorized to be selected in pursuance of the act aforesaid, was located long previous to the selection and location of the Township of land granted to General Lafayette by the United States. None of the quarter sections thus reserved for Florida, were claimed by any person at the time of the location.
The whole country around the seat of the Government, up to the date of General Lafayette's location was open and could have been reserved from sale, with the single exception of the quarter section on which I resided, and which could not under the Act of Congress have been taken for the Territory, as it did not adjoin, but only cornered on the South East extremity of the quarter section on which Tallahassee is established.
In the month of February 1825, I visited Washington, and was solicitous that Congress should give four other quarter sections of land, as I understood it had been the practice to grant two sections to the Territories, but the Session was drawing so near to its close, as to preclude the hope that a law could be passed before the dissolution of Congress. I called on the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and requested that four additional quarter sections might be reserved from sale, as I hoped Congress would ultimately grant them to the Territory, and orders to this effect, I believe, were transmitted to the Register and Receiver of the Land Office at Tallahassee.” On my return to Florida I found that the quarter section of land which I
had settled on and inproved in the Summer of 1824, previous to any locations whatever, and months before a Surveyor had appeared in Florida, was during my absence reserved from sale. This reservation however gave the Territory no claim to the land I had settled; and under the preemption law passed by Congress to secure to actual settlers their improvements,” I claimed with justice the quarter section on which I had built and resided in the year 1824.
The Honorable M' M*Kee * of Congress selected for General Lafayette a Township of Land adjoining Tallahassee on the East, thus covering one of the quarter sections that had been previously located by the acting Governor as described in his letter of the 16” of February
1825,” It is believed the Township granted by Congress to General Lafayette was not designated by his agent until April 1825.”

<pb#1028/>
Under the preemption law before referred to, as one of the first actual settlers, I made application to the Register and Receiver of the Land Office to permit me to enter the quarter section of land on which I had resided, but under the peculiar circumstances of the case, they thought proper to refuse the entry. My petition was presented to the Honorable A. B. Woodward for a mandamus to compel the proper officers to admit my right, and after a full examination of the evidence and an elaborate argument by counsel for and against my claim, the Court decided that I was entitled to the land, and ordered the Register and Receiver to permit me to make my entry, as I had a right to do under the preemption law. This was done, and all the papers in relation to my claim was transmitted to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and I have understood my claim has been sanctioned by the Department.” If I am mistaken in this fact (for I cannot say positively) it will be easy to obtain the information from the Land Office.
It may be proper also to state that all the papers on which the Court acted in my case were submitted by me to the Legislative Council of Florida, at their first Session after the decision, to enable them to prosecute the case if they believed the Territory had any claim to the land. The Council, believing that my claim was valid and just, refused to direct a further prosecution. Unwilling however to see the claim of General Lafayette lessened even one quarter of a section, I
offered to surrender my land & houses to the Territory, if the Legislative Council or Congress would pay me for my improvements, so as to enable me to build another dwelling even as rude as the Hull I now inhabit. I flatter myself that the Committee will grant four quarter sections of land to the Territory,” in addition to the section given by the Act of May 1824, if it has been usual to allow so much to other Territories, and the generosity of the Committee will never permit them to grant less to one Territory than they have bestowed on others.
Should further information on this subject be desired, on application to M' Graham, it will no doubt be promptly furnished.
It may not be improper to state that but for the house I erected at considerable expense, no other could have been obtained sufficiently large and dry, in which the Public business could have been transacted, and the records and papers have been safely preserved.
I solicit you, Sir, to assure the Committee that however just my claim may prove, I would rather surrender the land and my humble dwelling without compensation, than see the Territory deprived of one acre of land by any act of mine. If the Committee shall consider me

as his letter to me of the 18th of Decmº 1827 will shew—(herewith transmitted).”
The letter or petition seems to have been written and witnessed by a cirtain Stephen Richards—who was formerly the Interpreter for the Florida Indians, but his conduct was so improper, and he was so much in the habit of violating the law—respecting the intercourse and trade with the Indians—that I felt it my duty to dismiss him from the agency—This was done in accordance with the expressed will and at the request of John Blount, (who is made to sign this petition) and the other chiefs—
Richards is known to be destitute of character and is in fact considered as a most unprincipled man by the honest citizens who know him—No statement he can made will be entitled to credit, unless it is supported by respectable evidence.
Since the location of Mº Phagan on the Appalachicola River this man Richards has been prohibited from trading with and cheating and taking from the Indians their property, and I entertain no doubt that it has been owing to this improper conduct, and deceitful influence that the chief John Blount has become so refractory. This M*
Richards has been labouring everer since Majº Phagan, settled among the indians to destroy his character and influence with them It may be necessary to remove Blount down into the nation, in the manner provided or directed by the late Treaty if he does not conform to laws provided for the regulation of trade, and the Government of the Indians " -

house near to, and improving the navigation of the river Sº Marks.”
From the great increase of population in Middle Florida, her exports will soon be considerable, and can only find their way to market through the port of Sº Marks. It is Stated by gentlemen acquainted with the bay of Appalachee and the river Sº Marks, that vessels drawing fifteen feet can approach within five miles of Fort S* Marks. –
From the Devils Elbow, as it is called, to the fort, the channel at two points is obstructed by rocks which can be easily removed. Six or seven thousand dollars, from the best information, would effect this desirable object.
The whole country from Little River in Gadsden county, and for twenty miles east of the Ocilla River, a distance of Sixty Seven miles, must depend on S' Marks as their only port.—The Ocilla River Sinks near the Gulph of Mexico, and passes under a natural bridge of limestone, which is a barrier to navigation. A Survey of this natural bridge will demonstrate that a Small appropriation will remove the obstruction.
The interest of that part of Georgia which is Situated north and east of Tallahassee will be as much benifitted by the improvement in the navigation of S' Marks, as any part of Florida, for it is their only outlet to the Gulph.
I trust you will be able to Satisfy the Committee who may report on your resolutions,” of the advantages which will result to the country generally, by effecting objects So useful.

The Committee refer to the following statement marked A. from the Commissioner of the General Land Office" (Insert it) *
It appears from the above statement, that one of the Quarter Sections directed to be located by the Acting Governor * was within the Township subsequently selected for General Lafayette, and the local authorities in Florida not being willing to interfere in any manner with the munificent grant of Congress to that illustrious Patriot consented to withdraw their claim to that Reserve, which being previously appropriated might have been held by them.” In the selections afterwards made for the same object one of them included the Quarter Section on which Governor Duval settled in 1824 and to which it was adjudged he had a right of preemption by the Judge of the District under an Act of Congress passed in 1826 giving the right

of preference in the purchase of lands to settlers te Settlers prior to the 1* Jan’ 1825.” Whether this dicision was correct or not the Committee do not deem it their Province to inquire: to obviate any difficulty however the Committee have received satisfactory information that Governor Duval offered to the Legislative Council the Quarter Section in question after it was adjudged to him, upon their paying him for the improvements actually made by him.
The Territory of Florida will have by the bill now reported the quantity usually granted in other places for this object with the exception of this Quarter which they can acquire upon such just and reasonable terms, that if they do not accept them, the Committee conceive no further grant ought to be made by the United States.
They do not doubt however that this claim will be arranged between the Governor and the Territory in a way satisfactory to both without any legislation on the Subject.
Upon the subject of the Third Section of the bill, the Committee refer to the petition marked B and made a part of this Report.”
(Insert it)"
The Laws of the United States give to each County in the Territory the right of preemption to a Quarter Section of land,” the reasons for a change are fully set forth in the foregoing representation:
the County will be enabled to select the Quarter they desire by a transfer of the same quantity for the same use for which that was reserved, whilst the interests of the inhabitants are carefully protected.
It is a question in which the United States have no direct interest:
no land is asked for, or granted: a commutation which can only be effected by our law, is afforded for the convenience, and at the application of a large number of inhabitants.
The Sixteenth Section of each Township, it may be necessary to remark, is reserved for the use of Schools, one Quarter of this is to be exchanged for another Quarter to which the County is entitled, and the Committee do not doubt that the remaining three Quarters by the location of the County Seat would be more valuable than the whole, even if another was not transferred for the same object.”

The Country between S*Augustine, on the Atlantic, and Pensacola, on the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of four hundred miles, is so thinly peopled, as to be wholly incompetent to improve and repair the Military and post road connecting these points, so essential to the protection of the Territory of Florida. They are at the extremes of a line passing the military post called Cantonment King, deemed essential to the security of the infant Settlements in its vicinity, from the neighboring Indians, and that of Tampa bay, as well as by the town of Tallahasse, the New Capital of the Territory of Florida. The importance of the road connecting these positions, is illustrated by the past experience of the Federal Government, in

victualling and transporting its troops; and was the foundation of an act of Congress of 1824,” appropriating 28,000 dollars for its construction. This sum, spread over a distance of four hundred miles, then, unmarked even by a hunter's path, was indeed, inadequate to its object. Still, however, the subjoined letters” evince that much must have been effected by its expenditures, since a very moderate sum is now recommended as sufficient to provide for the most essential repairs of the road. (See letters marked A. & B.) The Committee are assured that, before the Bill which accompanies this report and contains an appropriation to the above object,” shall be taken up in the House, a report will be received from the Engineer Department,” demonstrating the practicability of completing the navigation referred to in the first and second sections of the same bill, by the sums, of which the Committee recommend the application to this object.
Relative to the importance of an improvement of the Channel between Amelia Island and the Continent, the Committee beg leave to refer to House to a report on the same subject from the Committee on Roads and Canals, made to the House at the second session of the last Congress.”
The obstructions proposed, to be removed in the navigation referred to, in the second section of the bill are described in the Engineer's report in relation thereto,” which accompanied the first message of the President at the first session of the 19* Congress;

Seat of Justice for Jefferson County, thence to Hickstown Madison County, thence to Micco town in Hamilton County, thence to Dills, thence to Black creek, thence to Jacksonville thence to Sº Augustine, and from the Agency by the way of Wontons to Dills.
The reason which the Legislative Council offer for this change is first because the present rout goes through a dreary unsettled Section of Country missing several of the principal settlements and seats of Justice for many of the counties in this territory. Secondly, because it is the impression of the Legislative Council that the proposed rout will be equal if not shorter than the present rout between Pensacola and Sº Augustine, and besides that it will be of eminent advantage to the citizens of the Territory.

<dochead>REPORT OF LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS</dochead>
<source>[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Seminoles:Pr.]</source>
<place-time>[January 17, 1828°]</place-time>
<docbody>The Committee on Indian Affairs; by their Chairman Col. Dell, made the following REPORT, which was unanimously adopted.
The select committee on Indian affairs, to whom was referred that part of the message of the Executive, recommending “that Congress be petitioned to make an appropriation to defray the expense of an expedition of the chiefs to the country set apart for them,” ” have the honor to REPORT:
* See post, p. 1027.
* Enclosed in Del. White to the Secretary of War, Apr. 16, 1828.
* The date is supplied from FLS (Fla., Terr. Legis. Council, Journal, 1827– 1828 in LC, Recs. States U. S., A. l.c., Fla.).
* Message of Acting Gov. McCarty, Dec. 10, 1827 (loc. cit.).
<pb#1037/>
That the subject having been already anticipated by our Delegate in Congress, they do not conceive it necessary at this time to renew the request.—Notwithstanding, the committee are perfectly aware of the advantages to be derived to the Territory, by the removal of the tribes to their destination, beyond the Mississippi, and of the injury she has sustained by their present location.
The same committee who were directed under a resolution of the Council “to enquire into the present situation of the inhabitants of this territory in relation to the Indian tribes within the same, and the probable causes that have influenced said tribes not to be removed out of the country” have the honor to report: That during the last year, with some painful exceptions, the Indians have been confined within their boundaries; these exceptions, it is believed, arose from an open violation of the laws of the Territory, prohibiting them from roaming at large. To whom this blame is to be attached, it is not for your committee to say, but hope hereafter, more vigilance will be used by the proper authorities, to prevent similar occurrences.
Your committee have further to state, that much complaint exists in the country, on account of the reluctance with which runaway slaves among the Indian tribes have been surrendered by the proper authorities to their lawful owners. Whether this zeal to retain property in the nation arises from an over solicitude to protect the unfortunate red man, or is to be attributed to other motives, your committee have no documents before them to prove. But that there is complaint, a reference to the numerous letters on file in the war office at Washington will declare. Your committee further state, from such information as common report of facts, which they believe susceptible of legal proof, an illicit traffic is carried on and countenanced among them.
The probable causes that have influenced said tribes not to be removed, your committee conceive are to be traced to interest and unwarrantable interference on the part of those connected with them.
It is further believed that their removal, an event intimately connected with the prosperity of the territory, will not be effected, until different sentiments are diffused among them.
Under this view, your committee recommend the adoption of the following resolution.
RESOLVED, That a copy of this report be forwarded to our Delegate in Congress, requesting him to submit the same to the consideration of the proper authorities.

<dochead>SIMON BERNARD TO DELEGATE WHITE</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 1 sess.:ALS"</source>
<place-time>[January 18, 1828)</place-time>
<docbody>Gen.” Bernard has the honor to present his respects to M' White, and, in answer to his note of the 16** instant,” to submit the following remarks and valuations.
Two water communications might be openned between S* Mary's harbour and S" John's river: one for boats through what is called Inland-Passage, and which, on account of the numerous, short and narrow windings, could not admit of the passage of sloops unless large expenditures should be made. The other should be a thoroughcut canal from Belle-river to a branch of Nassau river, and would form a link of the line of the contemplated inland-navigation along the coast: the expense of its execution will be considerable.
In regard to the former, or present existing communication, the points where the tides meet are those that require improvement.
The first obstruction is found between Sº Mary's and Nassau and consists of a shallow channel, two miles in length, left dry at low tide, and affording about three feet at high-tide. To improve this channel to a depth of four feet at common half tide and on a width of thirty feet, the expense would be about . . . . . . . . . . . $8.600.
The second obstruction, between Nassau and Talbot-inlet, is seven hundred yards in length left dry at low-tide: to improve this channel to a depth of four feet and on a width of twenty yards it would require about . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $3.300.
The third obstruction, between Talbot-inlet and the Sº Johns, on a length of four hundred yards, has but one foot water at low-tide; to improve this place, it would take about . . . . . . . . . . . . $1.400.
The fourth and last obstruction is at the Sisters: it is a narrow bar, which would require for its improvement about . . . . . . . . . . $340
Therefore, to render the Inland-Passage navigable, throughout, at half-common tide, for boats drawing more than three feet six inches, an expense amounting, at least, to $13.440 dollars will be necessary.”

our lands were disposed of to the highest bidder and we, left to seek another home in the wilderness.-As the object of the preemption law, was to secure a home to the poor—And as the rest of the Territory have, and will, receive the benefit of that law: We humbly request that Congress may extend to us, the right of removing our preemptions to unsold lands—We are all and but few in number that have been unfortunate in loosing our preemptions—We therefore feel confident, that your Honorable Bodies, will now grant to us a right, which you intended should extend in the first instance to us; but which we lost not by any act or neglect of our's, but by the intervention of an Act, of the Government—Your Petitioners will &.C.

<docbody>HoNo” JAMES BARBOUR, Secretary of War SIR It is believed that Congress will provide the means to further the removal of such tribes of Indians as may consent to go west of the Mississippi—I have no doubt but the Semminolees can be induced to emigrate, and I beg permission to state how this may be effected—
Co” Thomas. L. M*Kenney. is better quallified to suceed in this measure than any other person, and if he can be sent to Florida next spring. he will do more to conciliate the Indians and satisfy them, of the advantage which will attend their change of residence, than all the commissioners you could select. My acquaintance with the Indian, habits customs and disposition, authorize me to say—that Co" M*Kenney, is not surpassed (if he has an equal) in, all that relates to these extraordinary people
* See post, p. 1021.
<pb#1048/>
I do not believe that the humane object of concentrating the red people, as submitted by you in your luminous expose to congress * can be so cirtainly executed to your satisfaction and the general, interests of the nation, as by calling into action, actively the services of M*
M“Kenney—He has during last year rendered invaluable services to the country—in aiding in negociating with the Indians several treaties of great importance—Is it usual in the several territorys to appoint the Governors as one of the commissioners in treating with the Indians—This I do not desire—if M'. M*Kenney is sent—no other ought to be appointed—The little influence or services that I can render shall be exirted, and given as freely as if I was united with him—and my desire is that it may be executed, with the most rigid economy The Semminolee nation, are poor & miserable and if not removed will in a few years become extinct. Their preservation & happiness, demand the change more than the interests of Florida—though it is admitted that the growth and prosperity of the Territory depend in a considerable degree on the removal of the Indians "

<place-time>PENSACOLA January 28, 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>HONB° RICHARD RUSH Secretary of the Treasury SIR, Many applications have recently been made to me, to ascertain whether I would clear out Live Oak and Cedar Timber, cut from lands occupied by persons entitled to the right of preemption, under is 
<pb#1049/>
the Act of Congress, of the 22. April 1826;” To such applicants, I gave for answer that, although the Law gives them the right of preemption, yet, that the absolute right to the Land cannot vest in them, until it has been regularly brought into market, purchased at public sale, or subsequently entered, and paid for; that until this was done, The right remains in the United States. When your convenience permits, I will be gratified with your opinion on this subject.
Some complain of my being unnecessarily rigid on this subject, as well as on the nature of the evidence required, of Timber being cut from private Lands. It has I understand, been the custom to permit idle vagrants, who have no regular home, or stake in society, and who are generally employed as labourers to bring Timber to market, to take their testimony, that the Timber has been cut from private Lands; such testimony I consider, to say the least, of a very equivocal nature. Almost my first act was, to let it be distinctly understood, that such testimony would be rejected by me, and that I would require the evidence of some respectable free-holder, properly authenticated before a judicial officer; the consequence has been, that hardly any Timber has been brought to this place, since I have been in the office. There are many settlements, valuable only for the Live Oak hammocks on them, and if the Timber was destroyed, both the Land and Timber, would be lost to the Government, and the right of preemption would never be claimed.
There has for several years past, been great devastation and slaughter of valuable Timber, and I have no doubt but most of it was from public Lands, and it is much to be regretted, that this waste of valuable Timber, is generally confined to that which is most valuable to the United States, being on convenient water courses, affording every facility of transportation, whenever the Government may require it. It becomes the serious duty of every officer, to nurse and protect an article, so essential to the wealth and prosperity of our country. If I have, in this conscientious opinion of my duty, done injustice to any individual, I much regret it, and it will afford me pleasure to corrected.”
I have the honor to be with great respect Your most Ob" Sº "

<source>[NA:PO, PMG Letter Book Tj POST OFFICE DEPART Jam. 29. 1828</source>
HoN. Joseph M. WHITE Ho. of Rep A few days Since I recº a letter from the P. M. at Tallahassee on the Subject of the currency which should be received for postages.”
He stated that he had formerly been in the habit of receiving notes of different Banks, and had sustained a loss in consequence of it.
The answer given him is the same which has been uniformly given to Post Masters in other places; viz, that a P. Master is not bound to receive any other money for postages than what is current with the revenue officers of the U. States. It always affords me great Satisfaction to accommodate the wishes of the Citizens of any community;
but the United States knows of but one currency, and for the proceeds of the Dept, its head must account in that currency. Should a Post Master be directed to receive other currency, and a loss should be sustained, that loss could not justly fall upon the P. Master, and the accounting officers of the Treasury would not admit it to the credit of the Dept. To assume this responsibility in one case, would involve the necessity of doing so in others; and the consequence would be ruinous.

<docbody>TO CO'JOSEPH M WHITE, Delegate in Congress, SIR, The public road now making from Camp Pinckney, Georgia, to Musquito, under the Superintendance of Lieut Brown of the Quarter masters department is nearly completed.
The work, So far, has been accomplished to the entire satisfaction of this community: no road at the South, it is Said by those who have had opportunity for comparison, is Superior to it—and it will remain a permanent benefit to East Florida.
The bridge, over the S* Sebastian's, we are informed, is Soon to be erected, and it is an object of great interest to the whole of this Section of Florida—We therefore earnestly request of you, to use all proper exertions to obtain from the department of war an order, charging Lieut. Brown with the Superintendance of this work, and that it be executed by the troops now detached on the road, aided by the Company of artillery, in garrison at this post—And then we shall feel assured, that the bridge will be well and durably built, in a manner corresponding with the importance of the object—
We have Solicited your particular attention to this Subject, as our delegate, because we understand, that otherwise, the bridge may be built by contract, which will not only more than double the expense, but we shall then fear, that we may Suffer, as heretofore, in the construction of public roads in the territory, where the unfaithfulness of the contractor, has nearly or quite defeated the munificent intentions of Government in our favour—
* Fractional Township 4 of Range 11—fractional township 4 of Range 12— Township 4 of Range 13—fractional township 5, of Range 13—and Townships 4 and 5, of Range 14 South, and East, which are embraced in this proclamation were again proclaimed, on the 8th March 1839.-See Record of the Proclamation Volume 2 pages 50. 51.52 and 53.

<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled The Petition of William Hasell Hunt respectfully sheweth, that he has for the last two years held the Office of Clerk of the United States District and Superior Court for the Western District of Florida:
That a Law of the United States approved May 26th 1824, entitled
“An Act to amend an act entitled ‘an act to amend an act for the establishment of a Territorial Government in Florida, and for other purposes’ ” provides, that the Clerks of the United States' District Courts in Florida “shall receive, in all cases under the laws and constitution of the United States, the same fees, which the Clerks of the District Courts of the next adjoining States receive for similar services.”* That your Petitioner is credibly informed and well convinced, that the Clerk of the United States' District Court for the Territory of Orleans, and for the State of Louisiana has uniformly charged, been allowed, and received, a per diem allowance, for every day said Courts has been held, of Five Dollars. Your Petitioner is further well informed and believes that it was the intention of Congress, at the time the law was passed which is quoted above, to allow to the Clerks in the Territory of Florida the same per diem compensation as the Clerks in other United States' courts have always been allowed: Nevertheless Your Petitioner most respectfully represents that he has never been allowed or received one dollar as a per diem allowance or compensation for attending the United States' District

& Superior Court of West Florida as Clerk thereof—but that his accounts therefore, though regularly examined allowed and signed by the Hon the Judge of said Court, have uniformly been disallowed &
rejected, on settlement of the Marshal's accounts at the Treasury Department.
Your Petitioner further states and represents that during the two years which have elapsed since he received the appointment of Clerk as aforesaid the profits of said office have not amounted to the sum of Three hundred Dollars for the whole time.
Your Petitioner, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prays that a law may be passed, allowing to your petitioner the sum of one hundred and seventy Dollars, which is justly due to him; as will appear by reference to the accompanying account. And that by a law which cannot be misunderstood or misconstrued, the Clerks of the United States' Courts within the Territory of Florida, may be placed on a footing with the Clerks of other United States' District Courts on the subject of per diem allowance.

seventeen feet about. From the shallow bay of Vacasausa to Mobile Bay, over the bar of which there is a depth of sixteen feet at low tide, Pensacola and S" Joseph's Bay are the only harbours of importance to our national navy. on account of a greater depth at its entrance, and of being more easily defended by land batteries, Pensacola has a decided advantage over Sº Joseph's Bay.”

SIR, In reply to the enquiries Contained in your note of this date,” I have the honour to inform you that the opinion of the Department which has heretofore been expressed in relation to the importance of fortifying the harbour of Pensacola remains unchanged—
Recent examinations have only served to confirm this opinion, and to demonstrate the superior advantages which this Harbour is found to possess over all others on this Coast, as a site for a naval deposite.
The Bay of St Josephs, which was at one time supposed to possess advantages superior to those of the Harbour of Pensacola, has been particularly examined during the past year by a member of the Board of Engineers, and is found to have a less deposite of Water on the bar than can be carried into Pensacola.
The Department feels satisfied therefore of the urgent necessity of providing for the defence of a harbour, the security of which will

prove of the utmost importance to our Naval establishments on the Gulf—

<place-time>WASHINGTON CITY March 5 1828</place-time>
<docbody>SIR For the purpose of showing to your Honorable Committee, the necessity of establishing a court of Admiralty & of general jurisdiction at Key West—that is, of erecting an additional Judicial District in Florida, to include within its limits, the Islands and Keys, and Such portion of the Southern extremity of the Peninsula, as may make a convenient division of the present district of East Florida, I beg leave respectfully to Submit for your consideration, the following facts and Statements, Key West, from its general Geographical character and relations, and from the existing population within the contemplated district, must doubtless be considered the only eligible peint point, at which the court can at present be directed to be holden,_ -
Its remote position, forbids the idea, that it can in practice, receive any judicial benefits from the either of the three courts which have already been established in Florida viz at Pensacola, S' Augustine &
Tallahassee, the former place being nearly six, and the two latter upwards of four hundred miles distant, It is therefore at present, 
<pb#1067/>
and will continue to be, unless a court is established there, completely without the benefit of law, because beyond the reach of its judicial administration Key West, with the Southern portion of Florida is already too important, while it is rapidly advancing in consequence, to be suffered to remain in this unprotected and lawless state—Its commanding position on the Gulf, not only with respect to the vast commerce which is carried on between the Mississippi and the Atlantic ports of the U States, but as to Cuba also, and the whole sea board of Mexico & Central America—Its valuable Harbor, its important trade, which, if fostered by Government, may be increased to an Amount which I should be unwilling even to name to the Committee—Its advantages with a proper court, to guard and regulate the immense wrecking business of the Florida reef & coast, and in that way, to subserve the interest of humanity and of commerce, are each of them, considerations that may well be urged on the attention of Congress.-
At least two hundred vessels from various domestic and foreign ports, enter the Port of Key West every Year, and the Revenue collected there and actually paid into the Treasury since the year 1823
amounts to $63.276.18/100 while all the other ports of the Territory has only paid, since the commencement of the Government in 1821, the sum of $6,792-64/100, making a difference of $56,483.54/100,”
Besides which there is at least from three to four hundred thousand Dollars worth of wrecked property brought into that port every Year which cannot be disposed of under existing circumstances, without giving great dissatisfaction to the parties concerned.—The valuable fisheries also, of that coast, should not be forgotten, There is at present upwards of thirty fishing smacks, owned by entirely by American Citizens, engaged in carrying live fish to the Havana Market, which brings into our Country at least $75,000.00/100 annually in specie—
Beleiving that the propriety and advantages of the proposed Court, not only to Florida, but to the U States and to Commerce generally, are so evident when presented to view. that the brief sketch which I have given, will effectually recommend the subject to the Consideration of the Committee—I will not longer intrude upon their time in respect to it
* These figures are in Secretary of the Treasury to the President of the Senate, Dec. 19, 1827 (S. Doc. 10, 20 Cong., 1 sess.), which contains a statement by the Register of the duties collected in Florida for the period 1821 through the third quarter of 1827. St. Augustine collected $13,875.27 and paid $2,031.38 into the Treasury. Pensacola grossed $43,158.71 and paid $4,631.68 to the Treasury. Key West which was not included until 1823, collected $153,259.82 and, as stated above, paid $63,276.18 to the Treasury. Apalachicola was not reported until 1824 and grossed $530.61 with $129.58 paid to the Treasury. 37.8835–58–66

* A letter from Simonton to Del. White, Mar. 20, 1828, published in the Pensacola Gazette and Fla. Advertiser, Apr. 18, 1828, states that White had no agency in the repeal of the territorial law imposing tax on sales at auction which had been suggested by himself (Simonton) to the Judiciary Committee of the Senate. A letter by White, Mar. 22, 1828 (ibid.), explains the annullment of the same law and the abolition of the port of entry at Key West and states that he had testified before the Committee on Commerce that either the port of entry should be abolished or a court established to prevent smuggling.

to the great disadvantages they at this moment labor under in Consequence of the entire obstruction in the navigation of the Apalachicola river, owing to the enormous quantity of logs and trash collected in an elbow of the river, fifty miles above this place; rendering it impossible for boats to pass and repass; and the three steam boats on the river all now above said obstruction descending with Cotton, and vessels now here waiting for the same.—
Your memorialists humbly petition your honorable body to grant an appropriation of five thousand dollars to be expended in removing said obstructions and others preventing the free passage of boats to and from this place.—
Your memorialists would not under ordinary circumstances, presume to petition for aid;—yet conceive the present, a Circumstance which demands the immediate attention of the national Council, as thereby a facility would be afforded.
The Commercial intercourse between this place and the back Country, without which, an interruption to the regular trade of the place, must, we Conceive, for some time remain Cut off-As the history of the Country furnishes no similar Case in said river that we have knowledge of.-And believing as we do, the territorial treasury destitute of funds, whereby aid might be afforded; was there any law authorizing the same—And your memorialists as in duty bound will ever pray &C—

SIR. I return to you the letter of M* White covering a memorial to the President relative to the location of the Lands granted to the Deaf & Dumb Asylum,” with a memorandum referred to the Laws having any bearing on that question. The order for location issued from y' Office,” and we have no copy of it.—
Mr White is mistaken as to the mode in which the selections have been made under the Act of 1827.” Such locations have been strictly confined to entire sections.
Mº Allen the Agent for the Ky Asylum who lately arrived here having expressed a wish to present a paper on this subject, has occasioned the delay in returning M* White's communication—that paper has not however been yet received; he informs me that he will send it in tomorrow or next day.”

[Enclosure]
Memorandum by George Graham Memorandum for the SecY of the Treasury.
The term of “a Township of Land” as a description of a grant of Land by Congress, is susceptible of several interpretations.
1st. It may be a quantity of land six miles square, the exterior lines of which might run to any point of the compass.
2" It may be a quantity of Land equal to 36 Sect" see L U.S. Vol 6.
p 374 24 Sect.” & the Act therein referred to.—
<pb#1071/>
3’d In its most limited and technical sense, it is a body of land containing 36 Sect" numbered from 1 to 36 inclusive, and bounded by Township lines of the public Surveys When however Congress has granted a Township of Land to be located, according to this restricted sense of the term, the word
“entire or complete” has been uniformly used.—See the Resolution of the old Congress granting “one complete & entire township” to A H. Dorhman for services rendered to the U.S.” Land Laws p 198.
The act granting “one complete township” to the State of Ohio L U S vol 3 p 543. Sect 4.”—
The Act granting “an entire Township” in the three following Ditricts Detroit, Vincennes, & Kaskaskia. L U S Vol 3, p 598. Sect 5.”—
The act granting “an entire township” to the Territory of Louisiani, L. U. S. Vol 4. p 36. Sect 7.”—
The Act granting “thirty six Sections or one entire township to the State of Alabama. L U.S. Vol. 6 p. 383. Sect 6.”
The Act granting to the State of Missouri “thirty six sections or one entire township L U S Vol 6. p. 458, Sect 6.”
The Act granting to the Territory of Florida. “An entire township”
in each Land District. Act 17 Congress, p 51. Sect 11.”
The Act granting a tract of Land to Gen' Lafayette designates the grant as “one township of Land” to be laid out and located under the authority of the President in any of the unappropriated Lands of the U.S.82
When this Act was passed it was the general impression that the Land would be selected in Florida a very small part of which Territory had at that time been surveyed; if the word “entire” therefore had been inserted in the Act it would have confined the location to the lands actually surveyed or would have deferred it until the Land intended to be located should have been regularly surveyed.
On the passage of the law it was therefore decided that the term Township of Land as used in that law, was not be taken in its most restricted sense, and in deciding on the manner in which it should be located a reference was had to the only case which the Law afforded of a grant of a Township for a similar object, to wit, that to A H
Dorhman, and directions were given to confine the location to a

Township of the public surveys if the Lands selected by the Agent should have been surveyed, but if they had not been surveyed, then to confine the location to a body of Land six miles square, with the lines running to the cardinal points. This township was however located on one that had been previously surveyed as public Lands.
The Act granting a township of Land to the Kentucky Asylum for teaching the Deaf & Dumb, approved the 5* April 1826 Laws 19
Congress p 24.” directs its location in one of the Territories on Lands to which the Indian title had been extinguished and in each of which Territories there was a large portion of unsurveyed Lands. Its location was not confined therefore in express terms to the public surveys.
The act making this grant, as it passed in the H of Rep* limited the location of the Land, by express words to an entire body, but this part of the Act was stricken out in the Senate. Under this view of the question you decided that the terms, one township of Land as used in that act was susceptible of its most extensive & liberal interpretation—and on reference to the only law which had granted a township of Land for a similar purpose, to wit, the act approved on 3° of March
1819 * L U S vol 6. p. 398. granting a township for the benefit of the Deaf & Dumb Asylum of Connecticut, you issued instructions from your office for making the location of the township granted to the Kentucky Asylum in conformity to the mode designated by the Act granting a township of Land to the Connecticut Asylum.—

<docbody>GENERAL, Having examined the Country between this place and Mobile Bay, with a view to opening certain Roads therein, conformably to your orders, I enclose herewith a sketch of the country,”
having marked on it such Routes as are already used as Cart Roads or Bridle paths; and such as are proposed to be improved. It is not to be considered that this sketch has the accuracy of an exact survey.
The outlines of it are enlarged from other Maps, and the details filled up by myself from personal knowledge of the country; and may serve to give a tolerable idea of its principal features.—The

<pb#1075/>
Map itself contains so many notices of Routes & of places that there is but little left to state beside, except in explanation.
The whole country between this and Mobile Bay is a sterile Pine Barren, without a single plantation's space of good land; and is consequently entirely unsettled, excepting here & there a family whose only business it to raise stocks of Cattle, on which they depend for support.
First are the Roads to Mobile Point. That from Pensacola to Mobile Point is strictly a Military Road, and when opened, will be used for Military purposes only.—The nearest as well as the best Route for this Road is to cross the Perdido at Innerarity's and Bear Point.—This route is nearly a direct line & will not exceed 55 miles in distance. It is about 25 miles from this place to the extreme end of Innerarity's point, the country, is flat, low and wet, but perfectly firm, pine woods, & will require only one Bridge, at the little Bayou near Cant Clinch, over which there is now a Bridge.—The remaining streams it crosses are in considerable rivulets & having sandy bottoms require no bridges. From Bear Point, the first fifteen miles is over a very high, sandy, open Black Jack Ridge, which extends itself along the coast, varying from half a Mile to a mile in width, between the Lagoons along the Seashore & the low, flat, pine woods back:—the next eight miles is over the same kind of sandy Ridge, but the growth is an almost impenetrable thicket of scrub Oaks—and the remaining five miles will be along the Sea Beach. This part of the Route is intersected by no streams whatever.—There is no person to keep Ferry at this crossing place, nor is there ever likely to be one except in time of war.—But as there is a ferry a few miles above, called “Pancho's ferry,” I have traced out that for a Road, for present travelling by that ferry.—You will notice that the old spanish Road leads to this place; & from thence I have marked a trail to be opened by Miflin's Mills, to interesect the Road proposed from Blakely to the Point, which it will do in about twelve miles from Pancho's. This Route to Mobile point is about Sixty miles—not much longer than the other but will require four considerable Bridges in that distance of twelve miles. These Creeks however are but seldom swimming, though in heavy rains they are swolen, especially Soldier's Creek and Mill Creek, into torrents but being short they run down in a few days time, & then become easily fordable, therefore it would be unnecessary now to expend the time & labor to bridge them.—The Road from Blakely to Mobile point must necessarily pass down as marked & intersect that which is proposed to go direct from Pensacola by Bear point near eighteen miles from the Point; consequently there will be but one to open for that distance; and moreover after they thus join the Route will be through the scrub growth before described, 
<pb#1076/>
and which will be more trouble to clear out than ten times the distance of open Pine Woods. The Route from Blakely will be on the Ridge between the waters of Perdido and Mobile Bays; and crosses no streams requiring Bridges except the Bay Minette, over which there is now a Bridge. This Ridge loses itself near the Head of Bon Secour Bay & the Road then enters on flat, low & wet, but firm, pine land for six or eight miles until it strikes the black Jack Ridge, before spoken of, near the sea coast.—The distance from Blakely to Mobile Point on this Road will be about Sixty five miles.—
Second, are the Routes to Blakely.—of these there are three;—first by “Panchos ferry,” and which continues for near fifty miles along the old spanish Road leading to the “Willage” where there was a ferry formerly to cross over to Mobile. The distance to Blakely on this Route is about Sixty miles; the first thirty miles being of the flat Pine woods & the remainder a high dry Pine Barren. There is but one Bridge upon this Route;—being the same with that where the Road from Blakely to Mobile Point will cross the Bay Minette—
Indeed it would be the same Road for near thirty miles of the distance.—The distance by this Route from Pensacola to Blakely is about Sixty miles.—
The second Route is by “English's Mills & Blunts ferry.” This Route has once been travelled but is now abandoned; and is not to be thought of as a route for the Road.-Ten thousand dollars expended on it from here to the Perdido would not make it as good a Road as that which now leads to “Owen's ferry” on the Perdido is, in a state of nature.--It is however the Route which has had most favor with many of the people here because it has been represented as being the shortest; but those who entertain these opinions have in general no personal knowledge of it whatever; nor of the country generally.—
It is undoubedly shorter than that by “Owens ferry,” but it is about the same distance as that by “Pancho's ferry.”
The Third Route is by “Owens ferry, Bell fountain & Halls.”—
This Route is a high dry Ridge requiring no Bridges, & crosses no stream but the Perdido River.—The distance on this Route is about seventy five miles; and is now the only Road used for travelling in carriages between the two places. Although this Route is the longest, yet as it is a good Road, practicable at all seasons, & not liable to be interrupted, by having a wide ferry, as is the case at Panchos, which could not be passed in windy weather; it has a decided preference over either of the other two Routes. moreover opening & straightening it will abridge the distance materially.
The shortest Route to connect Pensacola & Mobile being about fifty miles is the old spanish Road terminating at “the Village” on
<pb#1077/>
Mobile Bay & would require very little labor to clear it out; but the want of a ferry here; and the great advantage of a permanently established steam ferry Boat making a trip daily between Blakely
& Mobile determine that to be the most suitable pont for the Road to terminate at:-Besides the regular mail route goes to that place.
The intercourse to be carried on by means of these Roads, when actually opened & put in order is very little indeed; and as there are no merchantile transactions between the places will ever be limited.
Therefore no great expense should be incurred in opening them.
Whatever may be done on any of these Roads by the Military, will so remain; and if streams be crossed and bridged, there are no Inhabitants to keep up the Roads in the same condition; and in two or three years at farthest when these bridges get out of order, travellers would be forced on the old Routes.
I would myself recommend only, that if any thing be done, the Routes should be properly blazed out & the immediate trace of the Road cleared of all obstructions by Logs &" and making passable causeways over boggy places, if there should be any such places:–
In short to make nothing more than practicable country Roads, such as is done by the Inhabitants themselves when opening Roads through their Pine Forests.-Experience demonstrates that a Road opened to any width by cutting away the large timber, unless it is very much used, grows up to be in a year or two a thicket of Pine & oak Bushes.—
It is not probable that there will be during a period of Peace, any intercourse with Mobile Point from either Pensacola or Blakely except as a Bridle way for Persons on horse back; and but seldom travelled in that way even.—But between Pensacola and Blakely there will always be travelling in carriages, therefore it would be proper to bestow the most labor & pains on this Route.
If, however, any, or all of these Routes, be opened in manner only as I have suggested, an army may at any future time hereafter, be marched over them accompanied with their baggage, at the rate of Twenty miles a day; by having a body of fifty Pioneers moving in their front.
All the Routes which are proposed to be traced out & opened in this manner, are marked on my sketch with a line of red ink.-
I have not made any estimates of the expense of opening these Roads; for the whole cost of opening such Roads if done by the troops stationed here, and under the orders of the Comº Officer, Col” Clinch, would be so inconsiderable as not to be felt in the expenditures of the Quarter Master's Department, and would be hardly worth notice for a special appropriation on account of the expense the Dep" would incur.—I have on hand all the Tools necessary; and a part of the
<pb#1078/>
Transportation, the remaining part of which would be hired at a very small expense. And I estimate that two working parties of
25 men each would complete the whole in a month's time.— The distances are as follows viz:—
From Pensacola to Blakely by way of “Owens ferry” is 75 miles From Blakely to Mobile Point--------------------- is 65 —“—
From Pensacola to Mobile Point by the way of Innerarity's and Bear point-------------------------- is 55 —“—
From Barrancas to intersect this Road.-------------- is 10 —“—
From Pensacola by the way of Pancho's ferry to the intersection of the Road from Blakely to Mobile point----------------------------------------- is 27 —“—
From Barrancas to intersect the Road to Pancho's ferry------------------------------------------ is 7 —“—
From Pancho's ferry towards Blakely to intersect the Road from thence to Mobile point---------------- is 18
Total distance 257 miles You will notice on my sketch the vestiges of a Canal marked as existing between Bay John and the little Lagoon, near to Mobile point.—This canal has never to my knowledge been spoken of before or noticed by any one and was shewn to me by one of the old residents of the Country who informed me that there was no account or tradition whatever respecting it among the oldest Inhabitants; so that it must refer itself for its history to some former period before the occupation of this Continent by the present race of white Inhabitants.-The distance between the Bay John and little Lagoon where this canal or ditch connected them, is about half a mile; The timber has grown up in it as large as elsewhere, and where it passed across the Black Jack Ridge, the sand has nearly filled it up, though it is very plain even there; in the Marsh on the Margin of the Bay John, it is more plain; and in the Hammock on the margin of the Lagoon it is some five or six feet in depth.-There could have been no object in such a canal unless to connect the waters of Bon Secour with Perdido Bay for Boat navigation; and I found it to be the opinion of those persons who have their cattle in that Range & know the Country, that the “Little Lagoon” connects itself with the “Cross tree's Creek,” & so forms the Communication with the Perdido.
And from the Perdido to the “Grand Lagoon” (which is connected with Pensacola Bay at Barrancas,) there is a low portage of Two miles only.—
It is almost inconcievable to those who are not personally acquainted with the Country, how easily and at how little expense, the waters of Mobile Bay might be connected with those of Pensacola, for all pur-
<pb#1079/>
poses of Steam Boat navigation; & even for Schooners of respectable size & burthen.—And I think that the facilities which would be obtained to commerce by such a communication, will before many years cause its being carried into effect.”—

CHARLES F. SIBBALD TO DELEGATE WHITE
[Sibbald, Docs. in Evidence:P 88]
PHILADELPHIA, March 10th, 1828
DEAR SIR,--I this day have been favoured through your goodness, with a perusal of the bill introduced by Mr. King,” and “twice read”
in the Senate of the United States, “supplementary to the several acts providing for the settlement and confirmation of private land claims in Florida,” ” that such a bill will pass both houses of Congress, and become a law of a country, famed for the liberality of its laws and justice, I cannot for a moment believe: the interests of individuals to be sacrificed, in violation of a treaty, which should be sacred, and where the faith of the Government is pledged for its just fulfilment!
I can speak feelingly on a matter which will so deeply touch my interests, acquired after a residence of sixteen years in Florida. Now at an expense of nearly 44,000 dollars say forty-four thousand dollars, actually expended in the improvement of property, obtained long prior to the date of limitation, the 24th of January, 1818, from the lawful authorities of the King of Spain,” in confidence of that right
* See White to the Quartermaster General, Dec. 18, 1828, post, vol. XXIV.
* The document here reproduced is an unpaged one bound with Charles F. Sibbald, Documents in Evidence of a claim of Charles F. Sibbald [Philadelphia], 1837, which is part of a larger collection on this claim in the Dept. of Justice Library.
* William R. King, a Senator of the United States from Alabama.
*0 Senate Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 194–195; the bill was ordered to lie on the table on Apr. 1 (ibid., p. 269). See also House Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 263, 766. A letter from Del. White to E. B. Gould, Feb. 28, 1828, relative to this bill appears in the Pensacola Gazette and Fla. Advertiser, Apr. 11, 1828.
* Sibbald claimed a water sawmill grant of 16,000 acres of which 2,000 was on Bowleg's Hammock, 4,000 in Turnbull’s Swamp, and 10,000 on Trout Creek (S. Doc. 76, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 10–11; H.R.S., Fla., Spanish Land Grants in Fla., W., 78–79).
<pb#1080/>
to concede what then belonged to the Spanish Crown, I have improved those lands as my own; and my books of accounts can be produced, to show the correctness of what I assert. Perhaps there is no other individual who has expended so large a sum based on the faith and justice of the Government. You will recollect, perhaps, from my last communications on this subject, that I have a Grant for 16,000 acres of land, divided in three different surveys. Now it is proposed by this bill to allow me (a league) 5700 acres, in one survey, 5700 acres of pine land which the Government would sell me for a less number of dollars. Moreover, to show the inconsistency of such a bill, I
would observe, that in fulfilling the conditions of my Grant in the first place at the expense of 10,000 dollars, with interest, I built a water mill at the back line of one survey; and recently a steam mill in the front line, as per the annexed; which are more than a “league”
apart. Would the gentleman of the Senate wish to deprive me of either the one, or the other? For I have a right to the whole, or none.
I only ask any one to take this, as a case in point, to themselves, and it will show the injustice of such an act.
If possible, I will visit Washington during the next week, and I
think by a personal interview with some of the members of both houses, I will be enabled to get a separate bill, or to have some influence, as a person largely interested, in preventing the one in its present shape from passing. I am certain, very certain, however, it will be resisted by you to the last. Begging you will excuse the manner in which I have hastily expressed myself on this subject,”
I am, dear Sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, CHARLES F. SIBBALD

<docbody>HoN RICH" RUSH Secy of the Treasury.
SIR, I return you the communication of M Webb “referred to this office with sundry papers and letters in relation thereto numbered from 1 to 3.
* See White to Graham, June 26, 1828, post, vol. XXIV.
* A copy is in NA(TD, ST, Lets. from GLO to ST, Bk. 7).
* Mar. 11. 1828, copy in NA(HF, Orig. Repts., TD, 20 Cong., 1 sess.), printed in S. Doc. 208, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 14–15, and in A. S. P., Pub. Lands, V, 482– 483; presents the opinion that the location of a township by the Asylum was invalid because the agent had failed to except the sixteenth section reserved by law for school purposes.
<pb#1081/>
It appears from the correspondence of the Reg' & Rec' of the L. O.
at Tallahassee that in the progress of their decision of the cases of preemption rights, some errors have been made by them; that some claims had been admitted on insufficient or fraudulent testimony, and that several of the claims granted had been located on lands previously located for the Deaf and Dumb Asylum of Kentucky. Under these circumstances they requested that the patents in cases of preemption might be suspended.” The papers were returned to them from this office with instructions to revise their decisions & report those cases in which they were of opinion that the patents ought to be suspended and the reasons for such suspensions *—that report is marked N° 1.
& contains upwards of 40 cases on which the patents are now suspended.” These cases may be divided into the following Classes.
1st Class. Embraces eleven cases suspended on the ground of fraud or insufficiency of evidence to establish the right of preemption on the part of the Claimant. This Class of cases depend entirely on facts of which under the law, the Reg & Rec" are the proper Judges.
I should therefore recommend that they be instructed to reexamine
& decide on the facts, after giving due notice by advertizement, to the party claiming the preemption and to the party disputing the right of the time when they will take it up & decide on the cases respectively & that so far as it respects the Gov" this decision should be final
2* Class. Embrace Eight cases suspended on the ground that the claims originated upon lands without the limits of the location for the Kentucky Asylum, and subsequently to Said location the claimants made their entries within the same and one case where the location was removed a distance of about 15 miles from one part of the public lands to another. All these cases it is believed arise under the provisions of the 3 Sect of the Act giving the right of preemption,”
where two or more persons had Settled on the same quarter Section
& were authorized to purchase one or more quarter Sections as the case might be, & they have been removed from three fourths to fifteen miles from the place of original Settlement.
So far as it respects the U.S. these are cases on which a revision of the decision of the Reg & Rec" should not be required. Altho'
under a fair construction of the Act those officers had a discretionary power to limit the locations made under the [the 3° Sect. of the
* Copy of this letter Sent to Reg' at Tallahassee Aug. 1, 1828 [Marginal notation on the MS.]
* See ante, p. 697.

<pb#1082/>
Act to a reasonable distance from the tract originally settled, yet after they had exercised that discretion with all the facts before them, which they can now have, I should not think that the U. S.
could with propriety require that a revision of those decisions should be had.—Eight of these cases are however located by the Deaf &
Dumb Asylum on the ground that the original settlement was without the limits, and that the relocation was made within the limits of their locations after they had been approved by the Secº of the Treasury Altho' by a fair construction of the law the Register &
Receiver might have exercised a discretionary power in limiting the relocations under the] * provisions of the 3* Section of this law, yet there is no express provision giving a preemptive right to any particular quarter Section under the 3* Section as there is under the
2* Section of the Act, which does give a preemptive right to any of the adjoining 4 Sections. I therefore Consider these relocations as having been made on lands previously appropriated and rightfully claimed by other persons under the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury, and therefore void. In the ordinary cases of this kind which occur at this office, patents are issued to the first purchaser and the money refunded to the last purchaser.
3° Class. Embraced three cases suspended upon the ground that the claims originated north of the Alabama line. The line run by Ellicot as the line of demarkation between the U S and Spain, has always been deemed the Southern boundary of Alabama. In surveying the lands in Alabama the Surveys did not in many cases abut on this line, and Col. Butler the Surveyor for Florida, was instructed to connect his Surveys with those that had been made in Alabama,"
Such parts of those Surveys however which lie north of Ellicott's line are within the State of Alabama, and the sale of such lands within them as may have been sold at Tallahassee require to be legalized by an act of Congress.
4th Class. Embraces eighteen cases suspended under writs of mandamus, the lands having been located in eights of different Sections and quarter Sections, and not as the law required in quarter Sections.
5th Class—embraces three cases suspended under writs of mandamus allowing three quarter Sections to two persons who had settled on the same quarter section, contrary to the provisions of the 3* Sect.
of this Act.—
In relation to these two classes of claims, see the papers & correspondence relating to the decisions of Judge Woodward marked N° 2
& No 3.−

The fair construction of the 3° Section of this Act, taken in connection with its general provisions, and without reference to the proviso, would be, that where two persons had settled on the same quarter or fractional quarter Section, they would be entitled to purchase one other quarter Section; that where three persons had settled on the same quarter or fractional quarter Section they would be entitled to purchase two other quarter sections and so on, because any other construction would give the right of purchasing any number of quarter sections; the term “more” being unlimited. But the proviso to this Section would seem to make this construction incontrovertible. The portion of the fractional quarter Section was given in addition to one entire quarter, because it might occur that several persons had settled on a fractional Quarter Section that did not perhaps contain 20 acres of Land.
In relation to these two classes of claims, I would therefore recommend that the writ of error be prosecuted, and that a decision as to the two points be had at the next Court if possible, in which decision the Gov" would acquiesce.—
6th Class.-embraces one case suspended on the ground that the Claimant is a free negro. I know of no law of the U States which prohibits a free negro from purchasing lands, unless there be some express law of the Territory by which they are excluded from purchasing, I perceive no reason why a patent should not issue.—

It appears from your letter, that you anticipated greater progress in the Survey of the private claims in West Florida, Co" Exum”
and Major Clements * have recently completed their returns to this Office, and Mr Donelson * is here making out his returns “ The sickness that prevailed last fall, and the delay occasioned by the claimants not shewing their lands, the difficulties in other respects, the badness of the Country and impassable swamps, must be the apology for delay—I had anticipated forwarding some part of this work by this mail, but find it impossible, owing to the private claims running into different Townships, which renders the comparison of them necessary before they are forwarded—as Soon as I can Complete Some that are disconnected with others you Shall have them—

<pb#1085/>
Many difficulties arise in these Surveys such as the impracticability of closing many private claims from marshes & quagmires impassable, numbers have never been Surveyed, other than beginnings established, or calls depending upon each other, the amount of land Seldom corresponds with the grants when run to the calls thereof, and many claim interfere with each other—Some of the claims have So indefinite beginnings that to identify them would be impossible, others Can Never be surveyed owing to the location being impracticable.
At the close of the Quarter ending 31* ins' there will appear a deficit on account of public Lands Surveyed, of about $1,300, and a Sum Sufficient on hand for the completion as I believe of all the private claims in West Florida, that can be Surveyed or found and to which object the attention of a Surveyor will be directed in next month.

The Committee on Roads and Canals, to which was referred a resolution of the House of Representatives, of the 22° of February, 1828,” accompanied by an act of the Territorial Government of Florida, entitled “An Act to incorporate a company, to be called the Chipola Canal Company, with powers to construct a Canal or railway between the chipola river and the eastern arm of the Bay of Sº Andrews,” report:
That, after an examination of the proposed route of the Chipola Canal, and of the charter granted by the Governor and Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida to certain persons named therein, under the style of the “Chipola Canal Company” the Committee are of opinion that the approbation of Congress to the said act should be given only upon a compliance, by the Governor and Legislative Council aforesaid, and the said Company, with the following conditions, to be made part of the Said Charter:
That the route of the contemplated canal Shall be determined, by a competent Engineer, with reference to the general line and plan of were to be elected by the people. Section 2 provided for the election of colonels, lieutenant colonels, and majors of the militia regiments.

<docbody>SIR I had the honour of addressing you on the [blank] of February last" on the subject of 121 African negroes then in my custody at Key West; I have since removed them to this place for greater safety;
while they were at Key West, attempts were made to take them from the possession of my deputy by force and by bribery; and the night before I removed them from the Island, an attempt was made to carry off a part of them; Cap: Doane of the Revenue Cutter Marion assisted me with one of his officers, and part of his crew, to protect the Africans; and on a requisition from Col" Pinkney and myself, convoyed the vessel in which I transported the negroes, from Key West to this place: I deemed it absolutely necessary to remove the negroes from Key West; they were not safe there, but the removal was attended with considerable expense: They were placed in my custody perfectly naked, many of them sick and extremely weak and feeble;
it was necessary to clothe them, and humanity required that medical aid should be furnished the sick: I have used the greatest economy in the disbursements, and for their removal, clothing, medical attendance and rations, have paid upwards of Three thousand dollars:
I am not in a situation to lay out of so large a sum without serious inconvenience, and as it is almost impossible to raise money in Florida, I hope you will take this case into consideration, and advance to me Four thousand dollars: Should this case come within the acts of

I presume there will be no objection to the advance; and should it not be a case of that discription, and the sum solicited can be advanced, it shall be accounted for in my future accounts with the Treasury:
I have given Bonds to the United States for 20.000 Dollars and for
10.000 Dollars with ample security, conditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties of my office, and truly to account for all money that may be received by me: The government will therefore hazard nothing by making the advance, and it will be a very great accomodation to me.
Should any instructions from your department, or that of the Navy be deemed necessary, I shall be pleased to receive them.”

<place-time>Head Qrs. Western Dept. CINCINNATI, O. April 5, 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR: On my return hither from my late tour of inspection, I find a copy of a letter from the Governor of Florida to the Secretary of War, dated the 28th January last,” which was referred to me on the 31st of the same month by direction from the late general-in-chief, Signed by his aide-de-camp, lieutenant Vinton.*
The Governor of Florida requests “that one company of regular troops may be stationed at, or near the head of the Sº Mark's river”, “near the centre of population”, “as a nucleus for the militia” in reference to the blacks of that vicinity—it being “known that many of the slaves taken to Florida are the very worst in the Union.”
On this reference to me, I have the honour to report to the War Department:-That, by recent orders, four companies will soon be

withdrawn from Florida, to the vicinity of New Orleans*—leaving an insufficient number for the establishment of a new post; that the distribution of regiments, into detachments of less than several companies, greatly augments the expense of their maintenance & is highly injurious to their efficiency, &, finally, that I am not aware that we have ever established a military post solely on the grounds of the Governor's application.
I am also required to report on the proposition, submitted by the same authorities, of sending two companies to garrison Thompson's Island (Key West) in reference to the growing importance, & the defenceless state of the U. States' revenue at that place.
I have already stated that, four of the companies, now in that part of Florida within this department, will soon be withdrawn, & have also suggested the impolicy of a too minute distribution of those which will remain. I beg leave to add, that the known unhealthiness of the Island would render me extremely reluctant to send to it a permanent garrison, except, in a case of high necessity; that, to my knowledge, the United States' naval commander on the West-India station is in the habit of sending vessels there for the protection of our commerce & revenue, & that, for the same purposes, the Island was, very recently, the centre of the cruising limits of the Revenue Cutter, The Florida.
For the foregoing reasons I should, without special instructions, deem it inexpedient to establish, at this time, a new military post either near the head of Sº Mark's river, or at Thompson's Island.
Whilst on the distribution of the troops in that part of Florida which is within this department, I will request you to call the attention of the Secretary to paragraph, 2, of my orders of the 3rd instant—a copy of which has been already forwarded to your office. It will be seen that in the excution of the orders from general head-quarters, therein referred to, I deemed it expedient to break up the the post, Camp King, occupied by a single company. This was done under the general authority to send four companies of the 4th Infantry from Florida to the vicinity of New Orleans, without specification of the posts from which they should be taken;–from the considerations suggested above, & from the conviction that the importance of the post was by no means commensurate with the extra expense of sending to it supplies, over land, from Tampa Bay, 120 miles.—The commanding officer at Cantonment Brooke will be instructed, should he deem it necessary to the protection of the Indian Agent & his au-

<docbody>BRIG GEN' JOS. M. HERNANDEZ Florida Militia SIR, On receipt of your letter of the 12* ult” ” I applied to the War Department for the information you mention having communicated respecting the service stated in the Muster Roll enclosed to me to have been rendered from the 21* June to the 11" July 1825. The Chief Clerk informs me that no such information is to be found on the files of the Department. I cannot therefore inform you, whether the Secretary of War will consider that service such as to entitle the persons mustered, to the compensation provided by Congress for the Florida Militia.
The claims for services under Gov" Duvalls order will be allowed on furnishing his order to you for the detail, or showing that they were performed in obedience to his requisition.*

<docbody>W. H. HUNT, P. M. Pensacola, Flor. Ter, Your letter of the 10” ult” ” has been duly considered. Of your disposition to observe the law, I am satisfied. The Section which provides that “No Post Master, or Ass" P. M., Shall act as agent for lottery offices, or under any color of purchase or otherwise, vend lottery Tickets,” effectually cuts off the distinction which you make betwixt W. H. Hunt Lottery Agent, and W. H. Hunt P. M. The same person cannot act in both capacities, because the law renders the office of the one incompatible with the business of the other.
The intention of the law is rightly apprehended by you; but as Congress determined to Secure that intention by Suffering no P. M. nor Ass' to hold the Situation except on the condition that he would be entirely disengaged from lottery business, their law cannot be evaded.
There must be no connection whatever betwixt a P. M., or a person employed in his office, and a Wender of lottery Tickets.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter under date 27" ultimo” in answer to my letters of the 11” ultimo.”
The instructions furnished will enable me I hope to make my returns Satisfactorily.
The returns of Mº Donelson" will not be completed in time this evening to check them with his account, and I am therefore induced to Postpone the forwarding of my Quarterly account until the Succeeding mail. From information obtained of the Country South and East, I am induced to believe that the Sum of Six thousand dollars will be ample for all the purposes required in my Office until I can take up the Surveying East of the Suwannee river, and have therefore to request that you will not have the residue forwarded, as I have no wish to have a control over more of the public funds than my duties require from time to time.
Enclosed you will receive a copy of the Survey of Forbes claim"
furnished me in 1824, by M" Carnachan,” upon which I founded the Connection of the Public Surveys.
In the progress of my examination of the private claims which have been Surveyed I find the absence of the report of the Register and Receiver of claims which appears to have received the Sanction of Congress in the 5* Section of an act approved 22nd April 1826.”
I have written to Mº Cairo " for a copy, but fearful he may not be in possession of it, will be obliged to you to direct a copy to be Sent to this Office, Several township plats otherwise ready to be forwarded to your Office must be withheld on that account.”

<dochead>THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY TO THE PRESIDENT</dochead>
<source>[NA:ND, SN Executive Letter Book, No. 1]</source>
<place-time>NAVY DEPARTMENT 16th April 1828</place-time>
<docbody>THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
SIR. The 3" Section of the “act for the gradual improvement of the Navy of the United States”, authorises the President, “to take proper measures to preserve the live oak timbers growing on the lands of the United States,” and “to reserve from sale such lands, belonging to the United States, as may be found to contain live oak or other timber in sufficient quantity to render the same valuable for Naval purposes”.”—
The 3* Section of the “Act making appropriations for the support of the Navy for the year 1828”, appropriates Ten thousand dollars for the purchase of such lands as the President of the United States may think necessary and proper, to provide live oak and other timber for the use of the Navy, to be paid out of the money appropriated for the gradual improvement of the Navy.”—
Under these provisions a purchase has been made of all the private claims upon the neck or isthmus of land between Santa Rosa Sound and Pensacola Bay.-A purchase has also been made of a part, and Contracts are now making for the remainder of the Claims upon the tract lying between the Navy Yard at Pensacola on the East, Perdido River and Bay on the West, Big and Rill Bayou on the North, and the Gulf of Mexico upon the South.-When these latter contracts shall have been completed, the United States will own the whole of these two tracts of land.”—
* Approved Mar. 3, 1827, 4 STAT. 242.
* Approved Mar. 19, 1828, 4 STAT. 256.
* Land for the live oak plantation was acquired by deeds of Mar. 10, 1828, from Joseph M. White and Henry M. Brackenridge, through his attorney in fact, Joseph M. White. The deeds are printed in A. S. P., Naval Affairs, III, 932, 941. The original deeds together with maps, tracings, and descriptions of the land are in the Real Estate Division, Bureau of Yards and Docks, Navy Department. Correspondence and articles of agreement relative to the purchase of the land from the files of the Secretary of the Navy are printed ibid., 
<pb#1103/>
Examinations have been carefully made under the direction of the Navy Department into the situation of both these tracts and I have to report, that, on both, there are large quantities of valuable live oak, and other timber, useful for Naval purposes, and that they are both admirably fitted, by their location and other circumstances, for the planting and Cultivation of live oak, and that by a prudent use of it, forests of that timber may there be created which will be incalculably important in the future progress of the Navy.—
I have also consulted the Commissioner of the General Land Office, who informs me that it is not important to the public interest that these tracts should be offered for sale.”—
I have therefore respectfully to request, that directions may be given to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, to reserve both from sale, and that they may be placed under the exclusive control of this Department, with a view that the timber upon them may be preserved and nursed, and live oak planted upon such portions where it is not now growing, as are fitted for it.”—
The reservations desired are:-
1* All that tract of land lying between Pensacola Bay and Santa Rosa Sound, and extending East wardly to a line drawn from the head of East River (which falls into Pensacola Bay at East River Bay) due South until it strikes Santa Rosa Sound.-
2" All that tract of land lying between the Navy Yard, Perdido Bay and River, the Gulf of Mexico, and Grand or Big Bayou, and a line 
<pb#1104/>
drawn from its head or western water to the head or Eastern Water of Rill Bayou.-

<place-time>WASHINGTON 16 April 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>To THE HON. JAMES BARBOUR, Secretary of War, SIR, I have just received information, that an order has been issued by Major General Scott, for the Evacuation of Camp King, near the Indian Agency in Florida, and directing the Company of the 4*
Infantry, now stationed there, to join the Garrison at Tampa.”
I am aware, Sir, that the Indians within the Territory of Florida, at present are quiet, and have recently given no indications of an unfriendly disposition; but the removal of these troops—the abandonment of Camp King, will leave them without check; and will expose an extensive planting district in East Florida, and the Whole population of the Alachua Country, now for the first time, after a succession of embarrassments and misfortunes, exhibiting a State of decided and growing prosperity, to all the apprehensions and hazards of an unprotected frontier, bordered by Savages.
At Camp King, these troops are posted between the Indians and White Settlements; and under the circumstances, interpose a sufficient security: remove them to Tampa bay, and they are more than a hundred miles in advance, leaving the whole Indian Nation in their rear—and the white population, their cattle, Slaves and plantations unguarded, and open to every variety of Indian assault and depredation.
At best the removal of these troops, will lessen emigration, and retard the Settlement and prosperity of this valuable part of the Territory.
Viewing the subject as I do, I should forego the performance of a duty, and hazard the interests of my constituents, expecially in that part of Florida to which this communication has reference, did I not zealously urge on your consideration, the importance and necessity of countermanding the order for removal, and continuing the Garrison at Camp King, for the present, and till the accumulating population and increased strength of the Country, shall be equal to its own protection.
” See ante, p. 1060, n.
<pb#1105/>
If the demands of the service generally, have made it necessary to withdraw any part of the Military force from Florida, so that three companies only, can remain for Camp King and for Tampa bay,+I
beg leave to state, from my local Knowledge of the district, that these companies divided, and one remaining at Camp King, will afford a much more effectual and satisfactory protection, than would the three concentrated at Tampa.
I have the honor to be [MS. illegible.]
