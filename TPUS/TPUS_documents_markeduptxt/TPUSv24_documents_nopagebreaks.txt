<docbody>SIR, The repeated complaints I have received in relation to Fugitive slaves, within the limits of the Florida Indians,” & the difficulties necessarily arising in relation to the rights of individuals make it necessary that some certain mode should be adopted for the more speedy & satisfactory decission of these questions.
I respectfully suggest that instructions may be issued to the agent to refer all these questions to the Judge of the District & that the Judge be requested to decide & report the cases to the Department so that an order may be issued on the basis of a Judicial decision"—
This course under such regulations as may be devised by the wisdom of the Department will greatly promote the harmony of that part of the country & save the Department itself a number of vexatious &

M. at “Wanton's which can be subjected to investigation, or whether the representation is founded on the notorious character of the P. M. which deprives him of confidence in his station. If M Newcomb will furnish more specific information, of either kind, an investigation can be instituted (without reference to his name, unless required by extraordinary circumstances not to be anticipated.)
The Postmaster General has authorized the establishment of a private P. O. at the “Seminole Agency,”—the proceeds of postage being allowed for the transportation of the mail from the nearest P. O.—on account of its distance from the mail route."

The charge of postage on proposals for publications, like that which you have enclosed to me, is the Same as on letters. They are neither newspapers nor pamphlets, the only articles on which the law makes abatement from letter postage. The distance from Claiborne is more than 80 miles; therefore the postage is 12% cents for a single letter;
and three bills, besides the paper which covers them, makes a quadruple letter, amounting to 50 cents postage.”

SIR, I had the honor, to receive your letter of the 7" Inst,” together with a letter from the Commissioner of the General Land Office,” and one from M* Allen, the Agent of the Kentucky Deaf and Dumb Asylum,” in relation to the reservation of a tract of land in the County of Gadsden, made in favor of Neamathla, an Indian chief;
The Chief has never complied with any of the provisions of this reservation, and absolutely refused to reside on it. Neamathla left Florida, in January 1825, and returned to the Creek Nation, of which he was a native and is now Chief of a Town, in that Nation. In my opinion, it would be inexpedient, longer to reserve this Tract of Land, for the purposes designated by the Treaty, with the Florida Indians.
Neamathla has repeatedly assured me, that he never would reside on the Land.

<docbody>SIR.—The Captains of Wessels who have told you that I do not require them to deposite their letters in my Office," have knowingly told a thing they know to be false, and have attempted to impose upon you. When Captains of vessels call to deliver their letters, I

SIR. I enclose the copy of an act Supplementary to the Several acts providing for the Settlement & confirmation of private land

claims in Florida,” and also a copy of the Report of the Register &
Rec' of the Land Office at St Augustine acting as Commissioners,"
& referred to in the 2* Section of the Act.
You will perceive that the 1st Section of this act confirms specifically three claims in West Florida, and such claims in East Florida as have been recommended for confirmation by the Commissioners or by the Register & Receiver acting as Commissioners on the conditions and to the extent particularly stated in the Act.
These claims correspond very nearly, if not precisely, with those referred to in the 12th Section of the Act approved the 8th of Feb”
1827." and it is therefore necessary that under the provisions of that Section they be accurately laid down on the Township plats returned to the Land Offices and to this Office.
If the three claims in West Florida confirmed by this Act have not been laid down on your plats, you will cause them to be so laid down as Soon as practicable. I understand that the claimant of No 10.
is disposed to avail himself of the conditions of the Act.
The 4th Section of the Act having prolonged the time for the adjudicating on the private land claims in East Florida, I am apprehensive that a further delay of the public Surveys will be unavoidable.
If however on advising with & obtaining the necessary information from the Register & Rec" at St Augustine, you may be of opinion that you can with propriety extend your surveys in East Florida, you will proceed to do so as early as practicable in the ensuing Autumn.
The 6th Section of the Act provides for a judicial decision of all the claims under the Treaty with Spain, not settled by the provisions of this Act and which have not been reported as antidated or otherwise fraudulent, and which contain a greater quantity of land than the Commissioners were authorized to decide, as it would be unadvisable for the Government to proceed to the sale of the land that may be thus claimed, it will be necessary for you to lay down on the township plats the claims of this discription, So far as it can be done from the information filed with the Commissioners, or that obtained from other Sources, with the view of withholding the lands from Sale until there be a judicial decision, or the claimants shall have failed to avail themselves of the provisions of this Act.
With great respect &c G. G.

<docbody>SIR A post office having been established lately, at the Seminole Indian Agency, it is the nearest point to Canto: Brooke, and to which, all letters intended for that post, should be addressed, and should be so noted, on, the Register.
In writing to you, relative to the recruiting service the other day, I ought; to have said, that it is not my wish, to go on the recruiting service, this year, in any event, but, should wish very much to be detailed, next spring, or fall, for the New York Station, as M” Brooke and her family, will remain at the north, until, that period.
Whilst writing, it becomes my duty, to to mention, a circumstance, very injurious to the public service, both in a military point of view, & the value of the public lands, in the neighborhood of Tampa Bay.
Several persons, have settled near Canto: Brooke, who are in the habit of selling whiskey, to the soldiers & Indians, and cutting wood.
It is out of my power to prevent it, there being no court, nearer, than St Augustine, and to exercise force, would subject myself, & the army, to the abuse of every newspaper, in the Union, and perhaps, induce the Secretary at War, to suppose, that, an improper exercise of authority, had been used. I wish therefore that, I could be empowered, by the proper Dept, to remove such of those persons, who are, in the habit, of committing the offences, complained of. An early attention to this, matter, would be beneficial, to the U. States."

<docbody>SIR, I had a conversation yesterday with the Atto General, & he concurs in opinion with me about the two sections of the Act of which we were conversing"—I called at your office to see your instructions *—found that you had not directed the Register & Receiver, to authorize the selection of a smaller for a larger quantity, to wit, 19
arpans for 640 which the claimant of No 10 is anxious to do—both are within the plats and the grants, the major may include the minor, but if a claimant will take less than is offered him it will be within the spirit of the law. I take leave also most respectfully to suggest that the claimants cannot select, to be limited by “sectional lines”
until the land is laid off in sections—It seems to me that the law cannot be executed until all the claims, the owners of which, accept the conditions of the act, are surveyed—I will also respectfully suggest that in the Commissioners reports of West Florida numbered from one to thirty," the act of Congress for confirming that report confirmed all the Spanish conflicting claims to the exclusion of the

British," & among them was one of Francisco Bonal for an Island in the Escambia river of 7000 arpans,” that I learn has not been surveyed although confirmed—in the first act, & it may be that the thirty are in the same condition— Some instructions may be necessary on that point—I would also take it as a favor if orders were given, to the surveyor general to have all the claims confirmed, surveyed as directed in the Act of Congress—I understand that the Deputy informed Col Searcy the draftsman, that an Island owned by me, had increased lately, & the same Deputy wrote to my agent that he did not survey it because he had no one to shew it to him—It seems that he could not find it, and yet knew it had increased in size—
This Island was granted as an Island “Pocomas, O menus” more or less and has not increased—It never was surveyed but a plat made which has been furnished, & was granted to a Spanish officer for his public services as Containing 800 arpans more or less—It probably contains double the quantity, & did when it was granted—It is difficult to be surveyed, but that is no reason for its postponement—When the law directs a public officer to do an act, & he is also instructed to by the Head of his Department, & fails, I know the the legal remedy, but I have no desire to resort to it, if the surveyor or his Deputies do not neglect it intentionally—I have as yet no other reason than the fact above to suppose that the excuse of the Deputy was a good one, & request that he be again instructed to make the survey, & if I am informed when they are there, or my agent we will send to shew him that Island, the enlargement of which only he has discovered.
I shall be in New York until August if you should have occasion to address me—
I will take it as a favor to be informed as soon as the returns of the private surveys arrive."

<docbody>THE PRESIDENT.
SIR, The Act passed on the 23" of May last " entitled—“an Act supplementary to the several acts providing for the settlement and confirmation of private Land claims in Florida” having authorized the claimants to Lands not confirmed to file petitions in the District Courts of Florida for the adjudication of their claims “according to the forms, rules, regulations, conditions, restrictions and limitations prescribed to the District Judges and claimants in the State of Missouri and Territory of Arkansas to institute proceedings to try the validity of their claims”—and as claims to the value of several millions of dollars will thus be brought before the District Courts of Florida for decision, it behooves the United States, therefore, to take all due measures for the thorough investigation of these claims, and to take care that all the Laws and regulations of the Spanish Government relative to the disposition of the public domains in the several colonies be fully presented to the Court. To do this it will be essentially necessary to have a person employed who is well acquainted with the Spanish language, and who has made an opportunity of becoming conversant with the Laws of Spain relative to the disposition of Lands in the Colonies.
Mr White, the present delegate from Florida having been one of the Commissioners for deciding on the private claims in West Florida, the report made by which commission is one of the best and most satisfactory that has at any time been made on the subject of Spanish and British claims, and having acquired a competent knowledge of the Spanish language, and made himself well acquainted with the Laws of Spain in relation to the disposition of her Lands, I take the liberty of suggesting the expediency of employing him as assistant Counsel under the provision of the 11" Section of the Act above referred to—
Should Mr White be thus employed, and should the Attorney Gen.'
deem it expedient to have the aid of a person conversant with the language and Laws of Spain in preparing the cases on which appeals have been taken from Missouri and Arkansaw there would appear to be a peculiar propriety in employing Mr White to aid the Attorney Gen' in preparing these cases as the decision on many of the cases in Florida will essentially depend on the principles which may be established by

the Supreme Court in deciding the cases brought up from Missouri and Arkansas.

SIR, I have in a conversation with the President expressed an opinion of the necessity and propriety of employing some person well acquainted not only with the Spanish language but with the Spanish laws relative to the disposition of the public domain in the Spanish colonies as assistant Counsel under the provisions of the 11" Section of the Act passed the 23" of May last, and at the same time suggested your name as a person well acquainted both with the Spanish language and laws, and regulations relative to the disposition of the public domain. The President acquiesced in the propriety of employing such assistant counsel, and expressed his opinion in favor of employing you, provided there was no objection arising out of your situation as a delegate, and he was not aware that there were any such, and provided also an arrangement could be made with you as to the compensation.”
He seemed also to think that it would be advisable to extend your employment to the aid of Mr Wirt in preparing the cases from Missouri for trial at the next term of the Supreme Court. On this latter subject I will see Mr Wirt and ascertain his views. I think however that you had better address a letter to me stating the terms on which you would act as assistant counsel, and those for which you would undertake to aid Mr Wirt in the Missouri cases to be tried at the next term of the Supreme Court.

<docbody>SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 18" Inst, in which you inform me that it is your wish, and that of the President, * Published contemporaneously in the Tallahassee, Fla. Advocate, Apr. 4, 1829.

that I should be engaged in the defence of the suits now depending, &
those which may be instituted, against the United States—
I have devoted three or four years to the subject of the organization of the Spanish Tribunals, the powers of the Provincial officers, & the history, changes, & modifications of the local ordinances of the Spanish Government, in relation to the disposition of the Royal domaine—In addition to this, I have procured several collections of Spanish law, and numerous copies, of written orders Commissions, &
official letters, prescribing the duties, & limiting the authority of the local officers, at my own expence, and at great trouble—When I
filled was in the office of Commissioner, I remained in the country three years in the laborious discharge of its duties, & exposed my self to the resentment, persecution, & indeed hazards of assasination
(which was once attempted). of those who had claims which we were compelled to reject—Our report was approved with a commendation never bestowed on any other by Congress”—of All the Boards of Commissioners that were ever organized before, there was no report against British grants within the former Province of West Florida, &
valuable lands in Louisiana, Missisippi, & Alabama have been confirmed to the amount of more than two millions of acres—Since our Report Congress have not confirmed any more, either in those states or in Florida—It may confidently be asserted that our report on that class of claims has saved more than one million of acres to the goverement, of the most valuable lands—I mention this to shew that the U States have no claim upon me without paying me an adequate &
liberal consideration & that I have by the opinions I have pronounced deprived my self of the opportunity of appearing as Counsel in numerous cases. As soon as our office was closed and before our reports were published, The British claimants offered to employ me in all their cases, & two percent on the amount would have been a handsome fortune. You state that the President wishes to know what Compensation I will ask. This must of course depend on the number and nature of the cases, in which I may be retained—There is now in the supreme court a case from Mississippi involving a question of the validity of a British grant which may incidentaly affect the U States to the amount of more than a million of acres, although the contest is between two individuals. The principle to be settled is a most important one.
I am willing to appear and argue, or assist in prepareing arguments against the British claim, or claims for $500—There is a question also involving all the grants in the country between the Mississippi &
Perdido made by the Spanish authorities subsequent to the time at

which we claim that it was ceded. I was applied to to appear against the pretentions of the U States, with M Webster, but they did not pay the fee, the case was not called, & I would prefer to appear for the U. States. for this I would require $500—This is also a contest between individuals, but the decission will affect the U Stats by settling a class of claims of more than a million and a half of acres.
The claims of Missouri and Arkansas now depending, or which may be brought to the Supreme Court refer to the same questions that were before our Board, & if the President supposes that my aid would promote the public interests, I am willing to assist the Atto General for $500 in the principal case, & one or two hundred in each of the other cases that are now depending or which may be brought to the supreme Court—I am not yet employed in a singgle case in Florida, & am willing to be engaged to oppose such claims as were reported against by us, and to indicate by law, & documents in my possession, the opinions I delivered in my official character—Propositions have been made to me by the claimants in two cases which if complied with, I shall act as assistant counsel for them—The principle on which they must be decided is different from any other, & will not conflict with any doctrine laid down in the Reports—The one is a grant of indemnity for losses, the other a question purely of national law. I would not be willing to engage to argue against all the claims in Florida, but to assist the District atto in such as I consider illegal
& vicious—In these I would appear on the same terms as the Missouri cases—As my duties at Washington would require me to be sometimes absent I would only engage to superintend the pleadings, &
direct the manner of proceding to present the points on which the supreme Court could give a proper opinion—In the settlement of a few leading principles, to be extracted from the most obscure system of jurispudence to be found in the history of any Country, in a foreign language, & in many instances depending on Commissions, &
official letters never printed a quantity of not less than six millions of acres of land depend. The sums which I have charged would not be one fourth of a per cent upon the amount, & not one per cent on what will actually be saved to the governent if the questions are fairly presented—I am not willing to appear in any, unless I am retained in all of those mentioned above, & particularly in the British grants
& those of Missouri & Arkansas—As to the Florida cases I should like to reserve to my self the right of appearing for such of them, as I
find have claims not conflicting with any principle which may come up in the others; & such as are of undoubted validity. I shall be pleased to be informed of the views of the President as to the Compensation, within a few days, as my future course will be governed

by it, and as to more specifick arrangements, they can be made when I return to Washington on my way to Florida in August.

Congress having extended the period for adjudicating private claims east, I am pursuaded that endless difficulties will accrue in prosecuting the Surveys in that quarter at the present time, I will however Communicate with the Register & Receiver at your request, and apprise you of what I may Ultimately determine upon.
My Deputy Surveyors have just arrived from the West, have been driven out of the Country by the extreme heat of the weather. The claimants have not in one Single instance availed themselves of this opportunity to have their claims run out, although notified through the paper at Pensacola; and the deputies remaining at that City four days under very heavy expences. I am apprehensive that large portions of those claims are So poor as to induce the Owners to permit their Survey and Sale with a hope of future indemnity by the United States, this opinion however is wholly my own without any information on the Subject from others.
I forwarded my Bond to Judge Randall for his Certificate a few days Since and which he returned in Consequence of a Small informality that might have impared Somewhat its Validity—A new bond has been executed and forwarded this day to Judge Randall, who will approve and enclose it to you.

It is now two years and a half since Congress postponed all the orders to pass a Special Act,” singling out this from all other objects, –It is a work in which all the states west & south of the Allegany mountains is deeply interested. In that two years and a half we have not even had the report of the first reconnoisance—There has been no new scheme, or neighbourhood project—no little tower, or fortification, no new Pier or Breakwater, to which the attention of the Engineers

has not been directed to the exclusion of this work. If the map is not engraved, & the Report printed, before the meeting of Congress one year more will be lost. It has not been my habit to complain, or to encourage an idea that the South is neglected—I have never believed that such was the intention of any part of the govement—I feel exceedingly anxious to have that report presented—The reports which have been unofficially made has caused the subject gradually to fade from the public mind—You will perceive from the paper I enclose that here a considerable interest is yet manifested, & complaints uttered for the delay—The extract from my letter however proves that I have given several reasons for the delay—The fund of $20,000 cannot be expended unless it has been diverted to other objects, & if so, it is but reasonable to claim that the map & Report be engraved & printed out of the other appropriation before the next session of Congress.

25th, and that of the 7th " on the 29th. I have also received one from Judge Webb, dated Webbville the 1* ins' at which time my Commission had not reached him. He intends to embark at this Port for Key West.
When he gets here, I Will enter into the Necessary Bonds, and take the Oath of Office, of which you Shall be notified. So Soon as I arrive at Key West, I will Commence taking the Census,” agreeably to your instructions, and forward them on in time for the Meeting of the Senate.
Permit me Sir, to request the favor of you to have forwarded on to Key West, as Soon as may be Convenient, a Sett of the Laws of the United States, as those that were in my office, have been delivered over to Adam Gordon Esq" the present Marshal. It Will be of the highest importance to have them, as I presume Nothing of the Kind Can be found on the Island. It has been Suggested to me, that the most Convenient and expeditious plan Would be to Send them to the Havana, to the Care of the American Consul, who Will have almost daily opportunities to forward them to me at Key West.
There is another Subject to which I beg leave to Call your attention.
I am informed that it is the intention of the Navy Department to Sell all the Public Property at Key West. Would it not be better to reserve one of the Buidlings for a Court House. I am told that the Hospital is the best Calculated for that purpose. I do myself the Honor to Write by this Mail to the Secretary of the Treasury giving him also my Views on the Subject. If you can make this arrangement, I think it will be a great Saving to the Government, and Convenience to the Court, as Houses must be Scarce and Very expensive.”
Please accept for your self my grateful acknowledgements, for this further Proof of your friendly patronage, and assure the President of my everlasting gratitutde, and best Wishes for the Health and happiness of you both.—
I have the Honor to be, With the highest Consideration your most obedient and Very obliged humble Servant, HENRY WILSON

The accompanying documents N° 1.2 & 3 will apprise you of the Steps taken to have the private claims Surveyed, and under your letter of instructions of date the 18" August 1827,” I feel justified in Saying that all has been done by this department that Can be required of it—If the Surveys which have been executed are to remain open for additional Surveys they Cannot be Completed until the ensuing year, and will tend to accumulate difficulty on difficulty in this Office. On this Subject I must await your instructions—enclosed you will find my answer to M.” White, Subject to your perusal, and I must ask the favour to have it Sealed, and forwarded to his address—I would barely remark that the Deputy Surveyor alluded to by Col° White was in his Company at Pensacola, on Several occasions during his Stay there under my instructions, and that Col." White gave him as a reason for not going with him to Shew his lands, the delicate health of his Lady, yet why did not the Col" Send Some person or why did his Agent Subsequently fail to attend to Col° Whites business.
I trust Sir, that you will have no other than a just regard for the fulfilment of the laws in this matter, and that my Deputy Surveyor and myself will not be held Subject to the will of any person who may choose to Call for Surveys when their liesure and inclination prompts them.

D SIR, In compliance with your instructions bearding date, June
1827 directing me to the West, for the purpose of taking up the Surveys of the Private Claims East of the Escambia river and north of the basis Parallel, together with the public Land &C.

You also instructed me to be and attend in the Town of Pensacola, from the 5"Until the 10" of August, for the purpose of receiving from the different claimants Such information as might be necessary to enable me to find the diferent tracts of land &C Sir, in Compliance of which I arrived at the Town of Pensacola either on the 3rd or 4" of August, and remained there until the 12" or 13" of Said month, without being able to obtain but little information of advantage to me, from the claimants, Some of them appeared to be willing to afford any information, others were indifferent, and Some were not to be Seen.
I proceeded to the woods on the east Side of the Escambia Bay, near the head of the Same, above the basis parallel, and Commenced work about the 27 or 28" of August, my Young Men with me were taken Sick, in Consequence of which together with the death of my Son, and one other young man in my employ I was under the necessity of leaving the Country for a few weeks for Steeer-ahd-fer Safety—I returned again early in November and took up my work, I went again to Pensacola, about the 22nd November for the purpose of Seeing Some of the Claimants to induce them, to Send Some person or Come themselves and Shew me their lands, Some did So, and had their lands Surveyed, others would not Come, all of which I Surveyed, that I could by any means find, and Some with the utmost difficulty—
In relation to the Island in the Escambia river, I was at no time able to procure any person to Shew me the land, Co." White told me that a Mr Williams would be with me for the purpose of Shewing me Something about it, but he failed to do so & as I was informed there are many Slues that run, through the Islands, which makes it difficult for a Stranger to make any particular designation.—There was a package of papers Sent to me, being directed to Ja" R. Donelson [o]r myself, Said to belong to Co." White, with a letter of instructions, but of no Service to me, without a pilot, the letter I believe I left with A. Gordon Esqr of Pensacola, and the other papers, sent back to the Post Office I believe, from which they Came—with much difficulty I assure you that it was that I got to Survey as many private claims as I did, I believed it to be my duty to Survey all I Could find, and was at the trouble and expence of obtaining from the Keeper of the Public Archives a list of all the Claims that he Knew any thing about, in the Section of Country I was directed to work in, but for want of the necessary information I have no doubt there are a few yet unsurveyed, but if the necessary information Can be obtained I am ready at any Convenient period to Complete the Surveys agreeable to Your instructions. &C.

<docbody>HON: PETER B. PORTER Secretary of War.
SIR, Last winter I had the honor to Submit to your predecessor my views for the removal of the Florida Indians," and found they were approved by him—but at that time no appropriation had been made for the removal of Such Indians as might be willing to emigrate to the country assigned to them west of the Mississippi-

Gov: Barbour assured me if the appropriation was made by Congress," he would do all in his power to promote the emigration of the Indians in this quarter—I was then as I now am, particularly desirous Co.' Thos. L. M*Kenny should visit the Indians in this Territory.
His knowledge of the Indian Character, habits and Manners, better qualify him for effecting the views of the Gov" in relation to these unfortunate people than any other man I have ever known; and your predecessor Said that if he could possibly dispense with his Services he should be Sent to Florida—
I am aware Sir, that M Barbour by some was censured for sending M" M*Kenney last Summer on a visit to several Indian Nations,"
but the Services he rendered to the United States, were certainly highly valuable; and when the violence of party Shall Subside the foresight of Mr Barbour & the Services of M" M*Kenny will be acknowledged by all, who understands the interest, and appreciates the honor of the country.
Beleiving that he will do much more by his presence among the Indians than he can possibly effect for the country in his office for a few months to come, I request you will (if his Services can be withdrawn from his Office) permit him to visit Florida—Nothing Short of the conviction that his influence with the Chiefs of the Indian Tribes in this Country, will be equal to effecting the objects of your Department, would induce me to make this request Convinced that the happiness and prosperity of this Territory must be greatly promoted by the removal of the Indians, and that by such removal humanity will be consulted and the remnant of these Tribes Saved from distruction.
I most respectfully and earnestly Solicit your attention and influence in the accomplishment of this interesting and important object.”

SIR, The change which has recently taken place in the Minister of War," has, it is feared delayed the execution of a plan which I had the honor to lay before the late Secretary Gov: Barbour for the removal of the Florida Indians.” I had urged to Gov: Barbour the importance of your visiting this country to effect this desirable object, and, understood from him if the appropriation passed Congress sufficient to commence giving effect to the plans of the Gov" in concentrating the Indians, he would if your services could be spared send you to Florida—I yet hope his successor will consent that you shall visit Florida, as I am convinced you would have great influence with the Chiefs of the Siminole Nation—
I have written to the Secretary of War urging that you may be sent to this quarter,” and I hope he will accede to the request—If the business of your Office should prevent your absence from the City I request I may be authorised to send a party of Indians to visit the Country designed for them, and that the Sub Agent Maj. John Phagan may have the conduct of the Party, a more careful and vigilent and valuable Officer is not to be found any where. I can depend on his decision, prudence & Integrity of character This Officer and one individual I can select to assist him, or in case of his illness or death to lead the party will be all that is necessary—
My plan is to take one respectable Indian from each Town, not permitting the whole party to exceed twenty five—That they shall be furnished each, with a horse bridle Saddle rifle two blankets & a Kettle and such necessaries as will be required—what portion of the fund appropriated for the emigrant Indians will be assigned to this Superintendency to meet the expense of the emigrating party is for the Secretary to determine. I desire to be at liberty to exercise my discression in arranging this party except in the essential article of expence—I do not confidently state that I shall succeed fully in meeting the wishes of the Gov" but I will omit nothing on my part that will give satisfaction to the emigrants or the Department.—
It may be necessary for me to visit the Indians at the Agency, and on the Appalachicola River, and to converse with the Chiefs—
Should the Dept not be able to spare you I must request if I am authorised to act in this business you will send to me such a talk as

your jugment may approve to be given to the Chiefs as from their Great father—This request is perhaps unusual but I know it will have great effect on the Indians, if they are told it is sent to them from Washington ”

<docbody>TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR. The communication of the Engineer Department of the 30"
Ultimo has been received.” I shall proceed agreeably to your instructions to make the examination of the Appalachicola River and report to the department the nature and extent of the obstructions to the navigation of said river and the effect of removing them, and shall immediately thereafter furnish an estimate of the expense, and the mode I propose to adopt for that purpose. In the mean time I now offer to the department such information as I possess, founded upon a previous cursory reconnoissance. The obstructions above alluded to consist principally in deposites of quantities of drift wood and large trees with their roots in such portions of the river as are tortuous and winding. It will be necessary to make use of flats or scows with Spanish windlasses to remove them, after they have been cut or sawed under the water. As the water in this river is low in the fall of the year, the sooner preparations for the work are commenced the better.
I will therefore immediately after the examination cause two flats between 50 & 60 feet long with Spanish windlasses to be built at or near the junction of the Flint and Chattahouchie Rivers, in order to commence operations whenever the water is low enough, and when I shall have been furnished with the requisite funds for one month’s wages and provisions of the hands to be employed for in the service and the contingencies for building the flats, and purchase of axes, chairs, cables ropes &ca &ca. It will require 20 able bodied hands, experienced axemen and boatmen for the period of three months to remove the obstructions to the navigation of the Appalachicola River as effectively as is contemplated by the Act of Congress.” The following is a rough estimate of the expense & provisions of 20 hands for one month, together with an estimate for building the flats and purchase of chains, cables, axes &ac &ac
20 hands at $1. per day for 30 days $600.00. Provisions & whiskey for same, for 30 days @ 50/100 300.00.
2 Flats @ $75 each is $150, cables, chains, windlasses axes, grindstone (all to be sold after work is completed for US) 300.00 Total for first month $1200.00
After the above examination and commencement of preparations are finished. I shall proceed to survey the river and Harbor of St

Marks and shall about the five of October next, report to the Department. I will agreeably to instructions furnish an extimate of the expense of removing the obstructions (if practicable) to the navigation in said Harbor and river. The mode also to be adopted will be proposed in the report, agreably to the directions of the Department.”

<source>[NA:GLO, PLC, Incoming Corr.:LS*]</source>
<place-time>Office of the Attorney General of the U. States No 2. July 26 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have read the correspondence between M* Graham, the Commissioner of the Gen' Land Office, and Colo. White,” relative to the employment of assistant counsel to the District Attorneys of Florida in defending the interests of the U.S. against the claimants of Spanish grants in that Territory. I collect from the correspondence that those claims are to a very great amount and that they rest in a great degree on Spanish ordinancies, decrees, orders &" many of which have never yet been published and are not to be found but by accident in private and different hands. It is manifest that the success of the United States in the Supreme Court must depend on the proper preparation of these cases in the courts below, the Supreme Court being limited on appeal to the case as it stands on the record. And it is equally manifest that these cases cannot be properly prepared in the Courts below except by Counsel who are masters of the whole law on the subject. M Whites service as a Commissioner for the settlement of these claims and the experience derived from this service, and the circumstance which he states of his possession of many of those obscure and unpublished orders, decrees, letters &" on which the power of the subordinate officers of the Spanish Crown to make the grants in question do materially depends would certainly point him out as the person who ought to be retained, if his services can be commanded, for a liberal compensation. I would advise that Colo White be generally retained as assistant Counsel to the District Attorney in Florida: that he received a liberal retaining fee and such other fee for the argument of each case as you may think reasonable;
with a special understanding that it be considered part of his duty to see that the each case is properly prepared before it be submitted to the Court for it's decision. I do not think that Colo. White, on farther reflection, will insist on being left at liberty to take cases also against the Government; and to make his own selection of the cases in which he will appear on the one side or the other; because of the extreme delicacy of such a situation and the misconstruction to which he will expose himself, let his conduct be ever so pure. Indeed I do not think that the government could with any propriety enter into

such an engagement with any gentleman, if they can find a competent assistant on whom they may rely in every case.
I beg leave to suggest that it will be very important to have a complete collection of all the Spanish & French ordinances &" affecting the land titles in Florida and the other Western territories and States formerly belonging to the Crowns of Spain and France at different times. Such a collection will be indispensible to a just decision of these claims by the Supreme Court. If Colo. White could be induced to compile such a collection, with an accurate index, it would be of inestimable value in these controversies: and the expense of printing a full edition would be well bestowed by the Government. Such a work seems to me to be most imperiously called for by all the Courts and all the Counsel who will have to act upon this interesting subject;
and the value of the subject at stake as well as the activity with which these claims will be urged against the U.S. require that no time should be lost in making the collection. Such a work would be of infinitely more value than the assistance of any counsel that could be commanded in the mere argument of the causes.
With regard to the cases which Colo White mentions as depending in the Supreme Court, between individuals, but in which the U. S.
are concerned I know nothing of these. He does not give the names, and my docket gives me no information of such cases. I cannot therefore judge of the necessity of calling in assistant Counsel to the Attorney General. I can only say in general, that it will always be agreeable to me to have assistance in the public causes in the Supreme Court whenever the Pres' shall think proper to give it: In a cause depending on the local laws of Spain in her former provinces, laws and ordinances and orders, depending, often, on mere letters and which have never been published, such assistance would be indispensable unless I could be put in possession of the laws themselves.
I have the honor to remain, Sir, with the highest respect, Your Obed" Sev"

SIR, Your letter of the 15" ult” covering one to Mr White has been received," I am not certain as to Mr. White's present direction, I have however sent the letter under cover to the Post Master at New York with directions that if he does not call for it in all this month that it be returned to this Office.
I very much regret the delays which have occurred in laying down the private claims in West Florida which you state to have arisen from the defects in describing the claims, so that the Surveyors are unable to locate & survey them from the information derived from the abstracts of decisions, & from the neglect of the claimants to come forward and give the necessary information by which they may be ascertained and surveyed.
Before the lands are subdivided for sale, I wish another effort to be made this autumn to survey all the private claims confirmed, and it would be advisable to give early & due notice in the Paper published in Pensacola, of the time that your deputies will attend there for the purpose: this notice should be accompanied with a list of all the claims, the description of which is so defective that they cannot be located and surveyed from the information derived from the public archives, and the claimants informed that if they do not attend or furnish the necessary information that the Lands will be surveyed as public land, without respect to such claims—and the lands should be

so subdivided where they are saleable, and your Township plats closed and returned.
I regret that the Surveyor did not himself examine the Island, or Islands, claimed by Mr. White so as to make a more special report as to the causes which prevented the survey of either or all of them.

SIR, I have the honor to transmit to you the Copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Navy to this Department, under date the 6" of June,” Stating that he had given instructions to the Commander of the West India Squadron,” to afford a conveyance to the Judge, Marshal, and District Attorney with their records and papers, to Key West, if it could be done without the neglect of other duties; and further, that there would be no objection to the using of any of the public buildings at Key West, after the expiration of the term, in

<docbody>TO THOMAS DOUGLASS Atty U.S. St Augustine. E. F. and JAMES G.
RINGGOLD Atty U.S. at Tallahassee F and BENJ. D. WRIGHT Att”
U. S. Pensacola.”
SIR. Information having been rec" both at the Treasury " &
Navy Dept.” that extensive depredations are committed on the public

Lands, by taking therefrom the Live Oak & other valuable Timber, I am requested by the Secy of the Treasury to call your attention to the Instructions heretofore given on this subject.”
It is beleived that a large portion of such depredations are committed
1st by persons under the cover of Contracts with the claimants of Spanish grants, dated subsequent to the period limited in the Treaty.
2nd. Under cover of contracts with the claimants of Lands whose claims have been regularly filed but not confirmed by Congress.
3rd. Under cover of contracts with claimants whose claims have been confirmed either as valid under the treaty, or as donations, but which claims are attempted to be located on Lands not covered by the original grant or donation, for the double purpose of obtaining better lands, and disposing of the valuable live oak Timber.—
It is understood that the Courts in Florida have refused to sustain actions for trespass brought by the U States against persons who affect to claim under a Spanish concession, or under a donation from the United States.
It is not beleived that this refusal of the Courts can extend to the cases coming under the 1st or 3" Classes above mentioned.
The claims of the 1st Class are declared by the Treaty to be invalid and the question which arises in relation to those of the 3" Class is not a question as to validity of title, but one of mere location to be decided on record or oral testimony as the case may be. It is therefore the wish of the Secretary of the Treasury that in cases coming under the 1 & 3" Class above referred to, where from the representations of the Agent of the Navy Dept. or from other information, you have cause to beleive that trespasses have been committed on the public Lands you will institute suit against the trespassers With respect to the 2" Class of Cases, the Courts may probably entertain doubts of the propriety of sustaining actions of trespass so far as the validity of title might be involved in the decision; but it is presumable, that on the representation of the Agent for the Navy, that the claimants in these cases were cutting down & taking off valuable live oak Timber essential for the use of the Navy, the Courts would grant injunctions to stay Waste, until the validity of title was decided, and if they should refuse to do this, it is possible that they might be induced to lay an injunction on the purchaser prohibiting the payment of the purchase money until the title to the Land was decided, this latter course if it can be effected in any way, would more probably

arrest the depredations on the public lands and the destruction of the Live oak timber than any other that could be devised.—
Should the Courts however oppose themselves to either of the modes above referred to by which the Live Oak Timber may be preserved for the Gov" you will then have recourse to the provisions of the Act of the last Session of Congress providing for the settlement & confirmation of Private Land Claims in Florida, and whenever a claimant shall avail himself of the provisions of the 6th Section of that Act,”
you will apply for an injunction to stay Waste, provided you are advised by the Agent for the Navy or through some other authentic source that the Lands afford valuable Live Oak timber, lying within five miles of Navigable water.—
A copy of this letter will be furnished the Sec of the Navy" who will give the necessary instructions to his Agent on whose information your proceedings will be principally founded.”
With great respect. Your Ob" St.

SIR. I have received your letter of the 31" Ult." with a Copy of the Report of the Att" General on the subject of the land claims in Florida—If I were to consult my individual interests I should decline any offer on the part of the U. States-Having acted, however in the Office of a Commissioner under the Florida Treaty, there are a number of claims reported by me as a constituent member of the Board in West Florida as invalid and fraudulent, that I never could advocate consistently with delicacy and propriety—I feel highly flattered by the desire the President has been pleased to express to engage me as assistant counsel, as it Evinces his confidence, and approbation of the Report made by the Commissioners—I acknowledge the force of the reasoning of the Att’ General and the propriety of the Condition annexed by the President to my employment—I have promised only to assist in the argument of two claims against the government, those of John Forbes & Co & Arredondo—The first depends on an Indian Sale and a decree of approbation by the Provincial Governor—
The other was a contract to bring settlers on a tract of land designated, within a certain time which was not done before the Treaty and transfer, and the question to be decided is how far the transfer to the U. States absolves the grantees from the performance.—These two

claims are anomalous—There are none of the same kind in Florida—
They depend on principles so entirely different from all the rest that one might argue them without the delicate relations suggested by the Att, General—If the proposition to be retained had been made before I engaged to assist in the argument of these two claims I
should not have agreed to any proposition—The question about the title of the Indians with or without the Consent of the Spanish Government and a contract pending when the province of one Sovereign is transfered to another government, and the principles of National law applicable to it, cannot relate remotely to the powers of provincial officers, the composition of local Tribunals, the formalities of Spanish grants, the performance of conditions, the official letters on which concessions absolute and conditional were made—
These last are those which the Att’ General says it is indispensible to have, in the preperation of the cases below and for his government in the Supreme Court, —I am willing to undertake 1* to collect and furnish you with a reference to all the decrees, official letters commissions and instructions, laws and ordinances relating to the concessions of lands in Florida so far as I can, Copies of which can be sent to the District Attorneys for their information and government.
2" I will agree to furnish the Att’ General with a reference to all the laws and ordinances organizing Spanish Tribunals with those I
obtained from Cuba and from Spain, which will assist him in the defence of the suits now depending in the Supreme Court from Missouri and Arkansas as well as those to be instituted under the act of the last session in Florida.
3" I will engage to defend any suit against the U States instituted upon any title pronounced by the Board of which I was a member fraudulent, to furnish the evidence I have in relation to it, and to argue it in the Court below and in the Supreme Court if desired by the Atty General.
4* I will engage to assist in resisting the British claims in Florida in the Court below or in the Supreme Court.
It is known to you and the President that in the Treaty between England and Spain in 1783, it was stipulated that the British proprietors should sell out their possessions within a limited time," and if their value was such that it could not be done, a longer period should be allowed—as the Commissioners were not apprized of any proclamation of extension and forfeiture, they recommended the

confirmation of all British grants in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama not subsequently granted by Spain for confirmation and they have been confirmed. I ascertained that after the time limited in the treaty had expired the Spanish authorities allowed a longer period, and finally after several extensions, a formal decree of forfeiture was made.—This decree I obtained with great difficulty, and now have it. This document alone has saved a million of acres of land to the U. States, The fact of its existence is stated in our Report and no British title has been confirmed in Florida. Our Report is satisfactory to Congress but if the question is agitated in Court, the production of the authenticated document will be required.
I mention this as a single case to shew the magnitude of the interests of the government and the difficulty of the Subject.—If the President thinks the information I have collected in three years of laborious examination may be useful to the government I am willing to stipulate to receive the sum you mention for a retaining fee not to appear in any other cases than the two mentioned against the U. States and to perform the services stipulated above as well as I can. $1500 to be paid now & 1500 when I furnish the Att" General with a reference to the ordinances—To stipulate not to appear in thirty cases in which I should certainly be employed beside the fraudulent claims refered to and to perform a service that no other can, since the death of my colleague," I think must be considered by the President a reasonable compensation. I cannot undertake it for less. It might be demonstrated that this sum would be but a small commission on what has already been saved by my exertions to say nothing of the labor, vexation, confinement and persecution, consequent on my arduous services for three years in that office—No sum would be an adequate compensation for the vexation and calumnies I experienced for the honest discharge of my duty."

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE Aug 18" 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>TO THE CHIEF ENGINEER OF THE UNITED STATES
SIR. Agreably to my instructions,” I proceeded to make an examination of the river Appalachicola, & the obstructions to the navigation to said river, and have the honor to make the following report of their nature and extent and the effect that their removal will have upon the navigation above. I commenced my examination at the junction of the Flint and Chattahouchie rivers and descended in a boat with 4 men to the Appalachicola Bay, keeping the channel usually navigated by steamboats and other craft and ascertaing the depth of the same by sounding all the way with a lead line with the feet marked as high as 20. I find the obstructions to consist of 3 kinds viz 1" sand bars. 2" Drift wood in large deposites, extending entirely and forming in one place a complete dam across the river, 3" Isolated sawyers and snags in various points directly in the channel of the river.
The water immediately above the confluence of the two rivers above stated, is only 4 feet deep; sand bars of considerable width, say 300 yards in the narrowest place extending entirely across the two rivers, and subject to change their position at every high rise of the waters. At the head of the Appalachicola, the point where my examination commenced, I find 8 feet water and a good wide channel, which continues 3 miles down the river as far as a small island, immediately below which, there is a sand bar extending entirely across the river upon which there is only 4% feet water. This sand bar, together with the only other one 35 miles below at an island opposite to Blunt's town and having 6% feet water upon it, form the only obstruction to the navigation of the first enumerated class; the water in no other place on the river being less than 8 feet, and channel wide and regular, ie, invariably following the bends of the river except at the Ochesee Bluffs, where a ridge of rocks extends from the right bank nearly across, throwing the channel on the opposite point.
The removal of these sand bars, I apprehend, was not contemplated by the act of Congress. Below Blunt's Town down to the Bay the water is from 12 to 20 f* a distance of 100 miles.
There is a cut off, of one mile in length, which has become the only passage, in consequence of the main river, being at this time entirely stopped up by a sand bar, extending entirely across 4 or 5 feet above water. This cut off, is full of snags and sawyers of the most dangerous kind, and must al[so] be removed; they extend in many places nearly

across the channel and down the whole distance in clusters of 8 or 10
together, about 10 to 20 feet apart. The channel, however, is deep and the current rapid, ahé which will make them difficult of removal.
The next grand obstruction is at the River of Sticks, so called, about
10 miles further down. It consists of an accumulated mass of large trees with their roots, thrown up at each successive freshet, and forming a complete dam across the river, extending a quarter of mile down the river. The water is here backed up 3 feet perpendicular, and has vent only through a cut off, by a small passage 20 feet wide, cut by the crews of 2 Steam boats and 2 Keel boats, who were detained a week in the performance. The half of the appropriation must be expended on this obstruction, and here the work must be commenced. Steamboats cannot pass until this great obstruction be removed.
These 2 last enumerated form the obstructions of the 2" class.
The 3" class consists of isolated sawyers & snags at different points in the river from the junction of the Flint and Chattahouchie down to the Bay of Appalachicola, and measurably easy of removal with the proper means and force. I have written to this Department my former views and the mode I proposed to adopt for the removal of the obstructions; which was to build 2 flats 60 feet long 12 feet wide, attach them together, and erect Spanish windlasses thereon to draw out the snags and Sawyers after they are cut off sufficiently deep.
This mode requires the employment of 20 hands for the space of 3
months together with a considerable supply of cables hausers chains
&ca &ac &a which I find are not to be procured in this Territory:
I shall be, therefore, under the necessity of going to New Orleans to procure them. I therefore request that the funds of which I spoke in my last communication " may be deposited to my credit at New Orleans, where I shall be about the 20" of September next. I will, also, there purchase at less expense by 100 per cent the provisions &a for the supply of the hands, and have it transported to the Appalachicola Bay by the 1* of October, the season of the year when the river is at the lowest stage, and consequently the most proper time to commence operations. The effect of the removal of the obstructions will be that the river will be navigable at all seasons of the year as far as Aspalaga a new town on the left bank of the Appalachicola river about 8 miles from the junction of the Flint & Chattahouchie, for boats not drawing over 6% feet water, and three fourths of the year as far as the confluence, a distance of 144 miles from the Bay of Appalachicola. The Chattahouchie is navigable at all seasons

Bainbridge in Decatur County, Georgia, a distance of 45 miles from the confluence passing through a fine Cotton Country and possessing on their banks a body of lands not exceeded in fertility by any in the Southern Country. The Appalachicola River lands are no doubt equal to those of the Mississippi for the culture of sugar cane, and the value of these last, will be greatly enhanced by an uninterrupted navigation to the sea. The lands on all the above rivers that have lately come into market are settling rapidly and the time is not far distant when the Appalachicola and its tributary streams will waft on its surface millions of pounds of cotton from the up Country of Georgia and Allabama, and convey from its immediate borders the agricultural products of thousands of acres cultivated by wealthy & enterprising sugar planters, to a certain and easy market at the Haeuth ef Bay of Appalachicola. Such will be the certain effect of removing the obstructions to the navigation on this beautiful and majestic River.
It has been suggested to me, and I have no doubt of the fact from my own experience, that the employment of a small steamer of from

last matter and in the mean time request that their communications and funds to be forwarded to me at that place by the 1" of October for the purchase of cordage hawsers, chains & provisions when only the part of these articles are to be procured.
I proceed tomorrow to make, agreably to instructions, the survey of the river & harbor of St Marks and shall lay the report and map before the Department immediately after their completion."

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
(with its enclosures) under date the 25" July ” by the mail before last; I have Carefully perused the Several Communications enclosed.
and Cannot withhold an expression of Surprise at their Contents.
The Country South & east represented as So desireable, with the exception of a Small part on the Suwannee, if I am not entirely misinformed, is generally, so poor as not to admit Settlements; much the best part of it has been offered at the last Sales, and did not afford so much interest to buyers as to induce the purchase of a dozen lots, South of the Parallel: but of this you have the evidence in your possession—The suggestion of Majr. Ward that my Deputies, Sent to Survey South & east, this Spring as a reason for not Completing that work either found it “impracticable or unprofitable,” is, to Say the

least of it uncharitable, they are gentlemen acting under the Solemn obligation of an Oath, and possess a reputation that would repel the idea, that they would decline work which they were ordered to execute under the plea of its being unprofitable, of this fact they have given ample proof in the extremely unprofitable (and almost ruinous work) of laying down the private claims in West Florida.
The Major, I hope labours under a mistake in the idea entertained that his previous representations gave rise to your instructions to the Surveyor General. I trust Sir, that your instructions grow out of your Knowledge of the duties assigned you by your government and a direct Communication with this office—The great Solicitude of the Citizens to have that Section of Country run out, Seems not to have been generally expressed; as I am free to acknowledge it is new to me, and had they expressed Such Solicitude I could have given them a Knowledge of the measures taken on different occasions to have that Country Surveyed of which you have been regularly apprised,—my letter to you of July 3rd 1827.” gave my views of the necessity of having that Section of Country run out, and which required your authority for So doing, having been restrained by you in running So many Township lines—I beg leave to refer you to the third and fifth paragraphs of M. Washingtons letter,” and the enclosed “Official Documents” ” to satisfy you that “things are”
fairly “Conducted”. in this office. That part of your letter which relates to the immediate duties of this office together with the Contents of yours under date 1" inst "will be disposed of in a Separate Communication.
I feel that an apology is due for troubling you with this letter, but really Sir, I Consider it a paramount duty to place my official acts before you in their true light for many reasons, and not the least, that of retaining your good opinion.

<docbody>SIR, In your letter of instructions of the 25 July 1828" you direct that the Township lines of all the lands in West Florida, should be run, and the Surveys both public & private be entirely completed by July next.
Having received your instructions some time since not to survey those large tracts claimed by Forbes & C" and Innerarity, which lays in West Florida, doubt exist on my mind whether you intend by your late instructions to include them or not. Will you have the goodness to inform me what your present views are, on this subject, as I should deem it my duty under the late instructions to include those claims.
The instructions contained in your letter of the 1" of August
1828" received by the last mail & which relates to surveying of the private claims in West Florida, shall be immediately attended to—
The duties incident to laying down those claims, when the lands have been run out will be particularly distressing and ruinous to the Deputies employed, as I have no doubt a large portion of the claimants will pay no attention to their interest and the claims are so imperfect in their locations & land marks that it is impossible for the Surveyors to proceed without the Claimants identifying them in person.
These continued efforts on the part of the Government to induce Claimants to have their rights Secured, is Certainly praiseworthy, but on the other hand, how distressing to the persons employed in the execution of these duties, and withal, what an extension of duties and rendered more difficult involves upon this office.—I hope and trust that when the Surveys to the east are to be executed, that I shall be authorised to give timely notice and to finally close the surveys (as the Deputies progress) under the provisions of the Laws.
I have received a Copy of the Acts passed at the last Session, this evening by mail, also the revised Land laws as advised in your note.

<docbody>MY DEAR SIR—Your letter of the 4" ulto," thro some probable failure on the northern mail route was not received untill a few days since, and a misunderstanding about the departure of the Post boy from this neighbourhood prevented my replying. as I intended, by the last mail from Tallahassee—
I could have wished your letter of appointment to have been accompanied with the instructions of which you speak, as without them I do not feel prepared either to decline or accept of the situation proferred me—If the necessary examinations of the channel way to be improved have been made by the U S Engineers, and a plan for the execution of the work has been matured, and the appropriation made by Congress corresponds with or exceeds the estimates in the official report in your Department: you may consider this as my acceptance

of the commission to carry into effect the plan of the work proposed—
If however no examination of the Inland passage between the S*
Marys & St Johns has been made, and no report on the most advisable or feasible plan for the improvement of its navigation has been submitted to your consideration, and the appropriation made by Congress is an arbitrary sum granted on the vague representations of private Individuals; and your appointment is to be considered as conferring on me full powers with the consequent responsibility of accomplishing a speculative object within the pecuniary appropriation made, you must receive this as declining an appointment requiring, in the first place nearly a full season to make the preliminary examinations and to mature a plan for the work and fully another to execute the same with the possibility of being embarrassed from the sum allowed proving inadequate to the object to be accomplished—You will from the above readily comprehend the views I take of this subject—I cannot without a very great sacrifice of my private interests devote more than one season to the work contemplated, which however would be sufficient if the preliminary examination plans &c have been made;
and I would not hazard on inadequate means the possibility of a failure—If therefore from a knowledge of the facts you feel authorised to receive this as an acceptance of the appointment proferred me:
you will be good enough to forward without delay the necessary instruments, plans &c on the receipt of which I shall be prepared to commence operations—You will have no time to loose, as a portion of the first part of the season favourable to [the oper]ations contemplated will be lost in [MS. torn] preliminary arrangements which will have to be made—I shall be prepared to enter on the duties by the middle of October & shall expect to hear from you on all events by the 1 Week of the same month—I presume the contract system for the work to be performed will meet with your approbation & if so it will require some time in extending notices so as to elicit competition—
Should the agency of the work to be executed be confided to me under the views I have taken of the subject: I will thank you for instructions to draw upon you for a small amount in advance of my compensation:"

SIR I had the honor to receive by the last mail, yours of the 8"
Ultimo," relative to the quantity of land which should be reserved, for the use of this post.
In answer thereto, I have to report, that the lands, in the neighborhood, are excessively poor, and barren, and, that, they are not susceptible, of the least valuable cultivation. They are interspersed, with live oak hammocks, which may be considered, as, its only value, and no doubt, if, taken care of, are, and will be, of much national importance. The reservation, bearing in view, the exclusion of persons, disposed to sell ardent spirits, to the troops, should be so extensive, that the men, could not absent, themselves, for the time, which, it would require, to go, and return, from the houses, of those squatters, without being detected. The chief (and may be said) the only object of those settlers, is, to dispose of whiskey to the troops, and Indians, which they have, and continue to do, to the great annoyance of the command, and injury to the soldiers, and Indians.
I would therefore recommend, that the reservation, should commence from Gadsden point, (which separates, Tampa, from Hillsborough, bay, the latter ef of which, we are located on) along the eastern shore of Tampa, to its head, from thence, a due north course, to the Indian boundary line, then east, along this line, to a spot, opposite, the eastern side of the Thlonotossassa, hammock, (and including to said hammock) and from thence, a due south east course, til it strikes the Allaphia river, (with the islands, in the Hillsborough bay. A reservation less than this would be of little utility, because, if it does not extend, to the Indian line, those squatters, would establish themselves between the reservation, and the Indian boundary, by which location, they would be, both, in the immediate neighborhood of the Indians, and the Cantonment. This reservation, would extend from seven, to fifteen miles, and, in no instance, farther from the Post.
It would be desirable, that this reservation should be established, as soon, as practicable, as I have been informed, that several settlers, * See ante, p. 24, n.

may be expected here, shortly, whose views, no doubt, are for the purposes, stated above.
I am very respectfully Yr: mo: obt: Servt:

<place-time>Benvenue or Lockacray near Tallahassee FLORIDA September 11" 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, In obedience to the orders of the Engineer Department of the
30" June last, " I proceeded to make a survey of the River and Harbour of S’ Marks, Florida, with the view of ascertaining the practicability and expense of removing the obstructions to the navigation of the same. I commenced my operations at the natural bridge of the S" Marks (a distance of eighteen miles from the junction of the S" Marks and Wakully Rivers, and the point to which the navigation of small crafts had already extended, and at which it must of necessity stop) and proceeded as far as the extreme point of the shoals in the Bay of Appalachie embracing the whole of the the objects contemplated by the Act of Congress on this subject.
The River St Marks rises suddenly from the ground, and forms a beautiful basin of two hundred & fifty yards wide, and nearly a quarter of a mile in length, presenting to the delighted spectator a bold substantial stream of one hundred yards wide and continuing with occasional variations in its width to its confluence with the Wakully.
Its general course is South West.
I have found the obstructions in this river and harbour to be of two kinds, natural and casual or accidental. In the first six miles there

are two obstructions of the first class, or order; One a mile below the basin; and the other about two miles farther down the River. They both consist of a stratum of soft limestone rock running entirely across the river, about one hundred yards in width, and leaving only a depth of three feet water, for the passage of the Keel Boats. They would require a very considerable sum to remove them; but in as much as I
did not consider this class of obstructions enbraced within the Act of Congress or my instructions, I made no attempt to form any correct estimate of the amount required to remove them to the depth that would render the river, thus high up, susceptible of navigation for vessels frequenting the tide water below. A channel of twenty feet wide, and three feet deep, cut out of the rock, allowing a passage for boats drawing six feet water, would cost not less than three thousand dollars.
Many logs and trees have fallen from the banks on each side which in one instance at a small Island have nearly damed up the river, rendering the passage for Keel-boats very difficult and somewhat hazardous. They can easily be removed at a trifling expense. These last obstructions appertain to the 2" class.
About three quarters of a mile below the town of Magnolia, there is a casual of obstruction about one hundred yards long and twenty feet broad, lying at the bottom and paralel with the river, on the right bank, consisting of a deposite of mud and grass, the removal of which, would make the river navigable for vessels drawing ten feet of water at high tide. The peculiar locality of this deposit has thrown the whole volume of water on the left bank, and caused an increase in the current so as to form a very considerable rapid. The removal of this casual obstruction so as to make the river, thus far, in high tide, navigable for vessels drawing ten feet water would cost five hundred dollars; an inconsiderable sum, when the difference and draft of water to be obtained, is considered. Wessels drawing over six feet water are now under the necessity of lightening their cargoes before they can reach Magnolia, their post of destination, three fourths of a mile above. The river from this place presents no serious obstructions, if we except a few remnants of fallen timber near the banks, which the enterprising citizens of Magnolia have accidentally left in clearing the river of these accidental impedements to the navigation.
At Fort St Marks the depth of water in low tide is ten feet. The tide here ebbs and flows twice in twenty four hours, and rises not less than three, nor more than four feet, each tide. There are phenomena which do not occur in any of the rivers or harbours of the northern side of the Gulph of Mexico. The tide in all the other principal bays and rivers in this great Estuary ebbs and flows only

once in twenty four hours and never rises over two feet perpendicular on ordinary tides.
The next obstruction in the River (at this place called the Appalachie after its junction with the Wakully) is at the Middle ground, so called, about three miles distant from Fort S. Marks; and as one of those obstructions originally contemplated to be removed by the framers of the Act of Congress, but subsequently extended to the S" Marks river, properly so called. It must be observed that the channel of the river St Marks runs, & is nearly coequal with its width and follows its uniformly in its meanders, except at the points forming rapids:
but the moment we enter the Appalachie, the river and the channel are two distinct objects, and not at all dependent in their respective courses upon each other. I have therefore taken great care to lay down on the map the precise course of the channel with its depth at low water mark as well as the obstructions presented to view at the same stage of water, in order that the Department may more fully understand their nature and extent. The obstructions in this river Appalachie which are of the casual or accidental class have been considered in a two-fold point of view: first as to their peculiar locality, causing an angle in the channel; and secondly: as to their nature, as respects the materials of which they are composed. The one under contemplation, consists of two oyster bars, extending from either bank of the river, and so situated with regard to each other as to cause a right angle in the channel, and at same time blocking up a certain portion of it.
It has generally been considered by coastwise navigators that a channel not exceedingly tortuous of one hundred yards in width is sufficient for vessels in their trade, drawing generally when loaded from eight to ten feet water. In ascertaining the extent and making an estimate of the practicability an expense of removing an obstruction to the navigation of a river or harbour calculated only for the entrance of coasters of this large class, I was governed by this rule, and conceived, that only to be, in fact, an obstruction to the navigation, which embraced either or both these impediments. At the point now under consideration the channel is somewhat crooked, and the oyster-bar forms a point of projection forty-five yards, leaving a channel only fifty five yards wide and eight feet at low water mark.
It is proposed to cut off this point or bar forty five yards; and in order to make the water of equal depth with that in the channel above Wiz, ten feet, and to deepen the present one two feet more, making ten feet water at low tide, and a passage one hundred yards wide, tolerably straight. The point or bar as well as the bottom of the channel, is composed of Oysters in bed, and in detached parcels.
This spot is designated on the map by the colour of red.

The next and main obstruction in the channel of the river is the one at a place called “the Devils Elbow,” and designated on the map by the colour of blue. It is composed of the same materials as the preceeding one, and differs only in its extent, and the acuteness of the angle, and the width of the channel and the depth of the water.
The channel is very crooked, and narrow, being only twenty-five yards wide and the water very shallow only six and a half feet deep.
In making an estimate of the expense of removing this, and the preceeding obstruction, I was governed entirely by the mode to be pursued in their removal.
I propose to the consideration of the Department the following method of removing these two last enumerated obstructions. The improved Mud Machine now in use for clearing out the docks and rivers on the Atlantic Sea-board, is undoubtly the only cheap mode of effecting an excavation in places of this sort, and could be used to great advantage in the river and harbour of S’ Marks.
It may be objected that these machines are only used in removing soft mud, and that they are not applicable to purposes of this kind:
but from the knowledge I have of their capacities to remove any loose bodies under water, I am convinced, that their application to the removal of Oyster-bars would be attended with complete success;
provided the materials of which these bars are composed, were so loosened and detached as to enable the scoop of the machine to embrace their contents in detached portions. I propose to detach and loosen the Oyster-bars by means of iron-crow-bars sharpened and flattened at one end. The operators must stand in a flat or scull moored at the proper place, and I have no doubt that four hands in a day would detach as many of the oysters or clamps on the bar as the machine would raise and deposit in the scow. Admitting the cost of the mud machine to be fifteen hundred dollars, together with the flat and utensils; I think I hazzard not too much in saying that an additional sum of five thousand dollars would be amply sufficient to remove every obstruction in the Appalachie River and make it navigable for vessels drawing thirteen feet water.
From this point there exist no farther obstructions to the navigation. There are, it will be perceived, many Oyster-bars and shoals in the Bay, laid down on the map, but the passage through them being at the narrowest, not less than one hundred and fifty yards wide and increasing the nearer we approach the Sea, Bay to the width of a quarter of a mile, I have deemed it unnecessary to make an estimate of the expense of removing any other of the bars; as the channel, independently of its increased width, is not very tortuous, and the depth of the water, fourteen feet, being one foot more than is proposed
446774–59–6 |

to take up to Fort S" Marks by the removal of the Oyster-bars at the localities, already mentioned.
With the view of facilitating the entrance of vessels into the harbour of S’ Marks, I respectfully recommend to the Department the necessity of an appropriation for the establishment of buoys and beacons on the shoals in the Bay of Appalachie, and the mouth of the river. A pair of Beacons on the shoals, would be sufficient, and about a dozen buoys, on the principal Oyster-bars at the mouth of the River, would render the navigation at all times more easy and certain and less precarious and more durable than the Stakes put up by the Pilot, for his own special guidance."

ROB" BUTLER, Esq S Gen.' Tallahassee. F.
SIR. In reply to your letter of the 1st Ins".” I have to state that I
do not perceive any necessity for extending, for the present, the Township line thro’ the Tracts claimed by Forbes & C°.
I am well aware of the embarrassments experienced by the Deputy Surveyors arising out of the negligence of the claimants to come forward and designate such claims as are not so distinctly described in the records on which they were confirmed as to enable the Deputy to find & survey them without the aid of the claimant and I very much regret that there has been an omission in all the Laws confirming private claims to make provision for compelling the claimants to have their Lands surveyed within a given period. There is a necessity on the part of the Gov" for surveying those claims in order to ascertain the public Lands subject to Sale. The 7th Sect. of the Act passed the
8th of February 1827.” directs the manner in which this shall be done and all that can be expected of the Executive Officers is that they procure all the information which the public archives contain of the locality and description of each claim, and use due diligence &
precaution in carrying into effect the instructions given under the provisions of that Section. When these means will not enable you to lay

down a private claim the lands must be surveyed as public lands and the parties left to establish the locality of their claim in a Court of Justice—but as this latter course will necessarily produce embarrassment to the Gov" as well as to the claimant you will perceive the expediency & necessity of using such precautions in having the claims surveyed as will take from the claimant any just cause of complaint, and that will exempt your Dep" from censure.—
The papers enclosed in my letter of 25 July" were submitted as the opinions of respectable Gentlemen, and that upon re-inquiry you might take such measures for the survey & subdivision of any of these Lands that you might deem necessary—and I place entire confidence in your judgement & discretion as to the practicability of running the Township lines, and subdividing such of them as are Saleable."

SIR, Your report on the removal of obstructions to the navigation of the Apalachicola River has been received," & I am instructed, by the Chief Engineer, to say that it is, as far as it goes, very satisfactory, but it is necessary that a detailed estimate of the expense of effectually removing the obstructions should be made, in order that if the sum actually appropriated should be found insufficient for that purpose, the additional amount required may be embraced in the general estimates of this Department for the ensuing year—The employment of a steam boat whilst the sum appropriated is so small, is deemed a hazardous experiment, & the other method you propose for carrying on the operations (by means of flat boats & windlasses) will therefore be adopted, & your plan of commencing at the lower obstructions is approved—To enable you to carry the project into effect, a requisition is this day made for $1500 to be deposited to your credit in the Branch of the U. S. Bank at New Orleans agreeably to your request—With respect to the removal of the lower obstructions, at the place called the
“River of sticks,” it is suggested whether it will not be more feasible to

improve & render navigable the small cut which has been made round them than to remove the obstructions themselves, & you are requested to make, before proceeding with your operations, a Comparative estimate of the Cost of each mode which will enable you to give the preference to the most efficient & economical one."

<source>[LC:Pensacola, Florida Argus, Nov. 4, 1828*]</source>
<place-time>TALLAHASSEE, Oct. 6, 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY WM. P. DUVAL, SIR, Having in the fall of 1826 at your request, accepted the agency for the location of the Seminary Lands in this Territory, and having completed the locations, as nearly as is thought consistent with the interests of the Territory, under present circumstances. I think it proper to lay before you the result of my labours, and to present for your consideration and opinion, whether under present circumstances, the location of a portion of the land, should not be deferred for the present until the public surveys are further prosecuted. It will be recollected that an act of Congress, approved 3d March, 1823, granted for a Seminary of learning in the Territory, a township of land in each of the Districts of East and West-Florida.” Under this act, and in pursuance of your directions, I proceeded to the examination of the country West of the Suwanee river, and after a most minute and careful [examination]” of a great number of Townships, assisted by Major Romeo Lewis and others, I made choice of, and selected, Township 5, North of range 11 West, situated West of the Chippola river, in the county of Jackson. The Register of the Land-Office at this place had due notice of the selection, as had your excellency, by the agent's report. The Government of the United States afterwards sold to preemption claimants, nearly one-third of the Township selected. By an act of Congress, approved 29th January, 1827, it is provided that the deficiency may be supplied by locating the quantity covered by those claims in “sections upon any unappropriated lands in said district of country.” *—This last act also provides for the location of the remaining Township in sections, East of the Appalachicola River. It therefore became necessary to re-examine the country West and East of that river, and to be much more special and minute in the examination, than was required in the observations previously taken, with a view to the selection of the best Township, as was provided by the act of 1823. I have succeeded in obtaining about 22 Sections East, and about 8 West of the Appalachicola River, and probably from 3
to 6 others may be located to tolerable advantage East of the Oscilla river, in a tract of country already surveyed. There will then remain about 14 sections to be located which I have no doubt may be hereafter laid upon valuable lands; but at present, and under the law as it now

reads, it is impossible to obtain lands of much value. It is therefore respectfully submitted whether it is not proper to hold in reserve a portion of those lands to be disposed of according as after events may suggest. In relation to the quality and situation of the lands already selected, I will merely remark, that they are believed to have been been located, all circumstances considered, to the very best advantage, and that with very few exceptions, they could be readily sold at fair prices, and the agent can with great confidence assure your Excellency, that he has exerted all reasonable industry and diligence, and in many instances incurred considerable money expenses, to obtain for the Seminary the most eligible situations and the best lands. A list of the lands selected, and maps shewing the situation of each tract will be furnished if thought necessary.”
With highly respectful considerations, Your ob’t. servant, R. C. ALLEN.

<place-time>WASHINGTON CITY, October 6* 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Agreeably to your request, I communicate to you the informations in my possession in relation to the Inland-Passage from S“Mary's harbour (G") to St John river (F*).
Two water communications might be opened between S" Mary's harbour and S" John river: one for boats through what is called Inland-Passage, and which, on account of the numerous, short and narrow windings, could not admit of the passage of sloops unless large expenditures should be made. The other should be a thorough cut canal from Bell river to a branch of Nassau river and would form a link of the contemplated line of inland navigation along the atlantic coast.
In regard to the former or present existing communication, the ports where the tides meet are those that require improvement; they are denoted in red ink on the map surveyed under the direction of L* Colonel Perrault.”
The first obstruction is found between St Mary's harbour and Nassau river; it consists of a shallow channel, two miles in length, * A petition by the Legislative Council of Florida for permission to dispose of lands reserved for schools and seminaries was referred to the House Committee on Public Lands, Jan. 28, 1828 (House Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., p. 225). No report has been found.

left dry at low tide, and affording about three feet at high tide.—To improve this channel to a depth of four feet at common half tide and on a width of thirty feet, the expense would be about . . . $8.400.
The Second obstruction, between Nassau river and Talbot inlet, is
700 yards in length; it is left dry at low tide.—To improve this channel to a depth of four feet at common half tide and on a width of twenty yards, the expense would be about . . . . . . . . . . . . $3.300. The third obstruction, between Talbot inlet and the S" John, has a length of four hundred yards and is but one foot deep at low tide.—
The improvement of this place, on a convenient width, would cost about . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1.400
The fourth and last obstruction is at the Sisters: it is a narrow bar which would require for its improvement about . . . . . . $340.
Therefore to render the Inland Passage navigable through out, at half common tide, for boats not drawing more than three feet and a half, an expense of 13.440 dollars will be necessary and would be sufficient should the work be judiciously directed.”

I have the honor to return the T. plats inclosed with your letter of the 13" Ult°* and to remark in explanation that the Escambia River was not laid down, owing to an oversight of the Draftsman and escaped our observation in the general examination—You will observe a difference in the appearance of the Conecuh River on the township plats arising from the fact of having a meridian run on the west, which differs in a small degree from the paralels of the surveys East; they having been extended under many difficulties of swamps, water courses, and bad ground—The necessity for this course was made manifest by the representations of the Dep’ surveyer that in many places the connection could not be made across that river and therefore the survey was connected with its margin giving rise to the small difference observable.

<docbody>SIR I had the honor a few weeks ago of addressing you a letter in reply to your communication concerning the prevention of the cutting of valuable timber upon the Public Lands.” In my letter I omitted to mention one class of depredators upon the public lands who inflict more injury than they who merely cut the Public Timber for sale I
mean the squatters upon the lands lyeing on the waters of Pensacola Bay which are suitable for Brick Yards. Since the date of my letter I have been informed of several Brick Yards which have been recently established and of its being had in contemplation by individuals here

to establish others upon the public land The clay throughout this country is to be found in small spots only. and these spots when favorably situated upon water courses are very valuable. It is belived that the only clay in the U States of which fire bricks can be made is to be found in the neighborhood of this place and the few bricks which have been sent from here for sale, to New York & Philadelphia have sold at from $40 to $50 per thousand. (But the loss of the clay is not the least evil which the government will suffer, since the timber on the neighboring lands will be consumed with very little regard to its quality in burning the Bricks.
Two of the Brick Yards about to be established are intended to be carried on very extensively.

John Drysdale to the Quartermaster General S*AUGUSTINE 30 July 1828
SIR I beg respectfully to ask your attention to the accompanying resolutions of the Board of Aldermen of this City—In the discharge of the duty which these resolutions impose upon me little more is necessary on my part than to lay them before you The deep interest which this City has in the expeditious and substantial construction of the Bridge in question and in the faithful application of the means appropriated by the Government for this purpose will it is not doubted be appreciated by you as a just cause for the present claim upon your Consideration.
The great diminution of the force originally employed in this work by the removal of twenty four men and one officer from a detachment consisting of ninety men, which took place about three weeks since, was seen by the inhabitants of this City with much regret, as tending materially to retard its progress, while the current and continuing expenditures to be met out of the appropriation for the work were understood to be very immaterially, if at all, reduced by this reduction of force—But now that the work is entirely suspended, and, as it is understood, will continue so until the month of October, the City authorities have felt they would be wanting in duty, if they refrained from soliciting your interference—The suspension of this work is alleged to have taken place under a general order having in view the preservation of the health of the troops in warm climates—Though this

climate bea warm one, it is respectfully suggested that, in this particular part of the Country, it is not only an innoxious but an extremely salubriousand healthful climate; and that during no part of the Summer are the ordinary labors of those whose avocations expose them to its unmitigated influence, abandoned or suspended—It is therefore believed that the troops engaged in this work might labor with entire security during seven or eight hours in the day; yielding to their unclimatized constitutions, if indeed they be unaccustomed to a warm climate, repose during the extreme heat of the day;-thereby saving very considerably of the limited appropriation allowed for the construction of this Bridge and the necessary Causeways—The Causeways designed to connect the Bridge with the main land being left in an incomplete state, with several unfinished sluices through them, cannot it is believed be thus subjected to the ordinary action of the tide without suffering very material injury; and much fear is entertained that if this work be allowed to remain in the condition in which it is at present until the month of October, it will not only be much impaired, but will in all probability—be wholly destroyed by the equinoxial storms of the approaching autumn, from which we are rarely entirely exempted—
These considerations together with the resolutions on which they are founded are submitted to you very respectfully, and under a perfect conviction that you will not only see the reasonableness of the anxiety of the municipal authorites of this place on the subject to which they refer; but that you will by every means in your power promote and secure to the inhabitants of this part of the Territory the benefits designed by the Government in the appropriation of the public money for the object in question—I have the honor to be respectfully Sir Your Ob"S"

Resolution of the Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Augustine CouncIL ROOM July 26" 1828
Whereas the appropriation lately made by the General Government for Constructing a bridge over the S. Sebastians river being too limited for the purpose; Lieut. Harvey Brown was authorised in aid of said appropriation to construct said Bridge, with the assistance of a detachment of U.S. Soldiers, previously employed in opening public roads, and then under the Command of Said Lieut. Brown; And

where as even with this additional aid of the U.S. Soldiers, said appropriation may be insuficient unless said work be conducted without any unnecessary obstacles thrown in the way to its completion:
And whereas said work is necessarily retarded by the removal of a Number of the Soldiers who have been employed on it. And whereas it is at present entirely stopped, and said bridge left in an unfinished State, in consequence of Same Order to the Officer now Commanding Said detachment of Soldiers—that the Said Soldiers discontinue the work untill September or October Next. And whereas said appropriation now Small is consuming away by the heavy expences necessarily incurred during the Suspension of said work. And whereas these circumstances not only prevent a speedy completion of Said bridge, but may eventually defeat it altogether, Therefore, Resolved that the construction of Said bridge is a matter of deep interest to the Citizens of this place, and they view with concern any unnecessary interruption in the work which tends to delay, and may eventually prevent the Completion of so desirable an object.
Resolved that a representation be made through the Mayor to the Quarter Master General, of the present condition of Said bridge and the circumstances which delay and will probably prevent its completion—and that he be respectfully solicited to permit the number of soldiers already removed, and such as may be hereafter removed, to be replaced by an equal number of others; and that the said Lieut. Brown be permitted to proceed with the Soldiers to finish and complete said bridge.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE October 15th 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. Your communication of the 23"September has been received."
The peculiar nature of the deposites of drift wood and timber, and large trees, together with their peculiar localities, render a correct estimate of the sum required to remove them effectually, almost a matter of impossibility. I have in addition to my own experience founded on a personal examination of the obstructions to the navigation of the Appalachicola River taken great pains to acquire information from persons formerly engaged in removing similar obstructions on the Altamaha, and they have coincided in opinion, with me as to the number of hands necessary to be employed and the time requisite in a good stage of water, to remove effectually those on the Appalachicola. It has been my endeavour, in making the estimate transmitted to the Department, to confine the expenses within the amount of the appropriation; and I have since my reconnoissance of the river, entertained no doubt, that the appropriation is sufficient for the object.
Indeed, upon a subsequent examination of the “river of sticks”
from which I have just returned, I had come to the resolution of removing the island as suggested, and rendering navigiable the cut or thoroughfare, as suggested in your communication, considering it as the only mode of securing uninterruptedly the navigation of this important river at this place.
For the purpose of making the Department better acquainted with the peculiar locality of this obstruction, I have sketched a map of the river for a half a mile above and below the place called the
“River of Sticks”. I have also marked the channel (by dots,) as it actually exists, and laid down the islands and the relative situation of the existing obstructions.
It must be observed that the channel of the Appalachicola follows and probably more regularly depends upon its sinuosities (with one exception, viz at a place called the Ochessee Bluffs, where a stratum of rock extending nearly across the river, throws the channel on the point) than any river in North America; the deepest water being invariably, if unobstructed by fallen timber from the banks; within a few yards of the shore, in the cavities or bends of the river.
The large island on the west side, was, I have no doubt, originally a part of the Point, and the channel ran, agreably to the above premises, between it and the small island on the East side, and also in high freshets though the cut, between it and the East Bank of

the River: but the small island (er; at that time the only island)
from its peculiar situation near the bend on the East side, served in no small degree to force the ehahhel current towards the point upon the West side of the river; (particularly in high freshets, when the head of the cut or thoroughfare on the East side became blocked up by drift wood and trees) and requiring consequently a greater vent, than was afforded, between the then Point on the West side and this island, it forced its way through the low ground, behind the then point, and formed a new course for itself, which from its width and depth previously to its being filled up, as represented on the map, has been deemed by Boatmen, to be the real channel of the River.
But, subsequently, by the deposite of drift wood on the point of the newly formed island, and its accumulation farther down, this new channel became entirely filled up; a circumstance owing, no doubt, to the decrease of the island on the East side; the channel between which and the-Point island increased in width in the same ratio.
In this stage of the process, it would appear, that nothing more would be required than to have waited the results of future freshets, the effect of which would in time, entirely remove the small island, and thereby cause the channel to move in its natural (with respect to the bend of the river) course, without the least danger of a future deposite;
but, it so happened, that the accummulation of drift wood and trees ea on the point island has latterly been greater than the decrease of the small island, and at this time extends within twenty feet of the lower point of it, and the cut or throroughfare between this small island and the East shore, being, at its head, entirely blocked up by a sand bar and a considerable deposite of driftwood also, it necessarily follows that in order to insure a permanent channel not liable to be obstructed, the small island, as well as the deposite of drift wood, or dam between the two islands ought to be entirely removed; all which I had come to the determination to do; and have made my arrangements accordingly: my hands are nearly all engaged, and will be in readiness when the flats are finished: In the meantime I shall now hasten to New Orleans to purchase hawsers, ropes tackel &ca &ca, which I informed the department could not be procured in this part of the Territory, and hope to be in successful operation on the River Sticks in two weeks from date: our Packets generally perform the trips to NewOrleans in two weeks and sometimes less.
With regard to the comparative expense of removing the obstructions at the above place on the Appalachicola, in the mode already communicated to the Department and the one above suggested, I
have no hesitation in declaring the latter mode of removing the island and rendering navigiable the Cut or thoroughfare, to be the least

p
* the Rivere SIHIIICOLA e ole atruuc t - on-
Le c alle dl :


expensive in the end; as well as the only one by which the navigation can be made permanent and not subject to future obstructions. This island is 200 yards long and 55 yards wide in the widest place. I
propose to cut several small channels through the island, and suffer the current to pass through. the depth of the channel or cuts would be 8 feet, which is the height of the island above the surface of the water, and the width from 4 to 6 feet. wide; then cuts would, from the peculiar composition of the island soon enlarge themselves; and by assisting the operation with the spade after having previously removed the timber and trees, I have no doubt that in a short time the whole island might in this way be removed, and open thereby a larger space for the water to pass, reduce it to its natural level (ahd it is 2% feet higher above the obstruction or dam) and enable me to work away with greater facility the drift and timber between the two islands. When this is effected I shall consider the half of my commission as executed. After I shall have completed the removal of the obstructions at the place called the River of Sticks, I will report progress to the Department, and proceed, if the stage of the water permit, to the removal of the remaining obstructions"

Until the public lands are generally, in any particular neighborhood brought into market, it would be considered as a harsh measure to prohibit the use of Public timber for fuel or for plantation purposes.

SIR, I have the satisfaction to state, to you, for the information of the department of war, that at a meeting of chiefs and others of the Seminole Nation held yesterday at M*Kenzie's Pond, near this Agency, pursuant to appointment made by me, for the purpose of procuring the nation to send a deputation to examine the Country West of the Mississippi; it was determined, that the measure should be adopted, if still called for by the Government, and a deputation Sent, at the opening of the ensuing Spring—The Chiefs in Council were Hicks (Head Chief) Holata Emathla; Holata Mico, Fuke lustee Hajo, Hitchitee-Mico, Tuskumhaw. & the Sub Chief Mad-Lizard.—
The four first named will doubtless be recollected by you, as a part of the delegation which visited the Seat of Government in 1826." Their wishes tribes, with two or three others, not represented in the meeting, but which may be safely relied upon to join, should the wished for emigration take place; comprises at least two thirds of the numerical strength of the whole nation.
I have good reason to suppose, that this unexpected determination on the part of the Chiefs above mentioned, has been induced (among other reasons) by my volunteering to accompany them, on the proposed excursion; which I was led to do; from a belief, that the step, as primary to a final removal of the Nation, is desired by the Government: and a conviction I have long felt, that Such removal, under suitable and fair circumstances, would tend to the benefit & happiness of the Indians themselves:—distressed as I know these people are, by irremidiable evils within the present limits of their National Territory, & harassed by the persecution of their neighbors without and judging

from the reputed character of the new country offered to them, I think it may be confidently calculated, that a visit to it, will result in a general & entire removal of the Nation.—If I have understood the views of the Government aright on this subject, and the measure proposed, receives its approval; little desirable to any one, in point of personal convenience and comfort, as the duty of executing it, must necessarily be; it will nevertheless afford me gratification, to be instrumental in carrying it into effect; especially, as my engaging in it, seems to be considered a point of so much importance by the Indians—
In conferring, as I have, with the chiefs, in relation to the suggested journey; I have acted, it is true, without any formally delegated authority; but I have at the same time, been influenced, by a wish to promote the object of the department & should the steps I have taken be sanctioned, it will be to me, matter of pride:—If, on the contrary, the disapprobation of the department should be awarded to me, a notice to that effect, will easily correct the error and do away all that has been done "—
The substance of the talk, which forms the basis of this communication, will be found herewith enclosed.”

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs, 1" November, 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>To THE HON* PETER B. PORTER, Secretary of War, SIR, In compliance with your directions * I have the honor to submit the following brief report on the charges which have been made against Colo. Humphreys, the Indian Agent, in Florida, and to submit the more detailed letters and papers in support of them;
together with explanations &c by himself.
In a general way, for two years complaints have been made, thro'

Col° White of Florida,” as the delegate of those who felt aggrieved, and others, charging the agent with a want of disposition to aid them in recovering their run-away Slaves.” From time to time orders were issued from this Office of the most peremptory character,” perfectly to the satisfaction of the claimants, who, however, always responded that they would have no avail since Col° Humphreys was determined not to assist them in the recovery of their prosperity. At last, special charges, more serious in their nature came in—The first—I report is made by a M. Kingsley.” He charges the agent with having kept one of his Slaves on his own farm under a borrowed name, one year after he had applied for him; and states the confession of the identity was only extorted from the agent, at last, by his having got secret information of the identity, when he was given up. The agent's defence was, he was not known to be the same negro. He charges him also with having kept, for a whole year, Mr. Cooks negroes after he had been positively ordered by the Secretary of War to give them up.
Second—A report of the Legislative Council and resolution, strongly implicating the agent with an illicit trafic in slaves, and with being opposed to the emigration of Indians from Florida "-but no proof accompanies it.
Third—A letter from J. M. Hanson, unfavorable to the agents veracity, and charging the trouble Mr" Cook has had to his indisposition to carry the orders of the Department into effect."
Fourth—Another letter detailing the vexatious state of things in regard to the agents conduct, and says if the War Department was informed of the dissatisfaction that exists among the people of the Territory, generally, against Col”. Humphreys, he would be removed immediately. It is certainly true that great dissatisfaction does exist.
Col”. Humphreys pleads his inability to do more than he does to meet their wishes in regard to their Slaves.
Fifth—A letter from Archibald Clark, charges the agent with opposing obstacles to the recovery of Slaves on the grounds that the bondsman which were required to be given in security to abide the final issue of a trial, did not live in Florida *—After detaining the

Messenger thirty days, keeping up meanwhile, the impression that the bonds were acceptable. The letter is a strong one, and I know no excuse that can be offered for the agent in the course he took. I
consider him as having, by his conduct, virtually put at definace the order of the Department—The plea he makes that security within the Territory was necessary, cannot be sustained, since it was not required.
Sixth—Charges against the agent upon oath. William Everett swears that he went to the agency to claim seven negroes.” The demand for them was made in writing. The agent promised to convene the Chiefs to consult them about the delivery of the Slaves.
Affiant waited a long time, but the Chiefs were not called together.
The Chiefs when called, declined to take and deliver the Slaves.—
The agent then proposed to buy the Slaves. It was refused. But finally it was agreed to sell and at a reduced price two of them, they being all over whom the affiant and the person with him had control.
The terms of the agent were accepted from a belief that unless they were, all would be lost. He has no doubt but the Chiefs would have brought in the Slaves had the agent directed it. Affiant has been much about the agency, and from what he has seen, and knows, has no doubt the agent is engaged in speculating in the purchase of Slaves among the Indians—that instead of aiding in their recovery, he raises obstacles in order to purchase them at reduced prices. He does not believe that any man has a reasonable hope of obtaining slaves from the Indians unless the agent will do his duty, with more zeal and sincerity than he has witnessed in his own business. The slaves sold to the agent had never been seen until after the sale, when he saw one of them. The others, the agent told Affiant he had seen, and that they would come to him.
This testimony being on oath, and transmitted by the Governor entitles it to credit. But whether the agent could break the force of it by any opposing testimony is not known. If the case be as it is stated, without any palliating circumstances the agent cannot be justified. Indeed he was expressly forbid buying Slaves, by this office, under the usual sanction, and authority of the Department of War. This express order it appears he has disregarded.
The agent is charged by J. M. Hanson, with employing workmen in erecting buildings for his own use, and charging the cost to the Government—the buildings referr'd to, are, a house for a sugar mill." Mr. Hanson says the above can be proved. Other work as reported by a respectable mason to Mr. Hanson, amounting to 170, * No affidavit by Everett found.

or 180 Dollars, was, about one half of it, setting sugar Kettles for the agent, was included by the agent as work done for the United States—The agent giving the mason his own private note for the amount, which has not been yet paid. This, it is asserted, can be proved. Hanson promises to prefer charges, and meanwhile asks the Governor to with hold the money for the agency House—as he will be able to prove the accounts unjust.
Governor Duval considers it important that the conduct of the agent be inquired into, but by some one other than a Citizen of Florida—whose feelings could be warped no way.
I submit herewith Col° Humphreys explanations &", N° 7 and 8."—
The remarks I respectfully add to this hasty synopsis, are, there exists against the agent great excitement in Florida—He is loudly, and constantly complained against, and has been for two years—the directions of the Department have not been conformed to by him, on the questions of difficulty—His answers, and reasons appear evasive—
The charges against him on oath, are serious, and if not met, would make his removal indispensable. But whether true or not, such is the excitement against the agent in Florida, and especially since the Governor has assumed the relation to him which he has, as to make his services in that quarter of but little, if any use to the Government whilst his dealing in Slaves in direct violation of an express order forbidding it, indicates a feeling of insubordination which makes it questionable whether orders on any other subject would be met differently. If not it is manifest that the duties of the agency could be more acceptably performed by some one else."
Respectfully submitted.
THO" L. McKENNEY.

<docbody>TO GEORGE GRAHAM Esq. Gen' Land Office Treasury Dep"
SIR. With referrence to my Communication of this date,” I have again to call your attention more Especially to the claim of John

Forbes & C* now of record on the Equity side of the District Court, and subject to my controul as the District Attorney of Middle Florida.—It is Scarcely necessary to remind you of the importance of this claim, but I consider it my duty to give the department to understand, that the Claimants have filed in this Cause a documentary title of a most formidable character, linking together their chain of evidence so strong, as to require on the part of the government the most decided vigilance—
First then I will bring to your notice the leading facts, and Secondly I will point out, the only remedy in my humble opinion we can apply to arrive at the true merits of this claim.—
It must be borne in mind, that Messrs White & Overton in their report of this Case, as commissioners of the United States, made an unfavourable report "thereon, but now the claimants produce a host of documents, said to be obtained since the report.—But where do they Spring from? Havanna the residence of Colin Mitchel one of the Petitioners before the Court.—I am not disposed lay aside the ordinary Charities which I profess to ascribe to human actions generally, but Spanish documents of Sudden Concoction, brew" and brought into esse to day, which ought to have been produced yesterday, touching and concerning a pretended contract of thirty or more years, is rather Suspicious to Say the least.—
I find upon examination of their documents, Eighteen of them are certified as of record from Havanna.—Now Some of them, indeed, the principal portion of them, might as well have been produced pending the Commission, as at this crisis.—Why it was neglected, the investigation I am about to Suggest, may possibly lead to an answer, to this suggestion then I will now call your immediate attention.—
Believing as I sincerely do, from my Knowledge of the Spanish character, that the documents now on file in this Case, purporting to be on record at Havanna are not genuine and believing moreover, from all the Circumstances, that the Officers at Havanna have been operated upon in this matter, as in most other public duties Confided to them, the United States cannot safely go into the merits of this claim, unless they open a commission at Havanna.—It must be borne in mind, that the Congress of the United States have extended to the Claimants an unprecedented privelege, placing their claim upon the very pinnacle of Equity, backed by all the doors that open to every Species of Foreign evidence—The government then in this aspect of the case, can only rebut the introduction of improper and evasive

documents, by going to, and prying into the very records from which they profess to obtain their documentary title—
I propose to open a commission at Havanna, and attend the execution of it myself.—It may be well to explain, why Mr Brent's the law Agent will not have it in his power to attend to this matter, though this gentleman will do So, yet, it will lead to great delay, a consequence much to be dreaded by the friends and well wishers of this last Southern offspring of our republic.—
His business at St. Augustine and Pensacola will occupy him the Coming winter, and he is then desirous of returning home, to arrange his affairs, So as to attend this Court, and other Courts Early in the Spring—I would Suggest, that the government procure me letters from the Spanish minister at Washington, and from such other persons, as would lead to an acquaintance with the influential public functionaries at Havanna—I would further suggest, that the Consul and Commercial Agent of the United States be instructed to aid and give me every facility in his power—I would further suggest, that the government authorize and instruct me, to employ an intelligent Spanish lawyer, to aid me in the investigation, and in the execution of the Commission—I would further suggest, that the government authorize me to purchase such Spanish works, as may tend to throw light upon this Subject—
With this authority I can no doubt bring to light important facts.—
I am informed here, that there is a regular Packet plying between Key West and Havanna—leaves Key West every other day.—I can reach Key West from here in one or two ways—either by going via Pensacola, or watch an opportunity from St: Marks by water—The court of Appeals of this Territory will meet the first monday in Febr January, and will adjourn in five or Six days.—Immediately after the adjournment of this Court, I will Set out in the execution of this important duty, Should my government view it in this light, if not, my mind will be relieved from the responsibility I apprehend in this Cause.—If the government Should deem it important, to Send me upon this business, be pleased to say, I would wish my instructions to be full and clear as to the extent of my powers, and would not like to act with any discretion, unless under imperative circumstances incident to Such a mission—I would call your attention to another important fact—The Petitioners call for 1,200,000.—acres, and I am credibly informed that the claim will mete 2,000,000 of acres.—I am not apprized from the present Situation of this Case, whether it will be necessary to order a Survey of the claim—if I should make up my mind to do So, I will of course inform the Department.—I would Suggest, that this Communication be referred to the Attorney General, who may be able to

give Some additional hints, -besides his opinion as to the utility of my suggestions."—

<docbody>SIR Your letter of the 7" Ulto:” was received last evening—I
regret that Gen" Bernards absence from Washington prevented an immediate reply to my communication of the 4" of September"—
The time which had elapsed had encouraged the belief, that that letter had been received as a non-acceptance on my part of the agency for superintending the improvement of the navigation of the inland passage between the St Marys and S" Johns Rivers," and that other arrangements had been adopted for the forwarding a work of so much importance to the Inhabitants of that part of Florida.—As however this appears not to be the fact and you still depend upon my services, 

(notwithstanding the preliminary examinations of the channel way to be improved are not more matured than I expected:) I wish to prevent any further delay in the commencement of operations by our correspondence, proceed as early as practicable to the S" Johns; make the examinations of the obstructions at the points designated in the inland passage proposed to be improved: and prepare a report, as you request, accompanied with an estimate of the probable cost of their removal and of the expences to be incurred in carrying on the work during the remainder of the present year—I will immediately issue for proposals from those willing and capable of contracting for the whole or parts of the work to be accomplished, as well from those who would prefer furnishing labour—So that we may be able to decide on the most effectual and advantageous mode of conducting the operations contemplated.—I must confess in a Country like this where laborers are owned: and where none but the laborers of the country can be depended on or have been accustomed to the climate that my preference inclines to the contract system with Responsible Individuals; adding to the security by making no payments but for work performed.—
Should I therefore receive offers from Individuals of the description alluded to I shall proceed immediately to the commencement of the work, bestowing upon it such occasional personal attention as will ensure the faithful performance of their contracts.—If however this be impracticable (of which) you will receive the earliest information, and the work must be conducted under the immediate direction of the Governmental Agent as this will require more of my personal attendance than I can possibly bestow: I shall expect to be relieved by some Officer from your Department, or receive instructions to transfer the superintendance to some other Individual.—
As I shall at present need funds only to meet the expences of the preliminary examinations contemplated I will thank you to forward me to Tallahassee a check on the Bank of New Orleans, or a draft on the Receiver of Public monies at Tallahassee for 500 dollars.
The Enclosed you will oblige me by delivering without delay to Gen Bernard.”

<dochead>THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO WILLIAM H. HUNT</dochead>
<source>[NA:PO, PMG Letter Book V]</source>
<place-time>POST OFFICE DEPT. Novr 7. 1828</place-time>
<docbody>W. H. HUNT, P. M. Pensacola, Your letter of the 11" ult” is rec" *—The law of 1823 to which you refer, has not been repealed or in the least affected by subsequent

laws. It is entitled “an act to discontinue certain postroads and to establish others.” "
By the 19* Section of the post office law you will observe, all vessels are prohibited, under a certain penalty, from conveying letters on an established mail route, and by the law of 1823, all waters on which steam boats regularly ply are to be considered as established routes.”
If the provision of the 17* Sect. apply as well to coasting vessels, as to vessels from a foreign port, you at once see there is a conflict between this provision and that of the 19* Sect. The latter forbids the conveyance of letters on mail routes, except under a contract with the P. M. G. authorized by the 5. Sect., while the former authorizes it. In giving a construction to a statute, every part, if possible, should be so construed as to be carried into effect. The intent of the legislature is to be ascertained, by a liberal and fair construction of the words used throughout the statute. It would seem to be doing violence to the intention of Congress, to presume that they adopted conflicting provisions in the 17" and 19" Sections of the law under consideration, when the language of the 17* Section is susceptible of a fair construction, which avoids any conflict with the 19* Sect.
The language of the 17* Sect. although somewhat equivocal, would seem strongly to refer to vessels from a foreign port. On what other ground can have been the necessity of using the words, “within the U. States” in the second line. Had the provision been, “that no ship or vessel arriving at any port where a post office is established, it would have applied without doubt, as well to coasting vessels as vessels from a foreign port. But the provision is “that no ship or vessel arriving at any port” within the U. States shall be permitted &"—
The words “within the U. States” were not designed to be considered as surplusage or unmeaning, and when the provision of the 19* Sect.
is adverted to, there would seem to be no good ground to doubt, that the provision of the 17* Section was intended to apply to vessels from a foreign port, arriving at a port within the U. S. Any other construction of this Section destroys the provision of the 19* Sect. and authorizes vessels to convey letters on an established mail route, and on failing to deliver them, the commandants must be prosecuted under the 17th Sect. From the 18th Sec. the letters delivered under the provision of the 17* Sect. are clearly considered ship letters, and not such, on which, inland postage is to be charged.
By a liberal construction of the 5* Sec. all vessels which ply regularly on an established mail route, when conveying letters, are con-

sidered under an implied contract with the Dept, as post masters are instructed to received and pay for the conveyance of such letters.
If masters of vessels on a route convey letters and fail to deliver them, they may be proscecuted under the 19 Sect.
It would be preferable, however, to make contracts with the masters of vessels, as well those which regularly ply on mail routes" as others, by which they bind themselves to convey and deliver letters, and the P. M. G. to pay them, on delivery, either 2 or 3 cents for each letter.
You will observe in my letters to Phil" & N. York, that a charge of inland postage is to be made, for the distance letters are conveyed on an established route, but the voyage being continuous, inland postage can in no case be added to ship letter postage. Any distance of mail route will authorize the charge of 6% cents postage, which is the highest rate of ship postage.
Letters on which inland postage is charged when mailed at the office to which they are delivered, for some other office, to which they may be directed, should have no additional charge of postage, beyond what the length of the water and land route authorizes.
The letter of the 29" Oct 1825* to your predecessor on the above Subject was written, if I mistake not, by a gentleman in the office, and signed by me, without a full investigation of the Subject, which I was under the necessity of making, in my correspondence with the merchants of Phil"—I am not at all displeased at your vigilance and scrutiny on on this subject. An impression was made by your former letter, that you had used efforts with the P. M. at New Orleans, to induce him, to disregard the instructions of the Dept.
According to the above construction, there is no means by which the commanders of coasting Vessels can be found to deliver letters in the post office, which have been conveyed on waters, no part of which is established as a mail route. This would probably be the case with letters conveyed from Pensacola to Mobile. But, such places are few in the Union, and post masters have generally been able to make contracts with the commanders of Wessels, so as to avoid any loss to the public. It is my intention to present some modifications of this law to Congress at their next Session.
Persuasive and gentle means are generally found more efficacious, than harsher modes, for the enforcement of law or instructions; and I trust, that the small amount of business done at your office, will not cause greater difficulty than has been experienced, on the above subject, at the more important Seaports in the Union.

<docbody>SIR. Your communication of the 6" October last requiring me to furnish an estimate of the expence of this department for the first quarter of the ensuing year has been received *
The balance of the amount of the appropriation for removing the obstructions in the Appalachicola Say $1500 will be required perhaps before the commencement of the next quarter: But if the Government contemplate making or rather recommending a farther appropriation for removing obstructions, which possibly may exist in the Appalachicola River subsequent to the completion of the task I
have undertaken then I would respectfully recommend an appropriation of $10,000 for the removal of permanent (the existing ones being only casual with the exception of the river of sticks) obstructions to the navigation of said river, and a present removal of the casual obstructions to the navigation of the Chipola river, a tributary of the Appalachicola, and winding its course through a fertile and already tolerably populous country, all in the Territory of Florida.
If the Department will order me after my work on the appalachicola

is completed I will make a reconnaissance of the Chipola river and that part of the Chattahouchie which runs in the Territory of Florida and make an estimate of the expense of rendering those rivers completely navigable at all seasons of the year for Steam Boats. The above amount would go very far to accomplish this very desirable object, and I presume the Department are already so well informed of the immense trade that is bursting forth on these rivers; for a more general and detailed view of which, I refer you to our able delegate Col White, and to Mesr Berrian * & Wilde * Members from Georgia.”

SIR. Your communication of the 31* October last" was received by me on the Appalachicola River I have been returned from New Orleans for 12 days. previous to my departure, I had engaged a Mr Brown with 10 men and a good Keel Boat to make a commencement upon that part of the river alluded to in your letter, and on my return I found he had so far progressed as to make to have taken away about

at this place was before he commenced, entirely impeded, and the experiment of removing the island has so far succeeded as to widen the aperture and enable a Steam Boat to pass up with some difficulty:
a further excavation and finally an entire removal of this island will cause this part of the river to be as easily navigated as if there had never existed any obstruction. I have engaged 10 more hands from this place and proceed with them tomorrow to the spot, to drive on the work. I have purchased provisions blocks tackeles axees &ac chains &ac &ac at New Orleans and have them safe in store on the river to be used as occasion may require. If the water should rise of which I am apprehensive on account of the lateness of the season, I will be under the necessity of removing the men &ac farther up the river to the next grand obstruction, at the cut off, where they can work to as great advantage as if the water was low. I shall require another remittance next month; I have been so employed that I have not had time to make up the account of amts expended, but will do it when I return again from the Appalachicola I find that keel boats are more advantageous than flats would have been, and I therefore declined building them and have one large and one small keel boat, which I find more manageable in the swift currents I am very respectfully DAVID B MACOMB

[Enclosure:ALS]
Judge Webb to Delegate White KEY WEST 27 Oct. 1828
MY DEAR SIR, For the last two weeks, I have been a resident of this Island, & am highly gratified at the prospect it presents of health, comfort & convenience—no place has ever been more unfairly represented—so far from its being low & marshy (as I have often heard)
it is precisely the reverse, the Island is formed of a hard limestone rock, covered with a fine rich mould, from six to twelve inches in depth, & sufficiently elevated—it is thickly set with evergreen timber of various sorts & sizes, & beautifully variegated with flowering shrubs and vines, the harbor is excellent, the breezes fresh & apparently pure, & tipen the fish abundant & good—upon the whole I think it a pleasant healthy residence for at least nine months in the year.—
The town is handsomely situated, & contains at present, about six hundred souls, & will no doubt increase rapidly in size & commercial importance.— -
Situated as this place is, I think it should in some degree, command the attention of the Government—From its peculiar location, it may be made the key to the Commerce of the Gulf of Mexico, & should be regarded in that light—the causes which lead to so much fatality, when it was used as a Naval station, have wholly been removed, & nothing of that sort can now be apprehended.—
While at Washington last winter, I understood that a Company of troops would be stationed here, in the event of the establishment of a Court, should it be deemed necessary—As the population of this place, will always in a great degree, be composed of foreigners from various Governments, and as such persons are but little acquainted with our habits & customs, & usually form very erroneous
& imperfect ideas of liberty, as found in our Country, I can readily perceive that a military force may sometimes be necessary to sup-

port the Civil authority—many of these people are of the opinion, that as soon as they land on our shores, they are at liberty to do as they please, & it is difficult to learn them, except by punishments, that restraints can or ought to be imposed in a Country where the Citizens profess to be free—& to inflict these punishments it may frequently become necessary to resort to force."—
It is the opinion of all commercial men, (& in which I fully Coincide) that this port should be entitled to the priviledge of drawback, & should also be allowed to enter vessels & cargoes Coming from any part of the world; may I beg your attention in a particular manner to this Subject.—
The Sec: of the Navy, has authorized the Marshal to take possession of an Old building here formerly erected for a Hospital, fer to be used as a Court house; the ground upon which the building stands is private property, but the proprietors of the Island have agreed to make it over to the Gov" for any length of time for which it may be used as a court House, provided it shall be repaired in such a way as shall make it decent & respectable—it needs some repairs before it can be used, & I think the terms proposed by them, should be acceeded to, as it will can with much less expense, than will be required to build another, be made an excellent Court house—it will also be necessary to erect a Jail, as there is no house on the Island which can be used for that purpose.—
Let me hear from you at every Convenient opportunity, letters addressed to the Care of M. Hunt or the Naval agent at Pensacola will be forwarded to me, or they may be sent through the Commercial agent at Havanna.
Accept my D’Sir, renewed assurances of regard & esteem from Yr friend JAMES WEBB

afford to the establishment on Key West, and to the interests of the United States—
The position of Key West in a commercial point of view is peculiar—
its immediate vicinity to the Island of Cuba and the West Indies generally, its lying in the midst of the dangerous shoals and navigation to the Gulf of Mexico, the various accidents to which the commercial marine that resort to its vicinity is subjected, and the heterogenious congregation of individuals of all nations, most of whom unacquainted with our laws, and by habit respecting only Military force, together with the late infractions of the law of nations attempted by vessels of foreign nations, and piratical associations, all seem to offer very strong reasons for complying with the request of the authorities of Florida, that a Military post should be established on the Island of Key West—
I would therefore respectfully recommend, that a company of the Fourth Regiment of Infantry, now stationed in Florida, should be stationed at Key West, and that suitable arrangements be made during the present season for erecting quarters, stores, and even for a small fort or battery of four heavy guns—That the Proprietors of the Island grant to the U.S. a sufficiency of ground, to be held by the U.S. only so long as it may be used for Military purposes—

<place-time>GEN LAND OFFICE, Dec. 17. 1828.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, In reply to your letter of the 15th Inst.” Covering the Petition of a few of the Inhabitants of West Florida, asking for the establishment of a Land Office at Pensacola * & requesting my opinion of the expediency of establishing the same, I have to state that I

should consider the establishment of a Land Office at Pensacola as inexpedient because I do not believe that the annual receipts at an Office established there would exceed the expences of the Office.
The petitioners seem to have been misinformed on the Subject of the Laws in relation to Preemption rights. The Law requires that those claiming a preemption right shall establish such a right and pay for it previous to the public sale of the adjacent Lands—Whenever a number of townships are proclaimed for sale the Register & Receiver of the Land Office where they are to be sold, give public notice to all persons claiming preemptions within those Townships to come forward by the time fixed by Law, and establish and pay for the same. As there is a public sale of Lands to take place at Tallahassee in the month of January next, the Register and Receiver have I
presume given the usual notice to the claimants of preemption rights, and it is to that notice the petitioners refer.”

It would be well perhaps as a first step to imbody the charges that are, or that may be preferr'd under Specific heads, and take the testimony on each in order—and then furnish Col° Humphreys, with a copy of the charges and the evidence for his defence.

Your Compensation for this Service will be judged of by the Secretary of War, after your report is received, and made to conform to what is usual in such cases, or to the nature and extent of the trouble you may encounter in the execution of this trust. You will proceed, as soon after you receive this, as you can; and make your report with as little delay as possible, giving the agent a reasonable time to make his defence.

Commencement of the Fortifications, & the recent establishment of an Arsenal a short distance above Blakely, renders your recommendation in a Military point of view much more interesting—To this may be added the recent establishment of a line of Steam boats from Mobile to New Orleans, & the appropriations to improve the navigation—This latter consideration however is desirable on account of the general Convenience & accommodation a good Road would furnish to all who travel that way—I will take it as a favor if you will inform me whether it can be done without a special appropriation &
if not, will you recommend one to the Committee? Comeing under the weight & authority of yr recommendation there will be no difficulty—Has Capt Burch made the estimate & what Sum?"

<docbody>Pre-emption to certain Persons in Florida.
No. 9 20th Con. 2d. Sess.
Mr. Isacks. Made December 19. 1828.
The Committee on the Public Lands being instructed to inquire into the expediencey of granting the right of pre-emption to those persons in Florida, whose improvements were sold in 1825, and those included in the lands ceded to the Indians, and who would have been entitled to a pre-emption if the sale and cession had not been made before the passage of the pre-emption law of 1826
Report:
That by the act of 22d April, 1826,” the right of pre-emption to a quarter section of land was given to heads of families or persons over the age of 21 years, who, on or before the 1st day of January 1825, had actually inhabited and cultivated a tract of land in Florida, and had not removed therefrom, of which settlement, proof was required to be made to the Register and Receiver of the Land Offices. But in may 1825, and before the passage of the pre-emption law, a part of the public lands in Florida were sold by the United States; and it appears by a certificate of the Register and Receiver at Tallahassee, that eight persons had made settlements on the lands which were sold, who, under said pre-emption law, had the sale not been made, would have been entitled to a pre-emption in the land they occupied.
These persons in the opinion of the Committee, were equally entitled to the favor of the Government on account of these early settlements, with those who did not happen to live on the lands which had been sold before the privilege of pre-emption was recognized; and as the best amends which can now be made for the loss of their improvements and the lands they had selected, they ought to be allowed the privilege of entering an equal quantity of land, at the Government price, elsewhere.
The testimony on the other branch of the resolution shows that two persons, namely, Ellis Wood and Mary Downs were actually settlers, and would have been entitled to a pre-emption, but that the land on which they lived had been reserved to an Indian Chief, by the treaty of the 18th of September, 1823. That, by the act of 2d

February,” 1827, section 15, the right of pre-emption, elsewhere, is given to three persons who had made settlements on lands reserved to Indian Chiefs by the same treaty; and the Committee see no reason why these two persons should not have the same relief, and report a bill for that purpose.”

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24" October last," and have to reply.
1. The price demanded for the lot upon which the Custom House stands is $4000 (in fee simple.)
2. A suitable lot for the Custom House could not be obtained for a less price.
3. The materials of the present Custom House could not be advantageously used in erecting a new one, nor could they be sold to much advantage.
4. A building of stone could be put up which would answer for a Custom House and public store for $7,500.—
The present Custom House could be repaired and made perfectly suitable for $2000, and I would beg leave to recommend this course to the Department.

The lot offered to the Government is in my opinion well adapted to the use for which it is intended, and its price extremely reasonable.
I consider it worth $6000, and would recommend that the offer of the proprietors be closed with. I have forwarded to the Department a chart of the island of Key West which will shew the situation of the lot. There is a small Building upon the Custom House lot which might be disposed of to advantage, and which has been hitherto used for the boatmen, but as the streets now laid out will interfere with this house, I beg the Department will authorize its sale I should have furnished the Department with the information required at an earlier period, but the absence of one of the proprietors of the island made it impracticable to do so before the present moment.

GEN" Your letter of the 26th of October relative to the case of Mr Michilet, having with the protest of the Corporation of Pensacola
& other papers accompanying it,” been submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury," I am requested by him to inform you that the Selection of Mr Michilet of the nineteen acres of land designated on the old plat of the Town of Pensacola as reserved for the purpose of a “Navy Yard & watering place for Shipping” cannot be approved.
This decision is not influenced by an opinion that the piece of Land above referred to, is the property of the Corporation of Pensacola, on the contrary it is beleived the reservation was made for National, and not exclusively local objects, but it is given on the ground, that no Such liberal construction should be given to the Act of May last,” as would divest the public of a piece of property so long appropriated and because the fact of its having been so appropriated being immediately within the knowledge of the Committee who reported the Bill, it probably might have been one of the reasons which induced the limitation inserted in the Act as to the minimum quantity of land that might be located by the claimants.—
Mr Michilet's relinquishment is therefore returned to you, and as he will have to make a different selection it will be necessary for him to make another relinquishment and that heretofore made returned to him.
In giving instructions relative to the execution of the Act of 23"
May 1828, nothing was said on the Subject of the relinquishment that was to be filed with you, as provided for by the 2" Sect. of the Act, because the law seemed to have left that matter to the judgement &
discretion of the Register & Receiver, and because they were better acquainted with all those forms which the laws of the Territory required to give validity to Such an instrument, and it was beleived that they would take the same measures to Secure the rights of the Government as if those rights had been their own.—

The law requires that the relinquishment must be made by “all the parties in interest” that is of the parties who hold the interest in all the Lands relinquished. If the original grantee relinquish, he should show by satisfactory evidence from each Office in which a conveyance of the Land might be admitted to record, that no Such conveyance was of record, & if necessary he should be required to make oath that he was the only party in interest of the Land relinquished.
If the heir, devisee or assignee of the Original grantee make a relinquishment, he should in addition to the above requisites exhibit a regular & well authenticated Chain of title, from the original grantee, to the Lands relinquished. I think it would be proper to have the relinquishment recorded & the originals or authenticated copies filed in the Office of the Register *

<docbody>MY DEAR SIR I returned here a few days since, having examined, as directed,” the inland passage between the S" Marys & S. Johns—
I find that the principal obstruction at the Amelia narrows may be easily obviated by a short canal from a branch of Belle river to Amelia sound—The distance by this operation will be shortened nearly 3
miles, and the canal may be dug at an expence not exceeding the estimate for removing the obstacles in the narrows—I have received and shall acceede to proposals from a responsible & competent Individual to execute the whole work agreeably to my advertisement for
13.500 dollars—
From an estimate made by me I inclined to the opinion that hired labor under government superintendents, with all the expences necessary as the preparations of boats, accommodations &c. &c. &c would bring up the cost to an amount greatly exceeding that Sum—
You may safely calculate that the work contemplated will now be performed for the estimate & provision only for the contingencies will have to be made—They cannot possibly exceed 1500 dollars & I
mention this fact to you in time to bring the subject before Congress;
or to embrace it within the contingent expenses of your Department for the year 1829–The principal item will be for my compensation, which will vary of course according to the time consumed in executing the work—
I have received from the Treasury Dep a draft of 500 dollars, but will thank you for a further remittance of 1000 dollars which will enable me to progress with the work for many months—

as the orders for a detail from the Garrison here, leave it at the discretion of the Commanding Officer what number he can spare, as never more than eight seven at a time were furnished under these orders;
after but two or three, and none after the order for the trial of L." Brown arrived; the work has from that time been entirely suspended—I
would however remark that as this causeway cannot be used when finished, until the contemplated Bridge has been built, that little or no injury will result from the present suspension of the work; but that when resumed it will be important that there should be orders specifying the precise number of men that the Garrison shall furnish.
(say one Serjeant and fifteen men) who when once detailed shall in no case be changed until the work is finished, except at the request of the q Master, or for sickness, or crime, in which cases others shall be immediately detailed to supply their places—
With respect to the Bridge over the S" Sebastians, proposals for the building of which by Contract have been issued by L" Brown, and a

copy of which is herewith inclosed,” I would remark, that should he fail in obtaining a reasonable Contract here, yet if the Advertisement be published in any part of the Middle or Eastern States, describing the width of the river to be about 310 feet its depth at high water averaging about 14 feet, that its scite is within half a mile of S"
Augustine, and that the Stehe and Timber may all be obtained within eighteen miles & the Stone within three miles with very little land carriage, I have no doubt but that a Contractor with a gang of hands would arrive and complete the work in less time than it could be done in any other way—
As to the road from Tamoka to New Smyrna, it appears to be the general opinion here, that it can be of no service, and will be seldom if ever used, as it will run through a barrern and often inundated country, and as there is a navigable river in almost a straight line between the two settlements—If this be the case, and the road should not be constantly used, it will soon be grown up & obliterated, at whatever expence it may be made, reasoning from the road constructed a few years ago by Cap" Burch from this place to Talahassee, which from want of use in some places near here, is now hardly to be discerned—
Very respectfully I am Sir Your Obt Serv"
G. BENDER Major & Q M"
BRIG. GEN JESUP Q Mast Gen" Washington City P.S. A Court was organized on the 3" instant for the trial of L* Brown,” by the admission of L." Burke * in the place of Major Payne, L' Brown not making the objections to him that were expected; but we have not been able to make any progress for the want of L' Anderson & all other witnesses for the prosecution—As L"
Brown is now however under arrest, Major Gates" has ordered the act" ass" Commissary to do his duties as far as regards the supplies for the Garrison—

the moderate sum of $3,000 he hopes will be considered well expended for such objects—
In relation to the other the Report of the officers are conclusive that the U States are subject to a heavy expence for the want of

<docbody>FOR. BREVET, COLON" G. M. BROOKE. Comm" Cantonement Brooke SIR: The Government of the U.S. has been greatly importuned by the Authorities of Florida and especially by the delegate in Congress,"
as well as by the National Authorities on Key West,” to cause to be established on that Island a Military Post, to protect the place from lawless adventurers and to enable the magistracy and the Courts to carry into effect the laws and decrees.—The Government is disposed to acceed to their wishes, but before taking any measures of a character to give permanency to the object; it is desirable to ascertain from the proprietors, who are much interested in having the troops stationed at Key West, whether they are willing to release to the United States a suitable site, for the erection of Quarters and a Battery—You will therefore proceed to Key West by the earliest opportunity, or send an Officer, who, may in your opinion be competent to the duty, for the purpose of consulting with the Authorities at that place, as to the precise views, which they have in asking for a Military force, the position most proper for the establishment of the troops, and works, if necessary together with the quantity of land that may be necessary for said purposes, and to obtain from the proprietors the release of the ground during the continuance of the troops at Key West, or for so long a period as the said land shall be occupied for Military purposes—
It is expected that the proprietors will make this session without expense to the U. S. Having made these preliminary arrangements, you or the officer sent by you, will examine the nature of the soil, * A memorandum of these sums is present.

whether materials are to be had on the Island for erecting the quarters, fort or battery: if lime and shells are to be had suitable for making tapia buildings, or shell-stone that may be employed for that purpose:
whether the position to be selected is a healthy one and if not whether it is susceptible of being made so by removing the bushes, drawing the stagnant water and letting in the salt water from the Sea,—You will also cause to be enquired into all the facts concerning the former Naval establishment, why it was so unhealthy; if there was a want of police on the Island at the time, or if it is insuperable from circumstances beyond contol—In fine, to make yourself acquainted with every circumstance and fact relating to the place—as to its Military advantages, commercial, agricultural, fishing, wrecking, and indeed every description of advantage, including Naval purposes, and also all the disadvantages under every point of veiw, especially as to it Military occupancy—Should the War Department decide upon placing a force there, it is probable that it will be made a dependency of Tampa Bay establishment, and consequently one company from that place, or from the 4th Regt, will be ordered to Key West, so that it may be reinforced should it be found necessary, and also releived at stated times should it be judged proper to consider it rather as an out post than a permanent garrison—It would be as well perhaps, to take the Surgeon of the post under your command, with you, if you go, yourself to the Key, if not, to send him with the Officer that you may select to perform the duties herein directed."
I have the honor to be Sir Your Most. Obt. Servt.

<place-time>[January 10, 1829]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate & House of Representatives of the United States.
The memorial of sundry inhabitants of the town of Key West, would most respectfully represent: that from the increased number of inhabitants and business of the Island, the establishment of a mail between this place and the main, would be of the first importance to them, and it is believed it would be mutually beneficial, particularly to persons engaged in commerce throughout the United States

Your memorialists believe that the advantages of a Mail from this place, would be important to the Government in a political point of View, as frequent and certain communication could then be held with the West India Squadron] and th[MS. torn "] officers upon the Island, which at this time is precarious and frequently delayed a long time after it should have been received.
It is believed a Mail route could be established between this place and Charleston, to depart twice a month at an expense not exceeding Two thousand dollars as there are already vessels regularly running between the two places and there is no doubt the owners would make a contract upon the most liberal terms, and your memorialists with great confidence assert, that the amount of Postage received would be sufficient to defray the expense of the route. The communication between this place and Havanna is almost invariably effected in one night, the distance being about seventy miles, and vessels are regularly coming from thence, about twice or three times a week;
if a Mail route was established from here there can be no doubt, the merchants of Havana, [MS. torn "] avail themselves of it, in their communications with the United States, and immense and important advantages would result to the commercial community, from the facility and certainty with which information could be obtained from this important Island.
Your Memorialists therefore most respectfully pray, that you will afford them all the aid in your power, in the establishment of a Mail Route between this place and the city of Charleston South Carolina, or such other place as you may deem most advantageous.

<docbody>HONBe JOs M. WHITE
DEAR SIR, By a resolution of the last Legislative Council, a resolution, passed at a previous session for my benefit,” is refered to you, and through you to Congress; That you may understand something more of the merits of the claim than you can do, from the resolutions themselves, I beg leave to present for your consideration a few observations.
The resolutions refered to, you have seen—you will recollect also, that the first Act of Congress granted for a “Seminary &c two entire townships," to be located under the directions of the Secretary of the Treasury, one in the Western, and the other in the Eastern land District.—The selection of these townships was referd to Gov. Duval, by Mr Rush in the fall of 1825.”—The Gov. being desireous that the selections should be made at an early time, and to the greatest advantage—Urged Maj Lewis * and myself to undertake it, supposeing from our observation and experience in these matters—our Knowledge of the situation of the fine lands &c, that we could do more justice to the Territory than any other persons here—After much hesitation on our part, and after being much importuned, I verry reluctantly undertook the locations, and immediately proceeded to the business—
In the winter of 1825-6 Lewis & myself proceeded to the Chippola Country, where we remained six weeks industriously employed in traversing that Country, a labour of the most arduous and unpleasant description.—This examination resulted in the selection of a Township, which is admitted by all, to embrace a greater proportion of fine lands, than any other in that section of Country;—By acting promptly I was enabled to select this township, before the Township granted to the Deaf & Dumb asylum was located, which prevented the Agents going into to it for any share of his township.—The preemption law extracted a large portion of the Township refered to.
Subsequently you procured the passage of a law, authoriseing the location of the remaining Township and the quantity extracted by preemption claims from the first, to be made in sections.”—The

Country was extensive and but little known, being entirely unsettled, except in those parts, where preemption claims covered the good lands, or at least left vacant but few tracts of a section in a Square form, that could be esteemed valuable or of good quality—These circumstances, could not have been anticipated by me, but they added greatly to the labour, and to the expenses of the undertakeing. I was aware that the trust was a responsible one, and now I discovered, the expenses & labour would greatly exceed what I had at first supposed;
and that my only reward would probably be, the ill will, & sometimes abuse, of persons, who wished to purchase lands, which I thought it my duty to select, beside seriously affecting my interest in other respects—Often have I repented most, heartily the engagement, but was urged to continue.—I have frequently gone, with a party of hands employed & paid by myself—with pack horses provissions and camp equipments, prepared to remain several weeks, for the purpose of makeing selections for the seminary, my expenses were necessarily verry considerable.—I can at any time, convince any impartial mind that I will be greatly looser by the business, if the two sections are secured to me, as contemplated by the first resolutions to convince you of the correctness of this statement, it will be sufficient to remark, that many tracts have been selected & reserved by me, which I could have purchased without competition, and sold again, almost immediately at from four to six dollars per acre, many instances have occurred in which it would have been attended with no difficulty.
Your Knowledge of this Country, and the seattered dispersed manner in which the fine lands are scattered over its face, the labour and dificulty attending a close & minute examination, so as to obtain the best lands will enable you to appreciate my services.
I believe that it is conceded by every one, that the lands reserved are the verry best that could have been obtained and that probably no other person in the country, could have done the Territory more justice. Nor is it objected, that the two sections is an extravegant allowance, but the Idea is, that the land itself ought not to be appropriated in this manner, and that the government of the U. States ought to pay all expenses of location, because, the law directs, that the locations shall be made under the directions of the Sect” of the Treasury. I cannot believe however, that Congress can be persuaded, that the Gov" are is properly chargeable with such expenses.—It appears to me that the expense of selecting &c, is justly and fairly chargeable against the land itself.—The Govt. granted for a specific object, two townships of land, to be “located” &c, upon any lands not otherwise appropriated &c, Now, until these lands are selected in persueance of the act, the grant is not complete, it no where attaches, 

it is not available. To perfect the grant, an after act is necessary, the performance of which will be attended with necessary & unavoidable expenses. There is no provission by the grantee for the payment of such expenses, certainly under such circumstances the property when granted obtained should be charged therewith. All the states which have received similar grants, have paid for locating &c. The case is simply this, a verry laborious, troublesome and expensive service has been performed, to the entire satisfaction of those, who held the supervision and direction thereof, and of all others, who have taken the trouble to examine for themselves. Indeed none have complained.
These services were expended performed and these expenses incurred, to perfect or render complete, that which was before imperfect &
incomplete, by them, it is admitted, that it has been done, in an advantageous & satisfactory manner—What then, is more equitable
& just, than that the same grant should be charged with all necessary expenses, and a fair compensation for services, by which it has been greatly increased in value—And what could be more unjust, than to detain from me a just & equitable allowance for services, and a restoration of moneys necessarily expended in the performance of that service.—I put it to your unbiased judgement, whether, upon every principle of justice I have not a right to demand of the grant, or property itself, such compensation—Then as to the reasonableness of the allowance made in the first resolution. I will remark, that none of the members thought the allowance too great, several of them have informed me, that they would give me a statement to that effect and that they were fully convinced that the two sections would be quite moderate enough.—Their value has been greatly exagerated in a piece signed Junius, which I suppose you have seen—I would say the value as he gives it, is at least double that which could be obtained in any reasonable time if ever. Maj. Adair * has been here and witnessed the progress of this business—And to him I beg leave to refer you for the correctness of matters of fact stated above. Should you concur in the view of the matter taken above, I hope you will interest yourself for me, and obtain the Act of Congress contemplated by the first resolution. I hope you will excuse this, it was written in much haste—Maj. Adair can tell all the news &C."
With much respect y' ob' sev"

<dochead>PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF MAGNOLIA</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[January 12, 1829]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, The Petition of the Undersigned Merchants, and Citizens of the Town of Magnolia, Territory of Florida, respectfully Sheweth: That your Memorialists having noticed the introduction of a Bill before your honorable body for the establishment of a Port of Entry at Fort St Marks," and desirous that, -for the common benefit of the Country, and in consequence of advantages which your Memorialists humbly conceive Magnolia to afford, for such an object,—it may be located here; beg leave to present the following facts:—
Magnolia is situated at the head of navigation upon the river St Marks,—nine & an half miles, in a direct line, and fourteen by the course of the river, from the Gulph of Mexico: and five and an half miles N. N. E. from Fort St Marks. The Appalachee Bay, at a point called “Spanish hole” (five miles below Fort St Marks and Thirteen, by water, from Magnolia) affords a good harbour from all winds and safe anchorage for vessels drawing fourteen feet of Water—where they may safely discharge or take on board Cargoes, by means of lighters, which are kept at Magnolia for that purpose. Between “Spanish hole” and Fort St Marks, the navigation is obstructed by Oysterbeds, so that vessels, drawing more than Eight feet, cannot ascend the river to that place, in ordinary tides, without lightening. The same draught of water may also be brought up, in ordinary tides, to Magnolia. With spring tides (that is, tides which occur upon the full and change of the moon,) Eight and an half to Nine feet may be found up to St Marks, and, under the same circumstances, nearly the same depth to the town of Magnolia. By reference to an official Certificate of the Surveyor of the Port of St Marks (accompanying this memorial)*—to which your Memorialists respectfully invite your attention, it will be seen that, since the establishment of the town of Magnolia, and several commodious warehouses therein, the greater part of the Shipping arriving at the Port of St Marks finds its way to the former, notwithstanding the location of the Surveyor

and his office at the latter. Of 1422 Tons shipping that arrived at Fort St Marks from June to December (1828) inclusive (after having deducted from the amount of tonnage entered, the sum of 105, the burthen of a Brig which unloaded below St Marks, and whose Cargo—
was transported in lighters above Magnolia to Rock Haven,) it appears that 1052 Tons passed up to Magnolia, while 370 remained at St Marks. A part of that number consisted of transient vessels, touching on the way to other ports in the Gulph. Upon the establishment of the City of Tallahassee it became necessary for the Merchants and Traders of that place to fix upon some point, accessible to shipping, as a general depôt. St Marks was, then, the only place known to them as affording the immediate facilities they required.
Since the settlement of Magnolia, -within a period of Eighteen Months, the Merchants and Traders of Tallahassee, or those of them, at least, not having Storehouses at St Marks, have found it advisable to receive their goods, for homeward transportation, at Magnolia, and also to send articles of produce collected in the course of their business to the same place for shipment. As a prominent advantage to justify such a preference, it might be mentioned that the distance from Tallahassee to St Marks is 23 Miles, while to Magnolia it is seventeen, -creating a difference of some importance in the expense of land transportation, and that the road leading from St Marks to Tallahassee (or several miles of it near St Marks where it is overflown by the tides) always bad, is, at times, almost impassable by loaded teams; while that from Magnolia to Tallahassee, being upon more elevated ground & beyond the reach of tide water, has been usually good, and is better capable of improvement at but little expense.
An evidence of the advantage of transporting goods, destined for the interior, from some point higher up the river than St Marks, may be found in the fact that two vessels within the last six months, having goods for the interior, have discharged their Cargoes below S*Marks into Lighters, for the purpose of having them carried to Rock Haven, Seven Miles above Magnolia, beyond which there is a Boat navigation only.—Besides many local advantages, Magnolia is the nearest point, enjoying like facilities of navigation and trade, to an extensive &
fertile region of Country, lying in a North East direction and bordering upon the Mikasukie Lake: A section of Country which sends already the whole of its production of Sea Island & Upland Cotton to this place for shipment: and is believed that from Two to Three Thousand Bales will be shipped hence during the present Season. But the most important staple of that and other portions of this Territory will be found to consist in the article of Sugar, for which the planters throughout Middle Florida are known to be preparing to grow upon a great scale. Sugar is an article that must find its way to the nearest

navigable water. That place for Nine Tenths of the land adapted to the culture of the cane in Middle Florida is Magnolia.
Your Memorialists will further state that Magnolia, at this time, contains a population of 300 Souls, and has Twelve Mercantile Houses, engaged in extensive business in the sale of goods and the purchase and shipment of the products of the Country: a number not inferior to that of any other Sea port within the Territory.
The Town of Magnolia owns seven sail of vessels, measuring Five hundred Tons; and it is worthy of remark that but one other vessel is owned within the Apalachicola District—a Sloop of about 35 Tons, half of which is owned at Apalachicola, the other half at Tallahassee.
Fort St Marks contains Twenty Inhabitants, including Fishermen
& Pilots. The place is deemed so unhealthy that, of the few residing there, several are making arrangements to remove: and it is usually almost deserted during the summer months. Should your honorable Body deem it advisable to establish a Custom House at that place, the Officer charged with its duties must necessarily reside at Magnolia a part of the Year.
The Location of Magnolia is such as to warrant the belief that it will continue healthy:—situated upon a pine bearing soil, of sufficient elevation, and supplied with wholesome water.
Your Memorialists deem it the most eligible and central point for the meeting of the great agricultural and shipping interests; and confidently trust that your honorable Body will deem it advisable, should a Custom House be established upon the river, to direct that its location be at Magnolia.
And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray MAGNOLIA 12 January 1829

<docbody>DEAR COLO I send you herewith the opinion of Judge Brackenridge in the cases of Robinson & Gregory " presenting the long litigated questions as to the right of the settler to take his preemption in two eights instead of an entire quarter & of two settlers on the same quarter to take each an adjoining quarter so as to secure his improvement. Owing to a doubt in the minds of some of the Court as to their power to issue a mandamus cases were postponed to next Court.
In regard to the first question not a doubt was entertained by the Court it was considered clear & unquestionable, as to the second there seemed to be a division, Judge Smith not having made a settled opinion & Judge Randall refusing to consider it because of his opinion as to the powers of the Court. In any event however there could be but a division of the judges thus Judge Woodward & Brackenridge in favor of the applicant Judge Smith (supposing his opinion made up)
& Judge Randall against it."
To the settlers it is most important that this question should be determined the one way or the other, many of them are desirousto sell & all are anxious to have their patents. There is only one applicant for the benefit of the 3/8" law who is Colo Robinson there are about 50 claiming the right to enter in 8" So is it not better for the Gov' to terminate a controversy of such little interest by giving up the point or if not submit the matter to the Atto. Gen' to be decided by him. It is however submitted to your discretion to take the best means of effecting our wishes.
There is another subject to which I would ask your attention.
There are some cases of preemption claims above Ellicotts line &

the General land Office refused to grant patents. You are desired to procure some law on the subject. There are some cases too of citizens of Georgia interested. I cannot write you on account of weakness from a late attack. Important political changes are going on greatly in our favor There is treason in the camp & they are suffering I think from divison results will shew.

<docbody>THOS. LM"KENNEY Esq Genl. Supt. of Indian Affairs SIR A large party of Indians are now with me on buisness Holata Emathla one of the chiefs named in G. Humphereys letter of Octor
20* 1828,” and which has been laid before congress—says that the few chiefs present did assent on their part to send out some of their people to look at this new country spoken of by the agent. He also states that the great majority of the chiefs have not been consulted and that the nation is not apprisd of the matter, It is my opinion that we shall have much more difficulty than the Department, could anticipate from the Agents letter, and I am decidedly of opinion if a party of the chiefs are invited to Washington, and I can meet them many difficulties will be surmounted "-The chiefs request that their annuity for the present year may be remitted as early as possible, and my advice is that they be paid here, when I can explain to them any objects & inforce the views of the Government on such subjects as you may deem necessary & proper, If a deputation of the chiefs should be allowed in that case they will take their departure from this to the City I am Respectfully Your ob" sevt Wm P. DUVAL

[Endorsed] Ind: Office (Tallahassee) 28"Jan 1829–W" P. Duval—
Relative to the disposition of the Indians to remove from Florida—
proposes that a deputation be invited to Washington—Much anxiety has existed in Florida to rid the Territory of the Indians within it. The condition of the Indians would seem, apart from all the wishes & sufferings of the Citizens by their means, alone, to demand that all measures likely to effect the object of removal be adopted. For myself I have never doubted the readiness of the Seminoles to leave Florida. The Gov" in its negotiations on the subject, has been met always by obstacles. I believe if five of the principle Chiefs were invited on here, the work might be done. The efforts & expenditures of the past authorize this movement, & the Citizens of Florida press it—whilst the abject & suffering condition of the Indians appear to demand it. I Respectfully recommend it.

My communication's to the proper department upon the subject of examining witnesses in Havanna have gone safe to hand as I am informed by you, and no notice has been taken of them *—I certainly have done my duty, and I wish it expressly understood by the department that I do not consider it my duty to move in the Havanna examination, unless especially authorized to do so. —The Law Agent, * See post, p. 151.

now in Kentucky, is the officer, duly appointed and Commissioned, to take testimony in these cases, and by law I am not legitimately called upon, to attend to any matter in person beyond the limits of this Territory at least.—I have however offered my Services to attend in Havanna, & if they are called in requisition, they will be most freely and undustriously loaned to the interests of my government.—I have no hesitation in saying, that Colon Mitchel et alia; residing in Havanna, deeply interested in this case, can procure what they please, to sustain their claims—
My whole time is devoted to this claim, and as far as my humble efforts and abilities will be, they will be arduously employed in defeating this claim.—If the commission is open, by either party at this late period, I am decidedly of an opinion, the Case cannot be argued at the approaching term—

<docbody>SIR In obedience to your instructions after giving due notice to the parties concerned we proceeded to examine the contested preemption cases referred to us for further consideration. No evidence was produced against any other claim than that of Peter W. Guatier Senior, N° 99 and in the absence of further testimony we have no reason to alter the decision before given in those cases. The evidence produced on this occasion against the claim of P. W. Guatier, Sen"
fully sustains the opinion heretofore given by the Register & Receiver, that the claimant continued to be a citizen of the State of Georgia until long after the passage of the Act granting preemptions. He came to Florida in 1822 And located his negroes on the Land which he claims, he improved a large plantation which he has continued to

cultivate ever since. He visited this plantation frequently and sometimes remained two or three weeks. It was never his permanent residence until after the passage of the Act under which he claims it cannot therefore be said that he “actually inhabited & cultivated” this land prior to the 1" day of January 1825, there were few settlers in that Section of Country whose cultivation was so extensive as that of the claimant. If the equity of the Claim can be considered we are of the opinion that it should be confirmed. How far we are authorized to depart from the Strict letter of the Law, and decide on equitable rights is a matter of some doubt, and we therefore refer it to the department to determine if the claim shall be allowed or not—
The cases arising under the mandamus of Judge Woodward were brought before the Court of Appeals at the last term, but the Court entertaining a doubt on the subject of jurisdiction has postponed its decision until the next session when we entertain no doubt the decision of Judge Woodward will be reversed.”

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF THE MIDDLE DISTRICT</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[Referred February 16, 1829]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.
The memorial of the undersigned, inhabitants of the Middle District of the Territory of Florida, respectfully represent, that your memorialists, identified with the interest and prosperity of this section of Country, have heard, with the deepest concern and regret, that a Port of Entry is to be established at Magnolia, on the river S*Marks.”
Your memorialists hope, they may not be considered officious or disrespectful, when they endeavour to shew, the inconvenience and injury which must result from the adoption of this measure, and while they demonstrate the superior advantages of St: Marks, as the commercial depot of Middle Florida, this demonstration will be the more easily effected, by a reference to the map, herewith presented,” and to which your memorialists beg leave to call your attention. Situated at the confluence of the rivers S*Marks and Wakulla, with an open exposure to the gulf, from which it is not more than ten miles distant, S*Marksisequally accessable byland and by sea. It is the highest point to which, vessels drawing more than eight feet water, can be navigated, and from thence, to all the rich settlements of the interior, highways have been, or may be constructed.
By the removal of a few obstructions, which may be accomplished with little labor and expense, the river St: Marks would afford a safe and convenient navigation, from the ocean to the village of S’ Marks, for vessels, drawing ten feet water. At present, all vessels of a greater draft than eight feet, are compelled to anchor in the bay, at a distance of eight miles from S' Marks, from whence, their cargoes are transported in lighters or small boats, to the warehouses at S*Marks. The expense, delay and inconvenience, attendant on this mode of transporting the articles of import and export of this country, is already sufficiently embarrassing, but how greatly must that embarrasment be augmented, when the port of entry shall have been established at Magnolia, a distance of eight miles farther in the interior, than S*
Marks? and which is approached by a contracted, rapid and serpentine stream, presenting Continued difficuly and delay to the enterprising mariner? Wessels drawing more than six feet, cannot in the ordinary stages of the river, ascend to Magnolia, and from this point, to its confluence with the Wakulla, the river is confined within such

narrow limits, that none but vessels of the very smallest class, are enabled when they have arrived at their place of destiny, to turn about, for the purpose of descending, and are most frequently compelled to drop down the stream, stern foremost, until they arrive near S Marks. When the difficulty and delay, attendant on the ascending and descending the river, to and from Magnolia, is considered, it must be evident, that every article delivered at that place, must be charged with an additional expense to the importer and consumer, as the freight of every vessel will be regulated, by the time necessary for the completion of her voyage, and the obstacles which are presented to its accomplishment. The inconvenience and impropriety of placing the custom House and the revenue Officers at a distance so remote from the sea board, must be manifest, to every observer. It exposes the mariner to unnecessary trouble and delay, it exposes the merchant to hazard, and it exposes the revenue to loss and depredations, affording facilities to smuggling.
The security of the Revenue, and the advancement of Commerce, mutually demand, that the Custom House should be established at that point, where communications by land and sea are most easily accomplished; and your memorialists hazard nothing in the assertion, that there is no position, between the Apalachicola and the Suwannee rivers, a distance of more than two Hundred miles, so well calculated for commercial purposes, as the port of S’ Marks.
Your memorialists would further, most respectfully suggest, that their interest as well as that of the United States, would be materially advanced, by causing the public land, within and adjacent to the Fortress of S* Marks, to be laid out in Town lots, and Exposed to sale at public auction.” Your memorialists are aware, that an objection may be urged to this measure, in consequence of this property being situated within the limits of the grant to Forbes & Co., but as neither the Government of Spain, from which this grant, if any, eminated, or the Government of the United States, have sanctioned or confirmed a grant to individuals for the public domain, within the limits of a Fortress, or within One Hundred feet from its wall on the Exterior (and in most instances, not within one mile from a Fortress), your memorialists believe, there would be little hazard, in thus far disposing of the public property.
If it should be said, that this fortress may be required for the future defence of the Country, your memorialists would reply, that the fort, and its appendages, are already in a state of ruin and dilapidation, and if it were in complete repair, it would be inadequate to the end

proposed. From, its structure, it must have been originally designed, as a defence alone against Indian assaults, and must, at all times, have yielded to the attack of those Experienced in civilized warfare.
Even the position, is no longer important for military purposes, as the settlements have already extended in advance of it on the Western margin of the bay, and an invading enemy, might land at the entrance of the harbour, and penetrate the interior of the Country, without receiving the smallest annoyance from the Garrison of S*
Marks. If it be the intention of the Government, as we hope it is, to give protection to this portion of our sea board, it will be necessary to assume and fortify a position, at or near the entrance of the bay. Wherefore, your memorialists pray, that the public ground, within the Fortress of St Marks, and from One Hundred feet from its wall on the Exterior, be laid out in Town lots, and exposed to sale at public auction.
And your memorialists further pray, that the port of entry, about to be established at Magnolia, be abolished, and that it be removed to, and established at S*Marks, and your memorialists will ever pray R.

SIR, I submit two communications from the District Attorney of Middle Florida,” which were heretofore submitted to the Executive but not having been acted upon it would seem to be important that some immediate measures should be taken on the subject. And I
would take the liberty of suggesting the propriety of the employment of assistant Counsel in the cases of Forbes and Arredondo, with authority issuing from the Dept. of State, to go to the Havanna, and require that the originals of all papers in relation to lands granted by the Spanish Authorities in Florida should be given up, and in particular such papers as related to the land claimed by Forbes &
C° and Arredondo.—
The Counsel thus employed should also be instructed to take all proper and necessary measures to counteract those which the claimants are represented to have taken at Havanna for the purpose of establishing their claims.
The papers herewith enclosed and marked from no 1 to no 4.
show the measures which have heretofore been taken by the President in relation to the appointment of assistant Counsel, under the provision of the 11th Sect. of the Act approved the 23" May 1828,” by which it will appear that the duties of that Officer does not extend to the two cases above mentioned."

What attention was paid to this memorial I am uninformed, but believing that the Land Department is vested with ample power to carry this plan into execution, if approved, and knowing the deep interest which is felt on this Subject by the People of Florida, I am induced to present it to your consideration. S"
Marks is the commercial Depot of Middle Florida. The imports and exports to and from this point are already considerable, and are increasing with great rapidity. The right to this property yet remaining in the Government individuals are prevented from making the improvements necessary for the conveniences of commerce. If a few acres of land was laid of in Town lots and exposed to market at the approaching land Sales, they would bring a considerable Sum of money, and would contribute greatly to the convenience and prosperity of our Country. Allow me to Solicit your attention to this interesting Subject.

<docbody>TO THE HON: SECY OF WAR. Washington City.
SIR. The undersigned inhabitants of the County of Alachua, having heard that strong efforts are making to prejudice the Government of the U. S. against its Agent for Indian affairs in this territory.
Col. G. Humphreys, & as we beleive with a view to effect his removal from office, in order that Some interested aspirant may be benefitted thereby & not with a Single eye to the public good—the only motive which the undersigned conceive could justify an attempt like that thder under consideration against a public officer—beg leave to state that an acquaintance of many years with Col Humphreys during the time he has been in the discharge of the duties as Indian Agent, has enabled us to form a correct estimate of the principles which have governed him in the discharge of those duties; Some of us have narrowly Scrutinized his conduct in relation to our Indian affairs

intercourse because we had heard his policy condemned & his motives aspersed & we find it incumbent upon us to say after Such scrutiny;
that however we may have been at times disposed to eensttre censure his proceedings, are nevertheless Satisfied his course has been correct
& his policy in the management of our Indian relations judicious, and based upon justice. & having a tendency to place their relations upon a footing of permanent friendship: Under these circumstances we cannot, but anticipate his removal his—Pemeval as an evil to be deprecated & therefore beg leave respectfully to request that it may not take place. We have good reason to beleive that if the Services of Col: Humphreys in his present capacity are continued, the final emigration of the Seminole Indians out of Our Territory (an event so much to be desired by the Inhabitants of this County, most of whom reside in the immediate vicinity of the Indians) may in a short time be effected. We know that his influence with the the Indians has been already. to a considerable extent successfully exercised upon that Subject & it is confidently Supposed by us, that if Suitable encouragement is given to his effort, they will eventually lead to a perfect accomplishment of this all important object. The undersigned donot intend to place themselves in the light of champions to Col. Humphreys & must not be so considered, as we are actuated in making this communication solely with a desire to further the cause of Justice & premate promote the public good.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10" Ulto," by last mail, and in connection therewith have received the Treasurers draft for the amount apecified.
You inform me that my accounts still remain in your Office, waiting the transmission of the work upon which the payments have been made—I am aware of this circumstance and regret most sincerely that the reiterated orders from the Department for the Surveys of the private claims West, have rendered this delay indispensibly necessary, of which I informed you" when I received your last letter of instructions on that Subject.” To have made out and transmitted the work before the Surveys were closed, would have subjected this office the second time to the formation of a large portion of it, which I never for one moment apprehended was the wish of the Department; more particularly as I informed you that the third Survey would prevent me from reporting the previous work until a final return should be received in the Office—this is about to be effected in a few days and you shall be put in possession of the entire work as Soon as practicable.
On the Subject of examinations of Surveys in comparision with the field notes before payments are made, such has been the uniform practice of this Office heretofore and they Shall meet with a more critical examination hereafter.

The Surveyor who executed the work refered to in the diagram, enclosed in yours of the 20" January Ulto." is now here, and will be dispatched for the Correction of said work as soon as he completes the return of his late Surveys.
I have the honor to be very respectfully Your Mo. Ob*S*

DEAR SIR: You will probably remember to have been informed by his Excellency the Governor of Florida, that at his instance, I had been induced to undertake the location of two Townships of land granted by Congress for a Seminary of learning in the Teritory of Florida." There yet remains about fifteen sections to be selected, a few of which I feel it my duty to locate upon some small Islands, lying East of the entrance of the Suwannee River which have not been surveyed. The Islands are small, & cannot become valueable except for Temporary residences and fisheries; but good lands are scarce, and I do not believe selections can be made of more value to the Teritory than those Islands may prove. They are unclaimed and it will be impossible in some instance to connect the Islands with the main land in the survey, as they are not in view. I am determined, because I think it my duty, to select to the amount of one two or perhaps three sections on those Islands I wish therefore to be informed whether locations by special calls in such case will be allowed. I

<docbody>GEORGE GRAHAM Esquire Commr Gen' Land Office SIR I observe that an appropriation has been made to defray the expense of surveying the private land claims in Florida * & I beg leave to suggest that it is of importance both to the Goverment and to the claimants that the surveys should be made as soon as possible great difficulties exist with respect to claims the boundaries of which are undefined & particularly with the donation claims which are generally for 640 acres each some of the claimants wish to cut off the valuable timber others to build and make improvements on their claims but do not know where to begin or by what rule the Surveys are to be governed, a man for instance (& such or similar cases are not rare)
has a donation for 640 acres his improvement is at the end of a narrow but good hammock of live oak now must he take his 640 acres in a square with his improvement in the center or may he make it of what width he pleases & run up the hammock for quantity I think he should take it in a square, but they are not generally satisfied to do that, but adopt the latter principle and some of our County Surveyors when called to survey these tracts make it a point to run the lines in that manner which will best suit the interest of the claimant regardless of that of the goverment, this is certainly wrong but it will be difficult to correct the evil untill the general public survey is made The agent of the Unit[ed] States for the preservation of the public timber in Florida complains much of the difficulties which he has to encounter from these indefinite claims it is hoped they will soon be removed.—I wrote you by last mail requesting amongst other things to be informed whether Co.'

whether it was confined to making the compilation of Spanish Laws ordinances &c.”—I have since on reflection determined not to interest myself in this matter & withdraw the request hopeing that you will not have been at the trouble to write when this arrives.—should not]

SIR, I am requested by the Sec of the Treasury to inform you that the President proposes to engage you as assistant Counsel in the cases of Fernando dela Maza Arredondo, and the two cases of Forbes
& C** These persons claim lands in Florida under Spanish titles, the validity of which will be subjected to judicial decisions under the provisions of the Act passed on the 23" May 1828.” As those claims embrace upwards of two million of acres, and cover a considerable portion of the best and most valuable lands in Florida, as they are of a questionable character and embrace many important points that will require the most diligent and laborious investigation which the President is well assured that you would be able to give to them and

as they lie in three different Judicial districts, the Territorial Courts for two of which are held at places very remote from your residence, the President proposes to allow you as a fee $500. for preparing for trial and arguing each case in the Territorial Courts, $500 of which can be now paid: and a further fee of $1000. for attending to and arguing each of these cases that may be brought up to the Supreme Court of the U.S. and which it may be deemed necessary that you should argue. These last fees to be paid on the argument of each case respectively.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE 28th March 29
SIR, In the earliest interview which I had with you, after you did me the Honor to communicate your wish, that I should take upon myself the office of the Attorney General of the United States, I took occasion to mention to you, that I had entered into certain professional engagements, with some of the Claimants of lands, in the territory of Florida, which I should be bound to fulfil, and consequently that it would become necessary to engage counsel to represent the interests of the United States in these cases—You thought, as I

did, that this circumstance presented no difficulty, and I acquiesced in the call with which you had honored me—
It now becomes necessary to act upon this—The District Attorney of East Florida, has transmitted to this office certain documents relating to the claim of Arredondo & Son and others, to a tract of land in that territory, on which he asks advice.” The Court sits in Augustine, on the first Monday in May, and it will consequently be desirable that no time should be lost in providing Counsel to represent the United States in this matter—
I beg leave to suggest that as cases of this sort will probably occur frequently, it may be of importance that some professional gentleman in this vicinity should be selected to prepare the cases for trial on the part of the United States, and that the magnitude of the cases, as well as the novelty of some of the questions involved, will make it important to secure to the Government professional talents of the highest order.”

<place-time>No 33, 1"April 1829</place-time>
<docbody>THO" DOUGLASS Esq.r Dist Atty U.S. S." Augustine SIR, Owing to professional engagements contracted by Mr Berrein before his appointment as Attorney General, the case of Arredondo, among others, has been placed by the President under my direction, and I proceed, at his desire, to answer your letter of the 4th February,”
which, with the accompanying documents, has been handed over to me for this purpose.
Your answer is so full and so judiciously drawn, that it leaves very little for me to suggest in the way of amendment. There are a few points, however, to which I should be glad to call your attention, and which you will please to consider not as substitutes for any ground taken in your answer but as additional and supplemental thereto

that ground, so it may be cancelled by the Sovereign authority of the U.S, and that a Court of equity cannot, consistently with the principles which govern that tribunal, lend its aid to give effect to a grant obtained by fraud and misrepresentation
3. The alleged order of Ramizes, extending the time for commencing the settlement for one year more, is said to have been made on the 2"
Dec 1820.—I should think it advisable that the answer should treat this order as equivalent to an original grant and, therefore, as void, not only for the want of original powers in Ramizes to have made such a grant, but because made at a time when according to the treaty of cession the grants of Spain were no longer to be respected, and made, therefore, in violation of the treaty—See the 8th article of the treaty of cession
4- I should think it proper to insist in the answer that the long fixed and settled policy of Spain was to parol out her colonial domain with reference to the single object of population, and that, according to that policy, grants for the purpose of speculation, were not tolerated:
that the rule which required the settlement to commence within three years, did not contemplate a mere formal commencement, which should open the lands immediately to speculation in the hands of the grantee, but a fair and bona fide commencement to be followed up and completed with all reasonable diligence; whereas, in the present instance, it is manifest from the shewing of the Petitioner, themselves, that the purpose of Arrendondo and Son in obtaining this grant (if it ever was obtained) was, in direct contravention of the settled policy of the Spanish Crown, for the purpose of Speculation and sale: that if anything like a settlement was ever attempted by Arredondo & Son within the time limited by the grant (which ought to be denied) it was a mere colour and shew of a commencement, for the purpose of proceeding at once to their leading and paramount object of Speculation, as will be manifest from the dates of the several deeds set forth with the petition
5—You have said in your answer that there was nothing in the circumstances set forth in the petition to absolve Arredondo and Son from a compliance with that condition of settlement on which the validity of the grant was to depend: I concur entirely with you in this position—I would have added that as the grant itself, upon that express condition, was the Act of a Sovereign, it was not a matter for judicial enquiry whether any circumstances had arisen to excuse a compliance with that condition, but that it was competent only to the Sovereign who had imposed the condition, to release it, or to excuse a

non compliance with it: and now to the Sovereign power of the US
who have taken, under the treaty, the place of Spain.
6–It would seem from the evidence before the board of Commissioners in the case of Levy,” a purchaser under Arredondo & Son, that this was not the only grant which Arredondo had received in EFlorida from the Spanish Intendant, but that there had been a previous grant or grants to him. Whereas I understand that, according to the Spanish regulation, the petitioner was required to take an oath that he had received no previous grant—The correctness of this conjecture will, I understand, soon be tested by an Agent who will be sent by the Government to Havana to examine the Spanish Archives with reference to this and other subjects of enquiry. Should the fact turn out to be as I have supposed, it will be proper to introduce this fact into your answer as a new and distinct grounds for avoiding the last grant on the ground of fraud and imposition on the Spanish Authorities There will be no difficulty in your obtaining leave to withdraw the original answer, and file a new one in which you can incorporate, at the proper places in your former answer, the suggestions which I have made: or if the withdrawing your former answer should be objected to, you can, without doubt, have leave to file a Supplimental answer taking these new grounds.
I would recommend that you move for an order on the petitioner to file all the original papers on which he relies, for the purpose of ascertaining by inspection the genuiness of those papers and the modes of authentication and, among other things whether they be rubricated according to the Spanish forms and in what books belonging to the Spanish Archives they have been registered and recorded: this latter clue ought to be in the hands of the agent who visits the Havana Among the papers which ought thus to be filed should be the petition of Arredondo & Son for this grant for the purpose of ascertaining more precisely the representations on which this grant was founded.
This paper, nor a copy of it, is not among the papers annexed to the petition: nor is the report of the Surveyor Pintado. They ought both to be there I recommend, also, that a call be made for the specific power from the crown of Spain to Ramizes, under which he professes to act in making this grant. The recital of such a power in the grant will not suffice. We must see the power itself or an authentic copy of it; and the Agent who visits Havana ought to compare this copy with the original, or to take a copy from the original while at Havana. I am

strongly under the impression that Ramizes had no such powers—
and that what he alludes to in the grant was simply a letter from the King exhorting him, in general terms to encourage the settlement of the Province by all the means in his power—which can be fairly construed only as referring to an encouragement within the scope of the standing regulations—I find that the commissioners of the land claims in West Florida refer to an edict of the King of Spain in 1754
as the basis of all the colonial land regulations: this document I have not seen, though it may possibly be in the back of those regulations which is about to be published here by the authority of the government”—I would recommend that whatever Spanish edicts or regulations are relied on in the trial of the cause should be incorporated in the record—or so specifically referred to by the Record as to leave no doubt of their identity when the cause comes here I have &c Wm.

<docbody>GEORGE GRAHAM Esquire Commr Gen' Land Office Sir By the last mail I received your favour of the 17" ult." In which you request me to State to you in detail the particular services that have been rendered in my district by M. Brents the Agent appointed under the sanction of the act approved the 23" of May 1828.”
And also as far as practicable the extent of the services that may probably be required of him within th[e] present year. In answer to which I have to state that M. Brents visited this district in the month of November last while our Superior Court was in Session &
spent about ten days examining the papers and documents relating to that class of claims which it was expected would be brought before the court under the act above mentioned, but one suit had then been instituted under that act, I furnished him Copies of the petition and answer in that case, which he examined & stated his views with regard to the course which should be pursued in the defence, I am not aware that any other services have been performed by M. Brents in this district, or that up to that period there were any other for him to perform. It is impossible to determine at present the extent of the services that may probably be required of him within the present year. only seven suits have as yet been instituted, although there are about eighty claims which come within the provisions of the act. from the indifference hitherto manifested in relation to a large portion of these claims I am inclined to believe that they will never be prosecuted, in every suit more or less oral testimony must be taken, but it appears to me that a general superintendant whose duties extend to the other three judicial districts as well as to this, cannot attend to this duty and that the discharge of it must necessarily] devolve principally upon the resident attorney, and] permit me to assure you that so long as I am honoure[d] with the place which I now hold it shall not be n[eg]lected.
I am Sir with great respect yours &c THO DOUGLAS

<place-time>Key West, FLORIDA, 9" April, 1829</place-time>
<docbody>THE HON. SAM D. INGHAM, &c. &c.
SIR: The defenceless situation of the inhabitants of this Island and the dangers to which they are continually exposed are subjects of so

much solicitude that I am induced to present them a second time for the consideration of the Government.—Occupying an insulated spot, more than two hundred miles from the nearest Military post, or, indeed, any other place from which the smallest aid could be procured, surrounded by a sea infested with pirates and other depredators almost as lawless, you will believe, that a few unarmed inhabitants have but little reason to felicitate themselves upon the security afforded to their persons & property.
When I first came to this place, finding that the population was composed of a heterogenous mass, congregated from various parts of the world, many of whom were unacquainted with the operation of our laws, and had for several years been living in a state of unrestrained, and indeed licentious, freedom, I anticipated that the officers, of the Court might meet some difficulty in carrying into effect its judgments and decrees. To obviate this, I addressed a letter to the Delegate from the Territory requesting him to apply to the War Department for a company of troops to be stationed here, to aid them in any emergency which might arise.” To this application Major Gen. M'Comb responded, by directing Col. Brooke to proceed to the island, examine its situation, and report upon the propriety of making it a military post "–This duty has been performed by Col Brooke" and I expect a company of troops will eventually be stationed here; but untill that shall be done, unless some other regulation be made the Islanders and much valuable property must remain in a cruelly exposed situation. When I made the application to the war department, I had no view, other than the one disclosed, but the transactions of every day since, have convinced me that an efficient force is of more importance for other Objects—At this time, the Gulf is infested with a horde of pirates, who shelter themselves among the rocks and in the small inlets along the coast of Cuba, Occasionly darting out upon Our Wessels, murdering & robbing, and sometimes extending their depredations as far as the Coast of Florida.—A short time, since a piratical vessel, manned by upwards of one hundred desperadoes, came to our coast, took a Sloop and compell'd the master to pilot them to such places as they directed—So daring an act convinces me that they are capable of any attempt, and when it is known that large sums of money are frequently deposited here, an attack may be dreaded. But this is not the only

source of uneasiness; many not engaged in open piracy are almost as dangerous and lawless in their conduct:—a few days ago a Brig bound from Havana to Cadiz was wrecked upon the Florida reef—the Brig was lost, but the crew, consisting of 40 persons, were taken off and brought to this place and notwithstanding the services rendered them in preserving the lives and the kindness and hospitality extended to them in their distress they made an attempt to seize the vessels employed for their benefit and after their arrival in port, committed such outrages as compell’d Captain Harrison, of the Revenue Cutter Pulaski, to send out his crew to check them—these men are now at large on the Island, and must remain so, ungarded, until an opportunity can be had of sending them to Cuba.
It is with pleasure I acknowledge that the Officers commanding the Revenue Cutters upon this station have given every protection to the inhabitants at this place, and to our Commerce along the Coast which their limited means would allow. At my request Captain Harrison has been in port, and in the vicinity as much as his other duties would permit; but at no time and under no exigency, could he furnish more than fifteen effective men and this force is believed to be much too small for any beneficial purpose.—If the Crews of these vessels were increased to the extent allowed by law, the most important advantages might be derived from their services not only in securing the revenue but in guarding our commerce from Piratical aggression and protecting the inhabitants of the Island from lawless invasion.—at present they must be wholly inefficient in any hostile operations as there are not more men on board of either than are absolutely required to navigate them and so far from being able to defend our Merchantmen from piratical Cruisers, they could not under the most favourable circumstances, successfully compete with several that are now afloat—
It is for the purpose of asking from you an increase of the force of these vessels, that I have addressed you at this time; believing that the circumstances, by which we are at present surrounded will induce you to grant this request The full compliment, of seventy, men, allowed by law would make them highly effective, but less than fifty at such a time as this, would keep them partially inoperative I have, &c, &c, (signed) JAMES WEBB.

SIR, In your letter of the 5" of January last,” giving me some account of your examination of the inland passage between the S'
John's and the S' Mary's, you say that by the next mail you intended to forward a more detailed Report on the subject. The length of time which has now elapsed, without the receipt of that report, makes me fear that it has been lost;" and to avoid further inconvenience from the delay of funds, a requisition, heretofore delayed, in expectation of your report and estimate, is to day made for $1000 to be remitted to you at Tallahassee, for the purposes of this work. As the sum of
$13500, of which you have been advised, is the whole amount appropriated for the object intrusted to you," it is necessary that the expenditures, on any contract which you may make, including your own compensation, should be confined to this sum; and if it should appear that any further appropriation is necessary for the completion of the work, it will be asked for, on your estimate at a future time—
At the late session of Congress an appropriation of $6.500 was made
“for improving the Harbour of St Marks by removing obstructions in the same”; * this appropriation was based on an estimate of M. D. B.
Macomb, who is engaged on the improvement of the Apalachicola river, and it is desirable to procure a suitable Agent for carrying on the improvement of S' Marks, with as little delay as practicable—I
have therefore to request that you will name to me some person of good character, and competent to direct the work; or if possible, that you will yourself undertake the Agency; in that case, you are requested to adopt measures to have the object of the law carried into immediate execution.”
A copy of M" Macombs Report and map is herewith transmitted.”

<place-time>PENSACOLA, April 12" 1829.</place-time>
<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt by this day's mail of your order of the 23" Ulto.,” in relation to the Road between Pensacola & Blakely, & Mobile Point; and repairing that from Pensacola to Tallahassee.—
I am now on the point of leaving here for New Orleans to be absent a week at farthest; and immediately on my Return shall make arrangements to commence the work—and in the manner suggested—by hired axe-men:—Preparatory to the actual commencement of the work however it will be necessary for me to make some additional examination of the Routes—especially that from Pensacola to Tallahassee.—
I request that you will favor me in the meanwhile with your instructions as to whether the Road between Pensacola & Blakely, & Mobile Point shall be opened & worked upon in the manner recommended in my report of 10" March 1828.”—Also whether in opening the Road from Pensacola to Mobile Point, it is intended that I shall follow the route by “Poncho's Ferry” on the Perdido River as is recommended in that Report. This Route is I think to be preferred at the present time, as it is the only one leading to Mobile Point which will have the advantage of a public Ferry kept by a Citizen either at this or at a future time. On the other mentioned and more direct route, (which is also preferable as to ground,) to Mobile Point, a ferry must be kept up for military purposes only, and is not likely to be the case except in a period of war.—
I am at a loss to understand whether the Road from Pensacola to Tallahassee ordered to be repaired, be the one opened by myself &
called the Military Road, or that upon which the mail is transported;
hence in relation to it I am also constrained to ask your further instructions.—That Road (the Military Road,) owing to the almost utter impracticability of keeping up the Ferry across the Bay at this place, is not nor can ever be of any great utility to the Public generally;—added to this no ferry is now, or has been, kept up for a long time, at the Choctawhatchie River;—This Route, although much the most direct & shortest, yet it leads near to the Sea Coast, cutting numerous streams, through a sandy, sterile, Pine Barren Country, in which there is no prospect of settlements being made; of course the Road is neither used nor worked upon by the Citizens, nor will it ever be kept up by their labor. I know that it would be more agree-

able too, to the Citizens of the Country that the money appropriated should be expended on the Route by which the mail travels from this place to Tallahassee; and which I would myself most respectfully recommend to your favourable consideration; with this difference only, that if a ferry should be established at the Head of Pensacola Bay, as there is now an order of Court for, I would recommend that the money & work should be expended at that crossing in preference to going higher up by “Cotton's Ferry” on the Escambia which is the present route.—The crossing at “Cotton's Ferry” through the swamp is four miles,—and it will take one third of the whole sum appropriated to make that swamp of good passage in high water, owing to wide & numerous Bayous running through it.—If the Ferry is established at the Head of the Bay as spoken of, both Roads join in the high Pine woods opposite to “Cotton's Ferry”, and from thence will be the same.—If it is decided to improve the Post Road to Tallahassee with this appropriation,-and not the Military Road to Tallahassee,—which I certainly think preferable; and it is left to my discretion which of the two Ferrys to pass at, my first step will be to ascertain the difference of labor really required at each, with the wishes of the People themselves in relation to it—as also to all other parts of the Route most proper to work on in expending the amount appropriated.—I must also request to be instructed whether when working on this Road too, I am to be guided in my manner of doing it, by the mode recommended in the said Report of 10* March 1828, touching the Roads to Blakely & Mobile Point.—I have in that Report explained fully my views as to the manner most proper for working on Roads in a Wilderness Country like this:—besides, the small sums appropriated will admit of no other kind of Roads being made.—I will only add further, that in a Country newly settled like this, I have ascertained by experience that the money of the Government is best employed by improving the Roads which the Citizens lay out and use:—and in the present case I should only have to keep in view the mail Road towards Tallahassee, without any extraordinary deviations from that Route which is the most direct as used by the Citizens & by Travellers.—
I am Sir, with perfect respect Y Mo. Ob. Serv"

<docbody>TO/ GEORGE GRAHAM Esq. Gen' Land Office SIR/I am in the receipt of your two favours of the 21 Feby * & 17."
Ult” * These communications reached me irregularly owing to high waters. This cause alone must be my apology, in not giving the latter communication, a prompt and immediate answer. “The particular services that have been rendered in your District by M. Brent's the Agent appointed under the sanction of the act approved the 23rd May 1828” * is the first enquiry made by the Department, and in reply thereto I can only state, that Mr Brent's arrived at Tallahassee in October last—that he advised with me upon all occasion's, touching the interests of the government, and used great dilligence in making the necessary preperations to take testimony in Forbe's case, the only case pending in Middle Florida.—Mr Brent's visited St. Augustine, and returned through this place on his way to Pensacola, and whilst here, we agreed to open two commissions in the aforesaid case—One at Pensacola, and one here.—Upon Mr Brent's] arrival at Pensacola, he informed me of his examination of the public archives, stating that he had discovered important testimony, which would be taken there, under the commission this spring.—This gentleman has not arrived in the Territory that I can learn, tho' he may be at Pensacola at this time, attending the execution of the Commission.—
“It is also desirable, that you should state as far as practicable, the extent of the services that may probably be required of him within the present year[.”]
In reply to this enquiry, I find it difficult to give a prompt and ready answer, inasmuch, as I am in the dark, how far the government

may or may not be disposed to sanction my views already intimated, and now for the first time submitted to the President U. S.–If the government or Petitioner's, open a Commission at Havanna this Spring a Competent Agent must be employed to execute the Commission, and too great care cannot be used in the performance of so delicate a procedure.—The two Commissions refered to, with other testimony I have been enabled to discover since M. Brent's absence, will occupy M. Brent's at least two months, with all the aid I can give him.—If the government and Petitioners determine not to open a foreign Commission, this case will be ready for argument in October term next in all probability.—M. Brent's services will be highly important in the necessary preperation of this case, and no doubt he can employ himself, so as to answer useful purposes to the government.—I need not remind the department of the importance of this case, embracing some of the richist portion of the public domain in Middle Florida—covering nearly two millions of acres, and taking in, within it's portentous grasp, many of the most important commercial depots of Florida.—The citizens of Middle Florida, are impatient for it's settlement, indeed, the agricultural & commericial interests of this people are very much cramp" and impeded by the doubts which cloud this subject.—No efforts of mine have been spared to bring about this desirable end, yet there is too much at stake, to allow me to act precepitately or incautiously.”—
I would remind the government, that the Honb" Mr Berrien Atty Gen' U S is employed by the eehamissiehers Petitioners in this Case, and tis presumed, he will reserve to himself the privelege of fulfilling his engagements to his clients.—This state of things, necessarily precludes us from advising with the Atty Gen' in the progress of this cause, and with whom by law I am authorised to consult and advise.—
I hope measures will be taken touching this latter point, so that I may be enabled to advise with a master workman of the profession, and that I may not be called upon to shoulder the whole responsibility of this Case.—

<docbody>SIR: Your favor of yesterday is received * and I also regret not having an opportunity of a conference with you before you leave the city. With regard to the Land Claim to which your note refers, I
have to observe that when I requested M. Graham to confer with you on the subject, and especially as to the amount of a retaining fee that would be satisfactory to you, I requested him to say, that the President desired you to consider yourself as retained in all the disputed claims in Florida and Missouri, arising under Spanish grants which might depend upon similar principles. It was under this view of the subject that I suggested to the President the propriety of giving you a retaining fee of one thousand dollars, which he consented to, with an understanding that an additional fee should be paid for arguing each of the cases of Forbes and Arredondo in Florida, and that of Soulard ” in Missouri, and such of the other cases as the President may hereafter deem proper to employ assistant counsel to argue in the Supreme Court. Should other cases of the same character be ascertained in Alabama or elsewhere, there can be no objection to including them in the engagement, which will be the more necessary for the reason stated by you in relation to the propriety of giving instructions to the District Attorneys in preparing the cases for trial in the Courts below.
Instructions will be given to the District Attorneys to correspond with you through the Treasury Department,” and every other facility in the management of these very important causes that can be afforded will be granted with the greatest readiness.

to my knowledge ought to be removed no man could have been more indecently abusive of you, The Indian Agent Col" Humphreys" who ought long since to have been removed for misconduct in his office and Judge Smith of the Eastern district, a man who was dismissed with disgrace from our army, as to vile to hold any command, is thought pure enough to grace the ermine for this Territoy—Sir we look to you as the father of this Territory it is truly the child of your own creation—It was the success of your arms that first, induced to Spain to surrender a country that she found it too dangerous to maintain, when you consented to become the Governor of Florida you were promised that your friends should be provided for. it was a long time ere they were noticed and then, very partially I beg of you to remember them now and aid us in giving a character to our Territory it richely deserves—Their is not one man in 50 throughout the Territory that does not revere you for your virtues & services, and yet nearly two thirds of all the appointments made by the Late administration, were in direct opposition to the wishes of the People, Believe me sir it is from no influence of any vindictive feelings that I call your attention to these facts—The honor interst and character of the Territory and can with truth add, its prosperity will in a great degree depend on the changes that shall

be made; In this district we have an able and invaluable judge the secretary of the Territory is a capable, firm and valuable officer, and one Marshall Majr Adair is esteemed and valued by all who know him I solicit from you for Col" James W Exum,” the office of Marshall for West Florida,—The present incumbent, is nether intitled to confidence] or ever possessed the esteem of the People, his buisness or much of it is transacted by deputy, who is most obnoxious to the people, and whom I know to be destitute of every honorable feeling or principle.

M. Brent the land agent who was appointed for Florida, has never but once been here, and that for a short time, when he returned to Kentucky much against my advice—I represented to M' Brents the importance of taking several depositions in the case of Forbes claim, that I believed to be important. He promised he would take the Testimony before he left the Territory—He failed to do so.—and one of the most important witnesses has since died; he was an old & infirm man, which was knon to M' Brents—The law Agent has not yet been heard from, and I hope you will appoint Co" Richard C. Allen to fill his place. This appointment will give much satisfaction, as the Settlers on the land had determined to imploy him as assistant counsel with Gen". Call Co." Allen is a sound and correct Lawyer and possess,s all the industry and patience requiste for this laborious investigation No man is more highly esteemed in this quarter, or is intitled to more confidence I hope sir as he is known to you both as a civilian & soldier, for he served with you in your campain through Florida and was with you at

<docbody>JAMES G. RINGGOLD. Dist. Atty. Tallahassee F. and to B. D. WRIGHT
Esq SIR, The Hon: Joseph M. White having been retained as assistant Counsel under the provisions of the Act of May 1828,” in all the cases that may arise under that act with the exception of those of F. M.
Arredondo & Son, and of Forbes & C° and as it is of much importance that the cases should be properly prepared before they are presented to the Courts, and that each and every point on which the U States may rely for the purpose of defeating the claim, should be clearly and distinctly stated in the answer to each bill filed against the U States:
you will therefore call on M* White for his aid and advice in drawing your answer in each case (with the exceptions above stated) in which you may deem such aid and advice necessary or desireable. M"
White is specially engaged to argue, not only in the Courts below, but in the Supreme Court all cases pronounced by the Board of which he was a member, fraudulent, if any such case can come before the Courts, and in all cases in Florida depending on British claims, and under his general retainer the Government considers him bound to argue any case that it may be deemed necessary that he should argue in the Courts below."
I enclose for your information & guidance an extract from a letter from Mr Wirt to the Secretary of the Treasury," which altho' written more particularly in reference to the cases in Arkansaw, yet the general suggestions are also applicable to many of the points that will be embraced in the cases arising under the Act of May 23* 1828.

In consequence of the previous engagement of the Attorney Gen', M” Wirt has been retained in the particular cases of Arredondo &
Son, and Forbes & C° and in such other cases as the engagements of the Attorney General may render it inexpedient for him to argue in the Supreme Court. I am, therefore, directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to request that your answers to the bills filed not only in each of the cases above mentioned, but in every other case of importance arising under the Act alluded to, should be transmitted thro'
this Office for the purpose of being submitted to M'. Wirt before such answers are filed.
As the cases will probably resolve themselves into several classes of cases which embrace the same points, and will require similar answers it will of course not be necessary to forward your answers in more than one case of each of such classes.—
It is also presumable that a few cases may be selected which will involve each and every point on which it may be necessary to obtain the decision of the Supreme Court. Such cases if possible should first be prepared for trial and brought up on appeal, leaving the other cases untried below to abide the decisions of the Supreme Court.—
I am also instructed to express the desire of the President that your particular attention and vigilance be given to the management of all the cases arising in your District under the provisions of the Act of the 23" May, 1828. and that in drawing up your answers to the Bills filed, you take especial care to embrace every point on which the United States may possibly rely for defence."

& Son, it is beleived that that case will depend, at least in part, on other principles than those stated in y” letter to me of the 14th of August 1828,” and will embrace points for decision which are common to many other cases in Florida, arising under the Act of May 1828.—
I have repeatedly sent to the Printers to expedite the printing of the documents furnished by you, and had delayed writing to the District Attornies & yourself under an expectation of being enabled to forward these documents, but I am now informed that they are in type but that the manuscript is so inaccurate that the printer cannot publish them until it be corrected."

<docbody>HB JOHN H. EATON Secratary at War SIR, On the 12" Jany. last. I rec" a communication from Co.'
Tho" L M*Kenney "by order of the then Sec. at War requireing my services in the investigation of certain charges or complaints against Co' Gad Humphreys Ag" for the Seminole Indians. That duty was immediately commenced, & as far as possible has been concluded some time since. But from bad health & other unavoidable circumstances I have not been able at an earlier period to report proceedings As many of the complainants & Witnesses relied on were residents of St. Augustine & vicinity, I considered that the most proper &
convenient place to open the investigation, accordingly apprised Co'
Humphreys of my determination From the magnitude of the charges & the ardor with which they had been pressed, not a doubt was entertained but that all needfull assistance would be afforded to facilitate the investigation What was my surprise to find the reverse—Those who had been most clamourous appeared most disposed to evade the enquiry—And in one instance there was a positive refusal, either to sustain his charges by his own affidavit or the testimony of others. he appeared displeased that the Gov" had not taken earlier notice of his complaint, * Ante, p. 55.

stated he had settled his business with the Agent in his own way &
the Gov" might do so likewise—his property had been surrendered to him some months back & he cared no more about it This was M* Z.
Kingsley at present a Post Master on Ft. George Island (and the only resident on it (as I am informed) I should not have named this individual or detaled these circumstances had he not held an Office—
more valuable to himself than important to the Gov'—His letter containing charges, was addressed to the Hb' J.M. White & is herewith returned in package N° 1–
Out of all the charges Direct & indirect that had been made only the four contained in N° 10—were attempted to be sustained To the first charge see (N° 10.) the three Depositions Marked (A)
were taken they do not sustain the charge—They shew no want of respect for the orders of the Department or zeal in the discharge of duty the Letter to M Lancaster (spoken of by Lowe) the Agent does not deny but explains to be an act of friendship not incompatible with duty, it was designed to give Chaires or his Atty. notice that he the Agent was about to have delivered the negroes in obedience to the order he had rec". So that he could have an opportunity of asserting, by due course of Law an adverse claim to this property.
(which could not be done whilst the Indians held possession The second Charge is in my opinion no better sustained, the Deposition of W. Smith Esq" was the only one taken see (B) 'tho he is entitled to entire confidence as a man of strict verasity, he was evidently mistaken as to the delivery of the Negroe Girls, I learned from M. Kingsley, that the Girls had been delivered & sold in the month of July last, of this I presume M. Smith was not informed.
this charge was predicated upon a Volunture, Exparty, affidavit of W" Everet—Strong & explicit. But from all I can learn of this mans Character, any Statement coming from him should be rec" with caution. Mr John Buck to whome he refers (in a letter to me (Marked B.B.) contradicts his whole statement. I called on him expecting a confirmation, but he declined giving evidence as he says, out of Delicascy to Everett. I have but little confidence in the statement of either of them.
On the third charge the Deposition of M. Morgan was taken (See C) He stated that the Work done by him in setting sugar Kettles for Co.' Humphreys as well as the Chimney to the Agency House was all charged to the United States—he likewise gives it as his opinion that the labour & materials furnished by Co." Humphreys on the Chimney, was worth fully as much as the price charged for setting up the Kettles. Let this be admitted and yet the least that can be said. It is certainly a loose, careless, & unjustifyable manner of

transacting business—It would have but little trouble for the Agent to have kept a regular account of the Labour & Materials supplyed by him, the Gov" could then have known for what they were paying To the fourth charge S. Streeter was examined (see D) Much testimony could have been procured to establish this charge in part, Wiz, that the Indians were in the practice of leaving there own boundary & roaming throughout the Territory greatly to the anoyance &
injury of the Citizens It is within my own observation & was admitted by the Agent. But he denies having the power to controle them in that respect—Not knowing how far his authority extends, or what power he has, I can only state that the evil exists to a verry great extent—Some exertions were made but without effect to restrain them. whilst I was in the Nation. The Agent sent out a small atthaber detachment to arrest & bring in a party of Indians charged with committing some depredations. But they escaped pursuit &
could not be found To account for the reason why so few depositions were taken &
the length of time employed about it, It is necessary to state that in all most every case there was an absolute refusal to give testimony unless in obedience to a compulsory process On application to the District Atty. to know if such could be had he gave an opinion that it could not—The Witnesses were scattered over several hundred miles of Country, & both the weather & the Roads extremly bad.
finding it impossible to procure the attendance of witnesses I thought, time would be saved by adjourning from place to place so as to be in there immediate neighbourhood. Accordingly I removed from S'
Augustine to S' Marys. thence to Camp King The time allowed Co' Humphreys to make his defence has expired, it has not yet been furnished me. probably owing to some failure in the mail. If so it may be expected next week. When rec" will forward it with such remarks as may appear necessary"

<docbody>SIR My absence from this place on official duty for three weeks past is my apology for not having sooner answered your communication of 17th ultimo 7"
The services which M Brents has already rendered in my district of Florida consist of some arrangements which he made with me when

he was here some months since for taking Depositions on behalf of the United States in relation to a claim in the Middle District and of some written memoranda which he prepared for my guidance in the matter I understood also from himself and do not doubt that he made a somewhat laborious examination of the original documents in the office of the keeper of the public archives in this place The weight of the duties of M" Brents lies in Middle Florida. There were presented to the Commissioners two claims for large tracts of land by John Forbes & C° One of these claims, and the most valuable of them lies in Middle Florida. It is supposed that the decision of the Superior Court upon this claim will test the validity of the other which is situate in this District. I presume therefore that the latter claim will be presented to the Court of this District more for the sake of preserving to the claimants the right secured to them of bringing the suit than with a view of litigating the subject here In relation to the other claims in West Florida I doubt much if the services of M. Brents will be necessary at all. The claims here are of small value—will not exceed two in number—and the only one on which suit has yet been brought is of undoubted validity I will avail myself of the present opportunity to say that if a seven years acquaintance with the titles to land in this country—the fact of my being the representative of the Government in this District—
and that of my having superintended the taking of all the testimony which has been taken in relation to the claim of Forbes & C° should be thought by the President to qualify me in any degree to be useful to the United States in the Court of the Middle District I will willingly attend the trial of the large claim above mentioned, on being instructed to do so. I believe the claim to be decidedly bad; and it cannot be doubted that the Territory will ultimately suffer even more than the United States from its confirmation *

GENERAL, A day or two since Judge H. M. Breckenridge called upon me respecting the work to be done under the appropriation, on the Road from this place to Tallahassee.—I informed him that I
had requested from you further instructions; and also recommended

a different Route, from what is called the Military Road, as being in my opinion the one most proper for the money to be expended on.
He stated that he should write you on the subject, & oppose by argument my opinion; and requested me to do the same. I have however no other arguments to offer than those now before you embraced in my letter of the 12" Inst." and all my correspondence respecting this Road from its commencement up to this time.—I ever believed that no ferry could be kept up over this Bay opposite to Pensacola, and I
believe so still.—It is however, I ought to remark, the Judges' wish to leave the Military Road Seventy five miles East of Deer Point,”
& there take up a new Route which would fall into the Post Route, or nearly so, West of the Choctawhatchie River.—Before I commence work, therefore, I shall await your decision on the Judge's arguments;
who has very politely expressed his great satisfaction that I should have been appointed to superintend the work.—And it only remains for me now to say, that let whichever of the Routes may be determined upon, I shall expend the money thereon, in the most economical manner, & to the best possible advantage for the public service, my judgement is capable of.-

Indians.” together with such remarks as I thought necessary—Informing you that his defence had not then come to hand on yesterday I
rec" the inclosed. Nothing therein contained appears to render necessary any alteration in what I then stated—I had seen & conversed with each of the witnesses whose affidavits are inclosed. attended to the taking of some of them & was fully apprised of what the others would state they had there full weight when my remarks were written.
The Agent speaks in terms of dissatisfaction of the Ex party manner of conducting the enquiry and the want of presission in the charges—
altho from my letter of instructions, it appears I would have been perfectly justifyable in proceding Ex party yet I, could not believe it was the wish of the Gov" that I should do so. therefore gave Col H.
notice of the plan & offered to weight his own time, within reason, he declined attending. I then proceeded without him, & informed him I was doing so. he then waived his objections & attended untill the business was closed.
I was req" to arrainge the charges or complaints under Gen.' Heads
& proceed with the testimony in each seperately till finished. then furnish Co' H. with a copy & allow him a reasonable time for his defence. I did not deem it my duty nor did I think it necessary to make out charges & specifications in form—Nor could I have done so from the material furnished—Gen.' Heads was all that was req" and it will appear from the examination of witnesses that those Gen.'
charges were understood by time with no feeling to gratify. or object to effect save the General wellfare: I determined as far as possible to assertain the true state of the complaint & for that purpose made use of all proper means to procure testimony by calling on all & every individual who had lodged complaints & those refered to by them at the same time affording the Agent an opportunity of Cross examination.
& the examination of such as he thought proper to call on. Many &
obstinate dificulties presented themselves, (as they were alluded to in my last. not necessary here to repeat).—from the extrem bad state of the Roads & weather. & from great exposure bad health ensued which procrastinated the enquiry beyond what might be deemed a reasonable time for such services. When all things are taken into consideration I hope the business has been transacted in a way to meet the approbation of President.

[Enclosure:ALS]
Gad Humphreys to Alexander Adair SEMINOLE AGENCY 27* April 1829.
ALEX ADAIR Esq." Special Agt. War dpt.
SIR, Upon a review of the testimony adduced in support of the complaints against me, which under the authority of the dept of War, you have been engaged in investigating, I do not conceive it requisite to enter into a formal defence—it seems to me, that it would be poorly complimentary to the good sense of the President, and any thing but respectful to him, to suppose, that a studied argument is necessary, to convince him, of the entire groundlessness of the accusations, nay more, that the Statements, which form their basis, are the offspring of malevolence and cupidity; for I may safely assert, and without the fear of well grounded contradiction, that there is not, in the whole mass of testimony taken in the case, one particle of such proof, as would be admissable in a court of law, which goes to sustain even a single charge, enumerated in the catalogue of my alledged enormities;
nor has there indeed, been any proof, legal or illegal furnished on the part of the prosecution (if we except the affidavit of the draggooned affiant, William Everitt) which is not wholly destroyed by overwhelming opposing testimony, and even Everitt's assertions are in substance positively and unqualifiedly contradicted, by the statement of his associate in business, Mr Buck; which statement, though not made under oath, is equally valid in law, with the procured exparte affidavit it contravenes, and decidedly more to be respected, as evidencing regard for truth; a principle, which is not to be found among the characteristics of the affidavit.—Gross as is the Statement of Mr Everitt, I must confess that it does not surprise me! When I
consider his character, and reflect in whose hands he was, when his statement was made; I only wonder that his pliancy of conscience was not further used against me. Here for the present I leave him and his employers to such enjoyments as their own sober reflections upon their conduct in this matter, may bring with them.—There is another witness in the case, (Waters Smith Esq") whose elevated standing, claims from me for his statements, the tribute of a passing notice—
The high respect heretofore entertained by me, for this gentleman renders the task which justice to myself imposes of pointedly adverting to his testimony, peculiarly unpleasant, nevertheless, duty seems to forbid, my passing unheeded, the glaring discrepance which a comparison of his statements, with those of three other gentlemen of equal respectability so clearly exhibits.—Mr Smith states on the 19*
of Feby. 1829, that a negro woman named Sally; whom he was empowered by Mr Kingsly to receive from me, as Agent for the Seminole

Indians; though often applied for, had not been delivered.—His language upon the subject at the date before named is, “This woman has not been delivered”
By the certificate of Maj Glassell, and the depositions of Lt Newcomb and Assistant Surgeon Hawkins," it will be seen, that this woman had as early as November or Dec 1828, (at best 3 or 4 months previous to the date of Mr Smiths statement) been delivered by me to a person fully and specially authorized by him, not only to receive, but sell her; and of the fact of said delivery and also of a sale, he had been seasonably and distinctly advised—How under such circumstances, it was possible for him to deny the delivery, I am utterly at a loss to imagine, unless it may be attributed to a treachery of his memory, and this I would fain believe to be the fact, and indeed I would adopt almost any belief upon the subject, sooner than draw the conclusion, that he had, under the solemnity of an Oath, wittingly mistated—Over this transaction (much as it was calculated to injure me, and strange as it may appear) I freely say, let the veil of Charity be thrown, and let the remembrance of it pass away, never to be recalled; If he has acted honestly, his own conscience will bear him out, if wickedly, there is a tribunal before which he must inevitably answer for it—With the witnesses I have now done! It was not my intention in the first instance to have said as much, I will only add that there are reasons abundently substantial, which would have fully justified me in altogether declining to answer the charges, had I felt so disposed,—
waiving hewever these ebjeetiehs (weighty as they are) ever influeheed by the wish- The exparte and of course illegal mode directed in the case by the dep", as exhibited in your letter of instructions, (leaving me no room to doubt from the character thus stamped upon the investigation, in its outset; that it was designed, not to promote the ends and further the sacred cause of justice, but as an engine to be wielded for the unhallowed purpose, of gratifying personal dislike and advancing selfish views)—and again, the total want of Specificness in the charges, as to facts dates &c &c—These or either of them, if urged, must in a legal point of view, have formed an insuperable objection to the proceedings—Waiving however these considerations, (weighty as they are) and influenced by the wish to encourage a free and full enquiry into my conduct, which had been subjected to the repeated aspersions of interested and malignant libellers; I determined to remove all obstacles depending upon myself and give such a latitude in the examination as should leave my enemies no room for quibble, or ground for after insinuations of an unkind nature, and at the same time place the prosecution in its true light.—befere the geverañaeht

Having said thus much I shall here leave the case to rest upon its own merits, sustained by my own consciousness of rectitude of purpose in the discharge of my public duties, and relying confidently for an entire acquittal upon the justice of my Government.”

<docbody>SIR. The communication of the Chief Engineer of the 21" March
1829.” has been received and would have been attended immediately but for my absence on the Appalachicola River.
I herewith transmit to the Department Duplicate abstracts of disbursements on acct of the survey of the River and Harbor of St Marks Florida, and also Duplicate accts Current with the U States for the above survey, whereby it appears that a Balance is due me of
$87.87 a receipt for which is also transmitted and which amount I
request may be paid to General Alexander Macomb for purposes of which I have advised him.
I have twice visited the River Appalachicola with the view of renewing operations in that quarter but the water I found entirely too high, and the weather too cold to work advantageously. I only wait for a subsidence of the present freshet, to attack again the River of Sticks. The amount of labor expended upon that part of the River during the month of November, has thus far proved advantageous to the navigation of the River by Boats of all kinds, and has completely tested the principle in the removal of the island, a part of which only was dug away last fall. I find that there has been no farther accumulation of drift wood and that the island has only to be removed on the one side and a quantity of old drift wood on the other side, to give a sufficient vent for the whole of water of the river I have every thing in readiness to give an immediate attention to the Removal of the obstructions of the whole River as soon as the water subsides.”

<dochead>PRESENTMENT OF THE GRAND JURY (SOUTHERN DISTRICT)</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.: DS *]</source>
<place-time>[May 9, 1829]</place-time>
<docbody>At a Session of the Superior Court of the Southern Judicial District of Florida, holden at Key West, 9" day of May 1829: the Grand Jury came into Court; and through their Foreman, Feilding A.
Browne Esq. handed in the following general Presentments: to wit, The Jurors of the Territory of Florida and the body of the County of Munroe, having closed the duties with which they were charged, would represent a grievance of which they have heretofore complained.
At the November Term of this Court, the then Grand Jury represented to the Court, the situation of the Jail of the Town of Key West, and strongly urged the propriety of an appropriation on the part of the General Government, to build one adequate to our wants.
Living in an isolated spot, apart from the main land and without the ability to procure assistance in the want of its necessity; the Jury are strongly impressed, not only with the pecularly dangerous situation of the Inhabitants of this Island; but from the present condition of the Jail, with the unfortunate situation of those who are confined:
Self preservation and the common feelings of humanity compel the Jury to ask some assistance from the Government, to effect so desirable an object, and as a furtherance of their views: they present the following reasons.
It is a matter too generally known, to require discussion, that the great majority of the population of this Island, is composed of Mariners, employed in the wrecking business, and it was to determine their rights and of those interested in such cases and protect the Revenue that a Court was organized at this Island—The habits the mode of life of Mariners when upon shore, are also well known—and though this Jury believe this population to be as good and orderly as in any other portion of the Union yet, here as in all other places, the strong arm of the Law is too often required to preserve order among them and punish the guilty.

Coming from all parts of the world and of every class and denomination, it is but rational to suppose that the law should be often exercised to punish offenders under the law, by imprisonment is here impracticable—The Territory has no Jail The Town Council of Key West, have by subscription erected a small Jail about twelve feet square, in which all prisoners are confined; and at this period, three or four imprisoned, for offences against the laws of the United States.
We further present, that humanity dictates the erection of a Jail, in consequence of the confined state of the prison: one died there during the last fall, and two are seriously ill for the want of air and exercise and during this summer, we know not what may happen but anticipate evil.
We are under the peculiar protection of the General Government of the United States, and we appeal to its liberality, to its justice to erect a building; so necessary for our safety and the lives of prisoners.
We present as a grievance the want of a Jail and respectfully urge upon the Government the propriety of erecting one on this Island Given under my hand & seal of office [L. S.] the 4* day of February 1830.—

<docbody>CAPT: D. E. BURCH, Asst: Quarter Master Pensacola—Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 12" Ultimo.”—You will exercise your own judgment, in regard to the course of the proposed road from Pensacola to Mobile Point. The route by way of “Panchos Ferry,” though somewhat longer, seems to combine more advantages than the other, taking into view the relation it holds to Blakely, that it coincides in part, with the road from thence to the Point, and that there is an established ferry on it. The amount appropriated, and of which you have been advised, will determine the description of

road which is to be made. That referred to in your letter of the 10th of March 1828,” seems very well suited to the nature of the country through which these roads pass, and the objects in view in opening them.—
With respect to your proposition to apply the means at disposal, to the repair of the road on which the mail is now carried between Pensacola and Tallahassee instead of the military road, I have to remark, that the appropriation is specifically for the repair of the latter, and there would be an objection to departing materially from its course. If the present post road intersects the Military road at an inconsiderable distance from Pensacola, and is located on better ground, it might, perhaps, be admissable to do as you propose; but, if as I am inclined to believe, these roads do not intersect each other at all, your suggestion could by no means be adopted, since it would be a misapplication of the appropriation.—I will thank you for further information as to the course of these roads.—
I send you enclosed herewith, copy of a letter from Judge Brackenridge,” making some suggestions as to the best mode of operating on the road to Tallahassee—He has been informed, that you are charged with the superintendence of the work.—

<docbody>SIR I have recently been advised of the institution of a Suit by John Innerarity a member of the House of Forbes & C" against the United States for the recovery of a tract of land embraced between the River Appalachicola and Choctawhachy Rivers, in West Florida.
The grant does not specify the number of acres, but from its bounaries, it must contain between one and two Milions of acres. This is one of the cases in which I have been employed by the Government as assistant Counsel. I expect to receive a copy of the bill in this case in a few days, when an answer shall be prepared. In the case of Forbes & C° you have instructed a copy of the bill and answer to be forwarded to M'. Wirt for his inspection, and I wish to be informed whether it is the wish of the Department that the same course should be pursued in this instance. An other Suit has been instituted for the recovery of a large and valuable Island in the Appalachicola River, said to have been granted to John Forbes individually in the year 1811. This is the 3"Suit which has been brought by the members of that House against the United States. I wish to be informed whether it is the wish intention of the government to employ me in the last mentioned case, and if so whether a copy of the bill and answer shall be forwarded to Mr Wirt Or to Mr Berrien.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE June 2* 1829</place-time>
<docbody>SIR On this day your letter dated 7" May was rec" with the Spanish document & as the mail is shortly to depart have but little time to answer it. Owing to the lack of a translation we are as yet unable to judge of the effect of the document. We are however disposed to suspect that it is a Wicked Contrivance of our adversaries together with the Spanish officers to assist the Claim of Forbes & Co. This house had great influence with the Spanish officers & the Claims in the name of this house are now in the hands of a Wealthy & powerful Combination of men, some of whom live at Havannah. Forbes Claims in part are derived from Indian sales & sanctioned by some of the inferior Spanish officers who it is believed had no power to sell or Sanction sales. The Claimants wish if possible by presumption or otherwise if pessible to shew that the higher officers of the Spanish government (even the King) have sanctioned the purchase of the indians & the acts of the inferior officers; or that being informed of these Acts have not disavowed them. This it is believed has been attempted by Causing their statements & evidences of title, to be entered among the Archives at Havannah & from thence among the Archives at Madrid; and furthermore it is believed that the influence of this house through their agents has induced the transmission of the documents (forwarded) to be sent to our government here to be filed among our Archives and in this way to deduce the Conclusion & beliefs that the whole transaction has been fair–
The Claimants have already got papers from Havannah as also from Madrid filed among the papers of this suit. It is believed that the accounts of the sales of these lands was never filed among the archives of Madrid untill the year 1824. Altho we communicate freely with the departments of our government, yet it is thought unnecessary to make the foregoing statement or rather opinion of ours public. We are apprehensive that we shall be under the necessity

of taking depositions at Madrid & Havannah to shew that this attempt to shew that He construe the King of Spains Consent has taken place since the surrender of the Country to the US and that the papers were filed at Madrid in 1824. Perhaps you are informed how the demand on the Spanish government was brought about for these papers. In haste. We are respectfully yours SAMUEL BRENTS Att JAMES G RINGGOLD yS

GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13" Ultimo;"—And to report that I have commenced working upon the Road from this place to Blakely, having engaged a sufficient gang of Negroes with an Active Person to superintend their labour.
This mode is much better than a contract, as it will allow of having a better Road at a less Cost in money, and is moreover preferable to myself in its superintendence.—
I have no doubt but that the appropriation will enable me to complete the Road to Blakely on the plan proposed; and also open in distance more than half of that to Mobile Point; and in that case, as this last Road will be for Military purposes solely, I request you will be pleased to inform me whether I may not be allowed to expend a sufficient sum from out of the appropriation for the Q Mrs: Department to enable me to complete it to the Point.—It would also be proper, I think, while working in that part of the Country, after having completed the Road to the Point, to open the communication by a Road from thence to Blakely, by continuing the Road northwardly to Blakely from the Point where the two coincide;—for which refer to my sketch of 10* March 1828."—This Road too, is required almost exclusively for Military purposes. The additional sum which will be required to complete the first named, I estimate at $2000;
and for the last named $.1000.—In relation to the Roads from Pensacola to Tallahassee, I have to state that the Road on which the mail is carried does not coincide with the Military Road at all; nor does it

intersect it until within a few miles of Tallahassee. I shall therefore make my arrangements to commence the Repair of the Military Road so soon as the Heat of the Summer is over. The first forty miles of the Route is almost entirely destitute of any but unwholesome Pond-water, & in a dry season, a scarcity even of that.—The appropriation of $.3000, will be but barely adequate to place in such repair as I should wish it to be left by me, the first seventy five miles; and which is the portion of it that seems to be particularly interesting to Judge Breckenridge."—
I do not approve at all of his proposition to employ the Inhabitants to work as Labourers on the Road; it would not only be a more expensive, but an insufficient system.—Indeed there is not a single family living in the entire district for Eighty miles East of Deer Point, bounded North by the Waters which empty into and form Yellow Water Bay, and the Sea-Shore on the South. It is well known, I
thought, to every one that the only labouring class of people, are negroes, so far South as this; and it is with them only that I should be willing to undertake to do work; even if the white men could be hired, to whom the very name of overseer would be an insuperable obstacle:—
and it would be equally difficult to get an overseer who would be willing to superintend the work of white men.—

<docbody>Hon" JoHN H EATON Secretary at War.
SIR, The duties which are usually assigned to the governors of Territories in their capacity as Superintendents for which compensation is allowed by the government heretofore, has been taken from me, and allotted to others, while the unprofitable and labourious duties fell on me.” What benefit has resulted to the government by this change, must be submitted to your judgment. What has been effected in relation to the claims for slaves in the Seminolee nation, and how far they have been decided on, is unknown to me.
Whether the interests of our citizens will be promoted, by keeping the Superintendent in ignorance on this subject, you can determine.
To me the citizens look for the protection and delivery of their property. The Indians confide in and follow my advice, when not mislead by those whose duty it is to advise them honestly.
I herewith transmit you a copy of my letter to Owen Marsh of 29*
May 1829, and a copy of his answer of the same date. That the agent has traded largely with the Indians, I have no doubt; and that he claims, and has on his plantation at the agency, slaves belonging to the Indians, which he has no right to hold, I am convinced. Whatever step the government may take in relation to the agent, still the slaves and cattle which he has procured from the Indians, ought to be retained by the order of the Department, until the examination can be made as to the manner he has acquired this property.
If ever the government overlooks the violation of the Act of Congress, which prohibits every person employed in the Indian Department from trading with the Indians,” that moment consigns these unfortunate people to certain destruction. Were I permitted to give an opinion as to the mode of deciding the claims to property in the Indian boundary, it would be to give notice to all parties concerned, to attend at the Agency, —assemble the Chiefs of the nation,-and have a fair investigation of the claims on both sides.
When I acted as I did once in this business, this course was adopted, 

and in a very short time, many slaves were given up with the unanimous consent of the Chiefs, and all parties were perfectly satisfied What is said in this letter in relation to the several subjects herein mentioned, is submitted to the Department with the assurance, that I neither wish or expect my opinions to have more weight, than my official station may entitle them to, under the practice of the government, and from my knowledge of your judgment and principles, I confidently look for justice to all the parties concerned "

OWEN MARSH Esqre SIR, The agent of the Seminolee Indians Col G. Humphreys has been charged by the Indian Chiefs with having retained from them a large part of their annuity due to the nation in the year 1826. That he also took from their annuity $500 as indemnity for a part of a crop of sugar cane which he alledged that some Indians of the nation had consumed. That the stock cattle which was given to the Florida Indians under the treaty of 1823 * have not all been delivered to the Indians, and that he yet holds in his own right, a number of stock

cattle which belong to the Indians, some of which he has not paid for, but yet retains—as you acted as sub agent for several years, it may be in your power to answer these questions, and I trust you will do so. The agent has not executed the orders issued by the War Department through me, to deliver slaves at several times to certain citizens of Georgia and Florida who claimed them, but I beleive he has thrown difficulties in the way of the owners of the property in order to purchase up their claims at a reduced price. If you know anything in relation to these facts, please to state it. If you as sub agent executed my order for the delivery of slaves to their owners, was your conduct approved by the agent.
The interests of the country call for an explanation of the conduct of the agent. I have been severely censured by many of my fellow citizens who owned slaves among the Indians, because they entertained the opinion that I have not discharged my duty and compelled the agent to perform his. So far as my authority and power could extend, every thing I could do, was done by me If the agent has disobeyed his orders, or in any particular acted improperly, either towards his Government, our citizens or the Indians over whom he presides, his conduct should be laid before the War Department.
I trust you will give such information as you possess in relation to subjects herein mentioned, or any other that may be know to you, that you consider deserving of attention, I am Respectfully Your Obedient Servt Wm P. DUVAL
[Endorsed] Letter to Owen Marsh—(Copy)
Oren Marsh to Governor DuVal
(Copy) TALLAHASSEE May 29* 1829.
TO HIS EXCELLY Wm P. DUVAL
SIR Yours of this date is received, in which you inform me that charges have been made by the Chiefs of the Seminolee nation of Indians, against Col. Humphreys, Indian agent in relation to the payment of the annuity of 1826 to the chiefs of that nation—also demanding information on several subjects, which are supposed to be subjects of charge against the said Humphreys.
In answer to the first enquiry, I must say that as the payment of the amount due the Indians for that year was made at Baltimore or Washington City—and as I was in the nation myself, it is impossible that I can be personally acquainted with the circumstances: but the following is the story related to me by all the chiefs and interpreters who accompanied him. Col. H. drew the money in the City of Washington, and left for Baltimore, where he paid the chiefs between Two

and Three Thousand Dollars, and took their receipt for the whole due the nation. $450 was paid to two of the chiefs, each, and $200 or $250
a piece to all the others including the colour'd or mixed blooded one, belonging to the Creek nation, 5 in number. This statement was made by the chiefs through the Interpreter to M Hardage, a white man who accompanied them, and who was present at the time the money was paid as he stated to me, and I cannot for a moment doubt his word, for independent of his having the reputation of being one amongst the most honest men in the world, I am personally acquainted with him, and know him to be so.
Col. H. denies to me and other persons that he took any money from them for spoilations upon the crop at the agency, during the year 1827, although he imposes upon the credulous red men with that allegation;
for they have never taken the trouble yet to think on the subject, or they would recollect that their money was taken during the year 1826
and the crop destroyed in 1827. It is but a short time since he has confessed even so much as to admit that he did withold a portion of their due under any pretence.
With regard to the stock cattle which were delivered to the Indians of that nation, I can say very little. I was not at the Agency at the time the stock cattle were delivered, and do not know the number they received: but this fact is certain, he has a large number of cows now on hand, or in his possession, of that stock, and which are in the marks and brands of those delivered by Major Chaires, I have heard him say he purchased them from the Indians, and I have no doubt that he might have purchased some 8 or 10 from them; but cannot beleive he ever bought as many as 70 or 80 head of cows and calves.
Indeed I saw 30 or 40 head of cattle in his yard a few weeks, which never were delivered to the Indians, some of which are now in his possession. This fact can be fully established by calling on M" John Stafford of Alachua, who was employed at the Agency at the time to hunt and mind the stock delivered for the Indians.
He has purchased slaves of the Indians, I beleive at any rate, he had one, a girl called Kate, which he obtained from an Indian woman called Nelly. This one he has sold to a gentleman in the neighbourhood. With this exception, I beleive it would be difficult to prove that he has purchased any from the Indians in his own name, nor do I
beleive he purchased the one above mentioned, for I have been told by the Indians, that she was given to him upon a pledge, that the slaves which were in dispute between Mrs Cook of St: Augustine and the Indian woman, should not be delivered to the white claimant. I
am certain that on one occasion, and I beleive in almost every one, he has thrown every obstacle in his power, in the way, to prevent the delivery to the white claimants of the slaves in the nation.
446774–59–16

The particular case is the one in which M* Everett of Georgia was concerned. If it should be necessary, these facts will be developed.
I was ordered by the agent under that of the Secretary of War, to have delivered to Mrs. Cook of St: Augustine, a large lott of negroes that were in the nation, and executed the order in less than two weeks from the time I received it. The agent appeared to be displeased, and said to several persons and to me, that I had acted improperly and he beleived that if I was worth it, the Indian woman could recover damages of me if a suit was commenced.
He has negroes in his possession, which he beleives and perhaps knows to be the property of an Indian or Indians. They were purchased from a M. Day of N. York, through his agent at St: Augustine, Application was made to him, (the agent) by the Indian claimants to recover the property for them, some one or two years before he made the purchase; and it is beleived that he purchased them much cheaper, by saying to persons who wished to purchase, that if they did buy them, he would have them out of their hands in less than three months.
Col H. has been in the habit of purchasing cattle from the Indians, and of course bought them cheap; and in many instances, he has given them due bills signed “G.” which the Indians have shewn to the officers, some of them at Tampa Bay, and complained that he refused to pay them.
I am very respectfully Your Exc” Obd" Servant OWEN MARSH.

<docbody>SIR, It has been suggested to me, that, in defending the right of the U. States to certain lands in Florida and Alabama, it will be necessary to obtain from the Spanish Government authentic copies of certain reports made by the respective Governors of Florida at the expiration of their offices, called “Residentia,” and which have been made since the Retrocession by Great Britain of Florida to Spain.”
It is further suggested to me, that, for the same purpose, we require authentic copies of any treaties which may have been made with the Indians of Florida by the British Government while in possession of that country. Permit me to ask the favor of you to apply through the proper authority to the respective Governments above mentioned for these documents, and to solicit their procurement at as early a period as may be convenient, there being some reason to ap-

prehend that these very important causes will be urged on before the U. States are fully prepared.”

<docbody>SIR. Your letter of the 2" Instis rec’d." In a letter from Mr Wright the Dist Att” for West Florida he intimates a very decided opinion that the grant to Forbes & Co. West of the Appalachicola Could not be sustained.” He will I presume draw up an answer in this case under your advice and as this claim depends upon principles materially different from those embraced in the claim of the same Firm for lands East of the Appalachicola, I think it advisable that the answer should be submitted to M* Wirt with such observations as you may deem necessary in explanation of the grounds taken in the answer.
As the Island claimed by Forbes is probably on the West side of the main channel of the River, I presume the suit for it has been brought in the Western District. As however the same points will arise for decision in this case as in the case of the lands claimed by Forbes &
Co. which lie on the East side of the Appalachicola and in the Middle Districts, and as y particular attention will be drawn to the investi-

gation of this latter case, you had better draw the answer in the case of the Island & furnish it to Mr Wright to be filed if the suit be in West Florida. It will be unnecessary to send this answer either to M*
Wirt or Mr Berrian and I should think it would be unnecessary to argue this case until there was a final decision in both the cases of Forbes & Co. and on this subject I refer you to my letter of the 23"

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE June 29" 1829</place-time>
<docbody>SIR On the evening of the 22" instant the letter ef the of the Secretary of State was rec" informing me that the president had confered the appointment of Law agent in Florida upon Richard C
Allen.” I was then busily engaged in Closing some answers & other preparations in the several Cases in West & Middle Florida.—As I
was sensible no other person at that time understood those Cases as well as myself, & that the public Service might not suffer, I determined to continue at the place & Compleat the business I was then engaged in. I done so, & surrendered the whole of the papers in good order to M Ringgold and General Call (the law agent not being at the time in town) with my earnest advise & opinion as to the future management of the Cases.—Since that time I have seen the law agent &
imparted to him my advise, such as I thought (if pursued) might ensure Success. I am now about to leave the territory & expect to reach home in about 25 days and while I quit the office under Circumstances which might be supposed by others to subject me to some mortification, yet I feel none on my own account: On the contrary I
have felt peculiarly gratified at the expression of public opinion favorable to my management of the business of the United States in the territory, & a strong desire that I should return to the fall term of the Court at this place & Jackson Court in West Florida to assist in the defence of those weighty Cases arising out of Forbes' grants in which there is so much interest felt by the good people of the territory.—
As an evidence of the estimation in which my services in the territory have been held I inclose you the letters of General Call & M Ringgold,”
which you will be kind enough to preserve & with this lay before the President.—They wrote & handed them to me without Solicitation, & expressed their regret that it was made necessary for me to quit the Service.—My own determination at this time is to return in the fall if able to get back; & in the mean time if it be not improper permit me to request you to forward to me the Compelation of Spanish laws Collected by Colo White. I am in hopes my future labors may compensate the government for this small expenditure. I am not Certain that it will be of any Service–It may be that I have already the same matter in other books.—I have the Strongest anxiety for the Success of the government as to the Claims in Middle Florida one or two in West Florida & a few in the County of Alachua in East Florida.—
A large number of the Claims in East Florida are not worth much—

Scarcely worth a defence—het Nothing but banks of Arid Land or impenetrable marshes, perfectly uninhabitable.—As the connection between myself as an agent & the government is dissolved, it would afford me infinite Satisfaction if my Circumstances in life would enable me to omit the Subject of Compensation alltogether—Such however is not the Case.—My accounts are to be audited at the discretion of the President before whom you will please to lay them &
request an early adjustment.”—My account is here inclosed exclusive of the Annual Compensation which it is hoped the President will raise above the sum of $1500. There was no express agreement between the government & myself but it was Certainly held out as an inducement to me at & before my acceptance, that the Compensation would be at least $2000 per annum. Even of that sum a large portion must necessarily be exhausted in the expences. I Can say with Certainty that all of what I have drawn has been laid out in the necessary expences of the business, altho I have been exceedingly economical.
It is hoped that the President in Closing the accounts will not be influenced by any belief that the business has been in the slightest degree neglected.—Such (permit me to say) has not been the fact altho some well meaning persons about Tallahassee may have thought so.—From the time I rec" the appointment my attention has been incessant altho not always in Tallahassee or even in Florida. Last year before I left home my time had been assiduously employed in preparations derived from the Spanish laws & ordinances & from the reports of the Commissioners & papers pertaining to the particular Cases which had been placed in my hands—These had been attentively Studied.—When I went into Florida I took up residence at Tallahassee, There were very extensive preparations making to Commence suits but not a single suit Commenced.—I left there and went on to attend the Court at St Augustine & there (in the month of November) found only one suit, the very weighty suit brought on the Claim of Arredondo & Son for a large body of the best land in East Florida.
To this Claim my particular attention was directed–It was placed in the best situation for trial. Copies of all necessary papers were obtained to enable me to Study the Case at home & which has been accordingly done. On my return to Tallahassee last fall I found the weighty Case brought on the grants to Panton Leslie & Co & John Forbes & Co for upwards of a Million of acres of the best land in Middle Florida–In this Case there were perhaps 20 quires of Spanish

documents filed.—they were refered to a translator & when translated were to be Copied before any answer Could be made.—To perform the business of translating & making out Copies (a thing indispensible)
required, & actually took upwards of three months. I went from thence to Pensacola taking with me Commissions to take depositions in the last mentioned Case which has been done. The offices of the Archives at S" Augustine & Pensacola were examined & papers obtained preparatory to the Cases brought & expected to be brought.—
When at the last mentioned place (Pensacola) in December finding nothing further to do, which Could not be done any where else as well as in Florida, & finding it important to obtain (by examination of the old papers of the Spanish government at Orleans) the Commissions of the Intendants Morales & others as evidence in an extensive Class of Cases in in Middle & West Florida I formed the design of returning home by the way of the Mississippi, & done so, intending to return to Florida early in the Spring. My time during the whole winter was devoted to the business in Florida.
In the month of March I set out by the way of the Mississippi expecting to be in Florida early in April. On my arrival at Orleans I was detained there between three & four weeks before I Could obtain a vessel for S' Marks—While at Orleans a part of my time was quite profitably employed for the government in examining Spanish books &
procuring some suited to my business. After obtaining a vessel for S' Marks, it was by reason of adverse winds 2 Weeks before I arrived at the latter place being the 8" of May & immediately Commenced business—In a few days after I went to Tallahassee & I believe the whole population of Tallahassee & Surrounding Country as far as they had an opportunity of witnessing can bear testimony to my unremitted attention to the interest of the Country.—On my arrival at Tallahassee early in May, it was found the Claimants had not yet Commenced their suits—They waited untill the last days having untill the
23” of that month to Commence. In the single suit which I had left in Dec in the Court at Tallahassee the translation of the papers, &
Copying had only been Compleated.—Finding none of the suits ready for taking despositions my time has been much employed in drawing answers in the Cases at Tallahassee & West Florida, & it is to me a source of some gratification that in the answers in all the weighty Cases such a history & argument (refering to both law & fact) is left as it is hoped will if followed almost ensure success; & at any rate greatly assist those assigned to pursue the Cases. I have left nothing undone which in my judgement Could be in any degree Serviceable to the government. Believe me Sir I retire from office with perfect Composure entertaining no unfriendly Spirit towards those well dis-

posed friends of mine, who have possessed as much zeal as knowledge in their information to the president, humbly hoping as I do that no injustice to the Country will occur from the appointment of a Successor.—An early answer to this is desired. In haste; desirous of terminating a long absence from my family I must Close by subscribing myself.”

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt on the 24" Inst, of your favor of the 2" June " transmitting a commission of the President of the United States to me as “Law Agent for the Settlement and confirmation of private land claims in the Territory of Florida.” " Absence prevented the receipt by me of the Commission for one week after its arrival, which will account for the delay until this date of an acknowledgement of the Same.—I find in entering upon the duties of the appointment that the business has accumulated to a considerable extent, and will require unwearied industry and attention in preparing the cases for trial. So far as untiring industry and rigid & exclusive attention to the duties pertaining to the Situa-

tion may merit approbation, I am determined to deserve the confidence reposed in me by the President.

SIR, I have further to instruct you in relation to the Military Road leading from Pensacola to Tallahassee."—
That part between Deer Point and Alagua, and that part between Ocheeses and Tallahassee, will be improved. The intermediate space, that is, between Alagua and Ocheesee, being so little travelled as to render repairs of very little use, in fact to make repairs there would be an unnecessary expenditure of public money, and by confining them to the two portions named they can be put in a much better state, than to repair partially throughout.—
Your particular attention is called to the Bridges—pine poles are not to be used, for they are of such a nature as to render them, by rotting, good for nothing in a very short time. The Bridges must be made of Juniper, or light wood and heart of pine.—
The proper places to cross and bridge the Alagua is left to your own decision.”—

<docbody>SIR. The result of my examinations of the obstructions to the inland passage between the S. Johns and S Marys rivers, and of my agency on the work contemplated for its improvement would long since have been reported to you,” had I not found from some experiments made on the soft mud forming the obstacles to be removed, required a reexamination and a change in the plan first decided on—
With the exception of the impediment at the Sisters, which is a bed of oyster shells, the obstructions at the other three points contained in the report of the examining engineers to your Department, are formed by deposits made at the meeting of the tides setting in by the various inlets on that coast—The operation therefore of the currents being a continued one and the mud in the bed of the channel being easily stirred up and as soon deposited, when the cause of its motion ceases, any removal would be but temporary; and new deposits of mud might be expected almost as fast as the banks are removed.
The channel at Fort George dividings eentains is of a greater depth than was contemplated to be given at the Amelia narrows and the Sisters, the extremities of the inland passage)—I have therefore directed the appropriation more particularly to those obstructions and to that at Talbot Island—The Amelia narrows are not only two miles in extent, but very crooked and narrow, as you may perceive by the map—It would require to be straitened widened & deepened, and no work bestowed on it, within the appropriation made, could have been permanent, or could have admitted a passage for any but

boats—On examination I found that Pine Isle. Creek, a branch of Belle river and navigable for Schooners of 100 tons burthen almost to its head, could by a short canal through the marsh be connected with another creek communicating with the Amelia Sound below the narrows; and I was the more inclined to this improvement as it might be made permanent, and could be connected with the more enlarged views of inland navigation contained in the recent able report of Gen.' Bernard on the canal connection of the Gulf with the Atlantic Ocean * —
I could obtain no offers to my proposals for furnishing labor, and but one offer and that from M. Kingsley for executing the work agreeably to the plan last adopted *—An examination of both the beds of the old channel at the different dividings, as well as the marsh thro which the contemplated canal was to be excavated: I found that at a depth corresponding very nearly with the ordinary low tide, and in some instances 1 foot above it, the basis was soft mud almost in a semi liquid state, and that any excavations below that depth would immediately endanger the banks above—It was necessary therefore to regulate for the present the depth in the canal, as well as that at the different narrows to be improved, by this fact, though I am inclined to the opinion that as the weight of the earth placed on the banks is felt below, a greater depth may be obtained—hereafter—if otherwise it may be necessary to face the canal & the Talbot narrows with palmetto logs before a passage for steam boats or vessels of any magnitude can be effected at common half tide—By the improvements which will be completed under my agency; boats of the largest class may pass at common half tide and Wessels of 30 or 40 tons may without difficulty pass through at low tide—
I have made a contract with M Kingsley to complete the Canal, deepen the creek with which it communicates; and face its mouth with a stockade of palmetto logs so as to prevent the formation of sand bars from the operation of the tides; remove the sand bars from Talbot Narrows, and remove the shell obstructions at the Sisters for the appropriation 13,500 dollars—At the time of concluding the contract I did not advert to the fact of exceeding the appropriation by emolument; but as this will be inconsiderable, provision can be made, I presume, before the completion of the work—If otherwise and you would prefer my doing so: there will be no difficulty in omitting the work at Talbot narrows untill further appropriations can be obtained for the more permanent removal of the obstruction at that & other points-

I pay the Contractor for work only as it is completed and inspected, and as he has had a large force employed for upwards to two months, he reports to me that the canal forming the connection between Pine Island Creek & Amelia Sound will be ready for inspection by the 1
week in august, so that some time in that month you may calculate on a draft for the amount of that portion of the work I shall before the meeting of Congress furnish you with a more detailed report on what has been done & on what may still be further done for the improvement of the inland navigation between the S'
Marys & St Johns rivers"—

The instructions given to Post Masters are, that all letters shall be sent to the post office to which they are directed by the writers, and there detained for delivery, unless the P. M. is instructed by the person to whom they are directed to forward them to another office; and in such case, it is his duty to forward them accordingly. This is the only rule which will give to persons the control of their own correspondence. The Gov' of Florida might intend to visit Pensacola, or

for other reasons he might choose to have letters sent to Pensacola for him; but if the P. M. at Pensacola should forward them to Tallahassee without the Governors instruction, he would frustrate the design.
His proper course then would be, to drop a line to the governor informing him of the receipt of letters at his office, & ask his instruction concerning them.

<place-time>MONTICELLO July 21" 1829</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have received your note of the 16" Ult" and since my letters of the 15" & 20th of May *" your letter of the 24" of April * to which

I shall reply very soon. In the mean time I take leave to say that the question as to the principles involved in the case of Arredondo &
son was one exclusively for the consideration of the late administration. The Report of the Commissioners had been several years in the Department and it was their duty & their right so long as the Constitution confided the execution of the laws to their discretion to see whether my view of the case corresponded with the facts. The question presented by me in my letter of the 14" of August * is in my opinion the only point on which the validity of the title depends & is the only one I ever intended, or ever shall argue before the Court.
I have received a letter from the District Atto of East Florida in which he makes the following extract from a letter of yours to him
“Mr Wirt has requested me to furnish you with a debate in Congress on the subject of British claims. This debate I have not been able to obtain, but Mr White ought unquestionably and by his own admission to have furnished you with all the information in his power on the subject of British claims.” The debate here refered to was one in which I had the principal participation in opposition to the British claims, & the newspaper containing it was sent to the Editor of the Gazette in St Augustine by me and published and if the District Atto has not seen it it is not to be attributed to my neglect. I requested him last fall when I went to East Florida and have since written to him to notify me as soon as any British claim should be filed & that I
would give my personal attention to it. I am now informed that a number are presented, as well as conflicting Spanish & British titles between individuals, & although the government are not directly, they are indirectly interested in the issue. I shall go to St Augustine to the November Court and attend to them.” The debate refered to was mentioned by me in your office on the morning of its publication, & I
asked you to read it. However much some persons here and elsewhere, may be disposed now to undervalue my services I do not hesitate to say that if it had not been for the Report drawn by me, and the debate commenced by me that the U States on the principle established in Mississippi on the subject of British claims would have sustained a loss of more than a million of acres of land. I assure you sir, that whatever may be the views of those who compose the present government & whatever representations may have been made to them, I
shall honestly & faithfully fulfil my engagements as I have always done to the satisfaction of those who may be interested. The late See ante, p. 55.

officers appointed here are almost without an exception, personal and political opponents of mine, with whom I have but little intercourse, and judgeing from the past I have every reason to apprehend that every effort will be made to injure me at Washington. I have to request that as an act of justice, if any representations are made, that before they are made the foundation of letters to District Attorneys in which my conduct may be implicated or indirectly censured that I may be informed of it.
The construction I placed on my contract was one which in my opinion both the spirit, & letter, as well as the understanding with the late President warranted; on this subject however I do not desire to say more at this time. I shall do the duties according to your construction & the government may consider it the performance of the old engagement, but I shall consider it a service never stipulated to be performed by me, & if Congress shall entertain the same opinion I
shall look to them for an adequate renumeration.*

Indisposition has prevented their completion (on the part of M*

I most sincerely hope that some congressional provision will be had before entering on the Surveys East, that will compel the claimants to shew their Lands, and enable the Surveyors to progress regularly with their work; and not produce such a scene of difficulty, and almost ruin, which the Surveys West have exhibited-te-the-Deputies imposed upon them, and the accumulated labour to this Office—I am pur-

suaded that time will ultimately be gained by the delay which may arise by in awaiting the decision of Congress on the private claims and the passing of a declaratory act compelling the Claimants to shew their lands; after due notice from this Office or otherwise the land will to be surveyed as public domain—Under such a course; a system of instructions can be made for the Government of the Deputies as will enable them to perform their duties, correctly and speedily & without vexatious delays, and to the entire fulfilment of the laws & instructions from your Department—Those Surveys which have been executed under all the difficulties which have been presented will I trust meet your entire approbation; but I regret to say have yielded nothing but labour to the Deputies who executed them-

Territory of Florida County of Monroe TO HIS EXCELLENCY A JACKSON President of the U States.
SIR. There is a grievance & Subvertion of the law practiced in this region of our government, of which I feel in duty bound to represent to your excellency. I consider it an erie which concerns and strikes at the very root of one of the greatest priviledges excercised by freemen—I allude to the Conduct of John Jackson Esqr. Commander of the Revenue Cutter Marion on this Station.
At the election for a delegate to Congress held at Indian Key in this C° on the first monday of May last, Capt. J Jackson permitted his two Lieutenants Messr" Day” & Harby "to go on shore from the Cutter under his command with most of the crew of said Cutter for the purpose of voting. Eighteen of whom did, & the two Lieutenants I have been credibly informed that several of the men belonging to

said Cutter declined voting in consequence of Lieu" Harby requiring their vote for Col J M White when it was their wish to vote for Co.'
James Gadsden—By a law of the U States approved the third of March Eighteen hundred & twenty three, “To amend an Act for the establishment of a territorial government in Florida,” "it is enacted
“that Soldiers of the U States shall not be entitled to vote.” I
am not at present prepared to say that men serving on board of U States revenue vessels are soldiers, nor should I like to say so, but tis my opinion they are embraced under that head, so far as it respects elections I would further represent to your excellency that at the Election for a member of the Legislative council held at this place on the first Monday of June last Capt. J Jackson permitted his two Lieutenants and the crew of the Cutter under his command to come on shore for the purpose of voting—The men offered to vote but was refused that priveledge by the Inspector of the Election—After much wrangling between the two Lieutenants and the Inspectors, they took their men from the Poles, disguised them in the garb of common sailors, sent them back, and most of their votes passed before the cheat was discovered.
I am well aware it is an evil which your Excellency cannot easily avert, but I feel I do my duty in representing what I consider improper conduct in officers of the general government.
I would further draw your excellencys attention to the Circumstance of Capt Jacksons making a packet vessel of the U States Revenue Cutter Pulaski, by his going to Havanna to look for & bring a Spanish claimant for a prize brig that was undergoing adjudication at this place, the doing of which he knew Would be of serious injury to Citizens of the U States. He was aware that if some claimant, other than his two Lieutenants Messrs Day & Harby who had libelled the brig for salvage (in consequence of their having slept on board of her as Revenue officers) did not appear she would be given up, & fall into the possession of citizens of the United States who had legal claims against her.
In coroboration of the above statements I enclose Certificates from some of our most Respectable inhabitants.
Finally I would represent to your excellency that if officers & sailors of the Revenue & Navy are allowed to vote, they can at any election on the sea coast, return representatives who are not the choice of the people, who are the actual resident citizens—I would enclose certificates that the persons who have given certificates concerning the conduct of Capt. Jackson and his two Lieutenants Messrs Day &

Harby were the Inspectors of said elections, but it will be unnecessary as Tho" Easton Esq from this place will be in Washington City before this reaches your excellency & can attest to the facts.

The undersigned members of the Volunteer Corps, “Florida Guards” being appointed a Comitee for the purpose, respectfully represent, that in order to insure permanency in the Establishment of that Company, it is desireable that it be provided by the Goverment with a Suitable Stand of Arms & that your Excellency will be pleased to cause an application to be made to that effect To the propper Authorities in behalf of the Company. Some of the reason which have weight in the estimation of the Company & of its Comitee in making the request are these 1" the absolute necessity of having the Company provided with Arms & Acoutrements alike without a uniformity in the arms, the Manuel & accompanying exercise cannot be as perfectly acquired as with it, the Company is bound by its Constitution to uniform itself in the Article of dress, but it would be attended with great difficulty & expense to require it to apply the Same rule to Arms, Many, we may say the Majority of our Members, have not the ability to meet such an expense, in addition to that required. in the provision of even the most economical dress. many have Guns or Fowling pieces of Some Sort, which do not answer the purpose of Drilling, they will reluctantly purchase others more suitable while they have any thing which can be Substituted, the consequence of obliging the members to purchase Muskets & Accoutrements, would be the withdrawal of such as have not the ability to comply, endangering the prosperity
& permanency of the Company. 2dly we would respectfully suggest to Your Excellency the expediency of Maintaining a well disciplined Company upon this part of our unprotected Sea Cost, & but a short distance removed from a race of men, who though at present on terms of perfect Amity with us, Yet look with a Keen eye of Jealousy upon the Fair Country which they once inhabited, & would no doubt be

glad to inhabit again, recent indications as communicated through the medium of the publick prints have placed this suggestion in a palpable light & leave at least some room for apprehension the encouragement therefore that may be given to those disposed to unite in the formation of Volunteer Companies would if so extended, operate not only as a stimulus to their perfection but as an incitement to the whole community to be organized & Armed for any emergency that may occur, & such encouragement we doubt not will be considered by Your Excellency as desireable & worthy of Your recomendation to the Authorities of the General Goverment—and lastly in the most respectful manner we would refer to the example furnished by Goverment in relation to the volunteer companies of other Sections of the Union a part in each State being provided with arms at the publick expense; this being among the first application for such an object within our Teritory—we trust that being urged by Your Excellency upon the Grounds suggested or others which may occur to You, its prayer will be readily granted. The number Composing the Company is at present about forty five,that number will be gradually increasing, The law of the Teritory provides for the number which shall constitute a Volunteer Corps. & would therefore prescribe the number of Arms requisite The Company have adopted the Infantry dress & exercises, Any Security that may be required from the Officers for the careful preservation of the arms & for their safe return when called for will be cheerfully given We have the honor to be Your Obt Svts Signed W* L HASKINS Capt EDW'd KLEIN 1st Lieut L W BURNET 2."

SIR, I hand you enclosed herewith, an order assigning you to the post of St: Augustine Florida.”—
Besides the current duties of the Department, which you will assume on your arrival at that place, you will have confided to you, the superintendence of the construction of the bridge, now in progress, * Dated Aug. 18, 1829 (NA, WD, AGO Order Bk. 1, QMG Special Order No.

across the St: Sebastian River, and the repair of the Military road between St: Augustine and Tallahassee. I enclose you a Copy of a contract * which has been concluded for the first named object, and it will remain for you, by a rigid supervision of the operations of the Contractor to see that the work conform thereto.—
It is desirable that you should, as early as practicable, examine the road from St. Augustine to Tallahassee, in order to determine on the nature and extent of repairs to be bestowed upon it, and make the necessary arrangements to have them effected. The sum appropriated for this object is three thousand dollars, which you will be careful not to transcend. If the amount at disposal, be inadequate to effect a repair of the whole road, it will be applied as far as it will go towards that object.—It is however very desirable that the road should be put in good travelling order throughout the whole distance, if the appropriation can be made to effect it in a proper manner.—I
shall cause the amount appropriated to be remitted to you—and you may apply a portion of it to the current service to be reimbursed by a remittance on account of the Quarter Master's Department when it shall be required for the road."—

SIR, Your communication of the 12" inst * has been attentively considered—
Your having declined to undertake the direction of the contemplated improvement of the Harbour of S’ Marks would be subject of regret were it not for the hope that you may be yet induced to undertake it—If a contract for effecting the improvement could not be made advantageously and it should become necessary to carry it on by means to be procured and applied on behalf of the Government the employment of a person to act as the immediate Superintendent, under your direction, would relieve you of the necessity of giving your personal attention to the work except occasionally when it might be convenient and would not materially interfere with the attention necessary to be given to your private concerns—If such an arrangement would be acceptable to you it would be satisfactory to the

Department and would be more advantageous to the public interest, than any other arrangement that could be made at this time—If it is agreeable to you the arrangements for giving effect to it may be made whenever you think it most advisable and the necessary funds will be furnished upon your requisition—If it be done by Contract the Contractor will of course provide any machinery or other facilities that may be necessary but if not done by contract it is considered that you are authorized to provide them—Perhaps the dredging machine which has been used for deepening the Channel at Mobile might be procured on very low terms if there is no further use for it—
The person by whom it was built, Mr John Grant of Baltimore, furnished one for Sacketts Harbour for $2300 capable of raising from any depth not exceeding 12 feet, twelve tons per hour of sand, mud or gravel—It had a Steam Engine of one horse power which used
1/20" of a cord of wood per hour and it required the attendance of One man-
If your private affairs will not allow of your undertaking the Agency in question on the footing which has been explained, will you be good enough to recommend to the Department a person with whom it may be intrusted and advise the Department of the rate of compensation which it would be proper to allow and which would be accepted"—

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE September 3" 1829</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. I have this day returned from the Appalachicola,” where I
had gone for the purpose of resuming the clearing out of the River;
but the water is so high, that there is no possibility of working on it;
nor from appearence will there, probably, be during the present month.
This makes the 4" time during this summer that I have gone to the river to remove the obstructions; viz, in the months of May, June, July and August; and and have been obliged to return from the same cause. About the latter end of the present month or beginning of next, the water will, I hope, be low enough to resume operations.
The Account of disbursements and expenditures stands thus at the present time: viz.
Expense of Reconnoissance $95.00
Work and labor at the river of sticks 600.00
one keel Boat 450.00
Blocks & tackel chains cables &ca &c &c 200.00
$1345.00

All of which items will be presented with their proper vouchers and requisite forms at when the return of the work is made by me to the Department.
I have not yet drawn the last remittance of $1500 placed to my credit in the Branch Bank of the U.S. at New Orleans, now will I
do so, until the work is in a greater state of forwardness. If the River continues too high on the first week of October, it is supposed that it will not fall any lower after that period during the present season. In consequence of the work done at the river Sticks, and the high stage of the water, the navigation has been unimpeded since January last, and the beneficial results to the trade & commerce of the river have been sensibly felt.
I will report again next month.”

<source>[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:DS *]</source>
<place-time>[September 13, 1829]</place-time>
<docbody>Memorial to the Hon: the Congress of the United States.
The memorial of the subscribers respectfully represent that they are masters and owners of vessels engaged and employed in affording assistance to other vessels which by accident or misfortune get aground on the reef and numerous shoals & rocks with which the coast of Florida abound, and for which assistance they expect no other remuneration than what may be adjudged by the proper tribunals of their Country. They cherfully concede that the courts have invariably manifested a disposition to do justice in all cases, and to all parties concerned.
But we humbly beg leave to remark that there are many instances which do, and must occur wherof from the peculiar circumstances connected with the case we are debar'd from that compensation to which we are justly entitled.—The remedy can be furnished only by your honorable body, and for this we humbly pray.
It sometimes happens that foreign vessels and vessels from foreign ports are driven ashore on the reef, shoals & Rocks before mentioned;
and from their situation cannot be relieved without the aid and assistance derived from the Wreckers, which has been at all times hazardous, tho'—promptly extended—That proper salvage may be determined on, -it is necessary to take the vessel saved to some port, where the amount allowed, is upon the appraised value of the Cargo—which, when named, may, to those who have never examined, and made themselves acquainted with the subject, appear fully sufficient:
nevertheless, when all the circumstances attending are explained, proves totally inadequate—For when the duties required by law are paid, the sum is so reduced as to afford nothing like a reasonable compensation; and there have been many instances of property found derelict, and totally abandoned, which was saved at great labor and difficulty, not yielding one cent to the salvors, in consequence of the heavy duties to which they were liable, and which for the future, under existing circumstances, we will be compell'd to abandon, unless relieved in some manner or mode devised by your honorable body, to insure some reasonable compensation, for goods wares & merchandize thus situated, the duties on which, equal or exceeding the value of the article.—We therefore pray that when goods wares and merchandise

liable to duties, be saved, by any regular wrecking vessel, that such part which may be adjudged for salvage, be exempt from the payment of any duty; or at least, an equal percentage from the duties accruing to the Government from that portion awarded the salvors, as may be awarded in the aggregate of the Cargo. In requiring this, (which we deem equitable and just) we will presume to remind your honorable body, that were it not for our exertions, the great revenue now derived by Gov' from wrecked property would be entirely lost, —and for meritorious services thus rendered at the risk of our property &
lives, attended with great labor, we consider ourselves entitled to a due reward.
Your memorialists further beg leave to represent in behalf of their petition that they have provided vessels of a superior class, and of a construction admirably calculated for their occupation, and such as will enable them to afford assistance, when ever the same is practicable. In doing this we have been compelled to expend our means;
and are moreover, subjected to great expence in maintaining the crews employed; and are likewise exposed to daily hazard of loosing our property, while engaged in saving that of others.—We also respectfully suggest that notwithstanding impressions abroad, there is no business, where the remuneration is so uncertain as that of wreckers, as it is not unusual for vessels to cruise a year without meeting any employment-
Your memorialists further represent that the provisions of the law of Congress " requiring each wrecking vessel to have a licence from the Judge of the Superior Court ef Admiralty excludes those from the occupation who are not of a respectable character, and we appeal to the court of Admiralty at Key West, and every other respectable inhabitant of that place whether our conduct has not on all occasions been distinguished for humanity to those in distress; or therebe, a single instance, where they have not acted with fairness, and fulfill'd every duty incumbent on them: and before closing our petition we will advert to the fact, that there has not been a single life lost by Wrecks on the Coast of Florida since its session to the United States;
but on the contrary several lives have been lost among those engaged in saving the lives and property ef ethers from Wrecked vessels whilst actually engaged in saving the lives their humane and laudable efforts to save others.
Relying on the equity and justice of your honorable body we pray for such relief only as may be just and proper.—

<docbody>GENTLEMEN, I enclose for your information, a copy of the surveys of the public Lands in the vicinity of the Barrancas and the Navy Yard, at the entrance of Pensacola Bay.
The tracts coloured yellow, are represented as private claims but it is understood that the titles to all of them, with the exception of that numbered 6. and confirmed in the name of William P. Anderson, have been purchased up by the Navy Dept. It is also understood that the claim of F. S. Pintardo * to a tract of land at the West End of St Rose Island, and which was rejected by the Board of Comm"
has been bought up also, thro’ M White, by the Navy Department.
I would therefore suggest the propriety of reserving, for the present, for the use of the Navy Dept. and for military purposes, all the Lands on the East side of the Bay of Pensacola, which lie West of the East boundary of Fractional Township 2 South, Range 28 West, and all the Lands on the West side of Pensacola Bay, included in Fractional Town: 3. South, Range 30. West, and so much of Fractional Town:

claim of W. P. Anderson for 626,15/100 Arpens.—the reservation on the West of the Bay, includes 4.174 Acres.
Should the soil of the whole or any portion of these Lands prove on experiment to be capable of growing Live-oak fit for naval purposes, the position of them would make it desirable that the whole quantity proposed should be permanently retained.

Brown, the former agent, Your Memorialists respectfully solicit, that the old road, made by the English Government, may be cleared, and repaired, and Bridges built across the

<place-time>KEY WEST, 9 October 1829</place-time>
<docbody>HON: SAMUEL D. INGHAM, Secy of the Treasury:
SIR, I have been informed by Henry Wilson Esquire, late Marshal of the United States for the Southern district of Florida, that some objection has been made to the settlement of his accounts for repairs

done to the Court house at this place, in consequence of his not having received direct authority to make them, and he has requested me to state the circumstances which led to the expenses incur'd by him for those repairs.
When I reach'd this Island, I was informed that a house which had originally been intended for a Naval Hospitality had been given up by the then Secretary of the Navy to the State department for the purpose of having it used as a Court house; but upon an examination of its situation, it was found wholly unfit for use without considerable alteration and repairs. It had never been finished, & was nothing more than a shell when M. Wilson received it; besides which, it leaked badly, was surrounded by an almost impenetrable thicket of underwood, and was altogether in a ruinous condition.
It has always (so far as I am informed) been considered a part of the duty of the Marshals of the U. S. Courts, to provide & furnish rooms for holding the Courts when none have been provided by the Government; & the expenses incur'd in doing so have in all cases, I
believe, been allowed in the settlement of their accounts. Without the performance of this duty it would in many instances be impossible to hold the Courts; & believing that there could be no difficulty on such a subject, & indeed, that the Marshal of this district was bound to do acts so essentially important, I requested him soon after our arrival, to cause the necessary arrangements to be made for the transaction of business.
Under these circumstances, & taking into view the fact that the Hospital had been turned over to him for that express purpose, he deemed it his duty to cause such alterations & repairs to be made in that building as were absolutely necessary to make it answer the end for which it was intended.
In making this alteration & repairs, I believe he had an eye to the most rigid oeconomy, but from the high price of labor & the difficulty of procuring materials, the accounts may have been swelled to an extent beyond his expectations; of this much however, I am certain, that under the circumstances by which he was surrounded, he could not have made the building answer the purpose at a less expense than he incur'd, & it is yet far from being as convenient & comfortable as could be wished.
I have the Honor to be, very Respectfully, Yr. most Obd" Serv"

<place-time>KEY WEST 14th October 1829 (E. Florida)</place-time>
<docbody>HON: JN° BRANCH Secy of the Navy, SIR, You will doubtless recollect that we had a conversation, &
subsequently I had a more particular one with Col. Clark of your department in Norfolk relative to the pub. property belonging to your

dep" at this place, which terminated, with a request that I would communicate my views on the subject.
Upon my arrival here Maj. Wilson (my predecessor) had left the Island, consequently I cannot give any satisfactory information relative to its disposition heretofore; tho’ the result of my inquires are, that the houses were rented last year generally at a high price in consequence of the scarcity then, and a particular Spirit of competition at the time: whether the rents have been collected &" &°, I am unable to say farther than I have understood that one of the proprietors claimed ground rent, but all of the circumstances I presume, are filed in your office.
The Houses erected on this Island by the diferent Naval Officers of the West India station consisted of a Hospital, Comodores quarters with several small Houses, a ware House, sail loft &"
The House erected for a Hospital has been fited up for and is now occupied as a court House, with Clerks and Marshal's Offices; and those for the commandants quarters, are now, and I believe have been, since the establishment of this as a port of entry, occupied by the Collector: The residue are now unocupied and going fast to decay;
the Court House is within the pub. square ie the “donation lot;”
the balance are all on private land claims which makes it the more necessary that they should be disposed of immediately. —I have conversed with one of the proprietors Col. P. C. Green, now on the Island who assures me that a reasonable time shall be allowed for their removal by the purchasers, the sale of which, under existing circumstances, I would advise; tho' what ever instructions you may think proper to give me, shall be strictly attended to.”
With due deference allow me, Sir, to avail myself of the present oportunity to impress on your mind the urgent necessity of some more effectual provision, than the present; being made at this port for our destitute mariners. Since my short residence on this Island I have witnessed more human misery, than I had ever expected to see within the United States.
There are probably four or five hundred Mariners engaged on this coast wrecking and fishing, (who like all other sailors, (I believe it a characteristic trait) are remarkable for their improvidence and reckless disregard of future events. Those engaged in the wrecking

business sometimes receive several hundred dollars as prize money, which they usually spend in riotous dissipation, and whilst doing so, they contract the malignant diseases peculiar to this climate, which will not admit of disipation or exposure.—I have no hesitation in asserting my belief that a number of those destitute creatures have died for want of the most ordinary assistance!—The few inhabitants on this Island, who were able, have extended relief as far as they could, but which was necessarily limited as they received no assistance from the hospital fund of this place, that having been expended, long since; and in a manner that afforded no (Comparative) Relief,-for want of a regular established hospital, physician and nurses.—surely our Government is able, and no doubt are willing when properly advised, to provide for her destitute mariners.—I believe they are considered in all civilized countries as proper subjects for guardianship, which is evidenced by the exactions of Hospital money &"—I
trust you will pardon me if I have addressed you on a subject with which you have no official control or influence, but the impressions left on my mind (in the absence of all reference) are, that the act of Congress (I think of 1811) makes some provision for all naturalized seamen of the United States, and leaving it measurably discretionary with the sec' of the Navy, when, and where, to establish a hospital, and in the event of that particular fund being inadequate, he is req"
to report, upon which congress will make a special appropriation from the Treasury of the United States to supply the deficiency.” Beleiving this to be the law, (in substance) I am induced to address you;—
tho' should I be laboring under erroneous impressions relative to its provisions, I well know you will excuse the motives that induced me to trouble you, and that you will cherfully aid in your private or public character in making some future provision for the object contemplated, in the absence of any present.
The House belonging to your Dep', occupied at present by the Collector of this place, is well calculated for a Hospital, and I have no doubt but the proprietors would dispose of the lot and suitable grounds, on very reasonable terms for so laudable a a purpose. Any further information, or assistance that I can render, will be freely given.
I have the honor to be With great respect Your Obt Serv"

<docbody>GEN' I have the honor to enclose herewith my accounts and vouchers for disbursements in opening the Road from Pensacola to Blakely.—Although all the economy possible, and all diligence in carrying on the work, has been practised. Yet the whole of the Appropriation has been necessarily expended in opening the Road to Blakely, Contrary to my expectations, for I expected there would have been a part applicable to opening the Road to Mobile Point But I have found in this case, as in all others of a similar character where no exact data can be had to base estimates on, that the expense of a work is more easily calculated at the close than at the Commencement of it.—By reason of shortening the Road in Crossing many heads of Branches there was tenfold more work necessary in Bridges and Causeways than I had anticipated, well acquainted as I was with the Country generally.—Moreover the Road has been opened in a very different manner from what I first contemplated.—It is laid out in straight reaches, each extending as far on the same line as the Country would allow of, and the Stumps of the trees cut down into the ground so that a carriage wheel can run directly on to and over them without jolting or inconvenience.—In fact it is made as well as a Road can be without being turnpiked; and is so laid out and opened that it will I
am confident be both useful and permanent. Of the first 30 miles from Pensacola eight miles are opened 32 feet wide—22 miles are then on an average of 20 feet in width; and the remainder of it being through the more open Pine Barren, is 18 feet wide.—The whole entirely cleared of all Stumps and Logs, or any other cause of interruption whatever. The appropriation having been exceeded $2.11/100
I have in order to Balance and close the Road account charged that sum in my Quarterly Acc" Curr" on Acc" of Q M* Dept. in Settling which I trust it will be allowed as a charge, being so trifling in amount, upon the appropriation on acc” of Q M* Dept.—The only expense incurred by the U. States for my Superintendance is my Acc" for transpo. of baggage $23.40/100 as charged in voucher N° 54. of Abstract B. in Accts: on acc” of Q M Dept.—Same Quarter with this.
In closing this letter I beg leave respectfully to state as my opinion that in a Military point of view Roads should be opened, so soon as an Appropriation can be obtained from Pensacola to Mobile Point, and from Mobile Point to Blakely, and more especially the first named Road.—From my perfect knowledge of these Routes and of the Country through which they will pass I think that I can say

confidently that $5000, will effect both objects in opening Routes connecting those places by Roads as good and permanent as that just completed to Blakely.

<docbody>GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON Pres. of the United States of America Washington SIR Acting as a Committee appointed by at a meeting of the Citizens of Alachua County for the purpose of communicating with the General Government concerning the helpless and unprotected condition in which the Inhabitants are left, in relation to the Indians, by the removal of the garrison from Fort King, we beg leave to hand a memorial signed by its citizens.
Your good sense will no doubt enable you readily to perceive from the tenor of this memorial the necessity which exists, of our being protected by an adequate force, and that too promptly; for already has report reached us, tho’ not yet properly confirmed, that a family of the name of Howard have been butchered at Suwanney Old Town by the Indians—They are moreover buying up all the powder they can get at unusually high prices

It may be proper to mention that our settlements are scattered from the northern boundary line of the Seminoles to the Suwanney and S’ Marys River. From the manner in which the settlements are generally located, the junction of the males of any two families at the house of either would leave entirely exposed the property and family of the other—From this you may conclude what would be the consequence if all the men were ordered out; Our force would be too weak to permit its being divided, so that it could be efficient but at one point at the same moment—while the rest of the county, through which would be scattered their respective families, would be without the smallest shadow of protection. And what must be the result of this fact? Why, that in a case of danger every man will be compelled to remain at home to protect to the best of his ability with his single arm, the objects most dear to him, thus leaving it in the power of an enemy to cut us off peicemeal, or as it were, in detail, with little or no hazard to themselves.
The only remedy for this state of circumstances which presents itself to our view, is that proposed in the memorial above referred to.—to wit. That a garrison of four companies of United States troops be stationed at Micanopia in this county—By this means whenever an alarm occured, the Inhabitants from every part of the County would flock to it with their families, and having deposited them thus in a place of safety, would be unburthened of his cheif care, and be then ready to fight the battles of his country. Which would be rendered more effectual, by the power, which the adoption of this plan would afford of cooperating with the regular forces.
These advantages were not afforded by the station at Fort King—
being located so far within the boundaries, that in time of war, no man would have risqued his family through an anemy's country to have reached; while it had but little power of restraining the Indians from roaming at large in the Territory of the whites, for from their situation it was rendered troublesome to send detachments among us—
and when such detachments were sent, they could stay but so short a time that the Indians had it in their power to conceal themselves until the danger was past, without the least possibility of detection.
Micanopia is situated about twenty five miles north of the Agency—
and thirty East of the Suwanney Old Town—it is well watered—a high and healthy situation. The land carriage to the S Johns would be between forty and fifty miles—one half the distance that was required for the delivery of the stores at Fort King, until shortly before their removal—nor will the cost of the Beef and grain required for their consumption amount to half the expence which was found necessary for its obtainment at that station.

The situation of Micanopia is such that with all ease and convenience detachments might be constantly kept on duty, which will be the only possible means of keeping the Indians within their boundary and of putting a stop to their depredations—while in time of danger it would be of easy access to all parts of the country—
Again—with regard to the arms requested to be sent among us.
We stand sir in actual need of them. There are not more in our opinions than one Tenth of our men who could bring into action guns proper to be used there. Besides which our Regiment is almost universally desirous of forming into volunteer uniformed companies, which are generally the most efficient arm of the milita, being better disciplined, but are prevented from doing so, by their being unable to obtain regular arms—there being but few public arms at the seat of Government.
The major part of the force at present stationed at Tampa Bay might with propriety be removed to this part of the Country—at Tampa they are of little use or benefit, which will appear to you by a reference to the map of this country We might enlarge, Sir, our views to a considerable extent on the subject on which we have the honor of adressing you, but have concluded that, in resigning the matter, with the few remarks above submitted, yet r entirely to your own good judgement, we shall have no reason to fear its reception of proper attention—Yet permit us, Sir, to add one remark—That we are an integral part of the citizens of the United States, and stand in need of protection from the General Govern".
We have the Honor to be Sir With the highest esteem Your fellow citizens JAMES DELL

Inhabitants of Alachua County to the President
[No date, 1829]
GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON, President of the United States of America We, the Undersigned, Inhabitants of the County of Alachua, in East Florida, beg leave Respectfully to represent, That we regret the necessity of being again compelled to call the attention of the General Government to the subject of the Florida Indians.
Scarcely three years has elapsed since some of our peaceable Inhabitants were butchered by these savages. without respect to age or sex. and altho' their hostility was soon subdued, their depredations

on our property and lawless conduct have been continued from time to time.
We have repeatedly complained to the proper authorities of the Territory—of the impropriety of many of the priveledges granted to these people; but we are sorry to say without effect. Our situation at present is alarming, and rendered still more so by a leave of absence for six months which we are sorry to learn has been granted the Agent. Within a few days parties of them have been detected in the fact of plundering our stock, in the very heart of our settlements, and fifty or sixty miles beyond their boundary.
About four weeks since a deputation from the Creek Nation visited these Indians—their business unknown, but certain it is, that their conduct while here was calculated to produce alarm. Since which time we have been informed that a party of one or two hundred of them have come among the Seminoles, and still remain there. We have further, from the Acting Agent M. Sims, information that the chiefs of the Seminoles were to hold a Council, for what object unknown, and that their deportment is hostile.
For the protection of our frontiers, and to quell the fears of the people, we would beg leave Respectfully to request that a garrison of four Companies of U. S. Troops be stationed at Micanopia, in this County. Tho' we admit that the company recently stationed at Fort King had its influence, yet in case of difficulty their efforts to check the Indians would have been of little avail being twelve miles within the boundary, and affording no possibility of protection to our families, or of co-operation with our militia.
We would beg leave further to request That, One Thousand stand of Arms with ammunition, may be sent to the Col. of the sixth Regiment of the Florida militia, in this county, to be distributed to those who may not be supplied with arms.
All which we respectfully submit to your consideration.

<source>[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:ALS]</source>
<place-time>ST AUGUSTINE District of East Florida 18 Nov. 1829.</place-time>
<docbody>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SIR, I have recently been informed by William Levinston, a present resident of this city, who has lately returned from a visit at Washington, that while there he had the honour of a personal interview with the President, and that on that occasion he learnt that a memorial had been received by you from Joseph S Sanchez, containing complaints or charges against me as Judge of this District.”
It is painful to me Sir, that complaints should be preferred against me from any source, whatever may be its character, or however unfounded the complaints may be—it is far more so, when it is feared they have made unfavourable impressions against me on your mind.
But I rely Sir, on your justice, and on a consciousness of having acted on all occasions in my judicial capacity with great care, and with the strictest fidelity; and I do believe that a plain and true statement, which I am able now to make, with such documents as the suddenness of the occasion will permit me to collect, must change the unkind sentiments, which this Mr. Levinston boasts you entertain in regard to me, and convince you that misrepresentation and cruel calumny have been practised to do me the greatest injury.
So far as I could learn from Mr. Levinston, the complaint had relation principally to a judicial proceeding against Rafael D. Fontané, José Elzaurdi and Joseph S. Sanchez—and perhaps also, to two several occurrences that took place, the first in 1824, almost six years ago, where a person by the name of Coe was concerned, and the other in 1826, nearly four years since, in which a Mr. Cox * was the party—neither of these transactions had any connexion with official duties; still, anxious to avoid difficulty with any person, I sincerely

regretted them, but not from a sense of moral wrong or even want of prudence on my part—for in both instances I was attacked personally, and with great violence, and am not conscious that I was guilty of any fault, unless it be so to defend myself. I speak of these transactions with the more reluctance, because both of the persons have been some time dead—and both of them, before that event, exonerated me from blame, told me their feelings were not unfriendly, and the latter especially, that he had been instigated by others, and not actuated by his own feelings in the attack upon me: that such was the fact, as to the complaint made by M. Coe, no one here, I
believe ever doubted. I attended Sir, the dying bed of the one—and contributed, before his death, to relieve the necessities of the other:
no unkind recollection rests on my mind respecting them, and I cannot therefore now willingly, even in my own defence, utter a reflection on either. But the circumstances I have stated, show the unworthy motives of the complainant, in making these matters, at this time, a ground of imputation against me, more especially, when among the files of the House of Representatives, or in the Office of State, a document may be found with the volunteered signature of this very complainant, joined with that of almost every individual of his community, testifying in the strongest terms to my merits, with a view to this very transaction in which M. Coe was concerned, at a time during my absence from the district, when it was understood, it had been made a subject of secret accusation against me.
I need only add, that the evidence relating to it, was submitted at an early period, both to the President of the United States, and to the Judiciary committee of the House, and by neither was my conduct deemed blame-worthy.
As to the affair with M Cox, it has never, unless at the present moment, been a ground of complaint against me, M Cox having I believe uniformly, since it happened, exonerated me from blame, and repeatedly declared that I could not have acted on the occasion, otherwise than I did.
I will pass from these subjects, to that which I understand has been the chief cause of the complaint, the Judicial proceeding against the complainant and against Rafael Fontanë and José Elzaurdi already mentioned. This Sir, is a recent transaction, and I can have no difficulty in completely evincing its character. The documents herewith transmitted prove an outrage committed by these persons, in grossness and daring violation of Law and decency, rarely equalled in any country, and which in this district none could have been found sufficiently irresponsible and destitute of moral restraint, but themselves, to have practised.

They also show a forbearance, and discrete exercise of my authority as a magistrate, which I truly believe, when known, You Sir, will applaud. It will be seen, that I was careful to call to my aid the respectable magistrates of the county and city—to advise with them, and that from their advice, I deviated in no particular—that the delinquents were mildly dealt with, and where there was doubt, the most lenient course pursued—and under the circumstances, I may be pardoned in adding, that I was dispassionate, even where passion might have been expected and excused—that my duty as a magistrate was discharged in a manner strictly legal and according to precedent, where error would not have been just cause for accusation, and that my conduct was entitled to, and received the decided approbation of all the moral and respectable people of this community.
These documents Sir, while they prove the correctness of my own, as conclusively establish the misconduct of the complainant, and the bad motives by which he has been governed in his accusations, whatever they may be, made against me. These motives are further elucidated, by his attempt, disrespectful even to you Sir, to procure a publication of his memorial in the National Telegraph, for the purpose of subjecting me to public odium, at the same time that he transmitted it to you, for your consideration and decision. For the correctness of this assertion, I beg to refer to the Editor of the Gazette named.
I am unwilling Sir, to speak lightly of the character of any person:
but where it is warranted by truth, in self defence I may be justified in saying, that Simeon Sanchez' accusation against me, in this community where he is known, and where it is known that he is wholly reckless of right or wrong, and void of every sort of responsibility, would be esteemed as entitled to the least possible consideration.
Rafael Fontanè his associate, and William Levinston have both been at the seat of Government: S*Augustine has certainly been unfortunate in these representatives—The first name of the first is synonimous with nothing reputable, and since I have been in this country, has never failed, I believe for a single term, to be borne on the criminal docket of the court. How much credit ought to be yielded to the latter in any representation he may have made in regard to me, may be determined by the statement concerning him which accompanies this letter. -
How far persons like these, are to be favoured in complaints which they may chuse to prefer against judicial or other officers, I have no right to say, but I submit Sir, to your discernment, whether they may not be encouraged to an extent, not only grievous and harrassing to the officer, distressing to his family and unjustly injurious to

character—but subversive also, of subordination to the laws and of judicial firmness and independence.
I will not detain you longer Sir, than barely to remark, that I have now been in the district, in my present office, more than seven years.
The peculiar materials, unquiet and discordant, generally marking the population of a new Territory, cannot have escaped your observation—Here, to talent and enterprise, often exhibited, but not as often well regulated, to the mere adventurer, and to persons who have left their former abodes for any cause, is added the remnant of a Spanish people, who I certainly would be the last to reproach, but who, just released from the despotism of Spanish rule, under our free institutions, do not always exhibit a capacity to submit to Laws, whose sanctions, widely different from the arbitrary mandate of a Provincial Governor, rest almost exclusively in the moral sense of the community.
Thus situated, and where the judicial has been the only restraining power, the Territorial Executive influence never having been seen or felt in the district, and where too, this judicial power has been vested in a single Judge, his duty must indeed have been difficult and arduous.
Such Sir has been mine—and during the years passed here, that I
should have escaped without difficulties and without, at times, cavil being excited against me, ought not to have been expected, and would have been inconsistent with the existing state of society. In every part of the Territory difficulties have arisen—Judges have been attacked and abused. In this county Justices and other magistrates, amiable in character, and honest in office, have been attacked contemned and beaten—my accusers, being always on such occasions, conspicuous actors. The same course has been attempted upon me—
and it is now attributed as a fault, that I would not submit to be abused and beaten. I have laboured Sir, in the discharge of my duties, without yielding to fatigue—I have endeavoured to administer the Laws faithfully and impartially—uniformly to support order and peace—to sustain the moral and religious institutions of society—to serve and benefit the people of the district—and though complaints are made against me—I beleive they are from the bad, and from a very small part of our community, and I have the consolation of being assured, from many sources, that the moral, the intelligent, and the respectable, perhaps indeed nine-tenths of all the people of the district, reward these exertions with their esteem and approbation. I
may state these things Sir, without the imputation of arrogance, when under accusation—In other circumstances I should be silent.
I trust Sir, that my communication, and the documents with it, may be received, and be favoured with a candid examination. I
ardently hope they may be satisfactory to you—and I pray Sir, that

whatever disposition may be made of the memorial against me, that these may accompany and be filed with it.
It is my intention to repair to Washington, the moment official duties will admit of my absence from the Territory—but constant terms in the district, followed by the court of Appeals at Tallahassé, demand my time till the middle of January, after which, if further explanation be necessary, I hope I may in person be permitted to make it.
I have the honour to be Sir, with the greatest respect Your obedient Servant JOSEPH L SMITH Judge of the district of East Florida.

by shaking at him in an angry and threatning manner their clinched fists—
And the said Sanchez was guilty of further contempt and outrage against the Court, by openly declaring that “the Judge was a tyrant”
that he had but a short time to remain”—“that he should be put down”, and that he the said Sanchez “would put him down”—
Accompanying these opprobrious charges with violent imprecations and menacing gestures and and also with shaking a Large Cane at the said Judge-

<docbody>TO COL. D. L. CLINCH Comm" 4th Infy Tampa Bay, Florida SIR: The inhabitants of the Peninsula of Florida have represented to the War Department their apprehension that the Indians in that

quarter,” especially the Creeks who visit them occasionally, may be mischeiviously inclined, and that they will materially thereby affect the peace and happiness of the settlement and have requested that a post might be established somewhere in the interior, in order to check the restless disposition evinced by the Indians.—
The Army being already too much broken up into small detachments, it is not considered to be beneficial to incur further expense in the Peninsula of Florida, by the establishment of additional posts there, under present circumstances; but I am instructed by the General in Chief to say to you, that you will consider it your duty, to watch over the interests and peace of the inhabitants of the Peninsula, and that should any interruption of them by the Indians, be reported to you, you will ascertain the fact and protect the inhabitants; but at the same time, will take care to involve no extraordinary expense. The show of a detachment of one company where there may be disorders, will be sufficient to keep the Indians in order should they manifest any disposition to be mischeivous. It is presumed an excursion could be made at any time by a company, lightly armed and equipped for a short tour of service, without any considerable expense, and it is such a movement, which is contemplated as all that will be required to keep peace in the Peninsula and which you are authorsed to make."

<place-time>APPALACHICOLA RIVER Dec 5" 1829.</place-time>
SIR I have the honor to inform the Department that the hands employed under my direction in clearing out and removing the obstructions on the Appalachicola River, are doing well, and we have succeeded in making the river more easily navigable for Steam Boats for the distance of 75 miles from the Bay. As long as the water continues low I shall continue operations, which however, I am afraid will not be longer than the end of this month. We have been at work since the 25" of September, with from 10 to 15 hands, and I have the satisfaction of informing the Department that the navigation has been so far as we have gone, been materially improved. The operations

have been confined principally to that part of the river, called the
“Narrows” and “the river of Sticks.” Freights on the River have diminished one third in price and will no doubt diminish much more the ensuing season, when all the obstructions are removed. I am inclined to think that the present appropriation of $3000, will not be sufficient for the object for which Congress passed the Law.” There will have been paid laid out and expended on the river during the last and present year, on the 25* Instant, about the sum of $2400, leaving an unexpended balance, besides, keel Boats flat Boat chains cables
&a &a of $600: not counting my per diem allowance and percentage.
Now the question is, whether the above sums unexpended, will be sufficient to finish the river. or whether it will be adviseable to go on again next season with only this small sum to expend. or whether it would not be more proper to advise the proper authorities of the fact of this insufficiency in order to obtain another appropriation to complete the object. This then is the object of this letter to the Department. Experience has shown me, altho' I was formerly otherwise of opinion, that the sum of $3000 is not sufficient to carry into complete effect the object of Congress.
It would require about $2000 more to render the river safe for the navigation of steam and other Boats. and I am warranted in saying that the above sum only will compleate it. I refer the Department to his Excellency Gov" Duval for more particular data on this subject.
He will be in Washington about the 1* of Jany next. also to Colonel Joseph M. White Delegate from this Territory for information respecting the necessity and utility of a farther appropriation.”

<docbody>GEN' I have the honor to forward herewith my accounts and vouchers for Expenditures on account of appropriation for repairing Road from Pensacola to Tallahassee."
I had made my calculations when furnishing Provisions to the Working party on the Road, so as to Carry them up to about the 1"
of December; knowing that the expenses must by that time absorb the appropriations; And accordingly drew them off the Road on the sixth Inst—discharged all hands, and closed the accounts.
The Season has been uncommonly fine during the whole time they were at work so that none of the labor of the hands has been lost in consequence of bad weather.—The Road was so much grown up and the Bridges and Causeways so delapidated that the whole had to be entirely renewed.—The Bridges are built of the best materials the Country afforded—the causeways entirely covered with earth—And the whole calculated to stand for some Years, unless in case of extraordinary freshets; And when such occur no kind of work will stand their force.—Every practicable economy was used, and as much work obtained from the hands as could possibly be, by Judicious Management of their labor, but the hands were necessarily withdrawn from

the Road before it was carried into the Settlements of Alagua & the Alagua Creek Bridged;—But there was remaining after closing up the accounts, $145.62/100, which I have turned over to Judge Brackenridge at his request, to be expended in Bridging the Alagua Creek, the receipt for which is filed with my Quarterly account Current.—
He will superintend the construction of the Bridge, and select the Site for its location, which will not be that of the former one on the Military Road; it being necessary to enter the Settlements of Alagua, to deviate from that Road and cross the Creek some miles higher up;
After the Bridge is finished he will furnish me with the necessary receipts for the expenditure of the money in order to my having the necessary credits at the Treas Depart".—
When this Creek is Bridged all that was necessary in the repair of the Road, (having determined to deviate from the old Military Road before reaching the Alagua Creek & cross it at the Settlements, and there terminate the work on the Western end of the Road,)
will have been done; because that part of the Road from Tallahassee Westwardly towards Ocheesee passes through Settlements and is kept in good repair—indeed at the two principal Rivers, Ocholockony and Little River Fall Bridges have been erected by private proprietors.—
No extra expense has been incurred by myself in the Superintendance of this Road, excepting a small account for transportation of baggage for necessary travelling."

<docbody>SIR, By an Act passed in 1826-7" for the settlement & confirmation of private land claims in East Florida it was provided that the holders of claims over 3500 acres should connect their surveys with the Township plats &c—The object of this provision was to prevent the sale of private unsettled claims as public Lands—By the Act of
1828 a certain number of claims were confirmed to the extent of a League Square on certain conditions. It is certainly incontrovertible that as soon as the condition was complied with it became a private confirmed claim & must be surveyed as such—The Surveyor General of Florida however still insists that the claimants must at their own cost & by their own Surveyors still connect the little survey with the Township plats-For what object I cannot immagine—Congress have confirmed their claims & under a general law, providing for the Survey of private confirmed claims they wish their lands surveyd—
I am requested by Henry Michilet of Pensacola to solicit your attention to this subject & to request that instructions may be given for the survey—The claim of Bonal has not yet been surveyd & is in the same neighborhood of that of Michilet & can be surveyed by the same Deputy—It is a matter of great interest to the U States, the Territory & the claimants that these orders be given immediately—

their claims represented on the township maps, and the 1* Section of the act of 23 May 1828,” by which certain of those claims were confirmed to not more than a league square, to be taken by Sections out of the limits of the original grant, makes no additional provisions by which those limits are to be ascertained, and the United States having already paid for surveying the Sectional lines cannot now be required to survey the lines of the original grant. I enclose for your information an extract of my instructions to Col Butler under the act of 1828 *
by which you will perceive that those claims were required to be laid down on his plat agreeably to the provisions of the act of 1827 and after being so laid down on the plats to be returned to the Land Office the parties will have to make their entries with the Reg' of the land office within the boundaries thus represented.

<docbody>SIR You will perceive by the Memorial that I handed to you yesterday, in regard to the establishment of a mail rout from the Seat of Gov' to Key West," the petitioners are anxious to make Charleston (SC) the distributing office, which would certainly be very desirable, inasmuch as the mail could be carried to Key West by that rout several days sooner than via Tallahassee, but as the expenses in carrying it the latter rout would be considerably lessened.
I do not suppose they would have any particular objection to its being sent that way—I am not prepared to say what the mail could be carried from either Charleston or Tallahassee for twice a month, but I should suppose that it could be done from Charleston for about
$4000, and about $2000 or 2500 from Tallahassee *—
There is another subject to which I beg leave to call your attention—
It is the dividing line between the Collection districts of St Augustine
& Key West, The two Ports are nearly 500 miles apart, and the jurisdiction of the Collector at Key West only extends to Cape Sable and the Islands nearest thereto, which is not more than 40 miles from Key West as you will see by a referrence to the law which was

approved in May 1822, The dividing ought to be at Indian River which empties itself into the Gulf Stream about 100 miles north of Cape Florida, which is about equi distant from each of the Ports *—
In regard to extending the right of Debenture to goods shipped Coastwise to Key West," when that subject is before the Committees, I wish you would introduce a resolution, calling for the amount of duties that has been paid at the different ports of Florida since it was ceded to the U States and the am" paid at each port—I am very respectfully Your ob" S'

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26" Ult” post marked 28" and received by last mail. The reasons for not furnishing you with the information required by your letter of the 9" Sept" * without any delay, you will find given in my last of the 15" inst "—I regret extremely that there should even be supposed, an infraction of the Act of 31* January 1823," on my part, and I feel at a loss to know in what manner it applies to me, as I have regularly transmitted my accounts; and the Surveys upon which they are based, have been also returned as soon as it was practicable under the orders from your department to continue the Surveys of the private claims from year to year.—I was led to believe

from your letter that the Surveys in question would be suspended and my accounts proceed in their regular train of Settlement; and being anxious to place full and accurate information before you, I
have been waiting the arrival of two deputy Surveyors who are interested in these Surveys when my report would have been made for your decision.
By reference to the Surveys on the Escambia, it will be found that the parallels of the Townships on the East are South of those on the West, and the Range inself Somewhat narrowed on the North, which Arises from the following causes: Wiz, In running the parallel in 1824–5, the waters were extremely high and the Season inclement—
the distance across Black water and Escambia Bays about 6% miles, Ret:Hääg di-wieliag thena on the parallel & nothing but marsh in which the Surveyor and hands were frequently obliged to help each other out of the Mud: the observations taken across these bays by means of Flags, in all probability were imperfect and a variation north from the true line might have been the consequence.
When the Surveys were ordered to be executed in that quarter the Swamps of the Escambia were impracticable owing to high waters; in consequence of which I directed a Meredian to be run from the first Township Corner, west of Said river, and the Surveys to proceed west. When the Range in Question Come to be run out Subsequently the facts above Stated developed themselves, Yet I
am persuaded that the Surveys on the river are correctly made, That this Range, should have narrowed on the north will readily occur to you as a matter not to be Controuled from the circumstance of Several Surveyors being engaged in running the Ranges from Tallahassee to the point on the east, and a new Meredian extended on the west of said river it would have been a miracle to have fitted them exactly. With these explanations and a reference to the returns forwarded you, I am in hopes they will prove satisfactory."
I have the honor to be Very respectfully Yr Ob S'

<docbody>SIR, In an interview I had the honor to have with the President I
informed him of various reports unfavorable to the character of John Dean lately appointed Marshal of the Southern District of Florida *—
The President assured me, in a manner which whilst it evinced his elevation of character was highly satisfactory to me, & will be, to those I represent that if improper persons had been recommended &
appointed, & he could be satisfied of the fact, that he would himself correct the evil by substituting honest & competent men—He requested me to submit the nature of the complaints against M. Dean which are as follow.
I was informed by M. James M*Mullin of the firm of Wellford &
McMullin late of Baltimore, & now of Tallahassee that John Dean was a clerk in their store, & that after he left their employment various errors were discovered, in their books which impressed him most unfavorably towards the honesty of the said Dean, & he does not hesitate to express his belief that he is not an honest man-
I also saw a letter from a most respectable merchant of Baltimore to Mr MeIMullin saying that Dean was in that City Shortly after his appointment endeavoring to borrow money to get to Key West, saying that he had expended all his in Washington in procuring his security—This Gentleman added that such appointments would be

extremely injurious to the administration—M*Mullin is a man of as much honor, and Character, as any to be found in our whole Community—I understand that all the respectable people in Alabama near where M Dean lived express very unfavorable opinions of his competency, moral conduct, & deportment generally—of this M."
Lewis "the member from Alabama perhaps can speak—I have heard Byrd C. Willis a gentleman well known to the President speak in unfavorable terms of Dean & of his standing & Character.
There is one objection however, that I think the President will consider insuperable—It must be known to him that property, &
money to the amount of several hundred thousand dollars pass through the hands of the Marshal annually—I understand that Dean has given but one Security, & he a man who was in the prison bounds here for debt for many months, & who had conveyed his real estate to trustees for the benefit of his wife some time before—It must be perceived that this immence amount of property is, or will be in the hands of an individual of at least doubtful, & suspicious character without security—
The fact of such a man's offering such security is conclusive against him—

SIR I now enclose you my accounts of expenditure for the improvement of the Inland navigation between the S" Marys & S*

I was encouraged with the hope, as expressed in my report of October last; * that the Contractor would enable me to close my agency under your department by this time—M Kingsley however was called north in November, and his agent not understanding some precautionary instructions I had transmitted herein, deemed it most prudent to suspend the work at Amelia narrows untill his employers return—

received a letter from M Kingsley stating that he would resume work late this, or early the next month, and would be prepared for my final inspection of the improvement of the Inland navigation in February next-
The delay has been advantageous as affording time for the banks to settle, and an opportunity to the Contractor of judging of the effects of the current and of applying the proper remedy I have just received over the signature of the Secretary of War (but not untill after I had sat down to make out my accounts for the closing quarter of this year) Copies of two sections of the acts of Congress of January 1823 relating to disbursing officers,” and regret that you should have deemed so delicate a hint of my supposed public obligations at all necessary—The penalties in the 3"Section, you must be aware can have no terrors for me, other than the accompanying implication of what I never was & never will be a public defaulter, and in postponing the closing of my accounts, for the reasons stated above, I feel a conviction that the public interests have not been prejudiced thereby, for I have no acknowledgement of the reception or adjudication of my accounts for the two first quarters of the year long since transmitted through your office”

“District of East Florida County of Alachua Superior Court for December 1829.
“Grand Jury Room, the 26" day of December 1829.
“The Grand Jury for the County of Alachua, considering it both a right and a duty to express their opinions on matters interesting to the public, and especially to their own County and District; beleiving also, that the exercise of this right, and the discharge of this duty, in a cautious and deliberate manner, is often advantageous to the community in obviating evils, and promoting benefits, take the liberty to represent—That they are of opinion, from a knowledge of the localities and character of the Country, contiguous to the public, commonly called Bellamy's road, that the repair and renewal of that road East from this Court House to Picolati on the St. John’s River, will be attended with no advantage or convenience to the public. They are of this opinion, because the district through which this road passes, more than sixty miles in extent, is without a settlement upon it, and will probably long remain in this state;—because it terminates at a point on the River, where there are no inhabitants—where the river itself, is exposed to bleak winds, is of great width, and generally impassable, and where, as no ferry has been recently kept, none can be expected with any certainty in future;—and because, if this road should be again opened, it would again grow up, for want of use, as it has already, since it was cut and cleared by Bellamy, in 1826.”
“The Grand Jury, therefore, beg leave to recommend, instead of a waste on this road, of the public money appropriated by the munificence of the General Government, that it be employed and expended in the highly useful and beneficial purpose of Clearing, straightening and improving the public road from this Court house to Jacksonville on the S" Johns—A route of the first necessity, and which does, and will continue to command and accomodate more travel, than any other in East Florida.”
“The Grand Jury respectfully request, that a Copy of their presentment, as to this road, be transmitted, by order of this Court, to the

Quarter Master General of the United States Army, for his information touching the matter to which it relates.”

<docbody>SIR, When I proposed to address a communication to you on a subject as I conceived demanded by a sense of public duty to my constituents I did not suppose an opportunity would have been afforded me of a personal interview with the President—After I had commenced, & before I had completed the letter of which the enclosed was the commencement, I was invited to visit the President with a view to a conversation on the public affairs of Florida.
I availed myself of that occasion to say what I intended to have added to the letter which I Should have asked the favor of you to lay before him—I found that he had already received letters from the Territory on the subjects most interesting to the people there, & on the points that I desired Should be presented to him.
I have been led to believe that my interferance was considered rather intrusive and unauthorized by perhaps some of the functionaries of the govement-As the motives & grounds of my petition or remonstrance, are disclosed in this unfinished communication, I have thought proper to submit it to your candid consideration—I hope while it evinces a disposition on my part to maintain the rights which belong to my official Station, it will not be found to claim an improper assumption of authority, or to set up unauthorized & preposterous pretentions-
I beg leave to assure you that no personal, or official disrespect has ever been intended by me to any of the high officers of the Govement, & that the only motive I have at this time in submitting this paper, _-

is to redeem myself from any imputation of an obstrusive or impertinent interferrence in matters in which I have no concern—

HON M WAN BUREN Sec of State
[Endorsed] Florida Appointments White, J. M. Jan 4. 30. The Delegate of of Florida
[Enclosure]
Delegate White to the Secretary of State WASHINGTON Dec 28th 1829.
SIR, In our recent personal interview, you did me the honor to request a written communication, relative to the appointments in Florida, assuring me at the same time, that whatever I might have to suggest on that subject would be favorably received by yourself and submitted with your best reflections, to the pleasure of the President, who might also be expected to bestow on it his respectful consideration.
Relying on this assurance, and regarding it as an invitation to lay before the Executive the wishes and feelings of my constituents, I
should not manifest a proper sensibility to my rights and duties as their Delegate, if I forebore to express their sentiments with that frankness which belongs to the occasion, and is equally due to them, to you, to the President, and to myself—The population of Florida consists almost entirely of emigrants from Virginia, North and South Carolina and Georgia, principally from the two latter States. It must be known to you that they cherish in common with their countrymen certain views of policy, and principles of legislation which have been familiar to them from their youth and are inseperable from their existence.
It cannot have escaped your attention that the people of the South receive few offices from the General Government and derive little advantage from its patronage or expenditure—I submit how far on principles of sound policy it is proper to increase an inequality already existing, and to agravate the evils of our condition by sending among us those who are strangers to our habits, aliens to our institutions, feelings, and if you please prejudices, incapable of entering into our interests, and not always able to suppress opinions dangerous to our peace, and distructive to our rights to property.”
I firmly believe that three fourths of the whole population of Florida are much and justly dissatisfied with the appointments made there-

In saying this I mean only to speak their language, and that of truth without disguise and without offence, untinged even in the form of expression by any feelings of local or general faction, private interest, or personal resentment—
It is more than conjectured that the provincial party opposed to me are at least as much discontented as my friends—They have not concealed their chagrene from officers of the Government, and I am informed that their complaints have even reached the ears of the President himself—such a coincidence of opinion between those who concur so seldom, is no slight proof of the depth and universality of the feeling I have attributed to my constituents. While expressing as I am bound to do their disappointment and mortification, I feel it my duty also to state, that I have never desired to exert, or attempted to acquire a personal influence in appointments for the Territory—I have always had at heart the selection of able and honorable men, and next to this I have insisted that the wishes and interests of the people of Florida should be respected—Heretofore, fortunately I have succeeded in procureing the general recognition of this principle, and when, which has been seldom, circumstances were suffered to require a departure from it, such forbearance, circumspection, and delicacy have been exhibited as became the public functionaries of a generous and powerful Government, toward the humble agent of a helpless, distant and dependent province.
Whether there is any peculiar exigency at the present moment calling for a change in the favorable dispositions heretofore displayed to the people of Florida, or how far under given circumstances any administration may feel bound to overlook the preferences of those in whose country, and for whose benefit and Government, offices have been created, are questions which I have not the slightest disposition to agitate.
Whenever it shall be determined that it is expedient to make Territorial appointments without respect to the wishes of the Territory, or the formality or a reference to its only authorized agent here, such agent cannot be expected to intrude information, or volunteer opinions, and the Government assuming the responsibility from which he is exempted, relieve him from a burthensome and invidious portion of his duty-
That the mind of the President has been prepared to receive with distrust any recommendation of mine on the subject of offices in Florida, or at least that efforts have been made to effect that object there can be no question. In the first conversation I had the honor to hold with him, he intimated that there was so much divission among 115* and so many complaints of each other, that the Government would form unfavorable opinions of all, and be compelled to

select its officers from abroad—I am not aware that my friends or myself are justly liable to be comprehended in this remark, and I
claim an exemption from its force for them and for myself—I declare and appeal not only to the files of the Departments, but to the recollection of those who filled them, to sustain the declaration that we have never under this, or the preceeding Administration wearried the high officers of the Government with our local bickerings, or loaded their Bureaus with our complaints and recriminations. If the murmers of the minority have been so numerous as to draw down upon the whole the censure due only to a part, I most sincerely deplore an incident which by creating disgust here, may injure those who are not at all responsible for it.—
If I can be permitted to have access to the complaints which I have most respectfully solicited, and the President and yourself amid your other more important duties, can find time to indulge me with a full and frank discussion of the subject, I pledge myself to remove every unfavorable impression against my own course, and that of those who elected me.—
I think I understood from the President in the same conversation that there were no removals except for oppression or defalcation—
The conversation was interrupted by company and I might have mistaken his meaning. If charges of this discription have been made against the twelve officers removed in Florida, the oppression or defalcation was unknown to the people of the Territory—
It is due to the Executive that no motive of delicacy should prevent the disclosure of charges which produce a removal, since odium may thus unjustly be diverted from the faithless servants to the vigilant and unspareing guardians of the commonwealth—
In relation to the merits or demerits of the removed, however, it is unnecessary to speak, since I learned from our interview that to reinstate them was impossible. If then there can be no restorations on account of the condition of our Territory, and is deemed proper to exclude its inhabitants from office, I submit for the reasons before stated the propriety of making a selection among Citizens of those States whence our population is derived.
The characters, talents, and qualifications of the prominent men there, are known to our people and will bespeak for them the public confidence and respect, and a similarity of interests and opinions between the public agents and the population cannot fail gradually to restore harmony to our society, and to improve and consolidate all our institutions.”

<docbody>GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter from Lt & Aid de Camp Cooper dated on the 30 Nov 1829,” which letter relates to a subject of very deep interest to the citizens of Middle and Eastern Florida, and also places the officer Commanding in the Peninsula of Florida in rather an awkward predicament, as it exacts certain duties of him without placing the adequate means in his hands, or without giving him sufficient latitude, to effect the object in view. A pretty correct knowledge of the Topography of Florida, the character, views, and interest of its inhabitants, as well as the character, disposition, and wants of the Creek & Seminole Indians, enables me to form a tolerable correct estimate as to the least expensive, and most certain mode of giving safety to, and

quieting the fears and apprehensions of the Citizens of this new and interesting section of the Union.
Altho' I am Hatteh strongly in favor of keeping the Companies of a Regiment as much together as possible, I am of opinion that in the present case, it would be much more to the interests of the service, and more likely to effect the object in view, to have a company stationed near the Indian boundary, than to have one occationally sent from this post-In coming to this conclusion, I have been governed by the following reasons. A company permanently stationed near the boundary line, would keep the Indians in awe, and prevent them in a great measure from making their predatory excursions into the settlements, and if any depredations were committed on the Citizens, and complaints made, the commanding officer, if vigilent and efficient, could intercept them before they could return to the Nation—-
This post is distant from one hundred and twenty, to one hundred and fifty miles from the settlements usually visited by the Indians,—
the latter could if so disposed, commit the greatest outrages on the persons and property of the Citizens, and return to their hiding places, before the commanding officer could be apprised of the facts. The country between this post, and the settlements is generally low, and during the summer and fall months, the water is scarce, and of very bad quality, & should it be found necessary to detach a company during those months, it is believed that the health, if not the lives of the men would be endangered by it.
On the score of economy a decided preference, will be found in favor of the location of the Company—This opinion is strengthened by the enclosed statement, made by Assistant Commissary Lieut Newcomb,”
which I beg leave to submit to your consideration—
Lieut Newcomb was stationed some time at Fort King, and is a young officer of high promise—The quarters at Fort King could be reoccupied at very little expense, or if a more eligible and convenient site, can be found, at or near a place on the Ocklawaha river, known as Paynes landing (and from every thing that I can learn, I am induced to believe such a site can be found) temporary log huts, could be erected in fifteen or twenty days at a very small expense to the government. This proposed site is fifty miles by water from the S*
Johns River, and about twenty five by land–It is fifty below Fort King by water, and about fifteen by land, and I feel confident that an active and efficient officer, with twenty five or thirty men, could

clear it out, and make it navigable from the S. Johns to Paynes landing, for the largest class of boats, or small schooners, in fifteen or twenty days. This object being accomplished, the Troops at that Post taking every thing into consideration, could be supplied on as good terms, as they could at S*Augustine.
Lieut Graham ” who has command of the company engaged in repairing the military road, between this and the agency, and who is a most active and efficient officer, informs me that he expects to complete it, by the last of February, after which should the company return to this Post, they will have to erect quarters, as their are only quarters for four companies,—I therefore have the honor to recommend, that after the object for which the Company was detailed is effected, that he be directed to take post either at Fort King, or Paynes landing, and remain until next winter, and there to be releived, or ordered down as circumstances may render necessary—send out small detachments, with directions to go through the settlements on the Frontier, as often as necessary, to examine and open the Ocklawaha River from Paynes landing to its mouth so as to enable the command to get all of their supplies through that channel—Should you feel disposed to confide these arrangements to my judgement, and discretion, I will be strictly responsible for the quiet of the Frontier, and the economy of the expenditures made by the Detachment. I
beg respectfully to submit to your consideration a copy of a communication to Major General Brown, & which grew out of an order from Major General Brown, confiding the protection of the Frontiers of Georgia and Florida to my care"—

26" May 1824. From the decisions of this Gettet ef Appeals Appellate Court, writs of error & appeals may be taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, if the amount in controversy exceed one Thousand dollars.” The Committee cannot perceive any adequate reason for changing this provision; law; in relation te & allowing a direct appeal in Admiralty & Maritime cases, from the Court for the Southern Judicial District of Florida, to the Supreme Court of the United States. Stieh an alteratień whilst it wettlé inerease the business ef the Süpreme Gettet, whieh theer the existing laws weuld still fürther destroy the eehfermity ef eth Jüdieial System It is true that many causes of Admiralty & Maritime jurisdiction—
& some of them of large amounts are decided by the Court of the Southern District of Florida: & it Haight be eehvehieht te but if this were sufficient reason for allowing an immediate appeal from that Court, to the Supreme Court, it would apply with equal force to cases ef this of a similar nature decided by several ef the District Courts of the United States; This wettlé greatly inerease the business from whose decrees in such causes, an appeal is now allowed in the first instance to the Circuit Courts. The If the law were thus changed the consequences would be a great increase of the business of the Supreme Court, which, already so onerous that it can scarcely be transacted without interferring with the terms of the Circuit Courts.
Your Committee therefore effer & recommend the following resolution Resolved that it is inexpedient to provide by law that all appeals &

<place-time>[Referred January 11, 1830]</place-time>
<docbody>To, ANDREW JACKSON, President of the United States The memorial of the undersigned most respectfully sheweth, that they, with many other respectable citizens of the United States have, with unfeigned regret and disquitude, to deplore the continuance among them of Joseph L. Smith, the Judge of the Superior Court for the District of East Florida; as, from his numerous violations of the law and of justice, he has rendered himself unfit to discharge with propriety and impartiality the solemn duties of his highly responsible office. Your Memorialists deprecate the necessity of having recource to self-defence to protect themselves from his violence and oppression;
and unless the Cheif Magistrate of the United States, to whom they all look up with confidance and reverence, will not redress their numerous greivances, they must resort to the “ultima ratio regum' to protect themselves.
Representations were forwarded to the last Administration reprobating the conduct of that individual, both in his private and public capacity; but strange to say, they were never noticed at least, not acted upon, consequently affording him fresh opportunities of wreaking his private malice upon all those whom he chose to consider his

enemies; But many of his former friends are so disgusted with recent acts of his violence, injustice and partiality as to declare openly, that they will no longer support a man guilty of such reprehensible behaviour; a man whom all desire to look to as an example of all that is noble, just, and honorable, and not as one using his Judicial power to accomplish his political projects, but which they have to despise as the vehicle of private slander and the head which directs it, as a Bully among the people. All your Memorialists most respectfully solicit an investigation into his character, and request it at your hands as the President of the United States bound to protect all good Citizens of our happy Country, and above all to sustain unsullied the purity of the Judiciary, as no greater evil can exist in any community, than a Corrupt Judge.—Your Memorialists, therefore, without further preface, beg leave to lay before you the specifications of their charges, and will state nothing but what can be proved by indisputable evidence. For further information on this subject, we respectfully refer you to Governor Duval General Call, Colonel Gadsden, and Major Chairs and Doctor Gibson, residents of this Territory. Your Memorialists also humbly request your attention to the Affidavits, already filed in Washington, of Levoritt H. Coe, James P. Cotter and Samuel Northrup, and to those now inclosed.
It has been stated that the President cannot remove a Judge in a Territory without an impeachment, and with the approval of the Senate. If it be so, it is indeed a greivous burden on the People.
When we consider the trouble and difficulty attending a prosecution of an impeachment, and the accumulating complaints of the people, it is to be hoped that their interests and liberties will be paramount to any that may be felt for an Individual, and entitle the foregoing statement & inclosed Affidavits to evry consideration which their importance requires”-

SIR, I enclose herewith, a letter from the clerk of the District Court of Florida, covering an extract from the Presentiments of the Grand Jury of Alachua County,” expressive of the opinion, of the inexpediency of bestowing any repairs upon that portion of the road from Tallahassee to St. Augustine, which lies between Alachua Court House, and Picolata, on the St. Johns River.
The officer charged with the superintendence of this work has been engaged upon it now about a month, & there is reason to apprehend, that the greater part of the money at disposal, for this object, will have been expended before further instructions could reach him. As the appropriation was made at your instance, I should be glad to receive your views on the subject.
You are aware, that the appropriation being specifically for the repair of the Road from Tallahassee to St Augustine, could not be applied to any other, as suggested by the enclosed papers, without a law authorizing it—The work could be suspended until such authority be obtained, or the whole of the present appropriation might be applied to the Tallahassee Road lying west of Alachua Court House, and an appropriation obtained at the present session, for the repair of the other road from that that place to Jacksonville. The latter would, perhaps, be the better course, as it would leave more funds applicable to the western portion of the Tallahassee road, & thus ensure a more thorough repair than could possibly be effected by the same means throughout its whole course.

SIR: The inexpediencey of bestowing any repairs upon that portion of the road from Tallahassee to St: Augustine, which lies between Alachua Court House and Picolati, on the St. Johns River, has been strongly represented, and the delegate from the Territory concurs in the representation. You will therefore, if you receive these instruetions in time, apply the whole sum appropriated, on that portion of the road lying between Alachua Court House and Tallahassee.
It was suggested, in connexion with the above mentioned representation, to repair the road leading from Alachua Court House to Jacksonville, instead of that to Picolati; but the appropriation being specific, could not be diverted, and it was deemed the better course, to expend it all upon the road West of Alachua Court House, and endeavor to obtain one at the present Session of Congress for the repair of the road to Jacksonville-

<source>[NA:SF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:LS]</source>
<place-time>WASHINGTON Jan 26* 1830</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have been informed that the President of the United States, has transmitted to the Senate two appointments for the Territory of Florida, which, in behalf of my Constituents, I humbly pray may not be confirmed-In adopting this course permit me to assure you, that I am not concious of any other motive than an honest zeal for the public good, and a disposition faithfully to discharge my obliga-

tions to the people who have confided their interests to my care. I am animated neither by personal resentment, nor political opposition.
I have no friends to recommend for the Offices in question and am indifferent who fills them, if the incumbents are men of good character, correct habits, and sufficient qualifications.”
The people of Florida necessarily denied any agency in the confirmation or rejection, of these appointments, have yet as deep an interest in them, as those of any part of the union—However incapable, or unprepared for self government, the theory of our laws, and Constitution, may suppose them, yet, they have a right to be well governed, and the helplesness of their dependent condition, only authorizes them to look with more confidence, and to speak with more freedom to the generous protective powers of the Senate—
The inclosed draught of a letter prepared for the Secretary of State,” will explain the views which I had the honor to suggest for his consideration—I regret that they brought no conviction to his judgment, since the pain of making this appeal had otherwise been spared me. As it is, I have no choice. It is my duty as the Representative, and in the name of the people of Florida to remonstrate against a confirmation of the appointments of James D. Westcott,"
Secretary, and John G. Stower * District Attorney of the Southern Judicial District—
In the performance of this unpleasant task I shall not stop to enquire how, or by whom, these Gentlemen were recommended."
The Senate are conversant with the value of recommendations; it is known with how little regard to merit they are frequently given, sometimes because refusal is ungracious, often to avoid importunity—
There is a just difference in the object for which they are intended, as there is in commerce, between the home Market, and exportation—
It is sometimes harder to obtain recommendations for the humblest office in New York, or New Jersey, than the first in Florida or Arkansas. The Territories are too apt to be considered as the patrimony of the decayed, or neglected politicians of the States, and the condition of Society imputed to them as a reproach, is in part to be attributed to impolitic appointments—The rule however is not without excep-

tions. It has not yet been proposed to fill the Government of Michigan, with cast off agitators from Georgia, or the Carolinas—
In Florida there are at present six Gentlemen holding important Offices, all of whom are from the non-Slave holding States—It is not the purpose of my Constituents to draw invidious distinctions, but they most respectfully beg leave to question the propriety of subjecting a southern population to be governed by persons whose views and principles are so much at varience with their own. To them it seems that the danger of disturbing questions now happily at rest, is increased by appointing to office in Southern Territories, those who seldom have discretion enough to conceal opinions odious to the population. Nor can they perceive the propriety of rewarding even meritorious servants, by so distant a removal from the sphere of their past utility—No practical injustice they conceive will be done to any aspirants for Office by confining their ambition to the places most in unison with their habits, and education. Each quarter of the country it is believed affords situations numerous enough to gratify all who come recommended by signal merit, or distinguished talent. But my Constituents do not rest their opposition to M* Westcott on this ground only. He came among them thena entirely unknown. They had not heard of the services by which he obtained his distinction.
His reputation had not preceded him. They knew him but by what they saw, and on that they formed a judgment decidedly unfavorable.
They have learned that he is a native of New Jersey, and was lately a clerk in the State Department. Some political or other controversy, which placed him as he imagined under the neccssity of sending a challenge, induced him to tender his resignation, inasmuch as he had heretofore condemned such a violation of the law by an Officer of the Government. His resignation was accepted, and his place filled. The quarrel was adjusted, and the people of Florida, ignorant of the evidence he had given of his fitness for the Office, saw him with some surprise translated to the Territory as Secretary, in virtue of which commission he is now Acting as Governor. They believe him without the talent, experience, or discretion, requisite for such a trust, and their intercourse with him, far from changing, has only confirmed that opinion. For myself I can say that since my departure from the Territory, the appointment has never been mentioned to me without being condemned, and this without distinction as to local or general parties. I believe that nine tenths of the people are dissatisfied, and having learned from the highest authority that offices are created for their benefit, not for individuals holding them, they cannot persuade themselves that their wishes when known will be disregarded.
When the duty of scrutinizing the pretensions of persons nominated

imposes on the confirming power the necessity of examining into mens characters and habits the task of adducing evidence becomes a delicate and invidious one. It is natural, therefore, that I should prefer placing the objections of my Constituents whenever it is possible on a well supported ground of expediency, in accordance with the spirit of our institutions, and if I am not greatly mistaken, repeatedly recognized by the Senate itself. In all governments the happiness of the people is, or ought to be the first object of the rulers. It never can be their true interest to consult the qualification of any individual at the expense of the wishes of a community—The letter of Governor Duval " which I have the honor to enclose will satisfy the Senate that there is great dissatisfaction existing in Florida on this subject.
He concurs in the Statement and opinions expressed in my letter to the Secretary of State. Florida has been principally settled by a population, respectable, well educated, and intelligent—They know that the surest guarantee they can have for the fidelity and zeal of the public officers is their community of interest and feeling with the people, and the conciousness that the laws which they administer, and the policy which they adopt are to bear equally upon themselves as parts of the system—There are honest and capable men enough in the Territory to fill all its offices to the satisfaction of those whose rights and interests are involved in their correct administration. If any adequate motive of public policy excludes them from all participation in the official honors and emoluments of the province, which they have made their home, and in whose prosperity they have the deepest stake, surely it cannot be necessary to increase their mortification by placing over them in authority, those whom they believe to be incapable of useing it either with the kindness of Masters, or the modesty of Stewarts.
It is incumbent on me also most respectfully to state my objections to the confirmation of the appointment of John G. Stowers—He is not only the Attorney for the United States charged with the interests of Government in the numerous and important questions which arise under the laws of Nations, and the Revenue, and other acts of the United States, but he is the prosecutor for all offences against the laws of the Territory. M. Stowers was appointed last April.” He did not arrive at key West until December," after the adjournment of the fall court, and immediately returned to the North. His services are in constant requisition, yet he has not spent a week at his post for nine months—Highly respectable professional Gentlemen assure me that he had not the necessary legal acquirements for such an Office.

He is moreover represented to be a man of idle and loose habits devoted to gameing and upon one occasion in this City suffered personal chastisement from one of his own colleagues for an alleged attempt to cheat at cards. I am aware of the responsibility of such a charge and am assured by Gentlemen of unquestionable veracity that if compulsory process be allowed to bring in witnesses the facts can be proved. When I called at the Department of State to obtain information relative to the removals and appointments in Florida, I understood one of the reasons assigned for the selection of M. Stowers was his being the only applicant. This of course would be sufficient had the office been then vacant, but as it was at that time filled by a Gentleman of competant talents and legal learning, whose commission was not about to expire, applications could hardly have been anticipated. The absence of competition does not argue the impossibility of making a better choice. -
These remarks extorted from me by a strong sense of public duty, are submitted with the most sincere difference to the wisdom and justice of the Senate."—
I am with great respect Your Mo. Ob. St—

SIR, In consequence of extreme indisposition since my arrival in the city (a few days since) I could not pay my respects in propria persona, of which I am very anxious as I have heard with infinite surprize and astonishment that my character has been assailed with the view of preventing my nomination before the Senate: *—that there would be an effort made when ever a probable chance of success should offer)
to prevent the confirmation of all the appointments made by the present Executive in Florida,—I had expected from the tone of a few individuals of that Ter” who I understand assumes dictatorial powers;—but that my private character (which I understand is the case) should be assailed at this distant period, -and as I must suppose by persons who are entirely unacquainted with me, -and who probably never saw me, -has astonish'd me indeed. You Sir, will no doubt apreciate my surprize properly when I inform you that I have pass'd through the ordeal of some kind of public employment since I was 21 years of age up to the present moment without having my pub. or private character assailed, ühless save only those whose abuse I esteem preferable to their commendations.
I hope Sir, under existing circumstances, that you will not consider me obtrusive, or requiring too much in requesting you to confer (if necessary) with the President, to the end that any nomination that might be contemplated, should be suspended for a few days 'til I can venture out, prepared I hope—to refute and repel any and every charge derogatory to my character. Before closing this communica-

<place-time>Head Quarters of the Army WASHINGTON Jany 28th 1830.</place-time>
<docbody>To THE HON. JOHN H. EATON, Secretary of War.
SIR; The subject of the letter of Mr White of Florida addressed to you on the 25th inst." and refered by you to the General Head Quarters of the Army, I have attentively considered. Mr White states that he has received a presentment of the Grand Jury of Alachua County east Florida," and various letters, urging the necessity of the establishment of one or two companies of troops at Cantonement King in East Florida; or at some point, between the Indian line and the White settlements, to preserve the latter from the constant depredation of the Indians on their settlement and property.
There was formerly one company stationed at Fort King: It was represented to the Government, to be a useless expense to keep the troops, in that quarter, and the seperation of the Army, into garrisons, so small as one company, was also found to be attended not only with great expense; but with injury to the discipline of the Army.
Under these views and considerations the Troops after duly consulting with intelligent officers and individuals on the subject, were

ordered to join the garrison at Tampa Bay," which is the present Head Quarters of the 4the Infty, and the Cantonement King of course abandoned.
The Commanding Officer at Tampa Bay was however instructed to watch over the interests of the people in Alachua, and to protect them against any depredations which the Indians might be disposed to commit.” He was authorized to march detachments of Troops into that Country should there any apprehension on the part of the inhabitants, with regard to the disposition of the Indians, and to take such measures as would ensure the tranquility of the settlers.
If the commanding Officer Colonel Clinch uses that vigilance which I have every reason to beleive he will, I cannot see that any danger, can be apprehended from the miserable Indians, who inhabit the peninsula of Florida.”
I have the honor to be Yr. Most. Obt. Servt.

<place-time>[January, 1830]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate & Howse of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled The undersigned your petitioners humbly beg leave to represent the great inconvenience they now labor under from the want of a port of entry somewhere on the River St Johns—
Numerous masters vessels now engaged in the West India trade direct to this River are subjected to the expence and inconvenience of a journey from this to S' Augustine for the purpose of entering and clearing their vessels a distance of forty Miles—
In a Country like this where the mode of conveyance is precarious and expensive, it is easy to conceive the difficulty merchants residing here are liable to in chartering vessels for their trade owing to the over charged freights Masters of vessels will always exact under this state of affairs. Taking into account the growing importance of this Section of Florida & the extent & size of the River St Johns, the no inconsiderable quantity of good lands directly upon its banks, & the much larger that must shortly present their products to its bosom as the only channel through which they can pass—Your petitioners are not aware of any objections that can be raised against this measure equal to the advantages to be derived from its adoption. If it were for no other object than to protect the revenue from the pernicious effects of an extensive smuggling trade the benefits of which go to a few, and the evils to all, your petitioners think the measure feasible
& almost imperative on the authorities of the Nation. This subject has for a long time been before Congress and its importance urged the Legislative Council of 1824 recommended this measure, & the succeeding Council of 1825 reiterated its importance by an article on the subject in their general memorial to Congress, an extract of which follows
“We also strongly recommend the establishment of a Custom House at Jacksonville on the River S‘Johns; for these reasons, that it will be a great relief to Ship Masters coming from a foreign port, who are now compelled to travel from 40 to 50 Miles to enter their vessels, &
because it is a place of considerable enterprize-
Another reason why this point is recommended in preference to any other is partly the healthy situation of the place, & its commodious distance from the mouth of the River, & partly because it is the centre of navigation in East Florida-”
These arguments which had their weight at the time they were

made, & which were unanimously supported by the Legislative Council, continue to support the measure with superadded importance—All the navigation of importance passes to its destination either to this place or at some point above or else within 5 miles below—
Jacksonville is situated on the Kings Road from Georgia to S*
Augustine, and is the point thro' which the Northern Mail together with the Tallahassee Mail passes South into the Territory.—This is also the place where the United States have two Courts a year, &
where more than half the business of the Court of East Florida is transacted These and other considerations have induced your petitioners to renew their application. And they most earnestly hope their prayer may be heard—

The instructions to Gov Duval to Select the lands appropriated for colleges in Florida, were given from the Treasury.” His letter designating the Lands selected" was referred to this Office and answered, See page N° 1.
I presume the instructions were entirely silent as to the allowance of any compensation for making the Selections, the law being Silent on that Subject In authorizing the Governors of the States & Territories to make these Selections. the Sec of the Treasury no doubt has been governed by the consideration that the difference in the value of the Lands Selected at the discretion of the Gov" and of that which would be selected by himself or any other U States Officer merely from an inspection of the Surveyors returns would more than compensate for any expense which the States & Territories would incur in procuring the Selections to be made by actual inspection of the Lands. I know of no instance in which the expenses incident to the expeases Selections made by the Gov' of States & Territories have been allowed at the Treasury, or of any law under which such an allowance could be made. A distinction might for these instances be made in respect to and in favor of Territories, but if so a Special appropriation should be obtained. The papers are herewith returned I am &c. G G.

<place-time>[February 5, 1830]</place-time>
<docbody>No. 162. Pre-emption to certain Persons in Florida Made February
5th 1830.
Mr. Isacks, from the Committee on the Public Lands, to which the subject had been referred, made the following Report:
The Committee on the Public Lands being instructed to inquire into the expediency of granting the right of pre-emption to those persons in Florida, whose improvements were sold in 1825, and those included in the lands ceded to the Indians, and who have been entitled to a pre-emption if the sale and cession had not been made before the passage of the pre-emption law of 1826, report:
That by the act of 22d April, 1826,” the right of pre-emption to a quarter section of land was given to heads of families, or persons over the age of 21 years, who, on or before the 1st day of January, 1825, had actually inhabited and cultivated a tract of land in Florida, and had not removed therefrom; of which settlement, proof was required to be made to the Register and Receiver of the Land Offices.
But in May, 1825, and before the passage of the pre-emption law, a part of the Public Lands was sold by the United States; and it appears by a certificate of the Register and Receiver at Talahassee, that eight persons had made settlements on the lands, which were sold, who, under said pre-emption law, had the sale not been made, would have been entitled to a pre-emption in the land they occupied.
These persons, in the opinion of the Committee, were equally entitled to the favor of the Government, on account of these early settlements, with those who did not happen to live on the lands which had been sold before the privilege of pre-emption was recognized, and as the best amends which can now be made for the loss of their improvements, and the lands they had selected, they ought to be allowed to privilege of entering an equal quantity of land, at the Government price elsewhere.
The testimony on the other branch of the resolution shows that two persons, namely, Ellis Wood and Mary Dawes, were actually settlers, and would have been entitled to a pre-emption, but that the land on which they lived had been reserved to an Indian Chief, by the Treaty of the 18th of September, 1823.” That, by the act of

2d February, 1827, section 15,” the right of pre-emption, elsewhere, is given to three persons who had made settlements on lands reserved to Indian Chiefs by the same treaty; and the Committee see no reason why those two persons should not have the same relief, and report a bill for that purpose.”

[Endorsed] H Reps. 10 Feb 1830 Hon Jos: M. White Rel. to suits in Florida, under PreFmption Law—with enclosures.—G. G.
[Enclosures]
Opinions of the Territorial Supreme Court re Application of Preemption Act
[No Date]
The United States by the Relation of Lewis Gregory vs The Register & Reciever of the Western land District This case comes before the Court by writ of error to the Judge of superior Court of the middle District, & the error alledged, is, the having issued a Mandamus to the Register & Reciever of the western land District, commanding them to admit to entry, two seperate half quarters of a section, in the same section, within their District, The said Gregory having proved himself entitled to the preemption of a quarter of a section, under the act of Congress of the 26" of April
1826.86
The first question for the Court to consider is, whether the Relator has a perfect legal right, & for which he has no other specific remedy.
His right to purchase, or his preemption is not disputed, on the contrary it is admited. The only question, is, as to his right of making his selection in distinct half quarters, instead of being compelled to take it in one entire quarter of a section: & this must depend upon the provisions of the act of Congress of the sale of the public lands.

Before proceeding to give a construction to the acts, it is proper to remark, that as the preemption law, intended to confer a benefit, it should be construed favourably to those entitled to claim under it.
That they should be allowed to apply it, in the manner most advantageous to them, unless the words of the law admit of no doubt, or unless such construction, should contravene the general pollicy of the laws relating to the sales of the public lands, or should occasion, inconvenience, embarrasment or injury to the public interests.
It will be necessary to pass in review the various acts of Congress on the subject, some of which are to be regarded inpari materia" &
others as parts of the same acts, being made such, by express reference. The first, but imperfect outline, of our laws relating to the surveying, & sale of public lands, may be traced to the Ordinance of
1788 land laws 349.” The mode of laying them off in ranges &
townships, & the the subdivisions of townships into sections of a mile square, was then addopted; but the mode of selling them, afterwards underwent important changes, the most considerable of which, was the subdivisions of the sections & the price & the mode of payment.
At this period, townships & sectional townships, were offered for sale entire, while other were sold in lots of one mile square, which, as has been observed, was then the smallest subdivision. The sale of entire townships was discontinued, & there was a still further subdivision of the section. The range & township lines, became merely the means of a more perfect & regular division; but for the purpose of sales, the subdividing lines, whether actually marked, or only ideal, were those which governed.
The act of the 18" May 1796,” making some important alterations in the terms of sale, & in laying off the one half each township, into sections of 640 acres, each. Here is a change of names from lots to sections, but the thing is the same; that is a distinct portion of ground, capable of seperate designation or description. The act of the 18"
May 1800," directs a still further subdivision into half sections, &
that of the 26" March 1804 into quarter sections;" the half sections to be formed by lines running north & south, & the quarter sections by lines East & West, in the latter case dividing the section into 4
equal parts, each forming a lot or distinct portion of ground. In these minor subdivisions however, the law provides, that the lines
$7 On the same matter. -

shall be ascertained at the expense of the purchaser, the sectional lines only, being surveyed by the Government. It is evident from the act of the 11" February 1805 (Land laws 515) * that it was intended, that each subdivision, should form a distinct lot, as it is declared, that the half section, & quarter section, shall be held, &
considered, as containing a certain number of acres, whether the fact be so or not. The last and smallest subdivision, was required by the act of the 23"April 1820 (Land Laws 770) * & is that of half quarters by North & South lines drawn through the quarter sections. The act of 1805 is refered to & the new lot, or subdivision, is placed on the same footing with those that had been previously made. From that time, the public lands for the purpose of sale, have been considered as consisting of lots containing the Eighth part of a Section, or the half of a quarter Section. At the public sales, lands were required to be offered in lots of that discription, but at the private sales, which succeeded, the purchaser had his option to purchase entire sections, half sections, quarter sections, or half quarters, provided, he ebserved he observed the mode addopted, in the in the division of the section into its subordinate lots; that is, he could not take a half section, by a line drawn drawn East & West, or a half quarter by a similar line drawn across the quarter section.
It is now proper to proceed to the examination of so much of the act of Congress of April 1826 * commonly called the Florida preemption law, as relates to the subject before the Court.
This act refers to a similar one passed the 5" of February 1813 in favour of Illinois,” but previously to the subdivision, & sale of public lands in half quarters, & previously to the alteration in the price &
mode of selling. It is therefore not applicable in its literal extent, although expressly declared so, perhaps by the oversight or inattention of Congress, which might have precluded the doubt which has arisen in this case, by the simple addition of a few sentences. The act gives to the Florida setler, the right of preemption to a tract of land under “the same terms & restrictions, conditions, provisions &
regulations in every respect” as are directed by the law of Illinois.
But this must be understood to mean in conformity to the subsequent alterations in the general plan of the disposal of public lands. Two very important ones had been made, first, in the subdivisions of the quarter sections into half quarter sections, in the diminution of the price & in the denial of credit. If the law was taken literally, the
92.2 STAT. 313–314.

Florida setler would be required to pay $2 p" acre for his land, but with a credit & he would not be allowed to purchase less than a quarter section. This is not contended for, & it is admited that he may purchase in half Guarters. It is contended however, that according to the following clause in the Illinois law, he is precluded from selecting his half quarter, in the manner he claims to select in the present case, although any other purchaser, either at the public sales or afterwards at private sales might do so if he thought proper; which would be denying to him the right expressly given him—that of purchasing on the same terms of other purchasers, at public sale. The words of the law are as follows, “provided that no more than one quarter section of land shall be sold to any one individual in virtue of this act, & the same shall be bounded by the sectional & divisional lines run or to be run, under the direction of the Surveyor general, for the division of the public lands.” The Court considers the sectional & divisional lines, at the time of the passage of the law, to have meant, the lines bounding the lots of one mile square, the lines drawn from North to South, dividing these into half sections, & the East & West lines forming quarter sections. At that time a quarter section could not be purchased by taking one half on one side of any line, & another half on a difrent side, so as to constitute a quarter section in amount, but this can now be done in consequence of the present subdivisions. The object of the provision which has been quoted, was merely to confine the purchaser to the determinate portions, or lots, into which lands had been divided for the purpose of sale; that is to say, into sections, half sections & quarter sections; & is there any, reason, why any purchaser at the present time, unless expressly restricted, may not purchase a half quarter, in the same manner, that he could have purchased a quarter at the passage of the act? It was the policy of the general government to preserve the general plan by selling in distinct lots, & it is the only policy which the Court can discover. The clause which immediately preceeds the one first refered to, is that, which, in all probability was present to the mind of the person who prepared the Florida law, “every such person &c shall be entitled to the preference in becoming the purchaser from the United States of such tract of land at private sale, at the same price & on the same terms, & conditions in every respect as are or may be provided by law, for the sale of other lands sold in the said Territory at the time of making such purchase.”
The purchaser now, at private sale, can take in half quarters, either adjoining or otherwise, as he may think proper; but the Florida Setler is restricted by the expressions of the law, which give to him only the preemption of the tract of land which he has inhabited &

cultivated, & therefore in the opinion of the Court, the half quarter which he claims to purchase, must be contiguous to such tract of land, but in what relative position of contiguity does not seem material, so far as the government is concerned; although to him it may be highly important.
The Court is therefore of opinion that the setler is not bound to take his tract in one entire quarter section according to the law of Illinois, but may take it in seperate half quarters adjoining the tract which he has inhabited & cultivated, but without regard to sectional divisional lines excepting so far as they bound the half quarters.
The next question is as to the power of the Court to issue a mandamus in this case. The Court does not hesitate to say, that where a legal right is witheld, it ought to be inforced if this be within the power of the Court. It is admited that where an act is left to the discretion, that is, either to be done or omitted at the pleasure of the Agent, or where it is of a deliberative or juditial charactar, or where the Agent is acting under the immediate orders of a superior, the mandamus, is not a proper remedy. We do not however see the force of the reason, that in allowing the remedy, it will be to permit the government to be sued indirectly, when it cannot be sued directly.
We consider this as a suit of the government against its Agent, or rather a command to that Agent, to do the will & pleasure of the government, as announced in its statutes: & this through the organ created for the purpose of expounding & inforcing them. The Register & Reciever are the officers immediately directed by law to do these specific acts, & in relation to these they are not to be considered as acting under the orders of a superior. -
They are directed by law, to sell at private sale to any applicant, such of the public lands, as shall have been offered at public sale.
No discretion on Stieh ań such an application is allowed them. It is the absolute legal right of every one who has resolved to purchase. Can they be said to act in a judicial or deliberative capasity, in this case, or under the orders of a superior, or have they discretion to sell or not to sell, at their pleasure? The Court will admit, that in determining the right of the person claiming the preemption, which depends on evedence to be produced to them, they are required to deliberate, but in this case, the right having been ascirtained &
admited, the relator stands on the same footing with other persons, claiming to to purchase at private sale. If the question of selection depends upon the law, it is immaterial whether its construction offers a plain or a difficult case, its meaning must be refered to those whose province it is to give the legal exposition.

The last question before the court then is, whether the power is given to the superior courts of the Territory to issue writs of Mandamus in cases like the present. We think the power is so comprehensive as to apply in all cases. The power of Congress to confer it, cannot be doubted, & it is given without limitation or restriction.
We are therefore of opinion that the writ was properly issued by the Judge of the Superior Court.
(Drawn up by Judge Brackinridge as the opinion of the Court, Judge Smith concuring. But on after consideration it was resolved for various reasons, to hold the case under advisement)
The Register and Receiver of the Western Land District v. s. the United States 96
[No Date]
The Register and Receivers of the Western Land Dist. W. S. the U. S. by relation of Robinson and Swearingin.
The Relators claim under the Florida preemption law, the right to purchase, in addition to the quarter on which they are settled, two adjoining quarter Sections. The question arises under the third Section of the act of April 1826: this act provides that in case, “where two, or more persons entitled to the right of pre-emption, on one quarter, or fractional quarter of a section of land, they shall be authorised to purchase one, or more quarter Sections, which with the quarter Section, or fractional quarter section, shall be equally divided between them, in such manner as the Register and Receiver shall direct, so as to secure as far as may be practicable, to each, such person, their improvements respectively; provided, that in no instance, shall any person be entitled to a preference, in the purchase, for more than one quarter Section of land, in addition to the portion of the fractional quarter of a Section on which he is settled.””
The clause of the law of Illinois,” which declares that no more than one quarter of a Section shall be sold to any one individual, I consider inapplicable, because the Florida law presents a case not within the contemplation of that of Illinois; and it is moreover, admitted, that under the second Section of Florida law, if the Relators had been settled on a fractional quarter Section they would be entitled to two er Haere quarters besides the fractional quarter. The question must therefore, turn altogether, on the construction of the Florida law.
The intention of Congress, was to secure to the settler his improvements; this I think should not be lost sight of for a moment. The obscurity in the phraseology of the law, arises from the use of the

word they, instead of each, and the word fractional in the concluding part of the proviso. Is the latter, to be taken to mean only the legal fraction (a less quantity than one hundred and sixty acres) in the surveys? It is no doubt used in this sense in the third, as well as in the preceding section; but may it not also be used in a different sense by Congress? The act speaks of two, or more persons settled on a quarter, or a fractional quarter; it continues to declare that they, alluding to both, shall be authorised to purchase one, or more quarter sections upon which such persons shall be settled: which (thus still preserving the connection with the quarter Section, or fractional quarter Section) shall be equally divided &c. The mode of division, which was contended for as an argument against the settlers on an entire quarter, being each allowed to take an additional quarter, applies equally to two, or more settlers on a legal fraction. It was contended, that in the first case the only privilege of the two settlers, was to choose one adjoining quarter, and that the Register and Receiver would then divide the half Section between them: but the directions to those officers to act as umpires, and divider are the same in both cases. If the word fraction had been omitted in the latter part of the proviso, it would have been clear; it would then read thus; provided, that in no instance shall any person be entitled to a preference in the purchase for more than one quarter Section of land, in addition to his portion of the quarter Section in which he is settled.
Or, if the expression had been, in addition to his portion of the quarter Section or of the fractional quarter Section &c.
I can discover no reason why the two settles on what I have called the legal fractional quarter should have the privilege of purchasing, each another quarter, which would not apply to those settled on an entire quarter Section; but which, has been broken into actual fractions, by their respective improvements. These improvements are to be secured as far as may be practicable; and in order to do this, it may be necessary for Register and Reciever to allow to one settler a much larger portion of the quarter settled on, than to the other. I think there is therefore either an inaccuracy in the phraseology of the law, or the word fractional, is equally applicable to the case of the actual, or accident fraction, as to the legal fraction.
It seem to me, that the object of the law was to give to each settler, the pre-emption of a quarter Section at all events; but foreseening difficulties from conflicting settlements in the same quarter, or fractional quarter, it was thought advisable to throw this into the bargain, under the freindly umpirage the Register and Receiver. The term divided equally, does not necessarily refer to quantity: they are

explained by the subsequent expressions “so as to secure to each person, as far as practicable his improvements.
The impossibility of effecting a division on the principle contended for, without at the same time, disregarding the respective improvements, is a practical illustration of this view of the subject. Suppose A and B. settled on different sides of a quarter section; if a quarter be added on the side of A, how can the land be divided equally so as to give B, his improvements? It is, true the difficulty may be in some manner obviated, by allowing each to take an adjoining half quarter, or by telling them they must agree among themselves; but these are expedients; they are not constructions of the law, which is supposed to confer determinate rights.
That it was the intention of Congress to give to each of the settlers on an entire quarter Section, adjeihing an additional quarter section, is rendered perfectly satisfactory to my mind, by an exanimation of the pre-emption law of Missouri, which is a law in pari materia," and perhaps the law of which, that of Florida, was intended to have been a literal copy. Perhaps after all, the whole difficulty may have arisen from the mistake of a copying clerk. The expressions of the Missouri law, (passed 24 April 1816 land law 701) are therse, “That in cases where two, or more persons, entitled to the rights of preemption, shall be settled upon one quarter, or fractional quarter section of land, each person shall be authorised to purchase one, or more quarters.” The expressions in the law of Florida are precisely the same, with the exception of the word each, which in the Florida law, reads they. If the word each were inserted in the Florida law, the matter would be placed beyond a doubt. But I think the intention of Congress is sufficiently manifest, to warrant the court in taking the word they, to mean each, and to give the Relators two quarter sections in addition to the one on which they are settled, instead of giving them but one.
I acknowledge that the case presents, on mature reflection, greater difficulties, than at first occured to me; but in looking to the object of the law, which was to reward the enterprise of the early settlers, and the same time to secure to them the fruits of their labor, by allowing them their improvements, I can not entertain a different opinion.
I must here remark, that on the subject of the power to issue the mandamus, although perfectly satisfied on general principles, yet, in looking at the decisions of our Courts in the United States, I can discover a reluctance to assume it in these cases. For my own part, * On the same matter.

I am no stickler for prerogative. The very least among the absolute rights of the humblest individual has more respect in my eye than the most precious gem in the diadem of prerogative H. M. BRACKENRIDGE
No opinion was given by the Court in this case in consequence of the doubt on the subject of the right to issue the mandamus. The foregoing is in accordance with the opinion of Judge Woodward, who issued the mandamus, and from which the appeal was taken, or rather Writ of error.

<docbody>SIR I have the pleasure to inform you that the land cases in this district are progressing as rapidly towards a final termination as from their number and magnitude could reasonably be expected, in the investigation of these cases I have derived much aid from the compilation of Spanish law &c prepared by Col. White ” which our Court has decided may be read as authority in favour of as well as against the United States, this will be found a valuable work in those Countries where there are many titles to land derived from the Spanish Goverment, the materials of which it is composed are no where else to be found embodied in the same work & there are many of them which are no where else to be found in the English language. Col White suggested to me when he was here on his way to Washington City that he intended this Winter to add an appendix to this work consisting of all such additional Spanish laws ordinances &c as can be found and also the decisions of the Supreme Court upon questions arising under these laws and ordinances and under the Treaty of Cession such an appendix would add greatly to its value Gen Call who is now at Cuba will doubtless collect many valuable materials which it would be for the benefit of the United States to have published in such a work, & I would suggest the propriety of giving them that direction unless he should collect enough to form a book of themselves *—

I am Sir with great respect Yours &c THO DOUGLAS

& inclemency of the weather it will be necessary to postpone the completion of the work untill April next—As most of the work which has now to be performed is in the mud & at low water mark; I have deemed the extension of the time requested as very reasonable; as unnecessary expense of his laborors may thereby be avoided and a greater period allowed to judge of the effect of the currents upon the banks of the canal excavated and to apply hereafter the proper remedy *

SIR, Your several communications on the subject of the Surveys binding on the Escambia R. (particularly that of the 26th Ulto. with explanations,”) leave me conclusively to believe that great error has been made in those surveys, or that they have not been platted correctly from the field notes, I have therefore to observe that the incongruities in relation to them, must be in some manner reconciled.
The fractional Townships on each side of the Escambia must be laid down in connection with that River, in conformity to the present marks & bounds whatever may be their relative position on each side of the River.—Altho' always desireable yet it is not indispensably necessary that the Township corners and lines on the East of the River should correspond with those on the West, but it is essentially necessary that the surveys should be exhibited on the plats precisely as they have been executed, on the ground, exhibiting all their discrepancies, if there be any. If the lines have been actually & accurately run, and the Townships platted from the field notes, there can be no difficulty in doing this, and making a proper connection of the surveys with the River & with each other, but if the work upon the ground has been improperly executed, or if the platting has not been accurately made from correct field notes, then the necessity of correcting the error, wherever it may be, is evident—
If there should be more land to be sectioned between the two opposite surveys, they should bear a following number to the highest in the Township to which they may be attached. And should errors be discovered in the surveys already existing they should be corrected without altering the Sectional numbers as originally marked
& called for, on the ground.—
I beg leave to refer you to my several letters on the subject of these surveys.

I shall transmit your acc’ts to the 1st Auditor of the Treasury Dept. for settlement. Those vouchers charging doubtful surveys will be suspended agreeably to my communication of the 9th September last"

<docbody>HONBle JO” M WHITE
DEAR SIR I had the pleasure of receiving per last mail, your favor of the 28” Ult° on the subject of donations of land." I thank you for the information communicated; & will esteem it an additional favor to be hereafter apprized of the probability of the law passing.
During the past week I have explored the river Waucissa,” from its source, (3 miles SW of my house) to its confluence with the Ausilla;
& thence to the Gulph. For a distance of four miles before joining the Ausilla, the Waucissa spreads out into a large swamp; with a multiplicity of branches of various sizes. Some of these branches enter the Aussilla above the natural bridges, which obstruct that river in its passage to the sea—others disappear under the earthand only some of the smaller ones keep above the surface, & finally conduct into tide water. There will be difficulty in obtaining a boat navigation—nevertheless it may be affected by throwing several of these branches together, & deepening & widening one of the channels.
The excavations will sometimes be in mud—sometimes in rock—
and the saw & axe will be as much employed, as any other instrument, to remove logs which seem to have been embedded in the swamp, at some remote period. I believe however that with an expenditure of three or four thousand dollars, a good navigation for boats drawing two feet water, may be be obtained from the Source of the Waucissa to the Gulph. The distance in a straight line about 20 miles. With such a navigation, a land carriage of 18 miles would be saved to all the country north & east of the Waucissa—& to those as far west as

Col° Murat. The Monticello district would be as much benefitted as any other. At present the settlers as far east as Hickstown trade to Magnolia; & to these there w” be a saving of land carriage of 18
miles. A town w” grow up at the head of the Waucissa with which we would all trade.
Will it be practicable to get an appropriation of money to enable us to effect this desireable object? “Uncle Sam” is also deeply interested in it. The U. States have much land yet to bring into market in the fifth Range North of the Base line; & also the country from the head of the Waucissa to the Gulph. This latter district of country so immediately interested in this improvement is 18 miles in length;
nowhere less than two miles wide; & for the greater part of the distance I believe it to be six miles wide. The proposed improvement w" quadruple the value of this land; much of which is of good quality, & all of it well timbered.
If an appropriation in money cannot be obtained, would it not be possible to get a donation in lands? A donation of some five or six sections of land, with the priviledge of locating them in parcels of a quarter section, would probably enable us to accomplish the object.
Indeed I am so deeply interested in having the work done immeditealy, that I would at once undertake it this—werk, myself, for such a remuneration. It is all important to those of us who have sugar crops, to have a water conveyance, instead of land carriage.
I will be happy to hear from you on this subject; & am now looking for the promised letter communication from “A looker on in Venice”.—
M” G & myself tender our sincere gratulations upon the perfect restoration of M*W* health. It will afford us the greatest pleasure to see you both at Waukeenah.
Yours Sincerely JOHN G GAMBLE

Memorial to the President by Citizens of the Territory
[February 1, 1830]
To His Excellency Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of America—
We the undersigned citizens of the County of Leon and Territory of Florida represent with the greatest respect to your Excellency that Middle Florida in general is distinguished by a paucity of streams of running water of a volume and permanency of supply suitable to mills and other machinary propelled by water. This is eminently and peculiarly the character of the County in which your petitioners reside, and the consequence is a great scarcity of lumber. The few streams of the requisite size and seats for mills, in a County forty miles in length by thirty in breadth, are with two exceptions found only within the limits of Forbes purchase, On this purchase and at points accessible to the citizens of Tallahassee and its vicinity, exist seats which have been improved for the purpose of supplying, the necessities of the public They are uniformly surrounded by large tracts of sterile land, covered with a growth of pine which cannot be destroyed for ages, and the use of which can in no manner lessen the value of the land. Your petitioners beg permission, most respectfully to state to your Excellency. that the District Attorney of the United States, for the District of Middle Florida has obtained from the Judge of the said District a writ of injunction directed to certain proprietors of saw mills, in Forbes purchase suspending their opperrations indefinitely—and forbidding them to use pine timber, growing on any of the public lands*—Your petitioners believe there

is no law of the General Government, prohibiting the use of such timber for purposes solely of domestick application They understand in the neighbouring state of Alabama the practice is universally tolerated, That no citizen or community, has been denied a similar accommodation when the object has been confined to domestic supply and they solemnly declare their belief, that no lumber within the said County of Leon has ever been sawed for any other purpose, that none has ever been exported nor was any ever prepared with that view, To inform your Excellency, that the use of these seats—
and the pine timber in their vicinity are essential to their accommodation and convenience; that they are indispensible to the wants of this youthful community still struggling with most of the hardships incident to the first settlement of a new country, will be sufficient to procure a revocation of the orders under which the District Attorney has acted. They are willing even to go farther, and pronounce the measure impolitic even if the Government act, with a view singly to the value of their own property supposing them to be proprietors of said purchase; for they entertain no doubt, that these mills add decidedly to the value of the lands included within its limits, Your petitioners believing that your Excellency is guided by a liberal and enlighten’d policy—withetit the shaallest stain er timeture ef the sinister eehsideratieh ef pelities whieh usually Haingles se mueh in the measures ef a Perritory—appeal with the greatest confidence to your generosity, and solicit the interposition of their respected chief magistrate to grant them the necessary relief.

<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled.
The Memorial of the Mayor and aldermen of the city of S*Augustine Respectfully Sheweth, That there are several lots in this city belonging to the United States, from which your Memorialists believe the Government derives no manner of benefit, and for which, they therefore venture to think, it has no use. These lots have been in the possession of the Military of this post since the cession of the Country to the United States, and your Memorialists are not aware that any of them have, since that event, been used for any public purpose—That they are not so now, and have not been so for a great length of time past, your Memorialists are authorized to affirm.
Besides the lots above referred to as being in the possession of the Military, there is one, called the Old Hospital lot, which has been for several years past, and is now, under the directions of the Government, in the possession and use of the Corporation of this city.
From it a small annual revenue of about sixty dollars is derived by the city.
The Old Hospital and Smith's lots are the only ones which can be considered as having improvements of any value on them. They have each a building on them, but in a state of great dilapidation from the want of necessary repairs. They are consequently of little value and in a course of rapid deterioration. The greater number of lots belonging to the Government stand in conspicuous parts of the City, and from their neglected, ruinous, and unimproved condition, affect very prejudicially its appearance and well being.
Your Memorialists influenced by these considerations, and the great need which this city stands in of the bounty of the Government, earnestly pray your Honorable Bodies to be pleased to grant these lots (which are particularly described in a schedule hereto subjoined)
to the Corporation of this City. There are many Objects in and about this city demanding, and well worthy of, improvement; but which from its very limited resources are wholly beyond attainment.
The donation which Your Memorialists humbly presume to request at your hands would go far towards enabling the city to accomplish them, and would in many other respects be of great importance and benefit to it.—
Relying on the munificence of your Honorable Bodies for a favor-

able reception of this their petition your Memorialists as in the duty bound will ever pray &"

17 March MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF THE TERRI- TORY
<source>[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[Referred March 2, 1830]</place-time>
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the undersigned, Citizens of the Territory of Florida, Humbly Represent, That the Government of the United States have at all times considered it important to protect every branch of the public expenditure with a view to economy and particularly in the Management of the mail department, to observe the means by which the great ends of the Common good may be protected is all important to the prosperity of the Country. Your memorialists in making this appeal to your Honorable body believe they will not be charged with too great bias, influenced by individual interest or feeling, but on the contrary, the prominent and leading features of this Memorial will tend to promote the Commercial interests at large, independent of any immediate local advantages to your memorialists.
Your memorialists would therefore most respectfully represent, that under the present Mail arrangement to Tallahassee the Seat of Government, your Memorialists are only entitled to a mail a week arriving at the latter place every Monday. This Mail is transported from Augusta to Tallahassee via Milledgeville and Hartford in the County of Pulaski, Georgia: and, your Memorialists believe there can be no good reason assigned why the mail should not come direct from Augusta to Tallahassee, when it can be transported from the latter place saving a distance of seventy five miles. Your memorialists further represent, that looking to the actual difference in the distance and at the same time to the superiority of one route over the other, they humbly apprehend, it is equivalent to One hundred miles in favour of the route direct from Augusta: And your memorialists further represent that there are only two post offices between Milledgeville and Hartford, at which point the mail strikes the direct route from Augusta to Tallahassee, passing over a broken and hilly country, presenting many formidable obstacles as a carriage highway, such as bad roads and Water Courses, all of which are encountered

merely to meet the Convenience of the community between Milledgeville and Hartford which could be effectuated by a Horse mail from the former to the latter place.
Your memorialists further represent that under the present mail arrangement they labor under the most serious difficulties. From their geographical situation, they are cut off from the best and easiest communications through which to extend their Commercial relations, and they humbly hope that the Mail route may be changed so as to meet the interests and convenience of your Memorialists, and further pray that the mail may be transported twice a week direct from Augusta which will tend to extend to this Community a more direct and safe intercourse with their neighbors.—
And your Memorialists further represent, having an eye to the Commercial importance of Havanna immediately in our neighborhood, the Government of the United States must be alive to the growing and existing relations between that great Commercial depot and the Cities of every part of our Union. Your memorialists generally indulge in the hope, and humbly suggest that the establishment of a direct mail route from Augusta to S' Marks, Middle Florida, and from thence to Havanna via Key West” would not only tend to facilitate Commercial intercourse, but go far to aid and strengthen the revenue of this government. Your memorialists do not entertain a doubt when the mail route from Augusta to S' Marks direct comes to be enquired into by the proper Department, it will be found that the mail can be transported to Tallahassee in four days, which would make ten days from the seat of our Federal Government, whereas by the present arrangement, fifteen days are consumed.
And your Memorialists further represent, and it is the opinion of persons intimately acquainted with the navigation of the Gulf of Mexico and its tributary Waters, that three Mail boats fitted up for passengers, to ply between S. Marks and Havanna via Key West would meet the most decided encouragement and not cost the Government more than ten thousand dollars per annum, which sum your Memorialists verily believe would be covered by postage receipts in behalf of the Mail revenue. By the present Contract, your Memorialists learn, that the annual sum of Twenty five hundred dollars or more is paid over and above the receipts of the Post office Department. Your memorialists further represent there can be no doubt but that the Spanish authorities would readily enter into an arrangement so reciprocal and so highly advantageous to the merchants of their own provinces and calculated to produce that mercantile intercourse and interchange so highly beneficial to trade; and indeed as

your Memorialists are informed that at this day the Spanish authorities permit the mail packets of other nations to enter the Port of Havanna free of charges.—
Your memorialists further represent, that the Island of Key West is assuming an important attitude, & whether viewed in the light of a Commercial, military or naval depot, it must ere long be considered as the key to the Gulf of Mexico so far forth at least as the American trade is concerned. Your memorialists would respectfully suggest from the growing consequence of Key West it concerns the government and deeply interests your Memorialists in having a certain and permanent communication with that place, and amongst other reasons your Memorialists would suggest at this time, that altho’
Key West is protected by the Judicial and Executive arms of the Federal & Territorial Governments it cannot be approached with any degree of certainty, but all is left to hazard and doubt. In tender Consideration whereof, and for the reasons set forth by your Memorialists, they humbly pray that this their Memorial may receive the mature Consideration of your Honorable body.” &° &”

have passed over this bar, and that at this time there are seven sail of Wessels in this Harbour, ready for Sea; We therefore respectfully request your honorable body to pass a law for the erection of a Light House, on South side of Musquito Inlet, and placing Buoys on the Bar, and your memorialists as in duty bound will ever &c NEW SMYRNA.

The above account having been submitted for Payment, I deem it my duty as the Executive of Florida to report the facts, connected with the same, and under the circumstances to give my cirtificate in favour of the payment of the account—
The Laws of the Territory of Florida have heretofore been regularly published in the Pensacola Gazette, and the Legislative Council, by a resolution passed the 20" of October 1829, required the laws passed at that Session to be published in the news papers of the Territory—
authorised to Publish the laws of the United States—The Pensacola Gazette is one of these papers—The Legislative council afterwards on the 21" day of Nov” 1829 the last day of its Session passed another resolution, restricting the Publication of the laws to a single paper

printed at the seat of Government (Tallahassee) called the Floridian and Advocate I W* P. Duval Governor of the Territory of Florida cirtify that the laws were published by the said Thomas M Blount Editor of the Pensacola Gazatte under the first resolution of the Legislative council
& that I have examined a file of his papers to assertain this fact.
I further cirtify it does not appear that Thomas M. Blount had any notice of the second resolution, untill the laws had been published—
His account for printing of the Laws ought therefore to be paid, and the number of pages charged for is correct at the price amounting to Two hundred and eight Dollars seventy five cents is the usual and reasonable sum heretofore allowed to other printers for the same service *

<dochead>RICHARD K. CALL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE</dochead>
<source>[NA:SD, Fla. Archives: ALS]</source>
<place-time>TALLAHASSEE Mar. 28. 1830.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In my last " I promised to furnish a more full report of my proceedings as Special Agent of the United States in the Island of Cuba, which I have now the honour to submit.
Finding it impossible to proceed to Havanna until after the commencement of the Sickly Season of the last year, with the permission of the President my visit was postponed until Subsequent to that period. I left home on the 22" of December and arrived at Havanna on the 5th January last. On the 6th. I addressed an Official note to the Captain General informing him of my arrival and requesting an interview with him.” On the 7th I was verbally informed through the American Consul M Shaler, that the Cap. General would see me on the 9th. of January. Deeming this mode of communication unusual and disrespectful, I declined the interview and addressed him an other note accompanied with your letter, which I was charged to deliver to him. An answer to my Second note was given, and soon after a reply to your letter which is herewith enclosed was sent to me. Thus situated I did not call on the Cap. General, until I had been waited on by his public interpreter, and furnished with a full Explanation, and apology, for the manner in which I had been received. I then accepted an invitation to wait on him, and after presenting my commission from the President of the United States, I
demanded such original documents relating to the land claims in

Florida as might exist in the Archives of Havanna. To this he replied that he had he pewer te deliver them withetit the speejal eréler ef the King but he premised te fürnish me with Cepies ef stieh as +
Paight designate; all the papers belonging to the Archives of Florida had been delivered at the surrender of the Country, and that there were none remaining within his government. On being assured to the contrary he observed that he was the mere military Commander of the Island, and had no power to deliver the original papers without the orders of his government, but that he would with great pleasure furnish me with copies of such as I might designate, I then addressed him a letter a Copy of which N° 1 is herewith enclosed, to this I received for answer that he had given the necessary orders to the different departments of his government to furnish the copies required. After the procrastination and delay common to those people, the Original title papers in the care of Aradondeau " & Son, John Forbes & Co west of the Appalachicola Panton Leslie & C° and John Forbes &
C° and John Forbes individually were produced. When the Copies were nearly completed I had an opportunity of seeing the originals, which I found to vary so materially from the Copies on which the claimants has founded their actions, I considered their production at the trial indispensably necessary for the defence of the United States.
And I determined notwithstanding the former refusal of the Cap.
General to renew my demand of the original. This I did in a letter of 16th. feby. a copy of which N° 2 is herewith enclosed" and after much difficulty and delay succeeded in attaining them.
The original deed from the Indians to John Forbes & Co." Conveying the land on which fort S" Marks is situated, and which was then garrisoned by the troops of Spain, is signed by twelve obscure individuals, most of whom resided within the limits of the Creek nation north of the 31st degree of latitude. The Consideration for which the sale was made is still blank in the Original, though the Copy filed by the claimants is filled up with the sum of $19,387.4% Reals. The deed to Panton Leslie & Co is more formal, but is liable to the following objections it was made subsequent to the death of Panton and Leslie.
It purports to have been made by the Seminole Indians in consideration of the debts due by them to the said house, But the list of debtors as well as those who signed the deed there shew that they belonged to the Indian towns within the limits of the United States, the confirmation by Governor Folch” of both these claims covering near

two million of acres of land is evidently spurious. But even if it was genuine, I have obtained the most conclusive proof of the total want of power in Gov. Folch to confirm those grants. The second grant to John Forbes & C° is estimated to contain one and a half million of acres, but from the boundaries Extending from the Appalachicola to the River Choctawhatchee and presenting a part front on the Sea Coast of more than a hundred miles it must contain nearly double that quantity. It purports to have been granted by the Cap" General of Cuba in consideration of losses said to have been sustained by the said house. This grant bears upon its face the most conclusive evidence of its fraudulent character. The original dates have been erased and others inserted, in order to bring it within provisions of the
8th, Article of the treaty which renders good all grants made subsequent to the 24th. day of Jany. 1818. The grant to John Forbes individually is for an Island in the River Appalachicola said to contain
7,000 acres. This depends alone on a deed of gift from a few of the Indians most of whom lived north of the 31st. degree of latitude, and never was formally confirmed Felek by Governor Folch or any other authority of the Spanish Government.
The grant to Arredondo and Son for 24 miles square genuine, but was made on Conditions that the grantees should settle on the land two hundred Spanish families, the settlements to be commenced within three years from the date of the grant. These conditions have never been Complied with, and the grant must be considered valid. I
obtained Copies of several other documents, relative to the power of the officers of Spain to make grants of land in Florida This was accomplished by employing the keepers of the Archives to search for them privately, and after I had paid for and obtained the Copies, I
procured the authentication of the Cap. General, in every instance where I asked for documents, without having first seen them, I was informed by the Cap. General that they could not be found.
His reluctance to afford any facility to the United States in the investigation of these matters was evinced on all occasions, but in the instance in which I asked for a copy of a letter from Gov. Zespedez."
of East Florida to Gov. Oneill” of West Florida, his unwillingness was more particularly manifested. A copy of this letter with the Certificate of the Cap. General Annexed, had been filed by the claimants in the Case of John Forbes & Co from its phraseology I believed it to be spurious, and I asked for a copy with a view of detecting a fraud, but I was informed by the Cap. General that no such letter could be found in the Archives. The lands granted to Forbes & Co is situated

principally in East Florida, and one of the objections to the grant is What it was made by Gov. Folch of West Florida. The letter above Whentioned states that the jurisdiction of West Florida had been
\xtended from the Appalachicola to St. Marks river, which would
\ring the land granted within the jurisdiction of Gov. Folch. I am Convinced that the Copy filed by the claimants is faithless, and I
Welieve the Cap. General was unwilling to Expose the fraud. To his note N° 3.” informing me that this letter could not be found I addressed him another letter a Copy which is herewith Enclosed N° 4"
To this he replied N° 5" that he had ordered the search for this document to be renewed and if found a Copy should be sent to me.
See a Gepy ef this letter N° 4.
There was another instance in which his prejudices in behalf of the claimants was clearly exhibited. A Commission had been sent out to Examine witnesses in the Island of Cuba. It appears to be a regulation of that government that no public officer can be examined as a witness in any case without first obtaining the permission of his immediate Chief. I had been present when one of the claimants applied to the Cap. General for permission to Examine three witnesses which was granted without a moments delay. Some time after I addressed him a note a Copy of which N° 6" is Enclosed asking permission to Examine an individual in behalf of the United States.
This application was referred to the Kings Attorney for an opinion, who stated in reply that I could only Examine the witness before the Cap. General, which he communicated in a letter of 4th March, a Copy of which N° 7. is also Enclosed,” to this I addressed him a letter of which N° 8* is a copy and which closed my correspondence with him.
I feel confident that I have procured every thing necessary for the defence of the United States in the cases above mentioned But there are many documents belonging to the Archives of Florida, still remaining in the different departments of the Government at Havanna which may be of great importance to the government as well as our citizens. They were ceeded to the United States with the territory of Florida, and ought to be placed in our possession, I would therefore respectfully Suggest the propriety of instructing our Minister at the Court of Spain to apply for instructions to the Cap. General to deliver those documents to the Authirized agent of the United

States. To the demands hitherto made by our Government they have replied that all the documents and Archives were delivered when Florida was Surrendered to the United States, But this statement is incorrect for I have Seen and Examined privately a number of those documents and with the knowledge I now possess of their situation I
feel well convinced that I could with the proper authority easily procure them, and I would willingly undertake it, if this measure should be adopted. I found the Cap. General extremely unwilling to enter into a correspondence with me, and in no instance did he ever reply to one of my letters without first consulting the other authorities of the Island as you will perceive from his answers. This reluctance I
understand was created by the publication of his correspondence with Mr. Cook " the former Agent of the United States in Cuba which gave him much uneasiness, and produced some difficulty with his government.
Enclosed you will find my account current with the United States,”
Both my Expences and the time which I was Engaged in performing this duty had greatly exceeded my Expectations, but I have the satisfaction of knowing that I used every economy of both time and money—and that the object of my mission could not have been accomplished with a Smaller expenditure of Either *

Extract of a letter from Jesse H. Willis Agent for Superintending the removal of obstructions in the River and Harbour of S’ Marks, Florida.
“The Appropriation for the improvement of the Harbour & removal of obstructions in the River S." Marks will not more than defray the expenses of the necessary preparations—Flat boats must be built and a Dredging Machine provided which will nearly exhaust the present appropriation, & if a larger sum is not obtained at this Session of Congress we shall lose the next fall & winter which are the proper seasons for operations—A further appropriation of ten or twelve thousand dollars will be indispensable, say ten thousand—when the rapidly increasing commerce of this Port is considered; & the difficulty of its navigation understood.

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs, 13" April, 1830.</place-time>
<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY William P. Duval, Tallahassee, Florida.
Sir, The President and Secretary of War are both anxious to promote the welfare of the Indians by every means in their power. They believe amongst the best means of accomplishing this is to educate, and improve their children. This course has been pursued with the Choctaws and Creeks and Chickasaws and Potawatimies and others with great effect. Children of all these and other tribes have been put to school and educated, and learned to speak our language, and then on their return have been able to transact business for their tribes, and confer great benefits upon them.
By the treaty with the Florida Indians of 18* September 1823, a provision was made for the purposes of education," and to carry it into effect, Congress appropriated the sum of one thousand Dollars a year, for the term of twenty years;"no part of it appears to have been drawn, except the allowance for 1825," and that was not used for the purpose intended, and for which it was sent. It is believed the Florida Indians could by your influence be induced to second the wishes of

the President in the education of their children, especially as it will cost them nothing. They would give great pleasure to the President and Secretary of War, if they would, as it would evince their wisdom, and shew that they were anxious to promote the welfare and happiness of their children. I write therefore by direction of the Secretary of War to get you to explain fully to the Florida Indians this important subject that the amount now due under the provision of the Treaty, as well as that which will become due, may be employed, under the direction of the President for the object for which it was provided.
You will know how to introduce this subject, and convince them of its importance— For after all, the greatest benefits which we can bestow on the Indians, is to enlighten and improve their Children, and Qualify them to be of use to themselves and their tribes. This is considered a very important object, and as such your particular attention is called to it. Much can be done by you in effecting this humane object; and much is looked for to be done. I am aware of the prejudices of these people, and how hard it is to fix their attention upon such an object—but by patient instruction and counsel, much can be effected.
It would be very useful to have all these tribes represented at one common school. They would form friendships, and go home, and be able to allay much of the excitement which a want of better acquaintance occasions; and mutually benefit each other's tribes &c. &c.
The President would no doubt prefer to have these children sent to the school in Kentucky, called the Choctaw Academy, and which is located at the Blue Springs in Kentucky, the residence of Col° R. M.
Johnson. This school is under the particular regulations of the President of the United States, and if children are there, they will be under his most immediate care.
If the Indians shall consent to send their children eight boys between the ages of 10 & 14 may be sent, and sent immediately. Their expenses and the expenses of the person who may take them to Kentucky will be paid by your bill on the Department of War—Where it is possible, to get them, vouchers will be expected for their expenses.
The number viz: 8 will be kept up for 5 years, after which period, the number will be reduced to 4—and so continued for 8 years until the annuity will expire in 1843.”
Very respectfully &c.
THO" L. M“KENNEY.

<place-time>Tallahassee FLORIDA 13" April 1830</place-time>
<docbody>GEORGE GRAHAM Esq Commiss" of the Gen' Land Office SIR, I feel it my duty to Communicate to you, that in the large grant made to John Forbes & Co. West of the Appalachacola & East of the Choctawhatchy Rivers,” now claimed by John & James Innerarity, and now pending in the Superior Court for the Western District, under the Act of 23* May 1828.” We have detected, by means of an original document, brought from Havanna by Gen' R. K.
Call, the grossest attempt, to impose upon the government by fraud and forgery, that has ever been develloped in this Country. Erasures, and alterations of dates, are so palpable, that is only necessary to see an examine the document, to be convinced that it is base attempt to bring the grant within the provissions of the Treaty, by antedating it, & by other alterations equally palpable and material.-
The document in question is the original petition of John Forbes to the Captain Gen' soliciting the lands, his (the Cap" Genls) order referring it, to the Surveyor Gen' and to the Kings attorney, and their Seperate reports thereon, and finally the grants, in the usual form;
Signed by the Captain Gen". All that part of the petition of Forbes, which refers to and speaks of the boundary of the lands he Solicits, as well as that part of the grant which refers to the same matter, has been taken out, and other Sheets introduced, as is evidenced by the difference in the ink, the hand writing, the Stamp of the paper, the mis Spelling of John Forbes name (which is throughout spelled John Farbes), beside many other marks apparent upon upon inspection which leave no doubt upon my mind, but that it is Spurious.
The claimants brought suit upon a copy, properly certified, which is entirely fair upon its face, alledgeing that the original belonged to the Archives at Havanna, and that they could not obtain it, that the U. States Should obtain it if it was desired, that the Government could demand it from the Spanish Gov" as a document belonging to Florida, which they as individuals would have no right to do, &c.
This grant is supposed contain near 1,500000 acres, including a great extent of Sea Coast, and some of the finest Bays & harbors on the Florida Coast, with many thousand acres of verry fine lands, which probable but for the accidental discovery of this document would have been lost to the U. States.
The object of this communication is to suggest that the original

record (expediente) should be in all cases produced by the claimants and filed.—I feel convinced, that in most cases where copies only have been produced, that the original would detect fraud either in the quantity, the location, or something else equally important for the interest of the Gov". All the papers relating to grants of lands in Florida belong to the U. States and she has a right to demand them of Spain. Individuals have not this right, and therefore they offer certified copies, & require the Gov' to obtain the originals, as she alone has the right to demand them. I would therefore suggest the propriety of a Special Mission to Havanna, with authority to demand all papers of whatever discription, which properly belong to the Archives of Florida, under the treaty of 22" Feb 1819, and that in the mean time, the trial of all cases now pending under the Act of 23" May 1828,”
in Florida, where the originals have not been produced, be suspended until they are produced, or until the return of the Agent sent out for the purpose aforesaid. I make this Sugestion under a thorough conviction that the interest of the U. States would be materially subserved by the production of the original papers in several of the cases now pending in Florida. I would be pleased to hear from you as early as convenient upon the subject of this communication.”

<place-time>PENSACOLA April 18" 1830–</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR—I learn with pleasure that an appropriation of two thousand dollars has been made by Congress, to carry the military road from Alaqua to Mariana." Having taken much interest in this road from the commencement, it being a favorite object with me to see a mode of passing from New Orleans to the North, without being obliged to go round the peninsula of Florida by sea, or to go high up through Alabama, through a hilly, or rather broken country, and unhealthy. It is a singular fact, that on the line of this road from Mobile to Pensacola, and thence to Tallahassee, the country is remark-

able for its health throughout the year. It is neither flat nor hilly, but finely watered, consisting of open pine woods crossing the main trunks of the water courses, instead of their numerous branches higher up the country. I speak with confidence when I assure you that all travellers will prefer this route from N. Orleans, as soon as it will be completed. Since I had the pleasure of seeing you, the two appropriations, that for a road from this place to Mobile, and from this to Alaqua, have been expended. I have not travelled the road to Mobile, on which a stage now runs once a week, but it is spoken of in very high terms by those with whom I have conversed, and it is said to be equal to any northern turnpike. I have no hesitation in saying that a stage might run in a day and part of a night to Pascagoula, and taking the steam boat, passengers might go thence to New Orleans in twelve hours. I have travelled the road to Alaqua, and I can assure you it is well executed—it will require little or no repair for twenty years: the causays, will last forever, and the bridges are constructed of light wood, that is of yellow pines, which have been dead perhaps for fifty years, have dropped all their sap, and having been scorched by fires when they stood, when cut down, they are composed entirely of resin, and possess a specific gravity greater than water: in fact the wood sinks like iron or lead. This wood is almost imperishable.
There is now twenty five miles of fine stage road, which may with ease be travelled in a day. The only defects are, that the stumps on the old military road are cut too lew high, and one of the fords is too steep for carriages, that of Clear creek. There is still one stream, that of little Alaqua, which wants a bridge, it will be a weeks work for five hands. The instructions which were given by you, in relation to the materials of the bridges, have had a most excellent effect, and I have no doubt that in future, all the military roads will be constructed in the same way. I am deeply impressed with the importance of this road. The mere transportation of troops is not the only military use;
eehsiderable the transportation of the mail, and the certain and rapid communication of intelligence from the Seat of government to the extreme Southern frontier, are of the highest importance in time of war.
I speak with perfect confidence when, I say, that it is practicable, to form a communication by this route, which will enable the govent to transmit intelligence to New Orleans, regularly in twelve days.
Capt. Burch before leaving this place put into my hands the sum of 1403 to be expended in completing the road to Alaqua. I have just returned from that place, having eempletd—the built a bridge over the Alaqua of three Arches, and one over Jones' Creek, the first is seventy five feet in length, the other forty. The timber is of the very best kind-superior I believe to any on the road. In fact, I have

taken unusual pains. The Alaqua is the principal stream between Pensacola, and Chactahatchy. Besides making the bridges, I have made fords across two streams on this side of Rock Creek, where Capt: Burch left off, but one of them, (Little Alaqua) requires a bridge; having already expended forty or fifty dollars etight out of my own pocket, in addition to the sum left with me, besides giving my personal attention, it would not be reasonable to expect me to do the work. I have cut about two miles of road through thick hammocks, among large trees of every kind, which is very different from cutting in the open pine woods, where there may not be tree to cut in two hundred yards. I have employed persons to cut about an equal number of miles in the pine woods.
When I admit that the road was well made by Cap. Burch, I must also state the truth, although not for the purpose of complaining of him, and I do not wish anything I may say will to be regarded in that light, Capt. Burch never saw the road but once, which may be excusable on account of his having other duties to perform: but he had favorites and relations to serve. The compensation allowed the Superintendant, if I am correctly informed was eleven dollars a day—
five for his personal services, and six for his cart and horses, which were provided with provender at Publick expense. I am also told that the negroes of his father in law M* Bellamy were paid from fifteen to seventeen dollars a month, and were found in provisions from Pensacola, when they might have been obtained cheaper in the country.
Fifteen dollars and found, is the usual wages at the publick works, and in this neighborhood, because there are many reasons why owners of slaves do not like to employ them on the publick works, one of them is the habits which they are apt to acquire—and free white laborers are very unwilling to be employed then among slaves. But this is not the case in the interior, when the slaves are employed near their homes, and not usually separated from their families. Laborers enough can be had at fifteen dollars and find themselves. I have had no difficulty in doing so, and can procure any number that may be wanted. I have found it more advantageous and economical to make specific contracts where I could: for instance, the frame of the bridges of Alaqua was furnished for forty dollars, that of Jones' Creek for twenty five, and the hauling cost about twelve, at 175cts per day for oxen and driver. Besides it is worthy the consideration of the government, that by the distribution of small sums in this way among worthy and industrious people, much good is done to them and to the country at large. I am therefore not satisfied with the manner in which the money has been expended by Capt Burch. I could have done all the work he has done for half the amount. The present

Quarter Master, Cap. Shannon,” I believe is a different kind of man—
he has no individual views or friends to serve. Although but slightly acquainted with him, I am confident he will have a single eye to his duty.
I am aware that there is a delicacy in permitting any interference with the duties of an Officer, who is responsible to his superior for the faithful discharge of them. Yet, if it can be done without infringing upon this rule of propriety, I should like much to have something to say in the making of this important link of the road from Alaqua to Mariana. I have traversed the country so often, and have thought so much on the subject, that I can be of use to Capt" Shannon, in assisting to select the ground for the road, and would cheerfully lend my personal assistance in exploring it. Capt. Shannon cannot be so intimately acquainted with the Country. The selection of the ground from Alaqua to Hard Labour, a distance of forty five miles, is of great importance and is very difficult—and on the proper selection of this part of the road, will almost depend the value of the read rest.
The Chactahatchy, has the worst swamp of any river in America, it is the great obstacle to the whole road—yet I think it may be overcome—it is low, wide, and cut up with deep slues. I presume Capt"
Shannon would not feel himself treated with disrespect, if it were intimated to him, to avail himself of my assistance, voluntarily tendered by me, in selecting the route, at least the crossing place of the Chactahatchy"—
I am, Sir, With Great respect Your Most Ob*S*

The Petition of the undersigned inhabitants of St Augustine respectfully represents. That they are desirous of establishing in that City a High School for the education of children of both Sexes in the higher branches of Literature Antient and modern languages &c.
That in order to effect this object, they find it necessary to ask assistance of General Government in supplying a lot of ground &c. The lot formerly occupied by the Spanish Goverment for a collectors office lies vacant, except the old walls which are a nuisance to the City, and wholey useless to the Goverment.
They respectfully pray that Congress will Consider that the Eastern District of Florida is so much covered with spanish grants that little if any land remains for the use of schools. That these have not been surveyed and from their inferior quality, may never, or at least not for a long time here, be surveyed. The old inhabitants, and the native americans, are different in manners customs and language and never can be cordially united untill the youth of all all denominations shall be educated together. Our City can never become a place of extensive commerce. But the salubrity of the Climate and beauty of situation, have already rendered it a favorite resort for emigrants and invalids from various parts of the United States. To them it would be particularly desirable to educate ther children where they chose to reside.
For these and various other reason they pray your honorable body to grant to them the Lot of ground above described, and they will pray &c.

HON SAM D INGHAM Treasury Sir, In reply to the Resolution of the Senate of the U.S. bearing date the 26th Ulto in the words following to wit:—
“Resolved.—That the Secretary of the Treasury be requested to inform the Senate, whether any of the Land lately sold in Florida, was returned on the Survey as Swamp Land; and whether any of the same has been since ascertained not to be so: and whether the Surveyor General or any of his deputies, or other Land Officers, became the purchaser of any Land so returned as Swamp Land and was not so’”
which you have referred to this Office, I have the honor to report that some of the public Lands offered for sale at Tallahassee in February last, have been reported in the Surveys as Swamp land; this Office however possesses no evidence that any of the Land thus reported was not Swamp Land.—
The Statement, marked A. shows that at the Sale alluded to there were two tracts of Land bid off, one by a Deputy Surveyor, & the other by a Clerk in the Office of the Surveyor General which tracts appear from the surveys to be low wet, and marshy.—but the Office possesses no evidence that the Land is not as is represented.
At the public Sale alluded to, it does not appear that the Surveyor Gen' made any purchases nor does it appear that the Officers of the Land Office bid off any Lands that the Surveys indicate to be Swamp Land.
I am &c G. G.

<docbody>WILLIAM WIRT. Esq." Baltimore Md SIR. I enclose for y' information and also for your advice a copy of a letter from R. C. Allen Esqr law Agent for Florida,” I had hoped and expected that Gen'Call would in all important cases, have obtained the papers alluded to in the latter part of M*Allen's communication but presume that he has not done so, as the only communication received at this office from him, is that of which a copy has been forwarded to you.
I should think that in all cases where the original documents were deposited and of record in Florida, and where the Spanish Gov" has, contrary to the Treaty, taken them off, that the persons claiming from Spain under that Treaty, thus violated, would be bound, in all cases to produce the original documents in Court before the U. S.
went into trial. Where the original documents were properly of record in Cuba, the reasons urged by the claimants for not producing them may have some force, and it may be necessary for the Gov' of the U.S. to make a demand for such originals. The frauds in relation to these cases are so extensive and so various, that I should think that the Law Agent in Florida should be instructed to require the production of the original papers in every case previous to going into trial, and to obtain a rule of Court to that effect.—
Upon these points we wish y' views & opinions.”

<docbody>HON" JOHN H. EATON Secretary of War.
SIP Col" Richard M. Johnson and Judge Bibb * informed me to day, that in a conversation with you, on the subject of my allowance as Superintendent of Indian affairs, you considered me as having acquiesced in the decession, heretofore made on this subject by the Department. So far from this being the fact I have been protesting against this decission from Spring 1825 * up to this hour, for then it was on a settlement of my accounts for the first time I assertained

$750 was all that would be allowed. A similar allowance had been previously made to Gov” Miller of Arkensas, and mine without any knowledge of the number of Indians in Florida, the expense attending On my Superintendency, was set down at the same It was not untill late in the year 1824 that by the muster rolls that I had taken of the whole number of indians in Florida we assertained that their was upwards of 5,000, The department therefore, fixed the compensation, at the time alluded to, without any knowledge of the number of Indians their dispersed situation, or the expense likely to arrise in a wilderness in a southern country. My allowance was therefore, placed at
$750 per annum only because that was the sum given to Gov Miller—
It is well known that he had very few Indians under his controll, and that the few has since been removed-Gov. Miller resided in fact in New England was seldom in his Territory. he kept no clerk rented no office and incured no expence, that I ever heard of and if he received $750 per annum he was under the circumstances much better paid that I could have been if my allowance had been $1,500 *
Some time in the year 1826 in answer to one of my letters to the Secretary of War on this subject, I was informed my compensation as Supt. would be encreased $100.” I wrote to the Department I
should only be looser in future $50 per annum as the actual expences of my office was only nine hundred Dollars It is not for the first time I now complain. I have & do now insist, that justice has been withheld from me, In a letter to your predecessor, Mr Barbour, I solicited he would apply to Congress to change the law, so as to release the Governor of Florida from the duties of Supt of Indian affairs, giveing to the Agent the entire management of the Indians,” he was authororised to lay my letter before a committee of congress which also contained an offer to have $500 taken from my salary as Governor
(reducing it to $2,000 per annum) if this change could be effected. It will oblige me much if this change can be made, at this, or the next Session of Congress on the same terms—This desire arrises from the fact. in 8 years I have acted as Superintendent of Indian affairs. I
have sunk $4,000, having been compelled to expended $500 per annum in the discharge of my duties & the expences of my office, more than my annual compensation $900 being the actual expences of the office alone The trouble and labour of my duties as Supt have always been greater than my other executive duties—

As to the claim for extra services which the 2" Auditor has reported to you, I never had a doubt. would have been paid had it been presented. during the late administration. The buisness occuring at long intervals. I had determined to complete the same, before I
would ask for compensation, and should have done so, if from some unaccountable cause the buisness had not been transfered a short time before the close of the late administration to Judge Smith of the Eastern district of Florida The first claim can only be refused on the ground, that I took the pittance allowed & which my necessitys, compelled me to receive.
Whither or not, these claims be admitted I am certain of one fact, that if I had never been obliged to act as Supe" I would have saved in
8 years I have been Gover $500 per annum. I am Respectfully Your Obt Sev"

<dochead>THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR DUVAL</dochead>
<source>[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 6]</source>
<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 7th May, 1830.</place-time>
<docbody>To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Govr of Florida & Supt Ind: Affairs &c, SIR, You have presented a claim to this Department, for extra services, upon Indian affairs, from the 10th June, 1822, to the 10th of August 1827, Within this period 257 days are charged for at 8$, a day, making 2,056$; also 771$, for expenses incurred.
The law makes the Governors of Territories, ex-officio Superintendents of Indian Affairs. No compensation is attached. By the Secretary of War however, the sum of 750$, was given to you on account of this service. Subsequently, in 1826, you were allowed the additional sum of 100$,” making the entire allowance to you, as Superintendent, 850$, in all 2,827$.
At the period at which this allowance was made you had been performing the duties which are now charged for, nearly four years. It was proper then, that at that time your claim should have been pre-

sented. On the 20th of April 1824, I find a letter on file in this office, of which the following is an extract. Speaking of the allowance of
750$, which was then made, the Secretary observes, “There is no allowance made by law, for the performance of your duty as Superintendent: but it is made as matter of justice, out of the appropriation on account of Indian Affairs. No allowance of course can be made by the Department, but to cover the expense which may be incidentally incurred in the performance of such duty. If you think the allowance to you, is not sufficient, to cover the expense, the Department has no objection to commute it, for such sum as may be actually expended in the performance of your duty, on a statement being made in the usual form, accompanied by the proper vouchers.”
In the decision here presented, the Secretary proceeded on the ground that 750$, were sufficient. A choice at the same time was presented, to take the sum offered, it being for expenses, or to reject it, and receive the actual expenses which might be incurred; that an authority did not exist, to make an allowance except on the ground, to cover expenses, which might be incidentally incurred. Nothing further appears to have been said until January 1826, when the subject, coming again to the consideration of the Secretary of War, the additional sum of 100$ was allowed, making your compensation 850$, at which it has ever since continued.
The services charged for on account of examining the titles to Negroes, between Indians,—and Whites, and Indians, appear to me, to have been quite a legitimate business as connected with the Superintendence of Indian Affairs. The assignment of this duty subsequently, to Judge Smith, is not a circumstance, whence to conclude that the Department considered it unconnected with the supevision of Indian Affairs. If in the discharge of this duty you were called from home, and subjected to increased expenses, these being shown, might render it proper, on my part, to admit an allowance corresponding to your increased expenditures.
I consider this matter, as having been heretofore arranged, and hence do not feel myself at liberty to disturb the arrangement. Even were my opinion tho’ different, I could not pay you any thing because I have no fund which would be applicable to such a claim.”—
Very Respectfully, JOHN H. EATON.

<place-time>BALTIMORE May 22, 1830</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I think it was one of the instructions in the general letter which I had the honor to address to the Sec: of the Treasury soon after my employment in the land cases in Florida, that the claimants should be required in every case to produce the original documents.” M*
Douglass the district attorney of East Florida, in one of his letters stated that the claimants insisted on the hardship of being required to produce originals—In my answer to him on the 9 July 1829 * I
say “I am still for your demanding the production of all original papers whenever they are accessible. There is reason to beleive that there is fraud in many of these cases, and it cannot be thoroughly ferreted out but by the close and jealous inspection of original papers.
Authenticated copies obliterate those traces of fraud which would stand revealed on the face of the originals. If you are to be direeted checked & restrained in your call for originals let it be by the authority of the Court.”—You perceive, therefore, that I have never had but one opinion on the importance of demanding the production of original papers, and the discoveries bought to light by pursueing this course in Forbes' case, as mentioned by M. Allen,” is a striking illustration of the propriety of this advice. At the same time it cannot be denied that as our government has permitted the Spanish authorities to carry off the original papers in violation of the treaty, there would be great hardship in requiring individuals to compel Spain to surrender

those originals in compliance with the treaty—It is much more proper that the Government which made the treaty should enforce an observance of it, than that individuals who have not the power should be required to do it—If Spain alone was concerned, it would be very proper to say to her we will confirm no titles proceeding from you, unless you produce and deposit the originals in compliance with your treaty—But spain, notwithstanding her profession of solicitude for her subjects, would laugh at such a menace—and give herself no further trouble about it—I think that, in justice to the Claimants as well as to the United States, our government ought to exact a compliance with the treaty and insist on the deposit at New Orleans of all these records which were so improperly carried off—I think that no time should be lost in making the demand and that the respective Courts should be regularly informed by an official circular addressed to the several district attornies, to be laid before their respective Courts, that such a demand has been made and that the Government deems the production of the originals essential to justice, in every case.-I
think that on such a communication the Courts would suspend proceedings until the effect of the demand on Spain should be ascertained.
Perhaps a demand on the Minister of Spain in this Country would produce such an order from him as would induce the Gov' of Cuba to return those papers *—The trial might be made and if he alleges a want of power the demand should be made at Madrid.—This appears to me be the regular course—and perhaps the only course by which the originals could come back with their character of originals—There may be some difficulty in authenticating originals drawn from Cuba on private application. If they come under the sanction & authority of the two Governments there will be no difficulty about it. The subject, I think, is worthy of being brought immediately to the Presidents notice—and of sufficient importance to the Country to call for prompt action from the Department of State—If they think otherwise, the next course is that recommended by M* Allen to send an agent to Cuba, with a written authority to receive from the Governor, there, all the records which according to the treaty ought to have been left at New Orleans—and he might be furnished with a list of all the suits now depending in the several courts of Florida in which the originals are absent—such a specification may enable him to direct his demand with precision, if a general demand should fail.-
Would it not be well for you to lay before the President M* Allen's letter—as well as General Call's—I have a letter from the latter Gentleman under date the 5* april " which I will bring down with

me on monday next—I expect to be in Washington by 2 o'clock of that day—and if you please will wait on the President with you-I
am convinced we have no time to lose, if we mean to baffle these fraudulent demands.-
Yours very respectfully Wm. WIRT-

SIR, Authentic information having reached this Department, that many of the original documents relating to titles to lands in Florida, which ought to have been delivered up at the time of the transfer of that province to the United States, under the Treaty of 1819 with Spain, are now deposited in the different Departments of the Colonial Government of Cuba,” instructions have been given to the Minister of the U.S. at Madrid, to apply to the King of Spain for an order to the Captain General of that Island, to deliver up to the authorised agent of this Government, all such documents, belonging to the Archives of Florida, as may, by any means whatsoever, have found their way into the offices under his jurisdiction.” These instructions have been transmitted by a special messenger, and there is every reason to believe that the application to be made under them will receive the prompt attention of the Spanish Government—
It has been further represented to this Department by the Counsel employed on the part of the U.S. in the trial of several cases, involving important landed interests, that those, and other similar cases now depending in the various Courts in the Territory of Florida, cannot be decided upon principles of justice and existing law, without the production of the original documents above referred to.—Under these circumstances, the President has directed me to instruct the Attornies of the U. S. for all the Districts within which, such cases may be pending, to state to the Courts the facts above mentioned, and to move a suspension of all those trials wherein the original documents cannot be produced, until the result of the application directed to be made to the Spanish Goverment, shall have been made known to them thro' this Department.—You will accordingly conform to these directions, in all the cases brought before the Courts within your District, involving the titles to lands under grants from the Spanish Colonial Authorities.”—

<docbody>SIR I have the Honour to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the
25" May,” Inclosing a Copy of a Letter to you, from M* Wirt, dated
22nd May."—
I am gratified to learn, that the Subject of my Letter of 23"April "
is deemed by him of sufficient Importance to the Country, to require the prompt action of the Government upon it, and I feel anxious to learn the Determination of the President in regard to the Suggestions contained in M* Wirts Letter.—
The Original Papers have been demanded of the Claimants in all Cases, where they were not in the first Instance produced and filed, but the Claimants reply to this Demand, by alledging, that the Originals are not in eur their possession or power; that they were removed by the Spanish authorities to Havana, where they still are; that it is in the power of the Government alone, to Demand and obtain them, and that so long as Spain is permitted, by the Government of the United States to retain the custody of papers which properly belong to the United States under the Treaty, without an Effort to procure

their return, the United States virtually acknowledge, that the Detention of Spain those Documents by Spain is rightful; and that of consequence certified Copies must be received in Evidence.
I confess, that it appears to me very Difficult successfully to reply to this argument, and my Opinion has been that the Courts would sustain it, and permit Copies to be read in testimony. Entertaining this Opinion, I thought it my Duty to present it to the Consideration of the President and to suggest the necessity of the immediate action of the Government for its own protection and Defence, against Demands on Her Domain of more than a million of acres in Amount, which there are many reasons to believe are fraudulent.
The proper mode to effect the Object, I have no Doubt, is that suggested by M. Wirt, and that the Demand should be made upon the Sovereign of Spain at Madrid, but I would respectfully suggest, whether the Services of an Agent in Directing the search among old papers. for such as may be interresting, on the trial of these Cases, and in receiving such as may be found, will not be indispensible to the success of the project.—It is a fact which will not be denied, that those Claimants most deeply interrested, reside at Havanna, or have friends and relatives there, who will be able to thwart the Views of the Government, unless she is represented by an active and intelligent Agent, on the Spot, who if he is well informed of the Character of the papers of most Importance to the Government, would be able to counteract, in a great Degree, the Influence of the Claimants, and others upon the under officers and secretaries of the Government of Cuba.”

SIR, Your letter advising me of your return from Cuba,” was duly rec'd, and submitted to the President as soon as I could obtain an interview with him. After perusing the letter he remarked that the Secretary of State had received a communication from you on the

Subject of your mission. to Cuba,” which would be attended to &
requested that I would forward your letter to me, immediately to M*
Wirt. Your letter was therefore forwarded to M'. Wirt, & one of the Gent" in the Office was requested, to acknowledge the receipt of y"
letter and advise you of its disposition. This I thought had been done but it seems that it was omitted. A Communication has been rec" from M* Allen recommending that another special Agent should be sent to Cuba for the purpose of obtaining original papers.” This letter was also by the direction of the President, submitted to M*
Wirt, and a copy of his answer forwarded to M*Allen.” Hearing that M. Wirt was in the City, about the period of the adjournment of Congress, I sent him word, that if he would call upon me I would go with him to the Presidents for the purpose of having a interview on the subject of these claims generally. He did call, but finding that I was unable to attend him, he took the papers and said he would himself see the President. I subsequently understood from the President, that he had requested M. Wirt to call at the State Dept: & ascertain what measures had been taken as well for the obtaining the original papers relative to private claims, as the certified copies of the royal orders. and correspondence of the Spanish Gov' required by the Supreme Court previous to giving an opinion in cases that have been argued before it. Not seeing M* Wirt afterwards and having ever since been confined to my room by indisposition I do not know what specific measures have been taken on the subject, farther than that a special messenger has been sent to carry the instructions to our Minister at the Court of Spain,”—I will thank you to show this letter to M*Allen.

<docbody>D* SIR In reply to your note of yesterday," informing me that you had been charged, last winter in Washington with holding and expressing opinions here adverse to those generally held in this Country on the subject of Slavery; that you were opposed to our public Works and fortifications, and had Spoken disparagingly of the

people; and asking me to give my testimony in relation to the truth of those charges. I can answer only in the negative.
Before your arival in this Territory, there was some expression of feeling against you, on account of the appointment of Secretary, having been given to a nonresident. it could not have been personal, because I believe you were an intire stranger to the people. I became acquainted with you immediately on your arival among us, and being a member of the Legislative Council was frequently in your Company last fall, and our friendly intercourse has continued. I
have never at any time heard you make a remark, that could Justify in the Slightest degree either of those charges, nor have I heard any other person so charge you. I think your deportment since you have been in Florida ought to Contridict the last charge; as, I believe it has had the effect of removing the prejudices which were entertained towards you, before you were known "

<docbody>ROBERT BUTLER, Esq S G. Tallahassee. F.
SIR, I enclose you a printed copy of an Act to provide for the final settlement of the Land claims in Florida,” together with a printed copy of the Report of the Reg. & Recr.”—
7" Other recommendations on behalf of Westcott written during 1830 are in NA (SD, Applications) and were received from the following persons: R. C.
Allen, Abraham Bellamy, Turbutt R. Betton, Robert Beveridge, John P. Booth, Thomas M. Bradford, Robert Butler, R. K. Call, J. W. Campbell, James Dell, James A. Dunlap, I. W. Exum, Davis Floyd, John Y. Garey, P. W. Gautier, Jr., A. Mandell, Isaac W. Mitchell, Joseph S. Sanchez, I. G. Searcy, Charles E.
Sherman, L. M. Stone and Charles Howard, and Benjamin D. Wright. See also post, pp. 431, 435.

Altho' further time has been given by the Act for deciding upon a portion of these claims, yet I do not think that this ought to prevent Our commencing the surveys in East Florida in the month of November next.—
Your surveys should commence by subdividing those Townships which have been already run out South of the St. Marys and East of the Suwannee and including Amelia, and the other Islands along the Coast. The instructions heretofore given to you respecting the surveying of the public Lands and private claims are so particular that nothing farther suggests itself to me on those points, at present, except to call your attention to the animadversions of the Reg & Rec' in their report on the surveys made by M Clarke,” which correspond with the views of this Office as heretofore communicated to you; and the surveys of M* Clarke cannot be considered as valid except where they may be established by their intrinsic calls, or where they may stand the test of blocking-out, as heretofore suggested to you. I
would also suggest the necessity of your requiring the Deputies to be particularly accurate in connecting their surveys on the large Water courses, so that those Water courses may be correctly exhibited on our Maps. I am aware that the St Johns River will present much difficulty in this respect, but it is indispensably necessary that we should be enabled to lay it down accurately from the returns of the Surveyors.
With respect to the claims for which Royal titles were obtained subsequent to the 24th of January 1818, & which have to be reported by the Reg & Rec" to the next Session of Congress. I think it advisable as some of these claims may be confirmed hereafter, that altho’
the lines of the public Surveys will have to run through them, yet that the lines of the claims themselves should also be run out & so connected with the public lines as to enable you, in the event of the confirmation of any one of them, to have it accurately laid down on the plat, and the contents of the adjacent fractions correctly known without being at the trouble and expense of sending a Deputy to make a survey of that particular claim.
The extent of the private claims, and the inherent difficulties incident to the surveying of them, and the extent of the discretionary powers, necessarily vested in the Deputies, imposes upon you the responsibility of employing only such Deputies as possess a thorough knowledge of their business, and whose integrity and honesty are unquestionable. It is, however, desireable that as many Deputies of this description as can be procured should be employed and the surveying not confined to a very few individuals.

You will observe that the 7th & 8th Sections have changed the law relative to the location and selection of some of the private claims heretofore surveyed, and to which sections I beg leave to call your attention. Altho' I regret this change in the law, it will in some measure facilitate the surveys and selections to be made and will enable you to Survey the Islands covered by private claims without difficulty.
x * The claimant of the Island of Key West *has been exceedingly anxious to have that Island surveyed, and as the present law removes all difficulty on the subject, I have to request that you will have it surveyed as soon as practicable. With respect to the Islands on the Eastern Coast of Florida, I presume that there will be little difficulty in connecting them with the Township & in giving the surveys their sectional numbers, but it is apprehended that this will not be the case in relation to Key West, and those Islands and Keys which extend South West from the point of Florida. In relation to them your Surveyors must exercise a sound discretion; they should however be so particularized and designated on a connected plat as to enable us to patent them with facility and certainty—the bearings and distances of one Island from the others should be particularly stated *

<docbody>SIR I now enclose you my accounts as finally closed in the case of the contract with M Kingsley for the improvement of the inland navigation between the St Marys & S" Johns river—
The report of Gen" Bernard on the estimate made, contemplated the removal of certain obstructions enumerated so as to admit the free passage of small boats at any stage of the tide *—In a former letter " I stated that the channel or creek, at the Amelia Narrows was so intricate and crooked that I thought no improvement within the amount awarded could essentially benefit the navigation and I

therefore recommended as a substitute the cutting of a canal from a deep creek flowing into Belle river to the waters of Nassau—This cut or canal without the clearing out of the creek which unites it with Nassau river, has been completed so as to admit of the passage of Wessels at high tides drawing not more than 5% to 6 feet water—When I last inspected it there was 7 feet water in the canal—on examining the marsh on the commencement of operations, a semi liquid was encountered at a foot or two above the level of low tide, & apprehensions were at first entertained of the impracticability of penetrating below it—Every effort to do so endangered the banks; the Canal was therefore excavated to that level the last Summer & left for the currents of the flood & ebb tides to act on it—As was conjectured, these proved beneficial, & on resuming the work this spring we were enabled to complete the cut & creek to the depth mentioned above—Still apprehending some further injury from the currents I have under bond obligated Mr Kingsley to clean out the creek & canal this fall & make any reperations to the banks which may be necessary—
This became the more important as the current in the Canal at flood tide is much more rapid than I had anticipated and has occasioned a regret on my part, that I had not given a greater width to the canal at first-
I am still however inclined to the opinion (which has derived much strength from the experience of the last year) that the current will ultimately perform the work we wish, more effectually than the labor of man, provided on every encroachment on the banks the mud caving in be removed from the bottom of the canal—The slope to the sides will then be more regular & permanent as it will receive the inclination the soil is best capable of sustaining and which is among the most serious defficulties encountered in working in every irregular mixtures of sand, mud & marine shells—
The Talbot dividings have been left as they were found. some excavations made through the bars formed across the channel satisfied me that no work at that point could be permanent without an entire removal of the whole bank stretching across the pass and to some distance from the place—The bank consists of sand & mud & refils any excavation made upon each succeeding tide—I therefore deducted from the Contract the amt of work that was to have been performed at that place At the Sisters a channel has been cut through the Oyster bank, so as to admit of the depth & width contemplated—To shorten the distance a cut was made last fall in a straight direction, but this not according with the current it refilled In the new cut advantage has been taken of the tides & will I trust prove permanent—The Con-

tractor however is obligated in this case, as at the Amelia cut, to remove any injury sustained between this & the succeeding fall-
The navigation between the S" Marys & St Johns rivers, may now be considered open at high tide for any of the Coasting schooners drawing not more than 5% to 6 feet water and boats may pass the Amelia cut & Sisters, the extremities of the passage at so early a stage of the flood as generally to be at the Talbot dividings at the favourable stage of the waters half or full tide, so as not to be impeded by that obstruction—
This navigation however, as connected with the proposed canal across the Penensula of Florida, may be deemed sufficiently important to be improved, so as to admit of the free passage of Coasting Schooners & Steam boats at any stage of the tides—I have therefore thought it would be acceptable (& shall so soon as I can obtain certain data on which to form an estimate) forward you a plan for its improvement at the least cost *

<docbody>SIR I have received your note of this morning" and can have no hesitation in complying with your request.
The course pursued by me, last Winter, at Washington in regard to your appointment, was not of a personal Character towards yourself, or dictated by personal considerations on my part. I considered it my duty to the people I represented, to remonstrate against the appointment of non resident strangers to the Offices in this Territory.—In doing this, I only advanced opinions, always entertained
& acted upon by me under the preceding as well as the present administration.

Shortly after my arrival in Washington, I addressed a Letter to the Sect of State upon the Subject of the appointments emanating from that Department, that had been made in Florida.”—It contained an explanation of my general views, on Grounds of public expediency and policy, but your name was not mentioned.—After your nomination to the Senate, I addressed a communication to that Body in which I protested against the Confirmation of several appointments, and among them yours."—The Objections urged by me were entirely general, and were made as expressing the sentiments of those I
represented.
There were no accusations or objections of a personal Character, or anything derogatory to your reputation, or calculated to wound your feelings, or those of your friends, made by me in that Communication, or otherwise—I had no motive to assail you personally, as you had never offered me offence or Injury.
While I shall always endeavour to do my duty to my constituents faithfully and firmly, without regard to Consequences to myself, I
shall never avail myself of my Situation as Delegate, to inflict wanton injury on the feelings & character of any one.
There were representations by Letters, & otherwise, made to me while at Washington, of your Course here, calculated to induce earnest and strenuous opposition, on my part, to your nomination, & its confirmation, (with which I have no repugnance, fully to acquaint you, as you request) but before I would have urged these against you, I would first have given you notice of them.—To Senators with whom I conversed on the Subject, I so expressed myself.
About the time of the approval of your nomination, I received Letters from several of my friends in Florida, which spoke of you in different terms from the representations alluded to; & from which, I
state with great satisfaction, I inferred that many persons had done you Injustice, (doubtless through misconception and misinformation)
& had I pursued a different course than the one I have stated, I
should regret it.
Misrepresentations have, I expect been made to you and to others, of my course towards you, as are made of most other of my acts, by some who find pleasure, and conceive they see their Interest in so doing, but I do not doubt, that upon looking at my Correspondence on the Subject, which I will cheerfully submit to your inspection, and upon seeking for correct information from better sources, you will be entirely satisfied you have no right to complain of it.
I feel myself bound to ask of you the names of any who may have

made representations with regard to myself, contrary to what I have stated above, as that will be a matter of adjustment between them &
me."

SIR, I have this day required for you the sum of two Thousand dollars being the amount of an appropriation made at the last Session of Congress to compleat the repair of the road from Alaqua to Mariana in Florida *—You will visit that part of the country and take measures to have the repairs made. An inspection of the repairs made last year by Captain Burch, on the Tallahassee Road will give you a better idea of the manner of repairing the section confided to your superintendence than any written instructions which I could give you at this distance-I rely on your judgement to apply the appropriation to the best advantage—
Pine poles must not be used in constructing bridges as they are of such a nature, as by rotting to be rendered good for nothing in a short time—Juniper, light wood and heart of pine, are the only materials that are to be used for any bridges that may be erected on the route.
Hands, I am told, may be employed on better terms in the vicinity of the road than elsewhere—
Judge Breckenridge, who resides near the road, and is well acquainted with the Country, can give much useful information and advice in regard the work—I will thank you to see and consult him;
and should you find it necessary to appoint an Agent to act in your absence, he would be a suitable person; and he has proffered his services in any way that he can be useful."

I wish the work to be commenced as soon as practicable, and prosecuted with the utmost energy.—

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE 3"August 1830</place-time>
<docbody>MY DEAR SIR I have the satisfaction to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7" Ult" enclosing me a certificate of deposit in the Branch Bank of the United States at Washington for $774.20,

with deeds to Mess" Doyle * and Carruthers for the lands purchased by them from Gen' Lafayette.
With regard to your inquiry whether a company can be formed at Tallahassee to purchase from ten to fifteen Sections of Gen Lafayettes land on either the East or North of the Township, I cannot at this moment give a satisfactory reply, I will therefore make the necessary inquiry and will write you again on the subject.
To your 2" inquiry I must reply that I do not believe that a sale of that number of Sections could be promptly made to individuals, at good prices though I am of opinion that such a sale might be made during the winter.
I do not conceive it would be adviseable te at the next land Sales to offer the land of Gen' Lafayette as the time would be too short to give the necessary notice to those who might wish to purchase. If a company should not be formed which will purch the quantity proposed, I think by giving five or six months notice, of a sale at auction that these lands might be sold to considerable advantage. Many of the tracts are of the most superior quality, and are well worth the price you mention. By selling for one forth cash and the balance in four anual instalments, I think they would bring their value. In the mean time if you are disposed to make the experiment of selling at private sale, if you will give me the necessary instructions I will advertise them and I have no doubt that some sales would be made in a very short time, and perhaps by the expiration of the Six months as much might be disposed of as you wish to sell at present. These lands have not yet attained their value, and perhaps they may not for several years, owing to the great quantity of wild lands in the country. Every experiment in agriculture however is attended with favourable results, and I see nothing to prevent them from becoming very valuable in a few years. The lands in the neighbourhood of Tallahassee are improving in reputation every year as they improve in product. No doubt is entertained of their capasity to produce sugar crops to great advantage, but the value and quantity of cotton produced to the acre, renders it very doubtful whe [MS. torn] the latter is not the best staple, as it [MS. torn] which may be prepared for market with [MS. torn] little expense. On our best lands the Planter may calculate with great confidence on making even at the present low price of Cotton from two to three hundred dollars per hand. This

is better than the average Sugar crops of Louisiana or even of the Island of Cuba.”
I regret exceedingly to hear of your continued bad health, but hope sincerely that it will soon be restored.
Very respectfully Your ob" St R. K. CALL

To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P.

The Commanding Officer will, agreeably to your request, be instructed to give the Indian agent on his written application, such aid as may be necessary to enable him to execute the duties required of him.—

<docbody>SIR I have now the honour to Report the progress of the work under my charge (the removal of obstructions in the river and harbour of St Marks) for the month ending the 31st day of Augst."
The opperations which on account of the sickness in the force employd, had been suspended on the 10th July were resumed on the 10th of August and confined to that part of the work which had been left unfinish" between this place and the “Little rapids”
All the trees in this section overhanging the river or standing on its banks, so as to impede the free passing of vessels by entangling their yards and masts have been removed The removal of the logs already fallen into the river has been more tedious than was expected and consiquently has taken more time than was intimated in my last report, nevertheless this section will in two or three more days be finish"
It is my purpose then to remove the force to the mouth of the river and ascend regularly removeing such difficulties as immediately retards navigation. They do not compare, with the work already done on account of the increased width of the river, nor do I think they will occupy more time than what was spent in the first section The work goes on regularly and with a strict eye to economy in which I am much aided by the contract with Ma” Chaires for the supply of the requisit hands.” There is less sickness amongst them

besides which they are more regular and under better decipline than those heretofore employed. They are under the management of two competant and industrious overseers besides which Ma" Chaires has furnish" according to our understanding two valuable drivers.
This arrangement allows them to be work" in seperate gangs and each under good management.

SIR, In compliance with your letter of the 12" ult.” directing me to report to you on the 15* Sep" the progress made up to that day, on all the works under my direction, have the honor to submit the following Statement viz:
1* The repairs of the road from St: Augustine to Tallahassee.
The repairs of the road have been completed to within fifteen miles of Tallahassee, with the exception of that portion of it, which lies between St. John's River and Alachua Court house, which I was directed not to repair in your letter of the 22" of January.”
On my last visit to the party engaged on the road, I calculated that it would be completed by the 15" of August, and fearing that the appropriation might be exceeded, I directed the party to be discharged on that day, -however on the Settlement of the claims, I find that there are yet $396=42/100 remaining unexpended, which will be sufficient to complete the road, and will be applied to that purpose without daily.”—
2" The continuation of the old Kings Road to New Smyrna.
This road was commenced by me from the Tomoka River, and has

been completed three miles south of Spruce Creek a distance of twenty miles.—
The slow progress which has been made on this road is atributable to the distance, and difficulty, of transportation of every article of subsistence, and material—the construction of many Bridges and causeways, through low grounds.—In consequence of the unhealthiness of the country, and almost incredible annoyance to the horses by flies, I have discharged the party at work on the road, until the return of the healthy season, which will be about the 1* of November.
The person whom I employed to superintend, and twe three of the carpenters employed in constructing a bridge over Spruce creek, have returned to St: Augustine with a very severe fever, and the principal owner of the slaves was unwilling to continue them at this season of the year.—
I have now remaining nine hundred and ninety one dollars, and about five hundred dollars in property from the appropiation applicable to the road which will be sufficient to complete it to New Smyrna, as the most difficult part is already finished. The whole will be completed about the 15" of December.
3"—The Bridge and causeway are both completed—the latter has sustained material injury by the late storm, but from the remittance of $5369. and */100 there is a balance remaining of $520=*/100 which will be sufficient to put it in good order.
I enclose a statement of expences incurred in constructing the bridge and causeway, as there appears to be some difference in my statement, and the Official statements forwarded to me from your office arising thus—
Official statement of my accounts for the 4* Quarter 1829 no mention is made of extra duty men for November and December.
Extra service in November amounted to $10:*%00—in December to
$22:”%00—amount expended for the month of January agrees with my statement viz: $24:”%00.
Official statement during the month of February $15:18%/100
should be $21=1%00.

Davis Floyd to Robert Butler
7th September 1830.
DEAR SIR Having understood that the present owners of the Island of Key West have made application to the proper department to have that island surveyed for the purpose no doubt of obtaining a patent for the land I feel it my duty as one of the administrators of John B. Strong deceased to state, that Strongs heirs have a mortgage

on that property, from George Murray who sold to them, and in whose name, if I am not mistaken the claim was recommended for confirmation. There are two questions connected with the case in which Strongs heirs are interested. first could the present owners without the consent of the Mortgagees take the quantity of one league square, and secondly would the patent to them direct, effect their interest.
The mortgages are in my possession and are recorded both at St Augustine, and in the County Court at Key West. Strongs heirs live in Connecticut and New York and most of them are minors I
presume that before the patents issue that the Department will see that no third party is to be injured by it. I think that you will find that the claim as brought before the Commissioners was for a larger quantity than a league (square) and was in the name of George Murray.

<docbody>SIR I have now the honour to report the progress of the work under my charge (the removal of obstructions in the river and harbour of St Marks) for the month ending 30th Sept.
After the completion of the section between the “little rapids” and this place the whole force was removed to the mouth of the river where they opperated in two gangs (one on each side) removeing such trees as overhung and such as had fallen into it That section between the mouth and the rapids about seven miles in distance has been so far completed as to permit the force to be employd above on the section between this and Rock Haven or the head of the river.
In this section it will be my purpose only to remove such difficulties as can be done at little expense improveing the river for scow navigation. The improvements below is all that I consider it Judicious or fair to undertake (viewing the amt appropriated) until the work in the harbour shall have been commenced and so far prosecuted or completed as to warrant the belief that a sum of the appropriation may be left which will Justify an attempt to make some improvement at the rapids by deepening the channel.
I consider it also my duty to report an inaccuracy in the Survey and report of Colo Macomb which if not understood by the Eng"

Depart- might create the question why the improvements as they have been and are still makeing in the St Marks river He states in the report of his survey that the river is 100 yards wide with occasional Variations from the head to its Junction with the Wacully. If this had been the case there would have been no cause for the expenditure that has taken place in its improvement. But in no place within the space mentioned does the width exceed 50 yards and generally less than 35 yds. It is however not common to find so exceedingly narrow a river to afford as great a depth of water except at the rapids averageing 13 feet from Magnolia to St. Marks.
I would further suggest the propriety of forwarding with all possible despatch the Machine for the opperations in the Harbour.

Which includes the distance form Alagua to oak hill within sixteen miles of Mariana, from oak hill to Mariana, there is no direct road, the one now used is about four miles out of the way, in consiquence of Which I was requested by several persons in Mariana, not to expend any Money on the old rout, they at the same time informed me that commissioners had been appointed at the last Session of their Court to run and cut out a road on a direct line from that to oak hill and Which would be immediately carried into execution. and they would be glad any money that might be expended would be put on the new road, Which together with the fact of the old route being a very bad one, induced me to defer the repairs on that part of the route until the new road is cut out The road as far as oak hill will be completed on or before the 15"

<docbody>ROBERT BUTLER, Esq S Gen.' Tallahassee. F.
SIR, In reply to your letter of the 21st Ulto.” I have to inform you that there are $8000 remaining of the appropriation for the survey of private Land claims of which such portion may be applied to the survey of those claims as will fall within the limits of the townships to be surveyed this winter, and the ensuing spring.
As to the funds that can be appropriated for the surveying of the public Lands in Florida during the present year, I do not believe that of the remaining balance of the general fund (there having been no appropriation for surveys made by Congress at the last Session) more than $10.000 can be spared for your Department. This fact however need not interfere with your surveying operations, inasmuch as the appropriation for the year 1831. will have been made before the surveys will be returned to your Office.
You will therefore proceed to act agreeably to the instructions of my predecessor in his letter bearing date 10th July 1830.”
I would call your special attention to the imperious necessity of urging on your Deputies the observance of every possible accuracy and care in every branch of their duty. The difficulties and embarrassments resulting from the want of skill or inattention in the making of a survey, cause endless trouble to your Office and to the Department.
I would therefore take occasion to refer you to the letter of my predecessor of 10th July last, and to state in addition thereto that your Deputy Surveyors should be made expressly to understand that whenever the private claims cannot be made to protract from the courses and distances exhibited in the field notes, and whenever they are found not to connect with the public land, in the same or the adjoining township, it is prima-facie evidence that error exists in the field, which error must necessarily be corrected at the expense of the Dep’ Surveyor.
As a further means of obviating errors I would suggest the recurrence to the standard chain, and comparison therewith of the chains used by the Deputies as often as practicable, and always before entering on the survey under a new Contract.
It is expected at this Office that the township plats will indicate

both by letters and by distinctive colors all swamps and ponds, and the extent of them, and also indicate the existence of every natural object which may either tend to gratify the curiosity of the public or to afford useful official information as to the topography of the country.
With these views I would request that your instructions to your
\Deputies may be drawn up with special minuteness.
In cases where the Surveyors meet with Townships which by reason of sterility are not worth subdividing, the exterior township lines only are to be run, with the view to maintain the connexion of the public surveys, and in all cases where a part only of a Township can be surveyed, the cause or causes which rendered it inexpedient or impracticable to survey the residue are to be particularly indicated on the township plat—and any Deputy Surveyor who shall be found to omit completing the survey of a township, from no other cause than that it did not meet his convenience so to do should not hereafter be employed.
You state the necessity of your being furnished with ten or twelve copies of the Reports on Florida land claims for the use of your Deputies, a copy of each report has heretofore been transmitted to your Office, and there remain no copies at the disposal of this Office.
As the claims are to be surveyed by law on the evidence to be furnished by the Keeper of the Archives, it is not believed that the Reports if in their possession would furnish any facilities to the Deputies in the execution of their duties.

SIR, The instructions heretofore given in relation to the survey of the Island of Key West *may be executed, as soon as circumstances will admit.
There is nothing in the law which need delay or prevent the execution of that survey, and as neither the interest of individuals nor that of the Gov" can be affected injuriously by the fact of the survey being made, I would call your early attention to the subject.—
The Island is merely to be meandered along its Coast with the

view to ascertain its true contents. The discrimination between the portion thereof that will remain to the public and the portion that will accrue to the claimant under the law, will not be ascertained until the provisions of the law requiring a relinquishment of title to the U.S. of all the quantity claimed over one league square, shall have been duly complied with.
If the Island should have a bluff—Coast the survey will be simple
& easy. If parts of it, however, should more or less be affected by the tides, the survey is to be ordered as to exhibit the area at ordinary low tides; and it is further desired that you will report as nearly as can be estimated, the difference between the area of the Island at ordinary low, & ordinary high tide, and indicate the same by some particular colour on the plat of survey.—
You will be advised in a few days respecting other subjects connected with your letter of the 21st Ulto.”

SIR, In pursuance of advices from the Sec of the Treasury,” issued on the recommendation of the Navy Department, I have to request that you will be pleased to instruct your Deputy Surveyors to notice in their progress those tracts of the public lands which produce live Oak or other timber valuable for naval purposes in the vicinity of navigable Streams.
The live oak of all sizes is the principal object to which it is desired to direct their attention. The long leaf yellow pine and Palmetto, where they are found in sufficient quantities being also said to be valuable for the purposes of the Navy Dept, it is also required and expected that the surveyors will notice them.—
As it is not contemplated by the Dep" to make any reservations of timber lands at a greater distance than three miles back from raft navigation, the observations of the Surveyors need not extend beyond that distance.—
The surveyors are expected to make such observations in their field notes in relation to the extent and abundance of the several kinds of timber referred to, as will enable you with accuracy to exhibit such lands on your township plats with a view to their future reservation for sale. A discriminating colour should therefore be used for all Lands proposed to be reserved for the purposes of the Navy Dept."

<docbody>To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida, SIR, Your letters to the Secretary of War of the 11th * and 18th Ultimo,” are received.
In reply to your suggestion for the appointment of a special agent, I am directed to inform you that it is the duty of the Indian agent, under your directions, to attend to claims for slaves, both, of the Indians and white people, and all other claims growing out of their intercourse with each other, and to collect and report all such information and evidence in relation to the same as may be necessary to a correct decision, and that no special agent can therefore be appointed for that purpose.
As to withholding the annuity as a mean of compelling the delivery of negroes by the Indians, I am directed to say, that it is doubted, whether there is any authority to touch the annuity of the Indians, except for claims allowed under the act of intercourse of 1802,” and that as the claims for slaves are not considered as embraced by that act, it would be improper to withhold the annuity for any purpose connected with them—especially when the title is still in dispute between the Indians and the claimants. It is believed that in most of the cases, the slaves claimed are of the description referr'd to in the 7" article of the treaty with the Florida Indians "–and that if the claimants will authorize the agent to offer the Indians a reasonable compensation for apprehending and delivering them, as provided for by said article, there is little doubt it would lead to the recovery of the negroes in many instances, where other means have failed.
This being the course pointed out by the treaty, the Secretary directs that it be pursued."—

<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, F.
SIR, Your letter to the Secretary of War of the 2nd Inst" advising of your bill for 1000$, on account of the school fund provided for by the treaty with the Florida Indians, has been received.
I am directed by the Secretary of War to state, that as the treaty with the Florida Indians stipulates for a school at the agency, the expenditure of the money for the education of boys in Kentucky, (where the expenses will of course be greatly increased and beyond what the fund may be adequate to meet) would not be a proper fulfilment of the treaty stipulation, and might therefore occasion

dissatisfaction among the Indians—To avoid any difficulty on the subject, he will, for the reasons above stated, be under the necessity of refusing his acceptance to your bill, if presented for payment.”—

<docbody>SIR I have been honored by your commands of the 15"Ultimo” and here with transmit a return of land Suits which were instituted against the United States in this district under the act of Congress of 23"
May 1828" and made returnable to may term 1829 also a return of Such land Suits as were instituted under that act & made returnable to November term 1829" (all of these Suits were instituted before the 24" May 1829 except one which was on my motion dismissed for having been commenced too late) I also transmit a return of the Suits instituted against the United States under this act which were pending in this court at its last May term and another for Such of said Suits as were pending & decided at the last November term there of which has just closed also a return embracing a Suit which was instituted against the United States under the act of Congress of 26"

May 1830 * and made returnable at november term 1830 in each of these Suits an answer has been filed in a large portion of them more or less testimony has been taken Several of them have been argued
& Submitted, one of the most important of them has just been decided against the United States" and I Shall in a few days forward you a transcript of the record accompanied by a report of the argument of the cause in this Court noting the points made and authorities referred to by the respective Counsel, I also transmit two returns for our last May term one for Suits on Treasury transcripts & one for Suits on Custom House bonds and and for five forfeitures & penalties decided
& pending in this court at Said term and two Similar returns for the late November term the five returns first above mentioned exhibit the state of all the Suits instituted against the United States in this district on land claims and the four last are the suits pending and decided in this Court at the terms therein respectively mentioned in which the United States are plaintiffs in addition to these there is one Suit pending in this Court at Jacksonville in Duval County which is connected with the Post office & I have forwarded a return for that to the Clerk there for his certificate with directions for him to enclose it to you.—
The mail of last evening brought me your circular of the first instant * and I also herewith send the return there in requested all of which I hope will be satisfactory. It may perhaps be proper for me to observe that our court holds three Sessions annually for chancery business commencing on the first monday in March and October &
the second monday in July but that as all the land Suits as well as the case of the Heirs of Mifflin & Merrick which are the only chancery suits on our docket in which the United States are interested were made returnable either at the May or November terms, they being the terms prescribed by act of Congress, at which both law and equity business is done & as no decision has taken place in any of the cases at any of the other Sessions I I have not deemed it necessary to make any return for them, nor have I considered those sessions as embraced by the law requiring me to make a return after every term, I call your attention to this matter that you may signify your pleasure in relation to it which will be a law to me upon the subject. I am in favour of a strict accountability of public officers and highly approve of the measures adopted by yourself and other members of this administration with a view to produce that effect & will give it my hearty cooperation so far as anything may be desired of me—notwithstanding

my Warious engagements press at this time very heavily upon me, our court besides the two terms & three annual Sessions above mentioned hold two terms at Jacksonville 40 Miles from this city & two terms at Alachua more than 100 miles distant annually & I am required to attend to all the criminal business of the Territory as well as to all the Suits in which the United States are parties of which you will perceive that we have now upwards of 60. I hope therefore that if any thing which I ought to have done has been neglected it will be ascribed rather to a press of business than any wilful omission. I
however beg leave to mention that my return for the last may term which I suppose is the one you allude to in your communication of the
15" Ult” as not having been made was inclosed to Stephen Pleasanton Esq" but as the receipt of it was not acknowledged I presume it never came to hand. please have the goodness to acknowledge the receipt of this & the accompanying documents & believe me to be Sir your Obt Serv't THO DOUGLAS

SIR, In reply to your remarks referring the enclosed communication to this office,” I have the honor to report that we have no means of ascertaining whether or not the parties signing the paper are entitled to preEmption rights, under either of the Acts referred to.—
It appears, however, that the Lands to which they allude yet remain to be surveyed, and in connection with the surveying of which, is the subject of extending the surveys along a considerable line of the Coast between St Rosa and the Apilachicola Bays, along which it is probable there are other individuals who may assert claims under the preFmption Law of 1830." The reasons why those surveys have not yet been made can probably be explained by Col" Butler, and as the only means that the Department can adopt towards accomplishing the wishes of the parties interested, I intend making a communication to Col° Butler on the subject of surveying in that quarter of his Surveying Department.”
The individuals signing the paper are in error if they suppose that they have a right to cut down Timber from public Lands before those Lands are surveyed and sold to them either as Pre Emption rights or other wise.
I am &c.

<docbody>SIR I have now the honour to report the progress of the operations of removing obstructions in the River and harbour of St. Marks for the Month ending the 30th day of November 1830. All the obstructions (“artificial,,) in the river from its source to its mouth have been removed with the exception of some grass growing on the rocks in the bed of the river at the “Little rapids, and which I purpose to remove in two or three days. The other difficulties at this point being a ledge

of rocks extending across and a distanct of 100 yards up and down the river is a subject which I yet retain for further examination and report.
This being a “natural, obstruction and in the bed of the river I do not consider it proper to molest it until an improvement is made in the channel at the “Devils Elbow” and “Middle ground”, besides which it is my opinion in which I am seconded by men of experience and Judg” that to attempt to depen the channel at the rapids by blasting or otherwise removeing the Rock would exaust more of the apropriation than it would be Judicious or fair to apply to that object.
It is my impression however that a considerable aditional depth of water could be had at this point by a Lock built at the foot of the fall which (as the materials are at hand) could be accomplishd for a moderate sum, The fall is considerable, a current constantly setting down, although the tide rises and falls in it 2 feet 4 inches. The width of the river at this point is about thirty yards and would require if lock" an enbankment on each side 3 feet in height and a distance of 150 yards in extent The depth of the River from its mouth to this place is not less and generally upwards of 10 feet at low water except at the two points call" the “long” and “Little Rapids” on the first of which there is only 7 feet 2 Inches and a tide rising 2 feet 10 Inches, at the other 4 feet 7 Inches and a tide of 2 feet 4 Inches, No improvement therefore can be desireable if even practicable at the first place but I think the lock will create 3 feet more water at the second place and of course would add greatly to the convenience of commerce. I
may be premature in those suggestions will therefore make an estimate of the cost of the work I mention and submit it with my opinion finally on that point, The hands employd I have discharged with the exception of a few who are engaged in cuting wood for the Machine to be used in the harbour which I find more economical than paying the price p" cord demanded for it.”

<docbody>SIR, Enclosed is a copy of a communication from Rufus Sewall and others of Florida,” complaining that they are not able to avail themselves of the pre-emption laws in consequence of the land on which they reside not having been surveyed. The writers falsely suppose that they have a right to cut down timber from the public land before the same has been actually disposed of to them.
This communication has brought into view the necessity of completing the surveys along the whole line of coast between Apalachicola and St. Rosa bays for the purpose of enabling the Government to dispose of such portions of the land as it may not be expedient to reserve for Naval purposes, as the live oak & other timber valuable for the Navy abound in that region.
In order to enable the Government to make the most judicious reservations, you are requested to instruct your Surveyors to make the most particular observations they can, to admit of the indication on the township plats of the tracts to be reserved in the mode pointed out in my letter of the 8" ultimo. The enclosed diagram will serve to point out the line of coast referred to—the pencilling indicates the portion thereof remaining to be surveyed.
I will thank you for an immediate reply thereto.”

<docbody>DEAR SIR. I expected to have sailed for Florida four or five weeks since, but have been detained by the illness of my youngest daughter—
the untoward weather for the last fortnight and other circumstances, till to day. I sailed yesterday with my family from Bridgeton for S’ Marks and shall arrive there with a reasonable passage some days previous to the meeting of the Legislative Council of the Territory, before which my presence is not absolutely necessary. As some

invidious persons might otherwise possibly take occassion to find in my absence from Florida since September grounds upon which to endeavor to injure me at Washington I have thought it advisable to apprise you of the reasons of my protracted detention so much beyond what I wished or expected. I was ready with my family a fortnight since, but I thought I ought not to disregard a subpoena served upon me to give evidence in an important cause in the Supreme Court of U.S. in which I was formerly counsel and where my testimony could not be taken properly by deposition. The case was tried the day before yesterday in Bridgeton and I left the State the moment I was discharged.
I will be greatly obliged to you to see that the letters sent by me to the State Dep" which I understood were handed to the Sect” of the Navy are returned and filed with the other papers in the Dept relating to myself as they may be of use to me on some future occasion."

The authority required can no doubt be readily obtained from the Chiefs, thro' Major Phagan the agent, and without much delay. You will be pleased, therefore, * An announcement of the formation of a law partnership by Westcott and John P.

<place-time>BALTIMORE D2cember 4th 1830.</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR. Before the conversation with you, I had rece" a letter from Gen Call enquiring when the cases of Forbes and Arredondo would be taken up before the Supreme Court, and expressing the hope that they might both be tried at the same term, because being engaged in both on the side of the Government his convenience would be promoted by having them both tried at the same term, so as to give him but one trip to Washington. I have answered Gen Call that he might rely on my doing whatever was in my power to accommodate him; that it was not entirely certain that the Supreme Court would take up the Causes out of their order on the docket and that if they would not there was no likelihood of the causes being reached at the approaching term. But that they had taken up cases where a great number of persons were concerned in the decision and the case of great magnitude either on account of the value of the subject, or its operation as a precedent for the decision of other cases that I
thought it not improbable, therefore, that if both the government and the opposite party wished the cases finally decided at this term that it might be done—The records have not yet come up—that of Forbes is I understand extremely voluminous. It is possible that it may not reach us by the time of the Session of the Court; and when it does reach us I shall require to have a copy made out that I may study the cause for the clerk will not suffer the original to leave the Court—At what period of the session I may be able to get such copy it is impossible to devise-I can only say that if it be the desire of the Government to have it tried at the approaching term no exertion shall be wanting on my part to meet their wishes—and that if it be possible for me, after being furnished with a copy of the record, to master the cause in all its parts, so as to be able to do it justice, no objection to the argument will come from me—But I cannot consent to argue causes of so much magnitude without time to master them perfectly in all points. To this purpose the presence of Gen Call & yourself would

greatly contribute, as you have both already argued that of Forbes—
and with such aid, if I can get my copy by the middle of the term I
have no fear of being able to do it justice before the Court rises, if they shall consent to take it out of its turn. The embarrass-arises from putting Gen Call to the inconvenience of coming on, in the uncertainty of the trial. For it is uncertain whether we shall get the record in time, & if we do, it will still be uncertain whether the Court will take it up out of its turn. This last uncertainty might be removed on the first day of the term (if the record shall then have reach reached us) for we can move the Court to fix a day for the trial, but then notice will have to be forwarded to Gen" Call & he would have to come on—all which, at that season of the year, would probably make it the last of February before he w” arive—But still if the Government have any particular solicitude that the causes should be tried at this term, it w" be desirable to know it, that every step in our power may be taken to meet their wishes—I understand Gen' Call to have been engaged by the private claimants under the U.S. in one of Forbes' claims & by the Government in the other, and to have been retained also by the Government in Arrededos' case to assist in the argument in the Supreme Court. This being the case it would be indelicate & improper in me to propose to argue the causes in his absence—and indeed since he has been retained (I should be unwilling to lose the benefit of his assistance)
As you are going down to Washington, it may perhaps come in your way in the course of conversation to know whether the Government has any special wish on the subject of bringing on these cases at the approaching term and whether, under the uncertainties which I have stated, it would be deemed expedient to write to Gen'Call to come on. M. Berrien too could say whether it be the wish of the other side to bring on the cases.
Yours respectfully W WIRT

<place-time>[December 10, 1830]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States.
The undersigned Citizens and inhabitants of the Town of Pensacola and County of Escambia in the Western District of the Territory of Florida most respectfully represent to Your Honorable Body that it would be a work of supererogation to recite, or to Comment upon the great advantages which the Port of Pensacola possesses over every other Harbor or Bay in the Gulf of Mexico, whether regard be had to the great depth of water on its bar; to its easiness of access; to the Security of its Capacious Harbor; to its entire freeness from shoals, sand banks or obstructions of any kind; to its extensive ramifications;
to the salubrity of its Climate; its Superior excellence as a watering place; the abundance and heavy growth of live oak and other valuable timber for Ship building, exportation and other purposes; its Commanding situation for the protection of the trade of the whole western region—for which it is the only point d'appui; and in many other respects on which it would be too tedious and irrelevant to dwell, more expecially as the most Striking of these Caused it to be Selected as the principal Naval Station of the South. These advantages in the aggregate are well known to Your Honorable Body. Nature has done for it much; very much; So much, that She has left but little for man to accomplish; but that little renders these invaluable blessings

and advantages in a great measure nugatory for the reasons which it will be the object of this memorial to Specify The only navigable access to the back Country of which the Port of Pensacola is the natural emporium is by means of the Rivers Rscambia & Conecuh; which at Certain Seasons of the Year are obstructed by Considerable rafts of timber, and other obstacles, all which Could be overcome and removed at a Comparatively Small expence, but which would be too great for the individual means of this Community. These Streams flow through the fertile Counties Conecuh, Covington, Dale, Buttler and Pike in the State of Alabama.
The latter nearly unites with or is only divided in the upper part of its Course by a narrow ridge from the Chocta-Hatchie or Pee River and other Streams which empty themselves either into this, Yellow Water or S' Rosas Bay all ramifications of the Bay of Pensacola.
Mostly all the lands Situated thereon are of the Public domain, the Settlement of which is retarded Solely by the difficulties at Present existing in the navigation of the said Rivers, which offer unnumerable Sites for Saw Mills, many of which are now in operation, but from the discouraging Circumstance of their owners only being able to float down their Collected rafts at Certain Seasons, will Soon be abandoned unless a remedy Can be Provided. Not less are the difficulties of ascending the Said Rivers with the necessary Supplies for the Plantations thereon or of descending with their Products, by reason of which the agricultural and Commercial interests of the whole Community are Seriously affected. Were it otherwise; were these obstacles removed a new impetus would be given to the united industry of the Country in the greatly accumulated increase of the growth of the principal Staple of the Country, Cotton—in the great augmentation of the quantities of Red Cedar and Staves, and of other Valuable timber and lumber, Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Turpentine &" &” These are a few of the Private and local advantages which would result from the Clearing and rendering navigable these Streams, nor would they be less important in a national Point of view, inasmuch as they would afford increased facilities for transportation of Troops, Provisions and military Supplies in time of war at a Small expence from the very heart of the Country—the State of Alabama and Georgia.
When so many and Such great advantages Could be obtained at a Comparatively inconsiderable expenditure, and having, as it were, before us the recent proofs of the aid which Your Honorable Body has with a wisely regulated liberality extended to other Sections of this Territory and it being the first time that we have Solicited any Similar aid, we now with the more Animating Confidence most respectfully & earnestly invoke Your Honorable Body to make an

appropriation for the objects aforesaid for which the Sum of Twenty five thousand Dollars would be Commensurate to its accomplishment—

<docbody>SIR. The case of Fernando de la Maza Arredondo & others against the United States instituted under the act of 23* May 1828 * for
289.645.5/7 acres of land Situated at Alachua in this District having been decided by our Courts in favour of the claimants and an appeal having been duly taken therein on behalf of the United States to the Supreme Court I herewith send to your care a transcript of the record of Said case to be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court.”
I had intended to send you the transcript open so that you could examine it before it was filed but a late rule of our Court required the Clerk to Seal it up and direct it to the Clerk of the Supreme Court, another copy cannot at this time be procured from our Clerk owing to a great press of business in his office, if however another transcript of this record is desired for your office please inform me and I will have it made out and forwarded as soon as possible. I have been at a loss to determine whether the provision in your late circular which the District attorney in all cases in which a writ of error or appeal is taken &c. to send a transcript of the record to your office accompanied by a report of the argument in the Court below noting the points made
& authorities referred to by the respective Counsel, was intended to embrace this class of cases or not, nevertheless I accompany this by such report and Same therein noted the points made and the authorities referred by the counsel respectively—The interest of the United States as well as of the claimants seems to require a final disposition of the land cases taken up from the Courts of this Territory as soon as it can be done consistently with a full and fair examination of them

in the Court above, but the case of Colin Mitchel and others has been decided by the judge of the Middle District in favour of the United States and it is believed that many points have arisen & been decided in that case which have also been decided in this I mention this fact supposing that it would be desirable to the government as well as to the Supreme Court that both of these cases (as they are very important ones and embrace most of the points which will arise in the various land Suits in the Territory) should be before that court before a final decision is made in either case and as it rests with the petitioners in that case to take the appeal and the record is very voluminous it is more than probable that it will not be carried up in time to be acted upon at the next term of that Court. The case of Juan Percheman against the United States" which was instituted under the act of
26" May 1830 * entitled—“an act for the final Settlement of land claims in Florida upon a claim for 2000 acres of land has just been decided in favour of the claimants, as soon as I return from the Circuit I shall prepare a Statement of the case & the evidence & of the points of law decided by the Court in that case agreably to the provision of the act of 23” May 1828 * an enclose it to you In these land cases I have no taxable fees but rely upon the justice of the President for Such “Extra compensation” as he is authorised to make by the act last above mentioned Will you therefore be so good as to inform me in what manner or rather by what rule that compensation will be made and instruct me how I ought to make out my accounts and what vouchers will be necessary to enable me to obtain it.

<docbody>DEAR SIR,-I have been so much occupied since my arrival, that I have not had time to drop you a line. At the beginning of a short session with 250 adjourned bills on the Calendar it is impossible to accomplish any thing of a local nature, if it is not presented in both Houses of Congress, and pressed with all possible despatch. As we have no representative in the Senate, my labours are doubled. I
prepare two copies of all the bills I want passed. As soon as I arrived here, I addressed an official note to the Secretary of the Treasury,”
informing him that the claimants of the Chactawhachie grant, did not intend to appeal, and requesting that orders might be given for the survey of all the country west of Appalachicola, and North of St. Andrews. An estimate has been made for an appropriation, and instructions will be speedily given to that effect.
The final determination of that claim will remove the opposition to any legislation upon the canal between St. Andrews and Chipola,”
an object highly interesting to the country, and desirable to the people of Jackson. I have felt a deep solicitude on the subject of this improvement, and shall urge it with all the influence I can raise.
There will be an increased appropriation for the removal of obstructions in Appalachicola River.”
I have also invited the attention of the Government to the necessity of an Arsenal on the Appalachicola.”
The removal of the Indians I learn from the President will await the decission of the Government upon the Creek negotiation.

Whave proposed amendments to the preemption law so as to embrace a\ whose lands are not surveyed, and all who live on fractions.
I have drawn a bill for the reduction of the price of the Pine lands.”
I do not think any other will ever pass the House of Representatives.
I consider this one of the most important acts that can be passed for Florida. My proposition is to reduct it to 50 cents, and after it has been in market two years to 25 cents. I have handed Col. King of the Senate, a copy of the bill, and he will introduce it in the Senate.
Two Engineers are gone to make experimental surveys on the summit level of the Florida Canal to ascertain the practicability of obtaining water.
The House of Representatives to day “nullified” a proposition to reduce the duty on Sugar, it would not consider the motion.
A new member will most probably be given to Madison and Hamilton.”
I was not mistaken when I predicted that the Federal patronage of the Government was not under the control of those who threaten and promise in the name of the President. You have your Commission or will soon receive it—to print the laws of the United States.”
I am Yours &c.

<docbody>HON. JOS M. WHITE H. R.
SIR, Agreeably to your wishes "I have embraced as early an opportunity as possible of communicating with you on the subject of the line of demarkation between the Territory of Florida and State of Alabama, & herewith transmit for your information a plat of the public surveys over which that line passes. The Southern termination of the surveys made under the superintendence of the Surveyor of public Lands in Alabama did not extend to the 31° of latitude, which is the Southern boundary of Alabama between the Chattahootchie and the Perdido rivers. From the correspondence, copies of which are herewith transmitted, you will perceive that the Surveyor Gen.'

of Florida was required to survey the public lands up to the termination of Gen Coffee's surveys, in the execution of which service the Surveyors crossed the line of the 31° of latitude, ascertained & marked by Andrew Ellicott, as the line of demarkation of the Southern limits of the United States, and now the boundary between the State &
Territory alluded to. In extending the surveys of Florida over the line of the 31e of lat. the Surveyors did not retrace the line run by Andrew Ellicott so as to enable them to exhibit on the township plats the fractional Sections of land on each side of the line. They only indicate that line on their surveys where they crossed the same, or where it was identified with the line of their survey.”
It appearing to me to be the proper course of proceeding, I therefore suggest it to you, & take leave through you to suggest the same idea to the Alabama delegation, that this line should be retraced under the authority of the U. States' Surveyor acting in concert with a Surveyor to be appointed by the State of Alabama, and that it be made the duty of the Surveyor General of Florida to connect the line with the public surveys on both sides thereof as it is retraced, and that if any difficulty should occur in retracing the line, the Commissioners should, as occasion may require, take the latitude. This proceeding, it appears to me, would be satisfactory to the inhabitants of Florida residing in the vicinity of the line as well as those in Alabama, by removing any doubts that now exist as to which side of the line they reside on. It is also of importance to the respective political and legislative jurisdictions of the State and Territory aforesaid.
The strip of land North of the 31° lat: & South of the termination of Coffee's surveys is already made a part of the Sparta land district, by the Act of 11" May 1820 organizing that Land district (vide Land laws p. 775)" and I would propose that provision be made by law, “that patents should be issued for such tracts of land sold and paid for at the Land Office at Tallahassee in the Territory of Florida as are found to be situate within the limits of the district of lands subject to sale at Sparta in the State of Alabama agreeably to the terms of the Act organizing that District.”
With the papers accompanying this communication will be found a list of the Tracts sold at Tallahassee which are above referred to.”
I am. &c E. HAYWARD.

BELEGATE WHITE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLA-
TIVE COUNCIL
[FSL:Fla. Legis. Council, Journal:M*]
WASHINGTON Decr. 26th. 1830.
To THE PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL of the Territory of Florida.
SIRI At the last session of the Honorable body over which you preside; a resolution, transmitted to me by its order, invited my attention to the subject of a grant supposed to have been made, or rather indicating a wish of a preceding Council, that a grant should be made to Richard C. Allen Esqr. for certain services in making selections under an act of Congress, passed in 1826,” authorising the location of two townships of land, for seminaries of learning, in our Territory.—I
am requested to make a report on the subject; at the next session to the Council. Entertaining a profound respect for their wishes, and feeling every disposition to co-operate with them, in the trust committed to us by our common constitutents, I shall proceed to submit, for their consideration, a brief report.
The first act of Congress granted, for a specified object, two townships land in entire bodies,” the selection of which might have been made, without difficulty or trouble, by the Governor of the Territory, upon whom that duty has usually developed, as a part of his Executive Agency, in the execution of the laws of the U. States. When I
arrived here, in the station I now hold, in 1825, I ascertained that the lands intended to be set apart by that act, had not yet been selected and reserved, and believing that the fund for Education might be enhanced to a value greatly exceeding that in referred to, I applied to Congress and obtained a modification of the law, so as to allow the unlocated land, to be selected in sections, which was granted by a special act,'—The labour of locating, in small bodies, was certainly increased by the new act, as much as the value of the donation; but I do not conceive that this either rendered the employment of a special agent necessary, or made his experiences a charge upon the fund set a part for education. When that resolution reached here, proposing to give two sections of land, for locating the remainder, it was not

considered necessary to annul it, because it was viewed as a nullity itself, for the want of power in the Legislative Council, to legislate in any manner upon the subject.
The first act of Congress set apart two townships of land for a special purpose—the supplemental act did not change its provision in that respect. It was therefore a reservation made by Congress of a portion of the public domain for education in the Territory of Florida. The U. States, in making the reservation, conveyed no jurisdiction to any other Legislative Tribunal, to carry the grant into effect, or to entertain jurisdiction over it.
The Governor and Legislative Council therefore had no more right, by law or resolution, to grant away this land, than they had to grant the U. States land or private property. It is doubtful whether the granting authority, (Congress), could devote any portion of the proceeds of these reserved lands, for any other than the object named as the consideration of the Legislative grant. The resolution was therefore considered void, by a committee of Congress, before whom it was laid, or I should have insisted upon a law annulling it.
The execution of the laws of the U. States is entrusted by the Constitution, to the President, and the expences of carrying them into effect, are borne by the U. States. To obviate any difficulty arising from a failure to make a specific appropriation, there is usually provided by Congress, a miscellaneous fund, to pay for all objects directed by law, where there is no enumerated appropriation.
I do not consider the Territory in any wise, responsible for the services rendered or under an obligation to make compensation for them in land, or money—and the resolution passed first on the subject, being void ab initio, would have remained so, without the one rescinding it.
I had the subject referred to a committee at the last session of Congress, with a statement of the agent explaining the nature &
extent of his services, and if Congress had been disposed to grant him other lands for his services, I should have advocated any Bill for a reasonable compensation, but according to my conceptions of the laws for reserving the lands, I should have felt it to be my imperious duty, to preserve them for the meritorious objects for which it was set apart."
I have the honor to be, with high considerations of respect, Yr.
most obt. servant, JOS. M. WHITE.

<docbody>HONB le JOHN H. EATON Secretary of War SIR, I have just received a letter from Samuel S. Hamilton Esq. of the Indian Department dated 4" of December last," in which I am informed that my draft for $1000 drawn on you by express directions from your department, you have declined to pay.
I am convinced, Sir, you must have forgotten that during my visit

to the City last winter and Spring, the subject of my orders in relations to the eight Indian boys, which I have sent to the Indian Academy in Kentucky," was the subject of conversation more than once–And I
am confident, the Honb" R. M. Johnson was present. I have never, Sir, presumed to draw on any department of the Government for any sum but by their express order and such was given in the present instance.
I am, sure, that the whole course of your public conduct, will sustain me in saying, that no fear of official responsibility will ever influence you to do an act that may either injure, or reflect on the character of an officer who has acted in Strict obedience to your instructions I will on this occasion state to you that in the Spring 1826, I was directed by the Department to assemble the Chiefs of the Seminole Nation and endeavour to impress upon them, the importance of establishing a School at the Agency for the instruction of their Children "-In conformity with my instructions, every effort was used to accomplish the views of the Government—The Chiefs at the Agency after several days of consultation refused their consent to have a school, or to educate their children"—The Chiefs on the Appalachicola River, five in number, entertain different views, and are exceedingly anxious to educate their youth—The eight Indian Boys now in Kentucky are the sons of Col John Blount and other chiefs on the Appalachicola River—They are as much entitled to the benefit under the treaty as the Indians residing at the Agency, and of course to a partition of the school fund—I trust therefore the draft will be paid. I shall certainly direct the Agent, as you desire to obtain the consent in writing of the chiefs at the Agency (as they have no school and will not accept of one) requesting the Secretary of War to dispose of the fund of education at such school as he may select—The chiefs are now out hunting and it will be some time before they can be assembled for this object, but in the meantime I consider it but as a common act of justice to myself and the holders of the draft that it should be paid "

There yet remains three miles and a Bridge over the Canal of about forty feet to be made which I shall have done by Contract I think it can be done cheaper in that way than otherwise as there are a number of persons in that part of the country engaged in cutting live oak many of whom are Carpenters and the opening of the Road would be much to their advantage”

GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[Fla., Legis. Council, Journal: M*]
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE. Jan. 17th. 1831.
SIR, In the message which I had the honor to submit to the Council, at the opening of the present session, I deemed it my duty to call their attention to the subject of a revision of the Laws of the Territory.
Whether the adoption of measures for the revision of the statutes, and formation of a general code, in the manner adopted by the States of New York, Louisiana, and Virginia is deemed advisable or not, by the Council at this time, the publication of the Laws heretofore passed, into better shape than at present, appears tomeof sufficient importance

to authorise my calling your attention specially to that subject.
In a communication made by the Secretary to the Council on the
15th inst.” through the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, the making of the contracts for the publication of the laws of this Session in news-papers and in pamphlet form, was referred entirely to the Council. I deem it proper however to apprise the Council, that the number of copies ordered to be published last year was insufficient for general distribution. A number of public Officers in the counties of Leon and Gadsden, have not been furnished, owing to the dificiency.
To enable such general distribution amongst the public officers and citizens of the Territory, as is advisable, and also to the Executives and Legislatures of the different States, and of the U. States, it is necessary that at least 950 copies should be annually printed. The publication of that number of the laws of this session, and in future, will not however, remedy the inconvenience remitting from the deficiency of past years. There are now in the Executive Office, but
20 copies of the laws of 1822; and about the same number of the laws of 1823, 1824, 1826 and 1827. Of the laws of 1825, 1828 and 1829 there are but 2 complete copies, exclusive of those furnished the Council a few days since.
It is known too that but few copies of the loose pamphlets, in which they were published, can be had in the different counties of this Territory. In a few years, there will be none extant. References to the Laws passed during these years, although they may have been repealed, is often indispensable. Disputes and litigation may arise upon contracts formed under them, and which must be determined by them.
Some of the repealed statutes, of those years may be revived by re-enactment, referring to their title alone. The experience of every state in the Union, has shown the policy, if not absolute necessity, of collecting periodically, as experience may dictate, and embodying and preserving, in as condensed a form as possible, the whole body of Laws enacted by their Legislatures. I must therefore respectfully call the attention of the Council to this subject and suggest the expediency of publishing, in one volume, all the statutes of this Territory, since its organization—with notes and references made by some legal gentleman, to be appointed by the Council for that purpose, pursuing the method adopted in the publication of the acts of Congress. I am informed that such publication could probably be made in a Volume of about 500 pages, including the laws of this session. In case the Council should deem it advisable, to adopt this course, I have no doubt that if the appropriation made last year by Congress is insuffi-

cient, to defray the expense, the General Government will not withhold the deficiency, upon being acquainted with the importance and necessity of the measure. I would also respectfully recommend to the Council, the Enactment of a law, regulating the annual publication of the Laws and prescribing the manner of their distribution & designating to whom they shall be distributed.
The propriety and expediency, of permitting a certain number of copies to be held annually for sale, to many persons in and out of the Territory, who cannot otherwise obtain them, is also recommended to the Council.”
I am Sir, very respectfully, Yr. obt. servt.

<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled.
The memorial of the undersigned, Citizens and Landholders of the Territory Florida respectfully shew that nothwithstanding the very liberal Acts that have been passed from time to time respecting grants made by the Spanish Government, there are still some grantees, that

have been unable to avail themselves of the Laws passed in their favor.
One Class of these are persons who were minors and till very lately had not possession of the papers which contained their titles and were therefore unable to lay them before the proper authorities before the limitation of time for confirmation expired.
Another Class were non-residents who had not learned that an opportunity existed of getting their titles confirmed. A third class were industrious Citizens of the Territory who were until lately ignorant that Laws had been passed in their favor.” A fourth class are those whose grants are located on lands previously granted to other persons without their knowledge; And a large class of citizens who had obtained grants after the month of February January 1818
without any knowledge of the pending treaty. Most of these grants were made for services actually rendered to the Spanish Government, for which no restitution could be now obtained should they be deprived of their lands. To be removed from lands which were lawfully obtained under a full belief that the title was perfect and after many years of improvement for no fault of the settler would be a very hard case and such a one as your Memorialists hope and trust the humanity of your Hon”* Body will prevent. In full confidence of which, your Memorialists pray that such amendments may be made to the Land-Laws now existing, as will remedy the existing evils and do honor to the humanity of the Nation, And Your Memorialists will pray.

I am instructed to inform you in reply to your Communication of the 15th inst,” that some misapprehension seems to exist as to the cause of the assignment of Post Route N° 2392—from Milledgeville to Tallahassee, to Messr"Mallett " & Mott, instead of to M' Macomb the late Contractor—The Proposal of M" Macomb was to carry the mail as advertised for the annual compensation of $3,000-
Messrs Mallette & Mott proposed to carry the mail on this route for $3.000 pran—& expedite so as to run through each way 24 hours earlier than was stipulated in the Advertisement—this was the reason why the route was assigned to those Gentlemen instead of to M.”
Macomb both parties are considered equally responsible, & there can be no doubt M Macomb would have faithfully & punctually complied with the requisitions of his Contract provided the route had been given to him-It is with pleasure the P.

<docbody>DEAR SIR If my wounded limb would permit me to ride I would go up to see you on the subject of the land claims from Florida and Missouri which are now before the Supreme Court—and with regard to which it is necessary that I should have some conversation with you, before I commence the examination of these subjects—The record in the single case of Forbes is upwards of 600 pages, folio—
besides a large pile of original documents—Arredondos, I am told, is nearly if not quite as large—It is impossible for the clerk to make copies of these records in time to prepare for the argument at this term—The strong desire expressed by you in behalf of the Government that they should now be argued, makes it necessary that some other expedient should be adopted on this, as well as other subjects connected with these cases, I am desirous of seeing you as soon as convenient—The court will not now be more than five or six weeks in session and there is no time to be lost—can you make it convenient to give me a call in the course of the day—There are millions of acres of the most valuable lands in Florida depending on these claims—
and there is a formidable array of counsel on the other Side—It is therefore my desire that I may be able to argue them to the best advantage for the Government—and that every facility sh" be afforded to my preparation Yours respectfuly Wm WIRT

<docbody>SIR, The contract with Mr Wirt was, that he was to have a retaining fee of $1,000 in the cases of the Forbes and Arredondo in Florida and of Soulard in Missouri, with an additional fee for arguing each of those cases in the Supreme Court, and for such others as the President might deem proper to employ assistant counsel in. That of Soulard and one other was argued at the last term. In each of these Mr Wirt received $1,000 which was considered by the President as a presedent for the subsequent cases in which M. Wirt is engaged. It is to be observed that as all these cases depend on the same principle, the preparation for one, so far as they depend upon similarity of principle, is a preparation for all. In this respect, the additional fee of $1000 in each case, is deemed by the President a liberal compensation, and I directed to Say that it will be allowed I am respectfully Y” ob" Ser"

<docbody>GENERAL I returned yesterday from an examination of the road contracted for, to be made in obedience to your order of the 28th July last,” the road is now completed from Alaqua to oak hill, from that to Mariana there is yet no direct road & the unexpended balance
$200. would fall very far short of making one that distance, 16 miles, but having been informed when there last Oct. that a road was to be made between those two places by the inhabitants, under the direction of the County Court, I intended to apply that balance to improving it when cut out, it has not yet been done however owing (the Judge of the Court tells me) to the neglect of the persons who were app" to the direction of it. He says it will be made he thinks in the course of the coming Spring I find there are on the west side of Alaqua and near to it, two small streams which appear to require Bridges, but which are not embraced in my instructions they are I believe passable for horses at all times.
Nor do I think there is often if ever so much water in them as to prevent the passage of a Carriage, but the banks near the water are of quicksand which makes it dificult if not dangerous for a carriage or waggon to pass in time of high water, The cost to Bridge both would be about seventy five or eighty dollars"

Whitehead Esq. of Key West” together with the plat” of that Island, and to ask your opinion whether the survey made by him, being duly

sworn to and returned regularly into the office in conformity with the usual forms, can be received or not—the difficulty of procuring a survey of that Island without subjecting a Deputy Surveyor to the expence of at least 2008 beyond his compensation would render such a course very desirable, if consistent with your views—

SIR My not arriving here until 22" Ins" must be my apology for not before noticing the reception of the documents directed to me from your Office under date of 29* Nov. last.—
To obtain the area of the Island at low water with any degree of precision I conceive hardly probable from its locality—I meandered the whole coast of the Island during the month of February 1829 running the chain at ordinary high water mark and it was from my survey that the enclosed Map was lithographed.—The supposition that it would only be necessary for me to swear to the correctness of my survey which I can do and furnish you with my courses and distances and a Map, induced me to have the subject mentioned to a gentleman through whom I expect it was made known to you.—
It is only some few parts of the Island that are much effected by the tides, those places I have marked on the enclosed map with a pen.—
If my certifying to the correctness of my survey as I have above stated will be sufficient, please inform me upon what scale you would wish the Island protracted—if not, I must take the liberty to decline making the re-survey as it will interfer with my other duties—
I shall keep the documents received from the office until I again hear from you.-

[Enclosure:DS]
Resolution by the Legislative Council
[January 1831]
Whereas there have been annually appropriated since eighteen hundred and twenty four by the congress of the United States, thirty

thousand dollars for surveys of Roads and Canals none of which, it is believed, has ever been expended in the Territory of Florida; and as the only Surveys ever made, have not been by the direction of the President, (who has by law the power, to dispose of that appropriation); but under special laws of the United States; and as this Legislative Council entertain the opinion, that there are works of Internal improvement in this Territory of essential interest to its inhabitants and connected with great national improvements in which the Western and south-western states are deeply concerned; in which no Constitutional question can be presented, the advantages of which have been disclosed in addresses and letters to committees of Congress and their reports thereon.
Be it therefore resolved, That the President be and he is hereby requested to cause to be specially Surveyed, and an estimate of the cost presented, of Canals to connect Mobile and Pensacola Bays, and thence persuing a line along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico between Choctawhachie Bay and river and the West arm of St Andrews Bay and from the East side of St Andrews to Chipola river, and to the Appalachicola, with a view of opening a channel of Internal communication for the conveyance of the products of the Mississippi to the various points on the northern Coast of the said Gulf of Mexico.”
Resolved further, That the President be requested to cause a survey and estimate of a Canal from St Mary's river by St Augustine and through the intervening sections of land to form a continous navigation from that point to the Florida Keys with a view to a Steam Boat navigation inland through the sounds, Bays and rivers, of Florida, and the existing Sounds north of it from Charleston & Savannah to Cuba.
Beit further resolved that a copy of these resolutions be immediately enclosed to our Delegate in Congress requesting him to lay the same before the President.”

Be it therefore resolved, That our Delegate in Congress be requested to endeavour to obtain the passage of a Law, authorising persons, who, through ignorance of the Laws, or other circumstances, have omitted to file their claims before the late Board, for the settlement of land claims, to file the same before the Superior court of said district, or such other Tribunal as may be deemed proper.”
The foregoing is a correct copy of a pre-amble and resolution adopted by the Late Legislative Council of Florida.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to report for the information of the Commander in chief that I arrived here in the ship S. Louis on the 19*

after a long & very boisterous passage of twenty days."—As yet I
am unable to make a more particular report to the General, then, that, what has been called sand on this island is nothing more than pulverized shells, & I am truly apprehensive that I shall be unable to build of Tapia: I have just discharged the Cargo & shall now be enabled to look more about, when a further report will be made; I have not yet received my instructions, and some of the proprieters do not think they are now bound to the United States on the offer formerly made for a scite; therefore, without specific instructions, I shall be much at a loss what to do. I am unauthorized to contract for land to build on
& am fearful I shall have to await orders. On the passage I lost one man by death, the only tailor I had—I have since heard learned that two tailors had arrived at Bedloe's Island after my recruits had been arranged & I must request that the Superintendent may be instructed to send me that number. They can be sent very easily by Capt Hitchcock (a regular trader from N. Y. to Pensacola) of the Brig Enterprise, who passes thro’ the North west passage, & in sight of this place: I am much in want of them, as I shall not even be enabled to hire.”

The proposition to change the line of stages lately established from Pensacola to Talahassee so as to run from Mount Vernon at the mouth of Flint River to Bainbridge and there terminate would be highly displeasing to the inhabitants of Pensacola and Talahassee and much more expence to the Department than at present It is the first and only stage route ever established entirely within the bounds of Florida and to divert this to a terminating point in Georgia would not give satisfaction though ther might be another route crossing that point to Talahassee and the proprietors of the line if not permitted to carry the passengers to Talahassee or if required to increase their distance to do so, would consider it a loss.
for which they would justly claim indemnity from the department.
It would be more eligable to establish a distinct route from Mount Vernon to Bainbridge which if the law would autherize it would give the Post Master General pleasure to do. As it now is if any person will transport a weekly mail from Mount Vernon to Bainbridge a distance I should suppose of less than 30 miles for the proceeds of the office of offices which would be established on it. The Post Master General will willingly establish the route, but he is not autherized to incur a quarter expence when the route is not laid down by law "

I have been recently informed that the claimants to the tract of land West of the Appalachicola river, (which you directed me to have Surveyed as p" diagram sent me) have declined taking an appeal to the Supreme Court, and I have therefore deemed it my duty to proceed to the Survey of the same under y' instructions, and for which purpose I have forwarded contracts to be signed by two Dep”

<place-time>WASHINGTON, March 10th 1831.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR:—I had the honour to submit some days since, for the consideration of the President, various letters and the memorial of a respectable portion of the people of the Territory, I represent," respectfully remonstrating against the re-appointment of William P. Duval, as Governor of Florida. I presented, sometime before, the charges of William Wyatt, implicating the official conduct of the Governor, and asking an investigation. When the papers containing these complaints against his administration of the Territorial Government came into my hands, at the session before the last, I presented them from a sense of indispensible official obligation, disclaiming all knowledge of the facts stated, and desiring not to be connected with, or responsible for any thing communicated. I had no knowledge of the transactions which were made the subject of the memorial to the President, and from a most sincere and unaffected desire, to avoid the remotest connection with it, I did not wish to make myself even acquainted with them. I supposed of course, that when accusations, so seriously affecting the character of a public officer were preferred to the constitutional authority to make the examination, and apply the corrective, that the party accused, if innocent, would be the first to demand the strictest scrutiny and minutest investigation.”
The right of a citizen to present his petition, was one of so unquestionable, and impervative a character that I could have no hesitation as to my duty, to lay it before the Executive and leave it to such order as he might think proper to take on the subject.—Governor Duval instead of meeting these complaints, in that manly spirit which innocence always displays, shrunk from investigation, and loaded the petitioner with every species of vituperation and abuse. It appeared to me that his character or motives, had nothing to do with the merits of the question referred to the President. The truth of the charges was the important inquiry to the government, and the citizens. From the course that this thing has taken, however, one would be induced to think that the prosecutor himself was on trial, and the Governor and his friends his accusers. Strange and extraordinary as this pro-

ceeding appeared to me, I was still reluctant even to look into the charges and evidence, from the unalterable disgust with which I
recoil from all private or public controversies. Finding myself however assailed with utmost intolerance for this simple act of public duty, in presenting a petition of the contents of which I had no knowledge, and never encouraged, having my suspicions excited, too, from the attempt to put down injury by abuse, and denunciation, I pledged myself to demand an investigation. The course of Gov. Duval had called forth my letter of the 30th of October last, a copy of which is herewith enclosed,” and having thus vindicated myself from his unprovoked attacks, I was still unwilling to enter into a controversy between him, and Mr Wyatt. I made a polite request of the President to order an investigation into the alledged abuses in the disbursements of the pulic funds, and was told that the memorial was disposed of without affording the petitioner an opportunity for proof, and that it could not be touched or re-examined without new charges which, when made should be referred, to a special agent to examine them.
They were again presented with various additional allegations of oppression, embezzlement, and mal-administration—and upon this I
only asked an investigation. I was requested by the Secretary to call upon the President, who advised me to reconsider the subject or to make out charges myself, as the most unfavourable representations were made of the character of Mr. Wyatt. I then determined so far as it depended on me, no officer of the government of any rank, should evade charges affecting the reputation of the Territory, I represent by groundless imputations upon the character of the individual presenting them. I then addressed to the Pres’t. the letter bearing date the 24 of Feb. last.” I was told that the Pres’t. had ordered an examination of the records and found that they furnished no evidence of any impropriety in the charges, and as he did me the favor to exhibit to me the representations on the part of the Gov. I determined to withdraw the papers with a view of giving to them a nearer examination, and if I found that the slightest injustice was likely to be done to the Governor, or if the charges were contradicted by the records never to present them again. I regret to say that I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion to which the President seemed to have arrived, and with the greatest possible respect I beg leave to suggest, that if the President will take time to read the papers submitted, he will see that there has been a double charge as alledged.
The paper marked (B) is the original account of Governor Duval paid by Col. Walton up to the 31st December 1825.” The papers

from the Department (F) shew that for a part of the same time the Governor charged and received the rent from the United States. The account of Col. Walton is rendered afterwards with this voucher and the allowance refused because the Governor had already been paid by the United States. It cannot be denied that he was paid by Col.
Walton and by the United States for the same rent, and Col. Walton is made the debtor of the Government, because of the double payment of the Governor. If there is truth in the records of the Treasury, in the Report of the Auditor and the original receipt of the Governor, this charge is sustained.
In relation to these accounts without going into details, the fact is unquestionable, that the Governor not only expended the customary sum appropriated for contingences, but actually had accounts audited in one year requiring an increase of appropriation to three times the usual sum.
If it be true that stationary to the amount of $240 62% cents was furnished for the Executive Office in 1828, in adition to that furnished to the Legislative Council, it must at least be considered a most extravagant allowance. .
I was told too that the office had been examined and there was nothing to be found on the subject of the excessive and improper charge for furnishing corn for the Indians. The charge as I understand it, is that Samuel Y. Garey offered to furnish the corn to the perishing Indians at a more convenient place for them at 70 or 75
cents per Bushel, and that Major Chaires offered to take the contract at one dollar per Bushel, and that the Governor gave the contract to M. Crupper at $225 per Bushel to be delivered at Tampa Bay. The latter fact may be ascertained by an inspection of the records of the War Department.”
The other however, which is the important matter, can only be established by the evidence of Messrs. Garey and Chaires. I know that when I was at the Agency in May 1827, some rotten corn was hauled from Tampa Bay to that place, at an expense equal to the offer of Mr Garey, for the transportion alone, and I think no human being could have lived upon it, such was its state of deterioration.
This miserable and decayed material had undergone that process in transportation which renders it unfit even for horses. Col. Brooke had not long before informed the Government that the Indians were perishing from starvation, and Congress made this appropriation to relieve them from the most afflicting misery. If it be true that the bounty of the Government was thus wasted to fill the pockets of a favourite merchant, to whom the Governor was indebted, it deserves

it would seem to me a little more consideration than a passing de-
Inunciation on the person making the accusation. All these charges are not made by Mr. Wyatt alone, but by various other persons, and among others Col. Humphries, late Indian agent, against whose personal integrity, and private worth I am not aware that any thing can be said.
The President did me the honour to exhibit to me a letter of Governor Duval, to his private Secretary, which although marked “private”
he perceived was intended for public effect, and in the frankness of his character, not wishing to countenance concealed attacks, he handed it to me for my perusal.
Without that letter you would have been most probably spared the trouble of reading this. A man who is under no necessity of concealment, and whose conduct can bear the test of scrutiny, does not write abusive letters marked “private” to have a public influence. This letter set out with giving an account of the circulation of a petition by Mr. Kingsley of East Florida, which petition the Governor says was drawn by myself. The charge is without the slighest foundation in truth, and the Governor knew it to be false when he made the suggestion. Mr. Kingsley is a classical scholar, who would consider it a degradation to be put on a footing with Governor Duval in point of intellect, or education. This gentleman has a large property in the Territory and exercising the right of a citizen, had written a respectful petition to the President, praying that some other person should be appointed Governor.
For this flagrant offence, the letter in question was written indicating the most intolerant spirit and going into the private history and alledged vices of the petitioner, in so coarse and gross a manner as not to allow a repetition here. The Governor then proceeds to give an account of the prodigious excitement of the people the seizure of the paper by force, the bon-fire, and the threatened destruction of the petitioner and his timely and energetic interference, to prevent personal violence, and the consequent apology of the writer to save himself from destruction. The whole story, I am assured by the most respectable gentlemen, is untrue, and the account of it is a libel on the people of East Florida. They are not such Bullies and Blackguards as the account would induce one to think, but a quiet, orderly, and respectable population. The manner in which the petition was obtained from Mr. Kingsley is disclosed in his letter which accompanies this paper and in which he encloses a second petition to the President. If a respectable gentleman cannot petition for a redress of grievances without such assaults upon his private character, we are under the dominion of our provincial Satrap, in a worse condition

than we were under the Spanish Government. The Governor proceeds to inform the Secretary that “White is down!” and will be beaten ten to one, and if the President would order him to Washington he would put his (White's) character before the nation in an odious light. This sentiment alone in my humble judgement ought to cause his dismission from office. He consults his wishes rather than his judgement in announcing the first fact, that I am down and whether I am to be beaten or not, is a question for the people to decide.
How impertinent to suppose that the President would order him here to traduce me!!! When he speaks of being ordered here, I
understand from some acquaintance with his former habits, that he desires to be ordered on public business so that his expenses may be paid, while the avowed object is to place me before the nation in an odious light. So late as February 1829 in a letter to me, he speaks with great indignation of the calumnies against me, does not “credit a word of them,” and expresses his regard for me. I am not aware of any offence since that time, and must conclude that he expected that such a letter would never reach my eye.
The President also, exhibited to me a letter of R. C. Allen Esqr. to Judge White" of the Senate and another of one Crane to whom the Cognomen of Judge is attached, but being one of the Governor's puisne Judges, it is no evidence of either character, or capacity. Mr.
Allen sets out with a rapturous description of our “beloved Governor”
charges me and my “man Wyatt” with arranging a plan of attack
&c., all of which I deny. Mr. Allen has chosen to call in question my motives in an alledged combination against his “beloved Governor,” and if I were disposed to return the compliment I might say that he was the same person who was appointed to select the lands for the Seminary of learning, by the Governor, and in whose favour a Resolution was passed, making an illegal and unauthorized appropriation of two sections of land worth ten thousand dollars from those reserved for education, which a subsequent Legislative Council annulled—of Judge Crane; I have not a word to say further than to refer to the reports in the Treasury, in certain smuggling cases tried at Tallahassee a year or two since. It would be quite as charitable in me to ascribe the support of these individuals to the benefit they have received from the mal-administration of Governor Duval, as it is for them to accuse me of combination against their “beloved Governor.” Mr. Allen tells Judge White that the opposition is confined to dismissed officers and Northern men. The opinion of a large portion of the people of Florida, is that the support given to the Governor is in a great measure confined to those who hold his commission, 77 Hugh Lawson White, of Tenn.

have been benefitted by his favoritism, or are his creditors and endorsers who desire to retain him to indemnify themselves from the Treasury. I feel myself constrained to repel the idea so industriously circulated of the infamy of Mr. Wyatts character. It is due to myself as well as to him, as the object is to lessen the weight of my reputation by connecting me with a man represented as infamous.
Mr. Wyatt is an active political opponent who has always been heretofore against me, in local elections, and in the heat of the canvass I have spoken harshly of him. But I never knew any fact of his conduct that would justify his being denounced as infamous, and I
know he was supported for the Legislative Council by many of those whose interest it is now to abuse him. In his private relations he has the character of an honest man, his public conduct has been such as to secure him an election in the largest District of the Territory as long as he was a candidate, and he received more votes for Congress, in the county in which he (and Gov. Duval) lives, than Col.
Gadsden and myself together.
In intellect manners and education he is superior to the Governor.
His complaints cannot be disregarded upon any undefined imputation of infamy.
I have the honour now to inclose numerous memorials, and a new catalogue of charges, which I pray may be placed on file, and if they should not be deemed sufficient to prevent the appointment of the Governor, or to induce an investigation, they shall be supported by proof before the meeting of the Senate.”
I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant.
JOSEPH M. WHITE.

<place-time>WASHINGTON 13th March 1831</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. The claim of John Forbes & C° to a large tract of country situated between the Chocktawhatchy and Appalachicola Rivers in Florida, having been rejected, and no appeal having been taken within the time prescribed by law, the decree of the Court below has become final, and the land covered by the claim, is now subject to the disposition of the Government.
It presents a front of more than one hundred miles on the Sea Coast and extends in debth more than sixty miles. A part of this land is very productive, and is settling with great rapidity. The
-"

position of this tract on the map will impress you with the importance of having it surveyed and brought in to market as early as practicable.
In the Eastern part of the Territory I would respectfully suggest the propriety of extending the surveys down the Peninsula as far as the Indian boundary. You will perceive from the treaty with the Florida Indians that they are located on the Peninsula, with a reservation to the Government of all the land on the Seaboard for the distance of fifteen miles, both on the Gulf and the Atlantic border.
Some of these lands are said to be valuable both on account of the fertility of the soil and the Live Oak forests with which they are covered. On the Western Margin there are two excellent Ports the Bay of Tampa, and Charlotte Harbour, at beth each of which settlements have been formed. The latter is a place of rendevous for the Spanish fisher men of Cuba, who keep up a regular intercourse between that place and Havanna. It is important that the lands along the margin of the Gulph should be disposed of as early as possible. But far the present it would be perhaps most prudent merely to have the country run off in townships, by which means the character of the lands would be developed and wherever they may be found sufficiently valuable to warrant the expense they can afterwards be divided in to sections and sold.

<docbody>SIR. The duties I engaged to perform in the two cases of John Forbes & C° and Arredondo & Son lately depending in the Superior Court of Florida have been performed.
Having already rec" the compensation stipulated in our agreement you will perhaps think it improper in me to ask any thing in addition, but an explanation of the causes which induces me to do so, will I
think offer a sufficient justification.
Colin Mitchel & others who sued to establish the claim of John

Forbes & C° East of the Appalachicola River included in that suit the claim of Panton Leslie & C° for a still larger tract of land, the grant to which presented many principles different from that involved in the grant to John Forbes & C° and the two cases thus united gave me almost as much trouble as though they formed two different actions. The printed Record in the case containing 736 pages will give you some idea of the labour I performed in the Court below.
The case of John Forbes & C° West of the Appalachicola was argued at Pensacola. I was compelled to go there to attend to it at the most unpleasant season of the year. It cost me two months absence from home, and an expenditure equal to one half the compensation I
rec" for the service. My success was such as to put the case finally to rest, no appeal having been taken from the decision below. Under these circumstances I think I should be allowed an additional sum of $500.
My stage fair and travelling expences in coming to this place and returning home will amount to $225 which I think should be allowed me, as I came contrary to my own judgment, and under the special instructions of the Government.
The case of Robinson & another against the Register and Receiver at Tallahassee was argued twice by me before Judge Woodward who granted the Mandamus, and twice before the Court of Appeals in Florida. There are besides ten or twelve cases below which await the decision of this, most of which I argued below. The government having paid Col Allen for a part of those services I shall charge but
$150 for mine.
Should you approve of the several charges I have made you will please give the necessary orders for their payment, as I am desirious to leave this early the next week.

you will in compliance thereto proceed to Aspalaga on that river as soon as practicable, and make such arrangements for continuing the operations as in your judgement may seem most proper, in order that they may be completed at an early period. The sum available for the object is $8000. appropriated at the last session of Congress, * and such balances of former appropriations as are yet unexpended in the hands of the former Agents—You are not, however, to extend your engagements beyond the means now avilable to meet them.

<source>[NA:SF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:C]</source>
<place-time>(Copy) WASHINGTON 11. April 1831.</place-time>
<docbody>TO GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON President of the U States, SIR, With great respect I submit the enclosed documents for your examination.” I beg you will have the goodness to peruse them, and

you will find the strongest testimonials from every County in East Florida, of the just and faithful manner, in which I have uniformly discharged my official duties, and of the favorable estimation in which I am held throughout the District.”
You will also find, that those who most unjustly complained against me in 1829, have become sensible that they were wrong, and now disavow all cause of complaint, or express their regret that they made it."—and I am much mistaken or your generous feelings will be roused to something like indignation, when you perceive from these documents, the impositions practised, and even the attempt at bribery, in getting up the memorial against me.
I thank God, that subsequently better feelings prevailed, and that a sense of truth, or the force of public sentiment in East Florida, has compelled the memorialists to retrace their steps, or at least to desist from the course of injustice attempted against me.
I will detain you Sir, no longer than to say, that since the dismissal of their complaint by the Judiciary Committee, in addition to what was then before them, (in my justification) there have been filed in the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, as the antidote to the poison, numerous documents and testimonials, derived not only from the most respectable disinterested sources, but from the declarations, even from the mouths of the complainants themselves, completely contradicting, or justifying me, as to every alleged accusation or implication contained in their complaint—and proving too, the entire, I may say, at this time, the undivided and unequivocal approbation bestowed upon me, and upon my official conduct, by the whole people of East Florida.
I have only submitted copies of some few of these documents, being unwilling to trouble you with more. If they do away unfavorable impressions—if they prove to you, that I merit your good opinion, I
shall indeed be thankful—and I cannot but beleive Sir, that to your benevolent mind, it will be a pleasure to learn, that I have been misrepresented—and to find one, who even from his childhood has been an ardent though an humble friend to his Country—who has rejoiced in the glory that your deeds have shed upon her fame, and who, from his very heart, has ever been a supporter of all her Republican institutions, not unworthy of your approbation.
I have Sir with sincere respect truly yours, JOSEPH L. SMITH, [Endorsed] Copy of a letter from Judge Smith to the President sent to him in April 1831—with proof that the complainants against him

in 1829–had since without exception disowned, disavowed or retracted their complaint—
WASHINGTON 31. Jany 1832
Note—I fear that General Jackson, has not condescended to read this letter, nor the documents sent with it—otherwise it is impossible, that his mind, governed by just principles, and open to the influences of truth and evidence, should not have exonerated me from every unfavorable impression produced by a repudiated disowned and disproved complaint—nay, should not have esteemed and applauded ne.
Alas! in my case, that Falsehood, with Giant Stride, should have ready access to the Presidential Mansion, while humble Truth, limping slow behind, at last, when he does approach, finds each avenue closed against him.

The chiefs of the Seminolee nation, as I am informed by the agent have given their consent in writing that the school fund secured to the nation by treaty, may be applied to the education of such indian boys as the president may select either at the Indian academy

in Kentucky or at any other institution." It is desireable to learn the views of the Department of War on this subject, and whether I
am to proceed according to my instructions received last spring to send on to the Indian academy in Kentucky," four other boys during the present year—In the last year of the late administration, the amount necessary for this Superintendency was not transmitted for the last half year, I understood that the arreages for that half year had be estimated and asked for by the Secretary of War and that the same had been at the last session of congress meet by an appropriation—no remittance was made for the last half year of 1830. to meet the allowances and salerys of the offircers and persons employed at this superintendency—I trust that you will examine into the business—as the officers and persons employed are complaing of not having received their several allowances for the reasons as stated–I
received a letter of 3" Inst from the 2" auditors office,” informing that a Requisition N° 1504 had issued in my favour as Supt. of Indian affairs—I see it stated for the pay of Supt. & In" Agent. $750.
will be transmitted—This sum is due to the agent for the first six months of the present year and my allowance for the last six months of 1830 and the first six months of 1831—is not included. If their is no objection on the part of the Secretary of War, it would be rending me a service by transmitting the amount to me with such arrears as are now due to the other officers My private affairs demand my attention in Kentucky, and if the Secretary of War does not deem my services as required nessissary during the summer to meet the views and objects of the Government in executing such measures as the President may direct for the gradual removal of the Indians in this Territory, I shall leave this place about the last of June next, I will thank you to state this to the Secretary and my movements will be in accordance with his desire Respectfully Your Obt Sevt I am Respectfully Wm P.

SIR. The accompanying account for $208.75 in Favour of E. B
Gould Esq" you will notice is properly payable out of the appropriation for this Territory of 1830." It appears however by your Communications to the payees of some accounts recently certified by the Governor, that this appropriation has been expended and by the last appropriation law, it seems the sum appropriated in 1830 was insufficient to meet the expenses of 1829 which it was intended to pay, in as much as it is Stated in the last act that $248 of the amount then appropriated is arrearages." Whether this was to meet some particular account certified to the department before the law or whether it was predicated upon an estimate (including this account) made by the Governor. I do not possess certain information. If the latter be the Case this account can of course be paid without difficulty, and if not, should there be any excess of the appropriation of this year unexpended it is presumed it can be paid out of such excess, as far as it goes. If not or if the excess should be insufficient to pay the full amount, it will be necessary to provide for its payment in the appropriation of next Year.

<docbody>SIR, I beg to refer you to my letter of the 17* March last on the subject of funds for the payment of the several contracts then and previously forwarded."
The Deputy Surveyors have nearly all arrived from the woods and will make their returns before funds can reach me unless forwarded previous to the receipt of this. One of the Surveyors has overrun his contract upwards of three hundred dollars, to complete the payment

it will therefore require the sum of eight thousand & three hundred dollars, beyond what has been received.
I hope you will place me in possession of that amount as soon as possible, that I may be enabled to meet the demands against the office with accustomed promptness.
I have again to report the entire impracticability of having the fractional Surveys on the Escambia river completed owing to high waters which have been up for twelve months past, I again repeat that there are two Deputy Surveyors under standing orders to complete these Surveys with some others unfinished; whenever the waters shall recede so as to permit their execution.
I have not been favored with an answer to my letter of 21 Sept
1830." 22 Nov 1830” inclosing a Survey by Mr Whitehead of the Island of Key West, and stating his refusal to resurvey but a willingness to make out on a proper scale accompanied with field notes, and qualifying thereto, if such would be received, Until I receive your instructions on that subject, together with some necessary documents tending to shew the concession of that claim, I shall feel myself unable to proceed in the survey thereof.
From a minute examination it appears that the report of the Board of Commssioners for East Florida, for the year 1826,” have never been furnished this office, they are indispensible to the execution of my duties and hope you will have the goodness to have them sent.

Your Memorialists Citizens of the Town of Apalachicola in the Territory of Florida beg leave to State, that in Compliance with their petition, Congress passed a law at the last Session, appropriating, Eleven Thousand four Hundred Dollars for the erection of a light house at the West End of St George's Island. and Four Hundred Dollars, for placing Buoys in the Sound of St George.” In pursuance thereto, the fifth Auditor, directed the Collector of the Customs at St Marks, to locate Said light house & Buoys,” under the impression, that the duty, Could from his vicinity, be more conveniently performed by him than any other Collector on the gulf. This Error on the part of the fifth Auditor, was promptly corrected, he was informed by the Collector at Magnolia, that there was a Collector at Apalachicola, and of Course, the duty more properly belonged to him.” Notwithstanding these facts and circumstances, the fifth Auditor repeats his instructions and a Collector of an adjacent District who is an utter Stranger to the Coast and who has never visited the port of Apalachicola, is ordered on the important Duty of Locating our Light House and Buoys.”
Your Memorialists would therefore request that Capt Swiler of the revenue Cutter Pulaski, be ordered on this Service in Conjunction with the Collector of this District, who we are Satisfied possesses every information which the duty requires–

<source>[NA:GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee:ALS]</source>
<place-time>TALLAHASSEE 1* July 1831</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the circular of the Secretary of the Treasury under date of the 1" of May” which among other things provides that the Receivers shall be allowed as a compensation for their “expences and labour” twelve and a half cents per mile for every mile travelled from their respective offices to the Bank of deposit and returning. And for their “risk” in making such deposit the one hundredth part of one per cent on the amount for every ten miles of distance from the land office to the place of deposit by the nearest route. I am required to make my deposites at Mobile, when ever the Sum on hand shall exceed $10,000 and always at the end of three months however small the amount may be.
The distance to Mobile, by the nearest mail route is 407 miles. The
--"

per centage allowed on $10,000 is about $40 and the milage about
$101.75. Making the entire allowance for the “risk, labour and expences” in depositing $10,000, at Mobile is $141.75.
The Stage fare from this to Mobile and returning is $81.40. The Stage arrives and departs but once a week. The expences in travelling is about $2 per day, and it requires about 20 days to go and return. Making the expences alone including stage fare $121.40.
This deducted from $141.75 the whole amount allowed, leaves a balance of $20.35 as a compensation for the “risk” and “labour”.
The duties of the Receiver require his presence at his office, and it therefore becomes necessary for him to employ a carryer to make his deposits for him and a man who is worthy to be intrusted with
$10,000 can rarely be employed here to go to Mobile for less than five dollars per day, besides his expences. This for 20 days would amount to $100, which added to the travelling expences, and Stage fare would be $221.40. Thus the expences of every deposit would bring the Receiver in debt $80.25, a Sum nearly equal to his entire compensation for receiving, and becoming responsible for $10,000.
This Sir was certainly not the intention of Congress when it provided by the Act of the 22" of May 1826, that the Receiver should be allowed a reasonable compensation for the teet:ble “risk labour and expences” in making deposits of the public money.” It must be known to the department that there are no officers of the Government so badly compensated for their services as the Receivers of Public money. They are entitled to a salary of $500 per year, and a Commission of one per cent for the money expended or deposited by them. They furnish there own Clerks and Offices. My Clerk hire has never been less than the amount of my Salary. I have an office of my own, which saves me the expence of renting one, were it not for this I should be compelled to pay from fifteen to twenty dollars per month for one. The Act of Congress of the 22" of May
1826 was intended to increase the compensation of those officers and it has thiess vested in the Treasury department a descretionary power to give them what they may justly be entitled to receive for there Services. Believing that neither the Spirit or letter of the law has requires the restrictions imposed by the late regulations, I decline accepting the compensation provided. I shall rigidly observe those regulations so far as they relate to my duties in making deposits of the public money, and I shall expect hereafter to receive such reasonable compensation as the law has provided, for my expences risk and labour. The former allowance was truly in adiquate, but I prefer it to the present, as the additional per centage would enable me to

give a premium on drafts, to make my deposits, and thusly avoid the expence of employing a carryer, and paying his Stage fare and expences. I have taken the liberty of troubling you on this subject under the presumption that M* Ingham has left Washington, and that his Successor has not yet arrived.”

It will be seen from the above that the Inspectors of elections, with few exceptions, have transmitted to the Executive, either the Poll Book or a transcript from it. And why did they do this? Because they felt convinced that the law requires them so to do. No one can doubt but that they would have dispensed with it if they had thought that without it their returns would have been legal, and would be received by the Executive. This general concurrence of the Inspectors, shows the view taken of the law by them. In the cases where

the Poll Books was not returned, it no doubt proceeded from inattention, or from not having the law before them, when they made their returns.”

The Road has been repaired to within two miles of Black Creek a distance of twenty five miles from Jacksonville That portion of the Road between Black Creek and the Court-House has not been repaired, I estimate the distance at fifty-five miles and judge that
$2,000 will be sufficient to put it in suitable repair it passes over a more elevated section of country and will require less labour The Old Kings Road will no doubt be completed by the receipt of this letter I shall then have finished the duties assigned to me at this station and await your further instructions.

The undersigned, Citizens of Tallahassee, beg leave respectfully to represent to the President of the United States, the claims which they Concieve Maj. Romio Lewis has to the appointment of Marshal for the Middle District of Florida to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Maj Alexander Adair the late Marshall. Maj Lewis has discharged the duties of Sherriff of Leon County for the last five or Six years, and at the last election of Sherriff received almost a unanimous vote over his Competitor. When Maj" Adair received the appointment of Marshall of this district, he appointed Maj Lewis his deputy, who discharged the duties of the office untill Maj. Adair arived in the Territory, and Continued to discharge the duties as his Deputy untill his death, with general Satisfaction. We believe we are fully authorized to Say that the appointment of Maj Lewis Will be more acceptable to the people of the district than any other man—
as an Officer, he is Prompt, vigilent and efficient, and as a Man, responsible, worthy and highly esteemed by all Who know him—We therefore respectfully, but ernestly Solicit his appointment *

They earnestly request that an Engineer be sent for that purpose, as they have no confidence either in the capasity or responsability of the present Agent Mr Willis, they consider him unfit in evry respect for a trust of this kind, he is no engineer either in theory or practise.
It is more than twelve months since he has had this appointment and although a large amount of the appropriation (as we believe) has been expended, nothing effectual has been done toward effecting the objects thier is not the least probability of his succeeding in removing the obstructions, and we have reason to fear, that unless some competent Engineer be sent the money will all be expended for nothing.
It would be a gratification to know the amount of money already expended by the present Agent as we are apprehensive that a large amount has been squandered away.
We refer you to our Delegate Colo Joseph M. White who is personally acquainted with us, for the degree of credit to be plased in our statements, and would most anxiously request that no more of the appropriation be paid to the present Agent until an enquiry be mad, how, it is to be be expended."

<place-time>WASHINGTON Sept. 8, 1831</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Allow me to Submit for your consideration a brief Statement of facts relative to the conduct and capacity of Several public functionaries at Pensacola-
Of Mr. Wright the District Attorney I shall speak only as it regards his conduct in the trial of a Spaniard charged with the murder of Pearle, a Sailor belonging to the U. S. Ship Natchez, When earnestly Solicited to prosecute this trial he declined—rendering as an excuse that the accused was a Spaniard of considerable influence among the creoles—that he himself was a candidate for popular favour and he Should not prejudice himself in the estimation of the Spanish part of the population on account of a worthless Sailor.
Being threatened with a representation of his conduct at Washington, he reluctantly consented to Serve, but positively refused having any legal gentleman associated with him. At the trial a picked Jury appeared—consisting of eleven Spaniards and one American, and Six out of the twelve, were accomplices in the tragical affair which resulted in the death of Pearle. Mr. Wright was requested to challange Several of the Jury—he at first refused, but at length challenged one. In the course of the trial Mr. Wright So far from manifesting a becoming fidelity and activity in eliciting & arranging testimony calculated to cast light on the bloody affair, evinced a Supineness and indifference that filled every honest mind with amasement:-Indeed he virtually abandoned the case:-For the truth of this Severe declaration I refer to Judge Breckenridge who presided on the trial. Mr. Wright is regarded at Pensacola as a man

of feeble abilities, small legal attainments, and utterly incompetent even when rightly disposed to discharge in a becoming manner the duties of his Station as District attorney."
Mr. Caro of Pensacola is keeper of the Public Archives, and is also a civil Magistrate.—In this capacity he was called upon to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the Individual who has been identified as the murderer of Pearle. He refused, & when remonstrated with went to the proper Source and resigned his Magistracy—but after the trial was over he solicited & obtained again his office as Magistrate. His motives for this conduct may be found in the circumstance that he was at this time a candidate for the Mayoralty of Pensacola and taking any part in a process affecting the character of a Spaniard he apprehended might diminish his popularity with the creoles;—Whether Such a person is worthy of holding an office of trust and emolument under the general government is a question for others to decide.
Mr. Lareur"—the Post Master at Pensacola is a constant frequenter of a farro bank, where he has Suffered losses to Such amount that he is now generally regarded as a Bankrupt. He is Seldom seen at the Post office. He farms out this office to a young Spaniard who has but a very imperfect knowledge of the english language—who is negligent of his business, who is of a depraved moral character, who visits the farro bank, and who if public opinion may be quoted, was the murderer of Pearle. Mr. Lareur plead in excuse for neglecting the Post Office that he was appointed to it without his Solicitation, and that he cannot Submit to the confinement and drudgery of the office.
Every essential allegation contained in the preceding Statement, may be confirmed by reference to Judge Breckenridge, Col. Tutt, Robert Mitchell, Esq, of Pensacola, and by Com. Elliott and Capt Shubrick of the U. S. Navy.
Any explanations or corroborating testimony which the nature of this communication may require, will be at any time, most cheerfully rendered by Your truly respectful & Obedient Servant W COLTON

<docbody>SIR Sickness having prevented my making my proper report for last month, I avail myself of this, the earliest period of my strength to write after my recovery to apprise you of the operations of improving the navigation of the Apalachicola River that have been going On.”
I set a party of fifteen hands at work near the last of July excavating through the two lowest bends named to you in my proposed plan of operations; in which I changed the plan to cut three ditches ten feet wide & twenty five feet apart instead of the one wide channel first contemplated—This work was continued till the last of August when a most unusual rise of the river took place from the late heavy rains and prevented any further work of this kind. This rise of the river if it has stopt the work will test completely the experiment making—As yet the washings through the ditches have not answered my expectations, and by the time the river falls, if the experiment does not bid fairer for success than at present I shall think it advisable to abandon this part of the operations especially as the funds at command will not warrant the complete removing of the earth for a wide channel—On the 14" of August I fitted out a gang of fourteen hands with the Snag-boat accompanied by a house boat; which I had constructed at Brownville 25 miles above this place. The Snag-boat consists of two flats placed parallell to each other & eight feet apart with a wheel
& axle worked by a Capstain to work with a power of forty-tons.
This is found to answer all the purposes required. This party was continued till the 17" Ins" when from sickness and the difficulty of working on account of high water it was discharged They succeeded perfectly well in removing many very troublesome snags that had resisted all previous efforts to remove them and made considerable further improvements in clearing away a great number of stooping trees that were much in the way of Steam-boats. The moment the water will allow I shall have the boats at work again with the strongest force that can work to advantage, to complete if possible the improvements necessary to be made this Season.
If I should discontinue the work on the bends as above suggested there will probably be some portion of the money in my hands unexpended after I have done all that I deem necessary for the river: in which case I am requested to enquire of the Department by Isaac Brown a worthy citizen of this neighborhood & my overseer, if an account he has against the U.S. of $600, for which he performed a

contract with Judge Macomb former Agent for improving the Apalachicola river to clear out a portion of the river at the river of Sticks and which Macomb accepted but refused to pay Brown the money because he had none, can be paid by me.”
I shall soon forward my quarterly accounts for the present quarter With the greatest Respect your Obt Servt GEO W. LONG Lt Arty Eng Service GEN CHARLES GRATIOT Chief Engineer U S A.

They will, however, no doubt endeavour to make the president believe, that those opposed to them, in Florida, are all his enimies, and claim to them selves as they always have done, to be the only persons in Florida who are Jackson men, and who have Jackson influence Charles E.

<place-time>Magnolia FLORIDA 5th Oct. 1831</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In obedience to the instructions contained in your circular of the 24th of August last " and the establish" usage of the Engineer

Department, I now furnish a report of the opperations in the work of improveing the river and Harbour of St Marks for the past year ending on the 30th ultimo. At the commencement of that year the Opperations were confined to the improvement of the River from its mouth to its source, and were continued, until about the middle of November when the whole was completed. In the progress of those improvements no attempt was made to remove the “natural ob-
Structions” (refer" to in the Survey and report of David B Macomb Esqr.) laying in the bed of the river, but the opperations were directed wholy to the removal of the “casual or accidental” obstructions made by the falling of large trees into the middle of the river, and those whose bodies, limbs, and bows, overhung it so as in some places to be almost impassable. This portion of the work could only be done witheat by common labour and without the aid of Machinery and being of as much importance as any other part contemplated by the act makeing the appropriations, I thought it adviseable to progress with it towards completion in order that no part of the opperations might interrupt the improvements in the Harbour which it was then supposed would be commenced in the early part of the winter. The river from its mouth up to this place has been free" of all artificial obstructions to Schooner navigation and from this to its source Rock Haven has been improved for boat or scow navigation.
After the completion of this section, the force employ" was discharged except a small part which was retained for the purpose of procureing fuel for the Machine which was to opperate in the Harbour. Upon the conclusion of the Engineer Department to transfer the Machine which was then in use at Mobile p" to the work in the Harbour of St Marks my attention was directed to a correspondence with Leut Ogden in relation to its immediate shipment. Reflecting on the many engagements of that Gentleman I concluded that to insure expedition in geting the Machine to St. Marks, it would be better for me to go to Mobile point and attend personally to its Shipment and the engagement of an Engineer & Machinest. The Engineer Department were duly informed of my haveing adopted the course Just mentioned and of the delay, disapointment and confusion which attended the transfer of the Machine." Supposeing that the Machine would arrive at St. Marks (as I had arranged it before I left Mobile) on about the 20th to the 31 Jany. I on my return home commenced the procurement of timbers for the large flat in which the Machine is placed and for two releiveing lighters.
It would be proper for me here to observe that the flat and lighters

which had been connected with the Machine at Mobile point could not in any way be removed to St. Marks, unless at enormous expense and even then with an almost certainty of being lost at sea. Not being advised by either Leut. Ogden or M" M*Cartney (the Engineer and Machinest who had been sent back to Mobile point to attend to the Shipment of the Machine) of the particular pieces of timber required for the Machine flat and lighters I employ" a few hands to procure such only as I knew would be necessary expecting the information desired on this subject by every mail on the arrival of M"
M°Cartney about the middle or last of June from Mobile with the Machine, it was ascertained that the Machine flat and lighters were somewhat of different construction than I had supposed. requireing stronger timbers in every part. They have been procured and the Machine flat will in a few days be ready to receive the Machine.
The lighters are in that state of forwardness which will ensure their completion while we are puting up the Machine. In a few days the Dredgeing opperations will be in full motion If the past summer in this country had been an ordinary season the Dredgeing opperations would have been commenced from 4 to 6
weeks earlier. About the first of July the rainy season commenced and continued with scarcely a days intermission until the latter part of August. This it is supposed, caused the sickness which has prevailed through the country and which has deprived us of some of our most valued citizens. As an evidence of its extent it is estimated that five out of every seven of the white population of the Middle district of Florida have been afflicted with disease. Its influence I
have seriously felt in the work under my charge. I have not withstanding deem" it important to go on while a man could be found to strike a blow, in order that a full season in which such work can be Judiciously done may be allow" in the approaching fall and Winter for the removal of the obstructions in the Harbour.”
I am very Respectfully Your Obt. Sevt JESSE H WILLIS Agent, Eng" Dpt.

<place-time>Executive office, TALLAHASSEE, Florida, October 7th 1831.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, The communication from the State Department, of the 25th of August last, relating to the fisheries on the Coasts of Florida;" and requesting information as to the propriety of witholding or granting the accomodation applied for by the British Minister, in behalf of the inhabitants of the Bahamas, to catch fish and turtle on the Coasts of Florida, was received in due course of mail.
The terms of the application as gathered from the communication from the Department, would induce the impression, that the privilige

asked for was of minor importance, but such opinion, would be erro-
IleOuS.
It has been estimated that the fish and turtle, taken in the fisheries on the Coasts, and in the waters contiguous to the Islands and Keys of Florida, and sold in the Havanna and other places in Cuba, exceed one hundred thousand dollars annually. There are besides many sold and consumed in the United States, and elsewhere. There are a number of Wessels, generally smacks from twenty to fifty tons burthen, employed Solely in that business; and several persons pursue it, and also the employment of salvors, or wrecking, in the same vessels. Some years ago these fisheries were referred to by a gentleman" very competent to judge in this respect, in a report made to the Government, of an exploration of the Peninsula, as a topographical engineer; as one of the most valuable resources of the Country. More recently other intelligent gentlemen, who have taken an interest in the subject, and have made investigations to arrive at the value of these fisheries, and the practicability of their regulation by law for such purpose, have advanced the opinion, that they can be made the source of considerable revenue to our local Treasury. At the last Session of the Territorial legislature, the Judiciary Committee of the Council, were instructed to enquire into the subject, with that object; but for want of time to pay that attention to the subject, its importance demanded, it was deferred to the next session of the Council in January 1832. The law proposed by those who brought the subject forward, I am informed, required all persons taking fish &c with intent to carry them out of the territory, whether such persons were foreigners or not, and whether the fish were carried to foreign ports or not, to procure a permit for that purpose, and to pay an officer appointed by the Territorial authorities, a certain amount imposed as an equivalent for such privilige, and regulated by the quantity of fish carried away. It created a forfeiture of vessel and cargo, and an infliction of personal penalties, for its violation. It is expected that a similar law will be proposed at the approaching Session in January next, and will probably be enacted;
and application will also most probably be made to Congress, for aid in its enforcement; as otherwise, obstacles may arise, at first, to an effectual and complete execution of its provisions. If the general government should regard it as contrary to sound policy, as an unwarrantable assumption of power, as conflicting with the interests of the United States, or as interfering with its engagements to, or the spirit of courtesy proper to be observed towards the British Govern-

ment, as it is subject to the revision of Congress it can if advisable be abrogated before its enforcement is attempted.
The fish and turtle are chiefly (if not all) taken in the Sounds, bays &c on the Coasts, and in the waters contiguous to and between the Islands and Keys, and in shoal waters; and as it believed will be admitted, entirely within the local jurisdiction. It is contended by some of those of our citizens, who have interested themselves in this subject, that the right of piscary in these waters is wholly local, and belongs exclusively and solely to the citizens of Florida. This exclusive claim, is founded upon their inhabitancy of the country to which these fisheries naturally and geographically appertain. They are not sufficiently beyond the local jurisdiction as to render them of the national character, of the mackarel, cod, and whale fisheries, and to place them under the control and protection of the National government.
It is also urged, that if the general government, have control over this right of piscary, it is owing to our situation at this time (being only a Territory) and that when we become a state, this right, and the entire regulation of these fisheries, will revert to the State government, as appurtenant to the local or state sovereignty. There are also those, who deny any authority in Congress, even at this time, to interfere with these fisheries, except in the revision, (as prescribed in our
“Organic Act,”) of our Territorial laws.
It is not considered necessary or proper on this occasion, to offer arguments to shew whether all or any of these views, of the rights of the general government, and of the People of Florida, are false or sound:—they can be as properly and justly weighed without the very humble aid I could render. The most entire confidence is reposed, that no measure compromitting the rights or interests of our citizens, beyond what it is their duty as good citizens cheerfully to acquiesce in; nor any course tending to fetter the State government, which it is trusted is soon to be organized in Florida; will be pursued by those now entrusted with the administration of the National government.
It would seem that the British Minister is under the impression, that the inhabitants of the Bahamas, enjoyed the accomodation asked for, before the cession of the Floridas to the United States, and until the British West India Islands were closed to the commerce of the United States, and that the accomodation was refused to be continued, in consequence of this restriction upon our commerce.
That no persons of any nation were prevented from fishing within the waters of Florida before the cession; and also from doing many other things, since prohibited by our laws, is correct. The extension

of the favor of fishing as then enjoyed by strangers, did not conflict with the interests of the Spanish population of Florida. The number of Floridians then employed in the fisheries, was compared to the number now engaged, quite limited. In fact as those employed in the business supplied S" Augustine, and Pensacola, and other Spanish towns, among which, were as at present, the Havanna &
Matanzas, inducements to favor them, rather than otherwise existed with the Spanish authorities. The Spanish population of Florida, for years previous to the cession, did not equal one eighth of the present number of its inhabitants. It was confined chiefly to the cities of St Augustine and Pensacola, and their vicinity. If they had been disposed not to permit, they had not the power to prevent, the use of these fisheries by strangers.
Soon after the cession and before the West India ports were closed to the U. S. and as the population of Florida increased, especially down the Peninsula and on its coasts, and on the Islands and Keys, these fisheries were found to be highly valuable, and in some respects necessary, for the use of the Inhabitants of the Country, especially those near the Sea Coast.
The Seminole Nation of Indians, who use many of these fish, were also about this time, removed to the Peninsula; and confined by treaty to it. The policy and laws of the United States, and of the Territory, required, that no foreigners should have those opportunities of association with them, which the use of those fisheries, and the consequent frequenting of our Coasts permitted.
Difficulties occurred between residents of the Bahamas, who visited our Coasts in vessels under the pretext of fishing, but really to carry on the employment of Salvors, and our citizens engaged in the same pursuit, and in consequence of the improper conduct of the former, in a variety of ways, and among others in taking vessels across the gulf stream, into Nassau, and other places for the adjudication of salvage for services rendered on our Coasts, and in our waters, and jurisdiction; the latter resolved to force all foreigners to forsake those fisheries, and also the wrecking business on our Coasts.
No violence was it is believed, committed, but they coalesced, and avoided all amicable association with the foreigners,—refused to furnish provisions, or aid them in any manner,-threw every possible obstacle in their way, -enforced rigorously the revenue laws of the U. S. relating to foreign vessels in our waters, and also the laws regulating intercourse with the Indians, and adopted many other expedients extremely vexatious to those against whom they operated. After sometime, in consequence of the conduct of the wreckers from the Bahamas, the Act of the 3rd of March 1825, entitled “An

act concerning wrecks on the Coasts of Florida,” was passed by Congress.”
No officer had authority or instructions from,-nor was any person incited, aided, or countenanced by either the National or Territorial government, in driving the fishermen & wreckers of the Bahamas, from our Coasts, except such assistance as was afforded by the legal prosecutions in our Courts, authorized by the Acts of Congress above noticed, and which acts it should be observed were mere local, municipal, regulations, that all foreigners coming within our jurisdiction, and especially those using these priviliges, were bound not to infringe.
Indeed the privilige asked for, has never been denied the Inhabitants of the Bahamas, by our Government, nor has any legislation been had with a view to such effect, either by Congress or the Territorial legislature.
The measures of our fishermen and wreckers, and the enactment of the last mentioned Act of Congress, and the alluring prospects for settlement in our Territory, induced many who wished to continue or embark in the business of fishing and wrecking, to become residents of Florida, and citizens of the United States; and among them were several Inhabitants of the Bahamas. All this was anterior to the closing of the West India Ports to our commerce. But to prove that the obstacles thrown in the way of the Bahamians, fishing on our Coasts, by our fishermen and wreckers, was not induced by any feelings arising from that measure of the British Government, it is only necessary to state: that the regulation closing the West India ports, was highly advantageous to the citizens of Florida. We had no trade that it could affect injuriously. Standing in most respects to the Northern and Western States as do the British West India Islands—purchasing the same products and disposing in return of the same articles, the closing of the ports by shutting up their markets as to the United States, made our purchases more plentiful and cheaper, and by decreasing the importations from those Islands, enhanced the demand for, and the price of our products. Besides much of the Capital, and many persons who had been employed in the West India trade, but who in consequence were forced into other employments, were induced to emigrate to our Territory, and to seek out, and put into action the latent resources of our new, and theen comparatively unknown country. It is therefore repeated, that the course pursued towards the Inhabitants of the Bahamas, by individuals & which in some measures operated to prevent their enjoyment of these fisheries, was not in any wise in retaliation for, or owing to the closing of the West India Ports, and that their own improper abuse of this privilige provoked

such course. If however the measures pursued by our fishermen and wreckers (without the encouragement and not at the instance of the Government,) had not been effectual, it is probable, that the ascertainment, upon the settlement and improvement of the country since, that these fisheries were valuable and that the interests of the inhabitants required the exclusive use of them to be retained for them alone, would have induced measures by the Territorial, if not by the national government, with that object in view.
The considerations existing against granting the extension asked for previously, have not lost their force, by the recent arrangement between the two two governments, opening the West India ports to American Commerce.
Although the limits assigned the Seminoles by the Treaty," do not extend to within fifteen miles of the sea, it has been found necessary, to suffer them to visit the Coasts and obtain fish. The practice cannot be discontinued without exposing them to great suffering. Upon the extension of the favor asked for, it would be next to impossible to prevent association between them and the foreign fishermen, and such intercourse would inevitably lead to infractions of the laws of the United States in regard to trading with them,--would be destructive of all government over the Indians, and might lead to the most danger-
Ous consequences.
Checks, and restraints, and facilities for detection, apprehension, and punishment, exist with regard to our citizens, who may violate the revenue laws of the United States, and other laws of the general and territorial governments, that could not be imposed upon non resident foreigners, approaching our Coasts in Wessels. Indeed such opportunities for smuggling especially, would be afforded to foreigners by the extension of this privilige, that it could not be prevented.
If the privilige was granted, it is feared also, it would again be used as a pretext to enable interferance, and competition with our citizens in the business of wrecking; and would lead to collisions, and disputes, and difficulties, and engender feelings, calculated to disturb the harmony, which between two nations having the same origin, laws, and language, should be preserved as a matter not merely of reciprocal interest, but of mutual pride.
If the President however, should conceive the National Government possesses the power, and that either courtesy to the British Government, or the interests of our own, renders an express grant or extension of the privilige asked for, proper or advisable; it is trusted, that it will be granted only, with conditions, that will render those who use the fisheries, amenable to such laws as may be enacted for the regula-

tion of these fisheries, and liable for such equivalent, as may be imposed upon them, equally with all others, for such liberty, by our Territorial legislature.

Mr Blair has been for some time acting as a deputy of his father in law and is now in the discharge of the duties of the Marshalsea, he is a gentleman of Strict

integrity and his appointment to the office of Marshal of this District which I take the liberty hereby to reccommend, would tend to alleviate the sufferings of a worthy and interesting family and be highly gratifying to a very large portion of the people of the District, which deeply sympathises with it in its afflictions. please do me the favour to make the contents of this letter known to the President together with assurances of my high respect and consideration.

<docbody>To the Hon Senate & House of Representatives of the U States Pear Sir, I have recently addressed a note to the Postmaster General” in relation to the inconveniences & privations we labor under from want of regular & certain mail communications. Under existing circumstances, it will, unquestionably, be less expensive for Government & most convenient for all concerned that our mailroute should be via Tampa Bay. True, there is not yet a Postoffice at Tampa; but I learn from Capt. Saunders (sutler at that post.)
that the establishment of one soon is expected. Two light packetboats employed between this port & Tampa would give us a mail every week—& what is nearly as consequential, periodical & certain means of transmission to any & all parts of the continent.—In discussing this business, two important matters should be brought into the consideration—intercourse with our squadron on the West Indias, & if an interchange of mails with the Spanish Postoffice should be negtiated, intercourse direct with the island of Cuba.
Such a state of things would very soon produce funds sufficient to defray the expences of the proposed route.

There is another matter of some consequence to me & to those who reside on this island, in which I beg your agency—a suitable site
& building for a Postoffice. The lot on which the Custom House buildings stand is owned by the proprietors of the island, & will eventually, I imagine, be purchased by the General Government.
This lot is well situated, & sufficiently large to contain all the buildings that now are or which may hereafter become necessary for both Custom House & Post Office. In the mean time, the buildings now on the lot & belonging to the U. S. are sufficiently capacious & conveniently arranged to accommodate both the Collector & Postmaster;
& all that is wanted to effect the object required is an order from the Treasury Department conveying to the Postoffice Department jurisdiction over or right to occupy a portion of the buildings. Dr.
Lacy will be able to inform you of the dimensions, localities, divisions, &c. of these buildings.
You will do me a great favor to transmit per mail a copy of all important reports & other documents relating to this portion of the country.
The Governor's proclamation for holding an extra election for Delegate to Congress was rec’d here in season, but no extra election has been held. The excitement, at least in this district, had passed off;
& the good people were slowly but surely coming to their senses.
Suffer me to repeat a suggestion made some time since, that a visit from you to this place, (your actual presence here), would do more to remove doubts, dissipate prejudices, & silence lying tongues, than all other means combined.
Most truly, Your &c.

I have understood that an individual in this District was engaged in building two vessels from the live oak growing on New River but whether the timber has been cut from the public land or is private property has not yet been ascertained. A few days since, I communicated with Capt. Piercy" of the schooner Spark who has proceeded to New River in consequence, and on his return to this place he will report to me fully on the subject. I shall then further communicate Sir to you what measures will have been adopted on the occasion.

<place-time>APALACHICOLA RIVER Near Ft Gadsden Novr 1 1831</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I herewith enclose my monthly report for the month of October–
The Stage of the water was such as to allow me to commence the operation of improving the navigation of the river about the first of the month. The Boats were accordingly furnished with the force stated in the Report and proceeded to complete the work in that part of the river called the narrows.
The work engaged in consists in removing the Snags & logs in the bed of the river, breaking such rafts of drift wood as may be collected clearing the way for it to pass freely and clearing the falling-in banks of the river of such timber as will be liable to fall in it & injure its navigation. The narrows extending about 50 miles above Ft Gadsden has been the most difficult part of the river for boats; nearly the whole of this, as far as I can see, is now as open & easy for navigation as it can be made without an expense far beyond what would be practicable to Straighten it at the places I had at first proposed to do—
The work through the narrows is so far finished that it will be completed by the middle of November when the boats will ascend the river and work at all places requiring to be improved to the forks of the Flint & Chatahootchie rivers. This will occupy till about the middle of December when I shall wait your further instructions With the highest Respect Your very Obt Servt GEO W.

ACTING GOVERNOR WESTCOTT TO THOMAS L. SMITH
[FSL: Fla., Gov. Exec. Corr.: M*1]
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE Nov 6th 1831–
SIR, When Governor Duval left the Territory some days since he requested me to answer your letter to him of the 12th of September last requesting estimates for the year 1832 as early as possible.
Serious indisposition has prevented me hitherto from performing that duty. In relation to the Indian appropriations for Florida I have no information except that gathered from the laws as I have never had any concern with the Indian accounts: I presume they should be the same as for the last year. The last civil appropriation made for this Territory was by the Act approved March 2nd 1831 Chap 55 Acts 2nd Ses 21st Cong.” The appropriation in that law “for compensation and mileage of the members of the Legislative Council, pay of officers
& servants of the Council fuel stationary printing and distribution of the laws was $7640 including $248 for arrearges. This appropriation of $7640 was insufficient to pay the expenses of 1831. Adam Gordon has an outstanding account for publication of the laws of $155 which is yet unpaid " and E. B. Gould has informed me his certified account for same service was not fully paid at the Treasury and that a balance of $13 was left in arrear. The new appropriation should cover these amounts which with an appropriation of $7500 will be sufficient although new furniture will have to be purchased by the Council for the coming Session, and an additional expense incurred.
The contingent fund for the Territory should be $350. as heretofore.
The last Legislative Council applied for an appropriation from Congress of $1500 for printing a compilation of the laws absolutely necessary to the people of Florida." Col: White the Delegate has the papers upon this subject to whom I beg reference may be made and I
also enclose a copy of the laws & resolution of the Council on the subject vide pages 38 & 96 of book enclosed; as the publication will now

embrace the laws of the coming Session the appropriation should be increased to $2000 to insure the completion of the work.

<place-time>ASPALAGA November 15" 1831</place-time>
<docbody>SIR Your letter directing me to investigate & report the particular facts of Browns claim has been duely received "—
I have enquired into the case and find the following material circumstances of it capable of being proved—
Sometime in the summer of 1829 Brown entered into contract with Macomb to clear the river of its obstructions at the river Sticks and widen it 100 feet, by cutting off a point of land that projected into the new channel that was forming, for which Macomb was to pay him
$600. This contract was witnessed by Judge Brackenridge while in company with Col. White at Macombs house. This paper was left with Macomb, who now says that it is lost. It appears also that Brown can prove that he proceeded to fulfill the contract without delay on his part and in the same season widened the channel 150
feet and completed his contract in other respects except the removing of one log which he could not obtain force enough to draw ashore.
The following season however he succeeded in removing the log and finishing the contract on his part as he understood it and as Macomb had stated repeatedly, that when the log was removed he should be entirely satisfied with the work and that the money would be ready for him Brown has never been able to obtain any money for the work he performed or even any settlement with him whatever-
These are the facts on which the claim is founded, which I furnish you without waiting the proof of them on account of the short space of time previous to finishing the operations under my charge & my

expectations of being ordered elsewhere. I shall forward the evidence I may obtain of the matter as soon as it can be obtained"—

<place-time>WASHINGTON, Nov 16, 1831.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, My acquaintance with Mr Tho" Eston Randolph, lately appointed marshal of the middle district of Florida,” dated no further back than the year 1818, on my return to Virginia; since which, to the time of his removal to Florida, I have known him as one of the most esteemed citizens and magistrates of the county of Albemarle. Not knowing, therefore, from what circumstances the idea could have arisen of his being “an unnaturalized foreigner,” I have enquired of Mrs Randolph, my mother-in-law; who has given me the following details.
Mr T. E. Randolph's father, one of the sons of William Randolph of Dungeonett on James River, was a native Virginian, and brother of the mother of Thomas Jefferson. He went to England before the revolution, and settled as a merchant at Bristol, where T. E. R. was born. This gentleman came to Virginia about forty years ago;
inherited the Dungeonett Estate, through his father, and married a daughter of Col° Thomas Mann Randolph of Tuckahoe. He has never been out of the country since.
I will only add, without the remotest intention to reflect on those by whom they may be urged, that any ether ebjeetions my conviction that any other objections against this appointment would on enquiry prove as ill grounded as that which has elicited this communication.

<docbody>HONBLE. EDWARD LIVINGSTON, Secretary of State, SIR. I had the honour, by the preceding mail, to acknowledge the receipt of the commission" appointing me United States Attorney for the Western District of Florida, and to notify the Department of my acceptance of the same.
The commission was not received in time to enable me to attend the courts in Escambia and Walton Counties, and I have not yet had time so to arrange my business here as to permit my immediate removal into the district. I shall be able to attend the other two counties, Washington and Jackson. The death of Col. James A.
Dunlap has vacated that place in this district and I would be happy, if it comports with the views of the Department, to be exchanged into this district. I have notwithstanding readily and with pleasure given my name to a paper recommending my friend, M. Leslie A.
Thompson for the situation, first informing him that I should seek to be exchanged.”
With great respect, I have the honor to be, Yr. mo. obt. servt.

<docbody>SIR I herewith enclose my monthly report of the operations of improving the navigation of the Apalachicola river for the month of NOV 1831.14
The force employed on the river has been continued in that part of it called the narrows, in removing the rafts and clearing the banks where the heavy timber was liable to be washed into its channel.
In removing the rafts it was found necessary to go over with the work once or twice to clear them effectually as by removing the upper logs & snags a few days was found sufficient for the sand to wash from the bottom ones which would then rise to the surface & require to be removed. This part of the river I now consider as well improved
& cleared of obstructions as is at all practicable. The channel has no obstructions for any craft that may navigate it.
The boats are now about 50 miles below the forks of the Chatahouchee & Flint rivers working upwards. This part of the river is quite free from logs or Snags and will require not more than 15 or
20 days work which will complete the improvements of the river agreeable to my views of it " With the greatest Respect Your Obt Servt GEO W. LONG Lt Arts Engineer Duty GEN'C GRATIOT Chief Engineer US Army

“Floridian’ & I learn an effort will be made to have it transfered to a vulgar, blackguard paper called the “Courier”—This last gazette was purchased to Serve the purposes of a local faction, & was designed to be supported on the patronage of the govement—It has already Sunk for the want of funds, & I learn that two whole numbers have not been printed in two months—
The Floridian is better edited & printed, has a much more extensive Circulation & will do the work in a neater and better manner. The Courier is devoted to vilification with a limited circulation & is without exception the most blackguard paper in the Union The local faction in Florida represent every Press & person who does not support them as apposed to the administration—I enclose you some of the numbers of the Floridian to refute such a charge I am with great respect you mo obst JOS M WHITE

The communications with Key West, from this and the other Departments are sometimes of an important nature, and are now made by a very circuitous and dilatory route—A mail by the way of Mobile will always reach that place in a fortnight—I, therefore, think it very desirable that the proposed arrangement should take effect."—

<source>[NA:SF, 22 Cong., 1 sess:C]</source>
<place-time>[Referred December 12, 1831]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.—
Your Memorialists respectfully shew to your honorable body that they have associated themselves together and have become incorporated by the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida *
by the name of The Planters and Citizens Company for the purpose of constructing a Canal from the waters of Matanzas River at Mala Compra in the County of St: Johns to Smith's Creek a water of Halifax river in Musquito County.”
That the said Canal must necessarily pass over a considerable tract of Country owned by the United States, to obtain a grant of which is the object of this Memorial.
The Lands thus asked for consist of wet Savannas and pine-barren of very little value in their present state, but by draining the Savanna may be rendered good tillable land and the pine timber on the rest will be necessary in the construction of the Canal, So far as Private Property is embraced in the route which is about Three and a half miles, the Proprietors have cheerfully ceded it to the Company, and your Memorialists have ventured to hope that the Congress of a great Nation will not refuse so far to encourage the industrious exertions of the Citizens in making public improvements as to furnish their share of the foundation on which these improvements are to be made, especially when it is shewn that the Canal when cut will open to the Planters one hundred miles distant from St. Augustine a ready market for their produce and to obtain in return, the articles necessary for their plantations for which at this time they are obliged to resort to Charleston Three hundred miles distant at an enormous expense and great risk. The Public lands also situate on the extensive waters of the Halifax and Hillsborough rivers will be encreased

in value in the same proportion with private property a value far superior to that of the lands asked by your Memorialists.
And your Memorialists further shew that the Canal proposed to be made is part of that internal navigation formerly proposed by the Government to be made along the Eastern Coast to the Florida Keys an improvement that in times of Peace will unite the interests and greatly facilitate the intercourse between our Citizens, and in time of War will render easy and safe the transportation of Troops and the Munitions of an Army.
Your Memorialists therefore pray that your honorable body will please to grant to them the Public Lands extending one half mile on each side of the said projected Canal from the lands of Doctor Peter Porcher at Byke Plantation to the lands of Mr John Bulow on Smith’s Creek a distance of about Six Miles.
And Your Memorialists will ever Pray—

<docbody>SIR. I am fully aware of the rule of the different Departments of the Goverment not to furnish copies of Complaints against public officers
& am also fully sensible of the propriety of that rule in its general application, but there no doubt has, and may continue to occur circumstances which would permit a deviation from it. I am of opinion that those circumstances now exist with regard to the petitions against me headed and forwarded by the Messers Hamlens to the Eng" Dpt.”

Although your letter of the 16th Ulto.” with the enclosed reply to the first memorial of those gentlemen which I had the satisfaction to receive by the last mail assures me that no want of confidence has been created by that effort, I am not entirely satisfied that their second with all the influence which may be attach" to it, will not make an impression against me. My anxiety therefore it may be emagined is great. Hereafter I may have occasion to use the papers refer" to &
must therefore ask for copies of them which I hope will be sent to me without delay. They are now matters of public record and under all the circumstances in which I am at present placed are assential to me.”

$n Congress Assembled The Memorial of the Undersigned Citizens of Gadsden & Lion Counties, Middle Florida Respectfully represent—
That they are situated in a beautiful & fertile part of the Territory, well adapted to the Cultivation of Sugar, and that the said section of Country is intersected by two bold streams, called Ocklockny and Little River, the navigation of which may with a reasonable expendi-

ture be so improved as greatly to facilitate the transportation of our produce to market, particularly the article of Sugar, the cultivation of which must be abandoned by us until we are enabled to convey it by Water to our sea ports—
We therefore respectfully solicit an appropriation to assist us in clearing out these Rivers—
Your Memorialists could multiply topics to urge a compliance with their request, by they forbear; cherishing a confidence that Congress will not be insensible to the claims of a large population in this particular section of the Territory, to share in some degree in those aids that have been, and still continue to be so bountifully dispensed from the public funds East & west of us –
From Such estimates as we have been enabled to make the Sum of Fifteen thousand dollars would afford the relief prayed for by your Memorialists—

<docbody>SIR, In reply to the enquiry of M" Chandler the District Attorney of South Florida," as to the proper mode of proceeding against offenders, under the act of Congress of March 2, 1831 ch. 65 entitled
“An act to provide for the punishment of offences committed in cutting, destroying or removing live oak & other timber or trees reserved for naval purposes—” * I have the honor to state that the proceeding by indictment appears to be the only proper one to punish the offences embraced by the first section of the law and the same mode would I have no doubt be a correct one to recover the penalty
“not exceeding one thousand dollars” mentioned in the second section—If a ship has become forfeited under the 2" section, the proceeding by Information against the ship would be the usual and advisable form.—The words in the third section are as M* Chandler suggests calculated to create some ambiguity.—
But in all prosecutions against an offender in order to inflict on him a fine or any other punishment for an offence committed by him, I hold that the proceeding by indictment is the one most consonant to our institutions & the principles of our government—and therefore that it is the legitimate and proper mode in every case unless a different one is specifically pointed out by the Statute I am Sir very respectfully Yr. ob"S"

<dochead>PRESENTMENTS OF THE GRAND JURY OF JACKSON COUNTY</dochead>
<source>[NA:SD, Misc. Letters: Pr."]</source>
<place-time>[December, 1831]</place-time>
<docbody>Presentments of the Grand Jury of Jackson County, West Florida, at the December Term 1831. With the Charge of the Honorable H.
M. Brackenridge, Published at the instance of the Grand Jurors of Jackson and Washington Counties.
The Grand Jurors for the County of Jackson, in the performance of their duties as a Grand inquest of said County, present as oppressive, the Fee Bill of the officers of the Territory generally, but particularly those relating to Justices Courts, and respectfully reccommend the Council to have them amended and reduced to similar rates of the adjacent States, also to confine the jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace in like manner, and confine Justices and Constables in civil business to their districts, without milage to the latter. They would farther recommend that jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace extend to 100 dol., and that the County Court have concurrent jurisdiction with the Superior Court in civil cases.
In taking leave of the Court, we beg leave to present to his Honor, Judge Brackinredge, our thanks, for his very able and luminous charge addressed to this body, on their being empanelled, and his conduct so highly satisfactory on the Bench.
The several matters contained in his charge, and animadverted on by his Honor, are certainly of the highest importance to the community, most especially that which relates to the uncertainty of the law; it is indeed a grievance to every well organized community, that the laws should be so uncertain, that not only the common citizen, but those learned in the science, cannot determine what the law is—
we would therefore present this uncertainty, as a grievance, and request that our representation, will use their exertions to remedy the evil. We respectfully request of his Honor, that he will permit his charge, in pamphlet form, or otherwise, to be printed, accompanying these presentments.
The Grand Jury take much pleasure in presenting their thanks, to the District Attorney, John K. Campbell, Esqr., for his prompt attention to their calls upon him for information, during the session of the Court.

Joseph H. Russ, GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY:
The oath you have taken, comprises an epitome of your duties.
A part of it may appear to require of you, something more than the accusations against individuals for violations of the criminal laws of the Territory, and it is not unusual for Grand Juries, to enquire into grievances of a public nature, where the law has provided no particular remedy. It is also customary for them, to express their sentiments on various subjects, in which the public welfare is concerned.
Such presentments, (if they may be so called) however tending to the advancement of good morals, in general, and of the prosperity of the community, furnish nothing upon which the Court can proceed to act, in its judicial capacity. The Court, therefore, can only consider the Grand Jury as a component part, and a most important one, in the administration of criminal justice. Topics of morality, expediency, or policy, should properly be referred to others, who are disposed, and whose duty it may be, to enlighten their fellow-citizens.
It must be admitted, however, that there are subjects of a general nature, where the expression of the opinion, of the highly respectable individuals who compose the Grand Jury, may be attended with very salutary effects, but this must be left to their own good sense and discretion. There are some subjects which properly belong to the duties of the Grand Jury, although no specific offence be presented; such for instance, as the situation of the public prisons, and others connected with the administration of justice.
The proper province of the Grand Jury, is that of an accusing tribunal; for according to our institutions, no man can be put upon his trial on a criminal charge, without the sanction of such a body of men, selected from among the inhabitants of the county, where the offence is supposed to have been committed, and acting under the solemnity of an oath. That oath, forbids all accusation from motives of malice, envy or hatred; and at the same time, enjoins the accusation of those, who have offended against the criminal laws, without regard to fear, favor, affection, or reward. In all communities of civilized men, this is one of the most important duties of government. The weak must be protected; the lawless and violent, must be restrained.
On this the peace of society, as well as the security of the individual

depends. Although all human institutions are imperfect, I am yet satisfied that nothing better was ever contrived to accomplish this great object, than the introduction of Grand Juries. This institution, is one, whose origin cannot easily be traced; it is peculiar to this country, and to the soil of our British ancestors; it is esteemed and justly valued, by those enlightened nations which do not enjoy its benefits; it is one of those happy productions, whose seed, like those of some of the noblest plants of the earth, must be referred to the giver of every good and perfect gift. By this institution the punishment of crimes is made the immediate duty of the community itself.
In those countries, whose government is denominated despotic, or even where they have emerged from that state, to badly regulated liberty, we may witness the dreadful effects of unpunished crimes or oppressed innocence, where accusation is altogether prompted by individual feelings, or where it is left to the Magistrate, who is to pronounce upon the guilt or innocence of the accused, without the previous interposition, or sanction of a council of disinterested citizens, of weight and character. Where in a word, they have no Grand Jury—a body, which with us may be justly styled, the terror of the guilty, and the shield of the innocent, although according to our laws, another must interpose before final conviction or acquittal. In the countries to which I have alluded, crimes may be committed with impunity by the great and powerful; the poor and humble, dare not complain, because they can seldom hope to prevail, and might be made to feel the consequences of their temerity. How different would this be, if the accusation were to proceed from such a body, as that which I now address? In such countries where the great are the accusers, and the unprotected the accused, the latter must either be crushed, or compelled to endure a cruel and remediless oppression.
It was this which gave rise to the relation of client and patron among the Romans; and among modern nations; it has compelled the common people, to submit to a slavish dependence on some lord of the soil, who claims an exclusive right to oppress.
The Grand Jury should bear in mind, that by them only, can offenders be brought to justice, through the medium of a trial for the alledged offence. It is therefore their duty, to sanction the accusation, where the evidence furnishes areasonable ground to believe, that an offence has been committed by the accused. It is not absolutely necessary, that that evidence should amount to positive proof of guilt, for the Grand Jury hear only the evidence on the side of the prosecution. As far as it goes, however, it ought to be satisfactory;
it ought to be credible, and free from contradiction. It may be a serious thing to put a man upon his trial, to compel him to undergo its attendant mortification, and vexations, even when sustained by

conscious innocence, and the confident hope of an acquittal, on a full and public trial, before an upright and impartial jury of his country.
Although I have thought it unnecessary to enlarge upon the obligations of your oath, as Grand Jurors, as this should, in some measure, form a part of the education of every American freeman, who aspires to be properly instructed in his rights, and duties; yet, as it is the province of the court, to explain and expound the laws, I will detain you with some remarks, on those enacted by the Legislative Council of this Territory, for the purpose of punishing offences.
Nothing can be more obviously important, in a community like ours, governed by laws, than a general diffusion of a knowledge of their enactments: for it is a maxim of the criminal law, that ignorance excuses no man. Perhaps there cannot be found in history, a stronger instance of tyrannical and oppressive government, or one more proverbially cited, than that of Caligula, who wrote his laws on Tablets in a character so fine, and suspended them on pillars at such a height, that no one could read them, and then inflicted the punishments they denounced, against those who violated them. The Legislative Council of this Territory, it must be acknowledged, had an arduous task to perform. In the different states of the Union, from which you have migrated to this country, they had the advantage of the settled code of Great Britain, and this, when altered and modified by the cautious hand of enlightened men, with the aid of experience, has enabled them to establish something better suited to their circumstances, and situations, without incurring the danger of uncertainty, obscurity and confusion. The alterations might be made from time to time, on an established system, as they were dictated by necessity. This Territory, haveing been obtained by the United States, through a treaty with a foreign nation, whose government was of a despotic character, it became necessary to establish institutions entirely new. The inhabitants of Florida, did not like those of the Carolinas or Georgia, bring their laws and institutions with them;
but from their habits and predilections, in this newly settled country, it was natural for them to look for models to those laws, and institutions, under which they had enjoyed liberty, prosperity and happiness.
But the difficulty of selection has been such, as to give rise to a censure, perhaps too just, that the criminal laws of this Territory, have not been free from uncertainty and doubt. “Unhappy the subject of that country,” says an elegant writer, “where the laws are vague and uncertain.” The error with us has probably arisen in some measure, from the varying, and unsteady character of our legislation; the frequent repeal, or modification of our criminal laws, by which, a

fixed and certain knowledge of them by the People, has been rendered almost impossible. It is not my wish, or my intention, to case a censure upon the Legislative bodies of Florida; their motives were doubtless good; but in a mistaken desire of improvement, they have forgotten, that, certainty as to what the law is, may be of more importance than even an improved modification.
The first acts of the Legislative Council were passed in the summer of 1822, one year after the acquisition of the Territory. I was a member of that body, by commission from the President of the United States, but was appointed to my present situation, before the commencement of its session. Foreseeing, however, the difficulty under which the Territory would labor for the want of a suitable code of laws, I had procured a volume of the digested Legislative acts of Missouri, which had been similarly situated, having been also a province of Spain. The Territory of Orleans, now the State of Louisiana, continued to be governed in civil matters by Spanish laws; the greater part of its inhabitants, having been accustomed to them, and estates being held subject to its rules. Missouri, on the contrary, was settled by citizens of the United States, habituated to English and American Legislation. The volume to which I have alluded, was the result of fifteen years experience in that State, and yet contained for the greater part, little more than the adaptation of the joint labours of Jefferson, Wythe and Madison, and of some of the Pennsylvania Legislators, to the circumstances of the country. The act adopting the common and statute law of England, prior to the 4th of July 1776,” was among the few which can be called original. Our first Council, received this volume as their text book, and adopted the greater part of it, with little or no alteration. The next Council of 1823, for what cause it is difficult to say, thought proper to repeal the whole of them at once, instead of making such alterations, or amendments, as they might have deemed necessary. Our Territory, has ever since experienced the pernicious effect of this example. The whole body of the law criminal as well as civil, not even excepting the fundamental act which adopted the common and statute law of England, has since been repeatedly repealed, and re-enacted, and partial alterations have been made, by which they have been rendered vague and uncertain, instead of being permanent and generally known. The criminal law, which of all others ought to have been fixed, has been marked by the same mutable character. Every succeeding year presented us with a new code, which was repealed before the people had time to become acquainted with it; reminding one of the web of Penelope, who undid at night, what she had woven in the day time.

The last statute of the Territory providing for the punishment of crimes and misdemeanors, was passed in 1828;* all acts prior to that period were expunged from the statute books. It was hoped that in future, we should look to this statute only, for our direction in the administration of the criminal law. But it was soon observed, that a most important omission had been made, in the enumeration of acts to be in force, by the condensation act as it is styled, of the same Council; all others being repealed. The act to which I allude, was that before spoken of, adopting the common and statute law of England. In the act of 1829," this omission is supplied, by the act adopting those laws, which are of a general, and not a local nature, down to the 4th of July 1776—with certain exceptions, thereafter enumerated; these are, 1st, that the said Statutes, and common law, be not inconsistent, with the Constitution and laws of the United States, and the acts of the Legislative Council of this Territory:
2d—that none of the British Statutes, respecting crimes and misdemeanors, shall be in force in this Territory, excepting Statutes declaratory of and in aid of the Common law; 3d—Nor shall any person be punished, by the said common law, when there is an existing provision on the subject, by the Statutes of the Territory; but when there is no such provision, then, the several Courts of the Territory, shall proceed to punish such offence, by fine and imprisonment, the fine not to exceed five hundred dollars, nor the imprisonment twelve months. At the same session an amendatory Statute was passed, and which with that of 1828, and two other acts of the same Council, (1829) to prevent dueling,” and to regulate interest," may now be considered, as constituting our criminal code. The last Council, appears to have been fully sensible of the error of their predecessors, and have refrained from any serious alterations.
According to the Organic Law of Congress," exclusive jurisdiction in all capital cases, is given to the Superior Courts; and by the act of 1828, establishing County Courts," all criminal jurisdiction is withdrawn from those Courts, with one exception, specified in the act, and rested in the Superior Court. This Court also, takes Cognizance of offences against the Laws of the United States, and against the Laws of Nations; such as robbery of the Mails, Piracy, and other offences, of which jurisdiction is given to the Courts of the United

States; and it is, also, your duty to enquire of, and present such offences.
By the act adopting the Common Law of England, it appears that none of the British statutes, on the subject of crimes and misdemeanors, are in force in this Territory, except such as are declaratory, and in aid of the Common Law; it appears further, that no part of the Common Law INCONSISTENT with the acts of the Council, is adopted; and again, that Common Law PUNISHMENTS, are in no instance to be inflicted; but inlieu of them, where our own Laws are silent, a discretionary power is given to the Court, to punish by fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, and imprisonment, not exceeding twelve months; so much of the Common Law therefore, on the subject of crimes and misdemeanors, as is not thus excluded, is still in force here.
The act of 1828, appears to have been intended as a complete criminal code, and is therefore not confined to fixing the punishments of offences merely, but has attempted to supplant the Common Law writers and Judges, in the definitions, and descriptions of them, and in the explanations of their various constituents, together with the circumstances which serve to mitigate, excuse, or justify. This was not attempted by the Laws of Missouri, and perhaps more wisely.
Language being imperfect, it is impossible even for the greatest masters of it, entirely to avoid uncertainty and ambiguity. The definitions of the Common Law, are the preductions of ages of experience, and every term, is so explicitly understood, as to leave but few questions to be settled. In a new code, many questions must arise; a circumstance, which militates against that certainty so necessary in criminal jurisprudence. Many of the very terms used by the Council, require explanation, and for this we must have recource to the writers on the Common Law. The greater part of the definitions contained in the code we have enacted, have been, it is true, almost literally borrowed, or copied from that Law, and I incline to the opinion, that it would have been more advisable, for the present, to have referred the whole to that source. By pursuing this plan, some of the puzzling, and perplexing abstractions, to be seen in our code, and some of its dangerous novelties might have been avoided.
It is not my intention, to enter upon a critical examination of the Statute, to which I have just referred. This would require a volume;
for as I have already observed, it professes to cover the whole ground of Penal Law; but I feel disposed, by way of illustrating the remarks I have made, to cast a glance on a portion of this important Statute.
for this purpose, I will select the 6th, 7th, and 8th sections. Whether these are original with us, or suggested by the lucubrations of some

enlightened individual, I know not; but I am not satisfied, that they afford any improvement of the Common Law, although at first view, they may appear more consonant to natural reason and justice.
According to that Law, drunkenness, is no excuse for crime under any circumstances; from sound policy, it is reguarded as an aggravation of the offence. But according to the sixth section, just referred to, a person in a state of intoxication, may commit the highest offence known to the Law, with impunity, provided such intoxication has been occasioned by the fraud or artifice of another! It is impossible for any one to foresee the consequences of opening such a door to the contrivances of human depravity. The 7th section, is liable to a still more serious objection. By this it is provided, that a person committing a crime, or misdemeanor, against another, may be excused in showing that he himself has been threatened by a third person, in case he refused its perpetration; and on making this proof, the jury are required to find a verdict against that third person, who may be no party to the indictment! Thus John Styles, is indicted for a murder committed on Samuel Stokes; on this John Styles proves that one Richard Roe menaced him with death or mayhem, unless he perpetrated the said murder, and that in consequence of said threats he did the act, of which he is charged. The traverse Jury acquit the actual perpetrator, of the crime, and convict the person who procured it to the committed by threats and menaces; and on motion in arrest of judgment, the Court will be certain to discharge him. The 8th section contains a provision similar to the foregoing, in favor of a Slave, committing a crime under the coercion of his master, and is liable to the same objections. The Common Law has sufficiently provided for these cases, by making the instigators, accessories or principals; and where there are mitigating circumstances in favor of the actual perpetrator, they are the proper subjects of Executive clemency.
As the act of 1828, and that of 1829, will be taken by you to your room and may be referred to, I shall not trouble you with any further remarks respecting them, unless specially required to do so on your part.
There are some other subjects, of miscellaneous character, to which I will now call your attention. There are several acts of the Council, which, it is made the duty of the Court, to give you specially in charge.
The act to prevent duelling," provides that any person challenging another, or the acceptor or bearer of a challenge, such person, or persons, shall be incapable of holding any office of trust, or profit, in this Territory. The second section, declares it to be murder, in the

party killing his antagonist in a duel, or inflicting such a wound, as to cause his death, within three months; and his aiders, abettors and counsellors, incur the same punishment, which is death. The 3d and
4th sections, are intended to put a stop to those violent affrays, and public quarrels, which are so apt to terminate in duels. The person assaulting another, with dangerous weapons, whose use is likely to produce death, is declared guilty of felony, and is to be punished with a fine not less than 500, nor more than 1000 dollars, and imprisonment, not less than two, nor more than five years; and a person assaulting another with a stick, cane, or whip, or other weapon, used for ignominious chastisement, his aiders, abetors, and counsellors, to be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, and imprisonment, at the discretion of the Court, not exceeding two years. The 7th and last section of this act, contains a provision of a somewhat questionable character, it is that, which subjects persons fighting a duel out of the Territory, to the same punishment, as if the act had been done in its jurisdiction, provided the duel had been planned, and set on foot, within it. It may be time enough, to examine this subject, when a case shall occur to render that duty necessary.
At the same session, 1829, an act was passed to regulate interest,"
in which it is declared, it shall be the duty of the Grand Jury, “to present all and every person, who may violate its provisions, that may come within their knowledge, and on every such presentment, it shall be the duty of the District Attorney, to have issue joined, or made upon such presentment, and prosecute the same, under the rules and regulations, prescribed for the prosecution of Qui Tam actions.” "
I must remark on this section of the Law, that the person who drew it, could have had but an imperfect idea of a Qui Tam action, of the official duties of the District Attorney, and of those of the Grand Jury; or of the distinction between civil, and criminal proceedings.
Usury is not an indictable offence at common Law, nor is it made so by the Statutes of the Territory; the subject, therefore, does not properly belong to your duties—another section of the same Law, provides that a Qui Tam action may be brought by any person, in the nature of an action of debt, for the penalty imposed by the Law.
How it is possible to make the presentment of the Grand Jury, the foundation of a civil suit, according to the course of judicial proceedings, could be more easily explained by the framers of the Law, than by the Court.
By the 7th section of the act concerning Roads, Highways, and
30 Nov. 21, 1829, Fla., Acts, 1829, pp. 108–111. 51A statutory action brought by an informer to recover a penalty for infraction of the law.
446774–59-40

Ferries,” overseers of Roads are subjected to a fine of ten dollars, for the neglect of the duties prescribed in that section; which sum is to be recovered, by warrant from under the hand and seal, of a Justice of the Peace, in the County. The latter part of this section imposes some duty upon the Grand Jury, but it is expressed in very imperfect language. It provides, “that it shall be the duty of the Grand Jury of the County, from time, to time, to make presentments, or prefer indictments to their Superior Courts, of such Roads, as they shall find out of repair.” That is, the Roads are to be indicted! How these Roards are to be punished, is not declared; if by riding over them, it is the traveller who suffers. It is not declared that the overseer, or any other person, shall be subject to indictment for neglecting to repair them. This is probably nothing more than a careless inaccuracy of language; but in a degree scarcely inferior to the case of a County Solicitor, in a State not fair distant, who indicted a Bridge, for an assault and battery committed upon a Horse, who unfortunately fell thro' it.
An Act past at the last Session of the Legislative Council, makes it the duty of the several prosecuting Attorneys in this Territory, before presenting Bills of indictment to the Grand Jury, to require a prosecutor, whose name shall be endorsed on the back of the indictment.—
This act seemed at first, to present such a serious obstacle, as almost to defeat the administration of criminal justice, especially in the higher offences. It might have been judicious, to have left it with the Grand Jury to require a prosecutor, to be responsible for costs, where in their opinion, the prosecution was frivolous. In some of the States, in cases of assault and battery, and minor offences, where the party aggrieved, is more seriously interested, than the community at large, it has been deemed expedient, to require a prosecutor. But in no State, as far as I am acquainted, has a prosecutor been required, in cases of murder, robbery, arson, and others, of a nature, where the safety of society itself, demands thier punishment. According to the Law just referred to, it would seem at first blush, that no indictment could be found, no matter what might be the nature of the effence, unless some individual presented himself as the public accuser; and which few persons are willing to do. The consequence might have been a failure of justice; but considering that an indictment, presented by the prosecuting Attorney, was only a mode of bringing forward the

accusation, which might also originate with the Grand Jury, themselves, I have narrowed the construction of this Law, to its letter.
I have, therefore, uniformly directed the Grand Jury, when no one was willing to endorse his name upon the indictment, to return a presentment in form, which may be drawn up by the District Attorney, at their request, and signed by him, after being returned into Court.
There is a subject of no little delicacy, to which I deem it my duty to call your attention. During the last summer, very serious alarm has prevailed throughout the greater part of the Southern States;
and although I hope greatly exaggerated, yet sufficient to cause deep reflection. This community has not been entirely exempt, and the same causes exist here. Our Legislation upon this subject, has probably made sufficient provision; but, there is still room for much to be done, in the vigilant execution of the Laws. There is perhaps, still more to be done, by the prudence and precaution of the individuals, who are interested. The cause of humanity requires it, as well to themselves and their families, as to the Slave who may be deluded, to his own certain destruction. Without increasing the rigor and severity, inseparable from a state of servitude, the dangers which attend it, may be averted, by timely vigilance and attention. The circulation of inflammitory publications, which have been thrown into the Southern Country, by incendiaries, actuated by fanatic zeal, which knows not the mischief it occasions, cannot be too severely reprobated. The public assemblages of Slaves, in unusual numbers, for whatever purpose, ought to be discouraged, as it affords them an opportunity to commune with each other, and to form a mistaken idea of their strength. The unrestrained association of free People of Color, among the Slaves, ought to be discountenanced.
GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY; in conclusion, I will again remind you of the nature of the high and important duties, you are called upon to perform. Chosen from among the most distinguished of your County, for intelligence, respectability, and wealth you may be reguarded, as placed at the very foundation of social order. There can be nothing more delightful, in the sight of God and man, than a well governed, and well regulated community. Where violence and crimes are repressed; where peace dwells in its borders, and where SAFETY TO PERSON, PROPERTY, AND REPUTATION, ARE SECURED TO ITS
INHABITANTS. FINIS.

Your Petitioners present the trade of this Bay commenced in 1825, & in 1827 the imports coastwise exceeded 35.000$, at the same time, the Exports upward Eight Hundred bales cotton, besides quantities of skins & furs—Since 1827, on account of not having direct foreign trade, the business declined—at this time ’tis improving, there being three resident merchants on the Bay—
The trade of this bay we assume had it been a Port of Entry, would at this time have Exceeded 200.000$ per Ann. saving to the Planters on the articles of Salt & Coffee (in Freight Commissions, insurance, interest &c) ef more than 25 per cent—A direct trade with the West india island, would give the planter facilities for shipping Cattle, Beef, Pork Lard & Lumber which cannot now be done but at an enormous coastwise freight—Your Petitioners take the liberty to State the Expence to Government could not be much increased, as the port is now a port of Delivery at an Expence of 900$ pr Ann:

<docbody>SIR I have now the honour to report the progress of the work under my charge (the removal of obstructions in the river and harbour of St Marks) for the month ending yesterday. In my last monthly report I stated to the Eng" Dpt. that the dredging opperations had not commenced,” On the 8th of Dcbr we had so far completed the machinery and flats as to allow their removal to the obstructions in the harbour. Beleiveing the improvement of the
“Devils Elbow” the most critical and difficult part of the work
(which I thought had better be undertaken by Lieut Long when he arrived although I had full confidence in the success of my on plan

to improve this point) I commenced the opperations at the first obstructions above. The Machine has been found defective in its construction although the plan of it is good. It has scarcely power enough, and many of its parts too slender. but by attending promptly to its wants we are enabled to keep it in motion and in time hope to get it in complete order. Up to the time mentioned above, we have removed 220 cubic yards of mud and shells. I thought it adviseable not to complete the 2nd relieveing lighter. The short distance which the mud is carried and the quickness of its discharge will fully employ the machine to keep one in motion. The timbers are ready for the second should it be required ”

were appointed a Committee to carry the same into effect—
J W SIMONTON Secretary F. A. BROWNE Chairman To the Hon: Senate & House of Representatives of the U States In behalf of the Citizens of Monroe County, and as their Committee appointed for that purpose, we beg leave to make known to you their wants and wishes in relation to the establishment, of certain and regular mail communication with the main land Much the greater part of this County consists of Islands, scattered in various groups and clusters, from Cape Florida to the Dry Tortugas The principal port and business place is Key-West.—Here reside the Officers, and here are held the sittings of the Superior Court, and Court of Admiralty, for the Southern Judicial District of the Territory.—
It is a Military Post—and the Custom House of the District is located here.
We consider that these establishments alone are of sufficient consequence to the General Government, to call for the institution of a Mail route to this place We are aware that correspondence per mail between the Departments and the Agents and Officers in their employ does not generally speaking increace the revenue of the Post Office—
But we are equally aware, that the Nature and Spirit of our Government, not only justifies but demands, the carrying into effect, of any and all measures by which will be increased the welfare of the whole—
The Committee learn by enquiring of the Officers and Agents of the General Government now residing here, that no communication of any kind from Washington, has reached one of them in the three Months last preceding.
We do not pretend to estimate the injury sustained by the Government,in consequence of this tardiness of communication, but we are confident that no Officer or Agent, thus situated, can discharge his duties profitably for the Government or satisfactorily to himself.—
The great increase of population, and the rapid augmentation and great importance of Shipping and commercial transactions in this section of the country fully warrants us, in asking of the General

Government, the establishment of periodical and frequent mail communication At no place in the United States, is so large an amount of property annually brought in, and submitted to legal adjudication and disposal as in this The rights and interests, especially of shippers, Owners, and Underwriters, would be materially increased and advanced by the arrangement asked for.
The protection and encouragement of commerce has ever been considered by this Nation, as a matter of the highest moment.— We fully concur in the opinion. And in asking the benefits of fixed and frequent Mail intercourse, we only ask to share equally with our fellow Citizens, in proportion to the interests we have at stake.—
Prospectively, much might be said in favor of our request— We hope that the time is not far distant when an interchange of Mails between the American and Spanish Post Offices will be negotiated Whenever this is effected, Key West, will almost as a matter of course form a part in the channel of communication.—
We believe that eventually this port, will become the general rendezvous and depot for the United States squadron on duty, in the West Indies, and Gulf of Mexico.—
But independent of this consideration no other place within the Jurisdiction of the United States, offers equal facilities for ready and speedy communication with our West India squadron, on an average, a vessel sent from any of the usual stations, on the Northern side of Cuba to Pensacola (now the point of communication) is absent six weeks, whereas from the nearest of those stations, intercourse with Key West, would under ordinary circumstances be completed in forty eight hours; from the most remote, in less than five days. In the existing state of things, we often suffer great inconveniances, from the want of certain and direct intercourse, with Tallahassee, the seat of Territorial Government.
Laws are enacted, promulgated, and in operation over fourteen fiftenths of the Territory, long before the inhabitants of this County, are even aware of their existance.—
Orders affecting our rights and interests, are issued by the functionaries of the General and Territorial Governments of which we are totally ignorant, until the time of benefiting by the privilidges offered, or avoiding the evils threatened has past by-
It would doubtless be most for our conveniance to receive our mails via Tallahassee. -
And we arrive at this conclusion more readily from having learned that the Citizens of Tallahassee intend making an application to

receive theirs by a branch from the great Mail route between Millidgewille an New Orleans O. O'HARA

To the President of the United States.
SIR—The undersigned Citizens of Pensacola and the County of Escambia in the Territory of Florida, having understood that it was the intention of His Excellency William P. Duval to resign the office of Governor of our Territory, beg leave most respectfully to nominate Col. James Gadsden as his successor, and to state that they are persuaded the best interest of Florida would be promoted by his appointment. The undersigned are aware, that it has been the custom to appoint the Governors of the Territories from some one of the States. This custom they cannot approve in principle or practice. A Governor who has resided with the people from the earliest settlement of the Territory, whose mind is not warped by

party prejudice, certainly understands their interests better than one coming among them a perfect stranger.
The appointment of Col.
Gadsden, we cannot but believe, will be hailed with pleasure by the people of Florida generally. We are respectfully your obedient Servants.

<docbody>To the honorable James D Westcott Jun Secretary and acting Governor of the Territory of Florida The petition of the Subscribers Citizens of Jefferson County respectfully sheweth, That your petitioners have and likely to suffer great losses and inconvenience from the Indians roaming at large within their precinct, contrary to an act of the Legislative Council entitled “An Act to prevent Indians from roaming at large through the Territory,” passed the 15" January 1827 and approved January
20* 1827." Your petitioners would shew to your honor, that a large body of Indians are now on, or near the Aucilla encampted without any possible means of subsistance, unless by destroying the game of the Country, and pillaging from the Inhabitants thereof. That they have already commenced their ravages among the stock owned by your petitioners and in the open day, are your petitioners compelled to witness the distruction of the small pittance they possess to support their families in these hard times. Your petitioners are not disposed to act before consulting with the proper authorities of the Land.
Tho: the law clothes them with power, they are not disposed to use it, before taking good counsel, They look to you to see the laws carried into execution, and are desirous that it should be done without trouble or bloodshed. They therefore pray your honor to take the subject under consideration, and forthwith to have these Indians removed

from our limits and that hereafter, they be compelled to resign within the bounds assigned them by the Government of the United States.
Your petitioners before closing would respectfully shew to your honor that the presence of the Indians amongst them opens a door for the slave population to carry on a system of depredation which unless stopped must inevitably lead to the impoverishment of your petitioners, render the country unsafe, and not only the property but the lives of your petitioners will be in continual jeopardy Light Townsen Wm ROWell John A.

upon the subject of the then next coming Elections—Maj.

White for Congress: he replied it is not possible, you will vote in that way, M. Redderow? and on M* Redderows answering, that he thought well of those Gentlemen, & should therefore support them; Maj. Phagan said, with much warmarth;
then you need not go to my Agency; for I will be damned, if I will have any man there, who does not support Gadsden and Dell!

Phagan, upon the subject of the wanderings of the Indians from their territory among the whites—upon which occasion, I asked him whether there was any chance of redress for their disturbing the property of the whites:
I stated to him that they were often hunting amongst my cattle &
as I had reason to believe—occasionally killing one—and asked him whether there was not some way to remedy the evil? He in a very abrupt and apparently angry manner replied, “No Sir! but If the people had voted as I wished them to, and elected Co Gadsden, we could have had a fine troop of Horse-men stationed in the County to scour the country & keep the Indians in Check” Surprised by his language & indignant at the sentiments it conveyed I said with some warmth: Has it then come to that Maj. Phagan, that the people are not to expect protection, or what is necessary to their security
& interest because they prefer Col. White to Co Gadsden? Maj"
Phagan replied in an embarrassed manner “No Sir, no Sir, I didn’t mean that, exactly, but if Col. Gadsden was in Congress I could ask him for whatever I wished! but from Col White I will ask nothing”
disgusted & dissatisfied with what appeared to me a most gross insult to the people and an evident attempt to violate the elective franchise
& controul the freedom of elections, I broke off the conversation, &
quitted the Maj”

(Copy.—) Territory of Florida, MONROE CoUNTY
[Referred January 23, 1832]
To the Honorable the Senate and House, Representatives in Congress assembled:—
The memorial of Theodore Owens would respectfully represent, that under and by virtue of a late act of your hon" body” your memorialist was deputed by the Marshal of the Southern Judicial District of the Territory of Florida, to take the census of the Inhabitants comprising said District.—A very sparce population is to be found in said District, which extends from Indian river inlet to Charlotte's Harbour including the islands of Indian Key, Key West and the Dry-Tortugas and innumerable little islands on the Florida Reef.—
In the discharge of this duty it became necessary and your memorialist did employ a small schooner and two hands and was engaged sixtyone days in the performance; having to perform a journey of near fourteen hundred miles in the said schooner and in an open sea to execute and perform the duty committed to his trust—Your memorialist would further state that the compensation allowed him by law is only sixty-two dollars and four cents a sum totally inadequate to the expense of the vessel and hands employed by your memorialist.—
Your memorialist believes the actual expense, the risk which he run, (having to perform the duty during the sickly summer months) and the value of time while employed are worth, in addition the sum allowed Three hundred dollars; and he therefore prays that your honorable body will grant to him such compensation as is just and proper."—

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to enclose to you a letter of George Center of East Florida, covering charges against the Indian Agent John Phagan—I have been notified in various private letters of many of the facts charged, and have reason to believe that they can, & will be maintained if an opportunity is afforded of having them investigated—
I solemnly believe that the history of no nation, or Country can furnish a paralel of the fraud, oppression and inhumanity to which the Florida Indians have been subjected—A part of them are now endeavoring to hire an Interpreter to come at their own expence, & lay their complaints before the President—These miserable people are now reduced to the utmost extremeties for the neessaries of life, indeed they have been in penury & wretchedness for years, & many have perished from starvation—This is brought upon them by combinations to decoy them into intoxication, the more effectually to cheat and defraud them out of their property, & to paralize their efforts to make a support so that new appropriations may be asked only to be wasted—If you will order the agent and all this subordinate agents out of the Nation, & send a Commissioner to treat with them I am confident they will go west of the Mississippi, & become incorporated with the Creeks—If this course is not persued I will make an effort in Congress to get a law providing for their removal"—

SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 23rd instant,” with the accompanying papers containing charges against Major Phagan, the Indian Agent in Florida. The course indicated in my letter of yesterday will be pursued in relation to these papers.”
I have understood from the President, that he has already mentioned to you his willingness to treat with the Florida Indians, for the relinquishment of their present reservations, and for their removal to the Country West of the Mississippi, whenever there is a probability, that a negotiation for those objects would be successful, as he is indisposed to encounter the previous necessary expense, without an intimation of this nature.” He has also so stated to Major Phagan, with the view, that the latter might make inquiry immediately, and report the result—If you have any information upon the subject, I
should be happy to receive it, and should it hold out a reasonable prospect of success, measures shall be taken without delay, to effect the removal of the Indians.

my commission has been forwarded to the Judge of the Superior Court for this District, to be delivered over to me when I shall have given the Official Bond required by law.—Shortly after the receipt of your former notification of my appointment, Oct. 27" 1831,”
I was requested by a communication from the Comptroller of the Treasury to furnish that Office with an Authenticated Transcript of my Official Bond. I was then with the court on its circuit at a distance from this place, I however immediately forwarded to that Office a copy of my Bonds together with their approval by the Judge, certified by the Clerk of the Superior Court for Duval County.—
But as the Marshals Bonds have usually been filed in the Clerks Office at this place, I have, since my return, caused correct Transcripts of my Bonds and their approval by the Judge, to be made out and certified by the Clerk of the Superior Court at this place, under the seal of said Court, the originals being filed in his Office, which Transcripts I have also forwarded to the Comptrollers Office, and presume they have been received some time since.—My Commission from your Department inclosed to Judge Smith bearing dated in October,” has been handed over to me, the conditions expressed in your instructions to him having been complied with—The Commission * of which you have done me the honor to notify me by the last Mail has not yet reached his Office "—I was under the impression that the Bonds into which I have already entered were sufficient without being renewed, as the penalty expressed therein is obligatory upon me and my security] during my continuance in office as Marshal.
If however I am mistaken, and it is necessary I should renew the Bonds under the second Commission, I beg that I may be so advised; suggesting at the same time that the Judge of this District is absent on business at the North, and as the law requires his approval of such Bonds, the time at which I may be enabled to forward them, depends necessarily upon his return.—I must plead as an apology for being thus particular, my solicitude to comply with all that may be required of me by the Government—

There are individuals here who offer to deliver any articles of provisions &c (at one doll prbbl advance on the N York price) at the mouth of the Ocklawaha river on the St Johns from whence they it might be transported at a small expense by water within two miles of Camp King in case the troops are employed in transporting the Sanne.

At a meeting of the Citizens of Alachua County East Florida held at Micanopy on the 23" day of January 1832.
BONAPARTE TOSCAN Eso" Chairman R RUSSELL WALDRON Secretary The Object of the meeting having been stated the following Preamble & resolutions were considered & unanimously adopted Whereas it having been ascertained that there are exceeding 1600
Warriors & over 1100 Slaves (belonging to the Indians) now residing in the Seminole Indian Nation many of whom are traversing the County adjoining the Northern Boundary of the Indian Nation and

it having been estimated that there are a larger proportion of slaves than white persons owned by the citizens of said county residing within
30 miles of said Northern Boundary, and Whereas an armed force is deemed requisite to protect the Citizens of said County from aggressions by the Indians or attempts of an insurrection among the slaves, in which case no assistance could readily be obtained from the two Companies stationed at Cantonment Brooke Tampa Bay owing th there being 112 miles distant from said Northern Boundary &100 miles distant from the Seminole Agency Therefore Be it Resolved that a Committee of three be appointed to draft a Memorial to the President of the United States respectfully requesting him to direct that a Company of U. S. Troops be ordered from Cantonment Brooke or some other station to Camp King near the Seminole Indian Agency.”
Resolved That the Chairman & Secretary be requested to forward copies of these resolutions to the Honorable Lewis Cass Secretary of War communicating to him also the present situation of the Barracks at Camp King & the facilities of transporting provisions to the troops by the Ocklawaha River.
Resolved That copies of these resolutions be forwarded to the Governor of the Territory & our Delegate in Congress requesting them to use their exertions in effecting the object of the foregoing resolutions.

To the President of the United States The Subscribers Citizens of Alachua County Respectfully Represent That the present situation of the County & its inhabitants induce them to request that a Company of U.S. Troops may be ordered from Cantonment Brooke Tampa Bay or some other Station to Camp King near the Seminole Indian Agency & to suggest as reasons therefor that there are a much larger proportion of slaves than white persons owned by the citizens within 30 miles of the Northern Boundary of the Seminole Indian Nation and more than 1600 Indian Warriors & 1100 slaves belonging to the Indians many of whom are traversing the County night and day

That the two Companies stationed at Cantonment Brooke Tampa Bay are over 100 miles distant from the Seminole Agency & at too great a distance to render any assistance in case of emergency That Barracks are already erected at Camp King & provisions can be transported by Water Communication within two miles of the Sarne.
The subscribers would also respectfully suggest that the troops could not only be advantageously employed in opening or repairing the roads passing through the lands of the United States but would be considered a great safeguard & protection to the Citizens of the County thereby inducing many to purchase & settle on the public lands &
increasing the Value thereof * -

HON. JONATHAN HUNT House of Rep"
SIR:
26th January 1832
In reply to your enquiries under the enclosed resolution,” I
have the honor to state that this Office is not apprised of any good reasons why Mess" Floyd and Allen late Commissioners on private land claims in East Florida are entitled to receive any compensation in addition to that already received by them agreeably to law—
In reference to that portion of the resolution the Subject of the expediency of paying the Registers and Receivers of the public land Offices a fixed Salary in lieu of the compensation now allowed by law, and concerning which you ask my opinion, I have to remark that the present mode of compensation, viz: a fixed salary of five hundred dollars per annum, and a Commission of one per cent on monies received, restricting the Commission to a minimum of $2500, as pro-

vided for by the Act of 20th April 1818,” has been found to be salutary in its operation, as affording a compensation in proportion to the amount of work to be done, and therefore doing away all claims for Clerk hire, when there is an unusual press of work—
In reference to the third enquiry under the Resolution and concerning which you request my opinion, I have to remark, that I do not conceive that the time has yet arrived when it would be expedient to reduce the number of Land Offices and consolidate the Land districts—
The Land Offices generally are now more profitable than they have been for any period since their establishment, and it is beleived that to reduce their number would cause a diminution in the Sales to an amount at least equal to, if not far exceeding any gain to the government by such a measure, by reason of diminishing of the facilities which now exist in making entries of government lands.
As it must be expected that individual emigrants will prefer purchasing at an advance of those who have purchased of the government, to incurring the increased expense and trouble in traveling to the Land Offices if in so doing they calculate that their expenses will equal if not exceed the advance they have to pay to individuals on the government price.
The Resolution and Mr Floyd’s letter * are herewith returned.
I am, very respectfully Sir, your obt. servt.

I was not advised of the existance of the charges perfered against me untill after my arrival at this place.
Therefore I am not prepared with all the testimony which I can produce in justification of my conduct as an officer of the Government.
Most of the persons acquainted with the transactions of my official conduct reside in Florida M Winslett whose certificate I have produced is one of the persons named by my accusers to prove the truth of the charges he is in the City and may be examined should the department think proper to do so."
Should the department think my answer with the certificates not sufficient to justify my conduct, I can at a future period produce satisfactory proof and explanation which I believe will relieve me from the imputation of any improper conduct whatever. It will therefore rest with the department to say whether a futher investigation shall be entered into "

HON le M MARCEY
Since my arrival in the City, I have been confined by severe indisposition from which I have not yet recovered. Every moment of my time when able to labour sinc my arrival has been devoted to the preparation of my response to the charges which have been exhibited against me-
The Committee, will see that the charges are of a character to require an investigation of my whole conduct as Governor of Florida and Sup" of In" Affairs from the time of my appointment in the year
1822 untill the present moment, which will necessarily impose upon me the labour of recuring to all the accounts vouchers, letters &c which relate to the charges Many of the charges relate to transactions in Florida—to which I
wish to oppose the testimony of respectable men two of whom are now in this city in the employment of the Government and are required by the Executive, as I am informed to repair to Florida on important and pressing buisness I mean Gen' James Gadsden and John Phagan In "Agent for the Florida Indians—my object is to know if the Committee would permit me to furnish them with interogatories to be by them, sent to these gentlemen to answer on oath, or would they receive the evidence and make such enquires as they may deem proper-
If this course should be considered unusual or informal, I beg to know what coure would be most acceptable to the committee, by which I
may avail myself of the benefit of the testimony of the persons refered to May I indulge the hope to be immediately apprised of the course which the Committe will addopt as these gentlemen expect to leave this on Saturday next and I have barely time considering the state

The Memorial of the Legislative Council of Florida, respectfully Sheweth, That at their present Session, in pursuance of an Act of Congress," they have incorporated a Company to connect the waters of the Appalachicola and Chipola Rivers with the Bay of St Andrews."
The importance of this Subject to the people of this Territory, and to the South generally will be estimated by reference to the character of the great Streams thus proposed to be united.—
The Appalachicola is one of the finest and largest Streams of the South, having as its tributaries the rivers Flint and Chattachouchee, both Considerable & extending to a great distance Northwardly, and having on their banks, even now, a respectable and thriving population.—
To afford a Suitable outlet to the produce raised on these Rivers and to Supply the defects in the navigation of the Bay of Appalachicola is the object of the proposed Canal.
The Complete adaption of the Bay of S*Andrews to these purposes is acknowledged by all who have Seen it, and will appear more evident from a letter addressed to a member of the Council, which from the character of its author, and his Known ability in the Service, is entitled to great credit. We think we are not mistaken in Saying, that it

presents a better account of that Bay than has ever been Submitted to the Public. The practicability of the Canal for a Small Sum in Comparison with the magnitude & importance of the work, will appear by the report of the Same gentleman, based upon actual Survey, which likewise accompanies this Memorial.”—
We hope that it requires no argument to prove, that the United States are also deeply interested in the Success of this measure;
they have already expressed that interest by the attention paid to applications made for permission to Cut it, and by their directions in their first act of Legislation on the Subject, that it Should be Constructed So as to form a link in the grand chain of communication Contemplated along the Gulf of Mexico:—
By a provision that officers and others engaged on business of the United States Should be exempt from toll, which was obviously intended with a view to the transportation of troops and munitions of war on the Canal, and which is Strictly Secured in the charter of this Session, they have further expressed their wishes as to its Success.
There is however no difference of opinion as to the practicability of this Canal, its usefulness, and the necessity of its Construction.
Whilst its importance is felt & acknowledged on all hands, and has created a warm and Zealous feeling in its behalf, it is feared that individual exertion will be unequal to the task, unless aided by the munificence of the General Government.
We trust we do not mistake in appealing to the generous Course that has ever been pursued by Government in advancing works of this Kind—
We do trust that our appeal on a Subject of Such engrossing and vital interest to our Country will not be ineffectual—
Resolved therefore, that our Delegate in Congress be, and he is hereby requested to use his exertions to procure from Congress a grant of land in aid of the Chipola and S*Andrews Canal Company, Be it further resolved, That our Said delegate be requested to use his further exertions to procure a Subscription of Stock from Congress to Said Company.—
Be it further resolved, that a Copy of this memorial, & resolutions, 

and of the Charter of the Company, be forwarded by the Governor to the delegate.—

<place-time>[February 12, 1832]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida respectfully sheweth, That the exigencies of a large portion of the People of this Territory, being those who reside in the Counties of Jackson, Franklin, Fayette and Gadsden, call for the establishment by Congress of an additional Judicial District to be composed of those Counties, and for the appointment of another Judge, Attorney and Marshal to reside within the limits of the said District. The three Counties first mentioned are now within the limits of the Western district of Florida.
Two of them Franklin & Fayette are newly created, the former from parts of the Counties of Washington and Gadsden, and the latter from Jackson.—
Such is the quantity of legal business accumulated in the Courts of the Western District, that it is impossible for the Judge of that District to perform all the duty required of him, and hold the Courts required by the Legislative Council. Indeed from the local situation of Appalachicola Bay, the difficulty of access to it and the nature of the business to be determined there, a judge could not do justice to the business at that place, and hold more than one or two Courts in addition elsewhere.—

Taking off these three Counties from his District, would leave the Counties of Escambia, Walton and Washington as his district, the duties of which would be less onerous & could be fulfilled faithfully.—
The County of Gadsden is at this time a portion of the Middle District of Florida. There are now depending in the Superior Court of that County, many criminal, civil and Common law proceedings undetermined, and with the most unwearied assiduity the Judge of the Middle District is unable to determine all the cases before him in the four Courts in his district, in one of which (Leon County) the Docket is generally the largest in the Territory.
A large portion of the Country comprising the County of Gadsden is covered by the claim of Forbes & C° and as that claim has been depending in suit, the Land has not been yet offered for sale, or even surveyed by the United States, and consequently that rapid settlement of the Country which the quality of the land and its peculiar advantages would have ensured, if it had been heretofore in the market, has not taken place.
The same facts exist in relation to a large portion of Washington &
Franklin Counties which are covered by the claim of Innerrarrity.
The claims of Forbes & C° and of Innerarrity have both been determined by the Courts of this Territory to be invalid, and whether (as is beleived) this decision will be confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States, or not, the lands in all three of the last mentioned Counties, must soon be forced by the clamors of the settlers upon it, into market.
The extensive and increasing cultivation of the lands in the upper Country near the Rivers Appalachicola, Flint and Chattahoochee in the States of Georgia and Alabama, and in this Territory, justifies the assertion that in a few years a town must grow up at the mouth of the former river, second in size and importance to none in the Southwestern Country except New Orleans.
Situated as the Country is at that time, with all the obstacles to settlement arising from its hitherto unsettled & uncertain title, and the almost total want of organization, the insecurity of property and of personal rights, owing to the difficulty of resort to Courts of Justice, yet nearly one hundred and fifty houses and stores have been erected, and it is estimated, that there are now deposited in store, cotton &
other products, the growth of the upper Country, to the amount of two hundred & fifty thousand Dollars—
Many vessels are employed in carrying cotton and other products from that port during the years in fact, it is beleived more than from any other port in Florida. Cases have arisen, proper subjects for suits in Admiralty, but owing to the difficulty of procuring process, the rights of those interested, have been abandoned. The necessity

of an Admiralty or Maritime Court, to which parties can resort without being compelled (if access is sought to the Judge of the Western district) to travel three hundred and fifty miles, or if to the Judge of the Middle District, nearly two hundred for process, must be manifest we think to your Honorable bodies.—
Your Memorialists are aware, that the expences of establishing an additional Court is an objection entitled to great weight, but they trust that Congress, with a spirit of liberality will regard the interests of the Community now suffering for want thereof, as of paramount consequence: and they do not also hesitate to say, that they beleive the interests of the General Government, in advancing the price of the public domain, by removing any obstacles to their settlement, will be promoted to a greater amount, than the expense of establishing and supporting the Court.
And your Memorialists, as in duty bound, will ever pray.—

<docbody>To the Congress of the U. States—
Your memorialists respectfully represent, That the Chipola River, is a stream the head waters of which rise in the State of Alabama, and uniting in West Florida about fifteen miles from the Alabama line, form a river sufficiently deep at all seasons of the year, to admit of navigation to the Appalachicola—
It is however obstructed by logs, & rafts, and in two places by shoals—

These obstructions may be removed at an expense of about six thousand Dollars so as to make it perfectly safe for boats drawing three to four feet water.
To the Citizens in this Section of Florida and also to those residing in three of the South Eastern Counties of Alabama, this improvement is of the first importance, as all their produce is at present shipped from Appachicola, a place totally inaccessible by land—
In its whole course it runs through the lands of the Government with the exception of a small portion which has been purchased by Individuals not amounting to one fortieth part of the whole, –This Improvement would doubtless enhance the value of the property of the U. S. to an amount greatly over the Investment required for clearing out the River,-
Your Memorialists would therefore, earnestly pray that the appropriation may be made for the River chipola as before mentioned—

<place-time>SAINT AUGUSTINE—East Florida. [February 29, 1832]</place-time>
<docbody>At a public meeting of the citizens held pursuant to notice on wednesday the 29* February 1832: Doctor Andrew Anderson was called to the Chair and K. B. Gibbs appointed Secretary. The object of the meeting having been explained by Doctor William H. Simmons, and the meeting addressed by John Rodman Esqr.; the following preamble & resolutions were unanimously adopted.
Whereas information has been received from Washington that certain individuals who signed the petition for the reappointment of the Honorable Joseph L. Smith, have secretly and by private letters to the President stated that the people of this District had no confidence in him and did not wish for his reappointment, thereby attempting to predjudice the President against Judge Smith and effect his removal from office; in consequence of which misrepresentations the President has it in contemplation to appoint another person in his place.
Therefore Resolved; that the petition sent to the President by the citizens of this District was a voluntary act on their part, uninfluenced by any fear, and expressive of the high regard and esteem in which they hold his character for Talent, Integrity, and Justice, and their approbation of his Judicial course.
Resolved; that the feelings and sentiments of the people of this district have been grossly misrepresented by those persons who by secret and private communications have attempted to impress the

President with the belief that the people of East Florida have no confidence in Judge Smith and did not wish for his reappointment;
and that we view with indignation the injustice of such an Extraordinary and dishonorable attempt to ruin a valuable and meritorious public Officer, and deprive the Territory of the useful services of one who has, in his department, done so much to promote its prosperity.
Resolved; that we repose the highest confidence in the experience, Talents, Integrity, Justice and impartiality of Judge Smith; that it is the wish of the people of this District that he be retained as their Judge; that his removal from Office will be received as a public grievance and misfortune, and with feelings of deep regret and disappointment, as the interests of the people and the Territory will necessarily sustain the most serious predjudice by a change of the Judiciary.
Resolved; that a certified copy of these proceedings be forthwith forwarded to our Delegate in Congress and that he be requested to submit them to the President.
Resolved; that the proceedings of this meeting be published in the Florida Herald.
Resolved; that the foregoing preamble and resolutions be signed by the Chairman and Secretary and the members of this meeting.

<place-time>[February 1832]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States The Memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, respectfully shews; that Common humanity unites withe the general policy of the Government in calling loudly for the removal of the Indians, located within the limits of this Territory, to the Westward of the Mississippi. The Treaty of 1823* deprived them of their cultivated fields and of a region of country fruitful of game, and has placed them on a wilderness, where the earth yields no corn, and where even the precarious advantages of the chase are in a great measure denied them. The only part of the land, that has been allotted to the Indians on the Peninsula, which is at all susceptible of Cultivation, is the heavily timbered hammocks with which Florida abounds. The characteristic improvidence of the Indians, forbids the hope that they will ever subdue these hammocks: and they are thus left the wretched alternative of Starving within their limits, or roaming among the whites, to prey upon their cattle. Many in the Nation, it seems, annually die of Starvation; but as might be expected, the much greater proportion of those who are threatened with want, leave their boundaries in pursuit of the means of subsistence, and between these and the white settlers is kept up an unceasing contest.
Your Memorialists beg leave to call the attention of your honorable body to the accompanying Copy of a communication from the acting Governor of Florida. It contains a Statement of facts, which your Memorialists think cannot fail to excite the benevolence of the Government in behalf of this miserable remnant of the savage tribes of Florida.
Your Memorialists are informed that all that portion of the Indians who are located on the Peninsula, are willing to remove, provided their Cheifs can be assured of being supplied at their new home with as many cattle and hogs as they own at present. Indeed there can be no doubt, that such have been their sufferings within the last four or five years, that they would now prefer any change to their present condition.
Your Memorialists would therefore respectfully pray your honorable body, to make an appropriation adequate to the expense of re-

moving these Indians, and the purchase for them, of a stock of Cattle and hogs equal to that owned by them here.
And your Memorialists &C.
On behalf of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida A. BELLAMY President
[Endorsed] Copy of Memorial.
[Enclosure]
Acting Governor Westcott to Abraham Bellamy Executive Office TALLAHASSEE Feb 2nd. 1832.
SIR, The resolution of the Council of the 23rd ultimo, requested me to furnish “such information as I might have shewing the means of subsistence and the present condition of the Florida Indians.”
There are within this territory, between four and five thousand of this population. Of these perhaps 1/5th reside on the Appalachicola river, and the residue on the peninsula. An annuity of $5000 is paid to them by the U. S. under the treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1823. Of this sum $1000 is paid to the Appalachicola towns and the remainder to the Seminoles. This annuity is to continue for twenty years after the date of the treaty. By it the U.S. were bound to establish a school at the Agency, but it has not been kept for several years owing I have understood, to the opposition of the Indians to it. The Appalachicola indians are perhaps some what better off than the others. Five or six chiefs on the Apalachicola are possess'd of considerable property in lands reserved to them by the treaty and in stock; and some few negroes are owned amongst them. There is considerable improved land on some of these reservations which is rented to Whites.
The common indians are however very drunken, lazy and worthless, and indeed none of their chiefs are entirely exempt from these vices.
In the distribution of the Annuity, some ten or fifteen of the head chiefs of both divisions, receive from $20 to $70 each, the lesser chiefs from $5 to $20, and the common indians generally between $3 and $4.
This distribution is I have no doubt equitably and properly made.
The money is however of but little service to the indians. Very few are in any wise provident, and the money is generally kept by them but a few hours or at most but a few days. About one half of the able bodied men are possessed of a rifle or gun but their arms are generally of little value. Those on the Appalachicola, living in the vicinity of numerous settlements of whites can readily sell their game and skins but the facility for sale is not so great nor the price paid as fair in the Seminole nation. The poorest Apalachicola indians when their corn is exhausted which is generally the case in Feb’ or March are

dependant on their Chiefs or are obliged to have recourse to hunting or working for the whites, to procure a subsistence. When there is scarcity among the Seminoles the most indigent are driven to the coonty or briar root, the sour orange, and other wild productions of the Peninsula; but it has been stated and I do not doubt that every year many of these miserable creatures actually perish for want of proper sustenance! Many who do not go down towards the capes for the coonty, wander out of the bounds of the reserve and throughout the country in large parties under the pretence of hunting. The region between the Oscilla and Suwannee, and between the Suwannee and the St: Johns, and beyond the St: Johns towards the Atlantic is on these occasions overrun by them and large companies have encamped within twenty miles of this City. When they are near the white settlements they create great alarm and disquiet. If drunk they are often insolent and ungovernable. The white settlers own thousands of cattle hogs &" running at large in the extensive ranges over which the indians roam, and upon this stock great depredations are committed. Detection of the guilty Indian, is almost impossible, and if detected no satisfactory redress is afforded to the owner of the stock stolen or killed. Nor is this the Only evil. They set fire to the woods, fences are burnt, and the safety of houses jeopardized. In some instances corn fields have been plundered and even personal outrage committed. The fisheries on the coast afford them some aid.
I have recently been informed that some twenty or thirty Seminoles are employed as fishermen and sailors on board the spanish fishing vessels frequenting our coasts and which supply the fish markets of Havanna and Matanzas. One half of the corn necessary for the Seminoles is not raised by them. They have not much land in cultivation, and they will not devote any great attention to agriculture. A more vagabond race do not exist on the face of the earth than the lower class of the Seminoles. Every year by this time their corn is gone and until the new crop in June or July, they go half starved. There are it is estimated three or four hundred negroes among the nation. A
few are owned by indians to whom they are of no value, but many are runaways from Georgia or Florida, and a very limited number are free.
Those negroes have great influence over them and in fact it is said control their chiefs and councils. Very few of the lower chiefs are possessed of property to any amount; and compared to what should be the case, but little stock is reared or owned amongst them. As these indians are now situated I am satisfied the attempt to keep them within the boundaries of the reserve will be useless unless they are furnished with the means of subsistence while there. They are driven from it by dire necessity. Their roaming at large has been attributed to the absence of the agent, but his presence would not

restrain them. All efforts to restrict them for the last three winters have been ineffectual. It is due to the Agent to state that he is now away by permission of the Superintendant and will speedily return as soon as official business with the government which I am informed called him to Washington, is completed. When he left the Territory Mr. Sheffield the Sub-Agent” was here but had he not been prevented by sickness would have gone down to the Agency forthwith.
He left this city for that purpose last week, but has I am informed been taken dangerously ill on the road.
The only hope for any good in regard to this fallen and degraded remnant of a people once high spirited and of noble character, is founded upon their removal at an early period to the southwest of Arkansas, separating them from the negroes now amongst them, and keeping them from all intercourse or association with the whites. If they remain in Florida they will continue in the same distressed situation and when their annuity ceases, eleven years hence, their wretchedness will be complete. Difficulties are also to be apprehended between them and the white population near them. Excited by their continued depredations and outrages, the latter are now restrained with difficulty from using the severest measures; and if hostilities once break out, the feeling held towards the indians is such, that it is to be feared they would cease only with their extermination! But if the humane efforts the general government are now using, in regard to the other tribes this side of the Mississippi, were extended to these, and their removal and settlement effected; and proper laws made for their regulation and protection; there is room for hope, that they would become a new people, recover their ancient spirit, cast off their vices, and avoid the certain fate of total extinction which inevitably awaits them in Florida.
Sundry documents are transmitted to the house containing the data upon which some of the foregoing observations are made, and also letters and memorials throwing light on this subject.
I am respectfully Y. Obt Serv" -

As a renewed application has been made to the Spanish Gov” for any papers in its possession, connected with this subject, it is deemed advisable that the trial of the suits, or such as you may think would be affected by the papers demanded from the Spanish Government, should be further postponed, to await the result of that application.

ACTING GOVERNOR WESTCOTT TO THE SECRETARY OF
THE TREASURY
[FSL:FL.A., Gov. Exec. Corr.:M*]
Executive Office TALLAHASSEE March 10th 1832.
SIR. On the 6th of Nov' last I addressed a letter to the register of the Treasury" in which I mentioned the sum of $7500 as the estimate for the appropriation for 1832 “for compensation & mileage of the members of the Legislative Council, pay of officers & servants of the Council fuel stationary printing and distribution of the laws &c”
exclusive of certain items for arrearages—compilation of Laws &c.
In that letter I specially referred to some additional expenses that it would become necessary to incur for new furniture for the Council but I thought I made the estimate large enough not only to cover all the expenses but that it was rather liberal. I wished if possible that the appropriation should not be exceeded as it has been for several years past. The result has proved that I judged erroneously.
A statement which I now enclose to you of the accounts certified and to be certified, (which I have not until to day been able to ascertain precisely) and which are payable at the U. S. Treasury & out of s”
appropriation shows an excess of $[blank] beyond it. The Governor of this Territory possesses little power to regulate most of the charges against this appropriation. The Council claims and exercises the power of electing as many Clerks and other officers as they please and of allowing them what they choose. The Statement shows the number they appointed this year and the amount allowed to each.
The excess is greatly attributable to the employment of such a liberal number of clerks and the liberal allowances to them. A considerable number of laws more than usual were however passed this year and very many more brought forward & considered which also of course increased the expenditures. The charges for miscellaneous printing
[$452] exceeds the amount paid last year more than $300.
A reference to page 120 of the Journals of the Council & to page 148
of the laws (transmitted herewith) will show that the “compensation bill” was vetoed on the ground of the allowances it made being too liberal & because together with the other necessary expenses not included in it would occasion the appropriation to be exceeded. It however became a law by the requisite majority of the Council.
I trust it will not be regarded as officious or obtrusive to suggest that in order to prevent such improper excess in future, that hereafter the Act of Congress making the appropriation shall allow a specific

sum for each item of expenses, according to the items of the estimate which when called for next fall will be carefully framed with such view, and (as the app" law does not generally pass Congress till after the Session of the Council is over and all the expenses incurred) and that on the receipt of the estimate of the Executive of florida a communication which he may lay before the Council at the opening of the Session be addressed to him in which the various items of the appropriation asked for shall be particularly enumerated, and also express instructions given not to certify any accounts beyond the allowances for each item of expense otherwise stated. This may perhaps restrain the Legislature from incurring expenses exceeding the appropriation, but no power possessed by the Governor alone can.
I regret the necessity of applying this application for an appropriation of $[blank] to meet the dificit excess above stated. I cannot however discover any course open at this time by which a deduction of the accounts to bring the expenses within the appropriation could be made or cause the loss to fall on them to whom the allowances have been too liberal. The outstanding creditors upon whom the loss occasioned by the witholding this appropriation are those most entitled—by whom the amount paid is most dearly earned & upon whom of all concerned no loss should fall. I trust an app" can be obtained this Session.
I have written to Col. White the Delegate from Florida on this subject and as I have made reference to this letter and its enclosure I beg that it may be submitted to him I am very respectfully Yr most obdt: servt.

I have, Sir, in compliance with your desire signed the Contract, and herewith return it. The present Post Master, Mr Rogers,” at the Seminole Agency has informed me that

he should resign his appointment so soon as the establishment of the Post office at the Post was carried into effect, as the proceeds of the Office there at the Agency will not defray the expense of carrying the mail from thence to Micanopi: therefore, I shall have to transport the mail from the 1* of next month, the period when it is now contemplated that this establishment shall go into effect, to and from Micanopi, a distance of 26 miles beyond the Agency.
Since the lameness of the horse; kept in past performance of that service, the mule alone has performed it, but now that the warm weather is coming on, he will not be able to do so, and I shall therefore put the horse which I purchased for my own use on the route.

<place-time>ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE March 22. 1832.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, In obedience to your directions I proceed to report to you the engagements of the Government with Richard K. Call Esquire as assistant counsel of the U. States. & the services rendered by him in that character in order to enable you to fix his compensation according to the act of Congress of May 23, 1828* S 11.—
In 1829 M’Call was employed as assistant counsel of the U. States in the three following cases which were brought in the different district Courts of the Territory of Florida.”
1. Arredondo & Son—vs—The U. States—claim for 289.645 acres—
2. Jn” Forbes & C*—vs—The U. States—claim for 1.500.000 acres—
3. Colin Mitchel—vs—The U. States—claim for 1.200.000 acres—
By M" Call's agreement with the then Secretary of the Treasury to whom you referred the subject of his compensation he was to receive

$500 in each case for his services in the Territorial Court & $1000 in each case in the Supreme Court where it was supposed that all of these cases would be finally decided.
One of them was brought in the District Court for the Western District of Florida—one in the middle District & one in the Eastern District—In two of them the Judgment in the District Court was in favor of the U. States, & in the case of Arredondo & Son the Judgment was in favor of the claimant. The last mentioned case was tried at the late Term of the Supreme Court & the judgment rendered against the U. States in the District Court has been affirmed."—The case of Mitchel against the U. States has been brought up to the Supreme Court & is continued until the next Term. In the case of Forbes &
C° the fraudulent character of the grant under which the party claimed was made so manifest on the trial in the District Court that the claimants have not appealed & that dispute is now finally settled in favor of the U. States.”
M. Call has received the compensation agreed on for his services in the District Courts—and also one thousand dollars for the argument of the case of Arredondo & Son in the Supreme Court.” But it appears to me that in addition to this sum of $1000, he is fairly entitled to his expences in attending the Supreme Court at the present Term.
When his contract was made with the Government, he naturally calculated that the three suits would all be brought to the Supreme Court—& had a right to expect that they might all be tried at the same Term, & that he would be required to make but one journey to Washington in order to fulfil his engagements.—And if that had been the case, the fees agreed on for his services in the Supreme Court would have been an adequate remuneration without any allowance for his travelling expenses—But unexpected and unforeseen occurrences will subject him to the inconvenience & expence of three journies to Washington on this business—He attended at Jan Term 1831 but neither of the cases were reached on the Docket. He has attended again at the late term & one of the cases is tried & the other continued over notwithstanding every exertion was made to bring on the trial—and M" Call will be obliged to attend again at the next session of the Court.
Under these circumstances if he does not receive from the Government his travelling expences, he will have but little left out of the fees above mentioned for the services rendered to the public in the Supreme Court.—And even with this additional allowance it will be seen that his compensation is a very moderate one, when we take into consideration the inconvenience & trouble of the journey & his long absence

from home & the consequent neglect for the time of his own business
& his other professional engagements.—Yet his services are too important to the Government to be dispensed with.—For his intimate knowledge of all the facts in these complicated cases & his familiar acquaintance with the Spanish laws & usages in relation to grants of land in the Spanish colonies, render his aid in the argument here of the highest value.
I understand that $500 will about cover the expences occasioned by his attending the Supreme Court at the Term just past.—and I beg leave respectfully to state that in my judgment he is justly entitled to this allowance.
He was I understand allowed the expences of his stage fare when he attended in 1831—and nothing more. But without proposing to undo any thing heretofore decided on, I can perceive no reason for limiting the allowance to that portion of his expences. For it is evident that if he receives the whole amount his compensation will be greatly below what an individual would be willing to pay for the like services in such a cause, where so much property is in controversy.
In February 1831 M" Call was by another contract engaged as assistant counsel for the U. States in all other suits instituted in Florida on land claims against the U. States."—No particular sum was named as his compensation for these services, because neither the Secretary of the Treasury nor himself knew enough of the business to enable them to determine what would be just, & the amount was therefore reserved for future decision.
It now appears by the Docket which I herewith submit to your inspection, that about one hundred suits have been brought against the U. States in the different District Courts—some of them for large tracts and each of them depending on their own peculiar circumstances
& consequently requiring a very careful & vigilant examination. The distance of the places at which the different courts are held rendered his services troublesome & expensive and the greater part of his time for the last year must have been occupied by his attention to this business.
The compensation for these services is yet unsettled & the amount proper to be paid has not been decided on. If he were allowed such fees as would be charged by counsel for the trial of each separate case where individuals only were concerned it would amount to a larger sum than the Government usually pays or ought to pay for services of that description. It would therefore be more economical as well as more consistent with the practice of the Government in analogous

instances to compensate M. Call by an annual salary & this mode would I have no doubt be satisfactory to him.—
In fixing his compensation in this manner it is proper to recur to what has already been done in order to form a fair estimate of what would be just to him & to the public.—The law agent in Florida receives a salary of $1500 & with the usual allowances of office rent, stationary & travelling expences he received in the last year altogether
$1691.—The services of counsel requiring learning & talents of another order ought not I think to be graduated by the same scale with that of an agent, but should be fixed with some reference to the ordinary remuneration for professional services, where they are called for by the Government or individuals. For by accepting the appointment of Counsel for the public, he surrenders all the emoluments which he might reasonably expect to receive from the individual claimants, if he had remained at liberty to be engaged on their behalf. I therefore respectfully suggest that a salary of $2500 would for the last year be a reasonable & fair compensation for his services.—Yet I am convinced that it is less than he would have received if he had refused to become the counsel for the public & left himself at liberty to advocate the claims.
I am aware that counsel fees in these disputed land claims amount to a considerable sum and occasion this item in the expences of the government to be much larger than usual. But the acts of Congress authorizing these suits to be instituted against the U. States have produced a new state of things & involved the Government in a mass of litigation perfectly unexampled in its history—& which unavoidably brings with it new & heavy expences.—As I have already stated about one hundred suits are now depending in the three District Courts of Florida involving property of great value. The claims are advocated by able and eminent counsel & they must be defended on the part of the U. States by competent talents, learning & vigilance—
otherwise the most valuable portion of the public domain may be wrested from the public upon unfounded & unjust claims. As the U. States have agreed to go into the courts as ordinary suitors they must take the usual & appropriate measures to maintain their rights.
And in order to secure the services of competent counsel they must incur the expences necessary for that purpose.—For it is evident that the District Attorney standing alone could not do justice to the Government in such a multitude of cases pressing for trial.—I understand nearly & perhaps all of these suits will be disposed of in the District Courts during the present year–And if that should be the case & the sum I have mentioned should be allowed to the assistant counsel for the last & present year, the whole amount ought I think to be considered as a moderate compensation in so many suits, depending as

they are in three different courts distant from each other, & necessarily therefore requiring & consuming the greater part of the time of a professional man during the two years.—
I have taken the liberty of presenting these circumstances in order to shew how it has happened that the claims for professional services of this description against the Government exceed at this time the ordinary amount. The additional expenditure has become unavoidable from the legislation of Congress in relation to these land claims.
The U. States are now Defendants in different Courts in a multitude of cases—many of them involving property of great value. And from what I have already seen I am convinced that the public will be deprived unjustly of a large portion of the national property unless competent and vigilant counsel are engaged to vindicate its rights.—
And this aid the public cannot obtain unless it consents to pay a sufficient compensation.—
In conclusion it is proper that I should call your attention to two cases which I understand are now depending at Key West, each of them for large quantities of land"—No assistant counsel has yet been employed by the Government in these suits & I believe no particular directions have been given for the defence. I submit whether some measures may not be necessary to guard the rights of the public in that quarter.”
& am with the highest respect Y” obt st R. B. TANEY—

<docbody>To the Hon. the Senate & House of Representatives of the United States In Congress Assembled The Memorial of the undersigned humbly shewith; that your memorialists Inhabitants Florida, are and have been for a long time

greatly annoyed by the Semenole or Florida Indians; who are constantly wandering from their own Country and trespassing upon the property of the Whites: Their depredations upon our stock; are so frequent and extensive, that we cannot for a moment, feel any thing like Security, in relation to this description of our property & unless Some measures are adopted by the Government to give us protection, we see no alternative left, but to abandon the settlements we have made at much expence & toil & retire to situation affording greater safety & less troublesome neighbours. We apprehend that unless the Indians are entirely removed from our Territory to some distant position, the evil in view, can not be effectfully remedied. The wildness
& unsettled character of the frontier, (being in extent more than three hundred miles) between the whites and Indians, afford much ample facility for them to indulge their national disposition to wander, that it will be next to impossible to confine them within their own Territorial limits:—But where were it possible to restrain & keep them at home, there is still to be found a most weighty objection to their continuing to occupy, (as they now do) a tract of Country, within the geographical boundaries, of of our Territory: in the fact, that absconding Slaves, find ready security among the Indians & such aid as is amply sufficient, to enable them successfully to alude the best efforts of their masters to recover them. It is believed that their are at this time, fifty or more runaway negroes in the Indian nation, who have taken refuge their since the treaty of 1823; * to whom the Indians give protection, (in the way of secrecy at least) notwithstanding they are in that treaty obligated by a solemn pledge to apprehend & surrender all Slaves who may seek shelter in their Country. So long as a state of things thus dangerous to the interests of the inhabitants of Florida continues she cannot hope for prosperity or improvement:
It cannot be expected that people of property will settle in a Country where their is so little security in relation to their property. We humbly pray therefore that your honourable body will take the matter into consideration and award to us such relief as is in your opinion necessary & proper.—

<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled—
The undersigned Citizens of the United States residing in the Southern district of Florida; Respectfully beg leave to call the attention of your Honorable body to an Act of the Legislative Council of this Territory passed at its last session entitled “An Act for the protection of the Fisheries on the Coast of Florida and to raise a revenue therefrom''," and to ask that the same be annulled for the following reaSOnS-
1* There are no fisheries on the Coast of Florida within the knowledge of your Memorialists other than those which have been established and are now in operation within the limits of this District—
2* Many of the persons engaged in those fisheries are foreigners and so far as they are concerned the Act in question will operate as a prohibition to the continuance of their business and as such, will do much injury to the revenue of the United States and to the Citizens of the District without affording the smallest benefit to any other class of Citizens.—As a proof of this your Memorialists have only to say that the persons engaged in this business within the last three years have paid into the Treasury of the United States in the way of duties upon Salt for curing their fish and for their supplies, and in charges upon their vessels, nearly five thousand dollars, as will be seen by the returns made to the proper department by the Collector of this Port; during which time they have expended and still continue to expend much

money in the purchase of Salt and other Merchandize from the Merchants here—
3* That so far as the provisions of the Bill relate to the American vessels they will occasion much annoyance and embarrassment, inasmuch as nearly all of them are owned out of the Territory and it is therefore inconvenient for said vessels to give the Bond required by the Act—
4* That oftentimes the scarcity of seamen within the District is so great that it is necessary to employ the seamen of foreign nations for navigating the vessels sailing out of this Port and if but one such should be employed on board any American Wessel—said vessel is obliged by the Act to pay annually $500–“privilege money”—
5* That your Memorialists are of opinion that the regulating of the Fisheries belongs to the General Government and that the Legislative Council" of the Territory have not the authority to pass any law operating as a restriction to the citizens of the United States engaged in such business
6* That many of the Foreigners to whom the provisions of the Bill more particularly relate were residents of the Territory long before the change of Flags and have remained so to the present time——
Ignorance of the language being the cause of their not having become Citizens of the United States For these and other reasons that will be apparent to your Honorable body in the features of the Bill Your Memorialists have presented this petition and trust that their prayer will be granted—

of the Bill introduced into the House of Representatives on the 21"
Ult” entitled “a Bill making provision for the Sale and disposition of the public grounds in the city of S*Augustine and Pensacola, and to reserve certain lots and buildings for public purposes, and to provide for their repair and preservation”—Your Memorialists refer especially to the 3"Section of this bill as particularly objectionable and to them wholly inxplicable but in one view of the subject—It is so decidedly opposed to what they have always understood to be the Settled and unvarying policy of your Honorable bodies in regard to the different denominations of Christians in this Country, that they cannot but fear its introduction has been procured by misinformation if not misrepresentation—Your Memorialists refer to this violation of the principle, which they believe has ever governed your Honorable bodies and which is involved in this Section, to abstain with sedulous care from favoring one religious denomination to the exclusion of others not from any supposed right on the part of your Memorialists to complain of such legislation, if it should be deemed proper in the present instance to adopt it; but simply that they may make it the occassion and the apology for throwing themselves on your consideration in regard to the provisions of the Section of Bill in question Your Memorialists beg leave to state that a controversy in regard to the title of the ground which is now used and which has for many years past been used as a burial place for all protestants now exists between the heads of the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches in this City; and your memorialists have cause to apprehend that this Section of the Bill has grown out of an unfair representation of the facts connected with that controversy and the present situation of the Common Burial ground—Your memorialists therefore respectfully represent that the ground which is now used as the Burial place of all protestants of this City was on the 14* January last conveyed to the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church of this City to be held by them In trust as a public Burying ground for the use of all protestants who may be brought there for interment; as will appear by a copy of the conveyance of one Thomas Alexander of the said premises herto annexed marked A* and to which your memorialists respectfully pray your Honorable bodies to refer—Your Memorialists beg further to state that on the reception of this conveyance the Trustees of the Presbyterian Church invited the heads of the Episcopal and Methodist Churches in this City to unite with them in the fixing and regulating such charges as might be supposed to be necessary or proper for the maintenance of the burial ground in decent order;

that this evidence of a desire to cultivate peace and harmony was wholly disregarded–
Without entering into the grounds on which the right of M Alexander to make this conveyance is opposed and supported your Memorialists merely state that it is denied by the heads of the Episcopal Church and affirmed by those of the Presbyterian Church the burying ground has recently been forcibly taken possession of by the Corporation of this City most unlawfully as your memorialists believe; but it is now as it has always been open to the use of Protestants of all denominations as will appear by the annexed documents marked B”
and to which your Honorable bodies are respectfully refered Your Memorialists independent of all exception to the principle of the 3" Section of this Bill and as Citizens of this place whose best interests are essentially dependent on its prosperity beg leave to represent that the appropriation of the Lot called “the old Dragoon Barrack Lot” is particularly objectionable because of the locality of this lot; that this lot is within the City Surrounded by others which are occupied and contiguous to the most thickly settled part of the town: That medical men here have given it as their opinion that this lot cannot be used as a burial place with safety to the health of the City; * and your memorialists believe that this opinion is sustained by the great anxiety manifested at the present day in all parts of our own country and in many parts of Europe to prevent the burial of the dead within the limits of Cities—Your Memorialists would respectfully add that the proposed appropriation of this particular lot for the purpose referred to is viewed with disapprobation and regret by almost the whole of this Community, as a measure which if carried into effect cannot fail to be most detrimental to their best interests all which is most respectfully submitted to the consideration and wisdom of your Honorable bodies—

DEAR SIR I have always endeavored to avoid giving my friends in Washington trouble in regard to appointments, and should not call upon you in the present instance, were it not for the deep interest

I have in common with all my fellow Citizens in this Section of Florida in the reappointment of Judge Webb whose term of service expires on the 24" of May next—I have understood that considerable opposition has & will be made to his nomination, and that too by people who have no interest whatever in the matter—
Judge Webb is extremely popular through out his district, not only as a Judge but as a gentleman, and I Sincerely believe that if his reappointment depended upon the voice of the people with whom he has resided nearly four years, two votes would not be recorded against him 67– *
In consequence of using ef public money which was deposited in his hands for Safe Keeping Judge Webb has been obliged to discharge a man by the name of Yancy from the clerkship of his court—This man left here yesterday in a clandestine manner and it is believed that he has gone on to Washington for the purpose of injuring the Judge—I have only to remark that he is worthless and no confidence ought to be placed in him—
Permit me to call your attention to this subject and to use your influence in favor of the reappointment of Judge Webb—Please present my be t respect to M.” Barry & family and believe me to be very Sincerely Your most obt S*

<place-time>WASHINGTON 30 April 1832</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. The frontier position of Florida, with a numerous Slave population, requires that a certain portion of our militia should be provided with arms, in order to meet Such emergencies, as may be presented.
The whole population of the Territory is about 35,000 the greater part of which is within my command. We are without Arms, Asenals, or military Postes. The Arms to which we are entitled under the

acts of Congress have not been delivered, and in the event of disturbences either by foreign or domestic enemies we Should be found perfectly defenceless. As a temporary defenee provision against Such evils, I propose to organize ten Voluntier companies of Infantry in the different Regiments of my Brigade, to be completely equiped and ready for Service when required. I have therefore to request that one hundred Stand of Arms may be delivered at Pensacola, and nine hundred at S* Marks from whence they will be received and distributed among Such persons, as may be thought worthy of them, and who will become responsible for their preservation.

Col: Gadsden has been selected for this duty, and I transmit herewith the copy of a letter received from him," by which it will be seen that he recommends an appropriation of five thousand dollars for the relief of these Indians.

<docbody>HON' LEWIS CASS Secretary of War SIR—In answering the letter to the War Department, from General R. K. Call of the 1 Brigade of the Florida Militia,” referred to this Dept. wherein he has requested the issue of 1000 Stands of Arms under the act of 1808.” for Arming and Equipping the Militia; I have the honor to state.—
That the apportionment of Arms to the Militia of the States and Territories under that act is made in the month of May in each year;
and is founded on the latest returns of the number of the Militia in each State and Territory, as reported to the Adj. General of the Army by the proper authority of the State or Territory; and as no return of the Florida Militia has ever been made to the Office of the Adj"
Gen' of the army until the 8" of November 1831," no arms have therefore been apportioned to the Militia of that Territory.—
The return here alluded to, give 827. as the number of Militia in the Territory of Florida; and it is estimated that the apportionment in May next, would give for this number about Ten Stands of Arms.—
But as 208, Stands were issued to the Territory on acct, in the years
1824" & 1826," it would appear to be indebted to the “appropriation for Arming and Equipping the Militia” to the amot: of 198 Stands Muskets.—

In addition to the above, it may be proper to remark—that the appropriation for the erection of an Arsenal in Florida, will enable this Dept. to afford, within the period of 12 or 18 months, a full Supply of Arms &" to meet any probable exigency in that Territory.”—

<docbody>SIR In order to complete the surveys on the Escambia River,” it was necessary to do some unfinished scrap work in several Townships, and it has been necessary to make some surveys of Private claims, not heretofore surveyed in those, and some other Townships, this additional work will amount to five or six hundred miles, which will soon be returned to this Office; and as all the recent appropriation has been exhausted under the last contracts, I hope you will forward me about twenty five hundred dollars to pay for those additional surveys. I do not at this time want more than that amount, nor until new contracts are made, of which you will be informed, as I do not wish to have the Public funds in my hands, until it is necessary to disburse them.”

<docbody>SIR Your letter of the 13th ultimo has been received “urging the transmission of all the returns due from this Office, also a diagram of such surveys as have been made, and to designate the Townships under contract, that have not been returned to this Office, and also to explain the cause of the delay in the transmission of the returns due from your Office.” "
The enclosed diagram ” exhibits the true situation of the state of the returns due from this Office; nearly one hundred Townships and

fractional Townships are now ready to be forwarded to the General Land Office, and the Registers Offices; there are remaining about twelve Townships yet to be finished, all under the last contract Copies of all the last contracts have been furnished your Office.
The resurveys on the Escambia, and its vicinity have not yet been returned to this Office, but will be in a short time, after a laborious resurvey of near five months by three experienced and persevereing Surveyors, those surveys will require much labour and time, to prepare them for the General Land Office, and the Registers Office, but will be completed and forwarded as soon as practicable for it to be done.
There have been no new contracts entered into since the last furnished you, as the Surveyors considered it a ruinous business to take contracts under your last instructions bearing date the 23. September
1831.”—but it is probable, that some contracts may be taken under your modified instructions of the 24th of October 1831.” received at this Office on the 27th of February 1832.
The cause of my not forwarding sooner to the General Land Office, the surveys made under the last contract furnished you was owing to a severe and protracting illness that had confined me to my room since the 14th day of July last, together with the occasional indisposition of both of my clerks yesterday, was the first day I have been able to go to my Office in nearly nine months, and I am now so feeble, I am unable to do business, and both of the Clerks in my Office are sick at this time. Mr Williams is very much indisposed indeed several of the Deputies were likewise sick, which kept their returns out of the Office much longer than was expected.
thus you will see, that causes beyond my controul, or others, have retarded the progress of business in every branch of this Department.
You may rest assured, that so soon as circumstances within my controul will Justify the completion of the surveys due the General Land Office they will be forwarded without delay.

<place-time>BALTIMORE. April 18" 1832.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, In answer to your letter of yesterday I have the honor to state that M Ringgold, the late District Attorney of Florida, was detained in Washington the winter before the last at my request, & as I understood, with the concurrence of the government. The circumstances were these. The President was anxious that the case of Colo.
Mitchell against the United States should, if possible, be argued and decided at that term;—M Ringgold had, as District Attorney, tried the cause in Florida, with the aid of Gen' Call & perhaps the law agent.—He was, therefore, familiar with the cause, knew all that the transcript of the record ought to contain, and whether certain original papers, whose genuiness had been impeached in the Court below, had been properly selected & Sent up. The transcript & documents had not arrived until Some time, I think, after the commencement of the term; nor had General Call, who had been retained to argue the cause with me, arrived. The record, after it sh" come to hand, would remain to be printed, & I had not the leisure to Superintend the press. Under these circumstances I thought it the interest of the government that M Ringgold should be detained to inspect the transscript & documents after they Should arrive & See that the cause was Standing on the appeal as it had Stood in the Court below, to Superintend the printing of the record, which was very voluminous, and to aid me by his familiarity with all the points in the cause in the Speedy preparation. I was expected to make for the immediate argument. His detention w” have been unnecessary if Gen'Call had been on the ground, but he had been delayed in setting out from Tallihassee & retarded in his journey by the bad roads of the winter.
I had no interview with the Secretary of the treasury on the Subject of M* R's detention.—M R however, told me, that he saw him repeatedly, as well as the President, & that the course which I had advised was approved. The record was printed under his Superintendance on the part of the Government & Colo: White's, on the part of Colin Mitchell, and M Ringgold remained until Gen'Call's arrival, which was, I think, late in the Session. I thought it probable that I
had written to the Secretary of the Treasury as to the propriety of M” R's detention—but I Suppose I must be mistaken as you Say that there is nothing in the department concerning it. I remember that I Saw M. Maxcy, the Solicitor of the treasury once, or oftener, on the Subject of the cause:—perhaps it was to him that I wrote instead of the Secretary & He will probably be able to recall the course of the transaction. M R's Superintendance of the press can no doubt be

attested both by Colo: White & General Green, the printer Selected, as I understood, by the goverment to print the record; and I know that I had divers useful consultation's with Mr R on the various points of the cause before the arrival of Gen' Call.
As Soon as the record was printed & ready for the court, we pressed the argument of the cause. It was resisted by the then Attorney General Mr Berrien, Colo: White & M Webster who were of consel for the appellant, & the cause was continued at their instance. At the last term the counsel on both Sides were ready for the hearing &
concurred in pressing it on the Court; but it was thought too late in the term to take up & decide So important a cause on So voluminous
& complicated a record. These are all the facts within my recollection connected with the Subject of your inquiry.
I have the honor to remain, Sir, very respectfully, Your obdient Servant Wm WIRT

<dochead>REPORT OF HOUSE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.:AD *]</source>
<place-time>[Referred April 26, 1832]</place-time>
<docbody>The Committee on Agriculture to whom was refered the Memorial of Dr Henry Perrine " Consul of the U States at Campeche, and a Resolution of the Legislative Council * of the Territory of Florida recommending a grant of land in that Territory for the encouragement of the growth of new and important agricultural products, exotic vegitables & Tropical plants have had the same under consideration
& Report—
The plan and object of the Memorialist Dr Perrine are explained in his petition hereto annexed and made a part of this Report (No 1)
Dr Perrine has been for some years the American Consul at Campeachy and Tobasco, being a man of science and industry, he has devoted a great portion of his time for the last four years in the Collection of the most rare and valuable Tropical plants, medicinal shrubs Trees &
fruits, Dye woods and other productions of the Mexican States in which they abound—From the testimonials exhibited to the com-

mittee they are satisfied that from the extensive acquaintance of this gentleman in that Country, the high estimation in which he is held by the public authorities of Mexico that he has it in his power to obtain & import pertant to this Country the most useful and valuable acquisitions to our National agriculture—
The Committee do not deem it necessary to offer any remark on the subject of the practacability of such an enterprize—The history of the world shews that in all ages & Countries Trees vegitables, grains &
plants have been successfully transplanted, & domesticated from one country to another-Ha ette Gethtry where we have every variety ef seil and elimate perhaps less has been dehe than in ahy ether in the same tihae—As a general principle of action for the national legislature it is better to abstain from any legislation upon such subjects leaving them to individual enterprize and exertion—There are some cases however in which it would be unwise and impolitick not to furnish some facilities in aid of our enterprizing fellow Citizens—The Greeks and Romans obtained at the public expence a number of grains, vegitables & plants from Africa & all the modern States of Europe have made it one of the leading considerations of National policy to promote new acquisitions to the agriculture, as well as to the Commerce of the Country—
The U States have acquired eighteen or twenty millions of acres of land by the late Treaty with Spain, now almost entirely uninhabited, the largest portion of which is incaple of producing any article now cultivated in the U States—This immense tract of land on the borders of our Union must lie unemployed and useless for many years without some experiment such as Dr Perrine proposes—The Committee have therefore determined to report a Bill setting feeth apart for this object one Township of the public lands to be granted to him & his associates, upon condition of its occupancy & successful Cultivation-
The committe annex to this Report a number of documents & letters explanatory of the object & shewing the importance of the proposed experiment, numbered from 2 to 7–
The Committee also annex a Copy of the Treasury Circular to this report No. 8. and Translations from a recent work on Cuba made by the Delegate from Florida shewing the extent and value of the productions of that Island and the great importance of the introduction of the same articles as far as practicable into this Country."

SIR I herewith forward you a monthly report of the operations of improving the Harbour of St Marks.
The work has been continued at the cut through the bar forming the Devils Elbow, which is now completed to the rock: in most of the cut to give 10 feet water, but in a few places no more than 8% feet, * This commission was probably delivered to DuVal in Washington as no transmittal letter has been found. See ante, p. 652.

where the rock was too hard for the buckets to cut into it. These hard places will require blasting to remove them."
The cut is 60 feet wide at the bottom and 100 feet at the top. Wessels may now pass freely with 6 inches more water than in the old winding channel.
Seven hundred cubic yards of Shells & stone has been removed during the month; much less than the amount in the previous month, which was occasioned by the giving way of the T head of the S. Engine and the wheel that works the chain of buckets.
The work, from the time I took charge of it, may now be considered as half completed in the harbour.
There will be full $2,500 left of the available funds for improving the Harbour & River of St Marks after the harbour is completed, and I
would suggest the propriety of opening the natural bridges above Magnolia and going on with the improvements of the river above them agreeably to the plan given in my report of Feby 15" 1832” as soon as it may be conveniently done, the following season.

estimate submitted by you in February last. The additional amount required to effect the object in view has to be obtained through the action of Congress and as the improvement in question is deemed to be new, not being embraced in the original project submitted for improving the S" Marks river, it became necessary to refer it to the delegate of the Territory in order that it should be brought up for consideration as an original proposition, in such manner as he may think best. You will therefore postpone making any arrangement in relation to that improvement until you are further advised from this Department.”

<docbody>SIR You are aware that by the 10 Section of the Act of the 23 May.
1828 Entitled “An Act Supplementary to the several Acts providing for the Settlement and Confirmation of private land Claims in Florida”
the President is Authorized to appoint a Law Agent,”—to Continue him in place So long as the public interest requires his continuance, and to allow such pay to the agent as he may think reasonable.—An agent was accordingly appointed and has been so far compensated by an Annual Salary fixed by the President. In that part of the General Appropriation Act of the 5 May last which contains An Appropriation for Compensation to Assistant Counsel and District Attornies under the former Act it is provided “that nothing herein contained Shall be So construed as to Authorize the payment of a Salary to the Law Agent in Florida”” It is presumed, however, should the continued services of the Agent be necessary that it will be competent for the President to compensate him in such other mode as may be reasonable and proper. With a view of bringing the subject before the President I will thank you to favor the Department with any information in your possession tending to shew the usefulness of such agent in the present Stage of the Judicial proceedings in cases Arising under the Act;—And the mode by which you would recommend the Agent to be compensated in the event of its being deemed adviseable to Continue the office:—And the amount of such Compensation."

hundred are returned to the office of year the Adj* General under in your Department *—Without arms it is impossible in time of peace to inspire any people with military pride and spirit The want of arms is sensibly felt and trust you will have it in your power to supply them—I do not consider a Territory, within the restrictive provision of the act of congress regulating the distribution of public arms,” among the several states, but should you give the law a different construction yet the act has a clause in it, which empowers the President of the United States, to issue to any frontier exposed to danger such arms as he may consider necessary—without regard to the actual number of militia, as returned to the Adjt.
Generals Office—I do not pretend to give the words of the law, only the substance In middle Florida we have not one cannon or field piece and very few muskets or rifles—The militia of the whole Territory can not be less than seven thousand, under this statement, of facts it is my duty to lay before your Department the following requisition for arms—as actually required for the peace and safety of our citizens Two six pounders with such other arms and equipments as usually belong to a company of light Artillery—120 pair Pistols & sabers for two companys of Cavelry—120 muskets & &c for two companys of Infantry 120 Rifles &c. &c for two companys—These arms may be sent to the port of St Marks—Middle Florida—

<docbody>THE HON" LEWIS CASS Secratary of War Co" Gadsden having made a Treaty with, the principal part of the Florida Indians,” it is necessary now to appoint another sub agent as their is but one attached to my superintendency—
The Agent Majr. Phagan, will be much absent from his post for several years to come first with the deputation of Indians who will go to examine the country west of the Mississippi and afterwards with the emigrating parties—I therefore recommend William Pope Esqr of Florida as a proper person for sub agent”—I will suggest the propriety of writing to the Indian Agents residing in the country where the deputation under Majr. Phagan, are about to visit, to receive them in the most hospitable manner and to render them as much satisfied with the Indians under their controle as possible I know the Florida Indians are under much apprehension from their countrymen in that quarter—
Co" Gadsden has informed me that the Indians desire to receive their annuity before the deputation leaves home I request the annuity may be remitted to the Agent, and that the check or draft may be drawn on Charlston This would save time, trouble, and expence as it will be more convenient for the Agent to receive the money at Charlston than at New Orleans or Mobile I am Respectfully Your Obt Sert Wm P.

In Some of the cases (as I wrote you by last mail)* Letters Rogatory have been granted to take testimony in Cuba (which cases the returns will Shew) most of this testimony will be sought for at Havana, I will forward you the names of the witnesses as Soon as I am furnished with them.

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR May 31, 1832.</place-time>
<docbody>HONBLE GEORGE MCDUFFIE Chairman of the Committee of Ways &
Means House of Reps:
SIR, I have the honour to enclose an estimate, prepared by Colonel Gadsden, of the expenditures necessary to be incurred by a party of

the Seminole Indians in exploring the country West of the Mississippi."
Colonel Gadsden has recently concluded a treaty with these Indians for the cession of their lands in Florida; * but the treaty is not obligatory upon them, till a deputation, which they are to send, shall have examined the country, to which it is proposed to remove them, and reported favourably concerning it.
I think the estimate of Colonel Gadsden is low, excepting the compensation proposed to be allowed to Major Phagan. Should he be sent with the party as he is already in publick employment his expenses, together with a small additional compensation, in consideration of the change in the nature of his duties, are all, which should be allowed. But as this duty may not be assigned to him, as Colonel Gadsden has made no provision for the payment of an interpreter, and as I doubt whether seventy five cents per day will procure “horses, tents, interpreters, guides, blankets, clothing, camp apparatus” &"
I would suggest the propriety an appropriation for $3000, as recommended by Colonel Gadsden—agreeing with him that this sum will be necessary, but that it will not be necessary to make to the Indian Agent the full allowance contemplated.
Colonel Gadsden has informed me, that the sum of five thousand dollars asked for upon the application of the Florida Indians, to relieve their wants will not be required for that object—I venture to suggest therefore that the appropriation now asked be substituted for that.”

<place-time>WASHINGTON D. C. 31 May—1832</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. The Indian reservations on the Applachicola river include in all Sixteen sections or fractions of land, containing about 10.140 acres, which at the minimum government price would be worth 12.675 dollars—I entertain little doubt however, from the favourable location of the two reservations occupied by Econchattemico, and Mulatto King, and containing about 5120 acres of land, that they would readily command at this time 4 dollars per acre, equal to 20.480 dollars, and

that Blunt & Tuskehajos', would probably bring half that amount $10.240 making in all 30.720 dollars— My impression is, from the conversations held with Blunt, the principal chief on the Appalachicola, that 5000 dollars will be received for his and TuskeHajos' reservations, and that 4000 dollars would probably purchase the land occupied by the other Chiefs, the Government stipulating at the same time to pay for the cattle belonging to the Indians on valuation, and to defray the cost of transportation to the new country, with 12 months supply of provisions as provided for in the several treaties of removal, and at a rate in money; which has been ascertained, in the execution of those treaties, to be the expence of removal, and the cost per ration to each Individual—An estimate therefore to accomplish the object of removing the Indians in the Four Towns from the Appalachicola river may be made thus— Payment for reservations surrendered— $9000. — Transportation of 600 Souls a $20 per head based on the Cost of transportation of the Cherokees who are not as remote from the New Country as the Florida Indians 12,000 — Rations for 600 Persons for 12 months at 7% cents per day—the present price of Indian rations 16.420. Payment for 600 Head of Cattle a $4 2.400. $39.820 Deduct probable amt cattle resold at public sale—$3 1. 800 $38, 020 The cattle taken at valuation & subsequently sold at public auction may possibly involve a loss, by forcing so large a quantity into a limited market—I have estimated this loss at 1 Dollar the Head; the amount however will depend very much upon the Agent entrusted with the sale * respectfully Your Ob St JAMES GADSDEN

<docbody>SIR, In answer to your letter of the 18" of May last " I have the honour to state, that under the act of March 2. 1831 * where lands have been acquired by the U. States, according to the provisions of that law no person has a right to cut or remove timber from such lands upon the ground of any pre-emption claim set up by him until his title to the land claimed is either acknowledged by the Government or maintained by the judgment of the Court.—The person therefore who cut & removed the timber for the purpose of building the vessel mentioned in your letter may be prosecuted under the 1* Section of the act above mentioned. But the vessel built of the timber improperly cut and carried away cannot be libelled under the 2* Section unless she takes on board timber contrary to the provisions of that section.
In other words the vessel built of timber unlawfully taken from the lands of the U. States would be liable to be proceeded against under the second Section of the law in those cases only where the libel could be sustained against any other vessel if employed in the like manner.

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR June 25, 1832</place-time>
<docbody>WILLIAM B. LEWIS Esq SIR, The President having directed, that the accounts of Gov.
Duvall for his services & expenses should be opened & reconsidered, I have accordingly taken up his claim,” & have allowed him five dollars a day, to include his services & expenses, for the time charged by him.
My view of this case is this. Gov. Duval is ex officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Florida, & as such it is his duty to superintend &
direct the general operations of Indian Affairs. But he is under no legal obligation to execute those specific & detailed duties relating to Indian intercourse, which require the personal communication of the officer with the Indians, in various parts of the country, unless particular provision is made therefor. If he were, the whole business of the Indian Department might devolve upon him. And certainly, duties of this kind are not fairly within the meaning of the word, “Superintend”, which implies rather a supervisory authority, than the personal execution of details. I find no law, directing Gov. Duval to investigate these questions about Slaves, & I do not think the duty was one, which the law imposed upon him.
That the Department has heretofore taken this view is clear from the fact, that this duty was at one time assigned to judge Smith.
If the law gave it to Gov. Duval, the Department could not, with any propriety, give it to another.

His equitable claim to compensation is therefore clear, & with respect to the amount, in the absence of certain data, & probably under circumstances which render their production impossible, I have allowed compensation upon the principles above stated.
Very respectfully LEW. CASS.

<docbody>COL. JAMES GADSDEN
SIR, I have received & submitted to the President your letter of May 31. 1832,” & I am now to communicate to you his views thereon.
He wishes you to Seek an interview with the Indians interested in the reserves you described upon the Apalachicola river in Florida, being sixteen Sections or fractions, containing about 10.140 acres.
There are no objections to the amount demanded $9000, for the value of the land. But the other Sums required for the expenses of emigration & subsistence & for the payment of their cattle, amounting to Twenty Six thousand & twenty dollars, would make the purchase a very dear one for the United States. Nor is it in the power of the Department, in the present State of the funds applicable to Such objects, to pay the whole amount, that may be Stipulated, before an appropriation can be asked for. You will therefore propose to the Indians to pay them a Sum in no event exceeding thirty thousand dollars, in full for their land, the expenses of emigration & subsistence, & for all their other claims. Ten thousand dollars of this amount you can draw for, as Soon as the arrangement is made with them, &
the rest will be paid as soon as an appropriation can be obtained, &
from time to time, within one year, as their circumstances may require.
It will of course be applied by themselves. Should this arrangement be acceptable, you will take from them an absolute conveyance of all their lands in Florida to the U. States; stating therein the amount you may pay, together with the Sum remaining due, & the periods fixed for payment. -
If the Indians Should prefer having the U. States issue provisions to them, instead of purchasing themselves, that course may be adopted, with the understanding however, that the amount So to be issued, when added to the Sums allowed, Shall not exceed the maximum before mentioned, of $30.000–
You will be allowed eight dollars a day for your Services, & five

dollars for every twenty miles you may travel, in executing this duty.
But it is not considered necessary that any Secretary Should be employed, nor any other expense incurred.
It has been suggested to the Department, that these Indians are desirous an annual appropriation Should be made for the education of their children. Should this be So, the Department has no objection to a Stipulation for that purpose to a reasonable amount, depending for its fulfilment upon the appropriation of Congress, but not making it an indispensable condition of the arrangement.
A copy of this letter has been Sent to Gov. Duval,” & should it be inconvenient for you to execute the duties herein specified, he has been requested to carry these instructions into effect.”
Very respectfully LEW. CASS.

Thomas Baltzell to Delegate White OAKY HILL June 20th 1832
DEAR SIR Understanding that an appropriation has been made to repair the road between Marianna and Pensacola I take the liberty to make some remarks directing your attention to the subject in the hope that some benefit may be derived from this additional act of munificience of the Gov". It is with regret I state that the last appropriation was so disposed of as to produce no efficient good. From the best information I can get not any service has been rendered. This from what I can learn was owing in a great measure to the loose bargains made by the agent of Government and the slight attention paid by him to the business confided to his care. Instead of laboriously devoting himself for two or three weeks to the business I am informed that he made a hasty excursion through the country without acquiring the suitable information or making the arrangements proper to accomplish the work.
It would be proper for me to remark too that no work was done on the road within fifteen er twenty or thirty miles of Marianna but that portion of it the most important of any was neglected. Nor was this because the appropriation had expired. I understand that there are yet two hundred dollars to be devoted to that object from the former appropriation.
If some other agent can be selected but an officer of the army we may possibly get a good road and derive some advantage from the appropriation otherwise I fear we have nothing to hope for.
Such a man as Lieut Long would do more than fifty officers of the army unless their duty is better performed than it has been heretofore.
I hope I shall be excused for pressing upon you the importance of an early engagement in this work. In consequence of the wretched condition of the road the mail stages have not been carried farther than Marianna on the route to Pensacola for nearly twelve months past and indeed after the repair of the road I believe that the stage ran only a few months.
I do not hesitate to say that if the money from last appropriation had been properly expended the road would now be in good repair
& much travelled The work is one of considerable importance to the people of the territory as well as the United States & very sanguine expectations are raised that good will arise from the last proposed expenditure.
I have nothing further to write at present but remain Yours very truly T BALTZELL

P. S. On reflection it strikes me that some direction should be given to the officer having charge of the work in altering the road so as to go over better ground or to take the mail south as was directed in the previous order.

<docbody>LIEUT: JOHN L'ENGLE, Asst: Q Master, U. S. A. Saint Augustine, SIR: At the last Session of Congress, an appropriation of four thousand dollars was made, for completing the repairs on the Military road between Pensacola and Tallahassee, and two Thousand five Hundred dollars for that part lying between Tallahassee and Saint Augustine"—I have requested, that the amount of those appropria-

tions be remitted to you; and you will, as early as practicable, resume your operations on those works, and carry them on with as much promptness as may be, consistently with a due regard to economy and their faithful execution.
Particular instructions are deemed unnecessary, as your experience of last year will guide you in the operations of this. From the tenor of your report, at the close of the last Season," it is presumed, that no labor will be necessary west of Oak Hill, and as the appropriation somewhat exceeds the amount of your extimate for the completion of the repairs through to Tallahassee, it will, no doubt, be adequate to that object.
Notwithstanding the terms of the appropriation for the Eastern Section, which refer to the Military road, you will consider the amount granted, applicable to the road leading from Alachua Court House to Jacksonville and expend it accordingly—It was for the latter that the estimate was made, and the appropriation beyond doubt was intended for it.—
I enclose you a letter, referred to me by Mr. White, the delegate from Florida, signed by several individuals, who are desirous to obtain a contract.” Prior to concluding any Contracts, you will take pains to inform yourself accurately, as to the state of the road, the nature of the work to be bestowed on it, the character and responsibility of bidders and their ability to fulfil their engagements."—

During the month we experienced a Severe Storm which put back the work 8 or 10 days otherwise the dredging would now be completed.
This part of the work I have now a prospect of finishing in a time equal to that lost by the late Storm—
The operations have continued on the Apalachicola River, to remove the logs that could not be got at last year, to clear away some trees that had fallen into the river & obstructed its channel & to remove the heavy timber that was likely soon to be washed in with the falling-in banks. This will complete all the improvements that can be made on the river to be of any benefit whatever to its navigation; and such is the Character of some parts of the river that these improvements even, will be of but a temporary benefit. On my recent visit to the river I thought it proper to expend but 8 or 10 days work more upon it, when the boats machinery &c employed there will be transfered to the St Marks river above the Nat Bridge.”

To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, In reply to your letter of the 21" ult” enclosing Copy of a letter from Major Phagan, I have the honor to observe, that your application for an increase of the allowance for provisions to your Superintendency, should have been accompanied by an estimate, shewing in detail the number of Indians to be fed, the number of days necessarily to be spent in paying them their annuities, the cost of the

730 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S ration, and the total amount required. Under the circumstances, the Department has concluded to authorize you to draw for 250$, to be charged to and paid out of the fund for the relief of the Seminoles, by the Act of May 31,” which draft you will accompany with such an estimate as is above prescribed. This remittance, with the 250$ for the last half of the current year, must be made to meet all the expenses of feeding the Indians, and that amount will not be exceeded without express authority from the Department. The time, (from ten to fifteen days) mentioned by the Agent as necessary to the paying of the annuities, seems unreasonably long. It is double the time employed in this business in other tribes of double the number. Your Agent will be specially instructed upon this point, for good seldom, if ever, results from this prolonged association with our settlements.
Whether you shall yourself visit the agency is a question you must determine; it is impossible for the Department to say, whether the measure be essential to the full and faithful performance of your official duties. Of this it can only judge by results.
Doct" Hamiltons resignation has been received.”
The compensation offered him cannot, at present, be increased.
You will endeavor to accomplish the object of the Government, under the instructions given you. And, in any event, you will have the Deputation, who are to proceed west, vaccinated before their departure.
An Act of Congress, passed at the last Session, contains the following provision.
“That no ardent spirits shall be introduced into the Indian Country, under any pretence whatever.” "
To give effect to the intent of this provision, you will direct your agent and Sub agent to Seize the prohibited article, whenever and wherever found, within your Superintendency, and to deposit it where it will be safe and beyond the reach of violence, should any be attempted, subject to the order of the Department. Of their pro-

F L Q R J D A 7" E R H J 7"O R Y 731
ceedings, under this order this order, you will keep the Department regularly advised. If it is strictly enforced, at the approaching meeting for the payment of the annuities, the traders you mention will have less power to operate upon the minds of the Indians.
You will explain to the Seminoles, that this measure is dictated by the interest of the Government feels in the welfare of the red men, to whom it sustains a parental relation.
The Department is determined rigidly to enforce this law, and it requires the officers in the Indian Department to exercise an unremitting vigilance in the performance of the duties this law imposes upon them.
I am &c.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE 12" of Sep" 1832</place-time>
<docbody>SIR Permit me to recall to your recollection the understanding I
had with yourself and M Ingham, relative to my compensation as Receiver for transporting and depositing the Public Money received at this Office.
The compensation allowed by M. Rush under the Act of the 22"
of May 1826," was so far short of my actual expences in the performance of this service, and as I conceived so little within the spirit and intent of the Act that I invariably refused to accept of it, and as my accounts will shew I made no charge of the percentage on the amount deposited until May 1831. While at Washington in the Spring of 1831, I informed you and M Ingham of the difficulty in making my deposits, and the expences necessarily attending them. You both agreed that the compensation was too small and that as I had not accepted the allowance or made any charge under the regulations of M" Rush, that an additional allowance should be made.”
The instructions of the Department required me to make a deposit whenever the sum received amounted to $10,000. The distance to Mobile the place where I was required to make my deposits is 407.
The per centage on this sum under the regulations of M" Rush at the rate of the fiftyeth part of one per cent for every ten miles would be eighty one dollars, forty cents. The Stage fair through this country is 10 cents per mile, which on 407 miles, just equals the amount of com-

732 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S. pensation, leaving nothing for the subsistence or pay of the carryer.
The time required to perform the trip was usually 20 days, no trustworthy person could be employed for a less sum than five dollars per day, and his subsistence would be about $2 per day, making $140.
Thus the Receiver without being allowed any thing for the “risk”
would be brought in debt for the actual expences $140 on every deposit of ten thousand dollars.
On these facts being represented to you and M Ingham, I was authorized to charg in addition to the fiftyeth part of one per cent
25 cents per mile, for every mile actually travelled in making the deposits, in full Compensation for the risk, labour and expences provided for in the Act of the 22" of May 1826. This I did and gave myself credit for 15 trips performed between the years 1825, and 1831, as will appear in my account for the month of May 1831. This item has been suspended at the Treasury Department, and the object of this letter is to obtain from you a statement of the facts as they occurred between M* Ingham you and myself, so far as your recollection will serve you.

You and Col White have both been informed from time to time heretofore, of the causes why those claims were not surveyed sooner,"
That your attention may be drawn to the facts, those claims were situated in the townships that were suspended, the completion of which was prevented by high water sickness, and information necessary for identity.

<docbody>Sir. I returned yesterday from the Appalachicola river where I
had an interview with Blunt, the principal chief on the Indian reservations in that district—The propositions I had to make him, conformable to your instructions,” fell so short of the expectations he had, no doubt, been induced to encourage from private interference, that he required some further time to deliberate with his people & the Chiefs alike interested in the removal—They will meet me on the
10" of next month at the Executive office in Tallahassee, prepared either to accede to, or reject the arrangement I offered to conclude with them—It is true policy, at least with the Appalachicola Towns, to state explicitly what the General Government will do; not to deviate from, or negotiate on the propositions made, and leave the Indians to their own judgment, which will invariably prove to them a better guide to their true interests than the private influences which are exercised behind the curtain; deceiving them as to the great anxiety of the General Government on the subject of their removal, and encouraging delay as the surest plan of obtaining their extravigant demands—The Appalachicola Indians, (at least the Chiefs) are well convinced they cannot live on their present locations—That they must follow the Migrating Creeks & Seminoles west, and if they at this time are induced to reject, the period is not far distant, when they will themselves petition for the conditions of that very compact now proferred them by the Executive of the U States 8–

<docbody>SIR Permit me to call your attention to an occurrence lately happening at this place in relation to one of the lots belonging to the government, and to ask your advise conserning it.
The City council, being vested with the power by the the act of incorporation to open streets, remove buildings and so forth, lately thought fit to extend a street through the lot alluded to, and to remove an old building standing upon it, being that used as a court house. The value of the lot may be $400, and the building, very old and decayed, was estimated by the jury to be worth only $20–;
and the jury, saying in their virdict that the lot would be appreceation in value by the extension of the street, assessed no damages to the government.
The deputy Marshal, being a member of the board of Alderman, was not disposed to prevent the proceeding, and the Judge of the County court, having the power to grant writs of injunctions; also an alderman and the principal mover in the Matter, I concieved I
could do nothing, indeed, I was doubtful whether I might sustain a bill, Judge Breckenridge, having in similar cases in this court, decided in favour of the City corporation—In these cases, however, the government was not a party, which, perhaps, would make a very different case. I will suggest in addition that it may be, the lot is inhansed in value by the extension of the street, and that the building was not worthy of repair.
I will act accordingly to your instructions.
I will use this occasion to request you to see a letter from M. Campbell, late attorney for this District to the Secretary of the Navy on the subject of a proceeding instituted by him in the Jackson Court of this District under the acts of Congress for the preservation of the live oak timber. The Secretary Suggests the opinion in reply that the case is not embraced by these acts, but refers him to you for advise

Unacquainted with the facts, and at a great distance from the place of their occurrences, I am compelled to refer you to Campbell's letter—In reference to an intimation of the Secretary's in the same letter, that if the proof be full an action of trover or some such action might be sustained, I have to say that, inasmuch as the persons are not now in the Territory that remedy is lost Very respectfully Your Ob.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE 26" Sept 1832</place-time>
<docbody>SIR A question of some interest is frequently presented in carrying in to effect the Act of Congress of the 5" of April last"—granting the right of preemption to actual settlers and housekeepers on the public lands, and on which I have deemed it proper to ask the direction of the Department.
The form of the Affidavit prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and to be taken by the claimants seem to apply only to cases where the claimants has lived and cultivated on the same tract of land. Such a construction of the Law would deprive two thirds of the actual settlers on the public Land previous to the 5" of April, of the right of preemption. It most frequently occurrs in this country that the settler builds his homes in the poor pine land for the advantages of Water and for air and cultivates land at some distance from his residence, which is productive but which would not answer for a settlement. When the land is surveyed he frequently finds his house and his field in different Sections Quarter Sections and townships.
His house is generally of little value, all his efforts and labour having been directed to the clearing of land and cultivating his Plantation.
The land on which he has lived with all the improvements he has put on it is not worth $1.25 per acre, and if he wishes to enter the land on which he has made his plantation he cannot take the oath that he was an actual settler and house keeper on that land, because his residence may have been in an entirely different section. In such cases it appears to me that the merit of the claim is no less than where the residence and cultivation has been all on the same eighth or

quarter sections. Where the claimant cannot secure both his house and his Plantation by entering two half eights of land it would seem to me to be within the spirit of the Law to allow him to make choice of either.
The enclosed affidavit presents such a case. The claimant could not to the oath prescribed by the regulations of the Department, and although his claim appears to us to be meritorious, we have thought it improper to allow him to make the entry until we shall receive your instructions on the subject. More than half of the cases presented are of this description, all of which will be suspended until your decision shall have been received by us. After you have decided you will please return the enclosed affidavit with your opinion on its merits."

R. BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, Your Several letters of 24" ult” ” and of the 15th 10 & 16th inst: " have been received.
I very much regret your indisposition, and that the circumstances connected with the duties of your Office which have grown out of Congressional legislation should be found among the reasons which have induced Mr Searcy to tender his resignation as Chief Clerk in your Office.
Mr Searcy States in his letter that after the returns due to this Office had been completed, the late law of Congress will cause them to be of no use.” He must allude to the Act of 5" April last,” and the necessity of minute Subdivisions of fractional Sections. The necessity for throwing aside those returns and making out new plats is not apparent without further explanations. Why may not the necessary Subdivisions be shewn on those plats?
With regard to the Subdivisions of fractional Sections in former Surveys, the case is different. Subdivisional plats will be necessary under those circumstances, & the labor of preparing them will be great.
On the 13" inst: you were written to respecting the arrears of your Office,” and were requested to make a report of the different duties to be performed, with an estimate of the number of Clerks &c which would be required to bring up the work in a given time.
I would now Suggest that the circumstances Set forth in your communication of the 24" August last, be made to constitute a part of your Report which will be Submitted to Congress at an early period of the approaching Session, when, I indulge a confident hope that the embarrassments existing in the Several Surveying Districts, and the injury which results to the public Service for want of adequate means to execute the requirements of law, will be fully & fairly investigated, and an adequate relief provided. Meanwhile I trust that Mr Searcy may be induced to continue to perform the duties of the Office as usual, * Printed also in A. S. P., Pub. Lands, VI, 535–536.

and as far as his health will permit, until the result of the intended application to Congress for relief Shall have been ascertained.
I am &c, E. HAYWARD.
P. S. In the midst of the constant pressure of details of business, the omission to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 23* May last," and the accompanying papers was not noticed until your letter of 24" ultimo mentioned the circumstance.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to transmit to you my Returns and accounts of the 3" Quarter of the present Year, for the Quarter Masters Dept.;
and the several Roads under my superintendence.
You will perceive in my Quarterly Return of Quarter Masters Stores, a number of articles that I have not turned over to the Quarter Master at Fort Marion on being relieved by him.

I did not do so, because I have in my possession a Return of property belonging to the Roads, made by Lt: Brown, which shews that those articles do not belong to the Quarter Masters Dept: (proper), but were purchased from Road funds, and improperly turned over to me by Lt. Burke, with the property of the Post, without distinguishing the one from the other.
As many of the articles are at present required on the Roads, I
have retained them in my possession to be applied to that service.
I commenced on the 1" of Sept: repairing the Road from Jacksonville to Alachua Court House, with the appropriation for the Road from St: Augustine to Tallahassee, agreeable to Your instructions,”

<docbody>To HON LEWIS CASS, Secretary of War Washington.—
SIR.—The situation which you occupy in the Government of the United States as chief of the War Department is my apology (if any is necessary) for addressing you this Letter, in which I shall call your attention to the frequent destruction of my property and the violation of my rights as a Citisen by the United States' troops stationed at this place under the Command of Major Jas M. Glassel.—Shortly after the arrival of the troops here, it was discovered that the Soldiers were killing the Cattle on the Island belonging to the Citisens, and at no very distant period from that time I had occular demonstration of the fact. Mr Antonio Giraldo and myself being owners of the principal part of the Stock on the Island went to Maj Glassel and made complaint, at the same time requesting that the Soldiers might be prohibited from hunting through the Island, which they were in the habit of doing daily. The answer received was that he could not think of depriving his Soldiers of the amusement of hunting as that was the only amusement they had.—
Since that time the Soldiers have continued the killing of Cattle on the Island, are permitted to carry Guns through the Island, and are frequently seen in the town at night with their Guns. In consequence of my complaints against the Soldiers, they have insulted me, in the most gross and infamous manner, so much so, that I have been compelled to use force in my own defence.—The commanding officer has distinctly said he cannot punish the Soldiers, and they evade the Laws not easily enforced. The Soldiers have violated the City regulations in the most barefaced and open manner, by shooting through the town day and night and have put at defiance the efforts of the Civil Authorities, and it is useless to complain to the Commanding Officer my property and that of other Citisens is wantonly destroyed and the Soldiers are still permitted to hunt and shoot through the Island at their pleasure and without restraint; and discipline is not kept up among them.
The Soldiers which were sent here to protect the Citisens and their property, instead of answering the intended purpose have become a nuisance on the Island in consequence of the absence of that discipline, which you Sir, will readily admit as a military man, is indispensable to keep men in order.—

744 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S I trust Sir, this application to you will not be disregarded, and that you will so instruct Maj Glassel as to prevent the necessity of any complaints, in future.—

<docbody>To the honorable the Senate and house of Representatives of the United States of America.
The Subscribers Citizens of Florida, respectfully represent, that they conceive it to be their duty, to solicit your attention, to the condition, (with a view to its improvement) of that part, of their Territory, which is watered by the Suwannee, and its tributary Streams.
This extensive region of Country, embracing a large portion of Middle and East Florida, as well as several of the lower lower Counties of Georgia, is dependant upon the Suwannee river, as a channel, through which, to convey its productions to market. However much the improvement of the navigation of this River, is to be desired by your petitioners, they are aware, that the claims of the general government, are greatly paramoun, to individual interests, in its consumation.
It is generally conceeded by those that have examined this part of the territory, after having explored other portions of it, that not an inconsiderable quantity of the finest Live Oak timber, of this territory, susceptible of being rendered valuable to the United States, lies upon this River. The land contiguous to the River, for seventy miles from its mouth, with but a small exception, has not been offered for sale, and consequently yet constitutes a part of the public domain; And how much this part of the territory being within the admitted limits of the admitted sugar region, would be enhanced in value, your petitioners leave for you to judge. The Cedar, yellow pine, and Cypress timber, bordering upon the river, and its vicinity, would be rendered valuable by the improvement of the navigation; but doubtless will continue valueless, without such facilities as a navigable stream, and a good inlet afford, in the transportation of naval Stores.
Whilst, several rivers of this Territory, of less note than than the Suwannee, have been carefully examined, and soundings of the several channels, through which they discharge themselves, taken and lade down, by the Corpse of Engineers sent by order of the government, to
446774-59-48

make out a chart of the Florida coast. This river was not examined with that [MS. torn] ntion which its importance in the class of Rivers in the Territory [MS. torn] mineted. Hence arises the doubt which exists of knowing correctly, what depth of water can be had at the bar. The Suwannee discharges itself through three channels. It is ascerted by those that have examined each of these passes, that one of them affords eight feet of water, From the soundings made by the by the Corpse Engineers only five and one half feet are given. It has been represented to your petitioners, that the channel examined by the Engineers is not the one, that affords the greatest depth of water.
Your petitioners are led to believe from the best information that can be obtained, that at a verry inconsiderable expense, important improvements might be made in the navigation of this River, which they beg leave to suggest. By excavating an oyster bar, and stoping two of the channels, the current of water would be forced through one Channel, which from the quantity of water and rapidity of the Current would verry soon wear a channel of sufficient depth for all the purposes required upon this River. There would then be, an uninterrupted navigation, for any vessel that could get in at the mouth for seventy miles up the River, at all stages of the water, and by removal of a small ledge of rock that extends across the river, the navigation would be good, for large port Boats, or Seamboats, up to the confluence of the Suwannee, and the Withlacoocha, thirty miles further, Sanguine as your petitoners are, in the belief, that the work is practicable, and that its costs would be more than doubly paid by the additional value which it would give to government land, Yet are they unwilling for the government to incur much expense without a certainty of an adeqaute good, Therefore ask, for a survey of the Suwannee River to be made (as early as may be convenient) with a view to its ultimate improvement and your petitioners in duty bound will ever pray.

<docbody>SIR, The people of the Territory I represent and especially the Spanish inhabitants are suffering greatly from the delay in the surveys of the private land claims.
For several years prior to the last Session of Congress appropriations were made for this object specifically but at the last Session of Congress the estimates were in gross and when interrogated the Commissioner of the General Land Office informed the Committee of

Ways and Means that the usual sum of ten thousand dollars was to be devoted to this service alone." The General Appropriation was made for surveys, in the unsuspecting confidence of Congress, that this paramount duty of the Government to Spanish grantees whose rights were guarranteed by Treaty would be respected and the funds applied in good faith to the purposes for which they were designed.
It has however inadvertently and incautiously conferred a discretion as to the application of the money which is likely not to be exercized for their benefit without your interpossition. It has been now Twelve years since the Treaty and ten years since a Board of Commissioners was organized to adjudicate these claims, and Six years since the confirmation of their Reports, and still the lands are not surveyed. In the Territory of Florida favorite Deputy Surveyors of lands have been engaged for years in the Surveys of pine woods at the enormous income of forty dollars per day whilst these Spanish grantees are deprived of the enjoyment of their property for the want of this necessary incident in the execution of the Treaty." For the last year the only answer that could be obtained from the Commissioner of the General Land Office was that Col. Butler the Surveyor General was sick and incapable of attending to business. I humbly submit to you how far this can be considered a valid excuse. The Deputies make the surveys and not the Surveyor General, and instructions for these Deputies could be prepared in the General Land Office, and the order given whether the Surveyor General was sick or well. I believe that many of the claims were surveyed and so badly executed that they would not pass inspection at the General Land Office when there was a competent draughtsman in it, and were returned. The Deputies ought either to have been sued upon their Official Bonds, or been compelled to resurvey the claims without further expense to the Government. However this may be, these surveys have been suspended for several years to the great injury of the owners of the land and detriment of the country generally in preventing its settlement and cultivation. I have seen from the

practice of four years in all the subordinate Offices of the Government that where there are general appropriations for Surveys of any kind, the Territories never receive any part. I trust however, that your Excellency will look into this subject, and give such order to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, or during the periods of his incapacity for business, to his chief clerk to issue an order for the survey of the private land claims in Florida.
I have the Honor to be Your mo ob. Servt.
JOS. M. WHITE

WASCISSA 30 Nov 32
SIR I addressed you on the 13 ul” * enclosing an agreement I had concluded with the Indian Chiefs Blunt & Davy *—At the same time

F L Q RIDA 7" E R R I TO R Y 753
I stated that Econchati Meco & Mulatto King, had declined by letter"
meeting me at the time & place designated or of negotiating on any terms for a removal west-
As Blunt however was of opinion that those chiefs had not expressed their real opinion, but had been operated upon by secret and adverse influences, and still deemed it advisable for me to attempt another interview with them, I concluded to embrace the occasion of paying off the annuity, when a general meeting of the chiefs & Warriors could be had without any extra expence to the mission on which I was engaged—Econchatimeco & Mulatto King however did not make their appearance at the place designated by the Agent of Indian affairs, and directed their Younger chiefs & Warriors not to go, or to receive the annuity due them, under a pretext that some plan was devised to entrap them into a cession of their land *—Some few however, in defiance of their authority did attend, and on hearing the talk I gave them, appeared much satisfied with it, declaring at the same time that the older chiefs had deceived them, and had not presented the views of their Father in Washington, in the light I had done—
They then enquired whether I would treat with as many of the Younger chiefs & Warriors, as might be desposed to emigrate, seperately from the Older chiefs or Head Men of the towns on the Appalachicola—Having no instructions however on this subject, and seeing a difficulty arrising from the fact that by the Treaty of Camp Moultrie the reservations are in the name of the chiefs Econchatimeco & Mulatto King, I could only reply that I had no doubt the President of the US would authorise some one, at the proper time, to enroll the names of those of Mulatto King & Econchatimecos Towns as were disposed to migrate, and to treat with them on equitable terms seperately from the head Chiefs, if they continued resolved not to remove—But that it was the wish of the President, as he was acting solely in this case for the benefit of his Red Children, that there should be no divisions among them—I recommended therefore that they should return to their Towns, state to the Head Chiefs their determination & what would be the consequence of a continued obstenate refusal on their part to acceede to the very advantageous terms offered them by the Government of the U States—In the mean while I suggested that two or more of the Younger Chiefs, in whose representation confidence might be reposed, should accompany Blunt's exploring party West, and that probably the accounts they might be able to

754 7" E R R H TO AP J A L PA P E R S give of the country on their return, might more favourably dispose the older men to migrate—Twenty four of the Younger Chiefs &
Warriors notwithstanding however, came as far as Tallahassee yesterday to seek an interview with me for the purpose of negotiating for their removal west, if the terms offered were acceptable—I declined however, for the reasons stated, entering into any seperate arrangements with them, and succeeded I believe in convincing them that the course I had recommended was the most judicious—Two or More of the Younger Chiefs will therefore accompany Blunts exploring party west, and on their return, I am satisfied, there will be little or no difficulty in making a satisfactory arrangement with Econchatimeco
& Mulatto King—
If not a majority certainly of the Younger Chiefs & Warriors of those Towns; Those who still retain their hunting habits, and who are most objectionable to the neighbouring white settlements, will treat for a removal, provided some one be authorised with full instructions, at the proper time, to conclude an arrangement—The terms on which I think a negotiation may be effected, will be similar to those agreed on with Blunt, with a proportional part of the value of the reservation abandoned to be paid to those who may migrate—In this event those who remain will have to be limited to their proportion of the land—
Whether I shall conduct this negotiation must depend upon the Executive of the U S & the confidence he may continue to repose in my ability faithfully to execute the trust refered in me—I have now closed my mission to the Seminole Indians, & have balanced my accounts with the Indian Department—The duty I trust has been discharged in a manner alike satisfactory to the President & yourself "

<docbody>SIR From constant sickness I have been unable to make out a report for October; which having occured, I now embrace it in my presentreport for November, of the operations of removing obstructions from the Harbour & River of St Marks * -

F L OR I. D A 7" E R R H TO R Y 755
The work has gone on well in the Harbour for these two months, although not so rapidly as I had expected: some time having unavoidably been lost in acquiring the best method for blasting the rock in the bed of the channel at the Devils Elbow. The plan adapted is to bore into the rock from above the water by having chissels attached to long poles, for 8 to 10 feet; for canisters of 4 inches diameter by
10 in length. When the canisters are charged, tubes one inch in diameter are attached to them of sufficient length to sink the canister & open above water. The hole bored above the canister is ramed with pounded stone and the canister fired by dropping into it a hot ball.—This mode of blasting has proved perfectly successful—each blast breaks up the stone for 10 or 12 feet around, so fine that the dredging machine will be sufficient to take up nearly the whole of it—More than half of the blasting is now completed—The work of M" Wyatt is progressing very slowly, and there is no probability of his complying with his contract," unless the time is extended a month to him to which I can see no objection The opening of the river progresses rapidly above the Nat. Bridge.
About five miles of it is already completed.

<docbody>SIR I have the honour to cover to your address with this my Summary Statement togather with Muster Roll and Report of Persons hired for the month of November.
I have also the Satisfaction to report to you that we have at length succeeded in opening Water Communication with Pelatka, our Depot on the St. Johns R. Sickness prevented me descending with the boat party as I had proposed, and Lieut Alden was consequently sent in my place. He succeeded in clearing all serious obstructions to boat navagation in the Ocklewaha during the present stage of its Waters—which is somewhat above its average height—and accomplished his trip, returning with a load, in Eighteen Days. The distance he estimates from 130 to 150 miles. With fortune in our favour we may calculate upon making our trips hereafter in, from
10 to 12 days. The banks of the Ocklewaha are however very low-frequently under water & thickly wooded. The navigation is consequently, constantly liable to be impeded from the falling in of trees. The boat which Capt. Graham has constructed *—for I have no claim to any credit there—is a fine Keel boat 55 ft in length by 8 in beam, with an ample and water-tight Cargo Box rising 4 ft above the Gunnels, effectually securing her entire load from the inclemencies of the weather. She is built entirely of Oak—is capable of carrying upwards of a hundred Barrels in bulk with ease—is propelled chiefly with poles, but, when the width of the river will admit, with oars;
and is effeciently manned with by a Skipper & Eight hands. She draws when loaded about 17 inches of water: the shoalest part of the navigation at the lowest stage of the Waters is 23 inches.
After various experiments on the limestone in our immediate vicinity I at length congratulated myself that I had found such as would yield lime suitable to the purposes of building. A few days since I burnt a kiln of it, but it produced poor stuff, of vastly inferior quality to several small specimens from the same rock that I had previously submitted to the action of fire. They obtain excellent lime, however, with eighteen miles of this post; and I am confident with a little more perseveance we shall be able to obtain it much nearer.
I had the honour to make application to the department, dated
4th Octr. for 5 Cast Iron Stoves. These are much wanted. There are no chimnies to the Soldiers barrack & we have no material for

constructing such with safety. The building is very large & the roof stands at a great distance from the ground, which prevents my making the experiment of a wooden chimney.
Having rec" no acknowledgement from your Office of the rect. of any of my Communications of later date than July, and knowing that some of my private letters have miscarried, I at times feel apprehensive least some of an Official Nature may have met with the like misfortune I am Sir, With very great respect Your Mo Obt Sert JOS W HARRIS Lieut A.

<docbody>SIR I beg leave to call your attention to the enclosed letter from one of the Claimants of the Arredondo grant confirmed at the last Session of the Supreme Court.
This appears to be a new species of nulification when a Deputy Surveyor presumes to set aside the decree of the Supreme Court. I
believe no office has ever been so inefficiently managed as the Surveyor's office in Florida. The complaint is universal among the Spanish grantees that they can not have their claims surveyed, but I have found that complaints are utterly unavailing I am &c JOS M WHITE

HON JOSEPH M. WHITE
DEAR SIR, In the affair of the Arredondo Grant we seem doomed to never ending difficulties with the Gen' Government. After waiting

F L Q R J D A 7" E R R H TO R Y 7.59
for Ten Years for a decision on the claim we have had to wait 8 months for the Mechanical Operation of a Survey, and finally I learn from Mr Levy who is on the Spot that the Deputy Surveyor is bent on removing the location of the grant near 7 miles from that adopted by the parties, from Paines town to the a Sink on the Great Prairie.
The effect of such a removal would be to exclude from the Grantees upwards of 10 M acres of the best hammoc lands to the South, besides a large quantity of first rate rolling pine land.
The location was made by the Grantees at the beginning, under circumstances of great notoriety, and which can be easily proved, that Paines town was always held and considered the Alachua proper so notorious indeed that the parties would have considered themselves acting erroniously had they located any where else. The parties, on locating, changed the name of Paines Town, in honor of the then existing Chief, to that of Micanopy, which is the indisputable centre of the grant.
The Deputy Surveyor, I am informed, urges as a reason for removing the location, that the term “Alachua” signifies literally a “Jug” and that he hence infers that as there is a Sink hole on the Great prairie which by analogy holds water as well as a jug, this must be the place referred to in the decree of the Supreme Court. But if analogical reasoning of this sort were permitted to be produced against our location, it can be easily refuted thus. That & het the Great Prairie has on it 3 Jugs in 3 different situations, and not only this, many other jugs or sinks surround Micanopy in almost every direction. The whole Country in fact of which Micanopy is in the middle may be termed a jug from the connected sheets of water which it contains in rainy seasons, and that this it was so considered by the Indians I had from one of them, Salms at Micanopy. I asked him to point to the place called Alachua, when he made a sweep with his arms indicating a general surface. The Surveyors reasoning therefore is a feeble analogy brought against absolute facts, that Paines Town or Micanopy was the Alachua proper at the time of location, and I take the liberty of mentioning the circumstances at this time under a hope that the land office may put a period to these protracted difficulties.
Our present plan is to protest in the event of the Surveyor persisting in changing the location.
I have not by me a copy of the record in this case, but I believe it shows distinctly enough that the location was properly made by the parties.
Very respectfully I am Dear Sir Your Obt Servi PETER MITCHEL

Both the Maps of Florida, Searcys and Tanners, shew Micanopy to be the centre of the grant and I trust that we have, altogether, enough of proof on our side should the conduct of the Surveyor render its production necessary, and I hope that next week will bring some conclusive account of his operation

<place-time>KEY WEST 14th Dec. 1832</place-time>
<docbody>SIR. On the 7" Inst. I received from you a copy of a letter from P. C. Greene to the Sec of War making various complaints against me as commandant of this post," and an order endorsed by you, that I should “report on its contents.”
Had I seen the letter merely as a letter from M. Greene, I should never have deigned to notice it, even in private conversation, coming from such a person. But inasmuch as it has been officially forwarded to me, it becomes my duty to report thereon te yet, and will endeavor to be as brief as I can, altho’ I apprehend that some details, which are necessary, may be tiresome to you.

As M. Green says, He & M" Giraldo called upon me one evening with information which induced a belief that two of the soldiers had that day killed a cow on the Island; I suggested the propriety of their being silent on the subject until I could ascertain who the offenders were: which I did the next day through the means of a confidential N. C. Officer, & sent word to them; they both came up
& found it to be one of M" Giraldo's. I promised him renumeration
& punishment to the individuals through a court martial: this was acquieced in, but from reasons that I could not learn, they were brought before the Grand jury, and thus the case was taken from my interference & martial law. On the complaint, M. Greene did say that I “must” keep the soldiers within the Cantonment & prohibit them from carrying arms: to which I possitively objected, even if it was in my power to carry such prohibition into effect.
The next case was M* Greene swearing before a magistrate that a named soldier had discharged his gun within the precincts of the Corporation: He was bound over & appeared before the district court; the jury without leaving the box acquitted him. The same soldier who had committed the above offences, soon afterwards shot another cow under charge of M. Browne of this place, which he stated to Mr Browne he did under a belief that it belonged to Mr Greene.
He was soon reported to me & I instantly confined him in irons, with a determination to turn him over to the civil authority & thus rid the service of such a disgrace to it. I repeatedly urged M. Browne to have him brought before the court: his reasons will appear in his note to me in answer to one of mine addressed to him to-day; and which is the only document I shall at present offer, altho' I can easily obtain more.
These are the only cases, on the subject matter of M* Green's complaint except that of want of discipline in the command which I freely acknowledge in part. With barely men sufficient to keep one centinel, it is impossible to keep them in their quarters at night;
and in a place like this where almost every third house is kept as a grog shop by the most depraved of men; the town filled with sailors from wrecked vessels & wreckers, and the principal part of the inhabitants free mulattoes from Nassau, the difficulty of keeping up regular discipline must at once occur to you.
However, every thing went on between M* Greene and myself as smoothly as could be with persons of such contra associations until the 8* Oct. (his letter to the Sec of War is dated 15* Oct.) when he wantonly attacked behind his back, & beat with a bludgeon one of my sergeants to such a degree that his life was much endangered: on seeing the man I immediately went to town & entered a prosecution

against him: a true bill was found by the grand jury but the judge had to adjourn the Court until May next for the want of a petit jury.
Hence the cause of his letter.
It is not my wish or disposition at any time to speak of the private character of any one; but in my present distant location from Government, I deem it only self defence to let them know something of M” Greene's character; for, as his clerk wrote the letter for him to the Sec of War, so might any vagabond hire a man to do the same office against me. I understand that M. Greene left his native state to defraud his creditors; left his family; got command of a Guineaman vessel in the slave trade for Havana; made money, & not daring to go home speculated on the lands in this place, the proprietors being much in want of funds: his wife & children in their native state, he has, ever since my arrival here, until very lately, lived in open concubinage with a black woman from Nassau, by whom he has children, and who left him in consequence of continued brutal treatment, during his fits of intoxication, which occur every afternoon.
I must now say that I was perfectly gratified by the manner in which the complaint was forwarded to me for my report thereon; but soon after its reception, some citizens from N. York stated that it was spoken of very freely, that, “P. C. Greene had preferred charges against me to the SecY of War.”
I am always ready to meet charges against me, & feel careless of the result: but really I cannot well bear, nor can I see the justice &
humanity of afflicting one's friends before he is known to be a culprit; or before he even dreams of it himself. I cannot for a moment believe that any individual in the Department ever intended to do me an injury; but the last circumstance stated has already had its effect, and may yet have a greater one. I could have wished that the affair had not been mentioned until I knew something of it.
The public try cases on the first report, without evidence, & make up their minds, which they have no wish to change.
I have the honor to be very Res” yr. Mo. Ob. S"

The Marshall and district attorney, are both absent from this plac and will not, in all probability, return before the adjournment (

I have conferred with Captain Chase of the Engineer whose science and experience is well known, as to the probable cos of a Brick building covered with slate, two stories high, plain, sub stantial, and combined together with a view to oeconomy, of sufficien dimensions for a Custom House and Court House, would cost abou Twelve thousand five hundred dollars.

<docbody>SIR. At the request of Col. White, Delegate from Florida I have made an examination of the Harbour of Apalachicola and an estimate of the cost of improving it which I here furnish you by his desire also—

768 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S You will see by the accompanying Sketch the nature of the improvements necessary for the convenience of the trade of the place.
The channel at present used for vessels to reach the town of Apalachicola is very circuitous, besides its being of a debth to admit vessels of light draught of water only. By it there is but about eight feet of water to the town. The natural channel for that branch of the river which runs by the town is that which follows a straight course to St. George's Sound, and has been obstructed by the sand which has been washed from the sand bank at the east of it by the winds
& storms from that direction. This obstruction has the appearance of being many years in forming, and from the fine & clay texture of the sand which lays perfectly hard, it would probably be many years more before the channel would fill up again if left to itself, should it now be opened. The filling up of the channel could be further prevented by obstructing the present channel for the escape of the water
& reflecting it into the one improved. This could well be done by a single row of piles across it driven 12 or 14 feet into the bottom &
securing their hea [MS torn] well together by strips tunneled on each side [of] them.
The trade of Apalachicola has increased to that extent which seems to claim this improvement from government, besides the importance of it in a Military point of view. Last year upwards of 16000 bales of cotton was shipped from the port of Apalachicola, and a proportionable quantity of goods imported, to the exports; besides great quantities of lumber, which is becoming a trade of considerable importance.
It was here that the transports of provisions were delayed several weeks at the risk of disasterous consequences during the campaign into the creek country—The U. States Arsinal is to be located about
180 miles up the Apalachicola River; and recently a contract for navy timber has been made for which a part of the supply is to be from the waters of this stream The following is an estimate of the cost of the improvement here suggested to be made— - Expense in replacing worn out parts of Machinery, repairs &c and removing to Apalachicola, the Machine
& boats used in St Marks Harbor . . . . . . . . . $1.200.00
Hire & feed of one overseer & six hands and wood for engine per day $11.80 No of days work to cut 800

<docbody>To the Honourable Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Citizens of St Augustine in East Florida respectfully presents;
That the celebrated Fort of St Marks which for a century afforded ample protection to the City of St. Augustine and secured the Province during that time to the Spanish sway is now rapidly delapidating and passing into ruin.
Immense sums of money have been expended in constructing this beautiful fabrick, and with the addition of some repairs it must remain what it ever has been a key to the possession of this Territory, and in the fortune of war will continue to exhaust the power & ingenuity of invaders Adjoining the Fort and stretching along in front of the City are the remains of a Sea-Wall which was found necessary to protect it from the violence of the Equinoctial storms. A considerable portion of this Wall was improvidently taken away shortly after the transfer of the Province to the United States to construct a wharf in front of the Barrck, for the use of the United States' Troops, leaving much property both publick and private exposed to inevitable ruin. The

770 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S safety of the citizens requires that this Wall should be rebuilt.—Since it has lain in this state many houses have been destroyed and whole lots overflowed. Under these circumstances such buildings as distance has hitherto secured must be eventually prostrated and their sites will hasten to form the bed of the River.
Your Memorialists with the liveliest feelings of necessity most respectfully solicit an appropriation for the rebuilding of the Sea-Wall and for the honour and interests of the country they also solicit the immediate repair of the Fort St Mark.”

<docbody>THE HONB° LOUIS M*LANE Secretary of the Treasury The Commissioner of the General Land Office to whom has been referred the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17*
ult° * which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to inform the House “what causes have prevented the survey of the private confirmed land claims in Florida, and whether any errors were made in the Surveys in West Florida which caused their return to the Surveyor General, and whether any instructions were given for the resurvey or proceedings instituted against the Deputies, & whether the United States have been or are charged with the re-survey out of the public treasury, and that he communicate the instructions given to the Surveyor General on the subject of the survey of the private claims,” has the honor to submit herewith copies of all the correspondence between the General Land Office and the Surveyor of the public lands in Florida, in relation to the survey of the private claims in that territory and the correction of certain errors in the surveys bordering on the River Escambia.”
From this correspondence it will be seen that the early attention of this office was drawn to the surveys of the private claims in Florida, and that every endeavour has been made by it to ensure the progress of that branch of the work with all the rapidity and accuracy possible.
It is apparent from an inspection of the township plats that under

these instructions a great many of the claims have been surveyed, but that there may be some claims in those townships which have not been surveyed is also probable, as notwithstanding every exertion has been made by the Department to induce the claimants to afford that information to the Deputy respecting the localities and boundaries of their claims, which could be furnished by themselves alone, it is apparent from the representations of the Surveyor General and his deputies, that in many cases the Claimants would not afford that information by which the Surveyor would have to be guided in the performance of his duty, and that he has been left entirely unassisted by the parties individually interested in his endeavours to survey their lands correctly—and it is very probable that some of the claims may not have been surveyed in consequence of the compensation allowed by law, being totally inadequate to the services required—This is the case in relation to Key West and to many claims in Louisiana.
Part of the Country between the Suwanee River and the Atlantic Ocean, in which there are private claims, is believed not to have yet been surveyed, and as the private claims have to be surveyed and numbered in connection with the public lands, there doubtless are claims there which have not been reported as surveyed, and plats of which cannot be returned to the proper Land Office until the Survey of the Township in which they are included, shall have been examined and approved by the Surveyor General.
That the delay in issuing patents for the private claims in Florida is in a great measure to be attributed to causes over which the Surveyor General has not a control is apparent from his letter of the 14"
January 1831 * in which he says “In the report you were kind enough to send, I find a remark under the head of Florida that many private claims have been surveyed, but no Certificates have been forwarded, which ought to have been received long since. I hope the delinquency was not intended to be applied to this Office, as I claim to have complied with the act of Congress on that subject, and under which the Register is required to forward Certificates for data to govern the issuing of the patents;” and from the fact of the Register of the Land Office at Tallahassee, having forwarded to this office about one hundred Certificates for those claims, but which in consequence of the defects therein I had to return to him during the last winter for correction—They have not been reforwarded to this office.
Some of the surveying of the swamps on the Escambia river proving erroneous the plats were returned to the Surveyor General for correction, but in consequence of the nature of the ground, of high waters

774 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S and of the sickness of the Deputies employed in that work, it was n until 11" April 1832 that the Surveyor General was enabled to repo the work as having been performed,” altho' the plats have not y reached this Office—all the correspondence on this subject will l found among the papers herewith transmitted.
In cases of errors in surveying the Deputies who executed the wor where it is not fully & satisfactorily proved that those errors hal arisen from causes which they could not control, are required to mal the requisite corrections without any compensation therefor—and :
by the letter of 26 October 1825, from the Surveyor General it appea that in all cases he has taken bonds from his Deputies with good an sufficient security in the sum of 10.000. Dollars for the correct ar faithful execution of their contracts,” any expense which may l incurred in correcting their work, will be re-imbursed by legal pr ceedings under those bonds—From an examination of the accoun of the Surveyor General which have been rendered to the 30" of Sep last, it does not appear that any charge is made therein for re-survey or corrections.
Part of the delay which occurred in reporting the Surveys to th Office has doubtless been occasioned by the long continued illness the Surveyor General and of the Clerks employed in his Office, ar at the date of the last letter from the Surveyor General he was sick as to prevent his attention to business.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

The Honb. Mr White, in his nullification letter of the 8th Dec'
ult,” charges “that the Deputy Surveyor presumes to set aside the decree of the Supreme Court,”—this charge, M White knows to be untrue. The great desire and anxiety of the claimants and their Agents, is to prevent, the Survey of the claim being made agreeably to the decree of the Supreme Court, and the best evidence which can be obtained as to the identity of the beginning point.
Attempts were at first made to confuse and embarrass the Surveyor, So as to have the Survey executed to Suit their own wishes and interest—not succeeding, other attempts of a more persuasive character were made—but the intelligence and Sterling integrity of M*
Washington, being more than they expected, their vexation and disappointment is to be vented upon me and the management of my office.
I will just remark, the better to understand men and their motives, that it is the impression and general understanding in this Country that M White has a contingent if not a fee simple interest in most of the large and litigated claims in the Territory.
Had this office been influenced alone by the interest of Col” White, no complaints would ever had been heard from that quarter about the
“inefficiency in the Management of the Surveyors Office of florida”—

Henry Washington to Robert Butler ALACHUA SAVANNA F. 16* Dec 1832
SIR, The case of Arredondo's Grant contrary to all expectat when I left Tallahassee, has been one of unusual difficulty to Surveyor—That its location is of great importance to the respect parties concerned, and one too of the most weighty, as well as most delicate responsibility to the Surveyor, must be admitted every one, who knows the nature of the case.—

Feeling this responsibility in all its force, and determined to fortify myself on substantial grounds, so as to be enabled to bid defiance to the clamours of interested men, and to execute impartial justice, it becomes necessary that the whole matter should be thoroughly investigated;—and to the best of my judgement, I have so far, had this investigation—
When I had the pleasure of last seeing you at your residence you seemed to think that there would not be much difficulty in the matter, for the impression then seemed to be that the Prairie (termed on the map the Alauchua Savanna) was the place known as Alachua, and coming within the meaning of the Decree of the Supreme Court of the United States, and that in the Survey it would be adopted as the place known as Alachua, inhabited in other times, by a tribe of Seminole Indians,—and this impression on my part, was strengthened by the statement of the most intelligent of the deputation of Seminole Indians now on an exploring expedition with Major Fagan" West of the Mississippi-On reaching Micinopa (the place where Edward M. Wanton lives) on the 22" of October last M. David Levy, Agent for those claiming under Arredondo, exhibited Sundry statements which he had collected relative the the “place known as Alachua, inhabited in other times by a tribe of Seminole Indians,” from which it appeared absolutely necessary as a Safe guard to strict justice, that there should be a thorough investigation of the matter.—I
thought it advisable again to call upon the Indians for further information respecting the “place known as Alachua, inhabited in other times, by a tribe of Seminole Indians”—A copy of their Statement is herewith enclosed—There appears to be strict coincidence between the Statement of the Indians given in a solemn manner in their Council house, and that given by the Delegation of Seminoles with Major Fagan—By their Statement it appears that the Alachua Savanna as now known by the White people, was known by them
“in other times,” as Alachua—and that the Indians for ten miles around were called Alachua Indians, because these Indians lived in the neighbourhood of the Alachua Savanna—It appears from this view which the Indians had of the settlements near the Alachua Savanna, that, the country or Territory of Alachua as known by the white people, must have taken its name from the Alachua Savanna—and more especially as Alachua is an Indian word-
After visiting the Seminole Indians at their council house, I determined to made enquiries, and obtain all the testimony I could from the old inhabitants of the country—and to satisfy myself thoroughly

it became necessary that I should visit distant parts of the country to see the different persons whose information was desired—I have obtained much useful information, and such as enables me to form a correct judgment on the matter—That I should have been much delayed in the investigation relative to the place of Alachua as known
“in other times” is readily accounted for, on a correct understanding of the difficulties presented in many respects.
From all the information which I have yet derived it does not appear that the Alachua Savanna was ever inhabited by Indians, but it does appear that the borders of said Savanna were settled in various directions, by Seminole Indians, and from reputable and disinterested men that the country known “in other times” as Alachua, derived its name from the Alachua Savanna, as known at this day, by the white People.
I have been anxious to obtain from the Agent of the Grants, M*
David Levy, all the written evidence upon which they based their location of the Arredondo Grant—but M* Levy refuses to grant my request unless I shall conform to his wishes in making the location!!!
This being the state of the case it appears that I have to rely upon other Sources of information—I shall forbear at present to animadvert upon the course pursued by M. David Levy and others interested.
Herewith you will receive a Copy taken from the Grant of Arredondo sent to me by M. David Levy, In surveying the claim of Arredondo a doubt exists with me, whether or not I am permitted to look into the Grant and lay aside the Decree of the Supreme Court of the United States.—Were I left at my discretion in the case, I
would start instantly to St Augustine and run the distance of 52
miles West, called for in said Grant. And there fix the location of the claim—The calls of the Grant would in my opinion, miss the Alachua Prairie 10 or 15, and perhaps 20 miles North—It appears that there was no survey made under the Spanish Government, or if surveyed there is no evidence of a survey so far as I can learn—M"
David Levy Says that there was no survey made by the Spanish Goverment directly—but that there was a survey made by M.
Vignoles who was employed by the Proprietors of the Grant for that purpose.
The Claimants under Arredondo, or their Agent it seems would be satisfied if the place where Wanton lives “known in other times” as Cuscowilla, or the place known as Painestown (which were said to have been Capital towns in their turn, of the Seminoles, at different Periods) was adopted as the central point of their Grant—but as I am strongly, very strongly supported in saying that Cuscawilla and Painestown were the appropriate and proper names of the Indian towns in the neighbourhood of the Alachua Savanna, I cannot from

F L Q R J D A 7" E R R H TO R Y 779
the evidence already taken, strengthened by the general understanding of the people living in the neighbourhood of the Grant, as well as elsewhere, where I have been in East Florida, for a moment believe that the towns of Cuscawilla and Painestown could be considered as Alachua towns, with more propriety than the neighbouring Indian towns: to wit Hogtown, Bowlesstown, Wacahootie, or any other town in the Territory of Alachua—With this view of the case I cannot perceive, how it could be possible in justice, to fix upon either of the towns mentioned as the Central point of the Grant of Arredondo—and that from the moment the Surveyor loses sight of the Alachua Savanna, he is left at his own discretion to adopt any Indian town which suits his pleasure, provided it be within the limits of the country “known as Alachua, inhabited in other times, by a tribe of Seminole Indians”—but confined to the Savanna, he would be bound to adopt it centre, as the Centre of the Grant—The centre of the country at large known as Alachua could not—in my Opinion be adopted, because I understand that there is no evidence in the Spanish Archieves recognizing an Indian boundary and it is very uncertain whether a regular Indian boundary could be defined—In the loss of such a guide in the present case, the Surveyor it seems to me, would have no alternative left other than to adopt the Alachua Savanna, or the Calls of Grant—The calls of the Grant in ordinary cases, supercede all other Calls, and particularly in cases of fraud in the original Survey—I consider the call of the course and distance of a line run upwards of 52 miles West of St Augustine, as a specific call, as much so as one of the actual Boundaries of a Survey—I hope you will pardon me for saying so much about the Grant.
The copy of the testimony herewith forwarded does not embrace all the testimony taken—I have not time to copy all, but from what is forwarded, you will be enabled to form an opinion of what I have been doing—The bearer of this communication, is a M. Knight living in this neighbourhood—I intended to have forwarded this letter by Mail, but Mr Knight wishes to go on to Tallahassee, I have thought it best to send this letter by him.
The people settled on the Alachua Grant seem to be very anxious for me to commence the Survey of Arredondo's Grant, in order that they may know their respective fates—but anxious to obtain the best information as regards the place of beginning, I was disposed to hazzard consequences in seeking this knowledge—and consequently keep the people in suspense, relative to the place of beginning very much to my regret. -
You will preceive by the deliberate statement furnished me by Edward M. Wanton in the presence of David Levy, and the subsequent testimony in the hand writing of the said Levy which is herewith

enclosed, that there is strong presumption in support of the opin when I say that I believe M. Wanton has been tampered with.
After a full and fair review of all the testimony taken if the Orig Grant of Arredondo's is thrown aside in making the surveythe surest guide left, I feel compelled to adopt the centre of the Alac Savanna as the centre of the Arredondo Grant, as approach nearest to the calls of the decree of the Supreme Court of the Un States. I propose running some Township lines near the Alac Savanna till I shall hear from you. And so soon as the bearer, Knight returns shall expect to commence the Survey of the A
dondo Grant. In the mean time if your judgement should point to you any directions or advice, it would be promptly attended With my best wishes for your health and prosperity—I rem with great respect Sir, Your Obt Serv"

which must, as near as may be, be placed in the middle of the Gra was, from all the evidence before me, anciently circumscribed the Seminole Settlements, and it is very evident that it is no ot than the very location that gave the name Alachua to that Sect of the Country; and hence no inconvenience from that source affect you any—If the claimants should be dissatisfied, they m only seek redress from the United States: you will, therefore, entir abide by the Decree of the Supreme Court of the United States, a immediately commence the survey without further hesitation, placing the Alachua Savanna in the Centre of said Grant.—This all the advice I can give you, and is no other than a repetition

my former instructions to you—My source of instructions is that of the Supreme Court of the United States, and consequently limited by their Decree.
Very respectfully yours &c ROB" BUTLER

Deposition by Harman H. Holliman *
[November 24, 1832]
In the fall of the Year 1821, I visited the neighborhood of Paines prarie in Company with Co” James Dell, & his two brothers, M & L.
Dell, & stoped at the house of Edw" M. Wanton, who then resided about one or two Miles in a Southern direction from Painestown &
about a Quarter of a mile NW. of what was termed at that time by the white people, Harrison Pond—We remained at Wanton's about two days, -M Wanton had two or three Small Cabins, having been recently built—and a large log house unfinished—We understood that Wanton was permitted by the Indians to make this establishment solely because he intended to erect a store house to trade with the Indians, & of its being understood by the Indians that he was a British and not a Spanish Subject, —We understood that M. Wanton, was, at that time a British Officer, under half pay from the English Government—during the time we were at Wanton's there was to have been a treaty held at Wantons, and Cap" Bell from S*Augustine was the Commissioner on the part of the United States, to treat with the Seminole Indians. The treaty with the Indians failed, as they did not make their appearance at the time and place appointed to hold the treaty—We did not think it safe to travel thro’, the neighborhood of Paines Prairie at the time we were there, nor had it been Considered Safe for white people to travel through that Country for Years previous to the fall of 1821, in Consequence of the hostility of the Indians. We were informed that the only Security we had at the time we were at Wanton's from Indian attack was in Consequence of the proposed treaty with the Indians, and that under no other pretext would we have been permitted to pass thro’ the Indian Settlement about Paines prairie unmolested—We heard of no other white settlement made near Paines prairie or Painestown by the white people, other than Wanton's previous to the fall of 1821, we passed a place called Oakhill, about two miles distant from Painestown, in a Northern direction when we Saw Several old Indian Camps or huts, but did

not discover, nor did we hear of any houses of any description, being built by White people at that place, or in the neighborhood of the Surrounding Country, other than those at Wanton's—We saw Horatio S. Dexter, at Wanton's who stated he was Concerned with Mr Wanton in the Store that M. Wanton was then building or about to erect—I left my residence on the S" Marys river, in the month of Feb 1822, in pursuit of two negroes who were taken by the Seminole Indians from my father (who was then living in Camden County Geo) in the Year 1818—I took water at the Cowford (now Known as Jacksonville) on the S" Johns river & ascended Said river, on my passage up the S" John's I stoped at a place on the Western bank of the river, Known as Paladka, where I remained one night—I there endeavored to procure an Indian Negro named John, as a guide and interpeter for the purpose of recovering the negroes taken by the Indians from my father—I failed in procuring the Services of this negro on account of his having a Sore foot—I found M. Woodruff, &
one or two other men employed whose names I do not recollect–
There was a Storehouse & two or three other houses built of logs which seemed to have been put up, Six or eight months previous to my visit at Paladka these houses were built at Paladka, and were occupied at the time I was there, one of which was inhabited at the time by M. Woodruff,-M Woodruff, informed me that the Storehouse was intended as a place of deposite, to Supply the New York Company with Supplies of previsions &c. for the purpose of enabling Said Company to form a Settlement West of St Johns river—He stated that we had explored the Oklawaha, & had found Some good lands on or about it, and further than this I do not recollect what was Stated by him, about the Settlement &c. The Indian negro John above alluded to was Said to have lived at or near Paladka, & to have been employed by the white people as a guide
& interpreter—After leaving Paladka, which was the latter part of February 1822, I continued my passage up the St Johns & met with an Indian negroe named Abram, on the eastern Shore of the S" John's, on his return from S" Augustine, home, at which time I employed him to go in pursuit of the Negroes taken by the Indians from my father, Abram returned in about twenty days from the Indian Territory, after I left him, with the negroes taken by the Indians, from my father, and during his absence I remained at a place Called Hope Hill, in the employment of M Levys manager, a Frenchman named Rotan, who employed me to assist in getting out a frame for a building. M. Davis, who was in Company with me in pursuit of Negroes, & had been from the time I left the St Marys, was likewise employed by Rotan till, Abram's return. There was

a Mechanic named William Cannowit whom we found at Hope Hill on our arrival & who informed me that he had been employed to put up the building for M" Levy—After I got the negroes M. Davis &
myself returned directly to the S" Marys—Hope hill is a Hammock bluff immediately on the Western Margin of the S" John's about ten Miles above Lake George by Water—M Levy, was represented to be a Jew, living in Charlestown S" Carolina.
I do solemnly Swear by the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God, that the foregoing Statement is Strictly true to the best of my Knowledge

HENRY WASHINGTON Deputy Surveyor Richard K. Call to Robert Butler TALLAHASSEE [December] 23” 1832–
DEAR SIR, The Bearer M Knight is from Alachua and will deliver you some documents from M Washington who you will perceive is much at a loss where to commence the Survey of the Alachua Grant.
The Claimants are desirous of taking at the centre, a place called Miconopa, when the Grant and the Decree of the Supreme Court calls for a place called Alachua. The difficulty is to ascertain what is the true centre of Alauchua.
The Grant was confirmed on the Testimony of W. T. Hall who says that in the month of November 1820 he with two men by the name of Smith and Lannam arrived at Alachua, and immediately proceeded to clear land and build houses. That they built two houses about one and a half miles east of Paynes old Town. These are the Houses which Washington says in the enclosed letter he is convinced were built at Pelatka on the St. John's River at least twenty five miles east of the land now claimed by Arredondo and Son.
Washington is desirous of receiving some instructions from you. He has taken great pains to inform himself correctly on the Subject, but he is yet greatly at a loss where to commence. Perhaps after seeing the papers you may be able to instruct him. I will come to see you as soon as I have time.

<place-time>ST: AUGUSTINE E F January 4” 1832. [1833]</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I herewith enclose to you a Contract with Messrs Russ, Roche, Merlet & Crews to repair the Road from Tallahassee to Pensacola,”
in which you will perceive I have directed the repairs to be made to the Road commencing at Tallahassee and following the direction through Quincy, Marianna and Webbville to Oak Hill, which is the place referred to in your letter of the 3" of August 1832.”
Your letter of the 6* November * reached this place during my absence on a tour of inspection to the Road from Tallahassee to Pensacola, and was not received until my return—the enclosed contract had then been concluded.
In the last paragraph of that letter, you direct that I shall not be at liberty to depart from the course of the Military Road, and enclose an estimate made by Capt. Shannon which formed the basis of the appropriation, by comparing that estimate with the Contract, you will perceive that the route I have taken is precisely the same as that which is estimated for by Capt Shannon.
This Road is called the upper route, in travelling from Pensacola to Tallahassee, it leaves the Military Road a few miles east of the Choctahachy River, passes through Holmes' Valley, Oak Hill, Webbville, Marianna, crosses the Appalachee at the junction of the Flint and Chatahooche Rivers, thence through Quincy and enters into the Military Road about eight miles west of Tallahassee, which is a distance of about ninety miles.
The upper road passes through a rich and well settled country and is the route now in general use, as the Military Road (from information) is scarcely perceptible in many parts, in consequence of its passing through a poor and unsettled country.
I was induced to deviate from that portion of the Military Road, by your reference to the other in your letter of the 3" of August, and the fact of Capt: Shannon's having already done so and repaired as far as Oak Hill.
I forward the enclosed letters for your consideration and decision, and have informed the Contractors that as I have not the authority to alter the Contract, the subject has been referred to you.”

David B. Macomb to John L'Engle MARIANNA December 4th 1832
SIR On my journey from Pensacola to this place, I met with Doctor Crews who informed me that he had in conjunction with others been appointed by you to carry into effect the Act of Congress granting an appropriation of $4000 to repair the road from Tallahassee to Pensacola." I have been appointed the Mail contractor by the Post Master General, to convey the mail from Tallahassee to Pensacola in Stages and Steam Boat, and it occured to me that as the appropriation was made by Congress to facilitate the transportation of the U. S. Mail on that route I suggested the policy to him of confining the repairs to only so much of the route as the Mail must necessarily pass over, more particularly as the present route by means of Steam Boat and Stages, at the time of the passage of the law was not thought of. It appears that the part of the road on the west of the Choctahachy river can never be rendered by any amount of repairs a good and permanent road, in as much as the bridges over the swamps, will always as has ever proved to be the case be washed away by the freshets and consequently any money laid out on the repair of this part of the road must necessarily be thrown away. The road as it now is, on the west side of the Choctahachy River is, sufficiently good in its natural state for all neighbourhood purposes, and as the mail is never any more to pass over that road there will be no necessity to lay out any part of that appropriation upon it, which was intended and granted solely and exclusively for the benefit and repair of that road over which the mail would be transported. I have taken the liberty to suggest to D* Crews the policy of refering the subject back to you and with his consent &
request have written to you on the subject. It appears that the contracting parties are perfectly willing to change the terms of the contract and act up to the spirit of the law of Congress The Steam Boat has ascended up the Chocktahachy River as far as Cedar Bluff about 2% miles from the Cowford, and a road can be cut from

788 TER R1 to RIAL PAPERS thence to Col: Brights or Col: Russ a distance of 15 miles which will render the transportation at all times certain & by means of the Steam Boat more rapid & convenient. It appears also that all the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring section of county are all in favor of the change since the arrival of the Steam Boat at the point above mentioned & the interests of the county generally would be thoroughly subserved thereby.

MY DEAR SIR You will no doubt receive the communication of Col: David B M*Comb at the same time that this will come to hand.
The Statement contained in that letter will I think convince you of the propriety of adopting the course he has so judiciously suggested, It is only 12 or 14 miles below the road cut by Capt: Shannon to Cedar Bluff, where the steam boat will land—so that the ballance of the road to Deer Point near Pensacola will be of no use at all, and to repair the road or swamp on the west side of the Chocktahachy River is wholly impracticable, as it is subject to be inundated whenever the river is the least up and all the Bridges causeways &c would be washed away in all probability in ten days after they are made The distance from the Chocktahachy River to Oak Hill is about

DEAR SIR In accordance with a wish of Doctor Crews, I beg leave to give my views relative to the improvements to be put on the road to Pensacola. The Steam Boat Col: M*Comb informs me, will come up as far as Cedar Bluff, it not being practicable at present to proceed further: The road at present the other side of Masters Russ I understand is sufficiently good for neighbourhood purposes, and as the object of the present appropriation is to create facilities for the transportation of the mail & travellers, I think that object will be better gained by cutting a new road from Russ' Cedar Blufl, than to expend all the appropriation on the road from Russ' to Pensacola;
indeed from my own observation, I entertain not the slightest doubt
'twould require twice the present amount appropriated to put that road in repair: If consistent with your ideas of utility & propriety the course suggested is adopted I presume the object of the appropriation will be gained: Accept my assurances of respect & consideration Yr Obt Sert Signed GEORGES HAWKINS

SIR From the above" (which is a true copy of a letter from the Department to me) you will see that the object of the Department is to have a quick mail through Florida which is to run from Tallahassee Flor to Blakely Ala, via Pensacola in 67 hours a distance of

790 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E H S Holmes Valley to Pensacola so that a stage can be run at all seasons of the year, in three or four miles of the road through Chocktahatchy Swamp it will require at least 30 bridges—the Steam Boat is now in operation, transporting the mail & passengers up the Chocktahatchy River to Cedar Bluff 10 or 15 miles below Shannons Road (finding it impossible to run any further up) Now this being the case I would suggest that a deviation be made from Shannons road, say leave said road near Maj Langs in Holmes Valley about 9 miles East of Chocktahatchy & run a direct course from thence to Cedar Bluff the Steam Boat landing, a distance of about 15 miles through a pinebarren which will cost a mere trifle which is the only place where the stages can cooperate with the Steam Boat—If you should adopt the above plan & expend the appropriation on the road from Tallahassee to Cedar Bluff we then should have a first rate road from Tallahassee to the Steam Boat landing—I would further observe that the road west of Chocktahatchy has never been, nor will ever be of any account for running the mail (as the little travel that passes west takes the upper route) which will now become useless for that object under the present plan for running the mail from Holmes Walley to Pensacola Respectfully Your Obt Servt Signed SAMUEL STOWERS

I would suggest that the deviation should commence at Dinnards a few miles still further East, by which it will shorten the distance the road much better and will cost less to make it SSTOWERS Mail contractor on the route from Tallahassee to Pensacola

And first the principal part of our lands are verry poor pine Barron, (as commonly called) and the good land or oak and hickory land, in small detachments bordered by good pine land. it has happened that the sixteenth Sections in no one instance has faild to fall in the poor And un cultivated pine land, with only one exception viz the 16"
section Ranange 14 township 1 east of the meridian and North of the Base Line which said section is poor pine land thoug cultivated.
Secondly the principal part of our population is poor farming men and stand in kneed of aid to educate their children and under those circumstances are deprived of those advantages which we have no dubt was intended for them for third and lastly we donot believe that the general Goverment intended to bestow a useless gift when the sixteenth section in each township was donated to benefit of literature and learning among the poor and destitute.
Having thus short and simply stated the grounds of this presentment of our grievance in this particular. we beg leave to point out the remedy we desire, which is for the goverment of the United States to grant the county courts privilege to select any one section in each township (of Land that has been offered) out of the unsold land with this restriction allso not to interfear with an individual improvement with out his or her consent.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE Jan' 9" 1833</place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR, Your favor of 18" ulti has been received, with its enclosure which I have handed over to the individual to whom it was directed.
You enquire “if there is any prospect of doing any thing in the Gen” affairs in Florida.” In consequence of the appalling stagnation in business of every description in our Country, and especially in Selling lands, owing cheifly to the sickness of the last two years, I have not been able to effect any sales at prices, which in justice to Gen Lafayette and good faith to you, I could think of accepting—
I have had some offers for lands which three years ago could readily have been sold for one hundred per cent more than has been offered;
the value of landed property is now at its lowest ebb, and sales made or forced at this time, must be at an entire sacrafice.
The flattering prospects of health the ensuing year, and the rise in the article of cotton from 8 cts for the crop of last year, to 10" for the present Crop, will, we anticipate, greatly increase the demand for good land, and consequently enhance the prices.
I wrote you last July, in detail, in regard to the conditional arrangement of affairs with the french settlers, and requested you would immediately forward my letter to Gen L. and desire of him an early anSWer.
The terms of the sale to the settlers were based upon their expartee statements of verbal contracts which they alledge to have made with the General, our contracts were of course made subject to the approval of Gen Lafayette. The price agreed upon for the land would have been considered high in the best of times, but the time, and partial payments, in advance, which they charge to have been made, I could not consent to, as there was no evidence in my possession that authorised me to admit either. Every fact was given minutely and
446774-59–51

at length in my letter to Gen L. that no misunderstanding should exist, and we have been in anxious expectancy of his answer. When I had the honor of receiving my appointment from you, I found a charge against the land for taxes of $493, and the tax collector about to advertise it for the payment of them, I had necessarily to advance the money at once to avoid further expense, and be assured, I will not sell lands for less than I think them worth, merely to reimburse myself. -
Immediately after the receipt of my authority, I investigated the sales made by M. Graham, with the consent of Gen Lafayette, to Mess Doyle & Caruthers, being 160 acres to each, and discovered an error in the deed to the latter, which conveyed a quarter in a adjoining town, when the land sold and intended to be conveyed was % of a mile off—Mr Caruthers it seems bought at $4 pracre, whilst for the tract conveyed I should refuse less than $10, as the quarter immediately adjoining was sold to Mr Doyle for that sum cash; I have succeeded in getting the first deed cancelled, and have given a new one for the tract actually sold.
I have recently had an application, by letter, from Gov Branch, to buy one section of land; in consequence of the relationship existing between us, I declined selling to him on any terms, but advised him to apply to you on the subject, and propose that you get two or more disinterested persons to value the land, and if both parties should be satisfied with the price that may be agreed upon, let the sale be Consumated by you, or by myself under instructions from you.

<docbody>Sir In order to prevent the necessity of my making another report by order of the War Dep. I deem it adviseable to forestall it by enclosing to you a copy of a correspondence with M. Greene of this place.—
One of the soldiers was enticed by a man named Harris to desert;
he went for the purpose into a boat belonging to the sheriff, of which Harris had charge. The sheriff was informed of it, went with a party took him out, stripped, tied & whipped his back almost to a jelly.—When brought up here I went to see him, & told him he had nothing more than his deserts for an attempt to run off—The soldiers however, as it appears were much exasperated & went into town the succeeding night under a concerted & deliberate plan to catch the sherif as well as Harris who chastised the man.—the latter they found in a grog shop and inflicted punishment on him; the sheriff made his escape. I was sick at the time and heard nothing of the transaction until late the ensuing morning: when I directed such steps to be taken as to prevent if possible a recurrence of such another affair. I
understand that, altho there was much alarm in town, no person was further insulted than giving them a positive order to keep off & not interfere. I must say here, that since it has happened without my knowledge and that I am bound to use my endeavors to prevent its going further; I do regret that, whilst they were at it, they had not met the sheriff who flogged a man without any hearing.

SIR.—I take this method of respectfully reporting to you, that an armed party of the soldiers under your command, headed by a non commissioned officer, came into town last evening for the avowed object of assaulting some of the Citizens.—Indeed the officer was heard by several to order all citizens whom they met to be attacked.—
A proceeding so violent has created a great excitement among the Citizens many of whom from the fear of its recurrence have applied to me as the senior Militia officer of this County for protection.
Confident that an investigation by you of this affair, will ensure them the security they seek, I shall take no steps in my official capacity until I hear from you on the subject.

SIR, By Mr Prior I received your communication of the 8"—Indisposition, from which I have not yet entirely recovered, prevented my answer until this time: and indeed I have not yet been able to investigate the facts as far as I could wish. The only two individuals that I could learn had committed an overt act in the case, I ordered to be instantly confined, where they shall remain until I can see farther into the subject; & I hope to find a correspondent manifestation on the part of the civil authorities to preserve peace by an energetic execution of their own laws.
It is well known to all that I am unable, by my restricted force, to form a cordon of sentinels around the quarters so as to prevent the soldiers from going out at night: It is equally well known that men in their situation will resort to the grog shops for exhiliration; and it is as well known that with few exceptions, your grog sellers will make a soldier beastly drunk, provided he receives the money in hand, or had previously received a full equivalent in labour. Under such circumstances what can be expected—I submit this for your consideration as well as for the consideration of the “many” whose fears—
you say—had induced them to apply to you as senior militia officer of the County; but I would further ask what civil officer, or citizen, 

except in the cases of Mr Prior & Mr Weaver, have ever brought to justice a man for vending ardent spirits to soldiers in the face of Territorial & City laws? I believe there are none on record.
I would now ask whether your City authorities are sunk so low as to permit a petty sheriff of an hours or a day's standing, to assume the office of Dictator & take a man, have him tied, stripped & scourged almost to a jelly, merely because he was in a passion, & the man had no person to protect him: and this even without a hearing of his case, nor any application to a civil Magistrate? No person could wonder at the result: I only wonder that the sheriff did not come into the affray as I understand he was quite stout hearted the ensuing morning
& for marching up here.—
I submit the foregoing to you sir, for your calm consideration &
with no intention of reflecting on yourself, to whom I feel thankful for the manner in which you addressed me your note of the 8th Inst.
I am Sir Very Respy Yo Mo Obt St J. M. GLASSELL Major Comm”

P.S.. I shall certainly endeavour to prevent a recurrence of the scenes that took place on the 7" but cannot be answerable for consequences if such another outrage should be perpetrated as was by the Sheriff. The Soldier who inflicted the blows on the man is a sober, quiet, but deliberate & firm man. I have no doubt but that some of the N. C. officers were nearly present at the transaction &
encouraged it, but cannot tell who they were to a certainty—J.M.G.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your letter of the 19 ulto" and to express my gratification on the approval by the President & yourself of the manner in which I have executed the duties entrusted to me—Blunts party left the Appalachicola some weeks since on their explorations west, and were accompanied by two or three of the Younger chiefs of Mulatto King, & Econchatimeco's Town—On their return I will seek an early opportunity of renewing my negotiations with those chiefs for the removal of themselves &
followers west; and should they then decline, I will proceed to the enrollment of the Younger Chiefs & Warriors who may be disposed to migrate on the terms suggested & approved in my previous communication to you—In the mean time I would draw your attention to the additional article of the Treaty of Camp Moultrie, with a view of ascertaining your opinion whether the terms of that article would recognise a division of the reservations of land between the old Chiefs
& those preferring to remain with them; & those Younger chiefs &
Warriors who may be disposed to migrate on receiving payment for the proportional part allotted them—In the several communications held with them, I have rather encouraged the probability of such an arrangement, in addition to each Chief & Warrior enrolled, receiving in advance their proportion of the annuity under the Treaty of Camp Moultrie & a commutation in money for their expenses of removal subsistence &c &c, as was allowed in the agreement with Blunt The division of land, if made, would have to be graduated, I should suppose, according to the rank & consequence of the Chiefs
& Warriors, as has been the practice in the distribution of the annuity—Indeed that distribution may be the standard of the land apportionment, as it has been long recognised by the Indians—An idea however prevails among the Younger Chiefs & Warriors disposed to migrate & composing a decided majority of the Towns, that they may in council depose the Old Chiefs Mulatto & Econchatimeco, and thus have the authority themselves of selling the reservations &
forcing these older chiefs, reduced to the station of subjects, to migrate with them—This movement has been agitated in their private meetings, but in consultations with me I have discountenanced it;
believing it to be the wish of the Executive of the US, not to encourage divisions among his Red Men, but rather to convince by argument that the policy of the General Government in removing them west originated in the most humane feelings for their happiness & future

preservation—No other language have I held in all my negotiations with the Florida Indians & I have the satisfaction to state that the appeal when properly interpreted & fairly comprehended, has never been without its effect The difficulties encountered thus far with the Appalachicola bands, two of them at least, may be ascribed to the force of secret and interested influences, but these are in a fair way of being properly understood by the Indians themselves, who in having the film removed from their eyes will not be slow in understanding their real interests & in recognising their true friends Your Ob Serv JAMES GADSDEN

<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and house of Representatives of the United States.
The Petition of the undersigned Citizens of the Territory of Florida respectfully sheweth, that for several years past the legislation of the said Territory has been calculated materially to disturb the peace and happiness and to injure the property of the ceded inhabitants of the late provinces of Spain who are by the Treaty now Citizens of the United States. Your Petitioners are aware that the evils of which they complain have not arrisen from any thing inherent in the institutions and Laws of the United States, but have their origin in the illiberal prejudices of a local government totally at variance with the liberal spirit and generous policy of the nation and age in which we live: it will not be necessary for us in appealing to so intelligent a body as the one we address, to say that every nation and people have particular customs and habits which if not at War with the institutions of other countries are universally viewed with great toleration and indulgence. This principle has been carried so far in other countries where there was an established religion that the ceded inhabi-

tants were permitted to retain theirs. There are doubtless some practises in all countries tolerated by National indulgencies that may not be approved by all the people of the United States; but those are diseases of the body politic to be changed by example and public sentiment and not by the nostrums of political quackery which will nauseate and disgust every one whose misfortune it has been to be transfered to the United States.
The laws to which your Memorialists chiefly object as coming under the designation above mentioned are mostly those of the last Session of Council relating to free people of color: it cannot have escaped the observation of your honorable body that in all slaveholding countries some portion of the population and not a very inconsiderable part have without the formalities of Marriage ceremonies, children by colored women. in all Spanish countries they were free and admitted to most of the rights of Spanish subjects especially to the natural and inherent right of legal protection from which they are now excluded: however these practises may be at variance with the national prejudices of a portion of the United States they existed in the recently aquired country and are not to be extinguished at once by intolerance and persecution or any other moral or political fanaticisim: These evils are not to be rooted out by legal penalties any more than faith is to be controuled by the terrors of the Inqusition and a resort to the one is no more to be justified than to the other. The Legislative Council of Florida however acting upon the idea of bringing every thing to their own standard of moral perfection: as the Tyrant of antiquity did to His bed, have denounced penalties and imposed taxes on this class of population only on account of their color: These unfortunate people are not only required to pay the usual taxes which other citizens pay but they are required to pay from five to ten dollars each on both sexes over fifteen years of age because of their color, in addition, and to be sold as slaves for life if they should be too poor to pay these odious and unequal taxes;
besides being outlawed and excluded from all legal redress for injuries done either to their persons or properties: connected with this also is a law to break up all those paternal obligations and ties of natural affection which have existed for years past by imposing a fine of one thousand dollars with the penalty of disfranchisement upon every White person who is suspected of having a connexion with a coloured woman and the like penalty for inter-marying with any person suspected to be of colored origin or for performing such ceremony.
The Legislative Acts of Florida are now replete with many cruel and unjust laws but those of mental persecution and proscription for the virtuous and sacred ties of domestic life and parental affection

are certainly the most tyranical and the most repugnant to the free institutions of our republican government and perfect novelties in moderen legislation.
Your Memorialists therefore humbly pray that all those cruel, unnecessary and most impolitic laws not authorised by the Constitution of the United States be repealed and annulled and your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray &"

[Enclosure]
Protest of Proprietors of the Arredondo Grant
(Copy) [January 6, 1833]
TERRITORY OF FLORIDA County of Alachua The protest of the Proprietors of the Alachua or Arredondo Grant sheweth; Whereas that by virtue of a Grant duly made by the Government of Spain, through their properly constituted Agents to F. M. Arredondo & Son under date of 22 December 1817, they the said Arredondos were invested with a full and absolute title of property in and to a certain tract of Land containing 289.645% acres of English measurement, located in the District of Country called Alachua towards the centre of which tract (according to the terms of

the grant) is the place known by the name of Alachua which was formerly inhabited by a tribe of Seminole Indians, who abandoned it, That by provision of the Treaty of Amity, Settlement & Limits, entered into between the United States of America and His Catholic Majesty, and concluded at Washington in the 22” February 1821,”
it was engaged on the part of the United States in the 8" Article of said Treaty, that all grants of Land, made before a certain date, and by sufficient authority in the Territories by that Treaty ceded to the United States “should remain confirmed to the proprietors in the same manner as they would, if the Territories had remained under the dominion of His Catholic Majesty.” That in pursuance of said provision and under and by virtue of the Authority of certain Acts of the Congress of the United States passed for the purpose of carrying into Execution the requisitions of the 8* Article aforesaid of said Treaty, a final decree was made in the Supreme Court of the United States at its term of Session for the year 1832, and entered upon the Record of said Court as of the 17* March 1832* Confirming unto the claimants and proprietors of said grant so above stated to have been to the Arredondos, their legal and Equitable rights and title in and to the property and possession of the tract of Land by them claimed to have been vested by the terms of said Grant, the centre whereof was adjudged in said decree to be the same as that which in said grant was designated and described to be such centre. That by force of testimony connected with the history and topography of the country in which said grant is situated, supported and made clear by the testimony of all the old Inhabitants of the Country it is settled conclusively and demonstratively that the place formerly Known as the town of Alachua “inhabited in other times as the Chief or Capital town of the Seminole Nation of Indians, and at the present day Known by the name of Micanopa, was the place evidently by the terms and phraseology of the grant, contemplated by it to be such central point, and was consequently the same place intended by the decree of the Supreme Court aforesaid to be fixed upon as such; but that nevertheless, disregarding the strict right of the owners of said tract, the Surveyor deputed on behalf of the United States to execute the intention of the decree aforesaid by locating said tract in conformity to the terms of the grant, and separating it from the public demain, hath made Known an intention to adopt as the central point of said grant a place different and distant from the true centre as above described: Now therefore the Proprietors and owners as aforesaid of the grant aforesaid holding it as evident that the place above stated

by them to be the centre of their grant aforesaid is indeed the only true centre, and that therefore the selection of any other place than that above described as such centre would be in direct and palpable violation of the true intent and meaning of the terms of the grant by which said property was originally vested in the grantees; and in equal violation of the like intent and meaning of the decree of the Supreme Court by which as aforesaid, said grant has been confirmed as valid to the claimants; that it would be, as they think, unsupported and unwarranted by any admissible testimony or ground of Justification whatever, and would operate injuriously to the owners of said grant, to which they cannot in Justice to themselves yield their consent, do hereby positively absolutely, and unequivocally object to such proceeding of the said Surveyor, and declare that they will not consent to the adoption of any other place as the centre of their grant save the single one aforementioned, which, as seems clear to them, is the only true and proper one, earnestly protesting as they do hereby protest against any attempt to proceed in a survey of said tract which does not start from said place abovementioned as a centre, declaring that any such attempt will be considered a departure from the authority by which the Surveyor would undertake to enter upon and survey said grant, and that therefore any and all proceedings had in prosecution of such Illegal Attempt will be deemed and held to be an intrusion;
and that no survey of any tract by said Surveyor made, differing from that which in these premises is stated to be in the opinion of the proprietors the proper one, will be at all assented to or concured in, but will be wholly rejected as Illegal and unauthorised; hereby cautioning said Surveyor that in any proceeding on his part by which he shall attempt to prosecute a survey so herein above objected to, he will be acting in his own wrong and at his own risk.

On the 10" Ult” you referred to this office a letter from said White,"
enclosing one from Peter Mitchel on the subject of this claim, in which M White alleges that the Deputy Suveyor charged with surveying the tract “presumes to set aside the decree of the Supreme Court”. Copies of these letters were forwarded to Col° Butler the Surveyor General, on the 17* last month," with directions to report thereon as soon as practicable. See annexed papers, marked B & C.
Since then Col” Butler has made a full report to the Department,”
which you have referred to this Office, of all matters having any bearing on the charge preferred by M.

See paper marked D. with the documents annexed N° 1. 2. 3. 4.5"

The amount above the available funds for this work, as near as I can estimate will be $1500.00 wich could be expended to the best advantage if it could be obtained at the present session of congress: either to have the work done this season, should the state of the river allow, or to effect it early next fall which would answer all the purposes of the improvement I have been some time apprehensive that more money would be necessary for this work, but until the present I have thought that I
could effect the object with the means now at command. This is my apology for asking, at this late period a further appropriation of

<docbody>Whereas the river Oscilla runs through one of the most fertile portions of Florida, and also into two Counties of the State of Georgia, but in consequence of the obstructions to the navigation of said river

at and above the natural bridge, the public lands contiguous to said river are rendered of much less value than they would be were said obstructions removed; and in consequence a great portion of the same have been unsold, and yet remain the property of the U. S.–
And whereas the settlement, growth and property of the Territory is thereby greatly retarded; and whereas upon a survey of said river by an Engineer of the U.S: it has been estimated that the obstruction at the natural bridge could be removed by the judicious expenditure of ten thousand dollars—And whereas in consequence of the General Government being the principal proprietor of the property which will be benefitted by said work, it is considered that Congress should make the necessary appropriation for the same—And whereas the people of the Territory memoralized Congress at its last Session for such aid (the same being transmitted to the Delegate from Florida for presentation) and as it is highly important to the Citizens, resident contiguous to said river, that such improvements in the navigation should be made as early as possible.—

<docbody>SIR You are already apprised that the suit of Mitchel & others against the U. States, which involves the title to a very large tract of land in the Territory of Florida, stands for argument at the present term of the Supreme Court—and that there are also several cases from Missouri founded upon alledged grants or concessions from the Spanish authorities.—It has been supposed that there are original official papers in possession of the Colonial authorities of Cuba which would probably throw light on claims of this description & assist the Court in coming to a just conclusion.—Will you have the goodness to say whether it is probable that these papers will be obtained by the Government before the next Term of the Supreme Court and whether the dispatches from our agent at Havanna furnish sufficient grounds for believing, that the papers yet to be delivered may affect materially the decision on the claim of Mitchell & others—I make it therefore my duty to ask for a continuance of the case *
I am Sir very respectfully yr. Obt. St.

<docbody>SIR. In my last report to you I stated the circumstance of Wyatt's having abandoned the work he contracted to do at the Nat. Bridge on the St Marks River and that I had considered that he had forfeited all claims to any remuneration for what he had done *—He now pretends that he was preparing to complete the entire work and asks pay for the work done in proportion to what he would have received if he had completed the whole. Norwithstanding Wyatt's unsatis-

factory conduct in this affair I am constraned to think that such allowance might be made to him, but which I shall not make with the previous sanction of the Department. I feel no desire, and think my feelings accord with yours in such matters, to enfo rigidly the strict rules of contracts with contractors where no inju has been sustained to the Government. I refer the matter to y decision"

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNC</dochead>
<source>[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council Journal:Pr.]</source>
<place-time>[February 17, 1833</place-time>
<docbody>Mr. Bradford offered the following memorial and resolution.
The memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Flori to the Congress of the United States, respectfully represents:
That your memoralists feel great pleasure and satisfaction, at near approach of that desirable and happy period in our governme when the public debt will all have been paid, and those means wh have been pledged for its redemption, will be at the disposition of government, to be applied to other objects, while this debt, wh was created in defence of the just rights of this government exist your memoralists were unwilling to urge the disposition of any of means which were pledged for its payment, notwithstanding peculiar situation of this territory, might have authorized them to so, now that this debt is all paid but a small balance, and ampleme:
are provided for that, and as the subject of disposing of the pul lands, occupies a part of the attention of your honorable body, y.
memoralists consider it a proper time, to ask for such legislation up the subject, as the peculiar situation of this country, and the inter of its inhabitants, so strongly demand.

Florida has a seacoast, nearly equal in extent, to the whole atlantic coast of the United States. A large portion of it is uninhabited, and less protected from foreign aggression than any other portion of the Union. To attempt to fortify all the accessable points, would be an almost endless expense. It would therefore seem to your memoralists to be desirable to the government to have the country settled as densely as possible; most of the lands now unsold, never would be purchased at the present price asked by the government, and consequently a very great proportion of them would remain perhaps forever unsettled. Your memoralists therefore respectfully request that some law may be passed, giving to all persons who have, or who may hereafter settle on public lands, one quarter section, or such other portion as may be deemed reasonable. The beneficial consequences that would inevitably result from such a measure, must be so obvious, that it would be useless to point them out. Besides greatly increasing the valuable agricultural productions of the country, no measure would cause a more rapid increase of that kind of population, who would develope the resources of the country, and who are so ready to defend their rights and liberties. All wisely regulated governments have uniformly extended encouragement to its industrious and enterprizing citizens, and none are more worthy than those, who by their agricultural pursuits, develope the riches of the country.
“The wealth and strength of a country are its population, and the last part of that population are the cultivators of the soil.”
Resolved, That a copy of this memorial be transmitted to the Delegate in Congress from this Territory—which were read and adopted.

SIR, Your communication of the 1* instant," covering your monthly report of operations for January 1833 and informing the Department that the contract with M. Wyatt for cutting a canal through the natural Bridge on the Saint Marks river had been forfeited and stating that unless otherwise instructed it was your intention to require M*
Wyatt to refund the amount of money which had been advanced to him under that contract. It is not perceived that the department can give you any instructions on the subject. The law positively prohibits advances of the government funds in anticipation of an equivalent to be subsequently rendered, under any circumstances whatever; and as you are individually responsible to the Treasury for a satisfactory account of all the government monies placed in

your possession, any instructions from this Department tending to sanction a disposition of them other than that in strict conformity with law & regulations, could only transfer the responsibility from yourself to the head of the Department. It must be for you to determine what course will best subserve your own interest in the matter.
It is with great satisfaction that the Department learns that you have been successful in your operations at the Devils elbow.”

SIR, In answer to your letter on the subject of the papers expected from Cuba, and appertaining to the Archives of Florida, and to those requested to be furnished by the Spanish Government, I can add little to what I have said in answer to a letter from the Attorney General, which has been communicated to you, on the same subject.—
By letters received two day's since from the Agent sent to the Havana, to demand the Archives by virtue of a royal Order given for that purpose to the Governor General,” I am led to expect his
(the agent's) arrival in a few days, and that he will bring with him, a list of such papers as he has discovered to be in the Havana; and from former letters some of them related to the powers given to the Governors, or Intendents of Florida in relation to the grants of land.—
From Spain I am in daily expectation of the return of a special Messenger, who will, in all probability, bring with him the answer of the Spanish Government to the application for the papers which were required by the Supreme Court,” and there is great reason to believe from the friendly disposition expressed by the present Minister for foreign affairs that such answer will be satisfactory.—
The opinion expressed in the close of my letter to the Attorney General, that the interest of the U.S. might require the production of those papers, was entirely founded on the fact of their being thought

material by the Court, not having myself any knowledge of the merits of the causes in which they were required.—
I am very respectfully, yr ob. Servt, Signed—EDW LIVINGSTON.

You will consider yourself as positively limited to the appropriation for the Survey now under your direction, and on no account exceed it, as expenditures beyond the amount appropriated will not be passed to your credit. And should this amount prove to be inadequate to complete the Survey, you will take such a general view of the part incompleted, as will enable you to present its prominent features in the form of a report, and furnish the data from which an estimate may be made for a future continuation of the Survey.
You will exercise your discretion in superintending suspending operations should the time required to make the survey extend to the sickly season, in which case you will repair with your assistants to this city. But as the locality of this duty is so distant it is extremely desirable that you should do all that may be in your power, before the period for the exercise of the discretion now reposed in you may arrive.*

<docbody>TO HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your several letters of the 1st * 2nd * and 3rd Inst * with their respective enclosures, and will briefly reply to their various topics in the order they are therein mentioned.
Mr. Richards having been substituted in the place of the former Interpreter, and you considering it expedient to employ one, he will be continued as such, until you shall think it advisable to dispense with his services.
The charge of 300$ to reimburse you for expenses incurred in feeding and providing for Indians at your Superintendency, will under the circumstances of the Case be allowed by the Secretary of War—The rule governing such charges was not intended to be inflexible in its application, but as a prevention of ill-founded claims.—The Secretary is perfectly satisfied of your alledged expenditure, and cannot refuse the allowance of your charge.
The item of 115$, for building an Office at the Agency in the Seminole Nation, and charged in J. Phagan's account will be allowed on your recommendation for its payment, coupled with the Certificates of Capt Graham and Erastus R. Rogers, Esqr.
Colo. Gadsden has also recommended Mr. William Pope as Agent, and as well as yourself speaks with much emphasis of the expediency of such an Appointment. The Secretary of War coincides in sentiment with you in this particular, and considers the appointment of an Agent an act of justice to the Indians, and calculated to prevent a repetition of outrageous conduct alike illegal and disgraceful. The appointment of Mr. Pope is left to yourself, and his compensation will be 500$ per annum. He will not be considered a regular Sub-
Agent, but his duties will be similar, and he will use his utmost exertions to prevent intrusion and outrage of every description. You will be pleased to furnish him with instructions necessary for the faithful discharge of his official duties.
The measures adopted by you for the expulsion and punishment

of the Intruders were called for by circumstances and have received the cordial approbation of the Department—It would be very gratifying, if those oppressors and wrong-doers should receive merited but legal chastisement.—
I have &c., ELBERT HERRING.

<docbody>SIR, I deem it my duty to represent to you, that, the road on the West bank of the Apalachicola, immediately opposite to this place, and for the improvement of which, an appropriation has been made by Congress," is extremely bad, and remains so during the greater part of the year. I have examined the ground at different times, and am satisfied, that, a bridge across the bayou will shorten the travel,—
make a better road, -and, with a causeway, will remain good throughout the year. The Mail Stage from Tallahassee to Pensacola passes over this road, four times per week.
I transmit herewith, a letter from M* Russ addressed to Mr King,"
the former of whom, is, I understand, the Contractor to repair the road under the appropriation referred to. I also transmit a sketch of the ground furnished me by M. King. The yellow track” represents the present travelled route on the bank of the river, in rich alluvial, which, in wet weather is rendered almost inpassable, and, in this rich soil, remains so for many weeks. The red track” represents a better route, and shews the proposed bridge across the bayou.
From the bridge to the ferry, the road must have a causeway in several places. Beyond the bridge, the road soon strikes into a high pine-barren. The cost of a road in this kind of soil, consists merely in felling the pine trees to the proposed width of the road, and in removing the stumps.
I have considered it a matter of duty to bring this subject to your notice, because of the establishment of an Arsenal at this place," and

because of the necessity for a good road on the West bank of the Apalachicola, on which to transport with facility, at all times, Military Stores for West Florida, or for the Southern Counties of Alabama."

SIR I have to acknowledge the reception of your letter of the 18"

Blunts exploring party has returned & report favourably of the Country to which he & his band propose removing—The chiefs from the other Towns who accompanied the expedition seem much pleased and have made such representations as may induce, in thier opinion, Econchatimeco & Vacapasacy to listen more favourably to the propositions from our government—They have invited me to visit once more their Towns and make another assay towards a negotiation-I
shall accordingly leave this in a few days for that purpose & hope to report to you a final & successful result—
Blunt has sought two or three interviews with me of late, all relating to subject connected with the future execution of the engagement he has entered into for the removal of himself & followers West. As he is now anxious to commence the preparations necessary for his migration, it may be important to give to the Executive of the Territory some directions on the subject.

<docbody>SIR I herewith inclose you my Monthly Report of operations on St Marks River and Harbour for March 1833, together with my account current of expenditures for the same, & for funds remaining in my Hands of the appropriation for Apalachicola River, with the United States.
The improvement in the Harbour at the Devils Elbow has been completed as far as the funds available for that purpose would allow
& I had hoped as far as would be necessary for the trade of the place.
But I have been able to get but 9 feet of water through the cut when
10% or 11 feet is desired. I was in hopes that once blasting over the bed of the cut, weighing the rock broken up & dredging, would have secured this debth, but the nature of the rock is such that the blasting did not produce sufficient effect for this purpose and it will require to be gone over with again, for which I shall make an estimate for another appropriation should you deem it proper to ask for it. 300
cubic yards of rock was removed by the work of blasting that has been done.
The improvements of the river above have gone on as well as possible during the month; the water being too high to work at the best advantage; and now it will be necessary to suspend further opera-

tions till the dry season comes on again. The channel is opened to within about two miles of the point where it is contemplated to terminate the work: to complete which and deepen parts of the channel that were cleared during high water will require the remainder of the funds available for the river—
I have now the boats repairing for Apalachicola Harbour, in anticipation of orders from Capt. Chase to go on with that work."

<docbody>SIR Since my last letter to you, I have been assiduously engaged for 3 weeks, 2 of which I remained in my office day and night until I became prostrate, and was brought home in my carriage, since which period I have been confined to my house, and now only able to pass to the adjoining room to see a sick daughter that has been at the point of death, but of whom, hopes are now entertained that she will recover—In furtherance of your instructions, I have succeeded in making out new General & special instructions & contracts together with the necessary notice to private claimants and the Diagrams necessary shewing the ground each Deputy will occupy, a copy of which is furnished the Keeper of the Archives at S*Augustine for the information of said claimants and the notice directed to be printed in the paper of that place—I have now despatched seven Deputies one of whom I hope to see in a few days, to make return of the Aradonda grant, when he will be again under orders to fill his niche in the present arrangement. I am hourly expecting the arrival of another under orders, and there are two finishing, the work remaining on the

west of Appalachicola and the Bays of S" Joseph and S*Andrews, when they will be sent East to complete my present design, which is to extend the Surveys South on the Atlantic, as far as Lake George connecting with the surveys heretofore made on the west of and contiguous to the S" Johns River, as far south as the mouth of the Oaklawaha and paralel with the Aradonda grant—
The President having thought proper to signify in a resent letter that I must travel for the restoration of my health,” I am very solicitous to be placed in possession of the $17.000 asked for in my last, to enable me to place it in such a situation by confidential attorney as will secure its payment to my Deputies when they shall have made returns, previous to my coming back—The amount under contract will be almost 7.000 miles which together with the contingencies will require upwards of 28.000$ as previously indicated—
Your early attention to this subject (if not previously attended to), is earnestly solicited, as it will be of the utmost importance to my Deputies to receive their respective dues in proper time-
I have the honor to be, very respectfully; Y” Ob"S"

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to send you enclosed a letter from Gen'Call in relation to the compensation of the Law Agent of the U. States in Florida for the last year." From the number of the Suits depending in that Territory against the U. States, brought on concessions and grants of land alleged to have been made by the Spanish authorities I am satisfied that the greater portion of the time of the agent, for the last year must have been occupied in attending to the duties of his agency—And from the manner in which the business appears to have been conducted on the part of the public as well as from the statement of Gen'Call I am convinced that the duties of the agent have been diligently and faithfully performed. The sum of $1500 is in my opinion not more than a reasonable and fair compensation for the

services actually rendered by him during the last year and I recommend that it be paid to him accordingly.—
I am Sir very respectfully Y. Obt St R. B. TANEY—

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to transmit to you my Returns and accounts of the 1* Quarter of the present Year, for the Quarter Masters Dept:
and the several roads under my superintendence.
The repairs to the Road from Jacksonville to Alachua Court House will be completed on the 16" of this Month, when I shall commence on the Old Kings Road, I should have immediately complied with the instructions contained in your letter of the 15" of Feb: " had

the amount applicable to the Old Kings Road been sufficient to authorize the purchase of the necessary tools implements and means of transportation to carry on the work, but as it was not, I thought it advisable not to commence until the completion of the Jacksonville Road, that I might avoid the necessity of purchasing another outfit.
As to the balance of $110 remitted to me for the Road from Alaqua to Mariana, the amount is too small to enable me to make any application of it on that Road, my transportation there would almost amount to that sum, I have therefore deemed it proper to defer until I receive further instructions from you.
In my Quarterly Return of Quarter Masters Stores, you will perceive I have reported a mule lost by death. I presume a certificate of the fact is necessary. I will forward one as soon as I can procure it. I did not think it proper to delay my accounts for the want of it.

SIR, The treaty with Appalachicola bands of Indians, concluded October 11" 1832," having been ratified "I will thank you to inform them of the fact and of the expectation of the Government, that they will remove from the land by the 1st day of November next, agreeably to the stipulations of the treaty. It is not known here why this provision cannot be carried into effect. Should however unavoidable circumstances in the words of that instrument occur to prevent the Indians from going they will be allowed to remain for another year. But before any assurances upon that subject are given to them you will report those circumstances should they be alledged to exist, to this Department, where they will be judged of and the matter determined. If the Indians evince an unnecessary desire to remain, I will thank you to discourage their expectations as far as proper, and inform them distinctly that the case presented must be a very strong one, before the Government will assent to their continuance.

The sum of 10,000$, due to them under the provisions of the treaty will be remitted whenever you report, that the proper time has arrived.
I will thank you to transmit a statement showing the number of the Indians that may remain who are entitled to an annuity under the treaty of Camp Moultrie in order that the Department may have the proper data for providing that annuity when the removal takes place.”—

<place-time>15th April 1833.</place-time>
<docbody>ROB" BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 31* ultimo wherein you state as follows:"
“In furtherance of your instructions I have succeeded in making out new general and special instructions and contracts together with the necessary notice to private claimants, and the diagrams necessary shewing the ground each Deputy will occupy, a copy of which is furnished the Keeper of the archives at St. Augustine for the information of said claimants and the notice directed to be printed in paper of that place.” I have to request that copies of these diagrams contracts and instructions may be sent also to this Office.
You further state—“I have now dispatched seven deputies, one of whom I hope to see in a few days, to make return of the Arredondo grant, when he will be again under orders to fill his niche in the present arrangement.” "
You further state—“I am hourly expecting the arrival of another under orders, and there are two finishing the work remaining on the West of the Apalachicola, and the Bays of St. Joseph and St. Andrews, when they will be sent East to complete my present design, which is, to extend the surveys South on the Atlantic as far as Lake George, connecting with the surveys heretofore made on the West of, and contiguous to, the St. Johns river, as far South as the mouth of the Oaklawaha, and parallel with the Arredondo grant,”
In reference to these various objects of survey you request to be furnished with funds to the amount of seventeen thousand dollars
“to enable me to place it in such a situation by confidential attorney as will secure its payment to my deputies when they shall have made returns previous to my coming back.” You further state, that the amount under contract will be almost seven thousand miles “which will require upwards of $28,000 as previously indicated.”
In your communication of the 11." April 1832,” in reply to my letter

832 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S of the 13" March preceding, "you represented that there were due to this Office and to the Registers of the Eastern and Western Districts, plats of nearly One hundred townships which were then nearly ready to be forwarded, besides which there were thirteen townships East of the Meridian which had been sectioned, and which you represented to have been recently returned to your Office, the plats of which had not been made out; besides these were the re-surveys on the Escambia river and its vicinity. Such being the arrears of your Office already existing, I am apprehensive that you have undertaken more work than your Office, under the circumstances of the existing arrears, your own feeble health, and intended absence from official labors will have the means of controlling.
The rendering of the returns of surveys now due to this Office, and the District land Offices is a duty which should have taken precedence of any other, or which should not be interfered with by duties of a subsequent date.
You propose that the sum of $17.000 which you require to make payment for surveys now in course of execution shall be placed in the hands of a confidential Attorney to secure its payment to your deputies during your absence. This course of proceeding is utterly inadmissible. The accounts of a Deputy Surveyor cannot be closed until his field notes shall have been examined and the accuracy thereof tested by actual protraction in the Office of the Surveyor General.
The Department holds each Surveyor General responsible under his bond for all payments made to his deputies, and no Surveyor General is credited in the Settlement of his accounts at the Department, with the vouchers of his Deputy Surveyors until the evidence of the due performance of the service is filed in this Office.
In the execution of the duties of your Office, the Department expects that you will rigidly adhere to the specific instructions heretofore given. I am apprehensive that there has been much bad surveying in Florida, and the utmost precaution must be used in the making of future surveys; and in case any of your Surveyors have been detected in slighting their work under former contracts, such must not be continued in the public service. You are requested to proceed no further with the surveys than you have means in your Office of making the necessary critical examinations of the field notes for the same within a reasonable time after the surveys are completed, and prior to the settlement of the accounts of the Deputies. To effect these objects, and at the same time to bring up the existing arrears in your Office, it matters not how much the surveying operations have

necessarily to be restricted, inasmuch as the Government would prefer delay in the execution of the public surveys rather than incur the risk of having them badly executed.
Under all these circumstances, I do not feel justified in drawing on the Secretary of the Treasury for the whole amount of the funds you require, until you shall enable me to lay before him explicit information as to the mode in which the money is to be applied—that is to say: the number of townships to be paid for—the name of the Surveyor—copies of the contracts accompanied by a diagram shewing the field of labor under each contract—Meanwhile I have requested a remittance to be made to you of five thousand dollars.
I am &c.

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30” ulto.” communicating intelligence of the return and favorable report of Blunt's exploring party.
It would be very gratifying to the Department if the invitation given you to visit again those Towns, whose Chiefs have been disinclined to remove, should result in successful negotiation.
The Department has no authority to advance four hundred dollars to Blunt to enable him and his party to make the necessary preparations for their removal—Three thousand dollars have been already advanced pursuant to the treaty, and it stipulates that ten thousand dollars shall be paid, “when they have completed their arrangements and have commenced the removal of their whole party”.-Desirous as the Department is of their speedy departure, his request cannot be granted, altho’ the Department concurs entirely in opinion with you “that to make the advance would be safe and might be advantageous”. It cannot, however, be difficult for Blunt to obtain credit for that amount payable out of the ten thousand dollars, to be received when his party shall be ready to remove.
If you succeed in your negotiation with the other Chiefs, you will be pleased to make your payments prospective, there being but little money available for that purpose, the five hundred thousand dollar fund having been expended or pledged for other purposes. Payment

to any considerable amount must consequently be deferred for the necessary appropriation by Congress."

<docbody>SIR. Governor Duval left this Territory a few days since on a visit to his family now in Kentucky, and in consequence his duties as Governor of Florida have devolved upon myself. He will not probably return till late next fall.
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 12th instant addressed to him respecting the Appalachicola Indians.” No copy of the Treaty of last fall,” or any document relating to it have ever been filed in the Secretary's office, but I
have since the receipt of your letter on yesterday, written to General Gadsden who concluded the Treaty, and shall probably see him in a few days and obtain that precise and certain information necessary for me to have, and which altho’ present at the signing of the Treaty, and having a general recollection of its terms, I do not now sufficiently possess.
I do not anticipate any difficulty in getting off by the 1* of Nov:, all those Indians of the Appalachicola towns, whose chiefs signed the Treaty last fall, and those not included in the Treaty will ultimately follow Col: Blunt, and may possibly be induced to go with him now.
The agreement of the Seminoles to remove will I have no doubt operate strongly upon Mulatto King (Vacapechassa) and Econchati-
Mico—the two principal Appalachicola chiefs who did not agree last fall and who are yet said to be obstinate.
There are no official or other data in my possession from which I can at present make as you request “a statement showing the number of indians that may remain who are entitled to an annuity under the treaty of Camp Moultrie.” The pay rolls of the Agent now on file with his accounts at Washington furnish the best information on

the subject at present in my power to render. I have adopted measures however to obtain more certain and authentic criteria which when received I will transmit to you forthwith.
No efforts will be spared by me to carry into effect the views of the Government as indicated in your communication, and I shall avail myself as early as I can of the benefit of a consultation with Gen: Gadsden, in whose ability on this subject I have great confidence.
Without the slightest wish to evade the performance of any duty, or to avoid responsibility; I would (solely because I consider it the best course)—respectfully suggest the employment of Gen Gadsden as a special Agent or commissioner to make every arrangement necessary to get Col: Blunt & party off, under the treaty he concluded—
the advancement to him forthwith of all the funds that may be called for—the investing him with power to treat with those indians who have not agreed to remove and with the fullest authority to exercise his discretion as circumstances may dictate. In such case all assistance that I can render him will be cheerfully and promptly given.
If however it should not be deemed necessary to appoint Col: Gadsden as I have suggested every duty assigned to me will be fulfilled to the extent of my ability, and I shall on every opportunity seek his counsel.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to report that the operations of improving the St Marks River & Harbour have been discontinued the present Month for causes stated in my last Monthly Report.”—In the mean time, however, while waiting orders from Capt Chase I have been preparing the Boats & Dredging Apparatus for the Apalachicola harbour, which in the course of the following month will be ready for that work.
I have now received instructions from Capt Chase to take charge of the improvements in Apalachicola harbour and to report to you a

plan of operations for it, with the continuance of the improvements of the St Marks river—and also to make an examination of the Ocklockney river which I shall do without delay—
The plan I propose for the two first of these works is to carry them on together when the boats &c may be ready for the one and the waters become low enough for the other. I have engaged competent
& trusty overseers for these works who can carry them on by my visiting each monthly through the season, from some intermediate point, that I can select for the convenience of the two places and where I can enjoy good health, which has become highly important for me, from the severe sickness I have experienced every season that I have spent at the South.
I propose to carry on the operations of dredging for the straight channel from the town of Apalachicola to St. Georges Sound agreeable to my report for this season.

<docbody>GENERAL GRATIOT
SIR. Your letter of the 14th March * from the irregularities in our mails of late, was not received untill some days since; and though

I could have replied to it immediately, so far as regarded myself:
I deemed it advisable to postpone an answer untill I could satisfy you in the other request, “to designate a suitable Individual” to take charge of the additional improvements contemplated on the Inland communications between the S" Marys and S" Johns rivers—
It would be gratifying to me, if I could consistently with my private interests, as well as those of the Government take personal charge of the work appropriated for; but the work itself is not such as authorise my devoting my individual attention to it & its distance from my place of residence (nearly 200 miles) precludes the possibility of my doing justice to the Government as a Temporary director &
Inspector—My own opinions, repeatedly expressed, are that the Government should in all cases, if practicable, limit the charge &
superintendence of Governmental or public works to their own Engineer Officers; or to competent officers by detail from the other Corps—I have therefore, after consultation with L' Long, thought proper to recommend to the notice of your Dep" L' J W Harris, who is at present stationed in this Territory at Camp King, & who wishes, on account of his health, to remain employed in Southern latitudes—He is willing, as I am informed to undertake the Superintendence & agreeably to the views I have of the proper manner of conducting the work—There have been expressed in my estimate:—
That a mud machine, similar to those which have been used in Mobile Bay & on the S*Marks (one of which is now in operation on the latter river & will soon be transferred to the Appalachicola river—The plan therefore which I would suggest to your consideration is that L' Harris be appointed Superintendent with instructions to confer with me, & that he should then go on board of the mud machine in the Appalachicola & there acquire a perfect knowledge of the mode of applying it; while the Engine, flats &c are constructing for the one to be used on the Inland passage between the St Johns & S' Marys—
All these preparatory arrangements he could attend to & mature while he was so qualifying himself as to the proper & most efficient use of the machine As I contemplate that he should live with the hands on the machine personally directing the operations, without the expense of any other superintendencence; it is suggested to your consideration whether a compensation, different from the Extra which is usually allowed Superintending Engineers ought not to be allowed him—He will in fact be required to act as Engineer & Superintendent all of which he may do by residing as he ought to do, on the Mud Machine, & from the fact that the operations will be concentrated—My estimate was founded on this view of the subject, allowing something like 100
dollars per month to the officer & Superintendent on board and I

think this sum in addition to his pay as Lieut will not be extravigant—
Of course all the advice & directions I may give are gratuitous & only to aid in the accomplishment of a work which as a Citisen of this Territory I feel a deep interest in—
From the knowledge I have of the passage to be improved I am satisfied that the use of a Mud Machine will be most effectual &
economical—The working party residing on board, working constantly
& daly untill, all the obstructions, which are mud, are effectually removed *

<place-time>Surveyors Office TALLAHASSEE May 2nd 1833.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR In reply to yours of the 13th ultimo” I have to remark, that it has been my invariable practice to require from each Deputy Surveyor a penal bond with two good and approved securities, in double the amount of his contract, for the faithful and timely execution of his surveys, his field notes have always been acitically examined and the accuracy of all traverse and fractional work tested by trigonometrical calculations before payment of the account, if subsequent to this any neglect or deception is detected in the surveys of any Deputy, his Securities and himself, all are held liable for the cost and

expenses of a resurvey or otherwise—but two instances of this kind have occured since the establishment of this Office, one Thomas F
White a brother of the Delegate from this Territory, the other Patton Anderson of Tennessee, in both instances I had the land resurveyed at the expense of each surveyor and his securities. To defer the payments of the accounts of Deputy Surveyors until “The accuracy thereof is tested by actual protraction in the Office of the Surveyor General” would produce an abandonment of the service generally, or at least be the cause of serious inconvenience and in some cases of ruinous consequence to the Deputy, whilst it is believed that the practice adopted in this Office is equally efficient, and more equitable—
To test the accuracy of surveys by actual protraction in the office where there are so many private claims and other fractional work as may be expected in the surveys now executing, will require twelve or eighteen months after the execution of the contracts before payment can be made. I trust that no new views or regulations of the Department may embarrass the surveys already contracted for, and now in progress of execution.
Any “had surveys in Florida” of which you may be informed, is not known to me, and I would be glad to be furnished with any information in your possession on the subject, to enable me to have it made good at the expense of the proper parties. My “impressions”
founded on examination and information are entirely of a different aspect.
The mistake by Clements & Exum on the Escambia River was natural and almost unavoidable from the tremenduous freshet which gave rise to it but has been corrected and resurveys made entire at very great cost to them. I employ no persons but such as I consider gentlemen of good character and well recommended to perform the public surveys, but the tange of slander and usual detraction in these times are too common to be silenced by correct deportment, and to use an Irish saying “only requires that we” give them rope and they will hang thouselves” With regard to the work nearly completed in this Office, I have to remark that the resignation of one, and the sickness of the other of my Clerks, put a total suspension of business in my Office for a time, &, shortly after it was resumed, your orders for the despatch of Deputies again suspended those labours, as the duties preparatory to their despatch required the services of myself and both Clerks for about a month.
The work alluded to is now ready for general examination and adjudication except the execution of perhaps one hundred and sixty copies of the field notes of private claims on the certificates. many of which are lengthy, and three copies of each required, After the completion of this work it will require fully one month (by all hands)

for comparison, examination, and adjudication, to the exclusion of all other busines You are refered to another letter containing my general and special instructions together with a diagram and notice to private claimants, which documents will show you explicitly, together with ardinary contingencies, that the requisition for seventeen thousand dollars, was not more than would be required, with what was on hand to meet the demands of the contemplated surveys; and I can assure you that I never have yet, nor ever shall make application for public funds beyond the legal demands for public services. I claim an honesty of character and deportment, that puts suspicion in the shade and my requisitions have never yet met with other than promt compliance.
I shall again write you by the next mail.

842 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S the Public Archives under his hand and seal, furnished by the Claimants, or their Agents, to the Deputy surveyor of the District in which said claims may be situate, to enable him to execute his duties under the instructions furnished him.
I confidently hope that every necessary facility will be afforded to the Surveyors to enable them to lay down the Private claims without delay, otherwise they must proceed with their labours in surveying the country as public domain.
To point out and identify the beginning corner of each Claim by the owner or agent, is of the utmost importance.

Special Instructions to Surveyors Surveyors Office TALLAHASSEE. 1833.
To. A. B–Deputy Surveyor:—
In surveying private land claims in East Florida, you will have, perhaps, an arduous and Critical duty to perform, and much must depend upon the exercise of a sound discretion, as cases or circumstances may arise not to be anticipated, and to meet which no special instructions can be framed. The following essential regulations are to be rigidly observed in every instance in which you may be called upon to survey a private claim. to wit:
No claim is to be surveyed unless the same has been confirmed, and the evidence of which must be the certificate under the hand &
seal of the Keeper of the Public Archives at S*Augustine.
The calls of the original Grant are alone to be your guide in Surveying it. The following quotation from the letter of the Commissioner Gen' Land Office dated 10" July 1830," and the “animadversions”
therein alluded to, are furnished in order that you may be better guarded against deceptions which may be attempted to be practised upon you, and that you may be in possession of all the information in this Office in relation to the difficulties you may meet with in surveying the private land claims in East Florida—
“GEN" LAND OFFICE 10th July 1830
“Except to call your attention to the animadversions of the Register
& Receiver in their report on the surveys made by M Clarke, which correspond with the views of this Office as heretofore communicated
"Ante, p. 425. <
s
s

to you, and the surveys of M Clarke cannot be considered as valid except where they may be established by their intrinsic calls or where they may stand the teste of blocking out as heretofore suggested to you.”
Extract from the Report of the Register & Receiver of East Florida—“We did intend to say something upon the subject of the Spanish Surveys, from which we are now precluded by the want of time. We will simply remark, upon this subject, that the Surveys made under the Superintendance of Marrot are entitled to unlimited respect, and should, in every case, be regarded as conclusive of the boundaries, with regard to surveys made by private surveyors, or M. Geo J. F. Clarke, the public surveyor, styling himself the Surveyor General, we entertain a widely different opinion.”
The Report after Commenting on the deviations of M" Clarke from his instructions, as farther evidence of the illegality of his Acts, gone on to add, “when the lands were not specially designated, he would locate wherever the claimants pointed out, provided the place was vacant, and in cases where the land was specially located by the Grant, he would, nevertheless, at the request of the grantee, locate it at any other place
“When M* Clarke was directed to survey by the Grant and when he tells us that he surveyed without reference thereto, at a place fifty or an hundred miles off we believe M* Clarke has exceeded his authority. When the Grant Contains one undivided portion of land, and M Clarke has surveyed a part of it in one place and a part in another, whereever a stick of live Oak, or a foot of Hammock could be found, the survey is not in accordance with ‘the tittle of property or Grant of the Government. and is therefore void'
“When M* Clarke was directed to survey, to an applicant, four Miles square of land in a body, and locate a part of it in Alachua, a part on the S* Mary's and a part on the Indian river more than One hundred miles asunder, as was his custom, we humbly conceive M. Clarke has exceeded his authority, In a word, when to an officer of the Government written and postive instructions are given, prescribing his duties, and regulating the manner in which they should be performed and when that Officer, before a Competent tribunal has declared upon Oath, that all of his Official acts were performed without reference to those instructions, and in direct opposition to their mandates, we have no hesitation in declaring that every such act of that Officer is null and void, and unworthy of Consideration.
The he was bound to measure to the claimants the lands at the place designated in the Grant, and according to the boundaries therein

844 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S specified. That he had not authority to subdivide an integral grant, nor to change the location when once it was made; and yet from the papers in this Office, and from the express declarations of M Clarke himself it appears too plainly that it was his constant practice to do all these.”
At or before the time of reaching the Section of Country assigned you by the accompanying Diagram, you will give every possible notoriety to the fact, that those who own private claims in the same, may attend, and have them surveyed and reported A frequent recurrence to, and perusal of, Your General and Special instructions is emphatically enjoined-

in reference to the inland navigation between the S" John's & S"

passage between the S" John's & S." Mary's. This determination was adopted from a belief that the machines on the Savannah river would be available before that employed on the Apalachicola referred to by you, & could be transferred with less expense & risk. I shall avail myself of your kindness in suggesting that the Officer charged with this improvement be referred to you for information before commencing operations.
Be pleased to accept my thanks for your suggestions on this subject and for your attention to my letter to you of the 14" of March last."

<docbody>SIR. On yesterday Col Blunt the principal chief of the Appalachicola indians and who made the treaty with Colonel Gadsden last fall visited me in compliance with a notice I had previously sent him. He states to me that him self and all the indians named in the Treaty will get off by the 20th of July. As I am acquainted with his arrangements I have no doubt he will be ready by that time. The transmission of the funds to pay the $10,000 and the commutation of the annuity &c is therefore necessary, as soon as possible. Great difficulty and trouble occurs from the manner in which funds are generally transmitted to this Superintendancy. Drafts on New Orleans Mobile or Charleston (& especially the latter places) should never be sent us. We cannot get them cashed in Specie here without paying a discount of 1 & 34 per cent and those for large sums we cannot sell. Drafts on New York here will generally command a premium (which the Government would save) in exchange for current Bk notes of 2 percent and can be cashed for Specie at par at our Banks. In order to prevent difficulty I would again renew the suggestion in my letter a few days since to the Secy of War, that authority from the Department to draw on it for the amount to be paid to Blunt and his indians be given to Col: Gadsden or myself.
I shall visit Blunts town to morrow to ascertain the precise number of his indians entitled to the annuity under the treaty of Camp Moultrie and also of those that remain, their quota for this year being then to be paid to them, and I will advise the Department thereof forthwith.

848 7" E R R H TO R J A L P A P E R S Blunt requests me to write for his son at the public indian school in Kentucky. It is necessary he should be here before the 20th of July. As the Seminoles are going off also the seven other indian boys from Florida could all be sent home at the same time. I have however requested Col: Gadsden to write to the Department on this subject.
Col: Blunt delivered me the enclosed letter from M Littlebury Jones " a highly respectable citizen residing near him & I received that from M. Pope * the temporary Sub agent (also enclosed) a day or two since. I have no doubt of the truth of the robbery and it renders a visit by me to Blunts town more advisable.
I had hoped Col: Gadsden would have been able to have gone over with me and have concluded a treaty with the remaining chiefs, but he cannot. I visited him three days since for the purpose of consultation, and will use such proper efforts as are in my power to get them to consent to go next fall."

SIR, Congress at its last session appropriated the sum of Three thousand two hundred dollars, for the purpose of purchasing the land occupied for Military purposes at Key West," and I will thank you to take measures, as early as you conveniently can, to carry into effect the Contract with the proprietors. The Island of Key West was confirmed by the Commissioners, under separate grants, to two indi-

viduals, but Mr. Symington," one of the present proprietors informed me yesterday that he and his associates had purchased the adverse title, and that the deed for the purchase, duly executed according to law, had been recorded in the Clerks Office at Key West. I enclose herewith papers numbered from 1. to 10.,” from which you will be able to understand the terms on which the purchase is to be, or rather has been, made. You will call upon the Attorney for the United States to investigate the title to the land, and if it be found unobjectionable, employ him to draw the deed, and you will in all respects be governed by his advice. On the deed being executed by all the parties interested, you will pay the amount respectively due to each; but if payment be made to the Agents of any of the parties it must be on powers of Attorney properly executed.
You are authorized to draw on me for the whole amount of the appropriation, or for such part of it as may be required—Should any of the parties be absent, and not have duly authorized Attorneys to sign the deed and receive the money, you will have it executed by such of them as may be present, and you will cause it to be recorded in the proper office and forward it to me as soon thereafter as possible.”—

<docbody>SIR: The Escambia River will not, probably, be low enough to admit of its examination before July. I have however satisfied myself as to the nature of the obstacles to the navigation, having obtained information from persons acquainted with the River.
The obstacles consist of logs and trees lying along the bed of the River, and of trees hanging over its banks.
It is desirable that the contemplated improvement should be commenced as soon as the low stage of water will permit, and the necessary preparations can be made, I would therefore propose to make an examination of the River in July, and in the mean time to make partial arrangements with persons interested in its improvement and who are desirous to contract for the execution of the same."

I have issued an advertisement calling for proposals to be handed in by the 30 June; I enclose a copy of it. The contractors would require at least one month to make the necessary preparations, such as the building of scows &c and the collecting of laborers, so that they could not commence operations before the 1* August, but if they can be commenced by that time, and the season prove favorable, we should be enabled to apply the appropriation with much advantage.
The averaged cost of the Improvement will not probably exceed
$100 per mile, so that at least 50 or 60 miles may be effected under the existing appropriation; and the whole extent of the River eeñapleted improved for a sum not exceeding $15.000.
There is no doubt but that the River may be made navigable for Keel boats at all Seasons of the Year. The distance following the meanderings of the River is about 120 miles.
The impvmt of the River will afford many advantages to persons residing near it; to the town of Pensacola; and to the public works in the Harbour.
The experience obtained from two month's work will enable me to make an exact estimate of cost of the whole improvement, and to submit it to the Department by the 30" September in my annual Report.
Should the foregoing propositions and remarks meet your approbation, I will proceed without delay to make the necessary preparations for the commencement of the work."

The Undersigned Having been charged by the Engineer Department with the improvement of the River Escambia, invites the attention of those persons who may be desirous to contract for the execution of the same.
Persons communicating with the undersigned will be pleased to State:-
1st. The nature of the existing impediments to a facile navigation for Keel Boats at all seasons of the year.
2d. Whether the River can be made navigable for Keel Boats at its lowest stage of water.
3d. The manner in which they propose to effect the improvement.
4th. The amount and kind of forces which they propose to employ.
5th. The terms upon which they will engage to perform the work—
the time required and the amount of compensation.
It is desirable that no time should be lost in effecting the improvement; and that no person should be employed in the execution of it, who is not fully competent, both on the score of the means at his disposal, and his knowledge of the work to be performed, to produce prompt and satisfactory results; it will, therefore, be necessary that all applications to the undersigned should be supported by the recommendations of persons residing near the River and its tributaries, and who are interested in the proposed improvement.

<docbody>HON: EDWARD LIVINGSTON Secretary of State SIR! I deem it my duty to bring to the Notice of Government, through you, the wants of the District of West Florida in Court-
Houses and Jails, and to urge upon it, the necessity of making some provision, adequate to the remedy of the evil.
There are six Counties in West Florida, and of Course, six places where U.S. Courts are held twice a year; and yet, save in the County of Jackson, there is not a single Court House in the District, nor is there One Jail. Three of the Counties, to wit, Walton, Washington and Fayette contain but a small population, the business of the Courts in them is not great; nor is it likely that, for some years to come, there will be any important increase. But the Courts of Pensacola, Jackson and Appalichicola are important, and their business is increasing.
In these three Counties, therefore, it is necessary, that there should be Court Houses and Jails—more especially, in Pensacola and Appalachicola, which are Sea Port Towns, and where the necessity of Confining Criminals will often arise.
Except in the County of Jackson, I hold the Sessions of the Courts in private houses, which are rented, for that purpose, by the Marshall.
As we have no Jails at all, the Criminal law cannot be enforced, as it should be.
There was, formerly, a Court House in this City; but a Year or two

since, it was pulled down by the City Authorities, for the avowed purpose of extending a Street through the Lot, although the Lot is the property of Government.
Untill suitable buildings can be erected in this City, for a Court House, there is a building here, belonging to the United States, which at the expence of two or three hundred dollars, might be fitted up for a Court room. It the house, formerly used as the store of the Commissary: it is now in the Occupation of a Merchant of Pensacola.
Unless Government will erect suitable Court Houses and Jails in this Territory, I fear we shall never have them, as the Treasury of the Territory is too poor for such an Undertaking.
If Congress should determine to build a Custom house and Post Office in this City, as has been suggested, it would not be an important addition to the Costs of such a building if, under the same roof, provision was made for the Accomodation of the Court and it's Officers.
Be pleased to have the enclosed letter delivered according to it's Address.
Allow me to improve the present Opportunity of tendering to you an Assurance of the very high esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be”

SIR: I have just received a Report from Lieut. Long, who informs me, that in compliance with my orders he has examined the Ochlockeny River to within a short distance of the Georgia line, with a view to its improvement. Lt Long found the obstructions in the River to consist of logs & trees that have fallen in from the Banks,

& of trees hanging over the channel so as to be in the way of Steam Boats that otherwise could navigate the River during the season of high water. These obstructions exist throughout the River as high up as the Georgia Line. It is deemed practicable to remove them, & highly important to the rich & fertile country through which it flows.
From the high stage of water, Lt Long was not enabled to make other than imperfect estimates of the amount of the obstructions to be removed. He found the River very crooked, having numerous sharp points that may easily be cut off. He supposes the expense of cutting through most of those points would not exceed the expense of cleaning out the bends around them, and would be of great benefit to the navigation. He considers that the clearing out the logs and trees & cutting through these points are all that would be necessary for the Improvement of the River. He estimates the whole distance to be improved at 250 miles & at the following expense.
10,000 day's work at $1---------------------------- $10,000
Boats, implements, tools &c.------------------------ 2,000
Contingencies &c---------------------------------- 3,000
$15,000
The experience which Lt Long has gained in similar operations &
the favorable results he has produced, affords assurance of the correctness of his observations & I have therefore written him, in order to [save] time, to prepare a Project & Estimate for the application]
of the appropriation for this Year, & to submit it for your approval, and, in the mean time, to make such preparatory arrangements as will enable him to commence his work as soon as the low stage of the water will admit.
Lt Long is making active preparations to continue the works at the St Mark's & the Appalachicola Rivers.”

<docbody>DEAR SIR-I was informed a few days past that the Grand Jury of Washington County forwarded to you a presentment of the public road leading from Halls branch to Hickory hill stateing it as a grievance and impassable in its present state as unfinnished,” This grand jury has bin too premature in their presentment, I am the contractor for that part of the road and it is well known to every person who lives near said road that it was impossible for me or any other person to have put it in repair at that time when they made their presentment owing to the local situation of the land that the road passes over, it is a low pine barron country and a number of muddy swamps and

branches running through it and the immense quantity of rain that fell during the Spring months which kept them so much inundated that it was impossible for me to have the road worked upon at that time, as soon as those swamps gets dry enough I intend to commence working the road again and to have it finnished agreeable to the contract made with Lt. John Langle,” I presume that you have a copy of s” contract which states that the road is to be finnished by the
31" of August next; owing to the quantity of water that still remains in those swamps and branches already state which may probably prevent me from finnishing it by the time stated in the contract, taking those circumstance in to consideration, you will pleas be good enough to let me know if it should not be in my power to get it finnished before the months of October or November next whither that differance of time will be considered as a failure so far as to prevent the road from being received when finnished.
With sentiment of the highest respect I remain your Humb"

<docbody>SIR, Indisposition, contracted from my late visit to the Indian Towns on the Appalachicola, has prevented my enclosing you befor this a final arrangement made with the two remaining Indian bands

on said river *—My letters for twelve months past have reported to you the obstinacy and indisposition of the Chiefs of those towns to treat for removal on any conditions. Having at a very early period communicated to them the wishes of the Executive of the U. S. on this subject, exposed the liberality of the Government to them, and explained to them their true interests; I had conceived it most advisable to leave the Chiefs to their own reflections, under a conviction that at the proper time and when convinced that the other Indians generally intended to move; they would readily accede to the propositions I was prepared to make them—A few weeks since I received through the hands of the Acting Governor a communication, signed by the principal Chiefs of both the bands, stating their willingness to treat with me, if I would revisit their towns—I lost no time in riding to the Sub Agents, nearly equidistant from both Econchatimeco and Mulatto Kings reserves, and inviting the principal Chiefs to meet me there—I
found, to my disappointment however, that the Chiefs either did not rightly comprehend the communications which had been made me with the sanction of their signatures; or were unwilling to yield to the obligation I considered that document had imposed on them.
I found in the course of a consultation or talk, that a strong prejudice existed on the minds of Econchatimeco Mulatto King and other Sub chiefs, against Blunt, and a very great distrust of the Interpreter Richards—It was on this account they stated, that they had hitherto declined meeting me by invitations to places where the Chiefs and the Interpreter was to be present—I mentioned to them that it was a matter of indifference to me as commissioner who interpreted if the Indians were satisfied and having ascertained that they would listen to propositions provided they were communicated through Interpreters in whom they reposed confidence, I permitted them to nominate the two whose names are affixed to the Treaties;

the one Jim Walker a colored man who resides in Mulatto Kings Town and has been long used by him as his Interpreter, the other a half breed, Grandson of Econchatimecos and who was for a short time employed by Gov. Duval an Interpreter at Tallahassee. In the course of a long talk I discovered that the above chiefs were as much indisposed to treat for a removal as ever, that the difficulties of effecting a negotiation with them had increased by delay—They have been exposed, ever since the question was first agitated, to so many disagreeing talks from unauthorised individuals; have been secretely influenced by so many who hoped in the negotiation to profit by the terms concluded on, and have listened to so many contradictory tales of the Creeks and Seminoles consenting to and again refusing to remove that they have become distrustful of that event, and without that event they could on no conditions be persuaded to migrate–In addition they have Individually been told that the Creek had made treaties on more favorable terms, and were now realizing fortunes by the sale of the land the Government had given them—
To reconcile these conflicting opinions by inducing them to yield to any distinct proposition for removal was impossible, so long as there was a doubt in their mind as to the Creeks and Seminoles removing—To leave them without effecting any thing, was only exposing the Chiefs Econchatimeco & Mulatto King to the influence of those Individuals and rumors which had already so distracted their minds—I deemed it therefore after some reflection and much consultation with the Indians that the Agreement signed and concluded on, was upon the whole the most advisable arrangement to be made—It would at once quiet the minds of the Indians and remove them from the injurious influences to which I have alluded; and it could not but in time fulfil the objects of Government either by removing the Indians to where they can be protected, or by the voluntary relinquishment on their part of the protection guaranteed to them under the stipulations of previous treaties—I feel assured however that they will ultimately negotiate under the last stipulation of their compact, relinquishing their lands and coming in as parties to the Treaty of Paynes Landing—There can be no difficulty on this subject for they are a component part of the Seminole Nation: were parties to the Treaty of Camp Moultrie, and in the additional article in that Treaty by which reservations were made them on the Appalachicola, the Government reserved the right of ordering them, within the Seminole limits whenever it thought proper to do so-
The difficulties hitherto thrown in the way of negotiation by Econchatimeco & Mulatto King, were evidently with a view of ascertaining with certainty, that the Seminoles and Creeks really intended to migrate, and with the belief that delay would secure to them the

most favorable terms—They now have, should they migrate, the right of selection between selling the Sections to be laid of for them and paying their own expenses, or of receiving 3000 dollars and having their expenses paid—After they have tried the land market and consulted freely with those who are their best friends, they will find that the latter proposition is the most favorable—I cannot believe they will ultimately (should the Seminoles remove) conclude to remain in the Country and come under the laws of Florida; for they have too much understanding not to force the evident consequences of such subjection—They want but time and when convinced of the removal of the Seminoles we may rest assured they will follow—In the mean while I have suggested: and the suggestion has been well received, that each of the Bands send one or two young Cheifs, with the first migrating party of Seminoles to examine for themselves the country on which they may be permanently located, if so disposed—
I had deemed it best (the present reservations having been but imperfectly located, in consequence of the high waters on the Appalachicola at the time they were marked and from their lines interrupting the regularity of our governmental survey that the lands awarded them under the new stipulations should conform to those surveys—The quantity (3) three sections owing to the sinuosities of the river, will probably be very nearly as much in quantity as is contained in the whole of the reservations—were there lands brought into market at this time they would not, at the maximum command more than 5 dollars the acre, or 9600 dollars for each band, an amount somewhat within what the Government would have been compelled to allow under stipulations similar to those concluded with Blunt.
I have now closed my agency with the Indians; and as the service has been one accompanied neither with profit or pleasure; my only gratification must depend upon the approbation with which those services have met by the Executive of the U.S. & yourself as Minister of the Department to which those services appertain "

<source>[NA:TD, ST Misc. Lets. Recd.:ALS]</source>
<place-time>S” Augustine of FLORIDA 17* July 1833</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I beg leave to call your attention to a matter of personal Concern to myself.
It is known to you, that to the Judges of the Superior Courts of Florida the Law gave the salary of 1500$ each *—to which was subsequently added 800$ per annum *— additional compensation for exercising jurisdiction of Land claims in the Territory. Most of these claims occurred in the Eastern District; at present, there are none in West Florida—and but one in Middle Florida—which will not be subject to litigation, and is only waiting the result of the decision of the Supreme Court in another cause, pending on the same principles. In the Southern District there are two or three, and in the Eastern District, where I reside—nearly one hundred.
Under this state of things, I was surprised to learn, when my last quarter's salary fell due, that the Comptroller had decided he would not allow me the additional compensation allowed by Law, because, the last appropriation Act provides for only two Judges and the Department could not decide for which two of the four Judges the Law intended to provide."
I respectfully protested against this decision, and furnished the Comptroller with proofs of the facts I have already stated—but, by the last mail—I learn from Judge Anderson that he will adhere to his decision.*
I am thus obliged to appeal to you—Sir—to do me justice. The enclosed Letters from the District Attorney * and General Call *
[employed by the Government in these cases] * with the certificate of the Clerk of the Court *—establish the facts upon which I rely to shew, that the whole weight of this jurisdiction now devolves upon me; that I am therefore, entitled to the additional compensation—is an inference, which, unless I grossly mistake, is not only reasonable, but irrisistable.

It is true, the Law of the last Session does not designate the particular Judges to be paid—but some Judges are to be paid—and it is a maxim of Reason as well as of Common Law—that—what can be made certain—is certain.
I confess, I shall be put to some inconvenience, if deprived at this time, of the amount due me—but were this not the case—self respect would induce me to apply to you, for relief against a decision unjustly and injuriously affecting my rights.
I am—Sir—Very respectfully Yr Ob S

<source>[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[July 23, 1833]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Congress of the United States.
We the undersigned, inhabitants of Indian Key, Florida, Shippers, Underwriters, Masters of Wessels, and others interested in the commercial and wrecking concerns of the Gulf and Reef of Florida, beg leave to represent, That the rapid increase of business at and in the vicinity of this Island renders it exceedingly desirable that Indian Key should be made a Port of Entry and a Custom House established here.
In the important points of depth of water, goodness and serenity of anchorage, and facility of ingress and egress, the Harbour of Indian Key is not excelled by any in this Southern country. Wessels of the largest class may be brought with ease and perfect safety into the waters of this Port.—It is situated nearly equidistant from Cape Florida and Key West, twenty-seven leagues to windward (eastward)
of the latter Port, and twenty from the Cape. From the main-land of Florida the distance is less than seven leagues, the intermediate sea safe and at all times and seasons navigable for vessels of moderate draught. The alluvial islands, termed Florida Keys, and the southern extremity of the peninsula of Florida, are coming rapidly into notice—
and extensive establishments are now forming for the cultivation of Sugar cane, Sea-island Cotton, Tobacco, Indigo and tropical fruits.
And such is the relative position, that the products of all that portion of the main extending from Cape Sables to Indian River is & must

be brought to the market at Indian Key—and the cultivators of the soil do and must procure their supplies from the same market.
One Store on this Island sold in the last twelve months merchandise to the amount of twenty five thousand dollars. One fourth part of this sum was purchased by residents on the main-land—the remaining three fourths by inhabitants of the Keys, and by vessels who resort here for supplies. Already seven vessels are owned at this Port—Including these, the whole number that rendezvous here, is over twenty.
There have been already built here one good wharf and warehouse—another extensive ware-house will be erected in the ensuing Winter.
We have additional reasons for asking—and some that deeply concern may who reside remote from this Island. Much the greatest part of Court & Customs House business in this District originates in the disasters that so frequently occur in navigating these seasand more than three fourths of these accidents take place in the vicinity of Indian Key. Hence more than three fourths of the business of the Custom House and Court of the District could be transacted here advantageously for all parties concerned.
Under the existing state of things, property to a very large amount and many vessels are lost which were there a Custom House here would be saved, The reasons are obvious.—So much time is now unavoidably consumed in transporting that portion of cargo first saved from a wrecked vessel to Key West that often the residue of cargo left on board and the vessel itself is irretrievably lost before the wrecker can return. Whereas, were this a Port of Entry, the Wrecker could make several trips between the vessel in distress and the Public Store in less time than he can make one to Key West. To prevent as far as possible this waste and distruction of property, the wreckers have in many instances landed the cargos Saved on this Key, and it has occasionally happened that both vessel and cargo have been wholly lost in navigating from Indian Key to the Port of Entry.
We utterly disclaim any intention or wish to abrogate or curtail the privileges of any place or persons—but we deem it right to say, that when a Custom House was asked for on this coast, Indian Key was scarcely known. Had its local advantages and central situation been as well understood then as they now are, a Port of Entry would have been established here rather than at any other port or place on this coast. Nature evedently intended this for the sea-port and rallying point of business for all that portion of the Main from Indian River to Cape Sable and for the Keys & Islands to windward of Bay Honda Harbour, 

July 23th 1833.
We the undersigned Citizens of the United States having examined the foregoing representations, and believing that favorable results will follow from the establishment of a Port of Entry & Deposit at Indian Key, do therefore pray that the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Of America in Congress assembled will forthwith make the flourishing settlement of Indian Key in Florida a Port of Entry and Deposit and establish a Custom House there.*

SIR, I have the honor to inform you, by direction of the Secretary of War, that the authority, given to Col° Gadsden to carry into effect the treaty with Blunt's band of October 11" 1832, has been revoked at his own request,” and the execution of that duty is confided to you.
As a Specific Sum has been appropriated to defray all the expenses of exploring, removal and Subsistence,” these Indians will make their own arrangements. When you are satisfied, that they really intend to emigrate, and they “have completed their preparations, 

and commenced the removal of their whole party,” you will pay to them the Ten thousand dollars, stipulated for the 2" Article of the treaty, and for which you are hereby authorized to draw.
Col° Gadsden has suggested that the months of Sept October and November will be the most favorable Season for emigrating, as prior to that time, there is reason to apprehend disease on the river and Storms on the Coast; and as the Cholera has appeared this year at the port, at which the Indians must embark. If your views should coincide with those of Col° Gadsden, you will advise the Indians to remain until that time, and avoid the dangers to which they would be exposed by an earlier removal.—

Our Court here has just closed a most arduous session, three weeks of which were entirely occupied in the investigation of Land Causes.
Several cases were argued and submitted, and considerable progress was made in others; no decision however has yet been made. We took up cases of different classes, so that when a decision does take place in any one case, it will have a material bearing upon a large class of cases. This will be the case with one of them particularly, which embraces the question whether the Certificates of Tomas de Aguilar, late Secretary of the Spanish Government of this Province, imports absolute verity, and when attached to Documents purporting to be copies of grants for land, are to be taken as full proof that an original once existed, when no such original can now be found, and there is no proof that it ever did exist, except what is afforded by such certificate itself. There are more than twenty cases of this class embracing about half a million of acres of land, and it was agreed by the Counsel that the testimony taken in this case (much of which goes to prove the usage and custom of the province in matters of this kind) might be offered in any other case, subject to all such legal objections as could be made to it, if originally taken and offered in such other case.
A very full investigation was had, which will save much time and expence in other cases.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor herewith to transmit a copy of a request of many of the principal citizens of this place relative to the reconstruction of the Sea wall at and near Fort Marion”—together with the intended answer. This request has since been withdrawn in consequence of representations made by me to the inhabitants. I am therefore prepared to proceed as rapidly as possible with the reconstruction of the Sea wall.
Under the instructions of the Department that no modifications of the Fort shall be made, I feel it my duty to state that it is uninhabitable by troops on account of the confined state of the atmosphere within

it;—(consequently it has not been inhabited by them for many years);
and that nothing more will be requisite for its repairs than the recovering of the ramparts with a new terrace at an expense not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars (it will then only be useful as a place of deposit for stores), with the exception of the re-building of the three angles of the outwork fronting on the river as specified in the drawing and remarks previously transmitted. I have not yet been able to procure the materials for completing the drawings on a larger scale than that already transmitted; but shall in all probability be able to transmit them by the 30" of September with a detailed statement of the facts relative to the work. Much disappointment exists relative to my construction of the law making the appropriation but at present my views seem to have been concurred in by the Mayor and Corporation of this place, as well as by a Majority of the Citizens.

On Feb. 1, 1834 (loc. cit., T 2261), he reported on the reconstruction of the sea wall which had been hindered by bad weather. Numerous other letters from Tuttle written in 1833 and 1834 are loc. cit. See H. Exec.

<docbody>HON LEWIS CASS, Secretary of War, SIR, I have the honor to state to you that in July last past the account of Major John Phagan, Agent for the Seminole Indians, Florida, was reported to this Office for examination & allowance.
Of the vouchers exhibited by Major Phagan, twelve were found to have been so altered as to increase their aggregate amount. Three hundred ninety seven dollars & fifty cents beyond that expressed in them orriginally. Major Phagan claimed to have the amount of these twelve vouchers as increased by the alteration, passed to his credit. Upon inspecting these vouchers I deemed it proper to institute an enquiry as to the facts in relation to them, before deciding upon the propriety of passing them to Major Phagans credit—Major Phagans account was suspended, and letters written to the persons who furnished the Supplies, requesting them to state the amount they received of Major Phagan, refering to the time when, and the occasion for which the articles were purchased & paid for. I have received answers from three of the persons written to, to wit, Kerr
& Sturges, Thomas Brown, & Robert May J Kerr & Sturgis are unable to state the precise sum they received of Major Phagan, but observe “If the bill is forwarded to them they can tell if correct”.—
Mr Brown states that, on the 3" of October 1832 he supplied the Indians in charge of Major Jn" Phagan & at his request, with articles to the amount of $21.87% & that on the 7 of the same month Major Phagan paid him that Sum. The voucher produced by Major Phagan for these supplies, was orriginally for $21.87% but when present by him for allowance, was altered to $26.87%. Mr May in his answer states that, the Sum received by him of Major Jn” Phagan for the passage of an Interpreter & Seven Indians was fifty dollars.
The receipt produced by Major Phagan for these passages, agrees as to the number of persons transported, and orriginally was for fifty dollars, but as presented by Major Phagan for allowance was altered to $100–
All which is respectfully submitted for your consideration—

<place-time>S*Augustine of FLORIDA Aug 29" 1833.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, Your favor of the 6" inst informs me,” that you have learned, upon enquiry, “that the decision to which exception is taken, has upon full consideration, been sanctioned by the President”—and you add—
“thus sustained, whatever might be my own views of the subjects, I
should not feel myself at liberty to interfere.”
I am sorry, Sir, to broach you further upon this subject, but it appears to me, from your letter, that the President may have decided, without a view of the Proofs and considerations submitted in my correspondence with you.
I cannot help entertaining the opinion, that upon considering the letters of General Call and M. Douglas and the well attested fact, that the land claims within my jurisdiction are nearly twenty times as many as the existing number in the other three Districts put together—I
say I cannot avoid thinking, that with a perfect knowledge of the facts of the case, the President would consider me (whatever might be the doubt or difficulty in relation to the claims of the other Judges) entitled to the additional compensation provided by Law. May I ask, therefore, as an act of justice, that my letters to you with the documents accompanying them be submitted at some moment of leisure to the President. I am very unwilling to claim the attention of the President, even for a moment, for I am aware of the infinitely more important public concerns in which he is engaged, but when it is remembered that I am suffering some inconveniences from this unexpected decision, & that I strongly entertain a conviction that I am entitled to an appropriation made by a public Law—I trust for these reasons, I may not be considered pertinacious or intrusive. Having the greatest veneration for the character of the President and the highest respect for his opinions—I shall submit cheerfully to his ultimate decision, whatever it may be; and I only add, that I am confident the other Judges of the Territory, if appealed to, would at once say (as

you will perceive Judge Randall has in effect said) that the Judge of East Florida is clearly, and in preference, entitled to the additional compensation.
In my last letter” the opinion was expressed, that the appropriation made by the Act of the last Session,” was intended for the benefit of Judge Webb & myself—but you will find that Judge Randall thinks that he and I are the Judges meant by the Statute. I take the liberty to enclose extracts from the Judges letter to me, that you may be possessed of all the information which I possess upon this subject.
Upon the subject of Land-Claims, I beg leave to state, for the information of the Department, that a chancery Term of five weeks has just ended, the greater part of which was devoted to the trial of Land Causes. Our progress in the investigation of these causes has been remarkably slow, in consequence of the practice which I found prevailing here, of receiving oral testimony and reducing it to writing in Court. Hereafter, depositions will be taken under Commission and out of Court, which will enable me to dispose of these claims quite as speedily as may comport with justice to the United States, and the claimants. Most of the cases now stand postponed by consent of Parties to July next—in order to enable the Parties to procure testimony—much of which is expected from abroad and to give an opportunity to the U.S. law agents to attend.
Before concluding this letter, I have to ask, that the checks upon Charleston in my favor may be sent to my Agents Mess” J & C.
Lawton of Charleston S. Car". If there be no objection to this, they will be furnished with authority to make the proper acknowledgement to the Treasury Department. So remote is this place and so tardy are the mails in their progress hither, that the funds sent to Charleston will be available to me some six or eight days earlier than if remitted directly here.

Judges, in finding your additional salary stopped, while overwhelmed with the business for which it was designed to be a renumeration, while there exists an Act of Congress expressly securing it to you, during the continuance of such business. From the information received from the Treasury, I presume your additional salary is also stopped, though I think there is so manifest a difference between your claim to it and that of any other Judge, as should have made your case a peculiar one, and entitled you to it even under such a provision as that in the last appropriation act. Next to your claim I think should follow mine, as [besides the Forbes case of exceeding magnitude yet pending and liable to be returned] there exists one other important claim in my district yet undecided. And I take it for granted our Districts were the two intended to be provided for—

<place-time>Office of Supt of Indian Affs in Flor: TALLAHASSEE Sept 1st 1833</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the communications of the Indian Office dated the 9th" and the 17th ultimo,”
directed to Gov: Duval. He is yet absent and the duties thereby imposed of course fall upon myself.
The first communication [MS. torn] removal of the Apalachicola Indians. In my last letter to the Dept. on this Subject I stated my belief that Blunt would be ready to go off by the 20th of July.” The Sickness on the river and other circumstances have caused a disappointment in that regard. Since then (the second week in August)
I went over to Apalachicola having appointed a meeting at M Pope the sub agent's house, & sent word to Blunt and his second chief to attend, in order to ascertain how matters stood &c. He did not attend, but sent some of his chiefs with Davy, who made a variety of excuses and gave many reasons for not having got ready as they promised. I conversed with these chiefs fully & wrote to Blunt by S. Richards the interpreter urging him to get off &c. I have the honor to enclose you his answer and also a letter from a M. S." Johns a respectable young man clerk in a store on the river.” Their letters contain the substance of what the chiefs told me [MS. torn] to every proper means in my power to get off forthwith, but from all I can learn I must say now, I [MS. torn] result this fall. No news has been yet heard from Blunts son in Kentucky. He is very anxious, especially as report states that there have been several deaths among the indian youths in the school. He should be sent home as soon as possible.
I would advise the purchase for him of the boat he requests in his letter. There is one he says on the river which he has in view. Something should be done in regard to the robberies committed upon him.
It is not for the Superintendant to decide whether Blunt is or is not entitled to (as he claims in his letter) remuneration from the Government for these robberies. He relies upon the guarrantee in the Treaty of Camp Moultrie of the peaceable possession of the reserves.
I have no doubt that he lost the money and goods he alledges. Every possible effort was adopted to bring the perpetrators of this outrage

to punishment and they were apprehended but escaped from the custody of the officer. I enclose you a Copy of a proclamation I
issued for them.” Rawls one of the robbers after his apprehension confessed the offence fully. I have a copy of his written examination.
Stafford & Oaks fled to Alabama but the latter was pursued by some persons from whom he had stolen a horse & shot dead in the woods
[MS. torn] fled to Texas. But $30 or $40 of money & goods were recovered, nor is there any probability of any more being got. The instructions of the Dep" as to his claim is respectfully requested.
The communication of the 17th above mentioned relating to Major Phagan and the public monies occasions me to go to the Seminole Agency to morrow to pay the annuity &c I have paid the Appalachicola indians some time ago—but the payment of the others has been delayed for his return. I am informed however the indians want it, and have therefore considered it best to go down at once, and M*
Sheffield the sub agent here being sick the duty is imposed upon me personally.
I enclose to the Dep" a letter from Colonel R. H Long of Jackson Co Florida respecting some negroes in Uenchattimico, Town in the Appalachicola claimed by Hawkins an Arkansas indian.” M Pope the sub Agents account of the business disagrees with Col Longs in some respect. He is now absent on leave for a few weeks in New Orleans on important private business of his own, and on his return will make a written report. From the slight examination I have made I am inclined to think the claim of Hawkins the Arkansas Indian is just and valid. The sale to Milton I consider a sham to afford facilities for their recovery merely. I would respectfully suggest that the decision of the matter be directed to be referred (as has heretofore been the course of the Dep" of War in respect to disputes as to Slaves claimed by Indians in East Florida) to the summary examination of the Judge of the District of West Florida.

<place-time>TALLAHASSEE Sept 1" 1833</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I herewith enclose you a Monthly Report of operations of improving St Marks and Ocklockney Rivers and Apalachicola Harbour for the months of July & August past. The Report of the first I
have omited till this date on account of the continued employment of putting in operation the two former works, and considerable trouble in the latter,-
The improvement of St Marks river has thus far been limited to deepening the channel at the Natural Bridge, which was found much more difficult from the nature of the excavation which was found to be almost entirely through a lime stone bed. This work is now nearly completed and the force employed will continue on the river above—
The improvement of Apalachicola Harbour has progressed rapidly beyond my expectations, considering the difficulties experienced in procuring labour: one set of Negros rebelled, nearly killed the overseer
& deserted and a set of white hands that took their places have now quit from Sickness. Nearly one fourth of the channel from the town of Apalachicola to St Georges Sound is now completed, and the whole will probably be finished sometime January.
The improvements of the Ocklockney River have progressed satisfactorily;—Nearly one hundred miles of the river has been gone over with and the logs & bending trees so completely removed as to leave the channel free at all stages of the Water. With the improvements limited by the Department to the clearing out of the channel without cutting off any of the bends, the amount already appropriated it is thought will be sufficient to carry it as high as may be found practicable. It is contemplated to continue the present force on the river as long as the appropriation will justify"—

<place-time>PENSACOLA W. F. Sep: 9th 1833</place-time>
<docbody>HON: W. J. DUANE Secretary of the Treasury U. S.
SIR. About three months since I received a letter from M*Anderson, Comptroller, informing me, that as Congress, at the last Session, had made appropriation for paying the additional salary to but two of the Judges of Florida, without specifying which two, it had been determined by the Department to pay it to none.” Viewing this determination of the Department, as bearing with peculiar severity upon me, I wrote to M' Anderson, in reply, and requested him, if necessary, to lay my letter before the head of the Department.”
Having heard nothing further from him on the subject, and as quarter day is drawing nigh, I will take the liberty of asking your attention to the matter.
The original salaries of the Judges in West, East and Middle Florida were each $1500 per An: they were required to hold a Court, twice a year, at Pensacola, S' Augustine & Tallahassee, each; and the Legislative Council of the Territory were authorized to require them to hold one other Court only in their respective Districts.”
When the Southern District was established, the salary of the Judge was fixed at $2000."
Subsequently, Congress authorized the Legislative Council to establish other Superior Courts,” which the Judges were called upon to hold. By another Act of Congress, certain Land Claims were referred to the Superior Courts for adjudication, and for this Service, the sum of $800 was added, annually, to the salary of each one of them.”
By Virtue of the Act of Congress, authorizing the Council to establish more Courts, they have proceeded from time to time, to do so, untill in the Western District, they have established Courts to be held in six Counties twice a year—in the Middle Circuit there are

seven Superior Courts annually—in the Eastern there are also seven, while the Southern has but one yet. While all the Judges are required to hold a term of the Appeal Court, of from two to four weeks in duration, once a year. Hence the duties of the Judges of the West, Middle, and East Districts have been multiplied more than four fold since the salaries were fixed—while those of the West (or my District) have been still more increased. I hold 12 Superior Courts in the year—no other Judge holds more than 7: I am compelled to travel more than 2000 miles in a year: no other Judge is compelled to travel more than 800. I have two important Admiralty Courts in my District (Pensacola and Appalachicola): no other Judge has more than one. I am compelled to be from home, for each of my Circuits, three months at a time: no other Judge is compelled to be from home, half that time.
The reason, which first governed Congress in making the addition of $800 to the salaries of the Judges—to wit, the Land Claims—still exists in the Western District. All the cases of that description are not yet disposed of: some are still before the Court for adjudication.
If it is within the Competency of the Department to make this distinction, which the Act of Congress omitted to draw, I wish very much that it should be done. In the small salary of $2300. the deduction of $800 is too serious a matter not to be felt without much severity the whole being so inadequate to the services required of me.
May I take the liberty of asking you to bring this letter to the knowledge of the President, with the view, that Congress may be requested to place the Salaries of the Florida Judges upon a footing of permanency, and proportion them to the services required of them.*
Hoping to hear from you on this subject I have the honor to be Your most ob: S*.

By the Act of February 22, 1827,” relating to the reports of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, it is provided, “That in case of the death, resignation, or dismission from office, of either of the Officers before mentioned, the said copies of the decisions delivered to them, as aforesaid, shall belong, and be delivered over, to their Successors in said offices.”—It does not appear that there is any similar provision in regard to any other books, or documents forwarded to the Judges of the United States' Courts, but as far as the Department is informed, no objection has been made to their delivery in the same manner.—

been predicated upon an estimate furnished by the State Department, I have thought the best mode of ascertaining the fact, would be an application to you.

<docbody>COLONEL JAMES GADSDEN, Wacessa, near Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 5th Ultimo,” in relation to the repair of the road from Pensacola to Tallahassee and thence to Saint Augustine. The appropriations hitherto made have been so intirely inadequate to the objects for which they were intended, that I am not surprised at the dissappointment and dissatisfaction expressed by the Citizens of Florida in regard to their application-
Where sums so small were to be expended over so great a distance, it is scarcely to be wondered at, that those who superintended their application should have been sometimes mistaken as to the proper points to be improved. I have always considered the application of appropriations so small, to so great an extent of road, as an utter waste of money. Apart from the accommodation which a good road would afford to the inhabitants of the Country, there are sufficient military reasons why liberal appropriations should be made, and the road between the several posts in Florida placed in such a state as to afford the most rapid communication. From the numerous

F L Q R J D A 7" E R R H TO R Y 889
small islands in the vicinity of Florida, and the numerous small Bays along its extensive coast, easy access to it will at all times be afforded to the enemy which we shall at no distant day have to encounter—I
allude to the population of the West Indies; for the course pursued by the British Government must have the effect, in a short period, to place the whole of our West India possessions, as well as those of Spain, in the hands of the negroes—When that time shall arrive, cultivation must in a great measure cease, and the white, as well as the coloured, population, must seek some other mode of subsistence—
Piracy and depradation upon our Southern Coasts seems to me to be their only alternative, and I think a prudent forecast should prompt us to prepare, by every means in our power, for such a state of things.
I shall ask for an appropriation, at the approaching session of Congress, sufficient to put the military road in a complete state of repair—Should I obtain it, I propose to avail myself of your offer to direct the improvement in your immediate neighborhood.

<docbody>TO JAMES D. WESTCOTT, J" Esq.' Tallahassee, Florida, SIR, Your letter of the 1" Ult" with its several enclosures has been received."
There appears to be great reluctance on the part of Blunt and his adherents to remove according to their Agreement—You will however not relax your efforts to start them in time to arrive at their Western home before the cold weather sets in.
Before the receipt of your letter Col° Gadsden was instructed to purchase a boat for Blunt and to present it to him as a gift from the Government.
The Department has no authority to repair the injury sustained by him on account of the robbery you Speak of—Congress alone can give relief; and that body would be full as likely to listen to his application after his removal as before. His place of residence cannot affect the merits of his claim.
In the month of June last the Superintendent of the Choctaw Academy was instructed to send Blunt's son home," and any other Indian Boys that might be at School there and belonging to the Towns

of Blunt and Davy—On the receipt of your letter the instruction was repeated * and, I presume, will immediately attended to.
According to your recommendation, and conformably to the former practice of the Department in similar cases, you will cause the examination and decision of the conflicting title to the negro Slaves, spoken of in your letter, to be referred to the Judge of the District of West Florida.—

Herring finally instructed Henderson, Oct. 31, 1833 (loc. cit., Lets. Sent, Bk. 10), that if the boy could not be identified all of the Florida group should be returned.

The Contractors having failed, no part of the appropriation will be paid to them, but you will apply it in the repair of the most difficult parts of the road in the manner in which, to your judgement may seem best. If you think it advisable to do so, a part of it may be applied to erecting a Bridge and making a causeway in the neighborhood of the proposed arsenal, recommended by Captain Hills, by which the distance will be considerably shortened, and better ground, it is said, obtained. Captain Hills will point out the place to you. Do nothing by Contract if you can possibly avoid it—the object of contractors is to do as little, and get as much as possible.”

<docbody>SIR/ Waste and trespass upon the lands of the United States within this District, has become so great recently, that I deem it necessary that I should give information consering it, and of asking Your particular instructions as to the course I should pursue.
I have no doubt that, at this time, no less than forty saw-mills, some of them large establishments, are furnished with timber from the pine lands of the Government within this District, and from their rapid multiplication, it is quite probable, that in the course of another year that number will be doubled—
I am Sensible, to be sure, that Such things Should not be permitted, but in as much as the people heretofore, not only in this but other Districts of the Territory, have been Suffered to commit waste upon the public domain, with impunity, they now think their right and the officer who now interfear, would not only bring upon himself their ill-will, but be charged with doing that which it was not his duty to do.
No Suit or proceeding of any kind has ever been instituted by any predecessor of mine, in relation to this Subject, nor has there ever been any Such, as I have been told, in the other portions of the Territory:
Withouy therefore, positive instructions, or the example of others, Similarly Situated, I am quite at a loss to know what I Should do—

Should you think fit to address me on the Subject, I desire that I
shall be particularly instructed, whether I shall commence Suits for the damage done, or only take Such Steps as will prevent future Waste I have the honor to be respectfully Your Ob. Se'

<docbody>TO, THE HONB" R. B.

It cannot be expected, that at such a distance you should know any thing of this Bank—permit me therefore to add, it was Chartered by the last Legislative Council for a period of Thirty Years ”—with a Capital of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars a large portion of which is held by citizens of Baltimore among whom is a number of your personal friends;–They will furnish the security above alluded to, but in order fully to satisfy your mind on this subject I would respectfully refer you to Evan Poultney Esq. Prest. of the Bank of Maryland, or Jessee Hunt Esq Mayor of the City of Baltimore.
The want of a place of public Deposit in Florida has long been felt and complained of by the Officers of Government. At present the monies collected at the Land offices and Customs have to be transmitted to some office of the U. S. Bank in the adjoining States at

great risk and cost to the officers—And the requisitions of the Treasury have again to be drawn at a like risk and expence.
The location of the Commercial Bank is peculiarly fortunate—
about Equa-distant between the east and western boundaries—with a constant communication by Sea with Key-West and all the Ports in the Gulph—with the interior, Alabama, and Georgia, as high as Fort Mitchell, and Columbus, by the Steam Boats daily—with all parts of the Teritory by the Mail Stages from Pensacola to St. Augustine, which intersect the Steam Boats with the U. S. Mail for this place twice a week at Mount Vernon. -
Those are facilities, to those having business with the Bank, which no other situation in the Teritory can present, and no doubt will receive your consideration in selecting an Agent for Florida.”

President of the Central Bk of Florida" located in this City has informed me that the Directors of his Bk have instructed him to solicit the designation of it as the depository of the public monies in Florida and the transaction by it of the business of the U S Treasury here generally. The public receipts in Florida are much less than the Expenditures. I presume the amount of all the annual receipts in Florida do not & will not for some years exceed $100.000. The disbursements are greatly beyond that amount.
The amount annually disbursed at this City for the expenses of the Territorial legislature & Government.-salaries of judicial officers, expenses of Courts—indian annuities &c. &c. will be between thirty
& forty thousand dollars for two or three years hence. There are other expences in this—(the Middle District) such as repairs of roads by the Qr. M. Genl—improvement of harbours rivers & other public works under special appropriations by the Eng’ Dept: &c which are

not included in this estimate All the expenditures in the Eastern, Southern, & Western Districts are also included. Those at Pensacola by the Navy Agent must be considerable. The Selection of the Central Bk as the Treasury Agent for Middle Florida including Appalachicola will I think be Safest for the Treasury, and a great convenience to the Territorial government and its officers & creditors here. I have no interest in this bank but I do not hesitate strongly to recommend its selection by the Treasury. Its credit is unquestionable and its safety undoubted. Its stockholders and directors are the most wealthy, Substantial, prudent, and permanent of our citizens. In fact while I have perfect confidence in it, its stockholders and officers I feel it my bounden duty to declare that there is not another bank established in Florida, or about to be established, the bills of which I would take in payment of a professional fee of $200
and keep them a week at my own risque.”

<docbody>SIR, In reply to your note of yesterday,” I have the honour to state, that I am unacquainted with the habits manners and moral character of the intruders upon the public lands in the Western District of Florida, but if they are such as characterise the frontier settlers of the West, any civil remedy, either to eject or for damages, would, in my opinion, be found inadequate, if not totally ineffectual.
In the cases mentioned in M* Walkers letter, of intruders in Florida, In my opinion, a civil remedy would be found unavailing. If resorted to, it is more than probable that someone of the jury would reside within the influence or convenience of one of those Mills, in which case, he would not agree to any vidict which would, in its consequences, eject the defendant or subject him to damages. I would, therefore, recommended that the intruders be removed by the Marshall. I
will further say, as this is a subject which forms no part of my official

duty, I have not given that attention which I should otherwise have done, and this note is, therefore, unofficial.”

<docbody>SIR, Immediately after my arrival at this place your letter of introduction” made me acquainted with the Register and Receiver of public moneys, and I proceeded to an examination of the condition of their Offices. It is with much regret that I am compelled to state that the Receiver's books and papers are in a very confused situation.
In the Ledger there are neither debits nor credits entered in his account with the United States Since December 1831; but as no sale of public land appears to have been made since that period, and as he admits having received his salary from Washington, and as he assures me that his account was fully adjusted at the seat of Government last Summer, I must presume that you have been satisfied of the accuracy of his Statements. The last sale which appears upon the Receiver's books was made 9" November 1831. but it appears by the books of the Register that a sale was made of 160 acres a few weeks since but no entry is yet made of it by the Receiver. The first sale made at this Office was to Reuben Charles of 80 acres at
$1.25/100 per acre; the amount of this sale has never been credited to the United States on the Ledger altho' the Receiver assures me that it has been accounted for to the Government, yet he has no voucher to prove the fact. The circumstances above stated will account for

the absence in this report of any account current or account of moneys on hand at this Office, but as the salaries payable to the Register and Receiver exceed six times the amount of sales of the public Lands at this Office I presume that the Treasury Department will always hold a sufficient pecuniary check upon the Receiver. The total amount of sales at this Office since its establishment has been one thousand five hundred and sixty eight dollars and fifty five Cents, being in payment for 1255 acres of Land. With a knowledge of this fact it will not be difficult to adjust the Receivers account since the Commencement of his official career.
There having been but twelve sales of land I deemed it proper to examine all of them through all their stages in the Books, papers, &
plats in both Offices. I found six of them on the Journal which did not correspond with those on the Register of Receipts—the errors I had corrected. - s With regard to the Register's Office, as I have stated above that I examined every entry of Land through all its stages, it is only necessary to say that I found them all perfectly correct, and the Books & papers kept in a manner highly creditable to that Officer.
The Receiver's furniture is a pine table worth about $3 & the Register's a pine table and a book case worth about $10.
Against the general conduct & character of the Register & Receiver I heard no complaints.

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs October 31, 1833</place-time>
TO HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, It appears from communications addressed to the Department,” that the Indian Chief Blunt and his associates make objections to leave Florida, and manifest an unwillingness to comply with their late Treaty.
Col° Gadsden has represented to the Department, that he was opposed to treating separately with the Appalachicola Bands, but

that the importunity of Blunt prevailed upon him to forego his objection. In pursuance of the Treaty subsequently made with him Three thousand dollars have been advanced to that Band, and the residue of the money due for their land will be paid according to Stipulation.
You will please to give notice to Blunt and his party, that the Government will insist upon the faithful performance of their Treaty, and that no possible consideration can change that determination.
By adverting to that Treaty you will perceive, that if unavoidable circumstances should prevent their removal by the first of November next, they would be permitted to remain some time, not exceeding however another year. If therefore the present season has so far progressed, that their removal cannot now be effected without serious inconvenience to them, their departure may be delayed until next Spring or Summer. In case of their refusal to go, the enforcement of the Treaty will devolve upon your Excellency.
You will inform Blunt and the other two Chiefs who signed the Treaty, that the Government will hold them responsible for the departure of their whole Band, stated to consist of Two hundred and fifty persons—that they will not be permitted to break their engagement by residing among the other Bands, nor on any account to remain in Florida.
You will also make Known to the Chiefs of the other Bands, that they will not be allowed to secrete or protect any persons belonging to Blunt's Band; but that if they take refuge within their Towns or territorial limits they must be driven away.
You will also procure the testimony, substandiating the robbery of Blunts’ property by our own Citizens, and forward it without delay, that application may be made to Congress for his relief—Care must be taken to have the amount of the loss or theft correctly stated.
If however Congress should not at the ensuing Session pass an act for his relief, it will not afford good ground for violating his Treaty. His residence will not affect the justice of his Claim, and reparation will be as readily extended to him West of the Mississippi as in Florida.”—
I have the honor &c., ELBERT HERRING.

The entries in the Ledger of Sales are up to the 30" September
1833.” but no additions have been made Since 30" June 1828 with a few exceptions and they are noted in pencil marks. The Register's Son (who is de facto Register) promised me that these omissions should be promptly supplied and should not occur again. The tract books have been opened in the numerical order prescribed by the General Land Office.
I made a comparison between the Tract book & township plat and having early discovered one error I was induced to occupy much time in further investigation & I believe with that one exception (which was promptly corrected) the Tract book & township plat are in accordance with each other. Two desks worth about $30 is the furniture of the Register's Office & one desk and one iron chest worth about $110. is the furniture of the Receiver's Office.

The truth is I boarded the said Vessel three miles from the Port while she was dischargeing on board the mail steam Boat, and finding she contained nothing but domestic produce, and there being no certificates to be taken up nor any other duty to be performed by me.—

the case. which I believe would not have been done had the Secretary been correctly informed by a true statement of the real facts appertaining to my situation connected also with the circumstances so universally prevalant all over the country of Post Masters holding at the same time other offices the duties of which are not incompatible with that of the principle inforced by the late secretary in my case would at once disfranchise a very largue proportion of the Post Masters in the United States. and must be attended with very serious inconveneance to the Government and the country, since a contrary costom has always prevailed In this Territory alone there are numerous instances of Post Masters holding at the same time another office.
(to wit) The P. M. at Tallahassee is also a clerk in the Surveyer Genlis office with a sallary of a $1000."—Also the Surveyor the Port of St: Marks" and the Inspector at Tampa Bay" are also Post Masters at those offices others might be mentioned of minor consequence-
My pay as Inspector is only $750 and the emoluments of the Post Office do not exceed $200 per annum—We have only a weekly mail, and the time occupied in opening and closing is not more than three hours. I have also a competent deputy who attends to the P. Office when I am occupied by my duties as Inspector. In such an unhealthy and expensive situation as Appalachicola it is very obvious that the joint emoluments of the two offices is barely sufficiant to support my family. From 4 to 5 months during the year there prevails a most malignant fever which carries away a large proportion of the inhavitants and all who are able, abandon the place during the sickly season.
—Under such circumstances I never would have been induced to accept the offices in question and to continue at all seasons at the peril of my life to discharge the duties of both nearly for the scanty support they have heretofore furnished. The consideration was entirely prospective, and I was willing to endure and have continued to endure a perrillous probation with the distant prospect of remuneration when the offices should become profictable. It cannot therefore but be considered as an extream hardship indeed to be compelled to surrender one of the offices so essential to my support, and without any inconveniance or neglect resulting either to the Post office or the Revenue by reasons as above stated-

SIR I herewith enclose you a Monthly Report of the operations of improving Apalachicola Harbour St Marks Harbour & river &
Ocklockney River for the Month of October 1833
The channel of the St. Marks River has been opened to the point at first contemplated, so as to be navigable at the high stages of the Water. There are many places yet requiring to be deepened for this navigation to render it free as it was in the first estimate designed, for which the estimate was made in the Annual Estimate for an additional appropriation—The work is now suspended: the appropriations heretofore made with the exception of a small balance having been expended–
The work of clearing the Ocklockney River of obstructions has also been suspended from the expenditure of the appropriation for that purpose, with the exception of a small balance The River has been cleared of obstructions so that small Steam Boats may ply on it at high water for about 150 miles from its mouth.
The accompanying Report exhibits the expenditures for this improvement—
The Dredging of the Straight Channel at Apalachicola progresses prosperously and promises the greatest success, subject however to the many interruptions by storms & bad weather, and being frequently deserted by the hands employed, who from the high wages in the town cannot be had at any fair rates on board of the boats.
Without any unusual interruption further it is hoped that the cut will be effected by Feby, next. The current of the water washes the channel to 12 & 14 feet in debth as soon as the crust of hard sand is cut from the bed and gives the water action on the blue clay bed which lies under it. It is the success of this work that induced me to recommend the attempt to remove the outer bar at St Marks Harbour to admit vessels of greater draught than those now in the trade of the place.

<place-time>[November 4, 1833]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States—
The Memorial of the undersigned Citizens of the County of Escambia in the Territory of Florida respectfully represents—
That the salary of the Judge of the Western District of Florida is wholly inadequate for his support, and by no means commensurate with the services he is required, by Law to perform—that the duties of the said Judge are much more arduous than those of any other judge in Florida, and greatly exceed those required of the District Court Judges in Alabama Louisiana or Mississippi—
Your Memorialists respectfully represent unto your Honorable Bodies, that at the time of the organization of the Territorial Government, and at which time the salary was fixed at $1500, the Judge was only required to hold Courts twice during the year, at Pensacola and at one other place in the district to be designated by the Legislative Council *—that subsequent acts of Congress have authorized the Legislative Council to compel the Judge to hold Courts at such places and at such times as the said Council shall direct—that a Court of Appeals has also been authorized by act of Congress" to be held by all the Judges of Florida at Tallahassee, once a yearand that in pursuance of said acts of Congress and the powers so given, the Legislative Council have organized a Court of Appeals to be held by all the Judges once a year, and Six Superior Courts in the District of West Florida which the Judge of this district is required to hold twice a year—
Your Memorialists would further represent that it was ascertained several years since, when the number of Courts in the Territory, and more especially in the Western District were not half as numerous

as they now are, that the salary of the Judges were inadequate, and your Honorable Body in order to supply the deficiency, allowed an extra Compensation to each of the Judges of $800 annually, for the adjudication of Land Claims; at the last Session of Congress this extra allowance was directed to be Continued to two of the Judges only,” but as the act did not designate which two, the Officers of the Treasury Department have we understand, declined paying it to any of them,” and thus, none of them have received it though there are land claims still existing in all the Districts, as we thélerstand learn. We know it to be the case in West Florida—
Your memorialists respectfully represent to your Honorable Bodies the propriety and necessity of placing the salaries of all the Judges of Florida upon a permanent and liberal footing: they believe that the salaries of all of them are inadequate, but more especially that of the Judge of the Western District. He is required to hold terms of Court in six Counties twice during the year, and to attend the Court of Appeals at Tallahassee annually. The time required in holding said Courts and in travelling to and from them, through a new Country with a sparse population, exceeds six months in the year, while the distance travelled, annually is upwards of 2000 miles—Disclaiming any intention or wish to draw an invidious distinction, your memorialists think, nevertheless that the justice of increasing the salary of the Judge of the Western District will be more apparent by a slight comparison of his duties and services with those of the other Judges in Florida. While he is required to hold 12 Courts in the year, besides the Court of Appeals, and to travel more than 2000 miles in doing so, and be absent from his family more than six months in the year—the Judge of the Middle District has only about 500 miles to travel and to hold terms of Court in only four Counties together with the Court of Appeals—the Judge of the Eastern District has to hold Court but in four Counties, and the Court of Appeals, and to travel between 800 & 1000 miles, and the Judge of the Southern District has to hold Court for one County only, and to travel to and from the Court of Appeals—The Judge of the Western District has moreover two places in his district, to wit, Pensacola and Appalachicola where he will be compelled to hold extra terms for the trial of Admiralty cases; and more especially at Appalachicola, which is becoming one

of the most commercially important places on the Gulf of Mexico and in the Course of a few years, will almost rival Mobile. In holding the said Courts at Appalachicola, the Judge is necessarily subjected to great risks and heavy expenses, from the difficulty of getting to Appalachicola, and from its great distance from Pensacola, his necessary place of residence—The other Judges in the Territory have only one point in each of their districts where Admiralty business can possibly arise, and those places are in the immediate vicinity of their respective residences, while the Courts of Pensacola and Appalachicola are each important Admiralty Courts—each within the Western District, and distant the one from the other, more than 300
Miles—
Your memorialists would respectfully call the attention of your Honorable Bodies to the fact of the very extensive jurisdiction and multifarious duties of the Superior Courts of this Territory, and of the importance of having the Salaries of the Judges such as would induce Gentlemen of proper legal qualifications and attainments to accept and retain the office–To have and to keep such Judges is not only important to the people, but to the Government. Your memorialists further represent that in addition to the duties imposed upon the Judges by the several acts of Congress, they are required to inforce (exclusively) the entire Criminal Code of the Territory—
originally or by appeal the Civil Code, and to keep the Court of Chancery always open for the purpose of making interlocutory decrees, hearing motions &C so that the presence of the Judge is always indispensable in his district—
Your memorialists would most respectfully suggest that the duties required of the Judge of the Western District of Florida are much more arduous than those required of the Judge of the Eastern District of Louisiana, and that he ought in the humble apprehension of your memorialists, at least to be entitled to the same Compensation—
Your Memorialists therefore pray your Honorable Bodies to pass an act directing the Eight hundred Dollars of extra salary for the year 1833 to be paid to the Judge of the Western District as well as to all the Judges of Florida and to increase the permanent salary of the Judge of the Western District to such sum as would be a fair equivalent for the services required of him—The Amount of Compensation must of Course be left to the Wisdom of Congress, but we hope to escape the imputation of presumption, if we suggest $3000 as being nothing

more than a just equivalent for his services—And your memorialists as in duty bound will every pray &c”—

SIR, I have received from George Walker Esq U. States Attorney for West Florida, a letter bearing date the 14" October 1833” which I have the honour to send enclosed, in which he informs me that extensive Waste & Trespass have been committed on the pine lands, belonging to the Government in West Florida, and that forty sawmills are supplied with timber from these lands. He asks instructions as to the course he shall take.
Having understood from the Commissioner of the General land Office, that his experience is, that suits for Trespass on Public lands are generally fruitless & leave heavy Bills of Costs for the U. States to pay, I addressed him an unofficial note on the subject,” that I might by a written answer, have in writing, to be laid before you, the result of his experience." I sent enclosed Copies of my letter &
his answer. From the latter you will perceive that it is his opinion, that a civil remedy would be found unavailing; And recommends that the intruders should be removed by the Marshal. From Opinions heretofore given by Attorney General of the U. States, there is no doubt this extraordinary remedy is applicable to trespassers for the Purpose of waste as well as settlement.
As the proceeding by force to eject the intruders under the Act of the 3" of March 1807 entitled “An Act to prevent settlements being made on lands ceded to the U. States, until authorised by law”,”
is entirely under the direct authority of the President of the U. States.
I have the honor to send the above mentioned letters to you & to submit to your decision, whether you will order the Marshal to remove the intruders in question, or the District Attorney be directed to institute suits of ejectment & for damages against them.”
I have the honor to be With the highest respect Sir, Your Mo Obt Sevt VIRGIL MAXCY Solicitor of the Treasury TO/ ANDREW JACKSON President of the United States.

<docbody>SIR. On yesterday I advised the Department of my return from the Appalachicola Towns which I had visited with the Agent Genl Thompson to attend to the execution of the treaty with Blunt and Davy," and I promised to communicate by this mail the particulars to the Dept:
Blunt and Davy with Stephen Richards the interpreter visited me at this place on the 27th of October and had a full conversation with the agent and myself. They still complained greatly of the last Treaties concluded by Colonel Gadsden with the Upper Towns.
Blunt and Davy again stated to me that their people were leaving them and going to the Upper Towns and to the Creek Nation, and among the Seminoles, and that my instructions to the sub agent and my orders sent to the other chiefs to send their indians home were disregarded. They complained that good faith had not been observed towards them in as much as they were assured when they made their treaty that all proper efforts should be used to get the other Towns to go with them. Blunt also complained that he had not received remuneration for the robberies by the whites of his property since the treaty.
A memorandum of the conversation will be inclosed to the Dept by General Thompson by this mail."

The last difficulty was as will be seen by the memorandum easily obviated. I assured him if the Govt: should allow him any thing it should be sent to him to the nearest U.S. fort or post to his residence.
I refer the Department particularly to this memorandum of your conversation on this subject as it may be important hereafter.
To remedy the first complaint I appointed the 9th instant to visit the towns and hold a talk with the indians and see that matters were all set right and my orders obeyed.
When I got there I found that the Sub Agent had just come home after an absence of nearly three months in Louisiana. I knew of his visit but not of his protracted absence and could not account for not having heard from him.
Gen: Thompson the agent being introduced to the indians in Council gave them the talk of which a copy will also be inclosed by him to the Dept.
Their reply will be also inclosed by him at the same time.
To remedy the complaint of Blunt in regard to good faith not having been observed towards him as aforesaid I consented to address a letter for Yellow Hair to the President " which is inclosed in another communication by the same mail with this.
General Thompson by my instructions paid Blunt & Davy $1500
as I advised the Dept by last mail. I am confident our course in this respect will be approved.
The Creek agent and Colonels Abert & Bright have been written to respecting our runaways to the Creek nation and furnished with a list of their names &c Those is in the Seminole Nation have been ordered up home and those in the Upper Towns been sent out.
Nothing now exists to delay the departure of Blunt and Davy with the principal portion of their people but the absence at the indian school in Ky of the boys belonging to their Towns. They will not stir a step however till the boys arrive, but are prepared to go off immediately on their arrival I have written to “Colonel R. M. Johnson or the Supt. of the Indian school at Great Crossing” “Ky” on that subject a copy of which I
inclose." I beg that the Department will renew the instructions given on that subject some time since. All the boys from the Appalachicola towns should be sent home as speedily as possible. Blunt and his party are incurring heavy expenses daily and if the return of the boys is delayed beyond the middle of Jany. I am afraid of continued delay in the embarkation. While at Appalachicola I pro-

cured a list of the boys now at the school in Ky which is inclosed annexed to the copy of the letter to Colonel Johnson. I would suggest that the best route home is by Nashville Ten: Huntsville Ala to Columbus Ga and thence to M* Vernon Fa by Steam Boat when they are but a few miles from home.
It will be necessary for the Department to decide what amount will be due Blunt & Davy for the advance of annuity and to transmit the funds or authority to draw therefor to the Executive of Florida by the time the boys arrive.
Should Yellow Hairs proposition be acceeded to, funds must also be transmitted to pay his party at the same time. I respectfully suggest that the rule I have proposed in a State ment of population
&c forwarded to M.” Herring be adopted for the ascertainment of the amount of annuity to be paid the emigrants—deducting for those who remain behind—and that the same proportion also of the $10,000
to be paid to Blunt & Davy be deducted. I have notified him he would not be paid for those who did not go.
Blunt has requested me (as his friend) to write to New Orleans to know what rifles can be got for—and he intends to have 100 sent down to the Baleze for his party with also considerable goods. As this will not be done till he is about starting Yellow Hairs can be purchased at the same time if his proposition is agreed to and if the Executive here is advised so to do by the Department.
I would suggest the authority to the Governor here to appoint an agent to go along with Blunt and Davy to the mouth of the Sabine to protect them & their party from the depredations of scoundrel who may meet them along the coast and rob them or force them to violence. He can select a trustworthy white man for $250 the trip.
I trust the Dept will be satisfied I have done my duty in this business I know I have left nothing undone in my power to perform, But I am gratified that the arrival of Gov. Duval which is hourly expected will afford the Government the benefit of his better judgment, and riper experiences."
I have the honor to be Sir Your Most obt:hble Sert:

SIR. As promised in my letter of acceptance addressed to you &
dated I think the 14" of September last,” I set out from my residence on the 8" of October last, and arrived in Tallahassee on the 17" at night. Early the succeeding morning I reported myself to the Acting Govenor of the Territory (the Govenor was then absent) who instructed me to remain in Tallahassee a fiew Weeks to aid him in carrying into effect the Treaty with John Blunt and Davy Elliott Chiefs of a band of Appalachicola Indians. On the 28" of October he instructed me to accompany him to Wacca Pachassies Reserve on the Appalachicola for the purpose of meeting the Indians in Council on the 9" of November then ensuing, and pay to John Blunt & Davy Elliott the sum of $3000, to aid in makeing arrangements necessary to itheir emigration—Preparitory to the contemplated payment he drew on the War Department in my favour as Agent for the Florida Indians, for the whole Sum ($10000) Stipulated to be paid to those Chiefs when they shall commence the removal of their whole band—On further reflection it was concluded that $2000 would be ample for the purpose then contemplated. The Central Bank of Florida had agreed to Cash the Draft I therefore drew that sum from the Bank leaveing
$8000 standing to my credit. Haveing met the Chiefs at the Appointed time," it was concluded that $1500 instead of $2000 would be sufficient to prepare the outfit of Blunt and his band, which latter amount I paid to Blunt & Elliott and took Duplicate receipts one of which you have enclosed—The remaining $500 I deposited to my credit in the Bank on my return to Tallahassee makeing an aggregate deposite in the Bank of $8500–

On the 23" of November Ul" His Excellency Governor Duvall who had then recently arrived in the Territory instructed me to proceed to the Agency and take possession of the Office," records papers &c and return to Tallahassee by the first of January ensuing, for the purpose of carrying the Treaty with Blunt & Elliott into full & final effect. Blunt awaits the arrival of his son from the Indian School in Kentucky, nor will consent to go without him. It is therefore important that this boy, and indeed the other Indian boys from the Appalachicola Towns be immediately sent home Blunt at one time seemed somewhat disposed not to go untill he should receive an allowance of the money of which he was robbed; but on being made to understand that Congress alone was competent to make the allowance which if made could be transmitted to him, he appointed Mr HV Snell of Tallahassee reputed a young Gentleman of moral worth, as his Attorney to superintend the prosecution of his claim—
I arrived here last evening and found the Agency House untenanted except by a Single individual—a mechanic by the name of Dunlap –
The Office door was secured by a latch only, the lock being entirely out of order, on the discovery of which Cap" Graham today ordered a new lock to be applyed—I have not yet examined the files, and records of the Office, and consequently cannot say anything more about their condition untill I overhaul them, a Service I presume easily performed as they do not appear volluminous—I am informed that the condition of the Seminole Indians is deplorable. A destructive drought which prevailed through out the Southern Section of our Country was fatal to the Crops of these Indians. They are roaming without the limits of their reserve in quest of Game & other Sustainance; and especially in pursuit of Ardent Spirit. Many individuals
(white men) like so many hungry Vultures hovering over the dieing Skeleton of some fallen Animal, have located little dirty Whiskey Shops around the Indian borders, who deaf to the cries of humanity contemning the laws. regardless of the principles of honor & common honesty, and, guided alone by avarice, sell spirit to the Indians, swindle them out of their horses, cattle, hoggs, corn & Peltry, and after thus depriveing them of the last means of subsistence, turn them a drift with appetites & feelings vitiated & inflamed by intemperance want & hunger, to prey upon their neighbours There is I am informed, a rum Distillery established on or near the line in a Section Sparsely populated by the whites, evidently with the diabolical view of selling the product to the Indians—I will do all in my power to suppress this disgracefull trafic; but the peculiar character of the country affords so many facilities to these unprincipled wretches in their illicit pursuit

will be in Tallahassee opportunely to urge it on the attention of the Council, as my instructions will carry me about the time of the meeting of that body, to that place Much has been said, of the unwillingness of the Indians to abide the arrangement made by them with the Board of Commissioners, relative to their removal beyond the Mississippi. I have determined to avail myself of the opportunity of accompanying Cap" Graham who in a fiew days will visit some of his command now building a Bridge across a stream on the road from Camp King to Tampa; for the purpose of acquiring a more perfect knowledge of the condition and temper of the Indians, and in further complyance with the instruction of Gov" Duvall to impress them with the necessity of preparation for their removal.
It will afford me relief to know the views of the Government as to the time of the removal of the Indians, as I am desirous to have my family with me. If it is expected that they or a part of them will remain beyond the next year, I will move my family to the Agency.
May I cultivate the land appended to or connected with the Agency House? If I bring my family here, plant a crop and the Indians emigrate in toto during the ensuing year will I be protected in the right to complete & gather my crop?
When the Indians do remove I verry much desire the Superintendance of their emigration. And the priviledge to continue in the Office of Agent for them in their new abode, should the Agency be continued—If the Office should be discontinued, permit me to hope that you will be able, and disposed to give me some other employment-

<docbody>The members of the bar of the County of Jackson in the Territory of Florida, impressed with a high sense of the merit of the present Judge of the Western District, and of the claims to their Confidence by his able, impartial and faithful administration of the Laws, ask the attention of the Congress of the United States of America to the Salary of that Officer—They respectfully suggest, that it is inadequate to his worth, his services and the arduous labors he has to perform-

The present provision was an ample one, when the only Court in the District was held at Pensacola, but now in consequence of the increase of population, five other Courts have been added, requiring ten times the labor on the part of the Judge, and imposing on him the additional task of travelling during the year more than two thousand miles.
So fully aware was the Legislative Council of the Territory of the severe duty imposed upon the Judge of this District, that in 1832
they passed a resolution praying of Congress to create another District and appoint another Judge-

That the commerce of this port has increased, within the last two years, to an extent requiring a direct communication with Europe.

That the bar, at the present entrance to the bay," precludes vessels of that class employed in the European trade, from entering.
That at the east end of the island of S* George, there is a ship channel, with safe anchorage inside, practicable for vessels of the desired tonnage.
That vessels cannot, however, safely enter, without the aid of a light on the island, and buoys to mark the channel.
That independently of the commercial facilities which would arise from these works, they must prove important in a national point of view, opening a safe harbour for public vessels. Your Memorialists, therefore, respectfully and earnestly Solicit an appropriation of money for their accomplishment.

<docbody>To HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida, SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29" ult° respecting the return of the Seminole boys now at the Choctaw Academy in Kentucky."
You will have perceived by one of my letters to M'. Westcott,” that it was believed that two of those boys were sons of Chiefs, that one of them died with cholera during the last Summer, and that the other had been brought to this place by Col" R. M. Johnson, and would be sent home by the first good opportunity. That Blunt's Son could not be identified at the Academy and that it was feared he was among the victims of last Summer's epidemic.
I have examined the boy brought on by Col" R. M. Johnson and found him to be one of the sons of Mulatto King. He stated to me, that his brother Orsler died with cholera last Summer, and that another of the Seminole boys also died, who was an orphan named Aaron—That all the other Seminole boys are living, and that among them is Billy the son of Blunt. This boy, who says his name is Jack Vacca, and older than his brother Orsler, has been sent off by the Stage

this morning and will probably arrive at your house in about a fort night.
After examining him and getting his report of the boys at the Academy, if Blunt and the parents of any of the other boys wish to have them returned home, you will, after learning such fact from them, employ some suitable person to go to Kentucky for the purpose of conducting them home. You will determine the best route and mode of their return, studying economy as well as the comfort of the children—You will attend to this business without delay, and draw upon the Department for the necessary expenses—It is to be hoped, that as the boys are rapidly improving in their studies none will be recalled except Blunt's son, and the boy called Sampson from Davy's Town. It would seem to be doing great injury to the children to have them sent back with a half finished education. You will however consult the wishes of the parents, and leave Blunt and the others, who have agreed to emigrate, no pretext for further delay. In case all or a part of them should be recalled, you will use your best exertions to have their places supplied by other boys of the nation. As a fund has been appropriated for such an excellent purpose, it is altogether desirable that they should avail themselves of the benefits to be derived from it.
I will soon address you on other topics embraced in the late letter Of Mr Westcott.”—
Very respectfully &c., ELBERT HERRING.

<place-time>Key West FLORIDA 15 Dec 1833</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, I have done myself the honor of reporting my arrival in command here on the 26 of Nov: & I have the honor to recommend that this post be abandoned.
This is an Island, about six miles in length, and from one to one &
a half in breadth, containing a population not exceeding three hundred, every person included; amongst whom, there are not more than thirty men of business: there is neither commerce, nor wealth of sufficient consequence to warrant the very heavy expence attending the location of a garrison here: All are concerned in wrecking, and for the lawless character of the wreckers, I beg leave to refer you to the Merchants, and shippers, at New York, and other ports.
Perhaps you may think it is necessary to guard the custom house

here, but the little duties which are paid, are in bills on Charleston and other large cities, and I doubt if the customhouse recipts pay the actual expences of the establishment.
This place is important only as a marine station, as such it should be occupied, if occupied at all, and fortified.
I think the government have been greatly deceived or they would never have established a port here, A Mr Symington who is, or pretends to be, one of the proprietors of the island, and who is a resident in the vicinity of Washington, has made himself I understand peculiarly officious in relation to the establishment of this post. You will find his name together with that of the “collector of the customs”
who is another proprietor, on the deed for the land, for the Barracks, doubtless these persons would be glad to sell all their lots here at the same rate and retire to the north.
The climate is such, that possesions immediately become tainted, and should I be under the necessity of buying to-morrow, the merchants would raise their prices at least four times, which is another reason why they should wish a military station here.
I now come to the public buildings. I understand that thirty one thousand dollars, have already been expended, if so, the government never had its money more miserably and erroneously squandered, or expended, The first thing that presents itself in coming to the cantonment, from the village, is the men's sinks the next, the mule's yard, then four wretched buildings 20 feet by 30—the first being intended for a blacksmith's shop which may answer the purpose, the next for a commissary store, the third, for a hospital, which is in every manner and way defective, being too small & having no piazza, the sun shines completely through it, an officer who has any regard for his men, will never suffer them to be put there, the fourth is the guard house, prison, magazine, the beauty of this combination is, that if any prisoner is evilly disposed by being either drunk or crazy, he can destroy not only himself, but the whole cantonment, now comes a large fram building intended as officers quarters, with only a roof, & cornices, if the money which has been expended for the latter, had been employed in weatherboarding it, the frame might have escaped rotting from the effects of the weather.
There is another building which was occupied by the officer who established this post as his quarters, and I understand that it is intended in the plan for an hospital, it is built over the water, and the waves beating constantly against the floor, keep it wet, In this climate when diseases are violent, the remidies are equally powerful, and I
should think a damp floor would be a fine place, for a sick man to die.

on. In fact the house is so damp, that I have decline occupying it, as my own quarters, There is besides the buildings above enumerated a one story errection, which was intended for a kitchen & mess room for the men, It is now occupied as quarters but is entirely unfit for such, being exposed to the sun, without piazza &c, There is another small building, which was built for the married men, in which the Surgeon & myself are now quarter, It has no piazza and the same difficult as the others, You have in the above a true history of all the buildings here for the army, As there is no fresh water, except the rain, which gives but a partial supply, you have now, and will be obliged to keep a transport here as long as you have troops, fo the purpose of fetching water, and the Quartermaster General will inform you that the expense of this vessel is equal to that of a Company of Infy.
I have written this letter in great haste for this mail, as it leaves but once a month, in order that these facts may be promptly known to you, which I trust will be an apology for the style & manner in which this letter is written Should representations of a reverse character to what I have above written have been made to you, perhaps you may see proper to order an Inspector General here to test the realities I have the honor to be, Sir, With the greatest Respect Your Most Ob Set, TIMOTHY PAIGE 1* Lt. 4 Infy Commanding COL.

While this Province was under the Spanish Goverment all actual bona fide setlers were at liberty to cut timber upon the public lands for their own private use (but not for purposes of speculation or for exportation) & it is believed that the practice still prevails, although no particular instances have been pointed out to me and no complaints have been made to me on the subject by the agents whose especial duty it was to attend to the preservation of the public timber, nor have I reason to suppose that the evil of it be one is of any great magnitude, such as it is, however I have no doubt that the ordinary process of law will be sufficient to arrest it, whenever the Goverment shall consider it necessary to institute proceedings for that purpose, it will be found I presume that most of the persons who have located themselves on public lands in this District, have done so with the intention to purchase the land at the sales, & that if they fail in doing so, they will leave them on their being purchased by others.

<place-time>GENERAL LAND OFFICE 24* December 1833.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR By the Act of Congress approved on the 28" of June 1832
(Laws U.S. 1 Sess" 22" Cong. p 133) the President of the United States is authorized to cause certain lots in the Cities of S*Augustine and Pensacola, to be selected for public purposes, and it is made “the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to cause to be surveyed all the public and private lots and Commons in and about said Cities”"
As no selection could be made by the President until those Cities were surveyed, the Secretary of the Treasury on the 24" of November 1832,” requested that instructions might be given to the Surveyor General at Tallahassee for their Survey, which request was complied with on the 28" of the same month.” In these instructions no mention was made of the Compensation to be allowed for executing the work, and the Surveyor General in a letter of the 3" Ins"' in

reference to the Survey of S" Augustine, having expressed a desire to be informed “what probable amount per lot should be given as compensation for this troublesome and difficult service” the subject is now submitted for your consideration.
That the Survey will be attended with many difficulties is extremely probable, and that no competent Deputy would undertake it for the usual Mileage is apparent, but inasmuch as the precise extent and nature of those difficulties, or the time that may be required to make the Survey cannot be known to this Office, I am not prepared, at this time, to recommend any specifid allowance, but would respectfully suggest the propriety of directing the Surveyor General to proceed in having the work performed, with the understanding that the compensation will be a reasonable one, and that it will be fixed by the Department after the delays and difficulties incident thereto are fully known.”

<docbody>TO GENERAL CHARLES GRATIOT Chief Engineer U. S.
SIR: I have the honor to enclose herewith Two accounts current and one Voucher relating to disbursements on account of the Improvement of the Escambia River for the 4* Quarter 1833.
Although the Contractors have not completed the Improvement of Section No 1. it was deemed advisable to pay them a part of the amount of the work actualy performed on that Section. The amount paid is considerably below the value of the work performed.
The rise of the waters will probably compel the contractors to suspend their operations until the next Summer, with the exception of that portion of them which relate to the clearing of the Banks from trees and other obstacles.
Lieut Bowman was sent to inspect the River previously to the payment being made to Contractors and I now enclose his Report for your information. I would observe that the Contractors were much delayed in the commencement of their operations by reason of the difficulty of obtaining laborers.

I feel satisfied with the disposition evinced by the Contractors to perform their contract with as little delay as possible; should I however perceive any thing to the contrary I will immediately make other arrangements to secure the object contemplated by the appropriations.
I have the Honor to be, Sir, very Respectfully Yr &c &c W" H. CHASE Capt PENSACOLA Dec 28. 1833.

Alexander H. Bowman to William H. Chase PENSACOLA Decr. 16th 1833.
To CAPT. W. H. CHASE Corps of Engineers SIR. In compliance with the request of the contractors for the improvement of the Escambia River, I have examined Section No. 1–
which was represented ready for inspection—owing to a rise in the river, the contractors have not been able to finish to the required depth—nor will they, in all probability complete it, until the low water next Summer.
In the mean time, the navigation of that portion which whieh I have inspected, is perfect; the only obstructions being logs on the bottom, which are now four feet below the surface of the water.—
To enable the contractors to meet engagements with their labourers, without which, their operations must stop, I deemed it advisable to advance a portion, of the amt due for work done on Section No. 1–
retaining in my hands, sufficient to complete the improvements, should they abandon their contract. They are still progressing with their operations, removing projecting trees, and such logs as come within the prescribed distance of the surface at the present stage, which is about two feet above lowest water— It is their intention to pass again over the whole river, and to remove such logs as the present high water will not permit them to attempt.
I have the honor to be very Respectfully Your Obt. Servt.

SIR, Your letter of the 3" inst.” with the accompanying papers was duly received, and I immediately brought the subject of surveying the Towns of St. Augustine & Pensacola before the Secretary of the Treasury, and he has directed me to instruct you “to proceed in the surveys directed by the Act of 28* June 1832, with the understanding that a compensation proportioned to the labors and difficulties of the work, will be allowed when it is completed.” This allowance will be fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and to enable him to do it, you will, on the completion of the survey, furnish me with a detailed statement of the extent and nature of the work, the time it occupied, and the difficulties incident thereto, with such remarks as may be necessary to a full understanding of the case.
It would perhaps, be advisable for the Deputies employed in this work, to have some communication with the Corporate authorities of the City upon the subject, in order that there may be a perfect understanding with them as to the principles by which the survey is to be governed, and to avoid, as far as practicable, all needless interference with any measures they may have taken in relation thereto."

this estimate from a conviction of the great additional facility the improvements will afford to the transportation of the mail, independant of the great benifit that will result from it to the Counties of Washington, Jackson & Walton and to the City of Pensacola "

Inhabitants of Mosquito County to Delegate White MOSQUITO COUNTY E Florida 8" Nov 1833
D" SIR, We have the honor to address you on a subject of much importance to the inhabitants of our county & of general interest to the citizens of East Florida and particularly to those of St Augustine.
During the past Summer a balance of the appropriation made by

Congress for the making & repairing the road from Jacksonville to New Smyrna Mosquito C° via S*Augustine has been expended and the road as far as the balance extended put in good order.” The repairs however were comprised within twenty miles of S*Augustine North & South. We profess to know nothing of the present state of the road from the point North of S*Augustine to which the repairs reached—but from Pellicers bridge twenty miles south, the road is in a most wretched state; the bridges are all decayed & the most of them entirely destroyed. The bridges on the road south of the Tomoka river have never been entirely completed and within a fortnight past the bridge over Spruce Creek, about 40 yards wide, has been burned down by the Indians.
We beg leave therefore respectfully to request you to procure an appropriation to make thorough repairs of the road & bridges South of S" Augustine to New Smyrna, and while on this subject, would suggest, as the mail rout has been extended to the latter place, that the appropriation should embrace a sufficient amount to build a bridge over the Tomoka River. The amount required to effect the objects in a substantial manner will be about three thousand five hundred dollars, to four thousand dollars.
We have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your most obsts John Lee Williams W. H. Williams Benj N. Putnam David R. Dunham *

Report of Captain Daniel E. Burch to Delegate White
[November 24, 1832]
Report and Estimates of certain Roads in the Territory of Florida, made in conformity to a request of the Hon: Joseph M. White Member of Congress.
From Pensacola via the Head of Pensacola Bay to Chipola the

F L Q R J D A T E R P I TO R Y 937
route named in the request;—there are two routes for a Road; and these again may be opened in part, each, by two different routes, VIZ:-
First. From Pensacola to the Head of Pensacola Bay;—thence to Blackwater Bay crossing at the most suitable place for a ferry at, or near to, the Head of the Bay;-thence to the ferry at the Yellow Water River settlement;—thence to East River; –thence to Nichol’s ferry, (or other suitable place of crossing the river in that vicinity,)
on the Choctawhatchie River;—and thence to Chipola at the point on it most for the convenience of the inhabitants; which I presume would be Webbville.—This route would be about 190 miles in distance; would pass chiefly through Pine Barrens; would be but little obstructed by Creeks, Swamps, or low grounds; and would have the advantage of passing through a section of country having considerable settlements, and in which some sections is already partially opened and used by the inhabitants. The expense of opening a good country road made in the usual manner and permanent, may be estimated at $11400.—
This Road may be made, after crossing East River, to intersect the one leading from Deer point to Marianna, at Alaqua Court House.
The advantage of an upper road accommodating the inhabitants in that section would however be lost, and moreover the distance increased. The country on this route would be similar in character
& soil to the other; the entire distance about 215 miles; and the expense of opening it to the point of intersection at Alaqua—being about 125 miles;—may be estimated at $7500.—
Second.—Same route to Blackwater Bay;-thence to Yellow Water River, crossing it below the junction of East River; thence to Nichol's, or other ferry, on the Choctawhatchie River, as above;—and thence to the Chipola Settlements, as above.—The country on this route would be similar in character & soil to the first described;—the distance the same of about 190 miles; and the expense of opening it may be estimated at the same amount of $11400.—
This road in like manner after crossing the Yellow Water River may be made to intersect the Road from Deer Point to Mariana at Alaqua Court House; the face of the country the same as before described;—the entire distance about 200 miles; and the expense of opening it to the point of intersection at Alaqua, being the same distance of about 125 miles; may be estimated at $7,500.
Having been called upon for this Report & estimates it may not be irrelevant for me to offer my opinion, that of the foregoing Routes, the first described, (crossing the Choctawhatchie at Nichol's or other ferry) would give the most accommodation to the Public generally.
446774–59–60

While describing these Routes for a Road I will also mention one somewhat different to either of the others, that may be taken, viz:—
From Pensacola to Cotton's Ferry on the Conecuh River; thence by the nearest practicable route across the Creeks which fall into Blackwater Bay to the ferry at the settlements on Yellow Water River; and thence by either of the Routes first described to the Chipola Settlements. Neither the face of the country on this Route, nor the distance, would vary materially from the others; excepting that the Conecuh Swamp would require extensive Bridges & Causeways, and there would be more Bridging of Creeks; to meet which additional expense of $5000.—must be added to either of the foregoing Estimates.
Although I have not a particular & minute knowledge of all the parts of the Routes, before described; yet the country generally, &
by far the greater portion of all the identical Routes described, are familiarly known to me; and I am therefore enabled to state, with a degree of confidence, that the foregoing report contains a sufficiently accurate estimate both of distances, & estimated expense of opening the Roads, to form the Basis of an appropriation, for whichever may be selected as the most eligible.

<place-time>INDIAN KEY, Flor. Jan. 6, 1834.</place-time>
SIR. Some time since I addressed to your care a petition to Congress for having this port made a Port of Entry & a Custom House established here." Expecting that an Agent would have been sent from this place who would be able to answer all inquiries in relation to the matters named in the petition, I did not enter into minute details. As I yet hope that an Agent will be in attendance at Washington, I deem the following items all that are necessary, at least for the present.
The whole number of Wrecking Vessels now on the Florida Reef is fourteen. Of this number one only cruises to leward (westward) of Bay Honda Harbour The remaining thirteen cruise to windward
(eastward) of Bayo Honda, & all of these vessels rendezvous at Indian Key. Eight of them are owned here—(One vessel, a fine schooner of sixty tons, has been added since the date of our petition.)
Of the whole number employed, only one is owned at Key West.

The following statement, obtained from the Inspector, exhibits the arrivals at & departures from this port for the three last quarters of
1833–
Arrivals, 142
2nd. Quar------------------ #. 135
Arrivals, 133 3rd. Q'r-------------------- £ 128 y Ar’s, 148 4th. Q'r-------------------- #: 145 By reason of the absence of the Inspector during a part of the quarter ending 31st. March, he is not able to furnish a statement for that quarter. We may fairly presume that the arrivals & departures for the 1st. Q'r. will average with the 2nd. & 4th. This will give Arriv's, 145 Dep's, 140 Arriv's, 568 Total for the year--------- #. 548 Were this made a Port of Entry & a Custom House & Court established here, the arrivals & departures would at once be more than double what they now are; & more than three-fourths, probably seven-eighths of the Custom House & Court business now done in the District would to the great convenience & advantage of all parties be transacted here."

in which you state, in relation to the suits instituted in your district

Against the U.

& particularly to ascertain the character of the witnesses who may be called to testify—That the object of this testimony is to strengthen claims to land founded on documents purporting to be copies of grants made & certified by the Secretary of the late Governor of this Province the originals of which, are not now, & have not been in the Archives here since the transfer of the Florida's to the United States—And you enquire whether any Steps are now being whether taken by the Government to ascertain whether these original documents really exist and to have them placed on file in the Archives here?
These letters were referred to the State Department but not being answered at the time, they have been permitted to lie over until now.
In a recent conversation with the Secretary of State on the subject were het returned te this Q#ee until new I am I was direeted by the F ef State he requested me to refer you to the late Message of the President to both Houses of Congress” for all the information possessed passed by the Department in relation to these Claims, and the steps taken to aseertain obtain these documents.”

And we your Humble petitioners do humbly pray, that your Honourable body, for the advantage of Commerce; safety of lives, and security of property, will in their wisdom, take into consideration the difficulties and dangers of such navigation, and make an appropriation, for a Light House to be built on Amelia Island, (“forming the South side of that entrance”) in place of the one now on Cumberland Island—which Light would be seen to a greater distance in all directions seaward, and give every advantage to the Mariner that they are intended, and facilitate the commerce of this section—And we likewise beg leave to represent to your Honourable Body that the officers appointed by government, that did survey this Coast—together with the officers of government vessels who have visited this Harbour, have, and do still concur, with your petitioners in the uselessness of the present Light on Cumberland Island, and the benefit to be derived from one if established on Amelia Island”—

SIR, I am informed by my predecessor in Office, and by the Counsel specially employed on the part of the Government, that several cases are now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States, between individuals claiming lands in Florida and Missouri, and the United States, and that the decision of some of these cases which have been argued, and the argument of those not yet actually heard, have from time to time, been deferred by the Court, for the purpose of enabling the Government to obtain from the Spanish authorities, certain archives relating to land titles in Florida and Louisiana which it was supposed were material to the proper disposition of the claims in question.—By a communication received by Mr. Taney from the State department, under date of the 12th of February 1833,” it appears that a dispatch was received at that department, from our Minister in Spain, on the 23d of April 1832, covering a royal order to the Governor of the Havana for the delivery of the archives referred to; that a special agent had been sent to the Havana with instructions to urge a compliance with that order; that the agent had not, in January 1833, obtained a final answer to his application; but that there was every reason to believe, that the papers would be received at the State Department, before the then next term of the Supreme Court.—Upon the statements contained in this communication, the Court postponed, until the present term, the decision and argument

of the cases referred to.—Under these circumstances, I beg leave to enquire, whether the archivies] applied for, or any of them, have been received at the State Department, or by its Agent at Havana;
and if not, whether there is good reason to believe, that any documents, material to the just decision of the Florida and Missouri land claims now pending before the Supreme Court, will at the present or any subsequent term of the Court, be obtained by the Government *—

And Whereas also, the reconstruction and extension of the Sea Wall in front of the City of St Augustine from Fort St: Marks to, St: Francis Barracks, are indispensable to the safety and protection of the City from severe Storms to which it is sometimes exposed, and from the constant inroads of the Sea"—
And Whereas the appropriation already made by Congress to effect these objects, will prove, it is believed, in sufficient for the purpose—
Therefore be it resolved, by this Legislative Council, That our delegate in Congress be requested to use his best exertions to obtain additional and sufficient appropriations for the entire accomplishment of the above works—
Resolved further that the foregoing Preamble and these Resolutions together with the special message of the Governor of this Territory, relating to the same subjects be duly certified by the President and Clerk of this House and forwarded to the said Delegate—

have made no contract with him supposing this was done before I left Kentucky—and as he must be paid for returning it will save expence to place the boys under his charge—Three of the boys who were at the Academy will return, Their parents consented and the little fellows are much delighted—Blount and Davy the Chiefs who are to leave the United States, now profess to be willing to go as soon as they receive that portion of the annuity due to them under the 4"
Article of the treaty of 1832,” This should be remitted immediately and the amount due to these chiefs you will see stated, in the General statement respecting Indian Towns on the Appalachicola river taken from the pay rolls of 1833 by M Wescott and by him transmitted some time since to the Department According to M'. Wescotts estimate, if Yellow Hairs party is included the amount should be $470
per annum for the remaing years under the Treaty of Camp Moultrie—If Yellow Hairs party is excluded then, Blount and Davy will be intitled to $390 per annum, It is all important that the Executive shall receive an early answer to the letters transmitted by Mr Wescott on this subject made at the time of the transmission of the statement above refered to—The Department should also decide as to the manner of paying the amount, and all money to be disbursed here, should be in checks on some Bank in New Orleans, as I must decline the responsibility of drawing for funds & coincide with Mr. Wescott in

the views he has given to the Department nor do I know in what other manner the treaty can be carried into effect to the satisfaction of the Government, and with justice to the Indians. Delay in making the final arrangements with Blount & Davy, should be avoided—as they say they are now ready and only wait for me to close the treaty—

<place-time>DEPARTMENT OF STATE Washington 24 Jany 1834.</place-time>
<docbody>BENJAMIN F. BUTLER Esquire Attorney General &c.
SIR, In reply to your Note of the 14" instant,” I have the honor to inform you that none of the papers concerning which you make enquiry, have been received at this Department; nor is it in my power to say that any of them will be, during the present term of the Supreme Court. It was mentioned by Mr. Livingston, the late Secretary of State in his Note to which you allude, addressed on the
12th February 1833, to Mr. Taney then Attorney General,” that, according to the last letters received at the Department, from the Consul and Agent of the U. States at Havana, application had been made for the delivery of the Archives, agreeably to the royal order, obtained for that purpose, but that the Captain General was deferring his decision until he should receive the report of Mr. Callava, former Governor of Florida. I now state that the Captain General, on the
8th March, communicated to the Consul his intention of carrying the royal order into effect, and informed him that directions had been

given accordingly at the Intendancy. Within less than a week from that time, the examination of the documents was commenced by the agent of the U. States, in company with the Spanish officers, whose duty it was to attend; and has been continued to the date of his last letters, with such necessary interruptions and delays as have arisen from the procrastinating and evasive disposition of the Colonial Authorities, the conflicting official duties of the Commissioners whose presence was required at the examination; the frequent holidays, during which the public offices are closed; the repeated illness of the Agent, and the dreadful prevalence of the cholera in the city, which, for a time, nearly put a stop to all business. Mr. Shaler, the American Consul, and Commissioner for the recovery of these archives died of the epidemic on the 28th of March subsequently to which the powers wherewith he had been vested were committed to Mr. Robinson, the Special Agent and Mr. Cleveland, the American Vice Consul.—
The principal duty has been performed by Mr. Robinson, who was represented by Mr. Shaler, in his letter to the Department, of the
10th February last, as “an intelligent, indefatigable and anxious public Agent,” and whose plan of investigation is spoken of in the highest terms by Judge Webb of Florida, after personal observation.
Some idea of the arduous task he has had to perform may be gathered from the following Extract of a letter written by him to the Department on the 4th of May last,” and which relates to one only of several places, in which the Archives sought for, have been deposited.—
“On opening the first apartment, by the side of a stairway, fourteen large boxes full of papers, reputed to be the old Archives of the Floridas and Louisiana, were exhibited—Near them the contents of four other boxes of similar documents were promiscuously piled together.—
Passing up stairs, I was ushered into a room of twenty five by seventy feet, with forty seven cases, or presses of papers, extending from top to bottom, ranged around on every side, all filled with Archives of different places; one third of which were designated or pointed out, as Louisiana and Florida documents. Besides these piles of books and bundles of papers of a like character were indiscriminately placed, sufficiently numerous to fill several other cases, making together, at least, twenty tons of documents, the whole without methodical order, indexes, or inventories.”—Out of these papers, Mr Robinson is required, first to select those, which he claims as belonging to the U. States; of which descriptive lists are to be made by the Spanish Commissioners, and submitted to the proper authority, who will then decide, which are to be copied, which surrendered and which reserved.—The Commissioners having declined to furnish the lists

alluded to, until the selection is completed, that process must necessarily be gone through before a demand of any portion of the documents can be made with effect. It is proper to state that although the Louisiana Archives, to which the United States are as justly entitled, as to those of Florida, are not embraced in the terms of the royal order, they have nevertheless, been put aside by the Agent, without opposition, and instructions have been sent to our Minister, at Madrid, to apply to the Spanish Government for such an extension of the Order, as will ensure their delivery. The latest accounts from Mr. Robinson, are to the 23d of December last, by which, it would appear, that a further period of six Months will, probably, be required for the completion of the business entrusted to him, but not longer, unless some accident should intervene to produce extraordinary delay, within which time, it is hoped, that an answer to the application above mentioned, may be received from the Court of Spain, and transmitted to the Captain General of Cuba for execution.—
It is impossible, from, the information received at this Department, to pronounce positively upon the materiality of the papers, in question, to the decision of the causes now pending before the Supreme Court, but it appears to be the firm impression of the Agent of the Government, to whom the selection is committed that they are essential to an enlightened determination of the controversies alluded to, and his general representations of their character are certainly calculated to induce a concurrence in his opinion.—Among those which have come under his observation, he enumerates royal orders and instructions to the Governors of Cuba, Florida and Louisiana in relation to sales and donations of land; decrees of the Governors, and various legal proceedings touching the same subject; documents explanatory of the powers of the Colonial officers; regulations respecting the rights and privileges of the Indians, and the trade and intercourse to be carried on with them; Maps and Surveys; Notes of titles and books of entry and record.—Some of these papers are said by Mr. Robinson to relate directly to Panton Leslie & Co. and to John Forbes & Co., whose alleged grant from the Indians, is questioned by the former Surveyor General of Louisiana and Florida,” in a report made by him to the Spanish Government in the year 1822 comprising the transactions of several years, previous to the cession of those provinces to the United States.”—
I take this opportunity of mentioning that the decree of Cienfuegos, formerly Captain General of Cuba, authorising the Governor of Florida to permit the alienation of certain lands by John Forbes & Co., to

Colin Mitchell, for which the agent of the United States at Havana was instructed to search, has not been found; nor has any evidence or trace of its existence been discovered, during a diligent examination for three months in the various bureaux of the Colonial Government.”—

I have answered M. Douglas that it was the duty of some person to have these confirmed claims reported to the Keeper of Archives, to enable him, to report them, (as required by law) to this Office for its government, and also to enable that Officer, to grant his certificate to the claimant, as the official authority for my Deputies to survey them as required by the Commissioners instructions to me and my instructions to the Deputies.
Have a special care of all certificates, as they may be required at your hands; and I need not repeat, the so often told tale, of giving every facility in your power, to the interests due the claimants, while you retain & special, and punctilious regard to your instructions, and to the interests of the government I hope a reciprocal feeling will be manifested towards you by the inhabitants and that all well go forward smoothly.
I remain very respectfully Your Obd" Ser"

SIR I beg permission to call your attention to the apportionment and representation of Florida, in our Legislative Council—This Territory has been for several years governed by a minority in its Legislature—East and West Florida are not equal to the Middle district in population and yet they elect Twelve members of eighteen, which is the whole number of the Legislative Council—The Governor, in the first instance made the apportionment, to the satisfaction of all the districts—since that time the emigration has been greatly in favour of the Middle district By refference to the last census you will see in the year 1830 the Middle district was nearly equal in population to all the residue of Florida, and since that period it has become still greater The Legislative council, have refused to make a new apportionment, as directed by the act of Congress, and as the majority is from the East & West we can never get a fair and just apportionment through our Legislature—as both East & West, Florida must looss a part of their present members *
I trust sir the gentlemen of your committee will lay before the house a bill," making a new apportionment in this Territory according to the White population of the several districts as returned by the last CenSUS
I am Respectfully Your obt sert Wm P. DUVAL
on former occasions, to obviate the difficulty arrising from our unequal representation, additional members have been given to the Legislative council, but, this expedient did not answer the object

The distance by the old Road was Sixty Two & a half Miles, but by the new, has been reduced to Fifty being a saving weekly of Fifty Miles in the transportation of the mail In Completing the work, besides his own Labor and attention, your petitioner Actually expended the large Sum of Sixteen hundred and Forty Dollars. A Cause way of Two Miles was made and Bridges one of One hundred & Thirty One of One hundred and One of Sixty Yards, the work is complete, in good order a ferry established at the River Perdido, and the Mail Stage now running on that route, your petitioner asks nothing for his persehal personal Gempensatien service but most respectfully prays your Honorable body that he may be repaid the Sum of money necessarily, and actually paid out in the Completion of the road and your petitioner will every pray HENRY ANUNES

The Road is in very good condition, and affords additional facilities for the transportation of the mail, between Mobile & Pensacola. There is a saving of distance of about 12 miles. Mr Nunes has undoubtedly been at considerable expence in opening the Road; and I should consider his estimate of expenditures upon the same as not extravagant. The Road also passes for the greater part of the distance through the public lands.
For the above reasons I would recommend that Mr Nunes be reimbursed the monies expended by him.

<docbody>HON” JAMES K. POLK. Ch" of the Committee of Ways & Means.
H. R.
SIR:—I beg leave respectfully to invite your attention to what appears to be an omission in the appropriation law of the last session.
The Act of the 23" of May 1828," authorized persons claiming title to lands, in the Territory of Florida, to institute proceedings against

the U. States before the Judge of the Superior Court, of the District in which the land was situated in order to try their title, and gave the Judges in each of the Districts, an additional compensation of eight hundred dollars over and above the regular salary, on account of the new duty thus imposed on them—The appropriation act of March 2nd 1833," provides this additional compensation, “for two of the Judges” without designating which two were to receive it.—
and there being four Districts in Florida, this Department did not feel itself authorized to decide between them, and give the additional salary to any two of them to the exclusion of the others. If it was the intention of Congress, to exclude two of the Judges from the additional compensation it is necessary that a law should pass designating the two to whom it is to be paid—and if the additional compensation was intended to be given to the four, it is then necessary that a further appropriation should be made to cover the omission.
I transmit herewith the copy of a letter from Richd K. Call," Esquire, the assistant counsel of the U. States in the Territory of Florida,—
and also the copy of a letter from Thomas Douglass Esquire," the District Attorney of the U. States for the Eastern District, stating the number of suits against the U. States, in the different courts of the Territory. It appears from these letters that in the Western and Middle District, the law giving jurisdiction to the courts, in these cases, imposed scarcely any additional trouble on the Judges, and there was no sufficient reason for allowing to them the additional sum of $800.—The Southern District has now but very few cases—and the mass of the business appears to have been in the Eastern District where ninety-nine cases were depending against the U. States in June last.”
Under these circumstances I presume that the appropriation law of last session was intended to provide the additional compensation for the Judges of the Southern and Eastern Districts.” But the state of the business can hardly justify the continuance of the additional compensation to the former for the present year.
I therefore respectfully recommend that in order to remove the uncertainty in the appropriation before made, an appropriation of sixteen hundred dollars be now made for the payment of the additional compensation of eight hundred dollars each to the Judges of the Superior Courts of the Southern and Eastern Districts of the Territory of Florida, for the year 1833, and that an appropriation

of eight hundred dollars be made for the payment of the additional compensation to the Judge of the Superior Court of the Eastern District of the Territory of Florida, for the year 1834.”—
I have the honor to be Very Respectfully, Sir, Yr. Obt Servt.

ELBERT HERRING Esq. Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
SIR, I have the honor herewith to transmit to you a Copy of a letter from Gen' Wiley Thompson, Agent of the Florida Indians, to me dated the 31* ultimo, And a copy of my answer to the same bearing date the 2" Inst.” These letters relate, as you will see, to the situation of those Indians who are now ready to leave the United States. If I had drawn on the Department for the amount required to pay that part of the annuity, which the chiefs Blount and Davy are entitled to receive under the treaty of 1832,” it would have been an unauthorized act on my part—No draft, however, could, at this time, be cashed here or short of Mobile or New-Orleans for hard Dollars, which is the only Money these Indians will receive, as they are to leave the United States.
Under the circumstances detailed in Gen.' Thompson's letter, I
directed him to supply rations to Blount's and Davy's bands, should they be detained for the funds they expect from the Government, and trust the Department will approve the course I have directed the Agent to pursue.
It is important that I should early receive specific instructions in relation to the execution of the late Treaties with the Several Indian tribes—If any large number are to emigrate during the present year, it is time to prepare for their removal.
The reports of the Indian Agent, and my several communications on this Subject, have no doubt been received by you, and from a full knowledge of the causes operating on the minds of the Indians, as well as of their temper and feelings, leave no doubt, that with all the active aid of the Department, it will be no easy task to consummate the wishes of the Government—The Agent and Sub Agent are desirous of learning what compensation they may expect for extra

<place-time>[February 6, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States:
The Memorial of the Trustees of the Pensacola Academy most respectfully represents:
That deeply impressed with the importance of Education to the rising generation: your Memorialists are endeavouring to give efficacy to the Act of the Legislative Council of Florida under which they were appointed,” by establishing a Seminary adequate to the Literary wants of this Community: In their exertions they meet with many obstacles from the want of Funds to enable them to erect the Building necessary for an Academy. From the School Lands heretofore set apart by your Honourable Body for the Support of Common Schools"
the Institution under the charge of your Memorialists, has never received the least benefit. Those lands have never been rented or leased out within the Knowledge of your Memorialists, and if they have No Funds arising therefrom have ever been paid into the hands of your Memorialists, or their Predecessors in Office.
With the Confidence of Children towards a Kind Parent, your Memorialists look to their Government, with the earnest hope and Confident expectation, that out of the Abundant Means within the Power of that Government, something will be extended towards furthering the object which we have in view; Your Memorialists are perfectly Confident that Congress is fully aware of the benefits of encouraging Education—that to make good Citizens, their minds must be enlightend—that to perpetuate Liberty and our blessed form of Government its Citizens must be enlightend enough to appreciate those blessings, Congress has hitherto been a liberal Patron to the Cause of Education; Your Memorialists will not doubt, but that the same, wise, generous and patriotic feelings will continue to influence your Honourable Body In looking around for a Source for Funds sufficient to enable your Memorialists to build an Academy adequate to the wants of Pensacola, the attention of your Memorialists have been drawn to certain Lots within the City of Pensacola belonging to the Government of the United States, these Lots are known upon the Plan of said City

<docbody>SIR:—For several years when the duties of the Governor and Secretary of this Territory were not as onerous as at present, a law authorised the employment of a Clerk for said offices, but in '29 from

motives of economy the law was repealed," and since that period, these officers have been obliged to compensate any persons they have employed out of their private funds, except then small allowances have been made for special services by the general government. At present the offices of the Executive, Secretary, Treasurer, and Auditor are not occupied except during office hours on the day, and at night they are exposed to the depredations of any incendiary or mischevious person. Valuable documents and papers and in fact the original laws and journals are liable to be abstracted or destroyed by those who may be interested in their absence or destruction. The Executive deemd it his duty to bring this subject to the attention of the Council.—In the present insecure condition of the Capitol, the responsibility of the safe preservation of the public records should be imposed upon the public officers. The accumulation of business renders the employment of a Clerk necessary, and the security of the records requires that some one should occupy the offices during the night.—Without a law however, the Executive has no authority to employ such person.—I am Sir, Respectfully, your ob't. Ser'vt."

<place-time>[February 11, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>The committee on the Territories to whom was refered the memorial of James M. Garnett, Muscoe Garnett and Maria H Garnett of Essex County Virginia Report.
The Memorialists allege that they are the owners of a number of slaves removed several years ago from Virginia to the Territory of Florida; that the Legislature of said Territory has imposed a tax of ten dollars a head on all the slaves of non residents which shall be hired out without reference to the amount for which said slaves may have been hired;" that an ex post facto operation was given to this enactment by applying it to slaves hired out several weeks before the passage of the law, and that the same or perhaps another law subjects

any non-residents slaves that may be sold in the Territory to a further tax of fifteen dollars each—They therefore ask Congress for relief-
The Committee are satisfied that the memorialists are entitled to relief—It is certainly against the policy of the United States as well as the dictates of common justice to allow any Territorial Legislature to tax the property of non residents higher than the same property of resident citizens—
“The provisionary authority appointed under the act of 22"
February 1819," having passed an ordinance providing for the naturalization of the Inhabitants of Florida,” and the City Council of St Augustine having imposed by ordinance certain taxes upon the inhabitants, an act of Congress was passed on the 7" May 1822"
repealing both ordinances and making the execution penal’’-(see
7th vol. Laws U.S. page 69. Chap 86)—
The committee think Congress should always protect the property of the citizens of the United States when subjected to the operation of unjust legislation by the Territorial governments—In the case above refered to that principle of protection is asserted and maintained in practice—The same principle requires the same practice now and for that purpose the committee herewith report a Bill-

To HIS EXCELLENCY, WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Tallahassee, Florida, SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 23" ulto,"
and to submit it for the consideration of the Secretary of War." He has decided, that the proportion of the annuity of Five thousand dollars, due to Blunt & Davy's band, under the 4" article of the treaty of 1832," cannot be remitted, until an appropriation is made by

Congress.” The mode of division, proposed by Mr Westcott, is approved, and the annuity will be paid in the proportions, indicated by him. You are requested to represent to Blunt and Davy, that this delay in the payment of the annuity cannot be admitted as a valid reason for their delaying to emigrate. They will receive their money as promptly at their new residence, as they would, if they remained where they now are.”
I presume M” Henderson will transmit an account for the expenses of the boys returned from, and of those sent to the Choctaw Academy.”
It speaks well for that institution, that both parents and Children have manifested so strong a desire to enjoy, for a longer time, its advantages.—

<source>[NA:SF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.: DS*]</source>
<place-time>[February 12, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United.
States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Legislative Council of Florida, respectfully sheweth, That by reason of the recent settlement, of this Territory, and the sparseness of its population, and other disadvantages incident to a new country, the people of this Territory are unable to undertake, without aid from your honourable body, the many important public improvements so necessary to their wellfare, and of which Florida is more eminently susceptible, with [more]” certain prospect of advantage, than any other portion of the Union.
The people of Florida, whom your Memorialists represent, and in whose behalf they now address the National Legislature, conceive they have a just right to ask at the hands of Congress such assistance.
An appeal to the United States as our parent government; for necessary support and help, will not, we are persuaded, be totally unheard and disregarded. A large portion of the lands in Florida are suitable, and its climate (as has been proved by the unerring test of experience favourable to the profitable cultivation of the sugar cane and the

manufacture of sugar. Many of our enterprising planters, notwithstanding they commenced the experiment under the most serious disadvantages, comparatively unacquainted with the mode of cultivating the plant and manufacture of the article, have so succeeded in both, as to excite the most sanguine and flattering anticipations of the future prosperity and wealth of Florida. The time. it is believed.
is not far distant when. if the sugar planters of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia. are afforded but a little of that countenance and aid from the National Government, which has been so liberally extended to other interests, they will be enabled to furnish a sufficiency of sugar for the consumption of our whole country, and that at a cost reduced from that of the present importation.
The probability and even possibility of such a result affords a cogent appeal, not only to the patriotism but to the interests of our common country. The accomplishment of this object, is of such paramount importance, as to justify under different circumstances of prosperity and when our condition as a nation should be less flourishing than at present the extension by the National Legislature of the most liberal aid towards it. But at a time when the coffers of our national Treasury are overflowing when the chief contention among our statesmen seems to be as to the disposition of the surplus there should be no hesitancy in contributing a small portion of the common fund to be thus applied to the aid and on account of the general interests. the National Government are yet the proprietors of nineteen-twentieths of all the lands in Florida. Apart from the duty of protection devolving on the United States, and laying aside the considerations of justice and patriotism it is respectfully submitted that the citizens of Florida, the proprietors of the remaining twentieth have a well grounded right to claim of the General Government a fair and pro rata contribution towards the cost of all works conducive to the improvement and calculated to advance the value of its domain: The propriety and force of this argument must be admitted by every just and unprejudiced mind. In no other section of the Union where the aid sought could be rendered without encountering constitutional objections from many enlightened statesmen does the same obvious and imposing necessity exist for the assistance of Congress, in bringing into beneficial action the resourses of the country as in Florida. Except at two or three points Our Territory has been inhabited principally by the red sons of the forrest, till since its purchase by this Government by Spain but little inducement existed, had opportunity and means been afforded the former white population of Florida to remove the obstructions which impede the safe and easy navigation of most of our rivers. Different circumstances enabled and induced the first settlers in Louisiana and other

parts of the Union to construct many of the most necessary of their artificial works, to give life and vigour to the superior natural advantages of the country. hence it is those sections are a quarter of a century in advance of Florida in agricultural improvement: The accumulated labours of the two last generations are now upon our hands. What the first settlers of other parts of the Union performed for the population that has succeeded them it devolves upon us to do for ourselves and the future citizens of Florida. The aid rendered by the French government at the early settlement of Louisiana in the construction of the levees on the Mississippi, and the general improvement of the country, was of the most liberal character, and is yet beneficially felt by the inhabitants. To that aid is attributable in no small degree the rapid but permanent advancement and steadily increasing prosperity and wealth of that State. With similar assistance from the National Government the labours of the citizens of Florida will produce equal, if not more beneficial results. Without such assistance, all expectation of the construction of any but a few of the least expensive and most unimportant improvements for the causes stated must be abandoned: A quarter of a century at least must elapse before we shall have the wealth and strength to undertake the principal works unaided and alone. This Legislative Council indulge the hope that the enlightened representatives of a great enterprising and free people in the full tide of prosperity will not defer to a future generation the glory of thus laying the foundation of an enduring testimonial of their forecast and wise liberality. They trust that the enjoyment of the invaluable benefits in certain prospect to ourselves and those who come after us, resulting from such improvements may not be postponed as in the period of infancy we most feel the necessity of such aid. The particular object of this memorial is, however, to ask from the general Congress an appropriation of nine thousand dollars to be expended in clearing out the river Chipola in West Florida, from its mouth to the natural bridge on said river contiguous to the town of Marianna.
This river with the appropriation above increased by the gratuitous aid of the citizens residing near it can be made navigable for large keel boats to the point beforementioned. The character of the obstructions to be removed and an estimate of the costs upon which the foregoing statement is predicated is to be found in a communication from an efficient and intelligent engineer in the service of the United States, A copy of which is hereunto annexed;” and which together with a petition asking said appropriation signed by a numerous and respectable portion of the people of West Florida has

been heretofore forwarded to our Delegate in Congress. To the document hereunto appended, your memorialists refer as showing the importance and beneficial character of the work contemplated. Your memorialists would, however in addition mention one or two facts, not specially noticed in said communication and which it is respectfully submitted, should be entitled to the peculiar attention of Congress. Experience has proved that if sugar is transported whenever any considerable distance by land and in ordinary waggons the costs thereof is not only greatly increased but the article itself depreciates in quality. Owing to this circumstance and the obstructions beforementioned existing to the safe navigation of most of our streams a considerable portion of the best sugar lands in Florida have not been appropriated to the culture of the cane. It is as yet only in the immediate vicinity of the principal waters that our sugar planters have ventured to establish themselves.
This difficulty exists as to the cultivation of but few other products and an important argument is thereby afforded in favour of improvements in Florida not applicable to sections where the sugar cane cannot be cultivated. At the head of the Chipola river is a large body of rich land equal in fertility and as eminantly and peculiarly adapted to the culture of the cane as perhaps any to be found on our Southern coast. A considerable portion of these lands are now the property of Government but the contemplated improvement of the Chipola would no doube enhance the value and occasion their speedy sale. Wherefore your memorialists in behalf of the people of Florida generally, and specially, in aid, of those who reside near the Chipola, ask from your honourable bodies the appropriation aforesaid.
Resolved, That the above memorial be signed by the President and certified by the Chief Clerk of this House; and that the same together with the accompanying document be forthwith forwarded to our Delegate” in Congress.”

<source>[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]</source>
<place-time>[February 13, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>Whereas, the late ill advised arrangement as to the transportation of the mails between St. Augustine and Tallahassee, which it is understood, was made by an agent of the General Post office, possessing little knowledge of the country, is presented by the Grand Jury of the counties of Alachua, Columbia and Hillsborough as a grievance to the inhabitants of those counties, and as detrimental to the interests of a growing and flourishing portion of our Territory, -as in fact, virtually excluding them from the benefits of the Post Office Establishment—depriving them of the facilities of communication, and closing against them the avenues of intelligence, by the wisdom of our Government generally open and free to the people of the United States.
A great privation to the inhabitants of these counties—without even the inducement of a pecuniary saving thereby to the Post Office Department.
And whereas, also, From the presentments of the same Grand Jury, the importance and great value of a public road from Newnansville to St. Augustine, by the way of Spring Grove, Micanope and Palatka are most manifest, as a sure means of advancing not only private property, and prosperity, but also the interests of the middle States, in quickening the sale, and enhancing the prices of the public lands, so fertile and extensive in that section of our Territory.

Therefore, be it resolved by the Legislative Council of Florida, That our Delegate in Congress be requested to urge upon the Department of the General Post Office, the necessity and justice of speedily correcting the dis-arrangement of the mails above complained of.—And that he also be requested to obtain from Congress, if practicable, a sufficient appropriation for the repair and opening of the above designated road from Newnansville to the city of St. Augustine.”
Be it further Resolved, That the foregoing preamble & resolution, together with so much of the presentments of the Grand Jury of the aforesaid counties, as has relation to the subject matter hereof, duly certified by the President and Clerk of this Council, be transmitted to the Delegate in Congress.
Which were read, the rule being waived—were put on their passage and adopted.

<dochead>REPORT OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON STATE OF THE TERRITORY</dochead>
<source>[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]</source>
<place-time>[February 13, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>Mr. Ward from the committee on the State of the Territory, to whom was referred an enquiry, as to the propriety of submitting to the people of Florida, the question of state government, made the following report:
The committee on the state of the Territory in conformity with a resolution adopted on the 23d ultimo, having had under consideration the matters therein contained, have the honor to REPORT:
That they consider the subject of the adoption of a State Government as of primary importance, as involving deeply the interests of the Territory, and as proper at this time, to be submitted to the serious consideration of the people of Florida. That while on the one hand, it would be unwise and imprudent, rashly and without resources, to precipitate an event of this character; we shall on the other, be not less culpably wanting to ourselves, if we remain insensible to the disadvantages of our present state of provincial vassalage.

The responsibility of the individuals imbued with the power of enacting and administering the laws to those whose interests are affected by their operation, is a principle upon which is based the whole system of republican institutions. and however much the General Government may be actuated by a desire to promote the views and foster the interests can be as well understood as by the people themselves; or if understood, that they will meet with due consideration, amid the pressure of the many important and conflicting interests which occupy the attention of Congress and the Federal Executive. We are placed at an immense distance from the centre of our Governmental system. We are liable to have sent among us by appointment of the Government, officers unacquainted with the policy and interests of the Territory, destitute of those claims upon the confidence of the the people, which are acquired by residence, intercourse, and community of sentiment; and above all, irresponsible to those who are to be vitally affected by their official acts. Nor is this irresponsibility confined to themselves alone—It extends itself to those officers, of which the creation has been imparted to the people. It is easy for the Legislature to attribute to the Executive, Judicial, or ministerial Government officer, the faults of improvident or corrupt Legislation; and it is as easy for the other to disguise or avoid the responsibility of malfeasance or neglect of duty, by the real or imputed derelictions of those holding office from the people.
Another baneful effect of the present system of appointments, is felt in the enervating influence upon the characters and energies of a country having no rewards to hold out to tried and faithful public services. So much is this the case, that it is believed the policy of the Government has been to appoint to office, strangers to the Territory and its citizens, in preference to residents of equal talents and abilities; and who, added to these, those claims which are derived from a long intercourse with the people of the Territory, and character and integrity appreciated by them. In the absence of the high and animating inducements which are held out to talent, virtue and patriotism, in the grateful confidence of a free people, the population of our country is retarded, its energies repressed, and enterprise and public spirit paralyzed Another consideration connected with the moral and intellectual advancement of the country, strongly urges the adoption of a government of our own, as soon as it may be in our power. Throughout our widely extended Territory, the want of some system which will bring education within reach of the yeoman and mechanic, is already sensibly felt. With all the natural advantages which we possess, with a soil as fertile, and a climate as propitious as ours, and with a popula-
446774–59–62

tion, which for enterprise and intelligence, is without a parallel in a frontier country, we shall still fall short of the destiny which would seem to await us, if we fail to provide the means of education for the generation who are to succeed us. To effect this object, the care of the General Government has made an adequate provision in the sixteenth sections of land reserved for the use of Schools, and two townships to be devoted to the endowment of a University. But these means are withheld by the prudent policy of the Government until we become a State, in no point of view, perhaps, does the urgent expediency of the step now under consideration, present itself more strongly.
But the enquiry must first be made, are we competent to the effort?
What are our resources, when the support of the General Government shall have been withdrawn? Is our population such as to render a movement upon the subject feasible? or to give assurance of a capability on our part to sustain the increased expenditure?
By the 6th article of the Treaty of cession, it is guarantied that the inhabitants of the Territory of Florida shall be incorporated in the Union, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution.” It is believed, that there is nothing in that instrument prohibitory of the accomplishment of this guaranty. The
3d section of the 4th article of the Constitution, gives to Congress power to admit new States into the Union: And the 3d section of the first article, which established the ratio of representation, also provides that “Each State shall have at least one representative.”
Clearly recognizing the principle, that a State may exist or consequently be created, although not having the number of inhabitants, which constitutes the basis of the ratio. But even supposing that a different construction should be put upon the last cited section, still it is believed, that we may as matter of right demand admission. The population of Florida by the last Census, amounted to thirty-four thousand five hundred, and presuming upon a probable ratio of increase since that period, the Territory must now contain near fortyfive thousand inhabitants. When we take into consideration further, that the portion of the Territory hitherto occupied by the Seminole Indians is about to invite a numerous population, and that before another Census can be taken, or even the measures now considered of, carried into effect, the place of those savages will be doubly supplied from adjoining States. Your Committee feel themselves justified in the conclusion, that no obstacle on the score of population will oppose the proposed change in the form of our government.

Assuming then the fact, of our right to ask of the Congress of the United States, a fulfilment of the stipulation in the treaty of cession above referred to, let us inquire into the condition in which we shall be placed in respect of our internal resources.
There are annually expended by the United States, in the support of the Territorial Government, perhaps forty thousand dollars. Of this sum, however, by far the greater part consists of the salaries of officers which would still subsist after establishment of a State Government. The United States Courts would still be maintained.
The Custom Houses, Land Offices, &c. would still be continued We already pay the salaries of officers of the Territorial Treasury.
The only additional expenses, therefore, for which we should have to provide, would be the salaries of the two Executive officers, of a State Judiciary, and the expenses of the Legislative Department. Of these, taking the present salaries and pay under each of the two first heads, as a sufficiently liberal criterion, and allowing for the latter double the amount now appropriated by Government, the gross amount, it may be safely affirmed, will not exceed annually twenty thousand dollars. To this sum, add ten thousand dollars for contingencies and occasional appropriations, and it will appear that thirty thousand dollars will afford the requisite annual revenue. It remains now to inquire whether we may safely incur such annual expenditure, with an assurance of deriving the moneys to meet it, from any moderate system of taxation.
The amount of revenue payable annually into the Territorial Treasury, according to the assessments under our present system, is perhaps equal to between ten and twelve thousand dollars. But it is confidently believed, that under a more strict and vigilant care, it would amount to at least one-third more without any increase in the rate of taxes. If the Revenue bill now pending in the House, should pass into a law, it is probable that fifteen thousand will be annually raised, the taxes remaining at their present standard. Upon a comparison of our Revenue Laws with those of the States, it will be found that the Territorial taxes are not more than one-third in proportion to those which are levied in the States, and that in many instances, we fail to exact any tax from many species of property, which are there legitimate and lucrative sources of revenue. Our taxes upon land are almost nominal, and are so estimated, that the true taxable value of the land is not justly ascertained. The tax upon town property is notoriously so low, as to make it impossible to be collected, the amount due from a large portion of proprietors, not reaching to more than fractions of cents. Again, in many, if not all of the States, the list of taxable property is given in on the oath of the owner, and adequate pecuniary penalties imposed for fraudulent conceal-

ments of taxable property. The want of such provisions in our Revenue system, tends materially to diminish the Revenue.
From all this, it is believed, it may with safety be assumed, that without raising the rates of taxation above the standard common to most of the States, it is in our power to provide means for maintaining a State Government.
There is still another view of this subject, to which your committee will briefly allude. It is believed that the mere fact of being a Territory, has the effect to repress emigration.—The idea always prevails, that in a frontier territory, the laws are weak and inefficient, and the people semi-barbarous. Individuals possessed of wealth, are in many instances deterred from embarking their fortuns in a territory, having no settled form of Government, and whose future prosperity depends upon the problematical issue of becoming a State or not, and, in becoming a State, upon the character of the Constitution and Laws which she may adopt. This impediment removed, there can be no doubt that wealth, enterprise, intelligence and talent will flow into our country, increasing and placing beyond the possibility of doubt, its resources for a State revenue.
Entertaining these views, and believing it proper to elicit an expression of public opinion upon the subject, the committee have reported a Bill in conformity with the terms of the Resolution referred to them, and pray to be discharged from further consideration of the subject.
Respectfully submitted, GEO. T. WARD, Chairman.
Which was read and agreed to.

<dochead>REPORT OF A SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</dochead>
<source>[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]</source>
<place-time>[February 14, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>Mr. Blount from the select committe, to whom was referred a communication from his Excellency the Governor, made the following Report:
The Select Committee to whom was referred the Message of the Governor of the 25th of January, in relation to the Election of Chief Magistrate of this Territory by the people thereof, beg leave to REPORT:
That while they disclaim any intention of exception to the present incumbents of the offices of Governor and Secretary, as to the manner in which they have discharged their duties, or otherwise, they agree

F L Q RIDA 7" E. R. R. I TO R Y 973
with the Executive in opinion, that the election of those officers is properly a right belonging to the people. Howmuch soever, well satisfy the people of Florida have reason to be, with the officers selected by the National Government, the exercise of this right, is too valuable to be yielded without necessity. It is the foundation of every Republican Government. Deprived as we are, of all participation or influence in the choice of the Chief Officers of our Territory, denied also, a voice in the Election of our National rulers, we are rather the subjects of Colonial vassalage, than the citizens of a free republic,-Our present system of Government is totally inconsistent with the genius of free institutions. Why should we be denied a more equal participation of the blessings of free Government with our fellow citizens of the States? Are we alone incapable of self Government? That no people are! is the every day argument of despots, against liberal institutions, and may as well be urged against the National and State Governments of this Union, as against the people of Florida. We may be yet poor, and unable to support a State Government, and hence our application for admission into the Union should be deferred. But, does our want of wealth render us incapable of exercising our judgments in the selection of our officers?
The pages of History show, that it is when a people have become enervated by wealth and ease, and luxury, that they relax their vigilance, become careless, and exhibit apathy in the choice of their magistrates. A community in the vigor and strength of youth, although poor, is not prone to become inert or negligent on such subjects.
The aborigines of the country it is anticipated are soon to be removed west of the Mississippi, and no interests of the United States can exist, the protection of which will devolve upon the Executive of Florida. The public domain is under the control of other officers, and the other national concerns in Florida have each their distinct and independent guardian.
The committee, although it was not specially referred to them, have deemed it advisable to suggest as connected with this subject the propriety of an application to Congress for a Senate as it allowed in the Territories of Arkansas and Michigan.” On former occasions, the arguments in favor of allowing such application have been fully

made known to Congress, through the Delegate from this Territory.
The committee can but reiterate those arguments, with the superadded sanction that experience has given to their truth, and request the Delegate to urge their importance.
The committee beg leave to recommend the adoption of the accompanying resolutions, and pray to be discharged from the further consideration of the subject.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
THO. M. BLOUNT, JOSEPH L. SMITH.
PETER W. GAUTIER, Jr.

Resolved, That the Delegate to Congress be requested to use his exertions to obtain a reorganization of our Territorial Government, so as to authorize the people to elect the Governor and Secretary thereof, and to have a Senate added to the Legislative Department.

<source>[LC:Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]</source>
<place-time>[February 14, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>Mr. Ward heretofore, offered the following Preamble and Resolution, to wit:
Whereas, it is desirable for the accommodation and convenience of the people of Florida, that facilities of communication should exist between the seat of the Territorial Government, the town of Jacksonville, and the City of St. Augustine in the Eastern District of Florida,—
and whereas it will be but just to afford the same facilities of mail transportation to the Eastern of the Territory, as are already enjoyed by the West, in a semi-weekly mail from Pensacola to Tallahassee.
And Whereas, it is believed that such an arrangement would promote the views of Government, and the public interest and convenience, by opening a direct communication between Savannah and Mobile, or New Orleans, with less than 240 miles of land carriage, over a country offering decided advantages for mail transportation. Therefore, Be it resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida, That the Delegate in Congress from this Territory be requested to urge upon the attention of the proper department the establishment

of a semiweekly mail, or if that be impracticable, a weekly mail, to be transported in four horse coaches, from Tallahassee to Jacksonville, on the St. John's river, and thence to the city of St. Augustine.
Which was again read and adopted.

<place-time>ATTORNEY GENERAL's OFFICE February 15th 1834.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR I have the honor herewith to return to the State Department the several documents transmitted to me with your letter of the 34
and 10" instant.” The case of Colin Mitchell particularly referred to in these papers, has been continued until the next term of the Supreme Court; but as there seems to be no good reason for adopting the like course in respect to the cases from East Florida the Court directed them to be brought on for hearing at the present term, and several of them are now under discussion.
Permit me to suggest that there is no reason to believe that another continuance of the case of Mitchell can be obtained; and that it is therefore a matter of the highest gravest importance to the interest involved in that case, that the investigation now in progress at Hanana, should be prosecuted with the greatest dillegence and that if any material documents should be found they ought without delay to be furnished to the counsel of the Government. It is also proper to remark that it was objected by the Counsel for M" Mitchell on the argument of the motion for a continuance of his case. that royal orders, commissions, and instructions issued by the Crown of Spain to the Governors and Intendents of Louisiana, the Florida's and Cuba ought to be sought for at Madrid, and not at the Havana and that it therefore was not highly improbable that any documents of this nature would be found at this place.
Without entirely yealding to this objection the counsel for the Government are so far impressed with a conviction of its truth, that they feel it their duty to request that another effort be made through the American Minister at Spain to obtain authenticated copies of the various royal orders & other papers indicated in an opinion & order of the Supreme Court delivered in the cases of Soulard & Smith in 1830.8° and in the letters of Mr Wirt of 1830 *
& 1833.” now on file in the State department. From the nature of

<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States.—
The Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, beg leave, again, respectfully to ask the attention of the Federal Government to the important project of effecting a communication between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico across the Florida Peninsula.
The excavation of the Ship Channel so long, and so anxiously contemplated, it is believed will not probably be undertaken by the United States." If it is to be abandoned your Memorialists respectfully present to the attention, and favorable consideration of Congress a project for creating such a communication, which they deem feasable, * Printed also in Fla. (Terr.) Legis. Council Journal, 1834, p. 134.
* See ante, p. 446, n.

to wit: by the Construction of a Rail Road across the upper neck of the Pinsula from the town of Jacksonville on the St. Johns River, to the Gulf of Mexico at the disemboguement of the river St. Marks.
The District of Country through which this Rail Road would pass, affords advantages, certainly not surpassed, perhaps not equalled in any portion of the United States of the same extent throughout the whole distance. The Country is level, of firm, solid foundation and the few rivers which the Road would cross are never subject to high or rapid freshets. In every portion of the route is found in the greatest abundance the finest timber in the world for such a construction, and a mild and delightful climate, where frost and ice never occur to impede its operation.
The Legislative Council, impressed with the belief that it is a measure perfectly practicable in its accomplishment and highly important in its consequences, not only with reffere [MS. torn] the interests and prosperity of the Territory of Florida but Peeeived believed in National light, as forming the most important link in the chain of inland communication between the extreme north and South, have at their present session incorporated “The Florida Peninsula, &
Jacksonville Rail Road” Company,” to construct a Rail Road from Jacksonville to Tallahassee,” a distance of about one hundred and forty five miles in a strait line to be there connected with the Tallahassee and St. Marks Rail Road, also Chartered at the present Session; * Without the aid of the General Government, this Great undertaking will be retarded for many years, or perhaps, totally fail of accomplishment. They therefore pray the attention of your honourable Body to the following Resolutions.
Be it therefore resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida, That the Delegate in Congress be requested to obtain from the Congress of the United, the appointment of an experienced Engineer to survey the route of the Contemplated Rail Road from Jacksonville to Tallahassee; and also to obtain the relinquishment on the part of the United States in favour of said Company of one mile on each side of the said route of the public lands through which it may pass—
And be it further resolved that the Delegate be further requested to obtain from Congress such appropriations of money, donations of land, or subscriptions to the stock of said Rail Road company, as their wisdom, and the importance of the object may suggest or justify—Be it further resolved that the foregoing memorial and resolutions, when signed by the Governor, and President of this

Report of the Committee on Finance of the Legislative Council In the Legislative Council of Florida Feby 11th 1834.
Mr. Chandler from the committee on Finance, to whom was referred, an enquiry touching the compilation of the laws of Florida, made the following REPORT:
The committee on Finance to whom was referred the resolution respecting the publication of the compilation of the statutes of this Territory respectfully report, That in answer to enquiries made by them in compliance with said resolution they have received a communication from one of the compilers, which is hereto annexed. By this communication it appears the work is nearly completed, and is expected to be ready for distribution with the laws of this session. The committee have examined the book as far as finished, and consider it well executed, in point of typography, and also that the system and arrangement adopted by the compiler has been judicious, and that the work will be valuable to the community. The book is more voluminous than was anticipated, being nearly 500 pages, and some delay has thereby, and by other causes, been occasioned, to its being finished, but as it could not have been distributed throughout the Territory till an appropriation was made by Congress, therefor, no disadvantage has resulted to the Territory. It appears also that the amount originally appropriated by Congress to defray the expenses of publication," (although the compilers render their services gratitously,) is insufficient & ef that the contractors will probably sustain a loss in consequence thereof.
The committee deem it advisable and important that a publication of the laws of '33, and '34, should be made on the same plan, and in the same manner, as has been pursued in the compilation up to
'32, and in order to make up the deficit in the former appropriation to the contractors and to obtain a continuance of the work in an uniform manner they herewith report a bill and resolution to the house.
EDWARD CHANDLER, Chairman.
* The appropriation act approved May 5, 1832 (4 STAT. 511), provided $2,000 for the publication of the statutes of the territory. A resolution of the Legislative Council, Feb. 3, 1831 (Fla. Terr. Acts, 1831, p. 96), had requested the delegate to obtain an appropriation of $1,500 for the publication of the statutes.

Which was read and agreed to.
A bill entitled “An act for the continuation of the compilation of the laws of this Territory,”*—was read, and ordered for a second reading on to-morrow.
Mr. Chandler offered a resolution which was read and laid on the table until to-morrow.

<docbody>SIR, I beg leave to recommend that an appropriation of twenty seven hundred and nineteen dollars and fifty cents be made as an additional appropriation “For the compensation, and mileage of the members of the Legislative Council of Florida, pay of officers and servants of the council, fuel, stationary, printing, and distribution of the Laws for the year 1833”, the appropriation for these purposes, by the act of 2" March 1833," being insufficient by the above amount.”

<place-time>[Referred February 24, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>To The Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled.
The Memorial of the Undersigned Judges of the United States for the District of Middle Florida, of East Florida, and of the Southern District of Florida respectfully represents That by the act of 23rd May 1828 supplementary to the several acts for the settlement and confirmation of private Land Claims in Florida,” in consideration of the duties thereby enjoined upon your Memorialists an additional Salary of Eight hundred dollars per annum was secured to them while in the discharge of the duties imposed by said act. That your Memorialists continued to receive said salary up to the end of the first quarter of the past year, when in consequence of a failure in the last appropriation act to provide for the payment of said salary to all the Judges, or to designate for which two of them the provision in said act was intended, the Officers of the Treasury, refused to pay it to either and thus the provision has been withheld from them all."
They would further represent that although the duties arising under said Law have been very unequally divided amongst said Judges (by far the greater number of cases existing in the Eastern District) Yet in point of fact, one or more cases still continue undecided in all the Districts including the Western District”
That it has not been owing to the conduct of your Memorialists that the said cases have not been finally disposed of in some of the Districts but to the wishes of the Officers representing the United States at whose instance, the causes have been continued for the purpose of receiving further evidence.
134 STAT. 284–286. 14 See ante, p. 856.
* A letter from Duncan L. Clinch to Del. White, Feb. 7, 1834, urging an increase in the compensation of the judge of the Western District is in NA (HF, 28 Cong., 1 sess.).

Your memorialists therefore respectfully urge that all the Judges, are by the Terms of the Law and in justice entitled to a continuance of the additional salary until all the causes are finally adjudicated and settled; And they therefore pray that an appropriation be made by your Honorable Body as well for the arreas due as for its future payments.
Your Memorialists would further beg leave to avail themselves of this occasion to present to the attention of Congress the inadiquacy of their Salaries, and to request that a permanent and suitable provision be made for their relief The present salaries were established at the first Organization of the Courts when their duties were comparatively light. At that time and for some years thereafter there existed but one court with two terms in each District and with an inhibition by Law to the Legislative Council to establish more than one other other Court in each District. In the year 1826 a court of Appeals was established composed of the Judges of the several Districts" and the prohibition being removed the Legislative Council have since established numerous Courts in most of the Districts by which the duties and labours of the Judges have been greatly increased. That the rapid increase of population and the consequent increase of business have contributed to the same results As an evidence of which it may be stated that in circuits composed of several courts, in some of the Courts where the business at first was merely nominal the Judges are now frequently closely occupied twice a year from three to five and six weeks. In three of the Districts the Judges are now obliged by law to hold from eight to eleven terms of Court each year besides attending the court of appeals annually, and in the other District there are held twelve or fifteen extra terms for the trial of admiralty causes in addition to the regular terms of the Court.
These numerous Courts in a widely extended and sparsely settled country expose them to very great labors and expenses in travelling while no provision whatever is made by law for the payment of any travelling or other expences incident to these courts or to the court of Appeals.
They would further state that the business of the Court of Appeals
(a Court created since the salaries were fixed by Law) has also greatly increased, the present Term being only now about to expire after a a session of more than four weeks—They beg leave to remind your Honorable body that the sphere of duties assigned to the Judges of Florida besides embracing all matters cognizable in the District and circuit courts of the United States include the cognizance of all causes
1. This court was established in 1825 pursuant to Sec. 4 of the act approved May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 46).

of a civil nature above One hundred dollars as part of their original Jurisdiction as also exclusive criminal Jurisdiction of all offences against the Laws of the United States and of the Territory of Florida They excercise moreover appellate Jurisdiction over all the inferior Courts and Justices of the Peace in the Territory.
Taking all these circumstances, into consideration they venture to assert that their duties and labors greatly exceed those of any District Judge of the United States. And they may also add that from the present condition of the country such duties necessarily involve greater expense of living, impose more personal privations, and subject to greater exposure of health than are incident to the office of any District Judge of the United States While the additional salary of Eight hundred dollars continued to be received your Memorialists forebore to complain altho convinced that even with that provision their compensation was inadiquate.
But now that they are to look to the tirmination of this provision so soon as the duties under the law shall cease they cannot in justice to themselves longer delay the representation of their case"
They therefore respectfully request that the Honorable the Congress of the United States will be pleased to make such permanent and additional provision for them as may be deemed reasonable and Just,—And Your Memorialists will ever pray &".”

<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled.
The Memorial of the Citizens of the Town of Apalachicola in the Teritory of Florida, respectfully sheweth:—That they Suffer great loss and inconvenience from the want of a regular Mail communication
" The Legislative Council in a resolution adopted Feb. 15, 1834, solicited for the judges a salary equal to that of the district judge of Louisiana (Fla., Terr., Legis. Council, Journal, 1834, p. 132; House Journal, 23 Cong., 1 sess., p. 449).
* Referred on Feb. 24, 1834 to the Committee on the Judiciary (House Journal, 23 Cong., 1 sess., p. 354). The memorial was also submitted to the Senate where it was referred on Mar. 5 to the Committee on the Judiciary (Senate Journal, 23 Cong., 1 sess., p. 167). See post, vol. xxv, Report of Committee on Judiciary, June 17, 1834.

with the interior of the Teritory and States of the Union. During the first six months of the last year our Mail was transported in Steam Boats direct to Columbus, Georgia; but from the great expence attending this mode of conveyance, together with the difficulty of navigating the river during the Summer months the Post-Master General has been induced to discontinue the route, and for several months past, your memorialists have had no regular mail communication with any part of the United States. Situated at the mouth of the river Apalachicola,—The only outlet to the rich products of her tributaries the Chattahootchie, Flint and Chipola rivers, extending for several hundred miles into the States of Georgia and Alabama—
With a population and business which already entitle us to rank in Commercial importance as the Third Port in the Gulph of Mexico–
A commerce giving employment to twelve Ships and Brigs as regular Packets to New-York and an equal number of Brigs and Schooners to New-Orleans, besides a large number of transient Vessels to those, and other ports of the United States, and West Indies. And at this time several large Wessels are taking in Cargoes for Liverpool, which is designed as the commencement of a direct Commercial intercourse with Europe. The estimated value of the Merchandize to be received here during the present year is upwards of One Million Dollars;— and our exports of Cotton and other produce during the same period will greatly exceed that amount. The Extensive tracts of rich land recently acquired from the Florida Indians and the Creek Nations in the States of Georgia and Alabama are now rapidly settling with interprising Citizens from the States the produce of whose industry will add ten fold to our commerce in a few years. In conducting this extensive business, your memorialists are dependent on private and irrigular opportunities of sending their letters into the interior to be Mailed for distant Cities; and it frequently happens that Wessels with valuable Cargoes arrive in the Atlantic Ports, ten days before the letters of advice with orders for Insurance. It has heretofore been supposed that this Town could only be approached by water;
but from the recent report of a Surveyor of the Public Lands,-
together with an examination by private Citizens it is satisfactorily ascertained that a good Road may be constructed from hence to St. Andrews Bay, a distance of forty-five miles, thence to Marianna a distance of fifty miles, where a road is already opened, but requires repairs and the erection of a few small Bridges; The whole of which can be done at an expence not exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars.
The opening of this road would enable the Post Master General to furnish the Mail established by Congress two years ago between this place and Columbus, Georgia, at comparatively little expence to the
446774–59–63

Department, and be a great public convenience to the Citizens of our Teritory and the adjoining States of Georgia and Alabama, as well as the great Commercial Cities of the North and New-Orleans with which we have our principal dealings.
We therefore respectfully pray Congress to grant an appropriation for those objects, and your Memorialists will ever pray &c &c—

<docbody>SIR, By a recent Act of the Legislative Council of this Territory, this place, formerly known by the name of “Mount Vernon” has been changed to that of Chattahoochee.” The Postmaster General has been advised of this change, and has altered the title of the Post Office accordingly.
The change of name was effected principally through my exertions.
The Arsenal in Alabama had the Same name, and the miscarriage of letters &c intended for the one, but directed to the other Arsenal, caused much delay and consequent embarrassment. An opportunity is now afforded of giving an appropriate name to this Arsenal.

<docbody>SIR, When the act of Congress of 1828 was passed providing for the adjudication of land claims,” a law agent was provided for, the sole purpose, of collecting testimony & dispatching the business speedily.
The only claims now to be settled are in East Florida, and your Law agent resides permanently at Tallahassee about 250 miles from St Augustine where the Court sits—I have just received a letter from the District Judge saying that unless these cases are prepared by the Collection of testimony between the Terms that it will require ten years to decide them. It is known to youthat this adjudication is

attended with very heavy expence to the government, & that these delays are highly injurious to the Territory, ruinous to the claimants
& prejudicial to the public justice of the nation—This Law agent rides to St Augustine once or twice a year with a salary equal to the Judge who holds six courts, & is the whole year employed, & I am informed that last summer he went off to the Western country for six months, neglecting entirely his public duties—The agent to be useful must live in St Augustine—Congress have twice stricken out the appropriation for his salary considering it a useless office, as the duties have been performed.
I ask the favor of you to consult Gen Call who is here as to the necessity of the Agents being in St Augustine—
If this is not done I must propose a law to abolish the office &
again strike the appropriation out of the Bill.
General Call who has been charged with this business as assistant Counsel will be able to point out some suitable person residing in St Augustine to prepare these cases, & bring them to an early trial so important to the United States the Territory, and the Claimants—
It is not necessary for the assistant counsel to reside in the District, but it is indispensible that the Law agent to be of any service should do so—

Thompson with the Indians has enabled him to induce the chiefs Blount and Davy and their people to emigrate without delay—The Agent is entitled to much credit for his exertions, and has by his success, disappointed the general prediction in this country, that the Indians now ready to emigrate would not go, until the amount due for their annuity was paid to them—You will observe that the Agent has promised the Indians, if the permission of the Department can be obtained, that he would himself attend them to their new residence and pay them their annuity—
You will also see that the Agent is desirous of visiting his family, his lady being in low health—And I shall feel deem it proper, if his Services are not absolutely required by the public business, to give him permission for a Short time to visit his family—

SIR. The enclosed letter will aid you in forming a correct idea how far the sum allowed for surveying the public land, is sufficient to defray the expense of surveying the private land claims in Florida. Four dollars per mile is the sum allowd by law in either case. In surveying the public land the shortest line ever run, except when the surveyor meets with natural or artificial obstructions, is six miles. In surveying the private claims the surveyor is compelled to pursue the calls of the grant, in which the courses and distances are continualy changing.
Another difficulty arises from the fact, that most of the grants made by the Spanish Government were never surveyed, and are located in swamps and Hammocks which are almost impenetrable.
It frequently occurs that days and weeks are frequently spent, in endeavouring to find the point of commencement, during which time the surveyor is exposed, to fatigue and expence, without any compensation whatever. In surveying the grant to Arredondo & Son the surveyor was employed near two months in ascertaining where to commence the survey. There are very few cases if any have occured in Florida, in which the surveyors have not lost money, as well as time and labour in surveying the private land claims.
Allow me to suggest as a matter of some importance to them, and as an act of justice, that an appropriation should be made by Congress for an additional compensation to those who have, as well as to those who may hereafter, perform services of this kind.

Exum to Complete the unfinished work on the Escambia River from the Basses Paralell to the south boundary line of the state of Alabama And alsoe to connect the surveys which had heretofore been done by us and James R. Donelson across said River which was attended with greate difficulty and expence—
Owing in the first place to the mistake which had been made in the Paralell line by Crossing the Bay. And owing to the work being almost entirily in the Escambia Swamp which was from Two to six miles in width—and the greater part of the work was the surveying of private claimes which caused great difficulty in the first place to assertain whare they were located and after this was done we then had greate difficulty in executing the work it being in the swamp which was almost impassable—We commenced the work early in the month of October and continued in the swamp till nearly the end of the year with from Eighteen to twenty hands imployed and during the whole of the time in addition to the hands and horses we had imployed—We alsoe had to imploy the assistance of Two Boats And when we had done the work as nearly as it was practable we returned to the office about the 1" of January 1832 for the purpose of making out our returns of the work which we had done and during the prosicution of which it was nessary for one of us to return to the Escambia twice for the purpose of correcting work which it was not known was nessary untill it was assertained by examinning the office—About the 15" of May. we made a finish of our returns to the office–And as a compensation for our work we received each about four hundred and forty dollars which left us in debt. after doing the work for nothing (and undergowing the maney privations which we underwent) about thirteen hundred dollars each—You will now sir while at Washington this winter apply at the Commissioners office and see the returns of Col: Buttlers office whare you will see the whole matter better then it can now be exsplained, 30 See ante, p. 885.

As the Representative of the people of Florida I beg leave most respectfully to submit to the consideration of the President, one or two observations—
Govenor Duval procured his confirmation in the Senate by a positive pledge to those who did not intend to vote for him, without an examination into serious charges that he would resign, & by various other political pledges & promises which I need not enumerate *-
Phagan who has since forged the papers to defraud the Goverment * was his intimate frend, and principal witness—
The nomination was confirmed, & he did not resign—Since that time he has made the office a sinecure—He was for seven or eight months before December last actually living in Kentucky—His Secretary acting as Govenor, & there are now here claims on the Govrment, & before Congress for clerk hire, because the Secretary was Govenor, & there was no Secretary—”
To avoid the adium of again leaving his Post and abandoning his public duties he wishes to put it upon the Govrment here, and get his expences paid out of the Territory—If the President will stop his salary during his absence I will venture to say he will not go-

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to enclose you a letter, or rather an extract from a letter of the Judge of East Florida—You will perceive that the difficulty suggested by the Judge arises from the fact that the Law agent lives 200 or 250 miles from where the court sits, & only rides once or twice a year to that place at the Regular terms—The testimony not having been collected in vacation the term of the court is greatly protracted at an immense expence to the govement—
The expence of this court as now conducted for this land adjudication is more than ten thousand dollars a year, & if it is to be continued ten years the accommodation of Mr Allen will cost the Govement $100,000—The truth is that this whole business might & ought to have been finished in two years, & now with an active law agent residing at St Augustine it might be concluded in one year—This delay is injurious to the Govement, unjust to individuals, and highly injurious to the Territory of Florida *—
There will be an effort made to strike out your appropriation, & a serious attack on the Department—
I hope I shall have it in my power to say that these abuses have been rectified—
I understand that General Call recommended Charles Downing
* In his message to the Legislative Council, Jan. 25, 1834, DuVal expressed himself in favor of the election of the governor by the people of the territory (Fla., Terr. Legis.

I was new to the Jurisdiction, & it was absolutely necessary that I should inform myself well upon the cases & their principles before decisions were made. But in relation to the trial of these cases, it should be provided by Law, that no testimony shall be received but in the form of Depositions—with such a regulation the cases may be decided in two years;

<place-time>Surveyor's Office TALLAHASSEE March 29* 1834.</place-time>
<docbody>SIR, As instructed in your letter of the 30" Dec’ last” I was about preparing instruction for the execution of the survey of the Town of S” Augustine, a practised and skilful Surveyor having been designated to perform that duty, and who in the execution of other Surveys near that place, took occassion, in anticipation of his instructions, to converse with the inhabitants and probably the authorities on the subject, and wrote to me on the 24" Ult. from which the following is an extract.
“We expect your instructions about the Survey of this Town or fear we will receive them, We have been informed, and no doubt Correctly too that not more than the One half of the Claimants to lots in this place have ever presented their titles papers to the Commissioners for Confirmation. M' Downing (who was one of the late Commissioners) told us to day, that that was the case, and owing to these facts we do not see how we could survey the Town without a conversation with you on the subject or some latitude given in your instructions”
The only mode of Survey, must be predicated upon the Concession of the Board of Commissioners, and their adjudication having been but partial it will readily occur to you, that a survey executed under such circumstances would be imperfect in the extreme; as I cannot permit (or sanction afterwards) any surveys which might be executed, not warranted by the legal authorities of the general government—
Under this view of the Subject I have thought it expedient to delay the Survey of St Augustine until I shall receive further instructions from you, and have notified the Surveyor thereof.
I have felt much anxiety of mind from not receiving any acknowledgment of the large and important returns made to your Office since my arrival from the West—I sincerely hope they may have safely arrived Expecting the return of the Deputies (in all this month) who have been engaged for some months past and wishing to meet their absolute wants in due time after their returns shall be received and adjudicated, and also wishing to Complete the surveys suggested in a former

letter including the Town of S" Augustine, I have, respectfully, to request that you will cause me to be placed in possession of the amount of my estimate, to enable me fully to comply with the Contracts, under similiar usage.

<docbody>To the Hon: the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States.
The memorial of the subscribers, inhabitants of the city of St:
Augustine in the Territory of Florida, Respectfully sheweth, That the encroachments of the waters into the harbor and upon the city have destroyed many buildings, and nearly the whole of one street; and that the appropriation of twenty thousand dollars, made at the last session of congress “for the repairs of Fort Marion and the reconstruction of the sea wall, at and near the same”,” being expended; accomplishes but partially the desired objects.
The undersigned further represent, that although we consider Fort Marion as only indispensable for the use of the united States for an Arsenal and Store Rooms for the purposes of supplies on this Station, yet that the protection of the public property, as well as that of individuals, requires the extension of the sea wall in conformity with the plan and estimates of the Engineer, hereunto annexed.
And the undersigned, would further represent, that every Engineer, (so far as their opinions have come to the knowledge of your Memorial-

ists) who has examined the said Fort Marion, is satisfied with its construction, and is desirous that it may be preserved in its primitive condition (exclusive of the wood work, which may at any time be replaced) for the purposes of continuing an ancient Fort which will for centuries be useful as a monument of Spanish operations, and as a place of deposite for Naval and Military Stores, of this portion of the Atlantic Coast. We would therefore respectfully pray that an appropriation, based upon said plan and estimates, may be made, that the work, now but partially executed, may be continued to its final completion; and as in duty bound, &c.

<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled.
We the undersigned, Citizens of the Town of Apalachicola, in the Western Judicial District of Florida, Respectfully shew, 1* That we have sustained great loss and inconvenience, for the want of a Superior Court possessing proper jurisdiction.
2" That the Judge of this District resides in Pensacola, which, by the route usually travelled, is four hundred miles distant from this place.
3* That said Judge is required, by law, to hold a Court here twice in each year; but that no Court has been held by him here for more than twelve months, and that the next regular term of said Court is now eight months distant.
4* That there are engaged in the trade of this place a number of Steam-Boats, besides many Ships, Brigs, and other vessels arriving and departing with valuable cargoes, creating a commerce that is already extensive, and is rapidly increasing.
5* That such commercial intercourse gives rise to many cases involving large and important interests, and often requiring the immediate action of a Judge exercising Common Law, Chancery, and Maritime Jurisdiction.
Believing, therefore, that we shall continue to suffer great and increasing loss and inconvenience, under our present Judiciary System, and that the commerce and business of this place entitle us to the consideration of Congress, we Respectfully pray, that Congress will immediately establish for us a separate Judicial District, giving to the Judgethereof the powers now exercised by other Judges of Superior Courts in Florida, and requiring him to reside at or near this place;
thereby affording us that certain and prompt administration of

<docbody>SIR. The Merchants and Citizens of this place having applied to Congress for the establishment of a separate judicial District to include the County of Franklin alone (the cause of which arrises from the geographical situation of Appalachicola, to and from which the intercourse is irregular and uncertain, and the Judge having the Choice of a more healthy situation, by the addition, or connection with other counties, would reside at such place as would destroy his usefulness here) and as the Officer of the Port for the collection of the Revenue I feel it my duty to request your favourable consideration of, and influence in effecting this object The importance of the Port to the Goverment cannot have escaped your observation, it would therefore be unnecessary on my part to enter fully in detail upon this subject, indeed I deem it sufficient to assure you that the commerce of the Port, of Exports and Imports
(coastwise principally) are but little short of Five millions of dollars for the current year, and according to fair estimates will nearley double that sum for the current year of 1835—added to which, active and I believe effective arrangements are in progress for the export

of Cotton directly for Liverpool, the proceeds to be invested and Imported here.
In the absence of Court of competent jurisdiction much inconvenience is experienced in the discharge of my duty, and all Commercial, Criminal or Civil liabilaties are in a State of the greatest inconvenience and disorder *

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS FROM THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF TRUSTEES OF PENSACOLA COLLEGE</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time>[April 23, 1834]</place-time>
<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States.
The Memorial of the undersigned, the Executive Committee of the Trustees of the Pensacola College, most respectfully represents, That at the last Session of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, an act was passed incorporating the Trustees of a College, to be located in the City of Pensacola, with power in them to confer Degrees and Diplomas in the sciences, and with the common corporate rights and privileges—
Your Memorialists respectfully represent to your Honorable Bodies that in this act the Legislative Council was governed no less by the wishes of the Citizens of West Florida, than by the peculiar fitness which the City of Pensacola possesses for a Literary Institution-
This peculiar fitness is obvious to all who have any correct knowledge of Pensacola, and to bring it to the notice of your Honorable Bodies, your Memorialists would represent; That the City of Pensacola stands upon the Bay of the same name, a short distance from the Navy Yard of the United States, the Fortifications, Hospital &c:
it is blessed with a most abundant supply of the purest and finest water—with a mild and healthy climate, and with an exemption from those fevers and other diseases, whose ravages have often been so very much felt in most of our other sea-port Towns; it is accessible either by land or by water at all points, as well for the Citizens of Florida as for those of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia; its in-
* See post, vol. xxv, Report of House Committee on the Territories, Dec. 30, 1834.

habitants are sober, moral and industrious. Pensacola is now the most interesting portion of The Territory of the United States on the Gulf of Mexico, arising from its being the Rendezvous of the West India Squadron and in the immediate vicinity of a Navy Yard, Hospital, Forts and other public works belonging to the United States, and necessarily the resort of many intelligent officers and others:
every circumstance indicates that it is destined to become the most commercially important in the South West portion of the United States. Its harbour is one of the finest that can be imagined: easy of access—safe—capacious. The extensive Bay on which it stands, can with a very small expense, be made to communicate on the west with the Bay of Perdido, thence with the Lake Borgne, and the River Mississippi: on the north, the River Escambia one of the Tributaries of Pensacola Bay, is navigable and extends far into the interior of Alabama: on the East, the sound of Santa Rosa connects the Bay of Pensacola with that of Choctaw hatchie, and invites an internal communication with St Andrews, St Joseph and Apalachicola Bays, and thence with the Atlantic: on the south the entrance into the Gulf of Mexico is over the safest and deepest bar on the Gulf.
A Rail Road to connect Columbus in Georgia, with Pensacola, is in agitation, and for this purpose the Legislative Council of Florida have incorporated a Company. Should this work ever be perfected (and there is every reasonable prospect that it will be in a very few years)
the entire commerce of a large wealthy and populous portion of Georgia as well as of Alabama will flow through Pensacola: intimate associations and relations will grow up between those respective portions of our Common country, and the interests of the one will become identified with the interests of the other.
Wherefore your Memorialists would respectfully represent to your Honorable Bodies, that Pensacola from its location—its vicinity to public works of the United States—the salubrity of its climate—
its exemption from disease—its abundance of wholesome and fine water—its facility of access—its prospective commercial importance—
and the character of its citizens—is peculiarly fitted for an extensive Literary Institution—such an one as would supply the Literary wants of all that extensive Southern and South Western country, which blessed with superior fertility of soil, enjoys a less salubrious climate than has fallen to the happy lot of Pensacola.
The importance and utility of such an institution are obvious;
its benefits are apparent to all. With your Memorialists the only difficulty is, how shall it be endowed and sustained?—and yet—even this difficulty looses all its force and dissolves itself into mere solicitude, when we reflect under what kind of Government we happily live, and to whom we have the honor to address ourselves. We live

under a Government whose stability rests upon the virtue and Intelligence of its Citizens: We have the honor to address Those to whom the people have delegated the power of watching over their rights and of making laws for their preservation—Your Memorialists rest with entire confidence upon the disposition of your Honorable Bodies to do every thing, within the compass of your legitimate powers, for the advancement of improvement literary, social and political among the Citizens of this widely extended empire: they look to you, without a doubt of your willingless to assist every project which has for its object the amelioration of the Condition of your fellow Citizens. Without your generous assistance, they despair of carrying into effect the present object, which addresses itself so forcibly to the best judgment, to the fondest hopes and to the most refined feelings of your Memorialists—Living in a Territory as yet with a sparse population and with little wealth, although in one, which promises, at no very distant day, to be one of the brightest stars in the Constellation of the American Union, your memorialists candidly admit, that the means of putting the institution committed to their charge, into operation are beyond their reach or the ability of the Territory: They therefore naturally turn their eyes towards Congress—a Body from whose beneficence immense benefits have been already dispensed to Florida.
Your Memorialists therefore respectfully solicit from Congress a Grant to the Trustees of the Pensacola College, and for its benefit, of the whole or a portion of the Township of Land heretofore set apart by Congress for the use of a College in the District of West Florida, and also a Grant for such lands belonging to the United States, either in Florida or elsewhere, as shall be sufficient to create a fund for the founding of their College: as also the right and title of the United States to such Lots, water Lots and water privileges in the City of Pensacola, as have not been asked for by the Trustees of the Pensacola Academy; and also a Grant for the site of the old Forts near Pensacola for the erection of the College Buildings with such a quantity of public Land adjoining from one to two hundred acres, as will suffice for all the necessary out buildings, offices, Gardens &c.;
and also for a Grant of the Cantonment as a place of temporary accommodation for the Students and Professors, as soon as it shall cease to be occupied by the United States Troops And your Memorialists as in duty bound &c.

<docbody>R. BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, Your letter of the 29" ult” has been received.” In executing the Survey of the City of St. Augustine, the lines of the several Streets forming the boundaries of the different Squares, are to be first run and marked, and then the lines of the particular lots in each Square which have been actually confirmed by Congress. If, as you have been informed, there are individual claims to lots, which have

not been acted upon by the Commissioners, it is entirely owing to the neglect of those claimants, and the greatest extent to which we can now go to protect their interests from the effects of their own inattention, will be for you to direct the Deputy making the Survey, to note the Supposed limits of all such claims as he may have good and sufficient reasons to believe are private property, although he must be positively prohibited from making any actual survey of the boundaries of such alleged claims.
When the Survey is returned to your Office you will forward to me a Separate plat of each Square, exhibiting, on a convenient Scale, the dimensions and contents in feet, English measure, of each lot or tract actually Surveyed, with the proper references to the confirmation in each case; and designating by dotted lines those lots which are claimed, but not confirmed, with the names of the present and original claimants thereof, So far as the Deputy may have been enabled to ascertain them. These plats of Squares are to be accompanied by a general plat of the Survey of the City.
The returns alluded to in your letter were duly received, but under the great press of business now requiring the immediate attention of this Office it has been found impracticable to give them an examination.
I have this day requested the Secretary of the Treasury to remit you the Sum of $10,000 on account of Surveying the public lands, that Sum being the largest amount which can now be transmitted to you, in consequence of the appropriation Bill not having passed Congress.
I am &c. ELIJAH HAYWARD.
