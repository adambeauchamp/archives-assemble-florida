<docbody>The Committee on the Territories to whom was referred the several resolutions of the Legislative Council of Florida," Report:— That by the last Act of Congress" providing for the election of members of said council it was provided that the representation thereof, should be appointed by the Legislative Council, Since that time thre[e] new counties have been established, and the powers of Said council not being adequate to give to them a participation in the legislation of the Territory, this act to equalize the representation thereof is necessary. The Legislative Council consists of about eighteen or twenty members, and it appears by their appropriation Bill that they employ nine clerks, about one clerk for every two members, the result of which, most unnecessary and unaccountable increase of offices, has produced annually appropriations for arrearages to cover balances due for printing the laws, and other useful and necessary objects. The regular appropriations being absorbed by this host of Clerks. Last year the appropriation was exceeded $2400, and this year the sum demanded over the usual appropriation is about four thousand dollars. The committee think it necessary to check this growing evil, and to reform this manifest abuse, in the local administration. They have also this year added, one more printer to the list of publishers of the laws, and have provided for payment to a clerk in the Executive Office, which Congress has repeatedly refused to Sanction.—Among the extravagant items to Swell the appropriations, are excessive sums for revising, stitching laws, Printing-Jetraals, making Manuscript copies for laws for State Department, when the laws are directed to be printed, and can thus be preserved in a much more useful form.— As the organic act of Congress declares, that their acts are in force until annulled by Congress,” the Committee deem it indispensable to have their acts sent every year to the two Houses of Congress, that all obnoxious provisions may be annulled. The Section of the act relating to Judicial proceedings," affects existing remedies, prevents the execution of judgments rendered in obedience to existing laws, and impairs the obligation of contracts, and is therefore annulled. The Act regulating the terms of Courts in East Florida," provides a more convenient and economical arrangement, and requires the approval of Congress before it can go into effect. The Committee have provided for the annulment of all such items as appear not to be properly chargeable upon the United States, and to avoid the payment of those obnoxious items it is important to act on this Bill before the passage of the appropriation Bill- [Endorsed] Report N° 431 equalize representation in Florida (With Bill N° 457)" April 30 1834 Mr. Williams from the Committee on the Territories made the following report *— </docbody>

<dochead>DELEGATE WHITE TO WILLIAM WILSON</dochead>

<place-time><location>WASHINGTON,</location><month>May</month><date>8</date><year>1834</year></place-time>
<docbody>Dear Sir—I send you a Bill and Report, relating to the local Government of Florida and making some important changes.” This Bill gives the new Counties a member of the Council. It was considered proper that every County should have one Representative without regard to the number of its population. Although numbers are the basis of representation, and equality in the distribution is just and desirable, it cannot always be attained. When I came to Congress, the President appointed the Legislative Council, and nearly the whole body were selected from Pensacola and St. Augustine. Considering the geographical divisions of the Territory, or the Judicial Districts of East, Middle and West Florida, * Nominated Apr. 9, 1834, and confirmed May 8 (Senate, Exec. Journal, IV, 390, 401). the representation is as equal as I could make it, and as the Legislative Council have power to regulate the whole subject, they can make such amendments as may be necessary. The truth is that there are petty politicians in all communities who live by exciting popular tumult. There may be some of these to find fault with the arrangement, and compare the numbers of some Counties with others. Exact equality is impossible. It was my wish that Leon county should have had three, but the committee would not consent to that number in any County, and as the Legislative Council sits in that County, it is probable the wishes and interests of the people will be duly considered and taken care of.—Every one will admit that this is a great improvement. I regret to say that the expenditures of the Council created some dissatisfaction here. They have been limited by this bill. The arrearages would never have been provided for if this bill had not been reported and passed. The subject was taken up in both Houses, and the report of the House of Representatives you will find printed and enclosed herewith. The other Report drawn up by an eminent statesman and lawyer, would have been made by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, if this bill had not been taken up out of its order, and passed in the House of Representatives. The 21st section of the Judicial act, produced great dissatisfaction. Though it might be expected that I should feel some interest on the subject, when its object was so apparent, I did not feel the slightest concern—I did not consider it of sufficient moment to answer the first letter I received on the subject. The law as applied to all past liabilities is a nullity, and will be so regarded. It is unconstitutional and void. It would have produced no emotion here, but for a letter from Mr. Thompson, in which he stated that it had actually been pleaded to exempt a deputy marshal from his defalcation from a liability created, and adjudged under existing laws. The Legislative Council never could have intended this for such a purpose. If it has been smuggled in with any design to be used in that way, the object could never have been perceived by the majority of the Council. To declare that an execution shall not issue on a judgment rendered, is not only unprecedented, but is in fact a contempt of Court. As applied to every thing which occurred before the passage of the law, it is unjust, unprecedented, unconstitutional and void. The Legislative Council could never have intended it to be so applied; and the Court will maintain its jurisdiction and legal rights by disregarding it. Fortunately too, the 25th section of the Judici- ary Act of the U. States gives a writ of error for any amount, to the Supreme Court in all cases where the Constitution is involved.” In one week more the act will be annulled, but I should have been equally willing to refer it to the Courts. The committees were unanimous in considering it unconstitutional, and in violation of the organic law, as applied to all liabilities prior to its passage. I am your most ob’t servant, JOS. M. WHITE. WILLIAM WILSON, Esq. </docbody>

<docbody>The undersigned Merchants, Marriners and others interested in the Commerce and navigation of the Gulph of Mexico but more especially of the S. Marks Bay &amp; River—Beg leave respectfully to represent the necessity of a Light House on South Cape Promontory which forms the Western Shore of Apalachie Bay— By reference to a Map of these waters it will be seen that South Cape is the most prominent point of land and the first which is made by all Vessels approaching the Coast and bound for S' Marks—Its distance from S' Marks Light is more than 20 Miles, in a South West Course—The eastern coast of the Gulph below the bay abounds in Shoals extending a great distance from Shore, and Vessels coming from that or a Southern direction in avoiding the danger of these Shoals invariably make the first land off the abovementioned point— From such a distance the Light at S*Marks situated as it is entirely within the Bay contributes nothing to the guidance or safety of Vessels of the larger class—A Light on that point would therefore be of the highest importance, not only to the trade of S’ Marks but to Vessels approaching the Coast, and bound to more Westerly Ports—Besides the reasons here given others of equal force are to be found in the dangerous shoal which extends from the Cape itself to a distance of of New Orleans—Wessels arriving from the Westward derive no benefit from the light at the Mouth of this Harbour which cannot be seen until after completely doubling the Cape, and the smaller as well as the larger classes of Vessels are obliged to Anchor or lie to at a distance of 25 or 30 Miles from Shore from the danger of approaching too near these shoals, —This in bad weather is always attended with great delay inconveniance and danger.—A light on the Cape would insure safe navigation to Apalachie Bay which bringing the S' Marks Light in view would enable the vessel to steer into safe anchorage ground- It is universally conceded that the present light should have been placed on the site which your Memorialists are now solicitous to have one erected and it is understood to have been the wish of the present Superintendant to have it placed but that the site having been selected it could not be changed— G M Lyons Jn" Bright Jno a mackinder Cap" of Brig, Arathusa Wm Sims Richard Betts J.

As the machine &amp; boats can be of no use for any other work I would recommend that it be sold at auction at Apalachicola where it will be wanted to fill up their Docks &amp;c with. It will be remembered by the Department that an experiment was made to cut off some bends in the Apalachicola river &amp; reported as unsuccessful. Time has however proved to the contrary as they have washed away as much as it was thought desirable when the work was done.

<place-time><location>TALLAHASSEE</location><date>8</date><month>June</month><year>1834</year></place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR I learn that the Delegate from Florida has caused a bill to be introduced in Congress to provide for the Sale of certain Lots at St Marks in this Territory." S' Marks is situated within the boundary of the grant to John Forbes &amp; C° to establish which, a Suit is now depending in the Supreme Court of the United States, in the name of Colin Mitchell and others, vs The United States.” This claim you will discover is founded on a Sale made by the Indians to the House of John Forbes &amp; C** At the date of this Sale, St Marks was a regular Fertress Fortress garrisoned by the troops of Spain. It continued to be occupied as a Military Post, until formally delivered to the United States as public property under the 2"Article of the Treaty of 1819. Perhaps nothing could involve a greater absurdity than the proposition, that the Indians, most of whom inhabited the Territory of the United States could convey to a company of foreign Merchants, an extensive body of land within the dominion of Spain, and on which was situated a Spanish Fortress, then garrisoned by her troops. To obviate this absurdity the Counsel for the claimants now contend in argument that they do not claim the land within gunshot from the Fort, although the grant expressly conveys all the land within its limits without any reservation whatever. This is however, most evidently, a conclusion formed since the commencement of the Suit, and since perhaps they found from the facts placed on the record, they could not maintain their right to the Fortress, and it might present a most embarrassing feature in the whole claim. That they did claim it originally, and that they do still claim on the Record all the land within the limits of the grant, I refer you to the Petition of the claimants found at page 15 of the printed Record of the case, in which they say “they are not apprised that any portion of the land claimed and within the proper boundary of the same as established by the said cession of 1811, is held by any title adverse to their own, unless it be a few Sections or portions, entered or sold by the United States without a knowledge of the boundary of the Same.” The land thus refered to in the Petition is situated Six or eight miles from S' Marks, and is no part of that which the Bill before Congress authorizes to be sold. But if it were otherwise, it is evident from the language of the Petition, that it is still claimed as a part of the grant. The Petition was no doubt intended, and to be good, must conform to the provisions of the Act of 1824 found at page 872 of Clarks Land Laws.” This act requires a particular designation of the boundary of the land claimed, and requires the Petitioners to set forth fully and particularly in their petition whether “the United States be interested on account of the lands within the limits of such claim, not claimed by any other person than the petitioners.” If these Petitioners did not intend to claim the land on which the Fort is situated, and that within gun gun shot from its walls the fact should have been specified in their Petition. As the record now stands they do present a claim to this as well as all the rest of the land within the limits of the grant. Knowing as I do from mortifying experience the disposition of the Court to avail itself of every circumstance however remote, or trivial to sustain the claims against the government, it has occurred to me that if the Bill should be passed by Congress authorizing the Sale of the lots at S*Marks, that an argument will be based on this fact, to show that there was nothing absurd in the Sale of the Fortress by the Indians and that though the claimants could not take the Fort and the adjacent land under the Sale, yet the Sale for the residue of the land is good. The reason assigned why they do not claim the Fort and the adjacent land is, that the Laws of Spain forbid the Sale or grant of lands to individuals within gun shot of the Fortifications. That is very true, but that Law is not more imperitive than the law which directs lands to be granted only in proportion to the ability of the grantee to cultivate and improve them. It is not more imperitive than the law which declares that lands shall not be granted to foreigners who have not taken the oath of allegiance, Nor is it more obligatory than the law which directs that the land shall not be granted to individuals on the Sea Ports. Yet these several laws have all been violated in the present grant. I have thought it my duty to give you this information, that you may should you think it necessary, either have the passage of the law opposed, or have it so expressed as not to effect the interest of the Government on the trial of the important case now depending in the Supreme Court. I have not seen the Bill and therefore can form no opinion on the Subject. I have given you the facts from which you will be able to form a just conclusion after reading the Bill."

WHITE– The undersigned Citizens of Jackson County in the Territory of Florida, respectfully represent, that under the existing arrangement of the Post Routes they are without any mail communication with the adjacent Counties in Alabama with which, from their vicinity, they are in great need of a direct communication. The present route extends from Webbville to Campbelton, by which this section of the Country is Supplied with the Tallahassee Mail weekly but if we wish to avail ourselves of a mail communication with the Citizens of the adjacent Counties of Alabama living at a distance of twenty or forty miles from us, our letters must take a most unnecessarily circuitous route, either by Marianna, Mt Vernon, Columbus (Georgia) Montgomery (Ala) or by Pensacola, Blakely Claiborne &amp; Sparta (Ala). This inconvenience, we earnestly hope will not much longer exist, as we think it need only to be known to be remedied. We are satisfied that the Citizens of the Counties of Henry, Dale, Covington, &amp; Conecuh in the State of Alabama feel equally anxious as ourselves for a Mail communication, so much needed by them &amp; us— By the proposed alteration of the Post Road from Marianna to Oak Hill now making the Village of Webbville will be deprived of a mail, or must with us be supplied by a seperate route from Marianna. In this event we beg leave to suggest as the most judicious arrangement, that the route be extended from Marianna Fl. via Webbville &amp; Campbellton to Daleville in the State of Ala. The distance is not greater than fifty five miles from Marianna to Daleville, &amp; the additional expense of transportation will be but trifling when compared with the benefits resulting to the Citizens of West Florida &amp; the adjacent counties of South Alabama. Permit us therefore to direct your attention to this Subject &amp; to request that you will take such steps as you may deem necessary to effect an object so much desired. JACKSON CO.

<docbody>THE HON. E. WHITTLESEY, Chairman of the Committee of Claims, House of Representatives, Washington City.— SIR, In reply to your letter of the 4th instant," covering a petition of Messrs: Russ and Roach of Florida," I have the honour to state that the persons named, with others, engaged to repair the military road in Florida from Pensacola to Tallahassee, in the manner and within the time set forth in their contract, of which the paper submitted with your letter is a correct copy. In the early part of the spring of 1833 I received information from various private sources that the labour expended upon the road was intirely misapplied; and on the 15th of April I received a communication from the District Attorney of West Florida with a presentment by the Grand Jury of Washington County of which paper numbered 22 T E E R H TO RIA. L. P.A. P.E. R. S. Papers No. 3 &amp; 4 are copies of reports from Captain S. Shannon appointed to inspect and receive the road from the Contractors"— From the latter report it will be seen that they declined appointing an Inspector when called on to do so. No. 5 is a copy of my instructions to Captain Shannon directing him to apply the appropriation to the repair of the road, in the manner which he might think best." No. 6. Is a copy of a letter of Captain Shannon," with a copy of an account of Mr. Russ for labor said to have been expended on the road and for other objects connected with it. These papers contain all the information which I am able to give on the subject of the contract. The contractors having abandoned the work, and failed to appoint an inspector according to the terms of their contract, when required to do so, forfeited all legal claim to payment for the labor performed; and no other course was left to the Department but that which I directed in my letter to Captain Shannon. I think however a fair compensation should be made to the Contractors for the labor actually performed, so far as it was advantageously applied; but Congress only can authorize it." I return the petition, Contract and other other papers: and I am, Sir, &amp;c. Note:—The papers referred to in the foregoing letter to the Honorable Chairman of the Committee of claims, numbered from 1 to 6, inclusive, will be found as follows, viz:—No. 1. Letter W. No. 121, Book of Letters received, No. 13.—No. 2. Letter H. No. 92., Same Book. Nos.: 3 &amp; 4. Letter S., Same Book,-Nos. 423 and 430.— No. 5. Letter from the Quarter Master General to Captain S.

<docbody>M” Bibb made the follg report with Senate bill N° 205 The committee on the Judiciary to whom was referred the Petitiehs memorials of the citizens of the counties of Walton &amp; Escambia,” praying for an increase of the Salary of the West judge of the Western District of Florida, respectfully report to the Senate, That the petitioners, are numerous, seme of thena including the grand jurors impannelled at the November term of the Superior court for the County of Escambia, in 1833. The petitioners concur in representing that the Salary of fifteen hundred dollars is inadequate, compared with the onerous duties, &amp; travelling to which the judge of this District is subjected: That at the time the Salary of fifteen hundred dollars was established, the judge was required to hold his the courts but at two places, the ene at Pensaeela; the ether Pensacola, and such other place in the District, as should be designated by the Legislative Council. That by Subsequent acts of Congress, the Legislative Council have been authorized to compel the judge of this District to hold courts at such places &amp; at such times as the said Council should direct: * and in pursuance of that authority the Council have required the judge to hold courts twice, in each year, in Six counties: that another court has been added by Congress &amp; by the Council,” A court of Appeals, to be holden once a year at Tallahassee, by all the judges:* That the judge of the Western district, in addition to the twelve terms of the Superior court in the Six counties, and the term of the court of Appeals, is compelled to hold two extra terms, the ehe for the trial of admiralty cases, the one at Pensacola, the other at Appalachicola; that he is compelled to reside at Pensacola; that Appalachicola, is growing in business &amp; importance, &amp; promises to become one of the most commercial places on the Gulph of Mexico: that in travelling from Pensacola to Appalachicola, the judge is subjected to great charges &amp; risks, by the great distance &amp; difficulty of passage between these two places; that he is now compelled to travel not less than two thousand miles every year in the performance of his official duties, which travelling is through a new country with a population thinly scattered: Moreover they state that formerly the judges were allowed an extra compensation of eight hundred dollars per year, each, for adjudicating upon the land claims: but at the last Session of the Congress, this extra allowance was directed to be continued to two of the judges only, whereby neither the judge of the Western District, nor any of the other judges, have received it, the act not designating which two of the judges should receive such extra compensation, there being land claims in all the districts. The petitioners state, that from the labours imposed upon the Judge, the expenses, difficulties, &amp; distance he has to travel, a salary of three thousand dollars would be but reasonable. Your committee is of opinion that the Salary ought to be increased and according report a bill, “To increase the compensation of the judge of the Western district in the territory of Florida”.

The further sum of Four thousand Dollars, enclosed in Treasury warrant, (appropriation Public lands) and forwarded to me at Jackson Tennessee in all the month of August will enable me to meet all demands against the Office, until the return of the contemplated surveys in next Year—Trusting confidently that in all these matters you will see nothing to disapprove, I remain Very Respectfully Y.

<docbody>SIR I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7" Inst,” together with an extract of the 3"Section of the act for the gradual improvement of the Navy of the United States “approved March 2" 1833," and an extract of a letter from Wylie P. Clarke Esq " late Live Oak Agent to your Department in which Mr Clarke Says that Maj Clements informed him that “thousands of Live Oak trees have recently been cut down by trespassers on Public Lands on St Johns River and on the Atlantic Coast,” and that a private company there have lately furnished an order for Naval timber to the amount of $120,000 In reply to which I have to observe that I have made Some enquiry in relation to this matter and am perfectly Satisfied that Since the discontinuance of the Live Oak Agency in this District (where my attention has been more particularly directed to this Subject) or indeed for Some time before, no considerable number of Live Oak trees have been cut in East Florida upon any lands public or private. Of the order for naval timber mentioned by Mr. Clarke I know nothing; and cannot find a person who has ever before heared of it; if Such an order has lately been furnished to any person here, I am very Sure that it has not been filled In a country where the population is So Sparse as it is in this, and where the Surveys are necessarily old &amp; the lines consequently difficult to trace, it would not be extraordinary if persons in procuring Live Oak timber Should, with the best intentions, occasionally pass the boundaries of private right, or that a few trees Should be cut on public lands; but of the Small quantity which has been cut within the last few years, the greatest part has no doubt been obtained from private lands the titles to which have been confirmed; or from the principles Settled by the Supreme Court in the Land Cases taken up by appeal from our Court and lately decided there) must as a matter of course be confirmed. The United States Surveyors have lately Surveyed in this District as public many tracts of private lands which are embraced in the two classes above mentioned, those which have been confirmed, because the proper evidence of that fact was not furnished them; and those for which claims are now pending in our Court under the acts of 23" May 1828 * and 26th May 1830," which provide for the Settlement of Land Claims in Florida, because by their instructions they were only authorised to Survey as private lands Such as the keeper of the “Public Archives” would certify had been confirmed Upon these tracts which were considered &amp; treated by the Surveyors as public lands, Some Live Oak trees may recently have been “cut down,” and it was these doubtless, to which Maj Clements alluded; but it is very Singular that notwithstanding that gentleman while he was in this District was frequently at my office, and other public offices, he never once mentioned the facts Stated by Mr Clarke to myself or (So far as I can learn) to any other officer of the government, or any one else here. I Shall make farther enquiry upon this Subject and no pains on my part Shall be Spared to prevent the committing of trespasses on the public lands, or to bring offenders to justice. That no one may plead ignorance of the law I have caused the act entitled “an Act to provide for the punishment of offences committed in cutting, destroying, or removing live oak or other timber, or trees reserved for naval purposes.” approved March 2" 1831”" to be published in the Florida Herald a newspaper printed in this City." I was induced to do this in Some measure by the fact, that Several Saw Mills have lately been put into operation in this District for the purpose of Sawing lumber for exportation, Some of the proprietors of which as was reported to me were procuring pine logs from public lands to Supply their mills; and an idea Seemed to prevail that there was no law prohibiting the cutting of pine trees on the public lands, and that it might therefore be done with impunity. While upon this Subject permit me to Suggest whether it may not be advisable to charge the marshal of this District with the duty of protecting the “Public Timber” he has a deputy in almost every county in the District who must of course be well acquainted with the Situation of the lands and what is done upon them in his county, and the marshal must from the nature of his duties; either in person, or by his Deputies be constantly passing through the country to Serve process &amp;c. and can better attend to the interests of the government in this behalf than any other public officer, and as it would come in his way; he could afford to do it for a much less compensation than a Special agent: &amp; besides the District is So extensive that no one individual can properly discharge this duty, and the interposition of an agent is So Seldom necessary, that the expediency of keeping Special agents in constant pay may well be doubted as may the propriety of leaving this portion of the public property entirely unprotected. With great respect I am Sir your obedient Serv" THO DOUGLAS THE HON, LEVI WOODBURY Sec; U. States Navy Washington City [Endorsed] Ack" &amp;c Tender thanks for the information which he has furnished. Full confidence is reposed in his zeal and vigilance and it is not doubted that all proper means will be used by him to prevent depredations on the public property.

<docbody>SIR I herewith inclose my quarterly accounts of disbursements for improving Apalachicola Harbour for 2" Qr 1834 and a monthly report of operations of same work for June 1834. The improvements at Apalachicola have been completed according to the original plan of them: with a success answering their highest expectations.” Vessels of all classes that trade to Apalachicola pass the new channel freely. A Ship from Liverpool passed up to town a few days since through it. I perceive by a vote of the House of Reps that the “Harbour Bill” was laid on the table.” Should this embrace the funds asked for the St Marks Harbour &amp; River, I would suggest the propriety of requiring a fund for Apalachicola Harbour to pay to St Marks Harbour &amp; River the value of the Boats, Machinery &amp;c furnished by the latter to the former work, which is justly chargeable to it, and that the said boats &amp;c be also sold for the benefit of the latter work. Had a proper allowance been made for these fixtures there would have been funds enough last year to finish the St Marks river to make it boatable for the last six months. The situation of this river is now such that for the want of a few Hundred dollars, the amount expended upon it will be of no avail if nothing more is done. The channel of the river has washed considerably in debth where it has been worked upon, and but for some stumps that were left too high and were intended to be cut lower had the funds held out last year boats could at this time be used on the whole extent of the river improved—It is estimated that the surplus fund of the Apalachicola Harbour with the proceeds of the sales of the boats &amp;c will be sufficient for this service required, as may be seen by my last annual Report &amp; Estimate. I hope to be pardoned for this anticipation of a failure to accomplish an important improvement that has been nearly brought to completion, and for suggesting “Ways &amp; Means” for it. The interest I feel in the work impels me to this course. I will further mention to the Department that I have in a great measure promoted a scheme for a Rail Road from this place to St Marks. A Company for which is now formed and about to go into operation, and I have engaged to serve as Engineer for them provided my duties were such that I could find time sufficient for it, which would be the case were they the same as heretofore. This is a work of the first importance to this country and to get an Engineer from the north would be too great an expense for the Co. in its present state: And as I have promoted the work thus far I feel anxious to see it in progress of construction before leaving the country, I would therefore request, if I should not be continued here on duty, that I may be allowed a furlough till Jan. to forward this enterprise." I have the Honor to be With Respect &amp; Esteem Your Obt Servt GEO W. LONG Lt Arty Engr duty GENL C. GRATIOT Chief Engr U.S.A. P. S. Should the Surveys of the Mouth of the Suawney river and the eastern pass into Apalachicola be required I would remark that it would be convenient for me to perform these services. There is a Steam Boat at St Marks for the Suawney trade that is offered for her expenses for the former service, and I am already familiar with all of the obstructions in the latter and should have only to examine their extent. I have passed these, numerous times on my visits to Apalachicola Harbour [Addressed] Genl Charles Gratiot Chief Engineer U.S. Army Washington D. C. [Endorsed] 366. July 1. 1834 L. G. W.

Should the app for S' Marks not pass suggests that the Machinery &amp;c be taken from S' Marks river &amp; used on the Apalachicola be paid for from the app" of the latter and the amount applied to the S' Marks; also, that the Machinery &amp;c referred to be sold &amp; the proceeds also applied to the S. Marks. Should Surveys of the mouth of Suawaney river &amp;c be made he can perform that service conveniently—Should he not be continued on duty in that section of Country, wishes a furlough until Jan’ for the purpose of acting as Engineer to a Rail Road from Tallahassee to S' Marks. rec" 17 July" </docbody>

<docbody>TO GENERAL, WILEY THOMPSON, Elberton, Georgia. SIR, At the late Session of Congress, an Act was passed to provide for the organization of the Indian Department. This act was approved 30th June 1834,” from which date it took effect. By its provisions the Superintendency of Florida, and the Sub-agencies within 34 7" E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S it, and the services of all persons attached to it, not authorized by treaty Stipulations, are discontinued. The duration of your own agency is limited to the 31st day of December next. This period was designated under the impression that the removal of the Seminoles would commence within the year. No appropriation, however, having been obtained, all that can be done the present season will be to make the preliminary arrangements. You will be advised by the Commissary General of Subsistence, of the measures contemplated for the fulfilment of the provisions of the treaty, which are connected with this subject: Meanwhile it is desirable you should return to your agency, as early and speedily as the state of your health will permit. The prompt preparation of your accounts, and the Settlement of all the business of the Superintendency, up to the date of your arrival in Florida, is indispensable. The Sub-agents have been advised of the change, as it effected them. Their compensation and duties and the pay and employment of all others, not sanctioned by treaties, will cease upon the day of the receipt of that letter of advice. Every account should be forwarded as early as practicable, and when the Settlement is completed, the balances that may be due to yourself or others will be remitted. Your own compensation is unaltered. All annuities for Indians will hereafter be paid by Military officers, designated by the Department.” The annuities for the Seminoles, and the sums appropriated in fulfilment of treaty provisions, and for the current expenses of your agency and the Superintendency will be remitted, with the necessary instructions, when the Department is informed that you are on your way to Florida. The duty of investigating the claims against the Seminoles for Slaves and other property, alledged to have been Stolen by them, and for the payment of which Seven thousand dollars have been appropriated, is entrusted to you. You will proceed to collect and embody the evidence of the parties, and report all claims, that in your opinion ought to be considered as within the intent of the treaty. You will be allowed your necessary expenses, while performing this duty, and if the circumstances should seem to demand it, a small extra compensation."— I am, Sir, &amp;c., ELBERT HERRING POST ROUTE ADVERTISEMENT [PO:Proposals for Mail Contracts:Pr.] July 10, 1834 PROPOSALS For carrying the Mails of the United States for four years, from January 1st, 1835, to December 31st, 1838, on the following Post Routes in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida Territory,” will be received at this Department until the 20th day of October next, inclusive; to be decided on the 31st day of the same month.

<docbody>SIR, Sometimes in the month of May last I had the honor of depositing in the Post Office at Key West, a letter addressed to the President of the United States;" covering my accounts against the United States, (certified by the Judge of the Southern District of Florida) for the Sum of eleven hundred dollars, for services rendered by me in two land cases pending and decided in the District Court at Key West. In that letter I took the liberty of saying that as I proposed visiting my wife's family here, I hoped the President’s answer would be directed to me accordingly. Permit me Sir very respectfully to inquire whether my claim is included in the appropriation bill of the present or past year and if so, to what quarter I may look for payment.

<docbody>TO CAPT. J. B. F. RUSSELL, U. S. Army, &amp;c, SIR, I enclose copies of recent Acts of Congress, relating to Indian Affairs, and of Regulations" for giving them effect. Under the authority vested in the President by the 4th Section of the Act, to provide for the organization of the Indian Department,” you have been selected to make the payments for the Seminole and other bands residing in the Territory of Florida. The Specie annuity due them amounts to Five thousand dollars; and the further sum of one thousand dollars is payable for the support of a Blacksmith's establishment. You will obtain a draft at the Treasury upon the Bank, which is nearest and most convenient, for which you will receive specie, and transport it to the agency by the safest route. You will communicate with the Indian Agent Gen' Wiley Thompson as to the time and place of payment. These will be determined by him, and he will also make the preparatory arrangements for the payment. He will obtain the necessary provisions by requisitions upon the ass' Commissary at Camp King, to an amount not exceeding three thousand rations. The payments, on account of the Smith's establishments, will be made upon the requisition of the Agent, attached to an account, receipted by the parties, and attested by himself. The law prohibits any allowance for your Services, beyond your actual travelling expenses. As it is possible, that Gen.' Thompson may not be able to return to the agency, at the time it shall be necessary to perform the duty herein assigned you, I have to request, that you then execute his duties, as prescribed in the Regulations. And that you will take such measures, as you may deem necessary for the safe keeping of the buildings of the Agency, and other public property, until his arrival. You are requested to inform the Commanding Officer at Camp King of the time and place of payment, that he may be present. 40 7" E R R H TO RIA L P A P E R S. The sum of Three hundred dollars is included in this requisition in your favor, and is to be applied to meet the cost of transportation and other incidental expenses. If more should be required, you can draw upon this Department." I am &amp;c., ELBERT HERRING. </docbody>

<docbody>COLONEL JAMES GADSDEN, Wascessa, near Tallahassee, Florida. SIR, Not having succeeded in obtaining an appropriation at the last session of Congress to complete the repair of the road from Pensacola to Saint Augustine, it will not be in my power, I regret to say, to do any thing on that important route. I hope to be more successful at the next Session. It is really extraordinary that Congress should direct the building of an arsenal in Florida, within a single march of the Shore of the Gulf of Mexico, and deny the means of opening avenues to it by means of which only could we defend it in time of war, or even in peace, in the probable state of the British West Indies.” With respectful consideration, &amp;c. </docbody>

<docbody>To CAPT. J. B. F. RUSSELL, U.S. A. Washington, SIR, Intelligence, recently received for Gen.' Thompson, induces the belief, that he may not be able to return to Florida immediately. It is probable therefore, that it will be necessary for you to assume more of the duties of Indian Agent, than was contemplated on the 21st instant." That you may be prepared to do so, a personal interview with Gen' Thompson is desirable. You are therefore instructed to proceed to Elberton in Georgia, the place of his residence. You will ascertain from him what part of the public business urgently demands attention, and the best means of accomplishing it; the public property requiring care, and the best means and agents for securing it. The time at which the annuities have usually been paid, and the most economical mode of assembling and provisioning the Indians, and making the payment. If the rations required for the Indians, convened at the payment, cannot be procured from the Commissary's Stores at Camp King, you will purchase them upon contract, to an amount not exceeding three hundred dollars. The accompanying blanks, with the regulations, exhibit the form in which your accounts and vouchers will be made out. They will be transmitted to this Office through the Indian Agent. I enclose an extract of a letter from Col° Gadsden, relative to a robbery of Blunt, the Appalachicola Chief, alledged to have been committed by a man named Price.” This man, it is stated by Gen." Thompson, resides upon the Chatahoochee, near the State line of Alabama.” He may be sheltered by the Slaves or Indians in the Territory. I will thank you to made the discovery and apprehension of this person, a principal object, while you are in the Territory; and to communicate whatever intelligence you may collect, to the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The funds for the payments in Florida will be given to you in a Draft upon Charleston. This Draft you will probably have no difficulty in cashing at Augusta. You will obtain such kinds of Specie as you shall learn from Gen.' Thompson will be most acceptable to the Indians. You will call upon M* Richards whenever you may require the Services of an Interpreter."— I am &amp;c., W. WARD, for Elbert Herring, Com” &amp;c. </docbody>

File), enclosing his memoir on the improvement of the Escambia River (present). and his account still remains unsettled, although it has been put in suit. And besides this, I give you below the substance of charges preferred against him while Post Master, which he met by what amounted merely to a general denial, but which were so far sustained as to cause and justify his removal. He was charged with being suspected of an improper agency in the loss of several sums of money enclosed in letters and deposited in his office for transmission by mail. That the most respectable merchants of the place had so little confidence in him that they sent their letters to be mailed at an office 40 miles distant:—that he had opened a letter in his office addressed to another person, without authority to do so— that he was habitually intemperate—that he was suspected of destroying M" White's report, left at his office, to be sent per mail—that he charged double postage on single letters, and that he mismanaged the office generally. And after his removal he held the office in defiance of his successor, untill after proceedings were taken into Court, and a special order sent by the Post Master General—conduct highly improper and reprehensible.

<docbody>GENERAL, The bad condition of the mail road between this place and Blakely induced me, in passing over it lately, to make a memmorandum of its present state and the cost of completing or making it good, and I respectfully beg leave to submit for your consideration the inclosed estimate for that object" This road has been cut out and so far completed as to admit of the travel of the mail coach on it by the mail contractor at his individual expense, the distance by it from this to Blakely is but 50 miles, being 12% miles shorter than the old road; 17 miles of the distance is within the Ter” of Flo. the other 33 miles is within the State of Ala but passes altogether thro. public land The making or rather the finishing of this road is important to government on several accounts first for the reason that it is part of the route of communication between the Mil” Post at this place and that at Mobile point and between this and the Arsenal at Mt Vernon Ala, it is also part of the mail route to Washington and the North, as well as to New Orleans and Mobile and is in that respect important to both the Mil” and Naval establishments at this Station, and it will at the same time inhance the value of the public land, thro. which it passes, to a much greater amount over its present worth than the cost of making the road It is desirable to complete this road in preference to repairing the old one on acct of the distance being so much shortened by it and the expense will not be much greater than that of repairing the old road which must be done or it can be no longer used ” I have the honor to be Sir, With grt respt Your obt Servant S.

<docbody>SIR I inclose you my accounts of disbursements during the last Quarter, with a List of Balances of Appropriations for Apalachicola and St Marks Harbours and Rivers,” and the Statement of expenditures on the Same, for the year ending 30" Sept 1834 with that of the Ocklockney River. " The expenditures on the latter river has been to clear it of rafts &amp; trees that obstructed it, agreeably to the plans first adopted. It is now open for navigation about 150 miles to a point 8 miles from this place. The improvement of Apalachicola Harbour to the opening of the “Straight Channel”, which has been attended with the greatest Success: So that the vessels of the largest class trading to that place pass through it to the wharves of the town”—It remains yet to be determined whether or not it will be necessary to obstruct the other outlets of the river to throw the water more forcibly into the new one. Should it be necessary—the funds in my hands will be enough to construct a boom on the main one to retain the drift-wood and effectually force so much of the water into the cut as not only to keep it clear but cause it to deepen. The expenditures upon the St Marks river have been to improve it by opening a channel to a point about 2 miles South of the St Augustine road, and it was intended that it should be completed by this time for barge navigation, but the want of funds last year and the high waters of the present have prevented—The heavy rains of this Season have caused the river to rise so as to prevent the possibility of working in it. The work is therefore suspended for a time The expenditures in the harbour have been in the preparation of a diving bell on the plan of my last report made to you; the completion of which has been retarded by the Sickness of the hands employed to construct it and the difficulty of procuring others to work. It is now nearly ready for operation, to be imployed in deepening the cut in the Devils Elbow; which consists in removing the broken stones, from blasting, that the dredging buckets could not take up, while the work was carried on— The funds available for this improvement as well as at Apalachicola I deem sufficient for the purposes designated above: and thus I make no estimate of funds either for a new appropriation or the final completion of the works, as the present available ones may be taken for the latter *— I have the honor to be with Respect &amp; Esteem Your Obt Servt GEO.

<docbody>BENJAMIN F. BUTLER Esquire Attorney General of the U.S. SIR, As there is little hope that the Commissioners appointed for the purpose of reclaiming the Louisiana and Florida Archives at Havana will be able to complete the examination of the vast mass of papers,” from which the selection is to be made, before the next term of the Supreme Court, it has been thought best to make a direct and explicit application to the Governor General of Cuba for such documents as are more immediately required, in reference to the causes now pending, and of which the decision cannot be delayed beyond the next winter. This course is adopted, under the idea that there may possibly be some books or records, within the knowledge and control of the Authorities of the Island which may cast light upon the disputed titles, and from their containing, or omitting to contain, the proceedings in relation to the grants, in question, may afford evidence either of a positive or negative character in favor of the United States, but which from some cause have not been submitted to the inspection of the Commissioners. If such should exist, it is thought that a direct appeal from this Government to the Captain General may be the means of drawing them forth, and securing the benefit, if not of the originals, at least of authenticated copies. Although it must be admitted under a knowledge of the circumstances which have already expired, in relation to this business, that the chance of any favorable result from this application, is very small, there is yet an unwillingness on the part of the President, that any step should be omitted, which may, by any possibility, elucidate the supposed rights of the Government in these controverted questions. I have the honor to request therefore, in order that the intended application may be made, in such manner as to preclude all doubt or evasion on the part of those to whom it is addressed, that you will state with as much precision as you can, the nature and description of the documents for which a demand should be presented— It may be proper, at the same time, to mention that it is not intended by this proceeding to interrupt the examination which M" Robinson has been, for some time, conducting, but that all the papers selected by him, which may be thought of any consequence, in reference to the causes alluded to, are expected to be received in this country in time to be laid before you, previously to the commencement of the term of the Supreme Court.”— I have the honor to be, very respectfully, y' ob. Serv" Signed—ASBURY DICKINS, A. Sec. P.S. As you may wish, before you give the opinion above requested, to see the letters in possession of the Department, from Mr Wirt, the former Attorney General, upon the Subject, they are sent herewith for your perusal.— </docbody>

The settled determenation of a Majority of the influential Chiefs of this nation, to disregard the obligations imposed on them by the Treaty at Paines Landing,” with the temper indulged by them towards Holate Emartla, as Manifested in Council, added to the threats which we have heard have been made against him &amp; some of his Chiefs, satisfies us that, that Magnamous Chief who is so faithfull to his engagements with the U.S. is, with his confidential Chiefs and families, in some danger—We are therefore decidedly of Opinion that if Holate Emartla should ask for the protection which you have suggested to us, that would be afforded to him &amp; others who are in danger by permitting them to go to the Reserve on Apalachicola River abandoned by Co' John Blunt, there to remain until called upon by you to return &amp; join the emigrating Indians, it is due to him to afford that protection—Justice—humanity and our feelings would induce us to afford the suggested protection without hesitation, should the protection be asked Very Respectfully Your Ob"Sev" (Signed) J B F RUSSELL Cap' US Army WILLIAM M GRAHAM Cap'4" Inf Com" Fort King Fl" [Endorsed] Copy letter Cap" Russell &amp; Graham To Agent</docbody>

<docbody>SIR On the 1* ins' Cap' J B F Russell U.S. Army and myself arrived at Camp King *—On the succeeding morning I called in the adjacent Chiefs gave out broken days for the assemblage of the Indians at Camp King on the 21" ins" to receive their annuity, that being the earliest day they would assent to; and I told them that I did not wish any of them to assemble before that day, as I would not be at liberty to issue provisions to them before the day appointed for the meeting; and I admonished them to be punctual to the appointed time Some of the leading Chiefs did not arrive until the evening of the 22* and them that were in attendance earlier would not consent to meet me in Council until the absentees should arrive; consiquently the first meeting occurred on the 23” when I delivered to them a talk the substance of which you have enclosed * On the succeeding day they in answer to me gave in substance what you have appended to my talk of the 23" I told them I could not receive their talk as anything like [an] * answer to the propositions which I had submited to them, and that I must have a direct answer—They requested that we should take time and deliberate on the Subjects, under the influence of friendly feelings &amp;c-I told them that as some of the propositions were very important to them it was my duty to give them reasonable time to make up their minds upon those points, but that when they should retire to deliberate upon those propositions, to carry with them the recollection that what I had said to them was in persuance of instructions from the Government—conformable to the stipulations of their solemn Treaty, and therefore must stand The succeeding day on their intimation, we again met in council, when they, through the same Chiefs repeated in substance what they had said the preceeding day—I expressed to them my regrets that they should so openly manifest a total disregard of the obligations of their Solemn Treaty with the United States They then requested that I as their Agent and friend would give them my views &amp; opinion upon the subject of their relations with the United States: in complyance with which I gave in substance what you have in my second talk herewith inclosed—During the delivery of my second talk I was frequently interrupted by some of the Chiefs, especially a leading Chief who was a member of the exploring Deligation, a circumstance so unusual in an Indian Council as to satisfy me that they were not only affraid that I would produce a proper impression on the minds of the Indians, but that they are obstinately fixed in a resolution to disregard the Treaty of Pains Landing" While I was pourtraying to them the inevitable &amp; utter ruin which would overwhelm them were it possible for them to remain in their present location a fiew Years longer, silence ensued their previous frequent interruptions, they were awe struck by the pictures I presented to them of utter dessolation and hopeless wretchedness, and their minds, especially Micoanopas (whom the Indians look to as a principal Chief) seemed ingrossed and deeply interested. At that important crisis I heard Powell a bold &amp; dashing Young Chief who was seated by Micoanopa, and who is vehemently opposed to the removal of the Indians speak to the latter, apparently in much earnestness; and the Interpreter informed me subsiquently that Powell then urged Micoanopa to be firm in his resolution— Holate Emartla, one of the principal Chiefs displayed a magnanimity of character and a nobleness of soul merriting a better fate than that which I fear awaits him—He was in very bad health, said but little, but that little was a bold &amp; manly declaration of his determination to adhere in good faith to his engagements with the United States, and it was coupled with a reproof upon those who evinced a disposition to prove faithless. Holate Emartla and Fuckaluste Hajo one of his confidential Chiefs, are of opinion that their own people &amp; party embraces about one third of the Nation. These two Chiefs informed me secretly, that their lives were threatened that they believed themselves &amp; families with some of their people are in danger and they appealed to me for the protection which would be afforded to them by permission to visit their friends on the Apalachicola River under expressed stipulations that they will promptly return to the Seminole country or join the Indians on their emigrating journey when called on by me—This protection I have on mature deliberation determined to afford them when it shall become obviously necessary: but I directed Holate Emartle to be on the look out, stay as long as he can in safety, as I confidently expect that the Government will soon enable me to protect him &amp; his people here, which he seemed delighted to hear. If however he finds himself in great danger before the much to be desired moment when the Government will have a sufficient Military force in this section, I have determined to permit him &amp; such of his people as are in most danger, to occupy the Reserve on Apalachicola River recently evacuated by Co' John Blunt &amp; his party there to remain under all existing treaty limitations restrictions and provisions, until called thence. You have herewith enclosed a copy of the opinion expressed to me by Cap" Russell &amp; Graham as to the necessity &amp; propriety of the permission which I have determined to give to Holate Emartla.” A full view of all the circumstances leaves me without doubt that these deluded people have determined to resist the execution of the Treaty of Pains Landing, and I now have as little doubt that this delusion has been induced by some of the causes of hostility to emigration suggested in my Report to the Superintendant of Indian Affairs in Florida, dated the 1" of January 1834 *—There are many very likely Negros in this Nation: Some of the Whites in the adjacent settlements manifest a restless desire to obtain them; and I have no doubt that Indian raised Negros now in possession of the Whites— some of the Negros in the Nation, with some of the Indians, have been induced by bribery or other wise, to stir up hostility among the Indians to the intended emigration, for the purpose of detaining the Negros here until the Territorial Jurisdiction shall be extended over the Indian country so as to enable fraudulent Claimants to prosecute their claims in the Territorial Courts: Or in the general scramble which [may grow out of a worse state of things give] "the avaricious &amp; unprincipled an opportunity to effect their object by some other means— It could not have escaped observation that the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder &amp; Lead—I saw one Kegg of Powder carried off by one Chief, and I am informed that several whole Keggs were purchased. I did not forbid the sale of those articles to the Indians, because as such a course would have been a declaration of my apprehensions, it might produce a sudden and immediate eruption—It may be proper to add that I was heretofore informed that the Chiefs have a deposite of Forty or Fifty Keggs of Powder, which I did not credit at the time. Having thus given you a full view of the existing state of things here, I feel it an imperious duty to urge the necessity of a strong re inforcement of this Post, and the location of a strong force at Tampa Bay, as early as possible—An imposing force thus promptly marshaled to coerce these refractory people will have the effect to crush the hopes of those who have been tampering with them—awe the Chiefs into a proper respect for the Government—Afford protection to the neighbouring white settlements, and superceede the necessity of Holate Emartla &amp; his followers fleeing the country— I was informed that it has been usual to make presents to the Indians during the payment of the Annuity—I did not feel myself authorized to pursue the custom, and therefore declined doing so—I did however distribute among them a small quantity of Tobacco, an article as indispensible in their estimation almost, as provisions— In pursuance of your instructions, I am desirous to close the business of my Superintendency of Indian Affairs in Florida—I cannot however accomplish this object until I receive the requisite funds—I did anticipate the arrival here of the funds necessary to effect this object some time ago but owing I presume to the want of Mail facilities, I have not received from your Department any communication of a later date than the 6" of August last"— I have commenced the settlement of the business of the Superintendency as instructed, up to the date of my arrival here, which was on the 1* ins' opportunely closing the 3" Quarter of the present year To that date Cap" Russell on my requisition paid the Striker in the Seminole Smithery—Eben Beale, the Black Smith whom I left employed, abandoned the Shop on the 5" of May last—He was consequently only paid to that date, at which time Capt Graham employed a Slave belonging to the Suttler here, M Erastus Rogers, to supply Beales place until I should return to the Agency—This Slave was employed because a white man could not be obtained who could be relied on—Since my arrival I have sought to employ a white man as Gun &amp; Blacksmith, but fear I shall not be able to obtain one in this Country who can be relied on.

<docbody>SIR, I beg you to excuse the liberty I take, in addressing a few words to you, on the subject which I consider as proceeding from the negligence and inattention of the Marshal of this District in his official duties. He has a very fine room in our new Court Hall, in which his office is kept; but it is the last place in this city to find him or his Deputy, at the usual hour of business. His office is shut and no person in it, either in the forepart of, or afternoon of the day, unless he be accidentally there. This is a real inconvenience, often important to members of the bar. He has a very good Deputy, and when obliged to leave his office on business, it appears to me that his Deputy should be found in it. But in fact, not one time in twenty, has he any occasion to leave his office on business. It must proceed from sheer idleness. His office hours need be only from 9 o'clock in the summer and 10 o'clock in the winter until 2 o'clock, our dinner hour in this country; and not at all after dinner. 64 7" E R R H TO RIA L PA P E R S. I have not the least personal objection to Mr. Blair, our marshal. He is a very polite and amiable man, and faithful in his attention to business placed in his hands; except the difficulty to catch him at his office, to put business in his hands, or to examine papers in his office. As his appointment is from the United States, no Territorial authority can regulate the discharge of his official duty, nor does our judge of the Superior Court conceive that he can make any rules respecting it. The Clerk of our Superior Court is equally negligent, in attending at the usual hours of business in his office. But our judge of the Superior Court, if he see fit, can himself order a remedy of that evil,— In truth, I am sorry to say, it is a prevalent vice in public offices in this country With great respect, Your ob' Serv" JOHN RODMAN Collector of S*Augustine HON.

<docbody>SIR. An Act of Congress was passed at the last Session authorizing the survey and laying out of a Town at St Marks in the Territory of Florida; and the disposing of one half of the Lots in the Same *—As this act originated in the Solicitude expressed by this community on the subject; I may be excused, I trust, in conveying to you the continuation of that solicitude as to its early execution—The interests of the Middle District of Florida have been very much affected for the want of a Commercial Depot and a home market for the produce of the Country—Nature pointed out the site of the Old Fort of St Marks as the most eligible; but the peculiar situation in which it was placed precluded the possibility of obtaining such an individual right to property as would justify improvements on the premeses—The old buildings of the Fort have been occupied as Store houses &amp;c untill they have become no longer tenantable, and our Planters generally in the disposing of their crops have been subjected to tributes, and embarrassments, which the growth of a Town at a site so favourable as that of St Marks can alone remove—These considerations induced many of them, and the undersigned among the number, to urge upon our Delegate and Congress the necessity of an act similar to that which was passed the last Session—The Legislative branch of our Government having listened to our Memorials, we have only to look to the Executive for the consummation of the benefits of the law passed in our behalf—May I again invite your attention to this subject; with a hope that the Surveyor General of this Territory may speedily be charged with the necessary instructions for carrying into effect the Act of Congress for the Survey and the laying out &amp; settling of the of a Town at St. Marks— respectfully Your ob st JAMES GADSDEN May I take the liberty of saying to you that patents for land purchased 4 &amp; 5 years since in this Territory have not yet been received— I have myself several tracts in that situation; the Patents for which I am very much in want of— [Addressed] Mr Heyward Commissioner of the Land Office Washington City [Postmarked] Tallahassee Flo" Nov 10 Free 25 [Endorsed] Wascessa.

<docbody>HON J. M. WHITE House of Representatives D* SIR I was not aware until a day or two since, that the good citizens of Indian Key had applied at the last session of Congress to have their Port made one of entry; * and understanding that their application is again to be presented, I am induced to address you a few lines on the subject, as I am in some measure bound to interest myself for the Commercial welfare of our own people.— You are probably aware that Indian Key is a small Island—70 miles or thereabout from Key West containing about 10 or 12 acres— almost an entire rock—the principal rendezvous for the wrecking vessels.—There are about 150 people residing upon it, all more or less connected with the “wrecking-business”,-which is the only one in which they can engage.—The place offers no facilities for trading, excepting to a very limited degree, and unless they get our Admiralty Court removed thither, they cannot expect to have any importations from Foreign Ports even if their request should be granted, unless the inhabitants should think proper to import West India Produce to the amount of their own consumption.— I do not know what reasons may have been advanced by the applicants, but it is evident to us that the measure is aimed at the prosperity of Key West:—the supposition obtaining, that if able to get the Key made a Port of Entry it will be a stepping stone towards the removal thither of the Admiralty Court from Key West; and that then the entrance, adjudication &amp;c of wrecks will be all within themselves—That such regulations may be necessary some years hence is not impossible, but they are not certainly at present, as every facility is granted the people there they can possibly require consistent with propriety &amp; the laws, by having an officer of the Customs stationed there who grants permission for landing of Merchandise out of Coasting vessels; and is permitted to execute other duties not strictly in the line of his functions as an Officer of the Customs, but which under the peculiar circumstances of the place the nature of their trade &amp;c I consider proper should be left discretionary with him.—I hope this statement of mine will have some weight with you for I assure you, constituting Indian Key a Port of Entry—will be a most unpopular measure here.— You must pardon me, if before concluding—I diverge from public concerns to those of a private nature—My commission expires in January—and my application for renewal is on file at the Department—Should there be other applicants for the office you probably know it and if in that case, you will consult with my Father-in-law, Mr. Parker of New Jersey, -upon what will be best for my interests, I shall consider it another obligation added to those already received by * Dr Sir Your Obedt Serv't W.

SIR, I have received your letter of the 1st instant,” on the subject of the reported unwillingness of the Seminoles to remove West of the Mississippi—I agree fully with you in your views on the subject. I have not the least doubt but that the arrangement with them was fairly made and fully understood. I know by experience how easily the Indians are induced by the representations of interested men to delay their own engagements and to determine upon a course utterly irreconcilable with their promises and their welfare. The views you have taken as to the proper measures to be adopted meet my entire concurrence. And you will see by the enclosed Copies that the course indicated by you had already been determined upon by this department. I trust that the orders given will be found sufficient to obviate the difficulty.

Stephen Richards late Interpreter on the Apalachicola River a copy of which you have enclosed The Negro man Jim alluded to in the letter is believed to have great influence over his Master Old Vacca Perhassic, for which reason I took a great deal of pains to impress Jims mind favourbly upon the subject—I think there is no doubt that Econchattee Micco &amp; his band will go whenever Vacca Perhassic shall consent to do so—Shall I visit them for the purpose of effecting their removal? They may be disposed to follow Blunt to Texas—Blunts Wife is a Daughter of Vacca Perhassic: or they may prefer to surrender their reserves in terms of their Treaties—should they be disposed to follow Blunt they will of course it is to be presumed, expect a liberal allowance for a relinquishment of all claims within and upon the United States—If they prefer to surrender their reserves in Terms of the Treaty, and emigrate to Arkinsas, it is barely possible that they may insist upon some allowance in addition to the sums stipulated by their Treaties (Three thousand dollars for each reserve) for such surrender: And I suggest this bare possibility for the purpose merely of submiting to the Secretary of War whether it would not in such an event be advisable to add a small sum—if found indispensible—for the purpose of effecting a total removal of all the Indians from this Territory Should it be thought advisable to intrust me me with the duty of makeing the attempt to effect the object of their removal, please favour me with full instructions upon the subject—If the information afforded by M.

So long as the Seminole Indians remain in East Florida, troops will be required at Fort King; and the most convenient and least expensive avenue through which to supply that post would be the Ocklawaha, if properly improved.” </docbody>

Now the Grant calls for the “Water Pen” about 2 miles south of the Lake, the Survey calls for. M" Waldrons could not shew any part of the old line and gave it over until M. Levy came. The Survey of the grant is made on the South side of the Lake called for in the survey. The reason I have alluded to the Original Survey, is that if I ever should be Called on again to make the survey, I should be glad to hear from you on the subject, as the old Survey and calls of the Grant do not agree. I think I have done my duty as a Deputy Surveyor about that claim— On the opposite side of this leaf you will find a copy of the notice delivered to Charles Waldron, as agent of M Levy.

<docbody>DEAR SIR. The present plan of discharging the claim of the Legislative Counsel is very objectionable. The small amount due to each member occasioning the necessity of seperate drafts and seperate certificates by the governor imposes it seems to me a very unnecessary trouble. Wher'fore may not the Sec of the Treasury alter this? Much incovenience will be saved, if he would direct the appropriation to be placed in the Union or Central Bank of this place to the credit of the governor; and for cautions sake, make the same to be drawn out upon the check of the Secretary approved by the governor; or either being absent, upon the check of one of them. Please bring this to the consideration of the Sec. The Legislative council is shortly to meet, and the proposed arrangement will be matter of much convenience to the members. - An act of Congress passed 18 June sec 4 says “the expenditure of the Legislative Council for pay, mileage, printing &amp; incidental expenses shall not exceed $7,000.” " But in the Civil list appropriation passed afterwards (27 June) there are appropriated $9.173." Now which will the Secretary be directed by. The first sum will not answer, as you will perceive by referring to the estimate I sent you by the last mail. That estimate proposes $10.305; &amp; in it there is nothing new I believe expect $300 proposed for a Messenger Why it it, that every Bureau office at Washington is allowed some one to clean the rooms—make fires, go to the po. office and take care of things, &amp; the same thing be refused to the governor of a territory. After a short time Florida, it is probable will be the only one remaining. A clerk to keep the records up is necessary; and the Council by appropriating from their funds $400 have admitted the necessity. But the Council may discontinue this; and withal no qualified young man can be obtained for that sum; It is practacable to obtain some young man, who pursues other business, &amp; occasionally gives his attention to our records tho not exclusively. If Congress would give a clerk at $800 the records might then be properly kept up, which heretofore has not been strictly the case "- Very respectfully J. H EATON JOS. M. WHITE Esqr [Addressed] Jos.

<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress Assembled. The Petition of the undersigned stock holders in the Tallahassee and S*-Marks Rail Road Company respectfully represent. That Your Petitioners under a charter obtained from the Legislative Council of Florida, aided alone by their own resorces, have engaged in an enterpise to construct a Rail Road from Tallahassee to S. Marks in the said Territory. S. Marks was delivered by the Commissioner of the Spanish Government to the Commissioner of the United States under the treaty of 1819 as public property. That the land at and ajoining to that place belongs to the Government of the United States. That the old Fort of S. Marks has long since been abandoned by the Government as a Miletary Post and is now in a state of delapidation and ruin. That the said Fort was erected by the Government of Spain in the Year 1759 as a defence against the neighbouring Indian Tribes, and is not calculated either by its position or its structure to defend the Bay and Harbour of S’ Marks against an approach by Sea. That neither the Old Fort or the situation on which it stands can ever be advantageously used by the Government as a place of defence, as will more fully appear from the report of the Engineer Lieu' G W Long hereunto annexed.” Your Petitioners further represent that the land ajoining the Old Fort of S. Marks for the Distance of near one mile is an impenitrable Marsh except where it has by artificial means been elevated for the Construction of Roads or other purposes. That the grater part of it is covered with water at every high tide and that without great labour and expence it can not be appropriated to any use whatever. That although in its present condition it is of no value, yet by the successful enterprise of your Petitioners in the constructing a Rail Road to terminate at that Point and the facility it will afford for the transportation of earth to fill up the Marsh, and elevate the ground above the flowing of the tide, the said land will become valuable and an important acquisition to Your Petitioners. Your Petitioners further represent that some of their fellow Citizens, with great labour and expence have ditched and elevated a small portion of the ground near the Old Fort, on which they have erected warehouses and other buildings. Wherefore Your Petitioners pray that after granting to each of said individuals one lot of ground to be surveyed in such manner as to give to each the benefit of his improvements as near as practible consistant with the future convenience of the place." That Congress may be pleased to grant to the Tallahassee and S' Marks Rail Road Company one hundred acres of land embraced in the following boundries (to wit Commenceing at low water mark at the Point of confluance of the Rivers S* Marks and Waccolla and entering up the Margin of said Rivers, untill by a direct line from one River to the other there will be included the number of acres as aforesaid according to the plat herewith exhibited And your petitioners further pray that Congress may be pleased to grant to the said Company the land on which the said Road may be located and for the distance of one hundred yards on each side thereof, so far as the same may pass though the lands of the United States" R J Wellford Tho: Brown Sam Reid Ben.

<docbody>SUPERIOR COURT-EAST FLORIDA Extracts from the Presentments of the Grand Jury for the Counties of St. Johns and Mosquito at the June Term 1834– The Grand Jury further present that the final completion of the inland Steam Boat Navigation from the Northern to the Southern and Western States has long been regarded by every enlightened and patriotic citizen as a desideratum in the history of our country adding link to link to the chain which binds in one common bond the varied interests of this great confederacy giving fresh impulses to the enterprise of the capitalist, the speculations of the Merchant, and the industry of the Agriculturist—In adverting to these improvements the necessity of a further appropriation being made to complete inland navigation from St: Marys to St Johns River, presses with irresistable force on the minds of all capable of appreciating its advantages; the Steam Boat now running between Savannah and St: Johns river being under the necessity of passing from the Bar of St Marys to that of the St: Johns by Sea in consequence of the obstacle adverted to—The opening of a water communication from the cities of Charleston and Savannah by the St: Johns six mile creek and the Matanzas river to Cape Florida Key West and the Spanish and British possessions would prove it is believed to the commercial interests of this union a blessing more widely felt than the influence of that great canal the fame of which has covered the remains of its great projector with imperishable honor;” To effect this great object a distance of twenty three miles only at intermediate points require to be cut. The Grand Jury having learnt that the proprietor of the Steam Boat Florida now running as a Packet between Picolata on the river St: Johns and the city of Savannah, touching at all the intermediate places are anxiously to procure the contract for carrying the mail of the United States from Savannah to this City, and being apprised that much additional speed would thereby be given to the conveyance of the mail by means of such Steam Boat, the mail being brought to this place at least two days sooner than it now is, and having also understood that the proprietors of the said Boat will the event of their procuring the carriage of the mail continue the trips of the said Boat during the whole year, thereby causing, as it naturally must, much travelling, to and from this city, and finally as the Grand Jury think tending directly to the establishment of the main travelling route through this country from the north to new orleans. They therefore think that every aid should be given to that enterprising company as a means of accelerating the conveyance of the mail, and as a step in the promotion of so important an object. And they further present that the repairs of Fort Marion, and the continuation of the Sea Wall of the city of St: Augustine has heretofore been repeatedly urged *—The importance of completing a Barrier to protect this ancient city from the inroads of the Ocean, cannot be overlooked; and we rely on the exertions of our Delegate to obtain from Congress that aid which alone can save our city, when visited by storms, from unundation and ruin- They further present, that the United States Bridge across St: Sabastian Bridge Creek, and the causeways, leading thereto, are in an incomplete state, and they indulge in the hope that congress will make further appropriation for the completion of this work, and pass some needful law for its permanent preservation—as also that the road from Matanzas to New Smyrna is impassable for a horse, and that the mail has to be carried for a distance of thirty miles on foot, the Bridges and Flats having been burnt by the Indians setting fire to the Marshes; and recommend the erection of a Bridge across Tomoka Creek, as being more convenient and less liable to accident, than the Flat formerly kept at that Ferry. The Grand Jury further present, as an evil requiring the attention of the Government, the present neglected and unexplored state of that portion of this Peninsula lying South of the 29th degree of Latitude, which, while it forms in all probability the most valuable division of the Territory, has become a source of injury to its best interests, by affording a refuge for runaway slaves, and for bands of Indians of bad character, who are there beyond the reach of civil prosecution, and the control of the Agents of the Government. We consider as a circumstance operating greatly to the disadvantage of East Florida, that the resources of so large a division of its Territory comprising a soil and climate, which, (from information obtained through casual explorers and other indirect channels) are in the highest degree valuable, are suffered to remain undeveloped and unexamined, while it forms an obvious opprobrium to the General Government, that so extensive a portion of its domain, lying in the immediate vicinity of the Atlantic States, and forming the most 82 7" E R R H TO RIA L P A P E R S. exposed frontier of the Union, should be allowed to continue in this obscure and neglected condition— It is believed that valuable stores of Live Oak and other Naval materials exist in this region; which are daily abducted or destroyed without the Knowledge of the Government; and that the Revenue Laws are often contravened or evaded by the facility offered for smuggling and other infractions of the Regulations of the Government in this remote and unguarded portion of our Maritime Frontier. They therefore respectfully recommend that the proper authorities of the Territory proceed without delay to bring this important subject to the particular notice of the General Government, who, it is most anxiously expected, may be induced to order a Military expedition to be fitted out for the purpose of examining into, and completing the Geography of this interesting portion of East Florida, Further that three citizens of suitable information, and residents of this Territory shall accompany said expedition, for the purpose of acquiring a full knowledge of the Agricultural resources of that country. The Grand Jury concur with the Sentiments set forth in the presentments of the Grand Jurors of Duval county generally, and particularly as relates to the Salaries of the Judges of the Superior Courts of this Territory, as being inadequate to the high laborious and responsible duties which they are required to perform, and also regret to learn that the additional sum of eight hundred dollars allowed to the Judge of this District for his extra services in the Settlement of Land claims is still withheld from him *— Superior Court East Florida Clerk’s Office ST.

<docbody>TO GENERAL, WILEY THOMPSON, Seminole Agency, Florida. SIR, I have received your letters of the 2nd ins** with one from the Interpreter, Richards. I transmit a copy of the Treaties with the Appalachicolas,” and ask your attention to their provisions. You will perceive that these treaties present three alternatives to the Indians. 1. If under the 2nd article they remain upon their reservations, the United States will withdraw their protection, as soon as the Seminoles and Blunts band have emigrated. During this period, the United States will pay to them their proportion of the annuity of 5000$, secured by the treaty of Camp Moultrie, and the balance of this annuity for its unexpired term, when this period is closed. 2. If they sell their lands under the 2nd Article and remove to Arkansa, at any time prior to the completion of the removal of the Seminoles, them they must pay, from their private resources, all the expenses of their migration and subsistence. 3. If under the 2nd Article they surrender within the same period, their reservations to the United States and join the Creeks and Seminoles, in Arkansa and give up the treaty made with themselves, the United States will pay them Three thousand dollars for the reservation granted by the 2nd Article, and extend to them all the beneficial provisions of the treaty of Payne's Landing, a copy of which is enclosed. These three propositions of the treaties are distinct and intelligible, and the Department cannot vary them. If they follow Blunt to Texas, then the United States will be bound by the first proposition, to pay the annuity as there stated, and nothing more. No provision is made by the treaty, for a surrender to the United States and a union with Blunt in Texas. If they surrender to the United States, and join the Seminoles in Arkansa and relinquish the treaty made with themselves, then the 3rd proposition as above Stated, will be binding upon the United States and upon them. You are requested to explain these treaties to the Indians, that they may understand all that it is in the power of the Government to do for them. I am &amp;c., ELBERT HERRING. </docbody>

<docbody>SIR I have just returned from an excursion through the Seminole Nation to the Military Post at Tampa Bay, whither I went for the purpose of consulting with Maj. Zantzinger” the Officer in Command there, as to the measures (in cooperation with the Post at Fort King and this Agency) necessary to effect the objects of the Government— Having determined by the aid of the Military, to restrain the Indians from passing without their boundary, as far as practicable; and there having been but one trading house in the Nation; and that located near the Northern boundary of the Nation, it was due to the southern section of the Nation to afford them an opportunity to obtain conveniently, supplies of provisions and goods suited to their wants. To effect this object, and remove a plausible pretext for those Indians passing without their boundary I Licenced William G. Sanders of Tampa, to locate a Trading house at the Bridge across the big Hillsborough river, on the public road leading from Fort King to Tampa; and took his Bond in terms of the late Act of Congress reorganizing the Indian Department. I inclose to you a copy of a letter of this date addressed by me to the Governor of Florida, for the purpose of suggesting the propriety of resistance by the Action of Congress, to the extension of Territorial Jurisdiction over this Nation, should an Act of the Legislative Council, to that effect, be unfortunately consumated.

<enclbody>HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN HEATON (Confidential) SIR. It has been suggested to me that an attempt (perhaps a determined effort) will be made during the pending Session of the Legislative Council of Florida, to subject the Seminole Indians to the jurisdiction of the Territory. It is confidently believed that the object is the accomplishment of a fraud on these Indians. There are many likely Negros now in the possession of these people, to a considerable portion of which, there are conflicting claims. Some of these claims are hopeless, unless the Indian laws and Indian testimony can be repelled. If the jurisdiction of the Territory should be extended over the Indian Country; and the contest waged in the Territorial Courts, the object in view will be effected. Hence the effort (should it be made) to subject these people to Territorial jurisdiction. Your Excellency knows that the laws of Congress, and the regulations of the War Department predicated upon those laws, requires a submission of all claims against Indians to their resident Agent; and by him to be reported to that Department. The claims I allude to are with held— it is believed—for the purpose of accomplishing by the aid of the Territorial jurisdiction, what the claimants who are sensible of the injustice of their claims, cannot hope to effect, by a submission of their claims to a fair—to the regular &amp; legal test. You are apprised, no doubt, of the extremely delicate state of our present relations with these people— If the interposition which I thus deprecate, should be attempted, it NA(OIA, Lets.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to enclose you a copy of a Communication from M* Levy of date the 15" inst, to the contents of which, I beg your particular attention; You will observe that he claims, by decree of the of the Supreme Court, 20.000 acres of land within the Arredondo Grant, which has been Surveyed in Conformity with the decree of Said Court, and regularly returned to the proper Department—How far I may be authorised to interfere with the Survey already executed without instructions from the Treasury and a copy of the decree by him alluded to, does not admit of much doubt on my part. The other Case refered to, ineludes involves a difficulty of much importance and under which many cases will probably arise, and from the best reflection I can give it will have its remedy alone by Congressional provision. One other case of M* Levy's at what is called the “Water Pen” not mentioned in his letter but which has been the Subject of Correspondence between us, I hope will be arranged at last without much difficulty. He has promised to identify the beginning as Contemplated by the Grant, and as that instrument has not given any Calls either of Courses and distances, and as the Survey which was made, violated the provisions of said grant, in its only point of locality to wit: its Commencement, He has proposed to take the quantity by the lines of the public Surveys already made, thereby obviating any connectional fractions or other Survey, except a small subdivision. I have instructed the surveyor Accordingly, and hope the arrangement will be intirely satisfactory throughout. I shall be pleased to receive your views on these Subjects, as soon as the pressure of business will permit. We have been without any mails from Washington for some time [MS. torn] ing as is said to a new mail arrangement. I have the honor to be Very Respectfully Y" M* Ob st ROBERT BUTLER E HAYWARD Esq.r Com' Gen L" Office [Addressed] Honb' E.

<docbody>SIR Agreeably to your directions I make the following “detailed report” on the works of improvement entrusted to my charge in this part of the Territory of Florida– My first duties were on the improvement of Apalachicola river for which there was $8.000.00 appropriated in 1831.” This work was carried on during that year, by clearing the river of logs &amp; rafts that had lodged in it, and the banks of heavy timber where it was liable soon to fall in and afford new obstructions to the Navigation.—In the Summer of 1832 this part of the improvement was brought to a close and in the following Session of Congress, by a Survey &amp; Estimate of mine, an appropriation of $7.500 was made for a new &amp; Straight channel from St. Georges Sound to the town of Apalachicola.” This improvement was to Save a circuitous route of about six miles from the Sound to the town by a Straight cut of about 1% miles, and also to acquire a greater debth of water than was there had. The work was carried on in 1833 &amp; 1834 by a dredge boat and has been attended with the greatest success, so that a full rigged Ship passed up to town through it, within a week after it was completed. These works thus far have been attended with useful results, with which I am well satisfied—There is a small balance unexpended of these appropriations still in my hands— At the commencement of the year 1832 I was directed by you to take charge of the improvement of the St. Marks river &amp; harbour,” at which time the work in the harbour had been commenced with a dredge boat &amp; apparatus to deepen &amp; Straighten the channel. The space of the harbour that required this improvement was about two miles: intercepted with oyster bars and mud Shoals. The only difficult place of this work was in cutting through an oyster bar at the Devils Elbow, where a Stratum of rotten limestone was found but seven feet below water level at high tide. The plan adopted to deepen the channel through this cut of about 100 yards in length was to blast the stone by means of canisters of powder with tubes to come out of water which were adjusted in holes drilled for the purpose. This operation broke up the bed of Stone so completely that now with a diving bell it is easily removed out of the way.—The improvements on the river consist in cutting a canal through the Natural Bridge at Rockhaven, which was about 600 yards of Canaling, and to open the river &amp; swamp for scow naviagtion for about 14 miles above the Nat. Bridge to a point near Col Gadsdens plantation or about two miles South of the St. Augustine road. This improvement has been in progress since the fall of 1833 when the water has been low enough to carry in on. There now remains but a few weeks work with a small force of 10 or 15 hands to complete it as far as it is deemed practicable to expend money upon it. The funds available for the river &amp; harbour when I first took charge of the work 1" Jany 1832 was $10.734.80 and there have been appropriated at different times since by Congress for the same $10.600.00 There remains now unexpended of these funds but about $1200. which will complete the work in about Six weeks unless the water should rise to prevent any farther work on the river, in which case there would be a few hundred dollars that could be put in the hands of some agent here to expend the following year to finish it. In 1833 an appropriation of $5000 was made for the Ocklockney river which was placed in my hands for the purpose of its improvement." A force of hands was placed on that river in the Summer of the year of the appropriation to clear the Channel of logs, snags &amp; rafts. This force commenced work at the mouth of the river &amp; worked upwards—effectually removing the obstructions, till they reached Memsons Mills one mile below the bridge on the road from Tallahassee to Quincy; when the funds were exhausted and the work was stopped for the want of a further appropriation. Distance of the river improved about 130 miles— Independent of the above works, I have gratuitously made a Survey of the St. Andrews Bay Canal, Mouth of the Aucilla R. Little R. Originally for the Apalachicola harbour, &amp; again for its extended improvement &amp; the Chattahoochie R. &amp; Still more recently with a party of Maj. McNeill's "brigade for the eastern pass of the harbour, besides aiding principally to get up the Railroad to connect this place with St. Marks. You will see by the foregoing that my duties here will Soon expire and I shall be waiting orders, which I wish for in anticipation to remove from this place."

<docbody>SIR, In reply to your letter of this morning,” I have the honor to state, that the case of Colin Mitchell and others vs. The United States, is the only one arising under the act “for the settlement of private land claims in Florida,” approved May 23" 1828,” now remaining undisposed of and on the Dockett of the present Supreme Court for the present Term. The aid of the Surviving assistant counsel, General Call, will be essential in the argument of this case, and also in the discussion of other cases, if any, arising under the Act. I am, however not now able to inform you, whether any other cases, may be expected to arise, or not; nor whether the services of the law Agent will be requisite during the present year. Nor can I express any well grounded opinion as to the necessity of the whole appropriation asked for the compensation of the present year, but I am inclined to think that the whole will not be needed.” I am, Sir, very respectfully, your Ob' Serv" B.

<enclbody>Extract of a letter from Gen D L Clinch to Col Jos M. White “But the most important point, to the people of E Florida and the one that has been most grossly neglected is Bellamys Old road, leading from Alachua Court House, to Picolata Ferry on the St Johns. From St Augustine to Picolata is 18 miles and from Picolata to Alachien Court 55 miles, making seventy three miles from Alachien Court to St Augustine. In fact, this is the only point, to start from, in opening a communication with the Lawrence river, as the Steam Boat Company have already gone to much expense, in erecting a good house, &amp;c at Picolata, and it must in time be the great thoroughfare, for the trade of Alachua County, and the people of that county, are begining to take a deep interest in the road, and I have been informed that they were about to get up a memorial to you for an appropriation to repair Belamys old road, from the Courthouse to Picolata. I will however respectfully suggest and urge on you the importance of getting about $5000 appropriated to repair Belamys Old road from Picolata to Alachien Court house.”” </enclbody></enclosure></docbody>

<docbody>Sir/ I wrote to you a few days since via St Augustine,” but as the letter may not reach you as soon as by the regular mail route, I have thought it proper to write to you again, on a subject which formed part of my last communication. In that communication, I stated, that if it was the intention of the Government to remove the Seminole Indians west in the Spring, with or without their consent, that it would be necessary in my opinion, to send four additional companies to this Post, &amp; two to Fort Brooke, &amp; two Six pounders to each Post— The more I see of this Tribe of Indians, the more fully am I convinced that they have not the least intention of fulfilling their treaty stipulations, unless compelled to do so by a stronger force than mere words— Their minds have been so completely perverted, by a set of interested, &amp; designing men, that no argument or reasoning will have the least influence with them, except the argument of force—&amp; if a sufficient military force, to overawe them, is not sent into the Nation, they will not be removed, &amp; the whole frontier may be laid waste by a combination of the Indians, Indian negroes, &amp; the Negroes on the plantations—It is useless to mince this question; it should be met &amp; met firmly, if their treaty is to be carried into effect, —&amp; I do not hesitate to state, &amp; I do so from some small knowledge of the Indian Character, that a large majority of this Nation have not the most distant idea of going west, &amp; that they will not do so, unless compelled by a strong military force—I have therefore felt it my duty to make known to the General-in-Chief my views on this subject, &amp; to call for a sufficient Military force, completely equipped for active field service, (&amp; not with 13 rounds of cartridges priman) so as to enable me to assume any attitude that the Government may think proper to order me to take, in relation to this wilfully deluded Tribe”—It is to be regretted that Captain John Page of the 4* Inftry had not been sent to this Nation; as his long acquaintance with most of their principal men, &amp; thorough knowledge of their character, would have given him great influence with them—The Character of General Thompson is too well known at Washington, to require any commendation from me—but I feel it due to him, under the existing state of things in this section of country, to state, that as far as I have been able to form an opinion, I consider him an intelligent, honest, firm, &amp; faithful Agent of the Government; but he can do nothing unless sustained by a strong military force *— I am with high respect Your most obt D.

<docbody>SIR I have rec" your letter concerning the mode of paying off the members of the Council.” I regret the conclusions you have arrived at, as to the mode, &amp; hope you will, the reasons being placed before you, be disposed to change it. The mode heretofore pursued, was for the Governor to give to each member a certificate of the pay due to him, which was of par value or less than par, according to the speculative whims of the fraternity of brokers; and then, those certificates found their way to Washington where they have been always paid at irregular periods, thereby giving increased trouble to those who had to settle the accounts there. To avoid inconvenience, then, both to you, &amp; to myself; &amp; to avoid loss &amp; trouble to the members, a pay roll, showing what each member could claim for pay &amp; mileage and contained upon a single sheet, was filed with the Union Bank at this place, which agreed to advance the pay as called for, I giving a draft for the amount at the close of the Session.” Now at the moment when the Session is about to end (day after tomorrow) your letter informs me that a draft will be given by you on Mobile or New Orleans, if the Receiver Gen Call cannot pay it. Gen'Call is not here, he has gone to Washington. Under this view I hope the draft to be made, now, will be paid by you." Hereafter by your directions Gen'Call can make his Deposit in “the Union Bank of Florida” at this place, and then thro it, the payments can be made, which the acts of Congress authorise. The draft I made will be accompanied by the Pay roll, so that the charge, &amp; credit may both at once be entered on the books of your Department The particular features of the case as shown are such as to induce a hope, that you will not cause to be protested the Bill, which now, is unavoidable to be drawn, under the previous arrangements which I have made with the Union Bank. As the law does not inhibit it, I hope your regulations made at the Department will not." With great respect J. H. EATON LEVI WOODBURY Esq." Se" of the Treas” [Addressed] Levi Woodburry Esq."

<docbody>HON* LEVY WOODBERRY Sec of the Treasury SIR In reply to the enquiries contained in your letter of the 7" instant," received by this evenings mail, I pray leave to refer you to a copy of the Charter of this Institution, herewith enclosed." You will there see the principles upon which the Bank is founded; &amp; by which it must be governed.” Its Capital Stock is not subscribed in the ordinary way; but the individual Subscriptions are secured by bond of the parties, and mortgage upon property of ascertained value. Its operating, or monied Capital, is raised by a Sale of the bonds of the Territory of Florida, made payable to, (and yet payable by) the Bank I have marked the Sections of the Charter, which develope its principles. Of the Territorial bonds described in Section 10, Sales has been made to the Amount of half a million of dollars—Of which the amount of Three hundred &amp; sixty thousand dollars, have been delivered, &amp; Payment received. The remaining One hundred and forty thousand dollars in bonds, were forwarded to New York last week; and will be paid for, upon their receipt there. The Contractors for the purchase of the above half Million, have the Option of taking another half million at an encreased rate of premium—the Option to be declared on or before the 1* July next.— And the Bank is pledged that bonds, exceeding the amount of One Million of dollars, shall not be offered for sale prior to 1* June 1839. The Capital of the Bank therefore is $1.000.000 Of which there has been paid in $ .360.000 And in a few days the Amount paid in will be $ 500.000. Should the Contractors decline taking the Second half Million of bonds, they will be sold to other parties. No refusal, however, is anticipated. The Union Bank commenced its operations on the 16" Ultimo. The enclosed, is a Statement of its affairs, exhibited at the last meeting of the Board of Directors on the 18" instant. When it had been one month &amp; two days in operation. The Shares in the Capital Stock of the Bank, are of One hundred dollars each—And you will receive herewith a list of the Stockholders. I am not aware that any further explanations are necessary but if suggested, they will be promptly given. I remain Very respectfully Your Ob Servt JOHN G GAMBLE Prest.

<docbody>LIEUT: F. L. DANCEY, Acting Asst: Quarter Master, Fort King, Florida. SIR, An appropriation of ten thousand dollars" has been made by Congress for clearing out the Ocklawaha river from the Saint John’s to Glassell's Spring near Camp King." You are charged with the superintendence of the work; and you will take immediate measures to cause it to be executed. You will consult General D. L. Clinch as to the propriety of performing the work by hired laborers or by details from the troops—if the General should think proper to cause the troops to be employed you will provide whatsoever may be necessary to facilitate their operations. You will report to me from time to time the progress which you make, and whether you complete the work or not during the present season, you will make me a detailed report of the work performed, and the actual condition of the improvements in time for my annual report. I have this day required for you the sum of Two thousand dollars on account of the special appropriation for the work—You will keep the accounts for this work separate from you accounts for the Quarter Master's Department, and should you find it convenient to use tools, or means of transportation, or supplies of the Quarter Master's Department, you will cause them to be valued, and regularly transfer them to the work. The list of articles, with the value, properly certified must accompany your property accounts. Further remittances will be made on your estimates.”— </docbody>

<docbody>DEAR SIR I recv" your letter,” showing the different appropriations which stand to the credit of this Territory. I thank you for the information, for indeed so loosely have the records of this office been heretofore kept, that nothing could be obtained from them. There are outstanding claims against those appropriations, that ought to be paid; but I am not willing to be making drafts by piecemeal on the secretary. Nor do I see the use of any such course. Will you see M* Woodbury upon this subject and ask if he will not remit to me warrants, on Mobile, or New Orleans, for the whole of the several appropriations standing to the credit of this Territory, so that the people here, entitled to receive it, may be paid by the Union Bank from time to time, as their claims are ascertained. It is the simplest and best mode, of disbursing the money. It will be less troublesome to him, and to myself. Or may I make out a draft upon him payable at Washington, or N York in favor of the Bank here, and then thro it, make the disbursements, as they may from time to time be needed Please ask him also, if I may draw upon him for my own salary. That I do not want here; but to be permitted to make a draft on him for the amount, after the 30" March, when 3 quarters will be due to me. Please answer me early respectfully yours J. H. EATON Ask Mr. Woodbury also, if Mr. Walker shall draw as secretary for his salary, or will the approprtn for that purpose be transferred to the Bank here also— [Addressed] Majr. T. L.

<docbody>SIR Your letter of the 23" ult.” informing me of the decision of the commanding Gen' in relation to my going with M.

The bell has proved a powerful engine to tear up the rock from the bed &amp; removing it— Rocks of two tons weight have been removed with greater facility than they could have been taken from a dry quarry, on account of the Buoyancy of the bell when sunk with the power of the wheel &amp; axle &amp; pulleys connected with it.—Experience has confirmed me in the opinion I have expressed in my communication of the plan of the bell to you, of the utility of this machine for the purposes there stated.— The improvement of the river has been completed as far as was the first plan of it. A boat has this Season made several successful trips on it. More might be done to advantage in deepening some parts of the channel; but the funds having been exhausted, I have this day brought this work to a close. The public property used on these works has been stored in Magnolia with the purpose of selling at Auction all but the Bellboat &amp; Bell. I have been informed that an appropriation has been made for the improvement of the Chipola river; *—There is three or four miles of this river through a cypress swamp where there is deep water through a thick growth of large trees, which I am acquainted with from personal examination. These trees ought to be cut at least three feet under water, and I think by cutting the trees down at the waters surface &amp; then sinking the bell over the stumps that a ready means will be had to accomplish the work of cutting the stumps out of the way—On this account I shall make no further disposition of this Machine till instructed by you. I shall close my accounts of the works I have had under my charge and be ready for orders as soon as I can receive them." I remain Respectfully Your Obt Servt GEO W.

I feel it my duty to suggest to the Department, that in any future movement of Troops, for this Section of Country, from any point on the Sea Board; that they be ordered via the mouth of the St. Johns River, thence up the river to Palatka on the West Bank of the St. Johns about 100 miles from its mouth, and 70 miles by the waggon road to this Post. (any vessel that can cross the Bar at the mouth of the river can ascend to Palatka,) The Asst. Q Master at this post, with a short previous notice, could have transportation in readiness at Palatka for this Post. There would be much saving of both time and expence by this movement. I am respectfully Your obt Servant F. L. DANCY Lt. &amp; a.a. Q Master. The distance across the country from St. Augustine to Palatka is but 30 miles, but for 10 miles of the distance there is no waggon road— and at high water or of a wet season, it is impossible to pass the road even on horse Back without swimming one or two creeks. and from St. Augustine via Jacksonville to this place is 150 miles—over a very heavy road. The most expeditious route for troops from St. Augustine to this post is to march across the country over a pretty good road a distance of 18 miles to Picolata, and there take the steam Boat to Palatka a distance of 30 miles. where they could take a good waggon road to this place a distance of 70 miles.

Considering that General Call has attended the Supreme Court of the United States three several Terms, including the present Term, exclusively for the arguing the case of Mitchel, for two of which Terms he has as yet received no compensation, except an allowance for travelling and contingent expenses, and that the case Forbes &amp;" west of the Apalachacola was not brought before the Supreme Court by appeal I am of the opinion that besides the usual allowances for travelling expenses for the present Term, General Call ought to receive the further sum of One Thousand Dollars in full for his services in the case of Mitchell The amount allowed him for those services will then be $1500 besides traveling expenses,” which added to the fee paid him in Arrendos case will in truth be $500 less than he ought have reasonably expected to receive for his services in the Supreme Court in the three causes when he entered into his engagement with the United States to argue those case.” All of which is respectfully submitted. </docbody>

<docbody>T. L. SMITH Esq." Register of the Treasury SIR, In reply to the suggestion in Governor Eaton's letter, of the 2" inst,” referred by you to this Department, I am happy to submit the following remarks.— 1. In respect to any outstanding appropriations in favor of the Territory of Florida or for public expenditures within it the Department is ready to pay them to the proper officers at any moment when it is shewn by him that the money is needed or has been expended properly. The usual course and forms will it is hoped create no delay or inconvenience—and the money when required in pursuance of them will be paid at Mobile, New Orleans, or any other point more desirable. The system of paying on drafts was abolished, in almost every instance, the first year of General Jackson's administration: and is never resorted to now—except to save the credit of the Government, and when the draft has been drawn under a mistake as to the present usage. 2"—In respect to the salaries of all the officers in the territory—they can receive their pay of Gen: Call, the Receiver of public money, under a late Circular, or can have warrants for them on Mobile, or any other Bank more convenient— at the end of each quarter—according to another Circular issued last autumn. This Department will use every effort to make prompt early and convenient payments to all public officers and creditors— though it will not be practicable to do it, except in such a way and in pursuance of such forms as are established for the safe and uniform disbursement of public money"— Yours respectfully, L. W-Secy of the Treas" </docbody>

<docbody>SEMINOLE INDIANS, Treaty with them SIR, In your letter of the 21* instant," after enclosing to me a communication of Governor Eaton,” in which he suggests doubts concerning the validity of the Treaty with the Seminole Indians, concluded on the 9" of May 1832,” and ratified on the 9th of April 1834, in consequence of the delay which took place in the ratification; you requested my opinion upon the validity of the Treaty, and upon the right of the United States to remove these Indians in the years 1835, 1836, and 1837. There is certainly great force in the suggestions made by Governor Eaton; and as the Government, in its relations and intercourse with the Indians, is necessarily &amp; obliged to become, for all practical purposes, its own interpreter and judge, it is under the highest obligation to make no claim under the treaty, and to set up no construction of its terms, which are not fairly authorized by its sense and spirit. And if it can be shown, that a material change of circumstances connected with the question of removal, had actually occurred, during the period which elapsed between the signing and ratifycation of the Treaty, then it is plain, that the Indians can no longer be held to it; unless by some act since its ratification, they have recognized and affirmed its validity. In the present case, as no time was limited for the ratification of the Treaty; as the supplemental articles of the 28" of March 1833,” treated it as yet in existence, although not then ratified by the President and Senate; and as no material change of curcumstances is suggested, I think it must be deemed a valid and subsisting treaty. If the Treaty be valid, the particular intent to remove in 1833, 1834, and 1835, must yield to the general engagement to remove in three years from the ratification; and the same provision must be made for the unforeseen case which has now arisen, which was expressly made for the case actually anticipated. It was evidently the understanding and design of the parties, that the removal should commence with the year following the ratification, and that the tribes should be removed in about equal proportions during that and the two following years. Consequently they are now to be removed in the years 1835, 1836, and 1837.” I have the honor to be very respectfully your Ob" Serv" B. F. BUTLER THE HONORABLE LEWIS CASS Secretary of War The papers are herewith returned. </docbody>

<docbody>TO BREVET BRIGD GEN" D. L. CLINCH Fort King, Florida. SIR, Governor Eaton has transmitted to the Department the copy of a letter which he has written to you on the Subject of the removal of the Seminole Indians from Florida.” The doubts Suggested by Gov. Eaton in that letter, and in one addressed by him to this Department * concerning the validity of the Treaty ratified with the Seminoles in April 1834,” in consequence of two of the years during which they were to remove having expired, have been considered by the President. On a full examination, however, of the Subject the obligation of the Treaty does not Seem to be affected by this circumstance, as the postponement of the ratification was occasioned by a Stipulation in the Treaty requiring an examination of the western Country, and the Subsequent assent of the Seminoles before the Treaty could take effect. The ratification was given as soon after this was effected as practicable. You will therefore proceed under your original instructions. If any delay, however, has occurred in consequence of this enterposition of Gov. Eaton, your conduct in postponing the Subject will be entirely approved. Let me however add that in the execution of the task committed to you I am very desirous that no harsh measures Should be used which can possibly be avoided. It is only in the last resort, and under the conviction that the peace of that part of the Country re- quires the immediate removal of these Indians that the measures directed Should be resorted to.” LEW: CASS </docbody>

<docbody>SIR. Your letter of 1" current * has been received, and the returns sent back placed under examination for correction, and will be again forwarded in a few days—The amount of 5000$ requested to be sent me, has been receiv" and disbursed to Me" Washington &amp; M"Cormick Depy Sur" leaving a small ballance still due the latter—Three other Deputies have arrived and the fourth expected hourly—M" Washington gone some days to complete his contract—I have the honor to request your attention to the Diagram forwarded you last year shewing the relative position occupied by these Surveyors respectively, and to remark thereon that the Indian boundary contrary to all expectation and information received was found to be near the South boundary of Towns 13 extending East &amp; west from into Ranges 19 &amp; 24 widening as going South into the 26 Range on the East and embracing nearly all of 19 on the West—To guard against such a possibility I had instructed the Surveyors to extend South on the East &amp; West of said boundary, which has been accordingly done— Lake George &amp; St Johns River both are found to be something East of the Diagram representation. To effect the Object of this Office however the Mess" Clements obtained permission to run the Paralel through the Nation, and effected that object thereby attaining, the correct data to extend the Surveys South as instructed, but the Surveys above could not be connected to the Paralel within the limits of the Indian boundary, but have been (without the same) both E. &amp; West. As soon as practicable after the arrival of M" Kerr, I shall have a rough draft made out and forwarded for your satisfaction explanatory of the facts here communicated. In drawing your attention now to these facts, I advise you that on the East between the Indians and the Atlantic, below where the Surveys are now extended, the Country is represented to be for some distance a wet Savannah generally impassable except in boats, save a narrow strip near the Margin of the Atlantic; and again on the West not more than two Townships wide from the Marsh of the Gulf to the Indian boundary aforesaid until we near the Bay of Tampa. I would suggest for your consideration, whether it would not be important and desirable to suspend the public Surveys in that quarter until the Indians shall have been removed agreeably to the stipulations of the 7" Article of the Treaty with the Seminoles at Camp Paynes landing on the 9" day of May 1832." to enable the extension of the future Surveys regularly on the whole line of the new paralel and taking also into view the quantity of work now &amp; to be received in the Office under the Contracts forwarded last year and that of M Washington a few weeks since and remarking upon their complex character from the great number of private claims in some of them, rendering the duties of this Office extremely onerous—Under all the circumstances I feel constrained to say, that I can but hope, that if any amount of work shall be ordered by you, it will be limited in its quantity, and with these views I submit the subject for your instructions desiring that I may be advised thereof as early as practicable to enable me to give the necessary notice and instructions and have the contracts executed in due time to commence this fall at as early a period as safety to my Deputies will justify their movement— I have the honor to be very respectfully Yr Mo Ob St ROBERT BUTLER E.

<docbody>SIR; The enclosed copies of a communication made direct to the Hon: Sec of War,” &amp; of a paper signed by a majority of the principal &amp; Sub-Chiefs of the Seminole Nation,” will inform the general-inchief, of the measures that have been adopted in relation to the removal of that Nation to the West—The greatest exertions have been made, &amp; the strongest arguments urged by General Thompson &amp; myself, to induce these people to comply with their treaty stipulation, &amp; to remove to their new homes, without being forced at the point of the bayonet—They were told at last that their great Father, the President, had told them that they must comply with their treaty &amp; go to their new homes; that it was his wish that they should go quietly &amp; peaceably; that he had caused every arrangement to be made for their comfort &amp; convenience on the journey; but that he had also given me the means, if they would not comply with their solemn treaty, to compel them; and that I would do it—The fact is, the appropriation for their removal was made so late, that the agent of the government could not have made the necessary arrangements for their removal, before the hot season set in, if the Indians had have been willing to commence removing at this time; but there was not one that would consent to an immediate removal—The arrangement made with them, was, under all the circumstances of the case, in my humble opinion, the best that could have been made; &amp; nothing but the strongest measures could have induced them to enter into it— I have strong hopes that if the same measures are continued, the whole Nation may yet be induced to move together by the 1" December; &amp; I hope the arrangement made, as above alluded to, will meet the approbation of the President, the Hon: Sec of War, &amp; of the Gen' in Chief—I have the honor further to state, for the information of the general-in-Chief, that I have made the following disposition of the Troops placed under my command—Bt Lt: Colonel Fanning, with four companies, will remain at this Post; &amp; during my temporary absence, will be left in command of the Troops in Florida—Bt Major Zantzinger with his three companies at present at Fort Brooke, will continue in command of that Post; &amp; is charged with the protection of that section of country, &amp; with keeping the Indians within their southern boundary—Bt Major Dade will remain at Key West, &amp; is directed to give protection to the settlements near Cape Florida, &amp; to order within their limits, all the Indians that may be found in that quarter—Captain Thruston " with his company, is ordered to take post about twelve miles northwest from this, &amp; near the boundary line, where there are comfortable quarters for himself &amp; command, &amp; is charged with keeping the Indians within their northwestern boundary, &amp; with giving protection to that section of country—Captain Drane is ordered to return with his company to Fort Marion, &amp; is directed to proceed as soon after his arrival at that Post as may be practicable as far South as Mosquito, or Indian rivers, where it is reported there are a large number of Indians, &amp; to compel them &amp; all others that he may find between those rivers &amp; a noted trading place on the St Johns river, called Volusia, to return within their limits; &amp; he is charged with the protection of the country east of the John’s river—The four companies left at this Post, will act as circumstances may require, &amp; can be made comfortable at very little or no expense to the government—Asst Surgeon Weightman will return with Company “D” 2"Artillery to Fort Marion; Asst Surgeon Archer * will remain at this Post; &amp; Asst Surgeon Clarke * will be ordered to accompany “C” Company 3” Artillery—After the 20th May I shall fix my Head Quarters at Fort Marion: &amp; shall avail myself of the indulgence granted me by the General-in-Chief, &amp; leave here to morrow for Mobile &amp; remove my family with the least possible delay to St Augustine—These arrangements I also hope, will meet the approbation of the General-in-Chief *—I cannot close this hasty communication without giving it as my decided opinion, that not a soldier should be ordered from Florida, until after the removal of the Indians, as the least move towards diminishing the present force would ruin every thing—I would also respectfully suggest the necessity of filling up all the companies in Florida by the 1* November— The recruits intended for the five companies here &amp; the company at Fort Marion, should be sent direct to the St Johns river &amp; landed at Picolata—When they could be marched to their respective posts— I remain with high respect Your most Obt D.

<docbody>SIR Gen Clinch left here on the 25th inst. for Mobile, He will be absent about two months. During his absence, the command of the Troops in E. Florida devolves on me. The General, before his departure, and in conjunction with Gen.' Thompson, the Indian Agent, effected an arrangement with at least one half of the Seminole Chiefs, by which they and their followers and their negroes are to leave Florida for their new homes on the 1* of December next, and there are strong reasons to believe that before that time all the discontented chiefs will come into the measures of the executive and depart with their brethren. I much fear that the harmony of this arrangement and the just expectations of the executive will be destroyed by the cupidity of our own citizens. Under an impression that the Indian negroes can be bought for little or nothing, speculators will shortly be flocking in the Country—The Negroes, who are bold, active and armed will sacrafice some of them to their rage. This is not all: they will quit the party of their owners who are disposed to emigrate and join the discontented chiefs who only want this encouragement to resist the mandates of the Government. Under the circumstances, Gen.' Thompson has particularly requested me to write and obtain, if possible, orders to turn back every white man who shall attempt to cross the Indian boundary, and whose business is not immediately with the troops or public agents here.” I have the honor to be, Sir, Yr M" Ob*S* A.

<docbody>TO GEN WILEY THOMPSON, Seminole Agency, Florida, SIR, I have received a letter, dated the 12th instant, signed by Stephen Richards, in behalf of John Yellow Hair." I have to request that you will state to the latter, that having signed the treaty made with Mulatto King on the 18th June 1833," he is to be considered a party to and bound by all its stipulations. The second article gave to Mulatto King and Tustenuggy Hajo “for the benefit of themselves, Sub-Chiefs and Warriors” three sections of land. These Sections they were authorized to sell, with the consent of the Executive of Florida. If they did sell them, they were to choose a country for themselves, and remove thither at their own expense. The 4th article provided that if they would dispose of their land to the United States, and emigrate to the Seminole Country West of the Mississippi, the United States would pay the expenses of their removal and subsistence, together with three thousand dollars for their reservation, By the 3rd article it was stipulated they should receive their proportion of the annuity of 5000$ while they remained, and their proportion of it for its unexpireded term, when the Seminoles completed their removal. When Yellow Hair, thro' you, signified his intention to emigrate with Blunt &amp; Davy, he was informed that he would not thereby entitled himself to the benefits of the treaty with them, but would still be bound by the above stipulations. His proportion therefore of the annuity for the last year was given to Capt Russell, and has this year been placed in the hands of Lieut. Harris. The three sections are granted to the two Chiefs jointly, and by the 4th article, the right of determining the manner in which they shall be disposed of is granted to “the chiefs &amp; warriors, parties to this agreement. This Department cannot adjust the amount of Yellow Hair's interest, nor enter into a separate arrangement with him for its relinquishment. If the land is sold under the 2nd article, and these Indians remove to any other place than the Seminole Country West, the United States have only to pay them annually their proportion of the annuity. But if they surrender their land to the United States, they they will be benefitted by the provisions of the 4th article. If Yellow Hair has sustained inconvenience and loss, in consequence of his removal with Blunt, he cannot ask the Department to 1" NA(OIA, Lets. Recd., Apalachicola). remunerate him, as he was told beforehand that the proceeding would not be Sanctioned. You will also say to the chiefs, that Yellow Hair has not lost his interest in their reservation by his removal, and prevent them from depriving him of any of the benefits provided for in the treaty.— Very &amp;c., LEWIS CASS THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO RICHARD C. </docbody>

The object will be to apply the appropriation to such parts of the road as most require repair or reconstruction, and if it should not be sufficient to complete the whole, to ask for whatsoever may be further necessary at the next session of Congress.

I have this day requested a remittance in your favor, for the service of the Department, of $1,500, on your estimate for the present Quarter. 14 Not found, but the entry in NA (WD, QMG Reg. of Lets.

Has consulted with General Clinch in relation to that work—who says it was impossible in the present state of affairs for any step to be taken in relation to it—but thinks it probable after the 20th inst. the preliminary preparations might be commenced—It cannot well be done during the Summer months in consequence of Sickness—&amp; the vast number of the Sand flies, Musquitoes &amp; other troublesome and annoying insects—Will endeavor to forward the work when commenced to the best advantage should the Troops be employedrequests they be allowed in addition to the 15 Cts allowed by law—15 Cts from the appropriation—as they will be subject to great labour, toil &amp; exposure and deprived of almost every comfort, Says, that if the Dept has not placed in other hands the appropriation for opening the Road from St Augustine via Picolata to Pensacola, or could it be divided, he could easily attend to that part from St Augustine for 100 miles distance.” </docbody>

<docbody>ROBERT BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida. SIR, Herewith you will receive a printed copy of the decisions made by the Supreme Court of the United States at their January term 1834, in eleven land cases in your Territory,” by which those claims have been confirmed, and I have to request that you cause those claims to be surveyed, in strict conformity to the decision in each case, with the least practicable delay. Where the lands confirmed by those decrees have been already surveyed as public lands, the lines of the claims when surveyed will have to be connected with the public surveys in such manner as to enable you to ascertain with accuracy the contents of the Sections which may be made fractional thereby. When, as in the case of the 20.000 acres confirmed to Moses E. Levy, within the bounds of the Arredondo grant, the survey is situated in whole, or in part, within the lines of a previously executed survey of a confirmed claim, you will in directing the survey of the tracts now confirmed, cause such accurate connections to be made between the lines of the two claims as may be necessary to show all the information which may be desireable respecting the nature and extent of the interference. I think it will be advisable, whenever you know the address of the parties interested in the cases, to notify them in writing as to the time when you propose causing the survey to be made, in order that they may have an opportunity of furnishing such information to the Deputy Surveyor, as they wish to place in his possession."

In making the repairs, you will be careful to complete, thoroughly, every part which you begin—no part will be partially done.

<docbody>SIR Your letter of instructions under date 22 Ultimo covering Eleven cases of Land Claims decreed by the Supreme Court at their January term 1834 has been received,” and I shall loose no time in preparing the necessary instructions under the decrees aforesaid preparatory to their execution, at the same time premising that the performance of this duty on the part of the deputy Surveyors who may be assigned thereto, will be greatly unprofitable if not a loosing business, being a highly responsible and vexatious duty arising out of the conflicting opinions of the claimants with the duties of these Officers and the detached nature and small extent of the work to be executed, yet in all respects requiring the expensive outfit in hands and equipage as that of an extensive contract. An imperious sense of duty, will alone induce its engagement by the Deputy Surveyors. The Season is now so far advanced as that it is deemed highly impolitic and hazardous to despatch Surveyors until the month of October shall have arrived, and this will afford the claimants sufficient time to have the necessary documents prepared to meet the action of the Surveyors without any delay in the execution of their labours, which is alone an important consideration taking into view the immense expense incurred by them under their most diligent sense of oeconomy and active movement; supplies of every description being so extremely high and scarce. From the cursory reading of the several decrees, I find it will be necessary for the claimants to furnish the decrees of the Court below together with the plats of Surveys therein recognized, and also copies of their grants &amp;c to enable the Surveyors to comply with the several mandates of the Court above. Will you have the goodness to direct two additional printed copies of the decrees aforesaid to be sent to me, as it is important that each Surveyor at least should be placed in possession of One. You suggest as proper that I should notify the claimants in writing as to the time I propose having the Surveys executed &amp;c. I desire that I may be permitted to publish a notice in the paper of this place making the necessary requirements of the claimants, &amp; one of each can be sent by mail to their address leaving no door of censure open or excuse on their part for inattention. The propriety of this step will I trust be readily seen by you, and I permitted to adopt it. In the mean time I shall prepare the notice and instructions and await your answer. Should the foregoing remarks suggest to your superior judgment any any additional instructions, I will be thankful for their transmission. I would particularly call your attention to the decree in favor of G JF Clarke for sixteen thousand acres which requires to be run out within the original Grant, wherein the Court remark (page 17) “But we do not think these irregular surveys affect the title under the Original grant, unless the lands have been acquired by others. The vacant lands within its bounds still belong to the Appellee, and may now be surveyed by him.” The Court then decree in favor of the survey by Don A Burgevin for 8000 acres and order the Court below to adjudge “that the residue of the said granted land be surveyed to the said petitioner within the limits of the grant” I ask the question; ought not the survey to be one and entire under the calls of the grant paying no regard to the survey of 8000 acres within it or must that be also surveyed; and in the event that part thereof (meaning the entire grant) shall have been acquired by others can I go without the limits of the Original grant for compliment or simply shew interference as heretofore? Are not all surveys decreed as valid and found fraudulent to be corrected? To enable me to secure the services of two Deputy Surveyors in the execution of the foregoing decrees I shall offer them the execution of some unfinished work on the West of Suwanee River which could not be executed at the time the surveys were in progression there owing to an extraordinary freshet in said River. I learn that there is some desirable land within the district unsurveyed. I have just seen a copy of the Decree in favor of Colin Mitchell and others made at last term of the Supreme Court * and from the complex nature of the boundaries including Islands together with what may be the final determination of the Court below as to what extent of domain will be awarded the United States at the Fortress of St Marks, I feel very solicitous that when you may instruct me to have that survey executed that the path of duty may be plainly marked out by the Authorities at Washington where every point of information and documents exist touching the subject. It appears by said decree that the several deeds of cession &amp;c filed or referred to in the record are to have their lines boundaries &amp;c all laid off by the Surveyor General Soliciting your earnest attention to this subject when it shall be brought before you I have the honor to be very respectfully Your Most Ob" Ser" ROBERT BUTLER To E HAYWARD Esq Comm Gen' of Land Office [Endorsed] Tallahassee, 10 June 1835 Robert Butler, S.

<place-time><month>June</month><date>10</date><year>1835</year></place-time>
<docbody>TO GENERAL CHARLES GRATIOT Chief Engineer U.S. SIR, In obedience to your orders of the 5" May *"I have caused a Survey to be made of Fort S*Marks and its vicinity at the junction of the St Marks and Waculla Rivers, and now enclose you a Map * of the same. The Law of Congress grants to the Tallahassee Rail Road Company “ten acres of land at the junction of the S*Marks and Waculla Rivers (the point where the Road terminates) exclusive of such portions as shall be actually improved by individuals and now in their occupancy, and also exclusive of such portions as, in the opinion of the President it may be expedient to reserve for the national defence or other public use.” " In laying off the reservation of the Site of the Fort I have adopted the line F’ F’’ F’’’ F’’’’ commencing at the Waculla river and following the walls and pickets of the Old Fort until they intersect the St Marks River. Exterior to this line and parallel to it I caused thirty feet to be laid off for a ditch. The line A.B. was then run at the distance of 100 feet and parallel to the ditch—this line is marked A.B. and forms together with the S" Marks &amp; Waculla Rivers the limits of the reserve for the U. States. Within this line several persons have occupancy. On the exterior of the line several portions of the land, actually held and improved by individuals are numbered from 1 to 25. The reservations for the U. States and for individuals occupy the whole of the land immediately at the junction of the S" Marks and Waculla Rivers, leaving exteriorly to it a marsh subject to the daily overflowing of the tide and is totally unfit for the purposes of a depot desired to be obtained by the Rail Road Company. For these reas [ons] and adopting what I believed to be the spirit of the law of Congress, I directed the location of the grant to the Company to be made in such a manner as the President &amp; directors should desire— accordingly the location indicated in the Map was selected by the President of the Company. I have furnished the President and Directors with a copy of this Map together with a letter informing them that when the sanction of the Secretary of War shall have been obtained the Grant will be finally confirmed. The interference of other more pressing duties rendered it necessary for me to employ an assistant in making the survey.” I have the honor to be, Sir, Very Respectfully Your Obt. Servt. Wm H.

<docbody>ROBERT BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida. SIR, In reply to your letter of the 10" inst: * I have to state that I do not perceive any objection to your giving the notice to the claimants under the decrees made by the Supreme Court in 1834, required by the letter of the 22" ult” * by publishing such notice for a few times in the newspaper at Tallahassee," taking such other measures as may be necessary to ensure the reception of such notice by the parties interested in those claims. In relation to the case of Clarke claiming 16.000 acres, I am of opinion that in the first case the tract of 8000 acres within the limits of the original grant as surveyed by Burgevin, and now confirmed by the Supreme Court, must be surveyed, and if the District Court has taken the further proceedings in the case required by the decree of the Supreme Court, then the residuary 8000 acres are also to be surveyed. In neither case, however, can you go without the limits of the original grant to get the specified area; and if there are other claims interfering with the original grant, then the nature and extent of such interferences must be ascertained and exhibited upon the plats. I hope that the surveys will be made as soon as practicable, and that you will have no difficulty in procuring competent surveyors, who have had large and profitable contracts to perform the present work although it may not be quite as lucrative a job as those they have heretofore executed.

<docbody>THE HON: LEVI WOODBURY, Sec'y of Trea'y. SIR: In relation to your reference to this office of the letter of the 9" Instant,”fromColin Mitchel respecting the survey of the lands confirmed to him and others, at the last Term of the Supreme Court of The United States,” I beg leave to remark that the opinion of the Court states that “the lands are in four separate tracts, extending from the Mouth of the S" Marks outside of the Islands along the Seacoast to the West end of S. Vincent's Island, West of the Mouth of the River Appalachicola; thence to that River about five miles from its Mouth, up the same for many miles; thence by a back line to a point on the Western Bank of the S" Marks, above the Old Fort of that name, and down the said River to the Sea.” It also states that “it is unnecessary to refer to the boundaries of the separate tracts, or the particular designation of the lines and points of the whole body of lands, as they are not a subject of controversy in this case.” The Decree confirms the claims of the Petitioners to all the lands within the limits of the first three described tracts, and also to the fourth tract, with the exception of the part thereof in the immediate neighborhood of, and including Fort S. Marks, which is directed to be reserved as the property and for the use of the United States, the extent and boundaries of which Reservation are to be ascertained and determined by the Superior Court of the Middle District of Florida, upon the principles laid down by the Supreme Court. The decree then orders and directs the Clerk of the Court to “certify the same to the Surveyor General of Florida, pursuant to law, with directions to survey and lay off the lands described in the petition of the Claimant, according to the lines, boundaries, and description thereof in the several deeds of cession, Grant, and Confirmation by the Indians or Governor of West Florida, filed as exhibits in this case, or referred to in the records thereof, excepting nevertheless such part of the tract granted in 1811, lying East of the tract granted in 1804 and 1806, as is hereby declared to be the Territory of The United States, pursuant to the exception herein before mentioned, and to make return thereof according to law as to all the lands comprehended in the three first herein mentioned tracts. And as to the tract last herein mentioned, to survey, and in like manner to lay off the same, so soon as the extent of the land herein excepted and reserved for the use of The United States shall be ascertained in the manner herein before directed.” In answer to an application made to the Clerk of the Supreme Court he has informed this office that he has made no communication to the Surveyor General respecting this decision of the Court, but he has sent to this Office a certified copy of the decree in the case. The Surveyor General in writing to this Office under date of the 10th Instant,” says, “I have just seen a copy of the Decree in favor of Colin Mitchel and others, made at the last Term of the Supreme Court, and from the complex nature of the boundaries, including Islands, together with what may be the final determination of the Court below as to what extent of domain will be awarded The United States at the Fortress of St Marks, I feel very solicitous that when you may instruct me to have that survey executed, that the path of duty may be plainly marked out by the authorities at Washington where every point of information and documents exist touching the subject. It appears by said decree that the several deeds of cession, &amp;c, filed or referred to in the record are to have their lines, boundaries, &amp;c, all laid off by the Surveyor General.” If instructions are now to be given by this Office to the Surveyor General, in relation to the execution of the surveys, I beg leave to request your directions upon the following points: 1* Are separate surveys to be made of each of the first three mentioned tracts, or are they all to be included in one survey? 2" Is the survey of the fourth tract to be delayed until the land, excepted from the confirmation in this case, and reserved for the use of The United States shall be ascertained in the manner pointed out in the decree; or shall the exterior lines of the claim be now surveyed, leaving the reserved tract at S* Marks to be surveyed whenever its extent and boundaries shall be determined by the Court below? If the surveys are now to be made, I propose furnishing the Surveyor General, with the printed Copy of the Record of the Court below, now in this Office, in which the boundaries of the particular tracts are described, and instructing him to have the surveys executed in strict conformity to the decree of the Supreme Court. The letter of M. Mitchel, with the accompanying printed copy of the opinion and decree of the Court, are herewith returned. With, &amp;c, JN° M. MOORE Acting Comm” </docbody>

<docbody>GENERAL, In compliance with the last par: of your letter of the 9th ult.” I have the honor to make the following report in relation to that part of the road between Tallahassee &amp; St Augustine. I have not pass'd over that road since Oct. 1833 at which time I made an examination of it to estimate to estimate the cost of the repairs then required; in the report accompanying that estimate a change is recommended in part of the route:” The route proposed is from Talla: follow the old Mil” road to Magees (56 miles) near Sampala Lake thence take the North (instead of the South) side of that Lake following a road partially cut out by M* Leavingston to a ferry lately established over the Suwanee a mile and a half below the junction of the Withlacoshee with that river (21 miles) thence a route marked out about three years ago direct (not by the Ross Springs) thro: Alagator Settlement to Roberts the site of Columbia County Court House (38 miles) and thence to cut a road to intersect the Alachua road at or near Ubanks (45 miles) and follow the Alachua road to Jacksonville (5 miles) thence the old Kings road to within six miles of St Augustine and thence the road now used to the latter place (39 miles) making a total distance of 204 miles; The amount estimated for was $10,900– and I presume it will require full more than that to accomplish the object at this time. The repairs required between Tallahassee and Magees the place of leaving the Mil” road are, the stumps to be cut out of the tract of the road, a Bridge to be made over a creek fourteen miles east of Talla: and one about two miles East of Ocilla river, and several low places to be causwayed in the whole distance; at the time of making the estimate I was urged to include in it the cost of a Bridge over the Ocilla but did not do it for the reason that it frequently overflows its banks to too great an extent to Bridge and were the river only to be bridged the ferry boat would most probably be layed aside and the travel would then be interupted at times by high water. Whereas by continuing the ferry the Boat can always be taken to the edge of the water high or low, from Magees to the Suwanee the road requires to be better cut out and straightened it passes over good ground &amp; requires but one small Bridge &amp; no causwaying: by refferance to Searcys map of Flo. it would appear to make very much of a crooke in the road to take it North of Sampala Lake, it is not the case however it makes much less of a bend than to go to the South of it, the lake is not correctly layed down on the map; from the Suwanee ferry to Roberts” which is situated directly north of Alagator Lake three miles. the road has been marked out and carts have travelled it and part of it has been partially cut out, it requires to be cut anew in part and straightened, there are no bridges required, about one and a half miles next west of Davis' place is low ground most of it will require to be thrown up from Rob- erts' there is a trail or road leading to Jacksonville which crosses Big Creek near its mouth, this trail should not be followed for besides making the distance full one third more it is not so good a route for a road as the direct one. from Roberts a new road should be cut to intersect the Alachua road near Ubank's place. in this distance two Bridges over creeks will be required and perhaps a third small one, and towards the east end of it many low places will require to be thrown up. From Ubanks to Jacksonville but little if any work is required, from Jacksonville to St Augustine some little repairs to the old Kings road is required and some causwaying near St Augustine and perhaps some of the Bridges on the old Kings road may require to be renewed by this time Before reporting on that part of the road between this and Tallahassee I wish to obtain some information which will be had in the course of a visit I am about to make to the east end of the road * I am Sir With very high rspt your obt svnt S.

V* The United States, surveyed, on the 30th ult” I made the report thereon to the Secretary of the Treasury of which a copy is enclosed,” and I now enclose for your information and government a copy of his letter of the 3° inst:" stating that “according to the views of the Department the decree of the Court contemplates a separate survey of each of the three first mentioned tracts; and also of the exterior lines and boundaries of the fourth tract, leaving the boundary lines of the reservation embraced therein to be surveyed when its extent and limits shall be settled by the Court below”— You will therefore have the several tracts referred to surveyed in strict conformity to the decree of the Supreme Court. If in making the surveys the lines should be found to intersect any of the lines already run and marked in surveying the public lands or private claims, such accurate connections should be made, as will enable you to calculate the areas of the tracts so interfered with by the lines now to be run. I also transmit herewith for your information a copy of the decree in the case, duly certified by the Clerk of the Court, together with a printed copy of the entire record from the Court below, containing all the documents upon which the claim is founded. This copy should not go out of your possession, and must be returned to this office with your approved plats of the surveys. You are requested to notify Mr Mitchel whenever you are prepared to furnish the instructions to the Deputies who may be appointed to execute the survey in order that he may, if he deems proper, furnish you with any additional information of which he may be possessed upon the subject."

Now therefore, that equal and impartial justice may be done, and nothing of unkind feeling be preserved to the parties: I Jn.” H Eaton Governor of the Territory of Florida do hereby pardon acquit release and discharge the said Oscar White and John D Edwards from payment of the fine of said breach of the law so assessed respectively against them by the Superior Court for Leon County Seal of the Given under my hand and the Territory of Fla seal of this Office the date above written JN° HEATON Govt of Florida By the Governor R.

Ob"S" JNo HEATON To R A GREENS Esq. Sec of Georgia Deposited by me in the Union Bank &amp; the cirtificate of deposit sent by mail to Mr Sanks J H EATON TALLAHASSEE Executive Office Feb’ 6” 1835 SIR. In reply to your inquiry who is entitled to receive the salary of Superintendent of Indian Affairs from the 17th of April 1834 when Governor DuVals; term expired to the 30" of June when the Act of Congress passed which took from the Governor of the Territory, the right of future superintendance; I have to remark that none can be entitled to receive the pay except myself, But as none of the duties were performed by me, I wave the right to receive it, and do hereby relinquish it. Respectfully JN° HEATON TO GEN WILLIE THOMPSON Union Bank of Florida recept for Bonds signed 1835 I John G. Gamble President of the Union Bank of Florida do hereby acknowledge to have received of Jn” H Eaton Governor of Florida Six Hundred and Forty bonds of one Thousand dollars each numbered as follows to wit. from Three Hundred and sixty one to One thousand both numbers inclusive, the said Bonds amounting to Six hundred and forty thousand dollars; have been issued by said Eaton and received by me in virtue of the provisions of an Act passed by the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida on the 13" day of February 1833 entitled “An Act to incorporate the subscribers of the Union Bank Of Florida” Given under my hand this 10" day of February 1835 JOHN G GAMBLE Prest. Seal of the Bank Governor Eatons answer to Col" Murats letter concerning the directory of the Union Bank of Florida Your letter soliciting the interference of the Executive because Col." Nutall whom you aver to be a partner of Col" Braden and hence disqualified to be a director of the Union Bank has been received and read. I beg leave to say that admitting the fact of partnership to exist, about which I know nothing; No authority or right exists for me to interfere; Infractions of the charter are matters for the Juditiary, not the Executive to enquire about, the Governor shall nominate five directors and with the consent of the Council may appoint them, But here his power ceases, and should a vacancy from any cause whatever occur, the Board only by the Charter is compitent to supply the vacancy; In support of your application you refer me to a law of the present session, which grants authority to the Governor to remove from office Justices of the Peace; Auctioneers and other officers for satisfactory cause shown, The law is misconceived by you: A director is not an officer, His is mere trust, But suppose the right do exist, still another difficulty arises, which is that sufficient cause is not shown, Cause for removal from office must be a something done by the individual complained of and not by another. The complaint made by you, does not show, a culpability on the part of Col" Nutall, but on the part of the Stockholders, for selecting him to be a director, he being as you state a partner of Col” Braden, In this point of view the error is theirs not his; But taking the fact to be, as it is stated there would be no right, both being duly chosen, to remove Nutall more than Braden; At any rat I cannot perceive any authority, that I can have to interfere Very respectfully JNo HEATON 17th Feby 1835 TO COL” A MURAT Issued this day to James D Westcott the following draft Executive Office TALLAHASSEE March 6* 1835 LEVI WOODBURY Esq. Secretary of the Treasury At three days sight pay to James D Westcott J or order Five hundred dollars for and on acc" of the compilation of the Laws of Florida agreably to an Act of the Legislative Council of S*Territory of Florida Approved 17* Feb 1835, which requires the Executive, “To draw for and advance to the contractors the sum of Five hundred dollars and no more, till the said work (Compilation of the Laws) is completed, when he shall draw for and pay over the whole amount of the appropriations in arrear Given under my hand and the seal of the Territory this 6* day of March 1835 JNo HEATON Seal of the Territory TALLAHASSEE 2 April 1835” MF LEVI WOODBURY SIR Last year the appropriation for the contingencies of the Executive Office of Florida was $350, the same has been made this year, making for the two years $700" I have made a draft on the appropriation for 1834 for 15375/100 and on that for 1835 for 3850/100 the balance remaining then for the two years then is $518 The office is without the comforts which should belong to it. A few chairs, some stained (painted) desks and an old pine table, make up its cataloge of furniture, there are no curtains to the windows, no settees as you have in the City &amp; no decent cases in which to preserve the books and records of the office and no carpet to the floor. I disire to avoid any expense upon anything of uncertainty of right; and therefore ask you and therefore ask you to say; whether I may be at liberty out of the balance of these two appropriations of 1834 and 35 for contingencies to expend it for such purposes as I have suggested Evidently they are contingencies to expend for such purposes, I have proposed, I beg the favor of you to advise me whether I can do so, or not &amp; I will be governed accordingly. The draft made upon you and forwarded 18" Feb' last for pay of members and Officers have never been heard from altho 44 days have intervened, which is double the period for a letter to go to and return from Washington City Very respectfully Y. Obt S* JNo HEATON There is a balance in the Treasury of $2500 appropriations undrawn of former years say 1834. Against this there are claims of 4 or 500 Dollars, outstanding &amp; which were refused to be paid at the Treasury on acc" of a repealing law of Congress passed 18 June 1834" Surely that law Could not, ough not to have a retrospective effect. I wrote to the Auditor M Harrison in relation to one of them M* Haywards and disired him to consult you; If that is paid I suppose I may draw drafts for the others, which stand on the same footing. EXECUTIVE OFFICE 2 April 1835 SIR A petition addressed to the Legislative Council has been forwarded to me, Charging Balley Winn Justice of the Peace for Jefferson County with certain enormaties and offences &amp; asking that he may be removed from his said office; By a cirtificate accompaning said petition it appears that the Grand Jury have found a Bill of Indictment against the said Winn which is yet pending before the Court A statement of the facts being certified to me I shall feel myself constrained to act, but when it further appears that the matters complained of are undergoing a juditial enquiry, the subject is presented in a different form; and I am to forbear until the party can be heard in his defence. The finding of a Grand Jury is always of ex parte character, and altho it creates a strong presumption of guilt does not necessarily make out the certainty of guilt pending a criminal prosecution, The Executive should forbear doing any thing, which by possibility even; could effect the rights and interest of the accused; The removing the incumbent from office before trial, might create a prejudice against him on the public mind, too strong for him to resist, A further reason for now refusing to act is, that by the present law, the Court is authorised upon conviction to make the removal from office a part of the sentance to be imposed under all the circumstances, I do not think it a proper case for the Executive to interfere with, The law having taken hold of the matter its action must be wated for Very respectfully JNo HEATON COL" JAMES PARISH The letter which enclosed the petition expressed a wish that my decision should be communicated to you J H E Executive Office at TALLAHASSEE April 2" 1835 EDITOR OF THE JACKSONVILLE CORIER I send you the Acts of the last Legislative Council with a request that you will publish them in your paper provided the cost of doing so, shall not exceed one Hundred and Twenty five dollars ($125) They have been published here at that price and indeed it is all the acts of Congress appropriates Very respectfully JN° H EATON ExECUTIVE OFFICE Territory of Florida It has been represented to me that Isaac Nathans of Jackson County lately at the Superior Court held for said County was found guilty of an assault and battery on a certain Rob" W Bell and that a fine greatly disproportionate to the offence charged has been assessed in as much as his precunary circumstances are moderate; It is shown also that the battery was of a mild not violent nature, occasioning no boddily injury to the party; and the provoking cause (to wit) the abuse and slander of the female part of his family, rendered his conduct and course in a great degree excusable if not entirely justifiable It further appears that said Nathans bears a reputation of being an orderly, quiet, and peaceable member of Society; and that tho present when the assault was committed by Sewell upon Bell it was unknown to him that any thing of the kind was meditated. Now I Jn” H Eaton Governor of the Territory of Florida in virtue of the Authority to me confided, do hereby release, acquit, discharge and pardon said Isaac Nathans of Ninety-five dollars, part of the fine of One Hundred dollars so assessed against him at the recent Superior Court for Jackson County Given under my hand and the seal of the Territory this 4" day of April AD 1835 and of the Indipendance of the UStates the 59" year JNo HEATON GOV" of Florida Seal of the Territory Memorandum On the 29" of April 1835 Gov" Eaton endorsed five Hundred bonds of the Bank of Pensacola as provided for by an act entitled “An Act to increase the Capital stock of the Bank of Pensacola and amend the laws incorporating said Bank and for other purposes” passed Febru; 13" 1835 and Approved Feby 14th 1835 Said Bonds being marked as follows A B C D E, and numbered from 1 to 100 both inclusive of each letter; And on the 21* of May 1835 said indorsements were countersigned by the Secretary of Florida; and on the 21" &amp; 22" of May 1835 the seal of the Territory was affixed thereto and on the said last day they were delivered to Walter Gregory president of the Bank of Pensacola R.

Sec Papers relating to the sale of some Indian Lands by Yellow Hair to Coe &amp; Raney Know all men by these presents, That whereas it has been made to appear to the undersigned Secretary and Acting Governor of the Territory of Florida that John Walker who is the head chief of the town of Indians known as Ematlochees town and Conope and Tusta- nuccohocond sub-chiefs of said town have by deed of conveyance conveyed to Yellow Hair formerly a sub-chief in said town but at present principal chief of Blunts Indians in Texas a section and a half of land granted to Mulatto King or Vacapachacacy and Tuscanuggy Hago, for the benefit of themselves sub-chiefs and worriors by a treaty executed by James Gadsden on the part of the United States and said Mullato King and Tuscanuggy Hago principal chiefs and Yellow Hair and other sub-chiefs on behalf of the Apalachicla band of Indians executed at Popes Fayette County in the Territory of Florida on the 18" day of June 1833 and whereas it has been further made to appear to the undersigned by the affidavids of Stephen Richards and Jim Walker an Indian Interpreter and a man of color that it was the express understanding amung said Indians at the time of the Treaty, and which said understanding has been since fully recognised and approved in Council by said band and that John Walker one of the signers of said deed is the sole principal chief of said Town and whereas it has been further made to appear that said Yellow Hair has sold said section and a half subject to the survey and locattion to be made by the United States to Jessee Coe and David G. Raney for the sum of Thirty two Hundred and Fifty dollars and that said sum is the full value of said land Now Know ye that in consideration of the premises and by virtue of the authority vested in the undersigned by the Treaty aforesaid the said conveyance to the said Yellow Hair and the said sale from the said Yellow Hair to the said Jessee Coe and said David G. Raney is hereby confirmed Ratified and Approved nevertheless the said approval is upon this express condition to wit said Jessee Coe and David G.

WELLFORD PV* Sec TALLAHASSEE June 11*1835 J M SCOTT Esq." Dr SIR I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 9" Inst respecting the securities of the Clerk of your County Court, I regret that I do not feel authorized to interfere in their relief, but in the absence of all law authoriseing such interfereance on the part of the Executive it would be wholy unjustifiable if not entirely void The law requires the Clerk on his election to give security but provides no way for the release of the security or for the giving of new security by the Clerk should the security first given be released by the Executive, there would be no authority to demand of the Clerk new security and the public interest might thus be placed in the hands of an irrisponsable officer without any safe-guard This case is one of the many omissions in our laws pointed out by their practical opperation and to be releaved against only by further legislation I am sir with great respect and regard Y Ob"S" GEORGE K WALKER EXECUTIVE OFFICE June 8* 1835 TO THE HON' JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT Mosquitoe County SIR Returns of an election held on the 4* day of May last in in Mosquitoe County for a member to represent that County in the next Legislative Council have been rec" at this Office The time for holding the election was changed by an act of the last Council from May to October, which fact it is presumed was not known in your County at the time of the election The election not having been held at the time required by Law, I would suggest the propriety of holding another in October as otherwise your county may not be represented in the next Council Very respectfully Y. Ob'S' GEORGE K WALKER A Copy of the above letter was sent to the Judge of the Cty Court for Alachua Cty TALLAHASSEE June 30* 1835 MY DEAR SIR Your letter of the 28* Ins" was not placed in my hands until this morning and I am much indebted to you for the information it contains. But I am induced to hope from the circumstances that nothing has reached me on this subject from that part of Florida where the Indians are said to have assembled that the rumour to which you allude is without cause or greatly exaggerated, had any manifestations of a hostile disposition been shown by the Indians in that quarter, I should no doubt have been informed by the inhabitants and their failue to do So renders it improbable that any such exist In any event however the miletary force stationed at Camp King would be immediately brought into action and is sufficiently strong to quell any insurection that may occur. I learn that an order has been issued by Gen.' Thompson the Agent near Camp King directing all Indians beyond the limits to return within them and on their failue to do so the miletary will be used for that purpose This will of course render any other measures for the protection of our Citizens unnecessary. A revenue cutter is at this time in the port of S" Marks which would no doubt cooperate in any measures which might be necessary to be taken I am Sir Very respectfully Y. Ob"S" G. K.

<docbody>TO GENERALTHO" S. JESUP Q Master General, Washington City D.C. SIR: In compliance with the instructions contained in yours of the 7" instant,” I have the honor to report; That immediately on the receipt of information from the department of my appointment to take charge of that part of the military Road te Tallahassee from St: Augustine to Tallahassee,” I proceeded to examine the road from this place to a distance of about fifty miles; and being within 20 miles of Newnansville—My examination had more particular reference to the part of the Road, from the St: Johns River to its intersection with the road from Tampa Bay to Colerain Ge" being about 38 miles. This road was formerly opened by M. Bellamy I believe about 1824 *—The work was badly done, the Trees having been cut out for a width of 20 feet—and the stumps left standing from 1 to 2 feet in height in the road. The causways were badly made, and in no instance were they raised to a sufficient height to ensure a dry bed for the road. The trace of the road, in many instances being very serpentine, merely to avoid an occasional low spot of ground, in the direct course. In proceeding from the river, there will be ditching and causwaying on the first 12 miles of about 3 miles (summing up all the low wet places,) In straightening the road, there will be a considerable quantity of cutting &amp; grubbing (the grubbing will would be common to both the new and old trace.) From the 12" mile to about the 27" mile the country is generally high and rolling and sandy—there will be but little work required on that distance, cutting out fallen logs and increasing the width from 20 to 30 feet. From the 27" mile the country again becomes flat, requiring ditching and causways for about 3 miles in the next 10 miles and opening from 20 to 30 feet. This is the only part of the road as yet examined by me west of the St. Johns River— I shall endeavor to leave this between the 1" and 10" of August, to examine the road from this to Tallahassee, and shall report the state of it immediately on my return. On the 20" instant I broke ground on the west bank of the St. Johns River, with a force of 25 men, which has been gradually increased to 35 men. I have employed as yet none but white laborers. Several days were required in getting them well organized and putting the tools &amp;c in order. I have the party, now divided into three squads— The one employed in cutting and opening out the road. The second in ditching and causwaying; The third in grubbing and taking out the stumps of trees. The leading points in my instructions to my director are the following. To cut and clear out the trees for a width of 30 feet—To cut down all trees, within 20 feet of the edge of the road that have an evident inclination towards the road.—To have the stumps and roots taken our for a width of 25 feet.—To have the causways and bridges 20 feet wide, the former from 1% to 2 feet higher than the adjacent ground—and the latter above the highest waters— To follow the old trace unless by varying from it, there is a saving of distance, and improvement in the bed of the road— I feel confident, should we all continue to enjoy health, that I shall be able to give you a good account of my progress at the end of August. I have been compelled to give high wages, averaging $20. per month, but good men could not be obtained at this season of the year to work in the country for less. I will now proceed to give you my ideas in relation to the Road— for which purpose I will consider it as divided into three sections. The first from St. Augustine to Picolata on the St. Johns (18 miles). The Second from the St. Johns to Newnansville distant about 60 miles—The third from Newnansville to Tallahassee about 30 miles— The third section is now travelled, by the mail and all travellers from west to east &amp; the reverse, and I am told is in pretty good condition. The second section was cut out some 8 or 10 years since, but for the want of a good ferry across the St. Johns, and the fact of the road having been badly constructed it has been entirely abandoned for the last 5 or 6 years. With the road well constructed and a good ferry at the St. Johns it will soon become the general thoroughfare, from east to west, as there will be a saving of 40 miles by this route from St. Augustine to Newnansville, from the route necessarily travelled between said points at present via Jacksonville-and all the Alachua Trade will seek this road. The first section is now and will continue to be that mostly travelled Picolata being the point on the St. Johns at which the Steam Boat from Savannah lands passengers. There is now stages 2, 3 &amp; sometimes 4 running weekly &amp; twice a week with passengers, between the St. Johns and St. Augustine-It is not withstanding the worst part of the whole road that I have seen, being extremely crooked and passing a greater part of the distance thro' a low flat country which at a wet time is so boggy as to render it almost impassable, and my opinion is that it would cost more to repair and make good the old trace—than it would to lay out a direct trace from St. Augustine to Picolata—with some slight variations from a direct line. I have to request permission from the department to change the location, wherever there is a manifest advantage to be gained either in distance or quality of the ground for a road. This part of the road is destined to become a very great thorough fare-and my opinion is that a good and direct road should be constructed at once, and if the Department approves it, I will on my return from Tallahassee raise a party and commence work at once from this city to Picolata—I make the above suggestions, from the present conviction the $4000. will make good the road from the St. Johns to Newnansville, and the remaining $3000. could not be more usefully applied than from St. Augustine to Picolata—having no personal interest in any part of the whole road, I have given my candid conviction above &amp; unbiased.” I am very respectfully Sir, Your obt. Servant F. L. DANCYLieut. &amp; A.A.Q. Master [Endorsed] 318. Letter Lt. F. L. Dancy St. Augustine, July 31, 1835. Lt. Dancy is authorized to vary the line of the road where distance can be saved and better ground be obtained, provided the change be made without a material increase of the expense.” That part of the road between Picolata and St. Augustine may be repaired.

<docbody>SIR, In consequence of the uncertainty of the arrival at, and departure of the Mail from this place, by the way of Charleston, under the last contract, I expect to be compelled to send the Motto occasionally to that city. If she had not been absent at Nassua, in July, I should have dispatched her on the 15" of that month, with the public documents due the different branches of the Service, at Washington, and elsewhere, from this Post, and directed the Captain to bring the mail. As the vessel which should bring it has not yet arrived, and as we have been three months without the mail the Motto sails with it to morrow, to Charleston. Under the previous contract made with M. Oliver O'Hara, by the Post Office Department, and disposed of by him to M' Housman of Indian Key, and Capt. Cold of the Schooner, John Dennison, the mail which was carried by Capt. Cold was received very regularly. The Citizens as well as the Military here, would be glad if an arrangement to carry the Mail could again be made with these persons. It is highly important to the Public Service, that we should get it at this Post at least once a month regularly, but if the contract for carrying it has been made, as I understand it has, there is every probability, that we shall get it very irregularly, and often suffer from failures. I will thank the Qr. Mr. Gen' to see the Post Master General on this subject. You will perceive from the enclosed communication from Gen Clinch that the services of the Motto will be required, to enable me to execute his instructions. I send you in a separate envelop the Key West Enquirer. With great respect, I am Your obedient Servant F. L. DADE Bvt. M. U.S.A.A.A. C &amp; Qr Master Commd." BVT. MAJ. GEN'. T.S. JESSUP Qr.

After the 20" May, all communications for General Clinch, will be directed to Fort Marion, St: Augustine, Florida. The General wishes a Copy of your Post Return forwarded monthly.

<docbody>SIR, Your several communications, relating to the Donation made and laid off for the Rail Road Company of Tallahassee "—for the surveys of the private claims decreed by the Supreme Court at their Session of 1834."—that to Collin Mitchell Esq &amp; Others of 1835*— together with yours of date 6" inst.* requiring an estimate &amp;" for the ensueing year * have all been duly received, with their accompanying documents respectively; and the necessary measures, have been adopted on my part to have them executed at as early a period as their requirements demand—It becomes my duty to inform you that the business of my Office has been almost suspended for several weeks past, owing to the indisposition of all my clerks, one of whom has been absent with leave for some time, one other dangerously ill, and the third I hope will sone be enabled to resume his duties efficiently, although at no time entirely suspended—I have been enabled thus far to attend to my branch of the duties, without any or but slight interruption. Much sickness prevails in the country generally arising as is believed from a protracted rainy season (since the 1* June to the present time.) I have carefully examined the case of Panton Leslie &amp; C° as compiled in the printed volume sent me, and hope to be able to have the Decree in that case fully executed, and when completed shall be enabled to have laid down the Donation first above refered to. Mr R B Ker D* Sur" (who returned near three months since) has been confined with sickness, and as yet unable to make his returns for the Office. M' Washington is shortly expected to arrive, whose returns, together with M Ker's, will complete the contracts of last year. The quantity of work on hand arising from those contracts, together with the work about to be executed under the orders recently received will in all probability be as much as the Office can wade through until the fall of next year, taking into view the sickness which has prevailed in the country, and likely to continue for some time yet, and under this belief, I shall be governed in making the required estimate. The late period (a few weeks since) that I became furnished with instructions, to have the field notes of my Office transcribed under the appropriations of 1834 * &amp; 5.” has from the situation of the country, precluded my making any arrangements touching that subject, not being able to employ efficient Clerks up to the present period: consequently no part of those appropriations have been applied, nor yet can be, for a time to come. My health has been slightly impaired for a few days past, but sincerely hope that nothing serious may grow out of it. You will readily perceive that the object of this communication is to afford you general information, and I remain very respectfully Y." M* Ob" St ROBERT BUTLER JN° M. MooRE Esq." Acting Com" G. L.

<docbody>TO MAJOR GENERAL THO" S. JESUP Q Master General SIR. Enclosed I have the honor to forward you my returns connected with the operations on the military road from St: Augustine to Pensacola Fa during the month of August 1835. With an estimate of Funds for the same for the month of September 1835. which I hope will prove satisfactory. Operations were commenced by me on the 20" day of July on the west bank of the St. Johns River opposite the town of Picolata. I can scarcely say that we had got well organized and prepared to work to advantage before the 1" of August. Up to the 31" of August we had cleared and grubbed the road 30 and 25 feet wide for the distance of 15 miles—in which distance we had ditched and causwayed about 3,500 feet, made 5 bridges averaging 10 feet in length, where the road had been previously opened every stump left had to be cut down to the ground, which was worse than taking out a standing tree. The causways will require some little work on them after they have been allowed to settle, when I do not hesitate to say, it will be one of the best roads in the Territory. I think I shall be able to accomplish the distance to Newnansville for the amount stated in my communication of the 31* of July ultimo to the department, which is respectfully submitted.

In reply I have to state, that the act of Congress of 30th June 1834,” for the organization of the Indian Department, prescribes that the agency for the Florida Indians should be discontinued on the 31st day of December 1834. It is not in the power of this Department to reestablish it after their removal, unless provision is made by Congress, for that object. You will please to communicate this answer to the Chiefs, and inform them that however desirous they may be to have a separate agent, they cannot be permitted to make the want of one a reason for postponing a fulfilment of their engagements to remove to the country assigned to them West of the Mississippi.” Very &amp;c., LEWIS CASS. </docbody>

<docbody>SIR. The Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, on the 14" of Feb’ last passed an act incorporating the East Florida Rail Road Company,” with authority to construct a Rail Road from any point on the St Johns river or its tributaries, or South and East of said river to the Gulph of Mexico; and the Congress of the United States on the third of March last passed an act making certain grants to three Rail road Companies viz: one from Tallahasse to St Marks; one from Pensacola to the Chattahoochie river “and also another rail road authorized by acts of the Legislatures of the state of Georgia and the Territory of Florida, from the St Johns in East Florida to the Suwanne river in said Territory or to vacassa Bay at the mouth Of Said river” * We suppose the East Florida rail road company to be the one here described; but as there is some ambiguity in the description, owing probably to the haste with which the act was drawn and the late hour of the Session at which it passed Congress, the company, on whose authority and behalf we address you, before commencing their work or entering upon any of the public lands for that purpose, are desirous of your opinion upon the case, and of obtaining the consent of the Government to take such of said lands as in their opinion this act of Congress authorizes the Company to occupy. If the act do not apply to the East Florida Rail Road Company, it must be inoperative as there is none other to which it can apply; and it is hardly supposable that Congress would pass a nugatory act The constructing of this road through the public lands will add much more to their value than the worth of the small strip granted by the aforesaid act; and we have no doubt will be an inducement to the Executive to afford every lawful facility for the prosecution of the work. We have therefore to request that you will authorize the East Florida rail road Company to take the timber and land along the line of said road as specified in the aforesaid act, if in your opinion its provisions are applicable, as we presume they are, to said Company We have to solicit an early decision, as the Company are desirous of prosecuting their work immediately, and to wait for an explanatory act from Congress would lose to them the favourable season, and delay their operations for a year * We hand you with this a Copy of the Company's Charter Very respectfully Your Obt Servts DAVID HENSHAW THO.

<docbody>SIR, In your communication of the 12" instant, you request me to state, whether in my opinion, the Executive can, with propriety, under the provisions of the Act of Congress of the 3" of March 1835,” authorise the East Florida Rail Road company, to occupy the Public Lands for the construction of their Road, with the other privileges enumerated in the second section of said Act? The 4* Section of the Act referred to extends the previous provisions to three Rail Road companies, the last of which is described as a Rail Road “authorized by acts of the Legislature of the state of Georgia, and the Territory of Florida, from the St John's river in East Florida, to the Suwannee river in said Territory, or to Wacosom" Bay at the mouth of said river.” The act of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida incorporating the East Florida Rail Road Company, confers on that Company the privilege of constructing a Rail Road, “from any point on the S" John's river or its tributaries, or South and east of said river, to the Gulf of Mexico, or waters emptying therein”. This law therefore, in effect, authorises a Rail Road from the S" John's river to the Suwannee river (which empties into the Gulf of Mexico) or to Vacasom Bay (which is on the Gulf of Mexico); and if the Company determine to construct such a road, I think it will be brought within the provisions of the Act of Congress, unless there be some other Company authorised by acts of the state of Georgia and the Territory of Florida, more nearly answering to the description above quoted. I am informed by the communication accompanying your letter, that there is no such other company, and if this statement be correct, you will understand me as answering your question in the affirmative.” I have the honor to be, with great respect Your Ob' Serv" B.

I am induced to suppose that you wish to withdraw the Caveats which were filed by David Thomas, Attorney for the Deaf and Dumb Asylum of Kentucky, against the issuing of patents for certain preemption claims which interfered with the Selections made for that institution. If such is your wish, you will please inform this Office of the Same, as soon as possible, as it is important that the Suspended cases in Florida should be settled. I would merely remark by the way, it is probable that in many of those cases where the proof was not sufficient to entitle the claimants to the benefit of the Act of 22* April 1826," occupation and cultivation since that time, may bring those cases within the provisions of subsequent preemption laws.

<docbody>THE REGISTER Tallahassee, Florida. SIR, The following tracts, which were entered under Writs of Mandamus issued by Judge Woodward, having been Suspended, for Several years, in this Office, it is important that they should, if possible, be settled, and either confirmed to the claimants, or offered at public sale. To effect this, you are requested immediately to reexamine these cases, and see if they will not come within the provisions of the Act of 19* June 1834." In those cases where eighths of Sections have been entered under writs of Mandamus from Judge Woodward, and where the requirements of the Act of 29" May 1830,” have been complied with, or, if they can be brought within the provisions of the Act of 19* June 1834, that is, if Settlement and cultivation can be fully proved, as required by either of those acts, this Office will not hesitate to issue the patents for the eighths referred to, provided the claimants relinquish all further right to the benefits of the Several preemption Acts. Where two individuals were settled upon the Same quarter Section, and were, under Judge Woodward's decision, permitted to enter two other quarter Sections, making three eighths to each individual, when the law expressly says, that no individual shall be permitted to enter more than one quarter Section, it will be impossible to act unless the claimants will agree to Surrender the right to one quarter, and receive patents for the other two, as tenants in common. The following is a list of the tracts above referred to. List of lands entered under Writs of Mandamus. No of Certificate Part of Sec. Sec. Town" | Range Name of Purchasers.

It is probable that the Agent for the Deaf and Dumb Asylum of Kentucky will withdraw the caveats which were filed against the issuing of patents for the above tracts, as he stated in a letter to this Office, dated 20" April 1830," that it is his wish to avoid, as far as possible, all collision with preemption claimants, I would advise you to consult with him, as he was written to from this Office upon that Subject. You will, however, investigate these cases, and receive Such testimony therein, and also in the foregoing cases, as in your judgment is respectable, and sufficient to bring them within the provisions of the Acts before referred to; if the claimants upon due notice being given them. See proper to produce the Same. The case of Peter W. Guatier should be carefully investigated:—he cultivated by his Slaves the NE 3% Sec 19. T 5 N. R. 10 W. but lived in Georgia. Did he cultivate in 1833, and occupy in 1834, and is this the only tract to which he lays claim as the original preemptor? Your immediate attention is requested to these matters. I am &amp;c ETHAN A.

<docbody>SIR; The time will soon arrive when a large number of the Seminole tribe of Indians have agreed to remove to the West. There are still however a large number that are unwilling to remove; &amp; from recent indications I am induced to believe, that force will have to be used to compel them to comply with their Treaty Stipulations— Where the peculiar nature, extent, &amp; exposed state of the Indian frontier is taken into consideration, it will I think, be readily admitted, that the force placed under my command is inadequate to enforce a compliance with their Treaty, &amp; to give such protection to the frontier settlements, as their apprehensions from the Indians &amp; from another species of population, induce them to expect from the Government— Under this view of the subject I am induced respectfully to submit a few remarks, for the consideration of the General-in-Chief, &amp; if approved by him, for that of the proper department. I consider the force already in Florida sufficient to meet &amp; controul the whole of the refractory Seminoles, if they could be concentrated—But when scattered over a large extent of country, composed of marshes &amp; swamps that are almost impenetrable to the white man, it is entirely inadequate to give that protection &amp; quiet to the frontier inhabitants which they expect—Frequent applications have already been made, from different Sections of the country, for protection, in case we should have any difficulty in removing the Seminoles; &amp; some of the most respectable planters fear that there is already a secret &amp; improper communication carried on between the refractory Indians, Indian, negroes, &amp; some of the plantation negroes—For the better protection of the frontier settlements, &amp; to stop all intercourse between the Indians &amp; plantations, in case any difficulty should arise in removing the Indians, I strongly &amp; respectfully urge &amp; recommend, the calling into the service of the U. States, for the term of two or three months, one hundred &amp; fifty mounted volunteers, to be stationed at such points as the Commanding Officer may think best to effect the object in view, &amp; not to be ordered within the Indian boundary, unless in case of absolute necessity—This force to be held ready, but not called into actual service until required; &amp; to be disbanded as soon as their services could be dispensed with—This species of force would, in my opinion, owing to the nature of the country, be the most efficient &amp; least expensive under all the circumstances of the case, that could be employed—Being well mounted &amp; all of them good woodsmen &amp; good riders, &amp; well acquainted with every part of the country-&amp; many of them deeply interested in its protection—would give them a decided advantage over any other species of Troops for the kind of service they would be required to perform; &amp; I have no doubt they could be raised without any difficulty—I have the honor further to request, that one of the Revenue Cutters stationed on the Gulf of Mexico, maybe ordered to cruise along the coast from Charlotte's harbour to Tampa Bay, between the 1* December &amp; 1" January next, &amp; to cooperate with Brvt Major Dade's command, in ordering in &amp; securing if neces- sary, all the Indians they may find on that coast; &amp; on their arrival at Tampa Bay, to remain subject to the orders of the officer commanding the Troops in Florida. A small armed vessel of that class would, in my opinion, aid our operations very much, &amp; could be placed on that kind of duty for a short time without the least injury to the revenue service—The Service assigned me, &amp; the Troops under my command, is arduous, disagreeable &amp; perplexing, &amp; without the least prospect of reaping any honor; but it will be cheerfully performed to the best of my abilities—I feel deeply anxious to remove the Seminole Nation without resorting to force; but being on the ground, &amp; in possession of all the facts, I feel it my duty to state them for the information of the General-in-Chief, &amp; the Department of War, &amp; to give it as my opinion, that we shall have to strike a blow at the Mickasuky tribe, before they will surrender the murderers of Dalton, or agree to comply with their Treaty—This however, will be the last alternative; but I earnestly request that the Government place the means in my hands to enable me, when it becomes absolutely necessary, to strike effectually, &amp; to give protection to the frontier settlements; otherwise many lives &amp; much property may be lost— I have the honor to be With high respect Your most ob’t D.

<docbody>SIR, The enclosed copy of a letter from Lt Col Fanning ” [Marked C.] is submitted for the consideration of the General in Chief. My first wish is to carry out the humane and benevolent views of the Government, in relation to the Seminole Indians in the way most conducive to their happiness and comfort and least expensive to the Nation with these objects constantly in view. I may have rather under estimated the means necessary to carry into effect the views and plans of the Government. By refering however, to my letter of the 18" January last,” You will perceive that I requested that Six Companies might be added to the Command in Florida, four of which only were ordered to Fort King. In my Communication of the 8. inst,” I stated “I considered the force already in Florida sufficient to meet and control the whole of the Refractory Seminoles if they could be concentrated. But when Scattered over a large extent of Country, composed of marshes &amp; swamps that are almost impenetrable to the white man, it is entirely inadequate to give that protection and quiet to the frontier inhabitants which they Expect” Since writing the foregoing I have been informed by Asst Surgeon Archer” that nearly one hundred of the Command now at Fort King have been more or less sick within the last two or three months and although many of them for fit for Garrison duty, and most of the others are convalescent, they cannot be relied on, for active efficient service I therefore have the honor respectfully to request that three additional Companies be ordered to fort King with as little delay as practicable, with an amply supply of ball and buck shot cartridges. Should this request be complied with, and the Companies ordered from the North it would be economy of time and money to engage transports drawing not more than eight feet water to take the Troops direct to the S" Johns river and land them on the West Side of that river opposity picolata, where there is a good road leading to Fort King and from which place transportation could be sent to meet them if timely notice is given to the Commanding Officer at that post. It is extremely painful to me, to have to allude to myself in any of my Communications but I am sometimes compelled to do So. It is now nearly twelve months since I was placed in Command of the troops in Florida during which time I have now no Staff, not even a private with me, whose services I could claim except as a matter of courtesy— It is true that Lt R. P. Smith who I consider one of the first Young Officers in the Army of his rank has been kind enough to aid me with his services—but he is now assigned to duty in another section of the Country and I can no longer avail myself of his valuable Services. A Colonel Commanding a Regiment has his Regimental Staff to aid him in the discharge of his duties, I however whilst assigned by the Gen.' in Chief to an arduous &amp; important command have not even a confidential private to Copy my letters and orders. I hope therefore the Gen' in Chief will take this Subject under consideration. It is also in my in opinion of the first importance that an experienced and efficient officer of the Quarter Masters Department be ordered to join the Troops in Florida with as little delay as possible” I have the honor to be &amp;ct Your Obt Serv" (Signed) D L. CLINCH B" B'g Gen'l U.S.A. P.S. Should the three additiehal companies be ordered and, the Volunteers authorised as requested, it will become necessary for the Commissariat Department to send an additional supply of provisions. They could however take the regular course to Fort King. With respect &amp;C." (Signed) D L CLINCH Br’t Brig Gen', U.S.A To/ BV" GENL R. JONES, Adj't General, 25 Robert Archer. </docbody>

<docbody>BRV* BRIG GEN. D. L. CLINCH, Fort King Florida. SIR, Your letter of the 8th instant* to the Adjutant General has been laid before me. I am well aware of the disagreeable nature of the duties entrusted to you, but I rely with confidence upon a faithful and judicious execution of them. It is very desirable to accomplish the object of removing the Seminole Indians without the application of actual force, and I cannot but hope that such will be the result.” You will of course proceed to embark and remove those first who are willing to go, postponing any decisive course with relation to the refractory ones till the others have set out. My impression is that they will then all peaceably follow. Should they not however do so, agreeably to their treaty stipulations and the arrangements they have entered into with you, you will proceed to carry into effect your instructions. All proper remonstrances and representations however should be previously made. It is out of the question under any circumstances to leave a lawless banditti, as they would then be if not removed, to form the associations which you apprehend with the negroes and to involve the frontier in blood. I have submitted to the President your proposition for the employment of a mounted military force, but there is, under existing circumstances, no authority for this measure. There is no appropriation authorizing it, nor can the case yet be brought within the Constitutional power of the President to call into service an additonal force for the defence of the country. A few days since, on the representations of Lieut. Harris, two additional companies were placed at your disposal, and I have this day directed the Adjutant General to put two more companies under your orders.” This will give you a force, as I understand from the Adjutant General, of fourteen companies, making an aggregate of seven hundred. This force, it appears to me, must be sufficient for all the purposes required. The President is disposed to direct a revenue cutter to aid your operations, agreeably to your suggestions, if one can be spared for that purpose. He will consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, and the result, if favorable, will be communicated to you.” L. C. </docbody>

<enclbody>SIR I take the liberty of addressing your Excellency on the subject of the removal of the Indians from this territory. The time is now drawing near when they will be required to comply with the Stipulations of their Treaty with the Gen' Gov" And as it is generally believed that they will not move without being made to do so by actual force—I respectfully beg leave to suggest whether it would not be advisable that a part of the militia should be held in readiness to protect the Inhabitants from any danger which may threaten them in such an event. Much apprehension is already manifested by the community at large on this subject. And particularly as there are a large number of Negroes amongst the Indians, who may be under the influence of the Abolitionists of the North, whose machinations, are now endangering our safety. Under these circumstances I hope I may be excused for calling on Your Excellency for such orders as may be deemed proper to avert the evil alluded to. And that Your Excellency will also provide me with from two to three Hundred musquets, with their corresponding accoutraments to arm some of the Inhabitants of this City and Jacksonville, together with Ammunition and the means necessary to sustain such a force as may have to be called in to active Service.— Should Your Excellency think proper to Authorize me to adopt these precautionary measures. I deem it my duty to add, that from one Hundred and fifty to two Hundred mounted men should be raised from the several Regts and posted from Spring Garden on the river S" Johns, thence northwardly to Pilatka, and from that point westwardly to the river Suwaney, as a cordon of safety, to prevent the Indians from coming out of their boundaries and to aid the United States troops if necessary. The people of the Country are generally provided with fire arms of some description or other, but, nevertheless, their appearance in the field, on such an occasion, should be an imposing one.

<docbody>SIR. I deem it proper to inform you, that I had ordered on the 11" day of June last two Deputy Surveyors to execute the Decrees of the Supreme Court made at their January term 1834,” assigning with said work a sufficient portion of the public land on the Suwannee River to make their Contracts as I thought at least reasonable, iff not desirable—The proposition was met by them and the necessary Contracts and instructions were prepared accordingly to meet their arrival at the time specified— When they arrived (about the 10" Ult") I submitted these arrangements for their examination, and I regret to say they declined entering into the contracts deeming the Survey of those private claims so unprofitable. I have the satisfaction however to state, that I have just made an arrangement with another Deputy of experience, to perform this work, who will enter into contract in all the ensuing week and proceed for their execution forthwith—I shall forward the Contract so soon as entered into, together with one other made some time since for the Survey of the large claim, known as Forbes purchase decreed by said Court at their last term. Mr Washington has not yet returned from his tour, owing to indisposition as reported by him, and I contemplate that he, together with M Goldsborough (who surveys the large claim above mentioned) will survey the residue of the public lands contained in the Diagram forwarded with my estimate, thus embracing all the work estimated for during the ensueing year. The surveying of the private claims under any circumstances is a very laborious and irksome business, * See post, p. 217. but particularly so, when scattered over the country in detached parcels, and renders it very difficult to obtain experienced surveyors to execute them, as they are generally a losing business- My health has been slightly impaired during the last month, owing to a violent cold settled on my lungs accompanied with pain in the breast and side, though now improving under salutary remedies.” I have the honor to be Very respectfully Y" M* Ob*S* ROBERT BUTLER E.

Switzer, who was engaged in preparing a very extensive orange Grove, who after plundering the houses, set fire to, and burnt them to the ground. At the time this outrage was committed, the place was in the care of an intelligent Negro, M Switzer, having left the place a few days previous, in his boat, on business down the river.

And if the repealing clause itself be questionable, there are also penalties and disabilities attached to the Act which are repugnant to the act of Congress approved March 30" 1822 and which infringe the restraining clauses of that Act as applied to the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida, providing “that no expost facto law, or law impairing the obligations of contracts shall ever be passed, nor shall private property be taken for public uses without just compensation therefor” Your memorialists beg leave to refer to the Legislative Act repealing the Charter of Key West (herewith attached) for palpable evidence of personal legislation unparalleled in modern times,—for fines and disabilities leveled against individuals, not designated by name, it is true, but sufficiently pointed out by reference to their offices.— The Citizens of Key West have now no benefit of a City government in preserving peace and good morals or in directing the united energies of the community to public improvement and comfort: nor have they quarantine regulations calculated to prevent the introduction of contagious disease into this exposed position; and in consequence of resignations there has not been for some time a Justice of the Peace upon the Island—From the little intercourse with the Seat of Territorial Government a long time must necessarily elapse and great inconvenience be felt before these evils can be remedied:— wherefore your Memorialists pray that the Act of the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida approved January 29" 1835 be disapproved and annulled by an Act of Congress—And your Memorialists will ever pray &amp;c— KEY WEST, South Florida.

<docbody>SIR I have the Honor to Acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10" Ins” Conveying the sentiments expressed by the President in the measures which I deemed it my duty to suggest consequent on the removal of the Indians from this territory. The Regular forces which have been ordered on this service, under Gen Clinch, aught certainly to be sufficient to Convince the Indians of the fixed determination of the Gov" to remove them; which alone should be enough to induce them to move peaceably. But, whether they will be actuated by correct impressions, or become obstinate and refuse to go at all, are Circumstances, which, with such a people, Cannot easily be foreseen. Should they refuse to go, and be roused to Acts of aggression, which their late conduct indicates, much injury may be done by them before the Troops, unacquainted as they are with the Country, and being on foot, could possibly come up with them to prevent it In this state of uncertainty, it is natural to suppose, that much apprehension will continue to be felt by the Inhabitants, for the safety of their lives and property until the removal of these people is fully accomplished. I herewith respectfully beg leave to transmit to you the Annext Copy of a letter of mine to the Colonels Commanding the 2" 4" &amp; 6" Reg" of the Brigade” which I have the Honor to command together with the reply from Col Warren of the 4**Consisting of the people of the Counties of Duval &amp; Nassau, that you may see the measures I am taking for the public safety. And the call which is made for Arms, of which there is great scarcity throughout the Country. As the President does not feel Authorized to call out the Militia until the reasons for it appear more decided, I have also respectfully to observe, that in such an event, before orders can be received either from the Governor at Tallahassee or from your Department, much damage may be done. I therefore hope, that in the absence of these orders, the President will be pleased to furnish me with five Hundred Musquets with their accoutraments and necessary Ammunition, that in Any event the people may be enabled to defend themselves.

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a letter this moment received from Lt. Col. Fanning, commanding at Ft. King, from which the Genl in Chief &amp; Sect of War. will learn that the unfriendly Indians are determined on mischief. When I left Ft. King, a short time since, every thing appeared quiet within the Indian boundary. On my return from Ft. King I had ordered Cap' Drane to hold himself in readiness to take post with his company, at some point near Valutia, for the protection of the East bank of the S* Johns river, which is very much exposed. I shall proceed immediately to Fort King, and on my arrival, &amp; ea Bay arrival should I find it necessary for the protection of the frontier Settlements, I will take on myself, the responsibility of calling out at least one hundred mounted men, until I can receive the orders of the Genl in Chief, in the full confidence, that my conduct will be approved by the Sect. of War, and by the President of the U. States, as the companies ordered from the West, cannot arrive in time. The Chief Charley O. Matler, was one of the most friendly intelligent and influential men in the Nation, and will be a great loss to the cause of Emigration. (In haste) I am with high respect your Most obt. D. L.

<enclhead> Alexander C. W. Fanning to Duncan L. Clinch FORT KING 27 </enclhead><encldate>Nov 1835. GENERAL A deep laid plan of villiany is just now developed. Powell is at the bottom of it. The friendly Chief Charley O Matler * was last night assasinated. It was also intended that Cohadjo &amp; Hotatkee OMatler should share his fate. There appears to be a general disaffection of the Indians, and, no doubt, War is determined. I this morning sent F. C° 2"Arty: to the Cattle pens, where the Indians Cattle were to be disposed of. On learning the fate of Charley OMatler, I immediately sent an express to Captain Mellon,” who had commenced his march, to proceed in haste to Wetumpka and join Capt Graham, and I directed Capt Graham, with the two companies, to make a forced march to the place of the late Charley OMatler, take under his protection Charley's family and his tribe, return with all possible dispatch to Wetumpka and fortify himself, also, to notify the settlers to be on their guard. Capt Mellon, after performing this service, was to return to this post. I am now in a situation of much embarassment, Pay Master Lytle * with a party of four mounted men, will in a day or two be returning from Tampa, I fear the worst on their account. To send a soldier through the country would be folly, and I cannot obtain an Indian or Negro. If I can possibly find means to convey information, I shall not only direct Major Lytle not to attempt to pass through the Country, but also direct the delay of the march of Frasier's " and Gardiner's "Companies until the arrival of the remaining two companies, already ordered from Tampa; so soon as they may arrive at that place Graham's Company marched to Wetumpka on the 18" inst all well; on the 23” it had nine men prostrated by sickness Six of these I had brought to this post. We have now more than sixty on the sick report What is to be done? Will not the settlers organize a force on the frontiers? Can you not send Drane's Company here? It will be much wanted at this point.

On the contrary I concur fully in your suggestions that these persons should be arrested without delay.

<docbody>HON' LEWIS CASS Secretary at War SIR. An express arrived at this place on the 6* Instant, bringing information of such a manifestation of the hostile disposition of the Seminole Indians, as rendered in my opinion the employment of a part of the Military force of the contry necessary for the protection of the inhabitants, residing near the Indian limits. Through this source I learn that a principal Chief of the nation, who had made known his determination of delivering up his property, to the Indian Agent employed by Government to superintend the removal of those Indians, for the purpose of being sold preparitory to his removal was put to death by his people," and another Chief averse to their emigration, chosen in his stead. The habitations of the Indi- ans in the vecinity of the United States troops were immediately abandoned, and in two or three nights afterwards an attack was made by a party of Indians on the House of a white man settler, who though repeatedly fired at on succeeded in escaping with his family, leaving his house to be pillaged, and distroyed by fire. The apprehensions on the frontier is represented as being so great that the people have desirted their homes and collected together for their mutual protection and difence. The regular troops stationed in the nation, consisting entirely of infantry and very limited in number, I regard as incompitent to protect so extensive a line of contry. Their movements must necessarily be slow, and the Indians secure in their morasses and swamps, may in small bodies penetrate into the settlements, lay waste the country, and retreat to their hiding places without ever being brought into action. Under these circumstances, I have ordered a troop of Baetihted three hundred mounted riflemen, to be immediately embodied and engaged in the protection of the Exposed Country, they are instructed not to enter the Indian limits unless further hostilities are perpetrated on the White Inhabitants, or in the event of the invasion of the Indian Country by the United States Troops their services shall be required by the commanding officer. I have received no communication either from the United States Agent stationed in the nation or from Gen Clinch the Officer commanding the troops on this subject. But the numerous applications made to me, from the most respectable sources in that section of the Contry, have satisfied me of the necessity of this measure. From all the information I have received in relation to the disposition of the Seminole Indians to comply with the treaty providing for their emigration I have no doubt that nothing short of compulsion will induce them to do so; If this course should be determined on and the requisite force for this purpose cannot be conveniently spared from other points, a sufficient number of volenteers can be raised in this Territory for that service.

<enclbody> SIR I have the honor to enclose you an extract of a letter from L' Col" Fanning” commanding at Fort King, from which you will learn that the Indian Chief Charles O Mathlee was assasinated on the 26" Ulto; This Chief was one of the most Friendly, intelligent, and leading men of the emigrating Party—and his murder gives stronger indications in my opinion of a settled plan on the part of those opposed to emigrating, to commit violence on the friendly party, than any thing that has occured within the last twelve months and this feeling unless promptly checked by the presence of an active and efficient force, on their northern and Eastern Frontier, will inevitably extend to the settlements of our fellow Citizens, and result in the loss of many valuable lives, and the distruction of much property.—The regular force placed under my Command, is inadiquate to give, the necessary protection to the inhabitants on our very extended frontier and to effect the other important objects confided to their care; I therefore have the honor respectfully to suggest to your Excellency the importance of immediately calling Out, and placing on the Indian Frontier; one hundred &amp; fifty mounted men.—This force if ordered to co,operate with the regular Troops under my Command, will in my opinion be sufficient to give protection to the frontier settlements extending from Indian River to the West Bank of the Suwannee. I have on my own responsibility ordered one hundred musketts &amp; fifty rifles. Ammunition &amp;c to be sent from Augusta Arsnal to this place to be used in Case of an emergency.—Last evening a volenteer Company Called the Florida rangers recently organised in this City, tendered to me their services in a very spirited and soldierlike manner and expressed a willingness to march at a moments notice to any point they might be required, but I had no authority to accept them I have the honor to be with high respect Your Most Ob' (Copy) D L CLINCH Brv Big Gen US Army P S I shall start for Fort King in the morning HIS EXCELLENCY G K WALKER Acting Gov' of Florida [Endorsed] F 46.271.

SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 27th ultimo.” The state of affairs in Florida, connected with the Seminole Indians, appears to be such, as well from the report of General Clinch, as from your own, that I am induced to accede to your proposition that arms may be issued from the publick stores, for the defence of the settlements. Orders have been given to the Ordnance Department to direct the officer in charge of the arms at the nearest depot, to issue five hundred muskets with their accoutraments and a proper supply of ammunition, upon your requisition.—The whole to be accounted for in the mode prescribed by the ordnance regulations, and the arms and accoutraments to be returned, as soon as the exigency is over.

<docbody>SIR Since my last letter to the General in Chief,” I have been constantly engaged in travelling through the Country to rouse and organize a sufficient number of volunteers to give immediate protection to the frontier settlements. My first object is to throw a sufficient force on the Indian line to drive these incendiary and murderous wretches within their limits, and as soon as I am in sufficient force, to strike a blow at their strong hold. I will teach them, that altho’ the Government has been heretofore mild and indulgent to them, that it knows when and how to punish them for their treachery and bad faith.” It is truly distressing to witness the panic and sufferings of the white frontier inhabitants. Men, women, and children are seen flying in every direction, and leaving everything behind them save a few articles of clothing. Many families that were comfortable and independent in their circumstances, are now reduced to want; their houses and their all having been plundered and burned by small bands of Indians, who have spread themselves through the Country, taking advantage of their knowledge of the swamps and hammocks to conceal their operations. The first object of every one was to remove their wives and children to a place of safety, and it was in vain to urge them to organize and throw themselves in advance of the enemy to check their progress. Nothing could be done until their families were secured. I expect one hundred mounted men here to day. These with the three companies that I shall have on the immediate frontier, will I think be sufficient to drive the Indians within their boundaries for a while. The loss of the vessel with our supplies has caused much inconvenience, as it takes a considerable part of our small force to pro- tect the boats and wagons engaged in transporting provisions. The uncertainty as to the time when the companies ordered from Louisianna, will reach Tampa, and the distance they will then have to march through a hostile country before they can join me, induces me to request that four additional companies be ordered to join me, with the least possible delay, completely prepared to take the field, with a good supply of ball and buckshot cartridges. It is also very desirable to have fifty good muskets and as many rifles sent at the same time, as there is a great deficiency of arms in the Country. All the information I receive in relation to the movements of the Indians, represent them as being in considerable force, and manifesting a determination to engage in War, murder, and plunder. It appears also that they are joined by the negroes, and if they are not promptly put down, this spirit may extend to the plantations. If additional troops are sent, they should be landed on the West Bank of the St Johns River, at Picolata, and march from thence to Fort King." I am with high respect Yr Mo Ob"S" D. L. CLINCH Brv.

<docbody>SIR. I have the honor to inform you, that in obedience to orders from Brig. Gen" Clinch, I arrived yesterday with my company from Fort Morgan, at this post, and assumed the command. - The excited state of the Indians in this vicinity and the hostility demonstrated by the plunder and burning of property has induced extraordinary exertions by my predecessor in Command, Capt Frazer accomplished by great energy and perseverance. Three more companies from N Orleans &amp; Key West are daily expected. Two comp" of the garrison here, and two of those expected, are by existing orders to be detached to Fort King, leaving Dades, Zanzingers &amp; my own for this defence, perhaps 90 effectives. The sick reports are large from fevers &amp; inflamatory diseases. The garrison with about 100 citizens &amp; families, are every night within the pickets, as well as the publick property. The supply of ammunition is scanty, for musquetry as well as for our 2 6-pdrs. A few hours since about 40 Indians, joined (with horses and families) our friendly party, across the river. Before this may leave (via Pensacola by return of our Transport) I may be able to report whether they are driven in, or that whether they are seceders from the hostile party, and indicate a dissolution of the mass. Our communications with Fort King are entirely broken up, and we have no expectation of communicating before the detachment of four companies, may force it. Our Quarters supply of provisions may hold out—Indians will receive rations for work, but as prudently as possible. About 30 Citizens (of families taking refuge here) have assumed an organization as rangers, and furnish patrols (mounted) by which the approaches are well observed during the earliest morning, or other hours, or circumstances indicating an attack—The Suttlers (Capt Saunders) country store 30 miles from this was plundered a short time back &amp; three nights since, the crop &amp; dwellings of M" Simmons, a planter, were burnt. Great confidence is felt by all, that an attack if seriously meditated must fail, &amp; by such a result materially aid the interests of the government. I have the honor to be Your Ob" Serv F.

<place-time><month>December</month><date>14</date><year>1835</year></place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.—The memorial of the undersigned being the President and a Majority of the Directors of the East Florida Rail Road Company, a Corporation duly established by a Law of the Territory of Florida, approved on the 14th of February A D 1835,” for the purpose of constructing a Rail Road from the Waters of the Atlantic Ocean, through the Territory of Florida, to those of the Gulf of Mexico, respectfully represents;—That the Governor and Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, at the last Session, passed certain resolutions recommending the enterprize in which your memorialists are engaged,” to the favourable notice of Congress, and asking in their behalf an appropriation of lands in aid of the work. That this recommendation was made, not merely with reference to the local benefits to accrue to the Territory of Florida, but to the greater advantages which the whole Country will derive from the Completion of the Road, which, in their opinion, entitled it to the favourable consideration of Congress. The resolutions referred to not having been received in Season for the action of Congress, at the last Session, the wishes of the Legislative Council were but partially fulfilled, by a grant of so much land, by Congress, as Comprehended the site of the Road, together with thirty feet on each side thereof.” Your Memorialists therefore respectfully ask, that these resolutions may be called up, at the present Session, and receive the favourable consideration of Congress. The Company in asking of Congress a compliance with the resolves of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, do it, less on the principle of asking a direct donation from Congress, than on that of an equitable grant of a portion of the benefits which the United States will derive from the outlay of the capital of the Company, by the enhanced value given to the public lands, Contiguous and adjacent to the line of the Road, and to the benefits they will receive in the transportation of Troops, munitions and the Public Mails. These benefits are certain to accrue to the United States, if the work be completed, but the profits on, and even the reimbursment of, the Capital of the Company, are uncertain, depending on numerous Contingencies. Relying with confidence, on the favourable action of Congress on this subject, the Corporation has already been Organized, the assessments required by the Charter paid, and preliminary steps taken for a Speedy survey of the Road."

<docbody>SIR, The day after my last letter to you,” a party of Citizens about 14 in number were fired on by a party of Indians, concealed in a Hammock, the number not known, &amp; one man killed and another had his horse shot from under him, and his arm broke. The party of Citizens were self organized and acted without the least judgement or prudence. If there had been authority for raising the 150 mounted men, recommended by me last Summer, the frontier settlements would at this time, have been quiet; a great deal of property saved &amp; much distress prevented—It is also very much to be regretted as our Indian affairs have taken the course they have, that the four additional companies had not have been ordered from the Atlantic instead of the Gulph, as in that event, they could have joined before this, &amp; I should have been in force to have opperated as soon as a sufficient quantity of provisions could have been placed in store at Fort King. As it is, it is impossible for me to form any idea when they will arrive at Fort Brooke, between which place &amp; Fort King, a distance of one hundred miles, through the centre of the disaffected &amp; hostile part of the Seminole Nation, there is no communication, the Indians having in several instances, stopped the runners, taken and broken open the letters—Thus you will perceive, when the seven Companies assemble at Fort Brooke, that my force will be equally divided &amp; neither strong enough to effect much in a Country like this— As soon however, as the Volunteers called out by the Gov. of Florida arrive, I will not delay a moment, but strike at once at their Stronghold. The last report from Brev. Major Dade, he was to leave Key West in the Schr: Motto, on a short leave of absence from Lt. Col. Twiggs, of course I cannot tell, when his company will arrive at Fort Brooke. I am with high respect your Most Obt. D. L.

<docbody>HONOURABLE LEWIS CASS Secretary at War SIR—Since my letter of the 8th Instant,” nothing of particular interest has reached me in regard to the Seminole Indians, I am in- formed by an individual from the frontier, that a Scout of eighteen men engaged in Scouring the Country about Thirty miles from the indian reserve were attacked by a Superior force, and effected their retreat to post with the loss of one man killed, and one wounded. Believing that the frontier could only be Succesfully protected by carrying the war in to the Enemies Country, I directed Brigadier General R. K. Call, to accept the Services of Such volunteers as might tender them to the number of five hundred men, that a force adequate to this purpose might be in readiness if required by the U.S. Officer in command at Fort King. This number of Florida volunteers under the command of General Richard K. Call, are by this time at their Station ready for duty. A large party of Indians are reported to have been Seen Between the Suwannee and S. Marks rivers with a great number of Canoes in which they Transport themselves along the coast and up the Creeks, rivers, inlets &amp;c making into the Sea with great facility. Their proximity to the most densely populated and Central portion of the Territory, and the ease and Secrecy with which they may approach in to the midst of the Settlements by ascending the rivers in their canoes has induced me to adopt measures for their removal or expulsion from this Section of Country although I have not heard of any act of hostility being committed by them. As this can not be done alone by a land force as they would be able readily to defeat pursuit by resorting to Their Boats, and as the Shallowness of the water on the coast will not permit a vessel of any Size to be employed I have made application to the Commanding Officer of the West India Squadron and of the Navy Yard at Pensacola for a detachment of boats to Cruise along the coast and up the river &amp;c. to intercept their retreat. I will in the mean time however cause them to be communicated with through an interpreter, and if found to be friendly will cause them to be accompanied by a force Sufficient for their protection to Tampa Bay for the purpose of being embarked. The Sum of three Thousand Dollars has been advanced by the Receiver of public money's at this place for the furnishing and provisioning the Florida volunteers.

<docbody>Head Quarters Florida Volenteers SIR Having heard of the distress and I aha alarm on this frontier occasioned by Indian depridation, I raised a detachment of 250 Volenteer mounted rifle men from my Brigade and under the orders of the Acting Governor proceded to this border, where I found about the same number of men under the command of Col" Warren of the East Florida Melita. I have assumed command of the whole making my force about five hundred men. They were raised however for only four weeks, and many of them are badly armed and equiped. The services of these Troops have been tendered to Gen Clinch, and accepted for the prospect of protecting the frontier, I eah I can Sir scarcely give you an adiquate discription of the frontier Inhabitants. The whole country between the Suwannee and the S* Johns Rivers for the distance of fifty miles above the Indian boundry is abandoned, the fronter inhabitants shut up in a few miserable stockade forts and the Indians traversing the Country at will burning &amp; distrying where ever they appear. Before my arrival a number of scrummishes had taken place in which the Indians were invariably successful. A few days since a Detachment of Col" Warrens command while on their march in the margin of the Alachua Savannah, was attacked by a party of Indians. His baggage guard was defeated and his baggage captured. Two days after I marched on the same ground, recovered one waggon a carryall and the greater part of the baggage, I had intended to Camp that night at a house within one mile of fort Defyance Formerly called Micenopy where there was a supply of corn &amp; fodder. when my spies and advance guard approached they observed a house on fire they pressed foward and found the trale of a small party of Indians leading into a thick hammock they gave pursuit and drove them into a hahameek pond in which there was a thick undergrowth and a number of trees in which a htthaber ef the Indians were concealed. The volenteers lead by Col" Read the Brigade Inspector galantly entered the water and fought most bravely at half pistol shot as long as an Indian or the flash of his gun could be seen when the fight was over we found but four of the enemy killed. my loss was four wounded among these was Capt" Lancaster of the first Redgment and George Johnson of the 2"Redg” of Volenteers while fighting bravely in the front of the action. They were are all doing well except one of the privates whose wound I fear is mortal. I have this moment received an express informing me that the Indians have crossed the Suwannee River and are now burning and distrying at the the old town. Many of my men are drawn from that quarter and a short distance beyond it. They feel much alarmed for the safety of their famelies and I much fear many of them will leave me to night I assure you sir the country requires immediate protection and it can not be given too promptly.

<docbody>SIR Can you, by any possibility, spare from your port, for a short time, the Revenue Cutter under your charge. We are threatened with an attack of hostile Indians that will approach us by the coast and sound and our only hope of defence is to guard the shores, which, by land, we might do to some extent, but by water, we are wholely unable. I have been called on officeally, by several assemblages of people in the different towns and public places in this district, to bring this arm of service into requisition and can only do it through the good disposition of my brother Collectors who have the Cutters under their charge A large body of Regulars &amp; volunteers have marched to the Indian Country about 150 miles south and east, but I am of opinion they will not effect much as the Indians will fly to the swamps and marshes where troops cannot go, and from their places of concealment will occasionally come out and do much mischief.—They will also try to escape along the coast, which, it is very desirable, for our safety, to prevent. Do render us whatever assistance you can. If you you send the Cutter, direct her to this port to me—she shall be sent back when you direct 87 Yrs Respect” (Signed) JESSE H. WILLIS</docbody>

<docbody>SIR In consiquence of the recent hostile disposition of the Seminole Indians in this Territory, I have determined to make a temporary removal of my family and residence from this place to Tallahassee, about 15 miles distant, and in the midst of the settlements, where protection can be afforded them in case of necessity. Under ordinary circumstances I should have consulted the department, and have obtained its approbation of this measure before I acted, but I consider both my family and my office in danger from the peculiar situation of the place on the frontier settlements, and to wait the tedious transit of the mail to and from Washington City to obtain its approval might involve me in irretrieveable difficulties. The Indians have fully made known their hostile intentions by refuseing to comply with the terms of the treaty made for their removal the limitation of which has expired, by killing all white persons who come in their way, laying waste and burning plantations and houses. The loss of lives and property has already been great, and their ravages have just commenced. Their success in two engagements seems to embolden to further depredations. They are represented to have two thousand warriers in the field, and altho will not allow themselves to be brought into fair array. They will nevertheless fear, for sometime to come, do vast damage by Sallies from their numerous hideing places upon the coast. All the families of the place that are able have left it for more tranquil abodes, and under the peculiar circumstances of the case I am confident mine will not be made an exception by the act of the department So soon as a better state of things exist, they will resume their residence at the port of Entry. The office, will of course be continued at Magnolia with such papers laws &amp;C. (except those which for safety I will also remove) as is necessary for its business, the duties of which in my occasional and necessary absence in attending to the requisits of my family, will be performed by a Competant and faithful deputy I have the honour to be Very Resp.

<docbody>MY DEAR GENERAL I write; and proscribed as I have been, I will still communicate the truth; under the conviction that the truth, and the Authority will meet with the respect it was wont to do—If it does not I have done my duty to myself, you &amp; my Country and stand acquitted before my God for the faithful fulfillment of them—It is no longer to be concealed therefore, and without casting censure anywhere, I must say that we the People of Florida are in a most distracted and distressed state—We are literally without a Government; without concert of action, or receprocity of good feeling, a universal distrust seems to pervade the whole Community—Without Those who are officially cloathed with power acting in concert, all seem distracted in the general cry of something must be done, while all oppose every measure which can be suggested—We are literally like a Ship tossed on the waves of an angry Ocean, without a helm, the Mariner asleep, and the crew divided among themselves—This is no exaggerated picture; nor it is communicated with any other view than that you may bring us out of the difficulties into which we have been thrown—I stand myself but a spectator of scenes in which I have not participated; though still ready, as I ever have &amp; ever shall be, to peril my life in the service of my Country—But that spirit of proscription; which has directed its shafts even against the humble writer of these lines; has made him an object even to be shunned by all the Public officers you have sent here, and thinking they cannot do a more acceptable office to you; they avoid the Counsel, or aid of him whom you have pronounced unfit for Station—Be it so; I feel not the less for my Country &amp; my home, Everything I hold dear in this world is in this Territory, &amp; I regret to see it brought to the unhappy condition in which it now is—I would Cheerfully render any service &amp; stand prepared to do my part with those who in the performance of duty look to the general good and not to individual agrandisement—But enough of this—To the Facts—The Army of volunteers &amp; Regulars have met the Enemy at the Withlacouchey &amp; after a sharp contest for one hour seperated, as it were by consent—The Army retiring to their old Camp at Lang Syne, &amp; the Indians remaining on the field of Battle—Since which the Volunteers have returned home leaving Clinch with his regular force reduced 40 or 50 by death or wounds in position on the frontier—In the mean while the Indians have been encouraged &amp; have burnt &amp; destroyed the whole country to the St Johns River—In this quarter since the return of the Volunteers we have been standing still: nothing doing &amp; no probability of an adequate force volunteering for service— Indeed, I doubt much whether anything will or can be done by us;—&amp; therefore we look with deep solicitude to the General Government with a hope that some decesive &amp; efficient measures will be taken at Washington—I fear from present appearances that the Conquering the Indians &amp; removing them from the Territory; which will be a necessary consecutive to the first, will now require time &amp; the presence of an Active force of Mounted Rangers to cooperate with Infantry &amp; Riflemen—I therefore previously suggested &amp; again invite your attention to the subject of a Regiment similar to Dodges " Rangers to operate on the Florida &amp; Creek frontier, untill the Seminoles be subdued &amp; both Creeks &amp; Seminoles finally removed from the Country— Something of this kind will be necessary—The People here cannot leave their business, or will not voluntarily to fight the Indians—At all events those who would volunteer would be too small in numbers to effect the object— Thompson the Agent I presume you have heard has been killed &amp; the whole country of Tomoka, Lower Allachua, &amp;c Destroyed &amp; laid waste—The Peopel of the East are in a truly deplorable state &amp; something must be done &amp; that speedily to relieve them— Yours &amp;c JAMES GADSDEN [Addressed] Andrew Jackson President U.

This to be answered regrets the Spirit with which it written—there has been no proscription by me unless on the nullifiers, who it would be highly improper that the Executive should appoint to execute the laws when their influence is using to nullify them—ample &amp; prompt means have been adopted to put down this punic war, waged by a few desperate Indians, not more than 500 gunmen—by Col Clinch and the militia of Florida, within twenty days after the first murder—we have given long Since authority to Clinch,” first to call upon the Govr of Florida for as many troops as would put a speedy end to the conflict—then on Alabama Georgia, &amp; S" Carolina,” three revenue Cutters, Sloops of war &amp;c.," &amp; have Sent Genl Scott to take the command” &amp;c. &amp;c— </docbody>

<docbody>MA” J. D. GRAHAM Top Eng Pensacola SIR, The exigencies of the service in Florida has made it necessary to order every Officer, on detatched duty, and who belongs to the troops in that quarter, to join their respective companies without delay. Four of your Assistants have been accordingly removed, and among these are Lieutenants Stockton and Henderson. This will deprive you of the means, of doing more at present in reference to the Road from Pensacola to Columbus, than the reconnoisance upon which you are now engaged." As it is presumed this will soon be completed, I have to call your attention and to direct your service, in the execution of a law of Congress in reference to the opening of a road from the Alabama line, through Mariana to the town of Appalachicola.” Inclosed you will receive the maps, and copies of the reports and laws in reference to the subject. As there does not remain more than 9.000 dollars of the appropriation to be expended in the opening of the Road, you will limit your operations to that part of the survey which lies between Appalachicola, and the point where the survey is intersected by the road from the Head of St Andrew's Bay.” The object is to open a common country road, and the appropriation being small, it is not supposed, that you will be able to give any attention to ditching, or to the construction of bridges, but that you will have to confine yourself merely to the cutting out, or in other words, to the removal of the timber and undergrowth from the width of the road. In the execution of this duty you will be governed by the following rules: 1* Sandy parts—these requiring shelter from the sun, will be thirty feet wide. 2" Clay or damp parts—These requiring exposure to the sun will not be less than sixty feet wide. 3" No Stumps to be left above the surface of the road, the small growth to be cleared out also, and no refuse from felling of timber, cutting or grubbing, to be left in the width of the road. The work must be done by contract, and no money will be paid for the same or any parts thereof, but on a certificate as required by the law. Funds in order to enable you to make the necessary payments will be transmitted to you, and for which you will make timely application. It is extremely desirable that this subject should receive your early and energetic attention. I am &amp;c (Signed) J. J. ABERT L* Co T.E. </docbody>

<place-time><location>PENSACOLA W. F. Jam:</location><date>28</date><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>HON: JOHN FORSYTH DEAR SIR! Allow me to draw your attention to a subject in which I have some interest, and in which, I look for justice, chiefly through your Agency. Congress has thought proper, for the last two years, to withdraw from the Judges of Middle and West Florida the extra allowance, for determining Land Claims, to which, under existing Laws, they were, in my Opinion, entitled. The Act of Congress of 26* May 1824 * (and which is made applicable to Florida, by subsequent enactments)" makes it imperative upon the Judge of the District Court of Missouri to adjudge certain Land Claims, and allows him $800 per Annum, in addition to his salary. In Florida these duties were required, and the extra allowance made to all the Judges untill the Session of 1833,” when it was witheld from me &amp; the Judge of Middle Florida, while it has continued to the Judges of the Eastern &amp; Southern Districts. It is true, that in East and South Florida, more of the Land Claims remained to be adjudicated than in West or Middle Florida, but because the Judges of these two Districts had been more rapid in their decrees, it was no reason why, having gone through most of these Cases, they should have been put upon a worse footing than the other two Judges. Besides, in West as well as in Middle Florida, Cases of this kind have never ceased to be upon the Dockets of the Court, and to this Moment, there are Cases in my District, upon which, I am called, at each session of the Court, to make some order. I cannot, for a Moment, believe that the Government or Congress wishes the Officer of the Law to perform duties without paying them a fair Compensation for their services, and must Conclude, that the witholding the extra allowance, hitherto, from the Judges of Middle and West Florida, by Congress, was from want of due information. I ask for this Additional Compensation, not only because I think that I have a right by Law to receive it, but because my ordinary duties are so disproportionate to the ordinary salary which I receive. Judge Reid has arduous duties to perform, and he richly earns every Cent that he receives from Government, and more: yet Judge Reid has not half the travelling that I am Compelled to perform—he has not as many Courts to attend, yet besides his regular salary &amp; his extra allowance he is allowed by Congress upwards of $1500 a year for Office rent, Clerk hire &amp; translator. Judge Webb has only one Court to attend, besides the Court of Appeals, yet he receives his ordinary salary of $2000, together with his extra allowance of $800. Pray, cast your eyes upon the Map of Florida &amp; look at my District! I have to hold Courts in five Counties, twice a year, besides on yearly term of the Court of Appeals: my travelling is more than 2000 Miles in the year I am from home, on my official duties, more than 6 Months in the year: from the nature of the Country &amp; the distance of my Courts, my travelling is not only great &amp; fatiguing, but my health and even life are often hazarded. And yet, for this I receive the salary of $1800 only, without any perquisites or allowances. Such inequalities should not exist. I beg you not to suppose, for a Moment, that I am objecting to the salary of Judges Reid and Webb; far from it: they receive no more than what they are justly entitled to, and yet, with due deference, I should think, that Congress should do justice to the other Judges. If you see this Matter in the light in which it presents itself to me, I hope you will suggest to Congress to make an Appropriation whereby I shall receive, at once, $1600 for the years 1834 &amp; 1835, and $800 for the year 1836 to be paid quarterly, with the ordinary salary. I am much obliged to you for the interest you have manifested in getting a Warrant for my son at West Point. I was much mortified that the [MS. torn] has made his rule to operate upon my son, (the rule to exclude all who were not 16 years of age) while others were admitted under 16. However, it is best perhaps, as it is, and by Another year, the reason will not prevail—my son will be better prepared—and I hope, he then, will find no difficulties to his Admission. I pray you to accept Assurances of the very high regard with which I have the honor to be Your friend &amp; mo: ob: s” J. A.

<docbody>W. A. WHITEHEAD. Esqr. Collector. Key West, Florida. SIR, I have received your letter of the 15th instant," conveying an account of the state of things in the Southern part of Florida, and at Key West. Major General Scott has been ordered to the theatre of hostilities, with full power to employ as much force as will be necessary to subdue the Indians, and to remove them immediately from the country. I am sure he will push his operations with great promptitude and vigor. And I trust the difficulties in that quarter will soon be terminated, not again to recur. I understand from the Secretary of the Navy, that Commodore Dallas has reached Key West, and that he has avowed his intention to remain there, in order to afford you the necessary protection. In the meantime I have requested General Scott" to detach a garrison to reoccupy Key West, as soon as he can do so. I have also directed the Ordnance Department, to forward without delay, 150 stand of arms, together with the necessary ammunition, to the direction of the Commanding Officer, if there is one at Key West, and if not, to your care."

<docbody>SIR, In consequence of the nomination of Judge Randall not having been made in due season, an entire term of the Court of Appeals has been lossed to the Territory of Florida. This combined with the circumstance that few cases were decided at the term before the last, and the fact, that the Court only sits once a year, has produced serious embarrassment in the Territory. To remedy this as far as practicable I have proposed a Bill to authorize a special term on the first Monday in May. I have just learned 14 NA (WD, SW Reg. of Lets. Recd., W97), text not found. 1* See the Secretary of War to Scott, Jan. 21, 1836 (NA, WD, Sec. War Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 18; printed, A.S.P., Mil. Affairs, VI, 1043–1044), ordering Scott to assume command of the troops in Florida Territory, together with instructions. Scott arrived at Augusta, Ga., Jan. 30, at Savannah on Feb. 9, and at Picolata, Florida Territory, Feb. 21, 1836, which was the date he assumed command of the Florida troops (ibid., VII, 223, 231, 238). The volume cited contains a vast quantity of relevant correspondence (pp. 125–366) which was utilized by the Military Court of Inquiry into Scott's conduct. that the Commission of Judge Webb will expire about that time. I most respectfully solicit, that the nomination may be made immediately so that it may be acted on &amp; the Judge notified thereof in time for this extra term. I believe Judge Webb has given universal satisfaction in his District, and suppose there will be no objection to his reappointment.

<docbody>TO GEN THO" S. JESUP, Q.M. General, SIR, In the 2" day of December ultimo, I received orders from Gen.' Clinch, to proceed with “D” Company 2" Artillery to the Indian Nation. The order was given on the 2" to march on the 3' by great exertion I succeeded in obtaining the necessary means of transportation. It however left me, no time to settle anything relative to the two appropriations under my charge, to wit: The appropriation for “repairing the Military Road, from Tallahassee to St: Augustine F*”” and the appropriation for “Clearing out the Ocklawohaw River.”” On my departure I left a party of 35 men in charge of my assistant J. Haslain at work on the road between Picolato &amp; St. Augustine, with instructions to prosecute the work agreeably to instructions which I had previously given him, until the 31* of December'35, at which time I directed him to close the accounts as far as possible, without my presence. A few days after my departure for the Seminole Territory, the excitement and alarm became so great, that all the hands I had at work, were ordered into the Military Service by the Gen' commanding the district, thereby breaking up the Party, of which I was immediately notified by my assistant. I have however, in consequence of the duties which devolved on me, on my arrival at this post, been unable to visit St. Augustine, for the purpose of settling the accounts— A visit of a few days will at any time enable me to close them—and the first opportunity will be seized for that purpose. Relative to the appropriation for the Ocklawahaw River—I made the necessary arrangements early in November for all the necessary machinery Tools, &amp;c. and provisions for 50 men for 4 months to be shipped to Palatkia on the St. Johns River—Previous to their arrival, the Seminole Indians commenced hostilities and on the 4” of December I was fortunate in intercepting the Steamboat at Picolata, with all the above articles on board, and caused them to be landed and stored at that place, instead of allowing them to be carried up to Palatkia, which place was burned by the Indians a few days after. Had they been taken to Palatkia they would have all been sacrificied— I had in November received 3 lighters, at Palatkia (built by contract) for the work. They were left at Palatkia in charge of the gentleman inhabiting that place—but since the Desertion and burning of that place, I have little hopes that they have escaped—However I have received no definite information since then relative to them, as the river above Picolata is entirely deserted. I should have commenced the work on the 15" of December, had these unfortunate difficulties not arisen—It has in consequence been entirely out of my power to render returns relative to either of the above appropriations, and with a knowledge of my situation, I must throw myself on the indulgence of the Department. So soon as these difficulties are ended, I hope, should I retain my scalp to the end, to prosecute the above works, with the approbation &amp; to the satisfaction of the Department. Lieut Heintzelman reported to me for duty in the Q Masters Department in the early part of January, and in consequence of the unsettled state of the country—I directed him to take the post at St. Francis Barracks, St. Augustine and await for further orders. All of which I hope will meet the approbation of the Department.” I am very respectfully Sir, Your obt servant F. L. DANCYLieut &amp; A A Q Master Sup, the Mil.

<docbody>DEAR SIR.—I found it was impossible to create a fifth Judicial District in the Territory of Florida. There is but one Marshal and District Attorney in either of the other Territories, and we have four. In nearly all the other Territories which have heretofore been organized, there has been but one Court held for the whole Territory at the Seat of Government; which, suitors and jurymen are obliged to attend at the distance of 300 miles. The practice of having Superior Courts in every County, was never permitted in any other Territory before ours. The Judiciary expenses in Florida, exceed that of any other's, more than 30,000 dollars a year. Under these circumstances, although we obtained the favorable report of a committee last year,” it was impossible to hope for the passage of the bill. Indeed I ascertained that the committee would not even report it again this year, being composed of different members—They considered that such was the extent of the Western District, and the great necessity of the Judge remaining at Pensacola longer in each year than such an extensive circuit would permit, in consequence of its being the rendezvous of our navy, and an important maratime port where a Court of Admiralty should always be open, that the next best thing that could be done would be to add the county of Franklin to the Middle Judicial District, and dispense with two terms in Hamilton and Madison.” This I trust will ensure regular terms at Appalachicola. I am very respectfully, Your obedient servant JOS. M. WHITE. To WM. WILSON, Esq. </docbody>

If you have any Communications on the subject, I have to ask the favour of you to send them to me. And if not, to say whether you think $20,000 sufficient to repair the roads. If you can send me something in a letter, having the appearance of an estimate, there is every disposition to put the sum in the regular appropriation. If you can drop me a few lines in a short time I shall be much obliged to you.” With great respect Your Mo Ob"S" JOS. M. WHITE To Maj. Gen" T.S. Jessup &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c [Endorsed] 61 Hon. Jos. M. White Washington February 17, 1836. The roads are out of repair but will probably be repaired by the troops—I have no information of the destruction of any bridges except that over the Ouithlacoochy—I have no doubt that others have been destroyed, but we cannot expect to receive information of the extent of the destruction until the troops shall have commenced operations—The appropriation for suppressing Indian hostilities can be applied to the repair of both roads and bridges while the troops are in the field. It might be well to obtain a special appropriation for the purpose—I &amp;c Received February 19. 1836 </docbody>

<docbody>HON. JOSEPH M WHITE House of Representatives D" SIR By this conveyance you will receive a petition to be presented to Congress, signed by a large number of the male citizens of what was formerly Monroe County, but which by the last Legislative Council has been divided, constituting now the Counties of Monroe &amp; Dade; remonstrating against the multiplication of expenses, duties, inconveniences &amp;c arising from the measure,—praying Congress to interfere, and by annulling the law, to reinstate them in their former privileges and circumstances— You will doubtless imagine that we must be but badly represented in the Territorial Legislature to require so repeatedly the action of Congress to prevent the execution of laws unnecessary—inexpedient and burthensome to the people.—That we are so is not the fault of those who reverence the laws that tend to the well-being of society and which are calculated to improve the condition of this portion of the Territory; and unfortunately, the Legislative Council are too prone to listen to petitions and memorials that have been secretly prepared without considering the effects that will result from the operation of the laws based upon them. So long as this continues to be the case, the aggrieved must trust to the wisdom and Justice of Congress for the necessary supervision over their rights and privileges in order that they may be protected in the enjoyment of both.— The memorial that went on to the Council for the division of the County, was not signed, so far as I can learn, by one person residing this side of Indian Key:"—or in other words, by any one who would not be immediately benefitted by the measure; and without the knowledge of the great body of the people inhabiting the County was sent to Tallahassee and received the attention of the Legislature before any steps could be taken to oppose it—This alone should operate against the division, but the people have more substantial reasons as you will observe on reference to the petition— Our mutual friend Judge Webb was at Tallahassee at the time the bill was under consideration, and knowing the great difficulty which has always attended the obtainment of Jurors, suggested to a member the propriety of making the Jurors of either County competent Jurors in the other.—An amendment of the kind was presented but objected to as it would “defeat the very object of the bill”— If such is the fact, the “object of the bill” must be to put an end to all criminal trials and important civil causes in the whole Southern District;—making this the theatre for the performance by every villain who may choose to profit by the circumstance—of every crime and misdemeanor without his being made to suffer the penalties of any law.— Being yet unprovided with a copy of the law, we cannot point out its particular provisions. We are however, satisfied that such a bill has passed and whatever may be its nature, so long as it operates to effect a division of the County of Monroe as formerly established, is uncalled for by the necessities of the people and contrary to the wish of a large majority;—calculated to benefit a few at the expense of the many;—and is subversive of the good of society by rendering it more difficult if not entirely impossible to punish wickedness and vice within the District.—Under these circumstances it becomes the duty of every good citizen to procure if possible, the disapprobation of Congress to the Act, and I feel no hesitation in calling for your aid to effect the desired end.— The contents of this letter you may make use of to attain the object had in view, to as great an extent as your prudence &amp; discretion may prompt *— Very truly Yours— W.

<enclbody> To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled— The petition and remonstrance of the undersigned, inhabitants of the Counties of Monroe and Dade in South Florida, respectfully represents that, the County of Monroe as formerly established, comprehended the chain of small Islands along the Florida Reef and a part of the main land:—that the principal body of the inhabitants of this County was, and is yet to be found at Key West: a few families only, residing in the vicinity of Cape Florida and a few more upon the Islands most of which are still uninhabited:—that there has always been a difficulty in obtaining a competent number of legal jurors for the civil business of the Court in this District, and after excluding the grand jurors and twenty allowed by law for peremptory challenges, it has ever been found impossible to enter into a criminal trial for capital offences:—that by law the Superior Court for this District holds two sessions per annum at Key West for jury trials: and owing to the length of the County, and the fact that all legal jurors were called on at every term, the jury duty has been extremely burthensome, taking those who lived at a distance from the place of holding Court at least one twelfth of the year from their homes and employments.”— Yet the Legislative Council of the Territory at their last session have passed an Act dividing Monroe County, so as to set off Indian Key” and the settlements east of it as a new County to be called Dade, and ordering two terms per year of the Superior Court to be held at Indian Key.—This will double the Jury service, already oppressive, if indeed any business can be transacted in Court: for if all the jurors of the District are not assembled, no criminal business whatever can be transacted.—We fear that several matters now on the calendar, must be dismissed to the detriment of the public morals if the present division of the County continued.— Your petitioners would respectfully state that had it been known an application for a division of the County was pending before the Council strong opposition would have been made to the passage of the act.—They remonstrate against this early and unnecessary multiplication of Counties, as imposing on them needless burthens and expenses, which are not required for the public convenience.—The County of Dade as now established, will not embrace within its limits Ten families, even after those, who have fled from the main land on account of Indian hostilities shall have returned to their homes.—As Indian Key and all its buildings belong to one individual, the holding two terms of the Superior Court there per annum, may possibly benefit one man, but it will double the burthens of every other in both counties.— Your petitioners therefore pray, that the Act of the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida to establish the County of Dade in South Florida be disapproved and annulled by act of Congress, as being premature, inexpedient, and extremely oppressive to the people:—and they will ever pray &amp;c February 1836 Of Monroe County— A Gordon W.

I have presented this resolution in the House of Representatives and had it printed, and referred to the Committee of Commerce who will give to it such attention as it may be found to deserve.” The President has power under the Act of the 7" of May 1822.” to establish in Florida, Ports of delivery within any of the Districts established as Ports of entry, when in his Opinion the public interest may require it. By the 4" section of the Act aforesaid all the ports Harbors &amp; shores, from Charlotte Bay to Cape S" Blas, was established as a collection District by the name of Appalachicola. All the residue of the Ports, harbours, waters &amp; shores of Florida, Westward of Cape St. Blas, constituted Pensacola District. The entire Bay of S* Josephs is therefore in the Pensacola District, and as there will be much coastwise navigation to this new town, if it answers the expectations of its friends, I would recommend the immediate establishment of a Port of delivery at the town of St Joseph—And would recommend Robert Beverage Esqr as the Surveyor of the Port.

<dochead>PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF MONROE COUNTY</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:DS *]</source>
<place-time><month>March</month><date>1</date><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>To the Honourable the Congress of the United States. We the undersigned inhabitants of Monroe County, Territory of East Florida, crave permission to represent, That in consiquence of the great inconvenience &amp; disadvantage to many of us who reside at the north &amp; eastern part of this county, in being obliged to attend as Jurors at Key West twice every year at seasons when our presence is most required at our places of residence with no other means than small open boats to travel by water a distance of between two &amp; three hundred miles, subject to all the ill consiquences of exposure to boisterous &amp; disagreeable weather, with great hazard attending such a mode of travelling for at least ten days &amp; frequently owing to head winds exceeds two weeks. To alleviate our burthens the Legislative Council of this Territory during their last session passed an act to divide Monroe County, And while we felt peculiarly greatful of being thus relieved of so great a grievance, we did not for a moment entertain a doubt but that every man in this county would feel the same degree of gratitude.—And far, very far from our thoughts did we for once believe that any person or persons would manifest the least disposition or wish to abrogate such a law.—But to our great astonishment &amp; surprise a petition has been drawn up at Key West &amp; sent to the Honorable the Congress of the United States to have this Act repealed;* what motives they may have in desiring this law revoked we do not pretend to say, but it is to be feared that a due regard for the interest of the settlers in the remote part of the county is lacking. It is well known that this county is coming rapidly into notice, for the cultivation of sugarcane, sea island Cotton, Tropical Fruits, the Mulberry tree &amp; rearing the silk worm, to which the climate &amp; soil are both peculiarly applicable, perticularly at, and in the vicinity of Cape Florida, New River &amp; Indian River, and although the settlements at each of those places have recently been abandoned in consiquence of Indian incursion, twelve families from Cape Florida &amp; New River, and also twelve families from Key Vaccas have all fled to Key West for protection, Indian Key is the only settlement within the new county not abandoned, We have been able to keep our stand, with , our own inhabitants consisting of forty men under arms, and from forty to fifty men at our command that are attached to vessels owned at Indian Key, all of which men are residents of this county, &amp; qualified voters. And it is sincerely hoped &amp; fondly anticipated that the time is not far distant, when the red men will be obliged to give up their hostilities, and not only those who have left their homes will return, but many more will soon become settlers of this county. The boundaries of Monroe County before it was divided will we trust, be sufficient to prove the importance of having the Act alluded too, to remain unaltered—The line commencing at Boca Gasperilla the mouth of Charlotte harbour on the Gulf of Mexico and extending up the northern margin of said Charlotte harbour to the mouth of said Charlotte river, thence up the northern margin of said river to Lake Macaco, thence along the northern margin of Line to the head waters of Potomac river, thence down said river to its entrance into the Ocean, together with all the Keys and Islands of the Cape of Florida.—From the north eastern boundary of the County to Key West, is a distance of three hundred miles, from Key West to the western boundary is seventy miles. We therefore pray that the Act passed by the Honourable the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida for having Monroe County devided, may continue uninterrupted. INDIAN KEY Flor.

<place-time><location>No date,</location><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>To the honorable, The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress Assembled. The undersigned, inhabitants of Monroe County, in the Southern District of Florida, respectfully represent; That they are informed, that Jacob Housman, the proprietor of Indian Key, in said district, is causing petitions to be presented to your honorable bodies; praying that Indian Key may be made a port of Entry. The undersigned beg leave respectfully to remonstrate against the prayers of these petitions. They desire to state to your honourable bodies, that they reside upon the Southern Coast of Florida; that they are acquainted with its topography; its Commerce; and the wants and wishes of its people; and they deem the passage of a law establishing a port of Entry at Indian Key, impolitic, unnecessary, against the wishes of a vast Majority of its inhabitants, and as calculated to diminish the Revenue of The United States. The following, are among the many reasons for their opinion: By referring to the Chart of the Southern part of Florida, it will be seen that there is a chain of islands, extending from Cape Florida to the Tortugas; a distance of about one hundred &amp; Sixty Miles. These Islands vary in their distance from the Main land, from ten, to Sixty Miles. Their soil is generally sterile, and incapable of profitable cultivation. Their inhabitants, therefore, export nothing beside wrecked property, except live fish, turtle, and a little Salt, which is begun to be Manufactured at Key West. They subsist principally by fishing, turtling and wrecking; that is, saving vessels and cargoes that may be cast ashore upon the reefs. The entire population of these Islands, by a census taken in April last, was nine hundred and Thirty Two; of which number, about six hundred reside at Key West; and over two hundred at Key Vaccas. The Main land south of Tampa Bay, is entirely unexplored and unsettled; and must remain so for several years to come. Key West, situated about midway of this Chain of Islands, is already a port of Entry; and one port of Entry is deemed sufficient to supply the reasonable wants of the few inhabitants of these Islands. If another port of Entry should be deemed necessary for these Isalands, Indian Key is not the most suitable place for it. It has an area of only eleven acres, measuring to low water mark; &amp; excepting one small lot, occupied by the Inspector of the Revenue, it belongs to Jacob Housman. It has been settled twelve years, and it contains but one store, one Grog shop, one merchant, four families, ten white men and no more. It is openly exposed to the sea; and possesses little or no harbor, for vessels drawing over six and a half feet water. True, vessels drawing fifteen feet may cross the Reef and approach within a mile of Indian Key. But they are then in no other harbor than exists in a channel seven or eight miles wide between the reef and the Islands, which is always considered unsafe for merchant vessels; and the advantages of which are equally possessed by every island on the coast. There are more than a dozen better harbors, admitting larger drafts of water, among these islands. Bahia Honda, Key West and Tortugas are safe harbors, possessing deep channels and admitting from the sea the heaviest class of armed vessels. Key Vaccas possesses a better entrance, a safer harbor, more shipping, a greater population, as much business, and in our opinion, has greater claims to be made a port of Entry than Indian Key. The character of Jacob Housman, the proprietor of Indian Key, well known upon this coast, affords no guaranty, that a privilege of a port of Entry upon his island, will not be abused. In 1836 his share of the salvage on the cargo of the ship Ajax, wrecked on the coast, was forfeited by a decree of the Admiralty Court, on a charge made and proved against him, of embezzling a part of the Cargo. In the same case and at the same time, the salvage of a master of one of his wrecking vessels was deemed forfeited by the Admiralty Court, for embezzling and landing at Indian Key, a large quantity of valuable goods from the same wreck; which goods are unaccounted for, to this day. The records of our Admiralty Court shew these decisions unreversed,  and unappealed from. The records of the Court of Appeals at Tallahassee, show a decree made against him at the January term of 1838, for $8600, for confederating and conspiring with the master of the Schooner North Carolina, bound from Appalachicola to Charleston, to dispose of a part of his cargo at Indian Key, under pretence of paying salvage; by which they defrauded the owners and underwriters, and shared the spoils between them. Other, like instances might be rehearsed, but as they have never been the subjects of Judicial investigation and become matters of record we will omit them. The character of M* Housman as exhibited on this coast for a series of years, render it certain, that the public revenues, and public convenience will not be benefitted by establishing a port of Entry on his island. These facts are not stated from any hostile feeling towards Mr. Housman, but that Congress may be in possession of them, as necessary to be known, when the wishes of one man are sought to be gratified at the expense of the many. Again, Indian Key by the legislation of our Territorial Council, and on the application of M* Housman, has been for the last three years, and still is, placed beyond the reach and protection of the ordinary operation of law. By our law, grand and petit Juries necessary to accuse and punish for offences, must come from the county where the offences are committed. Dade County has been set off from Monroe, and Indian Key is in the new county of Dade, which does not possess men enough in its entire population to form a grand and petit jury. M' Housman combines in himself, the legislative, judicial and executive authority, as lord of his insular proprietory. - When the Southern or Tropical portion of Florida shall have been settled, a port of Entry may be required at New River, Cape Florida or at Charlotte's harbor. But a port at Indian Key, from its Geographical position, and on account of continued shoals between it and the main land which will admit the passage of small boats only, will not benefit the inhabitants, that may hereafter settle upon the main. One port of Entry is sufficient for the Islands; and to establish another among them on the possibility, that it may at some future period accommodate the inhabitants upon the main would be to forestall and embarrass the future action of Congress, and to act in advance of the developments and wants of the country. The commerce of these Islands as before stated is confined principally to wrecking. The salvors claim salvage upon vessels and Cargoes thus saved, and it is adjuged and decreed to them by the Admiralty court at Key West. This Court by a law of Congress is declared to be always open; and the judge is directed to reside at Key West. Thus the rights and claims of all persons, interested in the property, are submitted to the action of an able and impartial tribunal; with the right of an appeal to a higher Court. No such court exists at Indian Key. Allow the entry and landing of wrecked goods at that place, where there is neither a court, nor law to restrain the cupidity of the proprietor; and the undersigned submit to Congress, what security salvors, owners, or uderwriters can have, for their respective rights. True, the Legislature of Florida have ordered a superior Court to be held at Indian Key once in a year. But this will afford no adequate protection; And Congress will find that the expense of another Admiralty Court, must be added to that of the Revenue officers; all of which are useless; and are prayed for, to advance the interests of one individual and his paid agents. The undersigned have stated, that Indian Key, except one small lot occupied by the Inspector of Customs, is owned by M Housman. This fact, they are aware, has been differently stated by M Housman's agents to Congress. Recently several pretended deeds of conveyance of lots upon that Island, have been made, and a map drawn, showing several owners of lots &amp;" to be laid before the committee. The most of these deeds are revocable at the will of the grantor after two years, by the deeds themselves; or by a defeasance contained in some other instrument. Nearly all of them contain conditions, limitations &amp;" so that the land shall revert to the grantor, after the port of Entry is obtained; as the undersigned are informed and believe. The names of several persons are placed upon the map, as owners of lots, without their knowledge or consent. These are artifices intended to be practised upon the Committee and Congress. The undersigned affirm that there is but one bona fide proprietor of Indian Key, with the single exception above named; and, that the proprietor refuses to sell, or rent any portion of the island, that will favor any competition with him in his business as a merchant, and the owner and manager of wrecking vessels. The mass of the inhabitants upon the Southern coast of Florida are opposed to Indian Key being made a port of Entry— The wreckers are opposed to it, because they will be required in every case, where the master of the wrecked vessel so directs, to carry the goods they save, to Indian Key after it shall have been made a port of Entry; there to be stored, sold, and the salvage settled, at the will of M* Housman, without competition at sales; and without the restraints of the law. Many others are opposed to it, from principle alone; as being unnecessary in itself; as benefitting one man only; and at the same time injuring every other interest on the coast. The undersigned know that petitions with numerous signatures have been sent to Congress, praying for a port Entry at Indian Key. It is believed that there are more signatures to these petitions than there are men, in all South Florida. And it is known to the under- signed, that these signatures are, principally, of men who never inhabited the coast. In one instance it is known, that men, constituting a large expedition against the Indians, under the command of Lieut. Powel, of the U.S. Navy, signed one of these petitions at Indian Key, several times over, with different signatures, for a glass of grog each time. The undersigned deem it not only proper, but their duty, to call the attention of Congress to these facts and reasons, set forth against granting the petition of M" Housman and others. They can obtain the signatures of nearly the entire population of these islands, remonstrating against making Indian Key a port of Entry; but they deem the signatures of a few individuals, as vouchers for the facts stated, as more satisfactory to the committee and to Congress. All of which is respectfully submitted in the nature of a remonstrance against constituting Indian Key a port of Entry— JOSEPH ELZAURDI. O. O'HARA F. A. BROWNE A. GORDAN J. B. BROWNE T. A.

<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress Assembled, the Memorial of the Stockholders in the “Wacissa and Ausilla Navigation Company” in Florida, respectfully represents. That your Memorialists have been incorporated by an Act of the Legislative Council of Florida for the purpose of rendering the Wacissa river navigable from its source, to its junction with the Ausilla; * and thence to the Gulph of Mexico—and also to connect the navigation with the harbor of St Marks, if upon careful examination, such a work is deemed practicable, and adviseable. That the proposed improvements will be of great importance to the inhabitants of the Counties of Jefferson and Madison in said Territory; who are now compelled to transport their produce to Market, an average distance of forty miles over roads of the worst description, and little susceptible of improvement. Your Memorialists have engaged in this work with little expectation that as Stockholders they will receive much if any profit upon the money to be expended; but chiefly because this navigation will benefit them, as well as the other planters in the Country. Your Memorialists are all planters Citizens of Jefferson County.—Your Memorialists pray leave to state, that the source, and the whole course of the Wacissa river, until its junction with the Ausilla, is a continued swamp of some miles in width, grown up with Bay, Cypress, &amp; other productions of a Wet soil; forming a thick “jungle”; and your Memorialists doubt whether half a dozen white men have ever yet found their way through this swamp, which is to be made navigable. A map of the Country, prepared in the Office of the Surveyor General of the Territory, is herewith presented; which shews that all of Township four, in Range two South East—and all of Township four in Range three (except six sections)—And one half of Township three, and one third of Township two, in Range three—and six Sections in Township three in Range four, and the greater part of Township two in same Range, Consist of swamp, &amp; “impracticable to survey.” And from personal knowledge of some of your Memorialists, they state that the six sections surveyed in Township 4 Range 3, are too wet for cultivation, without a great expence of previous draining. Congress has heretofore made liberal grants of money, and of land, in aid of similar improvements in the Territories of the United States; and your memorialists indulge the hope that the work which they have undertaken, will not receive less favor. They therefore pray that Congress will grant to the Company, twelve Sections of land, with the right to locate the same in parcels of a quarter Section each, upon any of the lands in the Territory of Florida, belonging to the United States, and not reserved for public purposes. It is probable that the completion of the work undertaken by your Memorialists, will reclaim portions of the present “impracticable” swamp; and give value to land, which is now, not only, worthless, but noxious. And if the above prayer of your memorialists shall not be deemed reasonable, they trust that Congress will grant to them the lands described in this Memorial; &amp; which are to receive the benefit of their work. The Map will shew that very little of the land in this district of Country is considered worth the Minimum price of the Government; for little has been sold. The fact is that nearly all of the land which is not swamp, is poor pine barren. Your Memorialists, will ever pray &amp;" ACHILLE MURAT President FAY.

SIR, In consequence of the present state of things in Florida, the establishing of a Post Office at Picolata, on the Saint John's River in that Territory, is of much importance to the public interests, and accordingly the Quarter Master General respectfully recommends that one be established there, if consistent with the arrangements of the General Post Office Department, the mail to run twice a week from Saint Augustine, to depart immediately on its arrival at Saint Augustine; the distance is represented to be eighteen miles. The Officer of this department at Picolata, Lieutenant Dusenbery,” recommends that George Colt be appointed Post-Master, if an Office be established, in which recommendation the Quarter Master General JOInS. General Jesup has received a cut in the right hand, which prevents his writing, and I address you in conformity with his instructions (Signed) THO: F.

<docbody>SIR, The indifference which has been manifested in Congress to the appeal which has been made in behalf of the distressed inhabitants of East Florida, who have suffered by Indian depredations, in the desolating war now going on, requires that I, as their representative, should lose no opportunity of obtaining for them a just indemnification for the injuries which they have sustained, from causes over which they had no controul, and of the existence of which they were entirely ignorant. The pretext for receiving with coldness and indifference an application founded on justice &amp; humanity, is, that the Government is not responsible for acts done in open war. I deny that this insurrection of ruthless barbarians is to be put upon a footing with nations whose conflicts are preceded by declarations of hostility, to whom the international code can be made to apply. They have not been treated either in the theory or practice of this government, as independent foreign nations, but as dependent domestic Communities, in unequal alliance with the U. States. The Circumstances attending these transactions will shew, that with the causes out of which, this wide spread desolation has been created, were not in any manner connected with the people of Florida. They grew out of the Compact on the part of this Government, with which the people of Florida were not acquainted, and relying with implicit confidence that the Government itself would execute its own engagements, and protect the frontiers against those collisions which might arise in their fulfilment, they were not forearmed, because not forewarned, of the approaching danger. It is useless to dwell upon this painful subject, —It is enough to know that three entire Counties have been overrun &amp; destroyed, and their inhabitants reduced to penury and ruin. If these ruffian barbarians are to be treated as civilized nations; that this refined code may be applied to the exclusion of these claims, we have a right right to apply another principle of that code, by demanding of a Conquered enemy, as one of the terms upon which pacification is granted, that their property and a portion of their territory shall be surrendered to make compensation for the outrages committed. I respectfully propose to you in the first place, to apply to Congress for a complete indemnification, for the losses of these unhappy sufferers, or to instruct Maj. Gen Scott not to grant pacification, until the whole property of the Nation be surrendered as a fund to pay these claims, as far as it will go, and that they be required to surrender a portion of their lands west of the Mississippi to make up the deficiency. If, as it is represented, these Indians consider, that they have been unjustly deprived of 5.000.000 of acres of land in East Florida, and the inhabitants have suffered in Consequence of it, they are entitled to an indemnity, to the extent of the Value of the land, which will more than cover their losses. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your mo, ob" sev" JOS. M. WHITE HONB" LEWIS CASS, Secry of War. [Endorsed] 16615 March 1836. White Hon Jos. M.

<docbody>THE HON SEC. OF THE TREASURY SIR. The Barque Euphrates, of Bucksport, Maine, of which I am at present master, has been loaded and ready to sail for Liverpool since Friday last, a period of four days; but owing to the gross negligence of the officers of the Custom in this District, I have not been able until today to effect a clearance of the vessel. It is extremely difficult to load a ship with Cotton in this place, as we are compelled to lay seven miles below and lighter the cotton down; this of itself causes a delay attended with much expense, and in addition to this, the Indian troubles have operated to retard my progress: but having succeeded, after an unusual and vexatious delay, in getting ready for sea, I took several journeys from my ship to Magnolia, a distance of fourteen miles, in order to clear out, but the Collector was not there and the deputy Collector instead of being at his post had taken a journey thirty or forty miles into the interior. The Collector lives eighteen miles above Magnolia, which is the port of entry, and had likewise gone to Apalachicola. It is from no motive of personal pique against the revenue officers in this quarter that I lay my complaints before your department— their punishment would gratify no spirit of revenge, and certainly would not indemnify me for the delay—I feel bound to state this explicitly and further to acknowledge that I have received from Judge Crane, the Surveyor at this place, every attention which a prompt and gentlemanly officer could bestow; he, however, had unfortunately no power to clear vessels bound for foreign ports. This is my case— with a vessel of 247 tons burthen, and nearly 800 bales of cotton on board, with a crew upon high wages, and at a season of the year when expedition is peculiarly desirable, I am, by the palpable negligence of a salary officer detained here four days! Is there no remedy for me? Can an officer of your department compel a vessel to wait upon his private convenience, when the Charterer himself often pays for demurrage after having used his best endeavors towards despatch? Seventy five dollar per diem would not more than compensate me for the loss sustained by this detention, and I feel that I should be remiss in my duty as a faithful agent of the owners not to state these circumstances. May I request your early attention to this subject, and that you will reply to my enquiries by letter addressed to Edward D. Peters Esq of Boston, Mass, to whom I have forwarded a duplicate of this communication. With much respect I have the honor to be Sir, yr most obdt srvt.

<place-time><location></location><month>March</month><date>22</date><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>HON. JOSEPH M. WHITE. House of Representatives. SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 12th instant,” and have submitted it to the President, who has instructed me to communicate to you, this answer. In carrying out the policy which has been adopted, not less for the sake of the Indians, than for that of the Government and Citizens of the United States, it was found necessary to remove the Seminole Indians from Florida to the Country West of the Mississippi river. Their condition was the subject of investigation in both Houses of Congress; and documents received from yourself and other persons, demonstrated the necessity of their removal. Under these circumstances, a council was directed to be held with them; which was done, and a treaty concluded by Colonel Gadsden, the Commissioner, for the cession of their claims in Florida, and for their transfer to the Country West of the Mississippi.” This treaty was not negotiated with a view to the benefit of the Government of the United States only, but in pursuance of a general system of policy, and with a view to ensure the welfare of the Indians, and at the same time to promote the interests of the Territory. This explanation of the motives which led to the treaty, is given, to correct the misapprehension, which you seem to entertain, that an arrangement was made, by the General Government, for the cession of land in Florida, independently of the interests of the Territory. This Department has never had the slightest reason to believe that the Indians were unjustly deprived of their possessions in Florida. The reasons given by themselves, and contained in a communication made to Congress,” for not emigrating, are certainly very frivolous, and obviously shew, that they were aware of the nature of their engagements. The high character of Colonel Gadsden, and the publicity of the transactions of the council at Payne's landing, the appointment of a deputation, in conformity with the treaty, to visit and examine the Country West," the convention subsequently entered into by that deputation," which rendered the conditional arrangements, entered into at Payne's landing, absolute; and the agreements made, by all the influential Seminole Chiefs, with General Clinch, General Thompson, and Lieutenant Harris, in April 1835,” in which they renewed their pledges to remove, all shew, they fully understood the obligations they had contracted, and that there is no foundation for the representation that they had been unjustly deprived of their lands in Florida. You propose that application should be made to Congress for complete indemnification for the losses of the sufferers. If, as I presume, you mean, that such an application should be made by the President, I am instructed to say, the President does not think, such a measure should originate with him. It is a subject for legislative consideration. You farther propose, as another alternative, that “General Scott be directed not to grant pacification to the Indians, until the property of the nation be surrendered to pay these claims, as far as it will go, and that they be required to surrender a portion of the lands West of the Mississippi.” The hostile operations in Florida have been disastrous, and have excited much commiseration through the whole Country, and the conduct of the Indians has been without any justification. But such scenes, in a greater or less degree, have attended every Indian War, * See ante, p. 63, n. nor do I see any principle, peculiarly applicable to Florida, which would require compensation to be provided to her citizens, and would not, at the same time, extend to other districts of country ravaged in a similar manner. As to property, they have none, except the annuities payable to them, and their possessions West of the Mississippi. An act of Congress in 1796,” first established the principle, that, if any Indians, in amity with the United States, shall cross the boundary line, and commit depredations upon our citizens, the amount of the injury, under the circumstances stated in the act, should be ascertained, and an eventual indemnification guarantied by the United States. It was farther provided, that the amount, paid on this account, should be deducted from any annuity due to the proper tribe. The principle was embodied in the intercourse act of 1802,” and again in that of 1834." But it applies only, as you perceive, to Indians in a state of amity, and if it is to be extended to those tribes, committing open hostilities, that measure must be taken by Congress. It is to be observed, that only a portion of the Seminole Indians have been in a state of hostility. Many of them have not only remained at peace, but have aided our troops in their operations. Whether, under these circumstances, the annuity should continue to be paid, is a question not yet determined. As to the cession, by the Seminoles, of the district of Country provided for their residence West of the Mississippi, that measure cannot be adopted. They must exist somewhere, and if that land is taken from them, they have no place to remove to, and besides, it is in the Country set apart for the permanent residence of the Indians, and it is an established feature in the policy of removal, that no right of soil shall be acquired by the United States, or by White persons in that region, but that the Western boundary of Arkansas and Missouri, so far North as the Indian locations extend, shall separate their settlements from ours. If once a cession is obtained, and a white settlement formed in the midst of that district of Country, we may abandon all hopes of the permanent establishment of the Indians. Such propositions as you make, have never yet been acted upon by the Executive. And without entering into any consideration of the question, as to how far the general law of Nations ought to regulate our intercourse with the Indians during a state of hostilities, or the consequences flowing therefrom, and applicable to any pacification that may be granted I am instructed by the President to say, that he does not feel himself at liberty to introduce, by his own authority, any principle into the operations of the Government, so new and important as that suggested by you.” L.

<place-time><month>March</month><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled. The Petition of the undersigned Inhabitants of the City of S' Augustine in East Florida Respectfully sheweth; That at the commencement of the present Seminole War, when many of our Citizens had been called away on public duty—and those who remained were but scantily supplied with arms and ammunition, the defenceless condition of S‘Augustine became the subject of remark abroad; and of painful consideration at home. The lines on the north of the City—relied upon under the Spanish Dominion, as one of the important defences of the place having fallen into decay and presenting no means of resistance to an invading enemy— it occurred to many of your petitioners that the time had arrived when they should be repaired. That your petitioners were the more impressed with this belief, is, because the Savages had ravaged a large portion of the surrounding country and were in the immediate neighborhood of S*Augustine, manifesting as they had done a daring ferocity—new even in the Indian character—it was within the limits of possible contingencies, that, influenced by revenge, cupidity and the advice of their black counsellors, they might endeavor to find their way into the City itself; but, whatever might be the event, it seemed to your petitioners both necessary and proper to adopt every means within their reach, for defence. Accordingly a subscription was circulated and individual contributors were found, ready for the purpose of making the northern boundary of S*Augustine more secure against attack. The work went forward, the lines were repaired; an Avenue was cut out and levelled 30 feet in width, and about 2,500 feet in length; the Rempart was put in good condition, and a Parapet wall 5 feet high constructed; the old Ditch was made deeper; three Bastions repaired, and Stakes and ditches thrown around them; and a line of Pickets was extended from the extremity of the old works to the S. Sebastian River. The whole work thus accomplished by private Subscription is above 3.500 feet in lenght, and has cost 850 Dollars. These labors having been accomplished when they seemed to be most necessary for the general safety, and at a time of imminent peril, and being Public and not Private in their design and character, your petitioners humbly pray that your honorable body will cause an appropriation to be made for the payment and reimbursement of those who have appended their time, labor, and funds in the public Service and for the public benefit.” And your petitioners will ever pray, &amp;c P.

<dochead>PETITION TO CONGRESS BY THE TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA</dochead>

<place-time><location>TALLAHASSEE,</location><month>April</month><date>2</date><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>The undersigned, the Trustees of the University of Florida, beg leave to present to the Congress of the United States the following petition, showing: That they have had their attention for some time past drawn to the subject of education in the Territory of Florida, and to the wants of its inhabitants in connection with education. The result of their consideration of the circumstances of the Territory and its necessities in connection with education has presented to them the following particulars: First. Owing to the circumstance of the families being scattered over a large tract of country, the system of common schools, for the present, is not a practicable one as the children would necessarily have to travel too far to reach the location of their school-houses. This results in part from the fact that the country is as yet but thinly settled, and between the richer tracts of land which are occupied, and which are in themselves limited in extent, there are extensive and sterile piney-woods intervening, which will always render the population a scattered one. Again. It is believed to be a generally conceded truth, that all popular governments depend on the virtue and intelligence of the people, and that virtue and intelligence can be expected only as the result of a correct and efficient system of education. With this fact in view, the undersigned believe it to be greatly important to our people, that the best system of which the circumstances of the Territory will admit should be introduced at once, before our habits and institutions become too well established to be easily changed. And they are persuaded that the best, if not the only practicable system of education in the Territory is the establishment of a Seminary of learning in some favourable position of the Same, which shall induce the different families of the Territory to send to it their sons. The undersigned would further represent, that the present state of the Territory is such, that but little reliance can be had upon individual contributions in giving successful and permanent establishment to a general Seminary of learning in the Territory. The undersigned turn therefore to Congress, whose prerogative it is to legislate for the welfare of the Territories, and who have already with much liberality consulted their wants. In so doing, the undersigned at once find that Congress has already, with what is deemed to have been commendable fore thought, made provision for the establishment of a University in the Territory by reserving two townships of land, one in East and one in West Florida, which shall be devoted to such Seminary of learning when the Territory shall become a State.” But, as that period may yet be some time in the future—and as the wants of the Territory in connection with education are as great now as they then will be—and probably, considering her dependence, those wants at the present moment are still greater therefore, your petitioners desire that these lands may at once be rendered available for the benefit of the University of Florida of which the undersigned are the Trustees. They believe that Congress, by so doing, will by its act most successfully secure the designed end of the providing statute already alluded to, which was to promote education in the Territory, and thus, at once, give to the Territory the needed benefit of the most practicable system of education of which the present circumstances of the people will admit. All which is respectfully submitted and asked, and your petitioners will ever pray, &amp;c. R. K. Call Ben. Chaires John G. Gamble Turbutt R. Betton Thomas Randall Fitch W. Taylor Lois M.

<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States Your memorialists, settlers upon the lands in the district of country in the Territory of Florida commonly known as Forbes’ Purchase, most humbly and respectfully represent unto your honourable Bodies. That attracted as well by the benefits held out by the munificence of the government in the right of preemption to settlers upon the publick lands as by the advantages of soil and climate your memorialists were amongst the earliest settlers of Florida after the change of Flags; and believing the claim of Forbes &amp; co, would not be recognised by the government as valid after its rejection by the board of commissioners appointed to settle land claims under the Spanish treaty, and the decision of the Superiour Court of the Middle District of Florida adverse to their claim, Your memorialists have gone on to improve their settlements, encountering all the dangers, privations and expenses incident to the first settlement of all new countries under the confident expectation that when these lands should be brought into market by the government, their right of preemption would assure to them at the minimum price the certainty of a home for their wives and their children, and a prospect of remuneration for their labour and expenditures in making plantations in the wilderness. But the decision of the Supreme court of the United States confirming the grant of those lands to the Claimants has destroyed these reliances. and your memorialists are now required to become the highest bidder in the market for the labour of their own hands, or to abandon their homes and their fire sides and take up a pilgrimage again in the wilderness in search of another resting place for their families Your memorialists humbly petition your honourable Bodies to take into consideration the hardships of their case and to extend to them such relief as your sense of justice, and magnanimity shall dictate, And as in duty bound they will ever pray" Robert L.

<docbody>To the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress assembled.— The memorial of the undersigned, Citizens of the County of Franklin in the Territory of Florida, respectfully represent, that impressed with the local advantages of the newly established City of S" Joseph, and feeling satisfied that the public convenience would be thereby greatly subserved, they and others of their fellow citizens, comprising three fourths of the qualified Voters of said county, did some time since sign and forward a memorial praying the Legislative Council of the Territory to pass an Act, directing the Superior and County Courts of said County to be removed from Apalachicola to St Joseph.”— The Legislative Council did not hesitate to grant the prayer of so large a majority of the Citizens of the County in a matter so purely local, and the Act was accordingly passed.—Your Memorialists how- ever have recently heard that their Delegate in Congress, Col. Joseph M. White, not understanding the wishes of the Citizens of the County, and perhaps ignorant of the Act of the local Legislature above alluded to, has procured the passage of an Act of Congress not only directing the sessions of the Superior Court to be held in Apalachicola; but actually detaching the County of Franklin from the western, and attaching it to Middle judicial District.”—While your memorialists wish it distinctly understood, that to the Judge of the Middle District they have no objection—that he is a gentleman meriting their respect, esteem, and confidence, they would represent that the county of Franklin is situated on the West side of the Apalachicola river, and has ever formed a part of the Western District, that they have entire confidence in the qualifications, and integrity of the Judge of the Western District, and have no desire to be transfered to another jurisdiction—Your memorialists considering the questions purely local, in its character, in the decission of which, the wishes, and convenience of the people of the county ought alone to be considered— respectfully protest against the Transfer of the County of Franklin from the western; to the Middle District, and request their Delegate to lay this their Memorial before Congress, and urge the repeal of the Act of Congress, and allow that, of the Legislative Council to go into effect.*— Nicholas Beams Henry Moulton Robert Whipple Jno Derrick Richard Chapman Charls Steele Oren.

<docbody>Tomorrow I shall leave this place, join my family which is at Pensacola, &amp; by the way of N Orleans proceed to Nashville. I should have replyed to y letter of the 18 March" earlier; but it came here during the time, I had made a flying visit to Pensacola. All my matters of arrangement public &amp; private, being closed, there remains nothing to detain me longer in the Territory” You remark in your letter, that I had “expressed some astonishment, at Calls nomination being made before I was confirmed” I beg to say that you misconceived me entirely &amp; hence no explanation on your part was at all necessary, under the recollection of what I did say, for in writing to you, I never keep copies of letters. I only suggested that some difficulty might arise, with others (not myself for as you remark, I had not intended, under any state of things again to return to Florida What I thought I foresaw would happen, * House Journal, 24 Cong., 1 sess., p. 673.

When I see you, I will inform you of the little outlines I would do so now, but it is not of value &amp; importance sufficient to be written about I perceive by the papers that the Randolph lately burned at Nashville had much of your furniture for the Hermitage on board. I regret to learn it. It seems that fire of late has become your great foe Since the 26 March, the time that gen" Scott left Fort Drane, we are without information from the army. From the forces now in the field tho, I cannot immagine that the war can last many weeks longer I should like some little respite for &amp; on account of private affairs in Tennessee, before setting out for Spain. If matters important to the public require speedy action I am forthwith ready; but presuming it to be a mere interchange of national civilities, the sending a minister, is the reason why I make the suggestion.

<docbody>HON, J. M. WHITE, SIR, In complyance with your request, that I should express my opinion as to the propriety of abrogating the Act of the Legislature of Florida dividing the County of Monroe, &amp; establishing a Court at Indian Key, I have to observe, that I can perceive no injuries which will necessarily result from the Act in question, except such as may grow out of the impossibility of obtaining Jurors for the trial of important causes in the Courts of either County— Previous to the division, there were not more than One hundred persons residing within the limits of Monroe County, who, by the laws of the Territory, were qualified to serve as jurors; &amp; the consequence was, that even then, a difficulty was often experienced in procuring jurors for the trial of important causes.— Under the present arrangement, the Statutes intended for the prevention of crime, will be wholly inoperative in that section of the Country, &amp; had as well be stricken from the Statute book—By the Territorial law, prisoners, (no matter how aggravated their offences) are discharged from their crimes, if not tried at the third term after arrest; and as they will always be able to prevent a trial by availing themselves of their right of Challenge, it is not presuming much, to suppose, that they will in this way avoid punishment.— It is certainly true, that the people labor under some inconvenience in getting to the Courts, &amp; it would be gratifying to me, could they be relieved from that diff inconvenience without involving consequences, which would be much more injurious to them—At present however, I know but one way in which it can be done; &amp; that is, by increasing their Compensation for travel &amp; attendance on the Courts as jurors— With high respect Your Obd" Serv" JAMES WEBB [Addressed] Hon: Joseph M.

<docbody>HON, JOSEPH M. WHITE. House of Representatives SIR, Your letter of the 5th instant," was received a few days since at the Department, but I have been prevented, by indisposition, from giving it an earlier answer. The regulations, approved by the President, on the subject of the issues to the inhabitants of Florida, upon the joint resolution of February 1st, 1836,” were adopted upon great consideration, and on a reexamination of them, and a conversation with the Attorney General, * Senate Journal, 24 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 284, 296. See act approved July 2, 1836 (5 STAT. 69–70), transferring the trial of criminal offenders from the southern district to the eastern or middle districts if a sufficient number of jurors were unobtainable in the southern district. The same act vetoed the establishment of a superior court at Indian Key. I do not see that I can prescribe any more certain principles to carry into effect the object of Congress. Some discretion must necessarily be exercised by the issuing Officers, as, in a matter like this, it is difficult to prescribe rules which shall embrace all cases. You observe, that the resolution, referred to, was adopted in a spirit of liberality and generosity by Congress, and to provide subsistence for all descriptions of persons, who were driven from their homes, and, in consequence of the destruction of their property, by the Indians, left without a supply of provisions. There are two requisites, which, by this resolution, must be united in a person, before he can receive provision from the public stores. He must have been driven from his home, by Indian depredations in Florida. And He must be an unfortunate sufferer, unable to provide for himself. The first requisite is susceptible of direct proof, and, therefore, needs no consideration. The second, presents a more difficult question. I find, in adverting to the progress of this Resolution through the House, that, when first submitted, it did not contain any clause respecting the inability of the sufferers. It embraced all who had been driven from their homes by Indian depredations. An amendment was introduced and adopted, which declared, that they should also be unable to provide for themselves, and in this form, the Resolution was passed. Who then, are unable to provide for themselves? This question is met, as clearly as it can be, by the regulations. Nor does the President, to whom this matter has been submitted, see any reason to change his original views. From the particular state of things in Florida, there may be such a scarcity of provisions, as to render it difficult for any body, without great sacrifices, to procure them. Where this is the case, provisions ought to be issued, as it may be fairly construed to be such an inability, as is intended to be met by the Resolution. If, however, provisions are sufficiently abundant, and so reasonable in price, as to be within the reach of ordinary means, I do not think that a person, able by labor, to support himself, or possessed of such means, either in cash, in slaves, in land, or in other species of property, as will procure the provisions, or as will insure to him the necessary credit, by which provisions can be obtained, can be said to be unable to provide for himself. The Resolution does not, as has been supposed, refer to the cutting off of the ordinary resources or income of a person; but it makes his right to this aid to depend upon his actual inability to provide for himself. The commissary General will instruct the Officers of his Department, on this subject, in conformity with these views. You will see that something must be left to their discretion, and that the propriety of issuing provisions to persons possessed of property, must depend very much upon the state of the Country. If I am wrong in this construction, a supplementary Resolution, declaring more clearly the views of Congress, will, at once. afford the proper remedy.” L. C. </docbody>

<docbody>SIR I enclose you herewith a copy of a letter which I have just received from the Co" com" the Militia of Alachua County, from which it will appear, that while our Troops are marching and counter marching in the enemy's country, we are invaded by the same enemy. Only a few days since a body of 400 well appointed and equiped mounted men from Georgia, furnished on the requisition of Gen"Scott," after marching to the Depot on Black Creek in Florida, without being sent on any service whatever (as I am informed) were disbanded and ordered home. The Florida Volunteers a well organized and efficient Batalion of 300 men, was disbanded one month before their term of service expired, and the day after their arrival here I rec" an express informing me that the Indians had reappeared in considerable numbers, and were commiting depredations on our frontier settlements. It is evident that the enemy instead of retreating to the South before the several divisons of Gen" Scotts Army, merely evaded them and remained in their rear, ready to attack the frontier so soon as it should be left unprotected. Many of their warriors are already well mounted, and from their success in capturing horses as well from the Army as from our Citizens, they will be enabled in a short time to mount a formidable band. I have had no communication from Gen." Gains Scott since he marched from Tampa Bay but there is no hope of his bringing the war to a close with the forces now in the field. I understand he does not intend making another Campaign until the fall. In the meantime our frontier will be continually exposed to the Tomahawk and Scalping Knife, and the safety of our people requires the adoption of the most prompt and efficient measures for their protection. Mounted men alone will be effective in the performance of this duty, and our Citizens and their horses have both been so much harrassed with the war that it will be a very difficult matter indeed to procure any considerable number of either during the Summer. The line of frontier to be defended will be near three hundred miles in extent, and will require at least 500 horse men, to keep the enemy in check. I have ordered out one hundred from the Counties of Alachua and Duval, other companies shall be organized as soon as practicable, and held in readiness to march at a moments warning. The people of Alachua you will percieve from the enclosed letter have been compelled to seek protection in the Forts. They will not be able to return to their homes in safety during the Summer, and the Government will be compelled to supply them with subsistence. In this state of things I beg leave to recommend that the Women and Children should be removed to some place of safety where they can be more conveniently subsisted than at the little forts on the frontier. When this is done the men will more willingly engage in the service. In my last I mentioned that there were large claims against the Pay and Quarter Masters Departments which remain unsatisfyed. None of our Troops have been paid for their services, and many of our Citizens have furnished supplies for which they have received no compensation. I have to request that the necessary funds for this purpose may be forwarded without delay." I am Sir Very Respectfully Your Ob"S" R. K. CALL HONB' LEWIS CASS Sect at War [Endorsed] Gov. R. K.

<enclbody> DEAR SIR Intelligence has reached me from below that Gen"Scott, has retired with his Army to Volusia, The Volenteers are discharged and our frontier will be left in a more dangerous condition than at the commencement of the War The Indians have within a few days past spread themselves over the country, committing depridations upon the property of Our Citizens—they shot a man at Micanopy—have carried off 17 or 18 horses from Fort Drane under the eyes of the garrison—have taken is seen dailey in the neighbourhood of Spring Grove; Micanopy and other parts of the frontiers which indicate a large body of Indians dispersed in various quarters— The Regular Troops who will remain in the Country are considered inadiquate for its protection. The inhabitants below have fled to the Forts again; and some are removing to places more remote from danger; In fact unless you authorize the raising a Company of men to protect our frontiers the country will in all probability be abandoned, for our citizens feel very little security in committing their families and property to the protection of the Regular Troops. In this state of things I feel it my duty to request that you authorize the raising One Hundred men from East Florida for the protection of our frontiers * Your very respectfully F R SANCHEZ Col Commanding 6* Reg' FM </enclbody></enclosure></docbody>

<docbody>At a meeting of the Citizens of Gadsden County, convened at the court house in Quincy, on the 14th of May, 1836, to take into consideration the state of the country, and to adopt measures for the safety of the same, against our savage enemies, the Creeks and Seminole Indians, who have been, and are now committing depredations upon the property, and destroying the lives of our citizens: The Rev. Jesse Coe was called to the Chair, and R. H. M. Davidson was appointed Secretary. The meeting was addressed by the Chair man and Charles H. DuPont, Esqr. who explained the object for which they had assembled, when, on motion of C. H. DuPont, Esqr. it was resolved, that a Committee of seven, consisting of Charles Munnerlyn, James Gibson, Joseph M'Bride Daniel L. Kenan, Isham Johnson, Jason Gregory, Esquires and Dr. Thomas Munro, be appointed to report what measures, may be necessary to take for the safety of our Country. On motion of Colonel John C. Love, the Chairman was added to the Committee. The meeting then adjourned until half past 3 o'clock P. M. The meeting convened pursuant to adjournment and the proceedings of the morning being read, the following preamble and resolutions, were offered by the Committee, and unanimously adopted. “The Committee appointed in pursuance of the foregoing resolutions, having taken into consideration the matters submitted to them, and all the information they have been able to procure from the Creek nation in Alabama and Columbus in the State of Georgia, beg leave to submit the following resolutions:— Resolved, That in the present emergency, it be recommended to the people of this County, generally, both young and aged, to organize themselves into Volunteer companies, and arm themselves properly, and meet as frequently for the purpose of mustering, &amp;c. as may be requisite. Resolved, That it be expedient to procure all the information that can be obtained, relative to the hostile attitude and intentions of the Creek Indians, and the probable effect that their measures may have upon the people of this County, and that the Colonel of the 5th Regiment be requested to procure the services of such a number of Volunteers as may be required to carry this resolution into effect. Resolved, That whereas, there are some indications of a hostile nature, among the Indians on the Appalachicola river, it be respect- fully recommended to the Governor of the Territory to disarm those Indians, and take such other steps as he may deem necessary to preserve their neutrality. Resolved, That his Excellency, the Governor, be requested to place at the disposal of the commanding officer of the 5th Regiment, 200 stand of arms, with the necessary accoutrements, and ammunition to be distributed among the citizens of this County, in the event, that the present emergency may require it. Resolved, That Charles H. DuPont, Esqr. Dr. T. Munro, and Dr. M. Nichalson be appointed a Committee to memoralize the President of the United States, most respectfully representing to him our exposed and defenceless situation, between the Creek Indians on the one hand, and the Seminoles on the other, requesting him to take such steps in our behalf, as the present emergency evidently demands. On motion of Dr. T. Munro, the Secretary of this meeting was requested to forward a copy of these proceedings to the Governor of the Territory, R. K. Call, to the Floridian, Florida Intelligencer and the Evening Star, New York. On motion of Colonel D. L. Kenan, the meeting adjourned sine die.” JESSE COE, Chairman. R. H. M.

Whereas—an election was held on the first Monday in May 1835, for the election of a Deligate to the next Congress of the United States, for the Territory of Florida, And whereas at said election Joseph M. White, received a greater number of votes than any other individual, as appears by the Returns legally made to me—Now therefore in pursuance of Law, I do hereby proclaim the said Joseph M White, duly elected the deligate from this Territory, to the next Congress of the United States.

WALKER ExECUTIVE OFFICE Sept. 14th 1835 JOHN WALKER Chief of the Appalachicola Indians SIR Your letter of the 28" of July last " was received in my absence, and was not brought to my attention, until a day or two since. I hope that Before this time, all apprehensions of an interference with your Negroes has ceased, If such should not however be the case, I would advise you to remove them until the danger passes over to some place of safety, off the River.—Upon application to a Justice of the Peace in your neighbourhood, should an attempt be made to carry them off—every assistance will be given you that the Laws of the Territory can afford Respectfully Your ob" Sev" G. K. WALKER Sec. and acting Gov' of Florida ExECUTIVE OFFICE Sept 14* 1835 ALLIN H. BUSH Esq." SIR On my arrival at this place after an absence of some days I found a Petition Signed by several Gentleman of Jackson County, praying a remission of a fine imposed on M* John O. Seuell, at a Superior Court held in that County. And also a letter from Governor Eaton, and one from yourself on the same subject;” The case the Governor supposes himself to have acted on was that of Mr Nathans, I recollect to have conversed with him on this subject, and do not think it was his intention to have remitted the fine of Mr S. But I am not advised whether all the communications on this subject had or had not reached him. I regret that notwithstanding the Petition of the highly respectable Gentleman who have interested themselves in behalf of Mr. Seuell, I do not feel prepared to remit the fine. The pardoning power should only be exercised in cases of great hardship, when no doubt exist that the cause of Justice would be subserved by such interposition, and it should not be on slight grounds, that the verdict of a Jury, who are always supposed to be entirely impartial between the parties, and in such cases to be influenced only by a desire to promote the public peace and morals should be set aside, from all that has reached me on both sides of the subject, I can not regard it as a case presenting such claims for relief, I am therefore constrained to refuse the application I am Sir—very respectfully Your Obt. Servant. GEO: K. WALKER Sec: &amp; Acting Govt of Florida [September 24, 1835] To All and Singular the Marshals, and Sheriffs of the Territory of Florida:—Greeting Whereas it appears to me by a duly authenticated copy of an Indictment found by a Grand Jury of the County of Scriven of the State of Georgia. That Asael Farmer, stands indicted in said County of an assault committed on the Body of one Robert Bevill with intent to murder.

Payton, and having constituted themselves a body for the trial of said Negro, have proceeded to try and pass sentence of death on him and have ordered his execution on the twentieth day of the present month, Which proceeding are neither countenanced by Law nor sanctioned by any necessity known to exist, and are pregnant if not promptly arrested with incalculable evils to the community tending to the utter subversion of the supremacy of the Laws, the peace and good order of society and substituting in the place of the calm unimpassioned, and unbiased Judgment of the regularly constituted authorities of the Country, that of a self created tribunal, acting, as will ever be the case under the influence of popular excitement too strong to be withstood, and which if unchecked and arrestained, must create a spirit of recklessness subversive of all order and all Law. Now therefore the people of said County, and particularly the officers both civil and Military, and the commandant of the first Brigade of the Florida Militia, are hereby commanded to use all Lawful means to prevent the execution of said Negro, and to use the Military force of said County if necessary for that purpose and for the protection of said prisoner, while in Jail.

An express arrived at this place on the 6" instant bringing information of such a manifestation of the hostile disposition of the seminole Indians, as rendered in my opinion the employment of a part of the Military force of the Country necessary for the protection of the inhabitants residing near the Indian limits, through this source I learn that a principal chief of the Nation,” who had made known his determination of delivering up his property to the Indian agent employed by Government to Superintend the removal of these Indians, for the purpose of being sold preparatory to his removal was put to death by his people, and another chief averse to the emigration chosen in his stead, the habitation of the Indians in the vicinity of the United States, troops were immediately abandoned, and in two or three nighs afterwards, an attack was made by a party of Indians on a house of a white settler who though repeatedly fired on suceeded in escaping with his family, leaving his house to be pillaged, and destroyed by fire, the apprehension of the frontiers, is represented as being so great, that the people have deserted their homes, and collected together for mutual defence, the regular troops stationed in the nation consisting entirely of Infantry, and very limited in number, I regard as incompetent to protect so extinsive a line of Country, Their movemants must necessarily be Slow. and the Indians recede in the morasses &amp; swamps, may in small bodies penetrate into the settlements, lay waste the Country, and retreat to their hiding places, without ever being brought into action, under these circumstances, I have ordered a troop of three hundred mounted Riflemen to be immediately embodied and engaged in the protection of the exposed County, They are instructed not to enter the Indian limits, unless further hostilities are perpetrated on the white inhabitants, or in the event of the invasion of the Indian Country, by the U.S. troops, then their services shall be required by the commanding officer, I have received no communication from the U. S. agent stationd in the nation, or from Genl. Clinch the Officer commanding the troops on this subject But the numerous applications made to me by the most respectable sources in that section of Country, have satisfied me, of the necessity of these measures,—From all the information I received, in relation to the disposition of the Seminole Indians to comply with the treaty provided for their emigration, I have no doubt that nothing short of compulsion will induce them to do so. If this cause should be determined on, and the requisite force for this purpose, cannot be conveniently spared from other points, a sufficient number of Volunteers, can be raised in this Territory for that service I am Your obt, servant GEO. K. WALKER P. S. Since writing the foregoing an express has arrived from Genl Clinch, with communications copies of which are herewith transmitted. I have ordered Brigadier Genl R. K. Call, to take command of the Florida Militia Your Ob" servant GEO. K. WALKER Executive Office TALLAHASSEE Dec 9th 1835 D. L. WHITE SIR Please signify your acceptance or declination of the annexed commission on its Reception I am Your ob" sevant GEO: K. WALKER Head Quarters TALLAHASSEE Dec 6" 1835 To RICHARD K. CALL Comdg the 1" Brigd. Flor: Militia SIR. An express has Just reached this place bringing information worthy of Credit, of such acts of violence, and outrage committed by the seminole Indians as to have scarcely a hope that anything short of the display of an efficient military force will be adequate to the protection of that portion of our fellow Citizens more immediately exposed to their inroads. The population of that section of Country is represented as insufficient to curb or punish the Indian aggressors, and an appeal has been made to the people of Middle Florida, for assistance, This assistance I have deemed it my duty to grant, and have to request that immediately on the receipt of this order that you will cause to be detailed from your Brigade one hundred mounted Rifle men to be engaged in the Protection of the exposed Frontier In the discharge of this duty, you will not pass the Indian Boundary unless the frontier is attacked, or you are desired to Cooperate with the U.S. troops in active service against the Indians Very Respectfully Your obedient servant G. K. WALKER Acting Governor and commander in chief of the Florida Militia Head Quarters TALLAHASSEE Dec 12" 1835 To R. K. CALL Comdg, 1* Brig" Flo: Mil: Sir Since my order of the 6" Inst.” an express has arrived with dispatches from Bret Brig: Genl Clinch U. S. army comd" at Fort King. requesting the aid of the Florida Militia and communicating his intention of attacking the hostile party of Indians, as soon as he is in sufficient force to enable him to do this in the most effectual manner, you will proceed immediately with the force under your command to such point on the frontier as you may deem best suited, for Cooperating with the U. S. troops until you shall have communicated with the commanding Officer at Fort King you will take command of all the Florida, troops you may find in the field, and accept of such Volunteers as may tender their services, provided the entire force under your command is not permitted to exceed five hundred men. And you are particularly charged with the duty of causing to be arrested, and delivered over to the Civil Authorites, the Indians concerned in the murder of an individual engaged in carrying the U. S. Mail some time in the last summer Very Respectfully Your obedient Servant G. K. WALKER Acting Governor and commander in chief of the Florida Militia TALLAHASSEE Dec 15 1835. SIR I have just received the return of an election held in Jefferson County for officers of a company “to be entited “The Jefferson horse Guards” at which you were chosen the captain of the company proposed to be organized—The Laws of the Territory, not authorizing the existence of volunteer companies, it is out of my power to send commission for the officers elected I should be gratified however that this company should proceed to a perfect organization as it is possible their services may be required, and I have but little doubt that at the approaching Session of the Legislature, the present difficulty to commissioning the Officers will on application be removed. In regard to the Indians in the neighbourhood of the Fin A Halloway I am iformed from a source entitled to credit, that they are friendly to the whites, * Ante, p. 290. and that their disposition to comply with the treaty, provided for their emigration West of Mississippi has rendered them so obnoxious to the adverse party that it was thought necessary for their safety that they should retire from the nation. I will however for the quiet and repose of the Country cause these Indians to be removed within their limits as soon as it can possibly be done Very Respectfully Your obedient servant G. K. WALKER Acting Governor TO CLEMANT STEPHENS TALLAHASSEE Dec 16* 1835 TO THE COMD* OFFICER OF THE U.S. NAVY YARD Pensacola SIR. The facilities possessed by the Seminole Indians, who at this time occupy a hostile attitude to the people of Florida of escaping from pursuit and transporting themselves from point to point on our coast renders it highly desirable that a maritime force should be had for more effectual operation against them. I have therefore the honor to request that if in your power you will furnish such Naval aid as may be competent for this purpose. The character of force to be employed I have placed at the discretion of Lieu" Goldsborough whose knowledge of the coast Rivers &amp;c, in which it is proposed to engage it Qualifies him peculiarly for this duty, and point him out as a fit person to command the expedition. His appointment to this command would be highly acceptable to myself I am Respectfully Sir your obedint servant G. K. WALKER Acting Governor of Florida Head Quarters TALLAHASSE Dec 16* 1835 To THE SENIOR OFFICER of the 3" Regiment Florida Militia SIR You are required on the receipt of this order to cause elections to be held to fill all vacancies existing in the 3" Regiment and to have the Regiment organized and ready for service at a moments warning. Very respectfully Y” ob" servant G. K. WALKER Acting Gov" and Comd in chief of the Florida Militia TALLAHASSEE Dec 19* 1835 TO BRET. D. L. CLINCH U S Army SIR Your dispatches of the 3" and 5 Instant "reached me on the 8" Two days previous however an express arrived from the County of Alachua bringing the information communicated by you, and the raising the force required for the protection of the Frontier had already been commenced. But as you express in your letter of the 5" an intention of attacking the hostile Indians as soon as you should be in sufficient force, I have directed a greater number of troops to be raised than was thought necessary for the more defence of the frontier. That you may not be delayed in taking the prompt and decided means, that circumstances demand until the arrival of U. S. Soldiers, The Florida troops I have placed under the command of Brigadier Gen" R. K. Call who is instructed to cooperate with your command, any effort heretofore made for the arrest of the murderers of the person engaged in carrying the U. S. Mail during the past Summer, having as I have been informed unsuccessful, and the present position of the Seminoles destroying all hope that they will be voluntarily surrendered or that any good can result from a further delay of the energetic measures which alone seem calculated to effect this object, and regarding it a sacred duty, that such an act of Barbarity and outrage should not be permitted to go unpunished while I have the means of arresting the perpetrators, I have charged Gen Call, with the duty of securing the offenders, and delivering them over to the Civil authorities. In doing which I must request your aid and assistance I am Sir most Respy: Your ob" servant - G. K. WALKER Acting Governor Tallahassee FLORIDA December 20" 1835 HONOURABLE LEWIS CASS Secretary at War SIR—Since my letter of the 8” Instant,” Nothing of particular interest has reached me in regard to the Seminole Indians, I am informed by an individual from the frontier that a scout of eighteen men engaged in Scouring the Country, about thirty miles from the Indian reserve, were attacked by a superior force and effected their retreat to port with the loss of one man Kiled and one wounded Believing that the frontier could only be successfully protected by carrying the War into the enemies Country, I directed Brigadier General R. K. Call to accept the services of such volunteers, as might tender them to the number of five hundred men, that a force adequate to this purpose might be in readiness if required by the US Officer, in command at Fort King, This number of Florida Volunteers under the command of General Richard K. Call, are by this time at their Station ready for duty. A large party of Indians are reported to have been seen between the Suwannee, and St. Marks Rivers, with a great number of Canoes in which they transport themselves along the coast, and up the creeks, rivers, inlets &amp;c making into the sea with great facility, Their proximity to the most denseley populated, and central portion of the Territory, and the ease, and secrecy with which they may approach into the midst of the settlements by ascending the rivers in their canoes, has induced me to adopt measures for their removal or expulsion from this section of Country. Although I have not heard of any act of hostility being committed by them, As this cannot be done alone by a land force as they would be able readily to defeat pursuit, by resorting to their boats and as the shallowness of the water on the coast will not permit a vessel of any size to be employed, I have made application to the commanding officer of the West India squadron and of the Navy yard at Pensacola for a detachments of boats to cruise along the coast and up the rivers &amp;c, to intercept their retreat”—I will in the meantime however cause them to be communicated with through an Interpreter and if found to be friendly will cause them to be accompanied by a force Sufficient for their protection to Tampa Bay for the purpose of being embarked The sum of three Thousand Dollars, has been advanced by the Receiver of Public Money's at this place for the furnishing and provissioning the Florida Volunteers I have the honor to be Sir your most obedient Servant G. K. WALKER, Acting Gov' of Florida: By the Acting Governor of Florida Whereas it has been represented to me by the Judge of the Superior Court of the Middle District of Florida, by the District attoney of said District, and by many respectable citizens, That one Charles C.

Cowdry made the statement under oath for which he was convicted without being fully aware of the legal import of the words used in his affidavit and under a misconception of Law— and not with a design to charge the offence which the words used technically imported. Now therefore by virtue of the power in me vested, and considering the case of said Charles C. Cowdry as proper for executive Clemency. I do hereby fully pardon him for the commission of said offence and remit, pardon, and release, him from all legal penalties, and punishments affix by law for said offence, whether the same relates to a pecuniary fine, personal disqualification, or any other punishment or penalty whatsoever, as fully, amply, and completely as if said conviction had not taken place Seal of the In testimony whereof I have hereunto Set my name Territory and caused the seal of said Territory, to be affixed done at the Capitol in the City of Tallahassee this the 21" day of December A.

The other by the troops from Middle Florida, under the command of Genl Call, in which the Indians were defeated and four of their number Killed. The conduct of the troops from Middle Florida, is spoken of in the highest terms of approbation. But the force in the field is represented as too small to Conquer the Country, and a requisition has been made by the commanding General for two hundred and fifty in addition to the present number, out of this number your Regiment is required to 488173-60-20 furnish fifty, for this purpose you will cause the 5" Reg' to parade in the Town of Quincy on Tuesday the 29" Instant, and cause to be detailed that number. Each man must be furnished with a horse and armed with a rifle, musket or shot Gun and in every respect fully accoutered for the campaign, Volunteers will be prefered to drafted men, and the commander in chief flatters himself that from the prompt manner in which former requisitions have been met by the 5* Reg" that an appeal for Volunteers to aid their bretheren already in the field, and opposed to a foe Superior to them in number versed in all the wily stratagems of savage warfare, and determined on resistance to the last extremity will not be made in vain, But that on the contrary the will embrace with alacrity the opportunity now presented of arraying themselves under their Countrys Banner, and of proving themselves worthy of fellowship in arms, with their brave Countrymen now in the field whose gallant conduct has already attracted the favorable notice of their commanding officer.

K. Call, on the frontier of the Seminole Indians with dispaches as late as the 22" Instant.” He arrived at Micanopy (now called Fort Defiance) on the 20" with the volunteers from Middle Florida, under his command and had been joined by the East Florida, volunteers, making his command about five hundred men The day before his arrival at Fort Defiance, the Guard of the Baggage Waggon of Col. Warren's of the East Florida volunteers, was attacked and defeated by a party of Indians and the Baggage. amunition &amp; stores captured, the loss sustained was two or three men killd and six wounded, the day succeeding this affair, General Call pursued the same line of march and recovered all the Baggage &amp;c. lost with the exception of four kegs of powder. He fell in with a small Body of Indians on the 20" Instant, within a mile of Fort Defiance four of whom were killed in a skirmish that ensued, General Call represents the effective force now in service as sufficient to subdue any enemy that may be embodied But insufficient for the conquest of the County. as Indians disperse themselves in small bodies, of from ten to fifty in number, and therefore require a larger number of Troops to act against them in detachments, than if met in larger Bodies. He has made a requisition on the Territory for two hundred and fifty mounted men, in addition to his present command. and I have issued orders for their immediate detailment. The Frontier is described as being in the most exposed condition and entirely laid waste by the enemy, and deserted by our people for thirty miles along the Indian Limits, from the Suwannee to the S" Johns, the enemy are determined on resistance to the last extremity. But I do not doubt that the energetic measures taken will in a few weeks cause their compliance with the treaty— I have the honor to be most respectfully your ob' Servant G. K.

K. WALKER To H. B. OvKRSTREET &amp; others committee TALLAHASSEE 24 Jan’ 1836 SIR Application has been made to me, to give an order that you construct a temporary Block House, for the safety of your command some where near the Forks of Fenahalloway River—that it will serve as a safe Rendezvous for the rangers under your command in Madison County Of the propriety of this measure I cannot Judge &amp; hence must refer it to your Judgment &amp; discretion under a full confidence, that you will have the precaution to construct one, by a detail from your command, if it shall be considered necessary for the purposes of security to the portion, &amp; of inspiring to the settlers greater confidence. Vigilance on your part will be necessary to prevent any assault by the enemy; and a knowledge that you are vigilant will at least give greater quiet and confidence to the inhabitants who are around you. I have therefore to request &amp; direct that you scour the Country with activity &amp; zeal, so that an enemy if disposed may not succeed in making an undiscovered march upon the settlement. An early report of precautionary measures taken by you &amp; your views generally of anything that may prove beneficial to the . . . will be desirable Respectfully JN° H.

Before the 10" June next and make report of the same to me Given under my hand at office the 9" January 1836. JNO: H.EATON Gov' of Florida TO P. W GAUTIER Jn &amp; R. H. Long Marianna TALLAHASSEE 9* Jan”—36” Dr SIR By the enclosed dispatch from Genl. Call,” you will perceive that the Volunteers have returned home; and the security of the frontier of this Territory &amp; Geo.—is now at the mercy of the Indians. A few regulars equal to garrison duty &amp; 150 Militia, are all the force by Genl. Calls report, which is now in the field. Militia are few &amp; widely scattered here &amp; as for arms there are none. I send tomorrow an express to Augusta as in my letter I advised you I should do, to procure arms, if successful an expedition may be gotten up again by the last of this month. Again let me repeat. that a large &amp; improving force, will be necessary, as being the most economical to put down these Indians. a force barely adequate, act, with little confidence in themselves &amp; are all the time going to &amp; coming back from the war. Such you will see was the case with Gen'Call's volunteers, their term had expired. &amp; they would come home, with an enemy just in view of them, the Country is full of morasses &amp; Swamps, and such a force should be ordered, that occassional detachments may be sent out in different directions to intercept &amp; cut up the enemy, and parties be left to guard deports that necessarily may be required to be found in the rear of the advance—Two or three Steam Boats to scour the coast &amp; transport Troops, &amp; to furnish supplies will also be necessary, * The original text of this treaty is in NA(SD, Indian treaties); it is printed, 7 STAT. 427-428. See Royce, Indian Land Cessions, plate cxxi, cession designation 185. &amp; will prove economical altho their cost will be 1500 or $2000 a month to the Government. I have written to the Gov" Georgia” to know if he can not take the responsibility, of sending a force into the field. prompt action &amp; a good force will quiet everything here in 40. or 60. days—Tardiness, &amp; want of decision, may make it last a year. Why not order all the Spanish vessels who fish on our coast, &amp; no doubt aid &amp; encourage the Indians under their fishing pretexts, to depart out of our waters, The Act of 1794, June 5** &amp; 1800 April 24** gives the President the power to do so. It is very important I assure you, If you will authorize me I have a Steam Boat with Naval Officers on board to whom I will assign the duty. I think I have already the authority myself, but do not desire to act without the approval of the President Yours J. H. EATON LEWIS CASS Sec: of War. ExECUTIVE OFFICE 10th Jany 1836 GENL BROWN–Adjutant Genl: of Florida, You are directed to proceed to Augusta Georgia &amp; use your best exertions to obtain 500. muskets, &amp; 200 rifles from the ordinance officer in command of the arsenal, &amp; 100 Swords &amp; pistols, also cartriges Boxes &amp; belts—You will urge upon the officer, the necessity of speedy action.

<docbody>HON JO” M WHITE Tallahassee Florida SIR, I have received your letter of the 12" instant," dated at Augusta, and in answer, beg leave to inform you that, General Scott has been directed to place the regular troops in such positions as will best afford protection to the settlements in Florida. He has also been instructed not to remove any of these troops from the Territory. He has full power to call for such Militia force both mounted and Infantry, as may be necessary to subdue the Indians and to restrain them from committing depredations. Besides this, Governor Call has been informed that if, at any time the frontier is not properly defended, the Department will sanction the employment of any force he may find it necessary to call out for that purpose, before General Scott can take the proper measures. The Volunteer bill, has not yet passed. The moment it becomes a law," Governor Call will be authorized to raise One thousand men under it, such portion to be mounted as he may think proper, and to employ as many of them as may be necessary for the subjugation of the Seminoles. No law has been passed for increasing the Dragoons and consequently, I cannot adopt your suggestions on that subject. As to the Appropriation, every thing shall be asked for, by this Department, which shall seem necessary to restrain the Indians and protect the inhabitants. From the commencement of these difficulties, I know of no measure which seems to be proper, which has not been adopted, for suppressing these Indians. And you may rely upon it, that the measures for future defence, shall be upon a scale proportioned to the exigency. Positive instructions have been given for the liquidation and payment of all claims, against the United States, which it is in the power of the Department to pay.” L. C. </docbody>

<docbody>HON. P. F. BUTLER DEAR SIR In the year 1829 we became the purchasers from the Government of a body of Land situated on both sides of the St. Marks river in Township No. three of Range No. two South and east, in this Territory, and on a part of this Land, the west side of the River, We in August of the same year laid off into Lotts the present Town of Magnolia, and since that time have sold and given Warentee deeds to a great number of Lotts, on which the purchasers have made valuable improvements, dwelling-houses—Stores—Taverns and Ware houses &amp;c, and we have also built valueable extensive buildings, for the same purposes, to rent and for own occupation—that part of the Land including all the Town—laying on the west side of the river— has since been, by a decree of the Supreme Court of the U. States— at their January Term 1835–Granted to Colin Mitchel and others— they now claim of us this Land and ask the possession of it—We as humble citisens who are about to have their property taken from them without recompense, by the operation of our countrys Laws—Ask your advice in what manner we shall proceed–Shall we give them the possession without a suit? or shall we be obliged to contest it at Law—the very operation of this Law thus far—has brought us from a state of affluence, as we was when we first emigrated to this Territory, in the year 1825—to a now state of insolvency—which renders us totally unable to pay the necessary costs to carry this point through the proper courts of our country—Such is our anxiety to know our situation, we shall be impatient for your answer—We did not know of this claim including this Land at the time of our purchase, nor could it have been known to the Surveyor General or he would not of course have had it surveyed—We have until this singular or unexpected decree of the Court was known considered ourselves Safe under the eleventh section of the missourie Law—but now it is said the Court have pronounced, by their decree in the case, that section of the Law unconstitutional. We presume it unnecessary to refer you to the Statue Laws of the U.S.—which werpresume doubtless you are familiar with—on which we have concluded ourselves safe underever since we have learned that this place was included within their Lines—We have no other acquaintance in the City of Washington to refer you to but Col. Jos. M. White, to him as a particular friend, we would refer you for all the information on this subject and of ourselves, you may desire—Permit us my dear Sir, to add that we are extremely solicitious to know your opinion, and have your advice how to proceed—that we may not in any manner compromise our claim of the General Government for a just and full recompense, if this property shall be taken from us—If we are intrusive in this application to you for advice, you will pardon our presumption and attribute it to our ignorance—We have conceived this a transaction in which the Government might be involved, and under this impression, have thought ourselves entitled to your advice in the Case * We are, dear Sir your most Obedient Humble Servants JOHN &amp; NATHANIEL HAMLEN [Addressed] Hon.

<docbody>To the Editor of the Pensacola Gazette: I have observed in some just and judicious remarks in your paper of the 9th ult. in relation to the increasing prospects and population of Black Water, that in parenthesis you give a word for the “ear of Col. White.” This is done in so good humoured a manner, and is so fair a hit, that I cannot enter into a grave defence to shew that numbers of voters are not necessary to urge me to attend to the interests of the good people of Black Water. The spur or motion of the whip is necessary even to spirited chargers, whose energies and mettle are flagging under hard service, (or to borrow a phrase from the military) public men, like soldiers, must keep an eye on the fugleman, whose evolutions on the first Monday of May, may unhorse the inattentive and negligent. But to the point, as the lawyers say, I have had inserted in the Bill for new Post Routes, one from Pensacola by Florida, Black Water, Pittman’s Ferry, to Marianna," and thence, as now established, to Tallahassee, and have had a further appropriation reported for completing that road. The Post Route Bill is only passed for all the States and Territories at one time, and generally once in two or three years. This interval causes inconvenience sometimes to settlers, where, new places grow up so rapidly as Black Water. This was done before I heard that there was a voting population of one hundred and fifty, (which I am glad to hear,) as heretofore Black Water has furnished White men.

It is ascertained without doubt, that a large body of Indians are collecting in the neighbourhood of Cape Sable, but twenty miles from Indian Key. Their fires are Seen from that Island. Parties of straggling Indians are frequently Seen between the Chain of Islands on this Coast and the Main Land.” The Light House at Cape Florida is So much exposed that the light keeper is about to abandon it. Two Indians and a Spaniard have been taken prisoners at Indian Key. The undersigned would not presume to judge of the exigencies of the Naval Service, but would respectfully Suggest the propriety of a permanent establishment of a Cutter on this Coast, if the Same can be done consistently with the interests of other Naval operations."

<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY R. K. CALL Governor of Florida Tallahassee. SIR, I addressed you a short letter on saturday,” informing you that General Clinch's resignation had been accepted,” and renewing the authority for you to take command of the regular troops and militia serving in Florida. It is the expectation of the President, that you will employ them in the best manner in the subjugation of the Indians, and the protection of the country. The proper operations must be committed to your own discretion. The President is disposed to think well of the plan suggested by you, but there are also many circumstances, which must have weight in such a matter, that the proper measures can only be determined upon where they are to be carried into effect. Among these, not the least important, is the climate. It is obvious that a very great risk of human life from its insalubrity, ought not to be, unless the state of the Country absolutely requires such an exposure. Opinions upon the subject of carring on a campaign during the summer have been variant. You must exercise a sound discretion upon the whole matter. I enclose a copy of a letter this day addressed to General Scott,” by which you will see that orders have been given to him to send to your aid, one thousand of the West Tennessee mounted men, should you not succeed in raising the volunteer force authorized by my letter of May 25th." You will immediately communicate to General Scott your views upon the matter &amp; likewise upon the subject of your operations generally, as his movements and yours, may affect each other. I enclose also, an extract of the instructions of January 21st given to General Scott on the subject of the final disposition of the Seminole Indians." Should you succeed in reducing them to submission, you will carry into effect the measures directed in that letter. The Tennessee troops will be armed," and I presume that you have ere this, procured a sufficient quantity of arms for the use of such of your militia, as from time to time, may be called into service. Colonel Bomford” will correspond with you on the subject of arms and ammunition. General Towson” has directed a Paymaster to proceed immediately to Tallahassee, who I presume will have reached there before you receive this letter. He will pay all the militia &amp; volunteers who have been or may be in the service of the United States. General Towson will communicate with you upon this subject. I understand that Captain Shannon is at Tallahassee, with full authority to make all payments on account of the Quarter Masters Department. The Acting Quarter Master General will inform you of his arrangements. The Commissary General of Subsistence will also communicate with you on the subject of provisions, and all requisitions which you may find it necessary to make upon the Officers of the various departments, in order to carry on your operations, will be promptly complied with. All the necessary means will be placed at their disposal. The Surgeon General "will in like manner, communicate with you. You were some time since informed that arrangements were made for the employment of five steam boats, and for having a part of these manned by seamen from the Navy. You will perceive, that in my instructions to General Scott, I have requested him to allow one or more of these boats to ply in such places as you may direct. I would recommend that you correspond with him upon this point, and also with the proper naval Officer. Should you however, not receive the aid of these boats, and should require them, you will procure them elsewhere if praticable, and should you find boats of other descriptions necessary, you are at liberty to have them purchased or constructed, and indeed to procure whatever else may be necessary, to your operations and in accordance with the usages of the service."

Were I disposed to regard Etiquette more than duty I should not again trouble you, but this I am not permitted to do under my instructions from the War Department, even if it were my disposition. I have therefore to request that a competent Officer and crew may be ordered from the Squadron under your command to make a survey of the Coast between the Bay of Tampa and the Mouth of the Withlocoochee river. This survey will be highly important in the contemplated expedition against the Indians many of whom it is believed are living on the Rivers and inlets on that part of the Coast of which we have so little knowledge. The object of the survey is to ascertain the practicability of ascending those rivers and inlets with boats to carry supplies to the enemy operating in that quarter. The Wessel employed in that service should be of light draught and well furnished with Boats, capable of being fortified. If such an one can be chartered the Quarter Master will be instructed to pay for it.” I am Sir Very Respectfully Y. Obt Serv" (Sign") R. K. CALL COMMO. A. J.

<docbody>SIR, I cannot any longer forbear from troubling you with my complaints, against the negligence of the official conduct of Samuel Blair Esq., the Marshal of the United States, for this district, in Florida; and also that of his deputy, who pretends to act for the Marshal, during his absence. M Blair himself resides about forty miles from this City, on the S" Johns river, and rarely comes to his office here, more than once in two or three months, and then remains here only a day or two. Consequently his personal attendance to the duties of his office, is of very little public use. His deputy is extremely negligent and inattentive to the duties of the Office. The room in the City Hall here, where our Courts are held, and other public offices are kept, and which is in the center of this town, and which room is very pleasant and convenient; but it is the last place in the City where the Marshal or his deputy is to be found, at any hour of the day. The deputy himself has lately been absent from this City, for eight or ten days, and some other person, not known, has acted, as the deputy of the deputy, the Marshal himself not being here at all. It appears to me that such negligence of Official duty is not known, in any other district of Florida, or City in the United States. I have been driven to make these complaints, by the Shameful misconduct of this deputy marshal, yesterday and to day. Yesterday I had issued by the Clerk of the Superior Court, in a very important and pressing law proceeding—a writ of Replevin, called a precept, and it was delivered to the deputy Marshal yesterday, with a request to serve it immediately. He had ample time to do so yesterday, but seeing him accidentally in the Street this morning, he told me that he had not yet served it. I again requested him to execute the business without delay, but it is now in the evening, and nothing in the matter has been done, and I can find him no where. In New York I well know, that the Marshal of the United States, and the Sheriff in the City, are very prompt in doing their official duty; but I am sorry to say, that dilatory and negligent conduct is a prevailing vice in Florida. I have not the least animosity to Mr Blair or to his deputy. M" Blair himself is a very courteous and gentlemanly man, and when the Court is sitting here, he regularly attends to his official duties, but when no court is held, he is not to be found in his office, whether even when he be is in town er het, except very rarely. I practice law in this Territory, especially in this City and in Jacksonville, consequently have frequent occasion for the official services of the Marshal of the United States or his deputy, who performs the duty of a Sheriff in the States of our Union. With great respect, I have the honor to be Sir, Your ob" Serv" JOHN RODMAN Collector of St Augustine THE HON” JOHN FORSYTH Secretary of State Washington [Addressed] The Hon" John Forsyth Secretary of State Washington [Postmarked] S*Augustine Fl.

<place-time><location>Collector's Office KEY WEST</location><month>August</month><date>1</date><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>STEPHEN PLEASONTON Esq. Fifth Auditor &amp;c SIR—It becomes my painful duty to announce to you, that on the 23" Ultimo a party of about forty Indians made an Attack on the Light house at Cape Florida, and burned all the buildings at that place. The two men there in charge, Thompson &amp; Carter, were hired by Mr. Dubose, to remain there constantly, while he occasionally comes to Key West to Visit his family. Dubose had left the Light house to Visit Key West five days before the attack of the Indians. So sudden &amp; unexpected was the attack, that these men had hardly time to get into the Light House. The Indians after exchanging a few shots, made a fire against the light-house door, from which it soon communicated to the oil &amp; other combustible materials kept on the ground floor &amp; to the Stairs—The two men retreated into the lantern carrying with them a Keg of powder, with which the Keeper had been furnished for the purpose of defence. The wooden suttle soon gave way before the flames, and the heat compelled these men to go on the out-side the lantern &amp; lay down on the platform. In this situation they were exposed in some degree to the rifles of the Indians, and to an intence heat, which melted the glass from the lantern. There Thompson received three rifle balls through one of his feet, was wounded in the ancle of his other ehe leg, and Carter was Killed by a rifle ball. In this horrible situation, Thompson finding the heat insupportable at length threw down the Keg of powder through the scuttle—probably with the design of distroying himself &amp; building together— But it is supposed, that it exploded near the door, as its principal effect was to throw down the burning Stair-case, and deaden the fire. The U.S. Transport, Scho Motto was within sight of the burning buildings, &amp; the crew heard the explosion, but on account of light &amp; adverse could not approach nearer than seven miles of the scene that night. The next morning, the wind being still unfavorable, two boats were manned from the Motto &amp; proceed to the Cape. On their way, they recovered a Sloop boat, which the Indians had taken &amp; in which they had deposited their plunder It was found impossible to rescue Thompson from his elevated situation that day, as every effort made to shoot up a line proved abortive—The day after however it was accomplished. The day fellewing, after he had been suffering there more than thirty six hours. The other man, Carter, was burried &amp; the place abandoned. Thompson was brought to this place &amp; is in a fair way to do well—indeed his recovery is deemed certain, but it is feared he will be a cripple for life. He being a seaman by profession, and only volunteering for a short time in this exposed situation, I have thought it but equitable to extend the usual aid to sick and disabled seamen. This is the only aid I felt authorised to extend, without the sanction of the Department.— The gale of august last, had injured the foundations of these buildings, &amp; it was doubtful if the Keepers house could have been repaired—The light house was badly cracked, even before the explosion of gun powder. It is believe the whole will require re-building so soon as the Indian hostility ceases—If so, I would suggest, that that their location be changed to Soldier's Key about five miles southerly, and about the same distance nearer the Reef-There it will afford a safer land mark, both to Wessels passing the Gulf &amp; to those passing inside the Reef. It is also believed there will be greater comfort &amp; exemption from mosquitoes"— Very respectfully Sir I am Yr Obt Servt W. A. WHITEHEAD Collr by A. GORDON Dy Coll [Endorsed] Key West.

<docbody>To HON” LEWIS CASS Secretary of War. SIR, I have the honor to submit, for your consideration the enclosed copies of two letters from Archibald Smith jr. Esq Agent residing among the Appalachicola Indians.” It will be Seen, that the Indians mentioned by the Agent are a part of those to whom the Government guaranteed the peaceable possession of certain reservations of land by the Treaty of Camp Moultrie, dated 18 Sep 1823. The Agent represents them to be now, and to have ever been, peaceable and friendly towards the whites, and that, indeed, when called upon by the Governor of Florida, they Sent their warriors to battle for the United States. It further appears, that the operations of the War have reduced these Indians to a condition peculiarly unfortunate and oppressed. They have been Subjected to the hostilities of the Seminoles, and the treachery and plunder of the whites. They have been robbed of their Slaves and other property, and driven from their homes; and having been prevented from raising their usual crops, they are greatly Suffering for Subsistence. They have applied to this Office for Some corn and beef. Not conceiving it to be the province of this Office to furnish the Supply asked for, I refer the matter to the Secretary of War in the hope that he will consider that the necessities of these people may be relieved under the “Resolution authorizing the President to furnish rations to certain inhabitants of Florida,” passed February 1" 1836;” or at least under the law of usage which has authorized, at all times, the issuing of provisions to Suffering Indians.” G.G. e- </docbody>

<docbody>SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 8” Ins" requesting explanations of certain charges against me and one of my Deputies, made by John Rodman Esq." Collector of the Port of S" Augustine—His letter containing those charges dated 23" of July 1836* I have the honor also to acknowledge the receipt of from your Department (by copy)— How far M Rodman is free from the “least animosity” and how far his charges are true will appear by recital of facts—I will first beg leave to state that the present condition of the Country is such as to require unusual vigilance in relation to its slave population, especially in St Augustine, in the neighbourhood of which place the Indians have constantly been lurking—Notwithstanding this watchfulness some Negroes did escape and it is generally believed held communication with the Indians; they subsequently returned, and were found secreted in the house of M. Rodmans Negro Woman Rebecca, she with the others was arrested and taken before the Mayor —M Rodman being informed of this, caused a Writ of replevin to be issued for the recovery of the woman, a certified copy of which I herewith enclose Marked N° 1"—By reference to this writ it will be seen that it was dated on the 22" day of July, and by the Deputys endorsed return, it was returned to the Clerks office by him on the 23” alth" not made returnable until the October Term as will appear by the back of the writ itself—I regret that the then acting Clerk has left the Territory, for he could and would bear testimony that the Writ was returned in the morning of the 23"—Yet M Rodman states in his letter of that date to the Secretary of State “It is now in the evening and nothing in the matter has been done—On the 25 of July M Rodman writes to M' Fontane (a copy of his letter of that date I herewith enclose Marked N° 2)" accusing him of not having executed the writ, but also of not having made any return of it— If M Rodman did not go to the Clerks Office from the 23" to the 25" to ascertain whether the writ was returned or not, he was surely negligent of his own interest, and not knowing whither the accusation against M. Fontane was true or not (and he could not know without going to the Clerks Office) it was certainly unjustifiable on his part to make it—If he did go between the 23" and 25" and ascertained that the writ was returned (which he must have ascertained if he went there) then the accusation against the Deputy contained in his letter of the 25" must I think be attributed to Motives not altogether correct—In this letter he remarks “on a complaint made against him (M" Blair) about a year ago for his negligence, he was severely repremanded by the Government” If such a repremand is on file in the State Department I am entirely ignorant of its contents as I have never received from the State or other Department any communication of that character. It is true that I reside nearly forty miles to the Westward of S" Augustine, and it is also true that my District extends from East to West about one hundred and fifty miles, S*Augustine being on the extreme East; and from North to South about two hundred—there are three other places besides S*Augustine at which Terms of the Superior Court are held, at each of those places I must of necessity have a deputy, whe are het upon whose integrity I can rely, but who sometimes commit errors because they are not familiar with business, and are at a loss sometimes how to proceed; I have hence found it necessary to fix my residence as near the center of business in the District as possible in order particularly that I may superintend the business of these Western Counties as far as possible—I do this with the greater safety as I have two Deputies in S*Augustine, one of whom particularly (I speak of M" Fontane) is so familiar with all the duties of the Office, &amp; so prompt and active in the discharge of those duties that I have never been disappointed in his manner of transacting business connected with the Office." Mr Rodman states in his letter to the Secretary that “he (M* Blair) rarely comes to his Office here (S' Augustine) more than once in two or three months”—I refer you to the enclosed communications Marked N* 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 * in reference to this charge; I cannot forbear expressing my astonishment that M Rodman should have made this charge, as I have never I believe at any one period been out of St Augustine for a greater length of time than from ten to fifteen days, a fact of which M Rodman must have been conscious at the time he made the statement, as I believe we have frequently met whenever I have been in S* Augustine—I was in the act of leaving St Augustine when your letter was received, &amp; while the Clerk was copying the Writ enclosed, the communications N* 3, 4, 5 and 6 were handed to me. I could have procured the testimony of every man in the City to the same point but thought it unnecessary, particularly as I had business which required my presence at this place Mr Rodman charges that even during my absence M. Fontane has himself been absent—this I know to be true, but Mr Rodman is perfectly aware that there is another Deputy there always ready to attend to the business of the Office, I say he must be aware of this fact, as I think this Deputy (M Avice) must have transacted business for and with M Rodman as he has been constantly discharging the duties of Deputy Marshal for nearly five years past. But not satisfied with trying to produce the empression that the City is left sometimes without the Marshal or a Deputy, M Rodman continues by stating, that “some other person not known has acted as the Deputy of the Deputy”—if M Rodman had not known this statement to be untrue at the time he made it, he would not have rested a day or night until he found out “the person not known,” and all the particulars connected with the case in which it occurred—the statement so far as I can examine is I do not hesitate to say utterly untrue I believe I have noticed all the charges made by M Rodman and I hope to the satisfaction of your Department, if however I am mistaken in this, if in the brief space of time I could remain in S*Augustine after the receipt of your communication, I have not furnished sufficient proof for that purpose as to any charge—I do desire that some proper person in S*Augustine may be designated before whom the matter may be investigated. I am very respectfully Sir Your Obd" Serv" SAMUEL BLAIR Marshal Dis' E. Florida HONB'ASBURY DICKINS Acting Secretary of State P.S..

<docbody>SIR/I am advised by the War Department that you have been ordered by the proper authority to co-operate with me in conducting the war against the Seminole Indians. The Brigade of Tennessee Volunteers, and the Troops from Middle and West Florida will march from this place on the 19* and the campaign will open on the 25* Inst in the Northern part of the enemy's country. It is expected that another division of the Army will be in operation in that part of the Nation embracing the Bay of Tampa and Charlottes Harbour, in a few weeks; As far as the Army can march to the South, the country will be traversed and it is hoped the enemy will be routed or destroyed. But there is a district commencing a short distance South of Cape Carmanal on the eastern, and the Charlotte Harbour on the Western margin of the Peninsula which can only be penetrated in boats;—The Water on the ever glades so far as I have been able to collect information varies from two to Six feet in depth. Within this region it is represented there are many Islands to which the Indians resort in canoes, and on some of which they have permanent settlements. It is reported to me that there are two or three hundred of them assembled on New river, and on the Keys along the Coast, * Letters of Joseph S. Sanchez and David Levy, both dated Aug. 24, 1836; present but not here reproduced. the number may be exagerated, but the burning of the Light House at Cape Florida, and other recent discoveries render it certain that the enemy is to be found in that quarter in some force. I would respectfully suggest that the most effective co-operation you can give to the Land forces in the prosecution of the war will be by sending an expedition in boats to act in that part of the Peninsula. The very limited information I possess on the subject does not enable me to suggest the kind of Boats which may be required for this service, it is most probable however that those of the lightest draught would be best adapted, though many of the Bayons and inlets are said to be deep enough to receive boats of the largest size. I have no information which will enable me to suggest the number of men, and boats which should be employed in this service. On this subject as well as the time when the expedition might proceed with safety, your own intelligence and that of the Naval Officers will best determine. The region to be explored being almost entirely unknown, many unforeseen obstacles may be anticipated in the progress of the expedition. At Key West and Indian Key the best guides can be obtained to lead to the present location of the Indians. I am Sir Very Respectfully Your Obt Sevt (Sign") R. K. CALL Governor of Florida COMMODORE A.

That before directing Suit to be instituted which of course should be done by the appointment of a Special Attorney, to act for the United States, I had thought proper to apprize you of the papers being in my hands, with the hopes that you might have it in your power to make arrangements for the settlement of the claim in a reasonable time, and thereby save me the necessity of directing a Suit.— In your reply dated March 8, 1836,” you informed me that you would forthwith transmit to this office duplicates of accounts and vouchers heretofore transmited to the proper Department, Shewing the disbursements of the moneys charged to you, &amp;c.— Those papers not coming to hand agreeably to your promise, I again on the 25, of May last addressed you on the Subject,” with a request that you would let me hear from you by the return mail. To this letter no answer has yet been received.—Permit me once more to call your attention to this subject, and to request an early anSWer.- I am &amp;c N. H. To JAMES D. WESTCOTT J Esq. U.

<place-time><location>Confidential FORT DRANE</location><date>22</date><month>Oct</month><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>MY DEAR GENL I wrote you a haisty note on the 19* Ins' * Since when nothing of importance has occurred, except the death of Co' Lane" commander of the Creek Volunteers, who in a paroxism of delirium, committed suicide in a few hours after he arrived in my camp. In this valuable officer the Service has Sustained a Severe loss, but I am happy to Say that the Indians have become reconciled, and evince every disposition to prosecute the war with vigour. I have Sent all the mounted men to forage at Black Creek. In a few days I shall have the fort and store houses at this place reestablished, and a good stock of provisions brought in. So soon as the officer returns whom I sent to the mouth of the Withlacoochie (viz) S" Marks, I Shall march with the force at this place consisting of the Creek Warriors, and a few Regular Troops, and open a communication with our Supplies in that quarter, which will be in the heart of their country, and within thirty miles of the Strong hold of the enemy. Allow me General to call your particular attention to the Officers of the Army now under my command. Among the Captains and Subalterns there are some officers of distinguished merit, but the field officers generally so far as their conduct has come under my observation with the exception of Maj Pierce" are totally inefficient. I do nothing more than common justice to Maj Pierce when I say that he is one of the most energetic, efficient and valuable Officers I have ever known. Indeed Sir I cannot say more of him than he deserves, and but for his extraordinary exertions after the abandonment of Micanopy by order of Col Crane * the frontier would have been desolated, and this army would have suffered greatly for the want of supplies, for I had depended on Micanopy as a temporary depot, and had ordered Col Crane to throw a large quantity of supplies in to that post, and did not hear of its abandonement until a few days before the arrival of the Tennessee Troops. This gave the enemy undisputed possession of the country, and I could not introduce supplies until I march the army in to protect them. The Gallant attack made by Maj Pierce on the enemy at this place on the 48 21" of August, with a force so greatly inferior, and the entire Success with which it was attended, entitles him in my opinion, to the brevet Rank of Liut Col Col, and the extraordinary exertions made by him since that time, in defending the frontier, in acting in the field with me, and inforwarding Supplies to the army entitles him to a further advancement and the brevet rank of Colonel. By bestowing this rank upon him, you will not only reward distinguished merit, but you will give efficiency to the Army by placing him in a Situation to command all the liut Colnels some of whom at least are perfect drones, and would be of no Service in the field. I have also to request that Liuts Irwine,” and Hubert” who were with Maj Pierce in the action of the +8.21" of August, and who were distinguished for their gallantry on that occasion may both be breveted. There is one subject General on which I feel it my duty to lodge a complaint with you. It is against the manner in which the officers of the army under my command are ordered away and are furloughed without my knowledge or consent. Lieut Col Foster * of the 4' Inf, who managed to get off to Batton Rouge immediately after Genl Scott left the field, when ordered back to Florida on my application, returned to his post where he did not remain more than three or four weeks, when he rec" a furlough from the War department, and is still absent. Within a few days past Liut Pickell * has been ordered to joine Col Fenwick * at Baltimore as his Adj. and Liut Irwine, has been ordered to joine Genl Eustice" at Charleston in the same capacity. These Officers both left the Territory before I was apprised of the order, but for this I should not have permited it, as we have now less than one officer for every two companies. The want of Officers I assure you Sir is severely experienced, and I have to request that Liut Col Foster of the 4* Inf" liuts Irvings, Pickell, and all other officers belonging to the Army of Florida may be ordered immediately to joine their respective corps I fear Genl many of the officers are anxious to avoid this service, and some of the highest grade are disposed to embarrass the campaign.” Yours affectionately R. K. CALL </docbody>

<place-time><location>Respectfully Submitted. [</location><month>October</month><date>25</date><year>1836</year></place-time>
<docbody>TO GEN CHARLES GRATIOT Chief Engineer Report of the Progress made in the Improvement of the Inland Navigation between the S" Mary's and St John's Rivers to the 30" September 1836; as follows. The year ending 30 September 1835, the undersigned was instructed in March to examine this route in person, and prepare a Project of Operations for the approval of the Dep** An examination in person took place in June and a Partial Project was accordingly submitted " and approved by the Dep" and arrangements entered into for the construction of a Dredge Boat &amp; Mud flats &amp; the necessary machinery &amp;c. &amp;c, which it was expected would be got into operation in January following. During the year ending 30° September 1836, a Dredge Boat, two Mud flats &amp; one wood flat were completed. On the 7" Dec as soon as two of the flats were finished, they were sent to Amelia Dividings, under the control of an overseer with instructions to take hands that had been engaged at S*Mary's and proceed to removing the oyster beds as far as practicable, till the Dredge Boat be got ready. On the 15" December the overseer &amp; hands were at work at low water removing the obstructions at Amelia Dividings. 30" December Lt James S. Williams entered on his duties as assistant. On the 3" January Lt Williams was despatched with the Steamer Essayons and one flat in tow for Amelia Dividings: with a view to afford the aid of an additional flat to the overseer &amp; to inspect, and make a reconnaissance, preparatory to a Survey of the dividings west of Talbot Island. The flats and hands were removed in January to the Sisters to break up the oyster beds preparatory to dredging. The 12* January Lt Williams received instructions to make a Survey of Talbot Dividings, in order to ascertain precisely what mode be best to overcome the difficulties of many short turns in a narrow and shallow channel. He had commenced this Survey but had made but little progress when he received orders direct from the adjutant Genl. to join the undersigned from Engineer Duty. His labour as well as the expense of making preparations for the Survey were lost as not enough had been done to render his notes worth preserving." The 3d March the overseer &amp; his hands were Ordered back to Cockspur Island to take charge of the Dredge Boat as soon as it be finished. It was not however till the 23" June, that the Dredge was completed &amp; left the Savannah River in tow of the Steamer Florida with the undersigned: and was established at work on the 28* of the same month at Amelia Dividings. From that date it has removed 1,300. cubic yards of mud &amp;c from the bottom of the channel way, and according to the report of the Captain has improved materially this passage. The operation of dredging is necessarily slow in this passage as the Boat can only work when afloat and in this way can load but the two flats about at high water. The expediency of increasing the number of flats will soon be the subject of serious consideration. In consequence of having been refused the assistant from the Department that was applied for, the undersigned has not been able to make a complete project for this Improvement. Yet in addition to the Partial Project already submitted, he has been enabled to obtain a hasty survey of the dividings west of Talbot Island (see A hereunto annexed): and proposes that the cut from C to D therein recommended, be decided on by the Department for the present, as the undersigned agrees with the Gentleman Mr Wim O. Williams who made this survey, and doubts, on a hasty view of the matter, the expediency of the long cut from D to E.

<docbody>that with these supplies, you intended marching to the Wythlacoochie, in the hope of encountering the enemy in his strong holds; and that the depots at Volusia and at the mouth of the Wythlacoochie, would afford the means of replenishing your supplies, it was confidently hoped that this rumor would prove erroneous. It was, however, substantially confirmed by various communications received during the early part of the present week, which also gave us the additional intelligence, that Colonel Lane with the regulars and friendly Indians under his command, after marching from Tampa Bay to the Wythlacoochie, had also retired to Fort Drane: that the Tennessee Brigade, having sustained a serious loss in horses, and being destitute of forage, had been moved to Black Creek; and that in consequence of these untoward events and for the want of horses, transportation, and supplies, your operations are likely to be suspended for several weeks. The mails since, though they have not brought us any communication from yourself, have finished ample details as to all these events, which have been still further elucidated by the verbal statements of Lieutenant Mitchell, lately of your Staff, who it appears had been despatched to this place and to Philadelphia, on business connected with the replenishing of your supplies. That Officer also reports, * Not present. that at the time of his departure, you were suffering severely from sickness and fatigue. In the mean time, the preparation of such orders from this Department, as the exigency of the case requires, has been deferred, in the hope of receiving your Official report; but the mail of the last night having failed to bring it, it is deemed indispensable to the public interests, to take, without further delay, such measures as appear to be required by the facts within the knowledge of the Department. Although no definitive judgment has been formed as to the occurrences above referred to, I am yet instructed by the President, to express to you his disappointment and surprize, that you should have commenced the execution of a campaign of so much importance, and so long meditated, without first taking effectual measures to secure all needful supplies, from the various depots which for several months have been subject to your orders; and above all, that after approaching with so large a force within so short a distance of the enemy, and finding him apparently disposed to give battle, you should have retired without a more serious attempt to cross the river and to drive him from his position. This disappointment and regret are greatly increased by the consideration that these retrograde movements will probably have the effect to expose the frontiers to new invasions by marauding parties, and to encourage the Indians in their resistance, thereby increasing beyond what might otherwise have been needed, the severity of the measures which will now be required to subdue them. It is due to these considerations and also to the Army and to yourself, that the circumstances connected with your late movements, should be distinctly explained: and in case you shall not have transmitted a full report on the subject, before the receipt of this communication, you will do so without delay. In the mean time it is hoped, that the Army will soon be prepared to resume offensive operations. But as there is reason to fear that the state of your health will not allow you to finish the campaign, with the promptitude and energy which the cricis demands, the President deems it expedient to relieve you from the command. By his direction, I have therefore this day instructed Major General Jesup, if he shall not already have united with you, to do so at once, or to communicate with you on the subject without delay, and thereupon to assume the command of the Army serving in Florida, which you will accordingly be pleased to transfer to him. A copy of the despatch to him is herewith transmitted to you, and the original is borne by the same messenger, who will deliver you this communication. Should General Jesup not be at your headquarters, on the arrival of the messenger, you will take the earliest measures to despatch him to the place where you shall have the best reasons to suppose that Officer will be found, with the utmost expedition; and in the mean time, you will make all such dispositions as may be in your power for promoting the plan of the campaign prescribed in the instructions to General Jesup. And after he shall have relieved you, you will also be pleased to cooperate, so far as the state of your health and your other engagements may allow, in the execution of his duties.” </docbody>

<docbody>MAJOR GEN THOMAS S. JESUP U States Army. Florida. SIR, Before this communication reaches you, you will have become fully acquainted with the retrograde movements of Governor Call, and the other events connected therewith, which have recently occurred in Florida. These circumstances have for a time suspended offensive operations; and from the feeble state of Governor Call's health, it is to be feared that he will not be able to prosecute the campaign, when resumed, with that promptitude and energy which the crisis demands. The President has therefore determined to commit to you the command of the army serving in Florida, and the general direction of the war against the Seminoles. You will accordingly, on the receipt of this communication should you then be at Governor Call's headquarters, and if not, so soon as you can reach there, or can communicate with him, assume the command of all the forces in the Territory.” The hostile Indians having been discovered in considerable force on the banks of the Wythlacoochie, and it having been also ascertained that their principal Camps and settlements are situated on the south side of that river, you will immediately make all suitable arrangements for a vigorous attack upon their strongholds, and for penetrating and occupying the whole country between the Wythla- coochie and Tampa Bay. With a view to this end, you will first establish posts at or near the mouth of the Wythlacoochie, at Fort King, and at Volusia; and you will take the proper measures for securing through them, the safety of the frontier. You will also through the same posts, and by such means of transportation as may be most certain and economical, make permanent arrangements for procuring sufficient and regular supplies. So soon as those dispositions shall be completed, you will concentrate all your disposable forces, and proceed without delay to cross the Wythlacoochie, and to possess yourself of the positions now occupied by the Indians; attacking and routing them in their strongholds, and scouring the whole country between the Wythlacoochie and Tampa Bay. Should you succeed in bringing the Indians to a general engagement, and in defeating them therein, the ready submission of the tribe may probably be expected. If however, they should abandon their present position on the Wythlacoochie, before you reach it, or you should drive them from it, without entirely subduing them, you will then take such advanced positions to the South of Volusia and to the East and South of Tampa Bay, as the nature of the country may admit, and push from them such further operations, as may be necessary to the most speedy and effectual subjugation of the enemy. The above direction to attack the enemy in his strongholds and to possess yourself of the country between the Wythlacoochie and Tampa Bay, you will regard as a positive order, to be executed at the earliest practicable moment. In other respects, you will exercise a sound discretion, and will adopt such measures as you may deem best calculated to protect the frontiers and to effect the subjugation and removal of the Indians. Great confidence being reposed in your prudence, energy and skill, it is deemed unnecessary to urge you to promptitude or activity, or to impress on you the importance of early and frequent communications. B F BUTLER Secy of War ad interim P. S. Since preparing the foregoing despatch your letters to the Adjutant General of the 16th,” and 17th ultimo” announcing your arrival at Tampa Bay, and your intended departure on the 18th with three companies of Artillery, to the mouth of the Wythlacoochie in order to join the Indian warriors at that place have reached here. These despatches, though they excite some apprehensions as to the safety of your detachment, do not make it necessary to alter the above. I have also just received, and enclose for your perusal and consideration, a memorandum from the Acting Quarter Master General, prepared in reply to certain inquiries made by me, in respect to the best mode of transporting supplies &amp;c. in Florida." The President concurs, in general, in the views stated in this paper, and it may perhaps furnish some suggestions which may be of service to you hereafter. </docbody>

<docbody>LT. J. K. F. MANSFIELD Corps of Engrs Savannah Geo: SIR/I have examined M. Williams' project for improving the Talbott narrows in the inland passage between St: Marys &amp; St Johns and, with him, entertain doubts whether the longer cut suggested from E to D of the plan would insure the navigation the most permanent good.” The effect of the cut would give to the current a much increased velocity by diminishing the length of the channel between the two points, thereby causing a greater removal of sand or earth in its course which must again be deposited at some point a little beyond where the influence of this increased current is felt, and, consequently, there must be a failure in the intended object.—My own idea on the subject is that streams in their effort to find the lower level in alluvion do so by following the longest line that will admit of a gentle current, which will not abrase or disturb the banks of the canal they have formed for themselves—hence the sinuous course often observed—and it appears reasonable that, in the effort to deepen them, care should be taken as much as is practicable, to confine the improvement to the way indicated by nature, and if any change is to be made in this it should be merely in widening the water way at points where it is too narrow for the purposes of safe and easy navigation; as at the point F, of the plan, where the turn is so short as scarcely to give room for the passage of two boats at the same time. By adopting this suggestion a uniform plane of descent would be maintained and the liability of new bars forming in consequence of an accelerated current at occasional points much diminished. Believing the foregoing theory to be correct, I therefore recommend its application to the improvement in question.” I am &amp;c C. GRATIOT </docbody>

<docbody>SIR Your letter of the 4* Inst: * was delivered to me by Lieut: Johnston " a few miles from this place on my approach and I regret exceedingly that my ill health, and the many important official duties which have claimed my attention should have compelled me to delay my answer until the present time. I shall surrender most cheerfully to Gen' Jessup the command of the army in which the President has been pleased to supercede me, and have given Lieut: Johnston every facility in my power to find the camp of that officer. I must be permitted to say that I regarded your letter as the most extraordinary document I have ever read. It informed me of a rumour which had reached Washington very unfavourable to my conduct &amp; military character. It reminds me of the means, and supposed means I possessed of achieving a victory over the enemy. Of the unwillingness of of the department to credit the rumours, but that it had been substantially confirmed by various communications rec" &amp;c and further “elucidated” by the verbal statement of Lieut: “Mitchell” late of my staff &amp;c You proceed to state that “no definitive Judgement has been formed as to the circumstances above refered to’’ and that although no definite Judgement has been formed as to the occurrences above refered to,” you are yet instructed by the President to pronounce, on me what every one must conceive to be the deepest censure, and to supercede me in the command of the army. Thus inflicting the severest penalty &amp; the highest disgrace, in the power of the president to visit upon me, were my guilt established by the most incontrovertable testimony. All this is done without waiting to receive my official report, which I am called on to make without delay Now Sir should I be so fortunate as to shew by a plain statement of facts, which can be supported by the oaths of hundreds of honorable men that injustice has been done me, can the injury be repaired? May I hope for that magnanimity, which will acknowledge error, and redress wrong? My official report of the incidents of the march to, and from the Withlacoochee was made to the late Secretary of War and forwarded from Fort Drane on the 19* of Oct" last.” It was made while suffering under the most severe indisposition &amp; does not do justice to many of the officers under my command or to myself. But I did not feel culpable for anything that occured, and therefore made no defence of my conduct. Lest it should not have been received by the Department a copy is herewith enclosed. Allow me to offer a remark on the evidence on which I have been condemned. As to the “rumour” it is intangible, and I shall say nothing about it, nor are the Communications which you mention as having been rec" entitled in my estimation to higher credit, as they must have been destitute of truth—For Lieut: Mitchell who seems to have “elucidated” the whole matter and whom you seem to have considered as a member of my staff, sent on to Washington and Philadelphia by me, on business connected with the replenishing of my supplies, I must say if he made such representations, he was truly unfortunate in communicating facts. For the want of an ordinance officer so often complained of to the department by the Officers in command in Florida, I appointed Mr. Mitchell to take charge of the amunition in the same order in which my staff was announced to the army. He marched with us from Suwanee old Town and lived in the family of Gen' Armstrong * until a few days before our return from the Withlacoochee to Fort Drane, where he came into the mess with myself and staff. On our arrival at the latter place he applied for permission to go to Black creek which was readily granted He suggested that he might be of service in procuring and forwarding the clothing and Blankets which I intended to order the Quarter Master at Black creek to purchase, for the friendly Indians, as it had been represented by their commander that they were in great want of those articles. At Black Creek I understood he applied to one of my aids then at that place for an order to proceed to Charleston and Philadelphia to make those purchases. This was done without my knowledge &amp; certainly very contrary to my intention, as I did not wish him to go further than Black Creek. He has forwarded no clothing for the Indians, nor has he made any report of his proceeding. I have to request that this officer may be ordered without delay to join his company at Fort Clinch on the Withlacoochee. As to his having been sent by me to replenish my supplies, the statement is erroneous The Indians were almost naked and I felt it my duty to have them clothed on the requisition of their Commander. I shall now proceed to answer the complaints or accusations which you were instructed by the President to prefer against me in the order in which they are made. And first as it regards his “disappointment and surprise that I should have commenced the execution of a campaign of so much importance &amp; so long meditated without first taking effectual measures to secure the necessary supplies” When I formed my plan of campaign which was submitted to the Department, Micanopy but ten miles distant from Fort Drane was held as a military Post, and was relyed on as one of the depots, from whence supplies could be drawn for the use of the army while engaged in that quarter. Tampa Bay was another depot already established, and I proposed another near the mouth of the Withlacoochee, and one at this place. So soon as I was advised of the time when the Tennesseeans would leave their Cantonment in Alabama for Florida, I send an express to Col. Crane" commanding the forces in East Florida to employ the whole transport train at Black Creek in carrying supplies to Micanopy. In a few days after this I learned with surprise and embarrassment that Miconopy had been abandoned by that officer This gave the enemy undisputed possession of the country for forty miles further north. They were bravely met and fought on several occasions by Cols. Warren" &amp; Mills of Florida and Capt Thomkins” of the U.S. Artillery. But they were too numerous for our forces and I had not the means of driving them back and advancing other posts, until I entered the Country with the Tennessee Brigade. In pursuance of my plan of campaign abundant supplies of every kind were deposited at Black Creek, and Steam Boats were in readiness with which provisions and forage could be conveyed to this place in 12 hours Thus, on the Eastern margin of the Peninsula I was as fully prepared as the nature of the country would admit of, and as any Gen could have been at the opening of a campaign. On the Western side of the Peninsula I had only sufficient force to establish a depot at the Suwanee Old Town where supplies were placed for the use of the army when advancing into the enemy's country. At St Marks ample stores of every kind were deposited ready to be conveyed to the Withlacoochee, whenever the Army should advance to use and protect them. Before this it was impossible with the means which I possessed to establish that depot. On the 19* day of September I marched with the Tennessee Brigade from Tallahassee for Suwanee Old Town, where we arrived on the 24* Before I left Tallahassee in addition to the supplies at the old town, a large Brig loaded with an assorted Cargo had sailed from S’ Marks to the mouth of the Suwanee. Other vessels were known to be on their way from New Orleans with additional supplies, and the Quarter master was ordered to charter a still further number to carry the public stores from S' Marks to the same destination. The Steam Boat Minerva calculated from her draft of water to enter and ascend the Withlacoochee, then lying at Mount Vernon on the Apalachicola, was chartered on the 17" of Sept to take in a cargo of forage and amunition from one of Gen Jessup's depots on the Chatahoochee and proceed to the mouth of the Suwanee, where she was by appointment to be on the 24" of Sept The Steamboats sent me by the Government under the command of naval officers, were already in the Suwanee river, where I found them on my arrival. One of these boats, the Izard was ordered by Comd: Dallas to return to Pensacola. The other two required repairs, and their crews were prostrate by disease. I ordered the Izard to remain and permitted the other two, neither of which could enter the Withlacoochee to proceed to Pensacola for supplies and fresh crews, expecting them to return as soon as possible. But they have never yet returned to their station, nor am I informed in what manner they have been employed by Comd: Dallas. On the 29* day of Sept" Gen. Read of Florida, then at Suwanee Old Town was selected for his well established intrepidity of character, his untiring perseverence and his knowledge of the Withlacoochee to take Command of a detachment of Florida militia, and a small detachment of Regular troops daily expected from Key West to arrive at the mouth of the Suwanee, and with the Steamboat Izard and 2 large Barges, which of themselves were capable of thenaselves carrying 600 barrels of freight to proceed to the mouth of the Suwanee, where it was supposed he would find the Steam Boat Minerva, and several other vessels with supplies, and proceed at once with them all to the mouth of the Withlacoochee, only 35 miles distant, and to ascend the river with the steamboats and Barges, and establish a depot at Grahams Camp about 15 or 20 miles above the mouth. Thus prepared, on the same day the 29" of September, the army marched without a waggon train carrying ten days supply of provisions on their riding and pack horses, to attack the enemy at Fort Drane, which had been for some time abandoned by our troops— The night before, an express was sent to Major Pierce" at Black Creek, advising him of my intended movements and directing him to advance without delay with his forces, add all the transport waggons with supplies for the army, relying on the large crops of corn known to have been made at Gen" Clinchs and M*Intoshes plantations for forage for our horses. On the 1* day of October the army arrived at Fort Drane and but for the escape of an Indian from a party we surprised and destroyed about ten miles off who gave intelligence of our approach, the whole Mickosucky tribe would have been surprised and perhaps destroyed. We were greatly disappointed in finding no corn at either the Plantation of Gen! Clinch or M*Intosh. Though large crops were made it had all been destroyed by the Indians, and Cattle, which had free access to the fields— We however found an abundance of sugar cane on which our horses were fed &amp; on which they were greatly improved. The express sent to Major Pierce did not, from some cause arrive at Black Creek by three days as early as it should have done. But expecting my orders to advance, his waggons were all loaded and in readiness, and in two hours after the arrival of the express, though it was late at night, his whole train was in motion, and he joined me on the evening of the 8" of October. I reported to the Department that he brought me 7 days rations for the whole army, this was according to the report made to me at the time, but the estimate did not hold out and many of the companies received but 5 days rations. With this supply I resolved to follow the trail of the enemy in order to find his strong hold in preference to taking the roads made by our armies in former marches, and as a further security against the necessity of being compelled to fall back for supplies in any contingency I had ordered two Steamboats and several schooners to be laden with forage and provisions, &amp; to sail immediately up the S" Johns river, and come to anchor in Lake George, there to await a signal from me to advance to Volusia, only six miles distant. These orders were promptly executed. The vessels ascended and took their stations, where they remained until they were ordered by an express boat to return to Black Creek. The army marched on the evening of the 9" from Fort Drane. The trail of the enemy led us to his strong hold in the cove of the Withlacoochee. We arrived at this point on the morning of the 13* That day was spent in attempting to cross the river without success. The next morning, the 14" the army having less than two days rations to subsist on, it became necessary to march to one of the depots for relief. I found the Cove of the Withlacoochee so much lower down the river than I expected and consequently so much further from Volusia, that I deemed it impossible for the army without great distress to reach the latter place, as it would require a march of 6 or 7 days. I called a counsel of war to advise with the officers and after hearing my views they were adopted and it was almost unanimously determined, that we should march to the depot ordered to be established on the Withlacoochee. We accordingly took up the line of march for that place Major Goff of the Tennessee Brigade was sent with 200 men in advance to ascertain the situation of the depot. If he should not find it, to fire signal guns with his whole command, until he received a response from Gen. Read.” He advanced to Grahams Camp, the place directed for the depot He remained there during the night of the 15" the signal guns were fired on the evening preceding and on that morning, without receiving a reply Despairing of finding the depot, or of hearing from Gen' Read, the country being impassable by land to the mouth of the river, and having no boat to descend by water, he determined to retire, and sent an express to meet and inform me of the result of his examination. On the 16" the express met me about noon 10 or 12 miles from the point designated for the depot. The army was immediately halted. Gen' Read had not been heard from since the 29" of September, the provisions of the army were almost entirely exhausted, relief must be had as soon as practicable, or extreme suffering was the inevitable consequence. The army could not reach Grahams camp on the Withlacoochee that night. If we advanced further and spent two more days without finding relief the consequences must have been fatal. In this trying situation something must be done, and done quickly. After a few moments consultation with Genl. Armstrong and Major Pierce, I resolved to march to Fort Drane where it was certain we could get Beef, for the army and sugar cane for the horses. In this we were not disappointed, we reached Fort Drane the night of the 17" an express was sent to Black Creek to forward supplies which met the army with great dispatch and relieved its necessities. I trust I have abundantly shewn that from the state of preparation as early as the 29" of Sept that I had every reason to expect that the depot ordered to be established at Grahams Camp on the Withlacoochee would be completed by the 16" of October at least. Let us now examine the causes and which are known positively to have lead to this disappointment and to my distressing embarrassment. Before the 5" day of October Gen' Read was at the mouth of the Withlacoochee with an abundant supply of everything for the use of the army He ordered the officer commanding the Steam Boat Izard to carefully examine the entrance into the mouth of the river, then to enter and ascend to the point designated for the depot. In this attempt the Steam Boat unfortunately through mistake or accident was thrown across the Channel which being narrow, she grounded at the bow and stern on full tide, and when the water fell, she broke in two from the weight of her engine, and sunk. The destination of the Steam Boat Minerva having been changed by Gen' Jessup (certainly with no expectation that it would embarrass my movements in the smallest degree) who ordered her as I have been officially informed, by her enterprising Captain to take at least one trip to the mouth of the Apalachicola with the Creek warriors before she took in a cargo on the Chatahoochee for the Withlacoochee She was also ordered by Col. Lane" to make a second trip in which she was greatly delayed by a fall of the Chatachoochee, and instead of arriving on the 24" of Sept" according to appointment, she did not make her appearance until the 22" day of October. In the meantime Gen' Read with his usual energy and untiring perseverence proceeded to fortify a large Barge which he loaded with previsiens supplies, and was in the act of passing the bar to ascend and establish the depot at all hazards, when the Minerva appeared in view. On that very day Gen' Read aided by that invaluable officer Col Wood, a member of my staff, who had taken the temporary command of the Minerva, for this expedition, succeeded in ascending the river and establishing the depot, where there has been an abundant supply of public stores ever since Now sir permit me to ask, is the accusation just, and can it be supported in truth, that I did commence “the execution of this important campaign without having first taking effectual measures to secure all needful supplies” I answer that it is not, and the charge cannot be supported, as it is proven by the fact that the Minerva on the first day of her arrival succeeded in establishing the depot. That the Steam Boat Izard should have been lost may be attributed alone to the arrangement of the Government in selecting Naval officers to navigate Steam Boats in narrow channels and rivers, who have been instructed only in navigating ships on the ocean Had the Izard been navigated by one, skillful from long practice in the management of Steam Boats it is the opinion of Gen. Read that there would have been no difficulty in ascending the Stream It may be asked why I did not make known all these facts in my official report of the 19" of October. I answer that many of them had not then transpired, others were then unknown to me. But had they all have been communicated on that day, they could not have saved me, as the President was pleased to censure and supercede me in command of the army on rumour, without waiting for my official report. Having answered fully as I conceive the first ground of complaint alledged against me, I proceed to the second charge “That after approaching so near the enemy with so large a force, and finding him disposed appearantly to give me battle, I should have retired without a more serious attempt to cross the river and drive him from his position” In answer to this charge I say and will maintain with facts, that the passage of the river with the means I possessed, and within the time in which our supplies required it to be done, was a rational impossibility, and could not have been accomplished by Gen' Jackson himself This fact was fully ascertained at the time, and has been further confirmed to the satisfaction of the whole army on our last visit to the cove I may not speak of myself or my own desire to cross and give battle to the enemy. But I can assure the President that the brave Tennesseeans, headed by their Gallant leader were impatient at every moments delay in pursuing the enemy, and that they have never stoped at any barrier, however formidable, which could be overcome by hardy enterprise. When we arrived at the river on the morning of the 13" Gen' Armstrong and myself entered the swamp with the spies—and advanced guard. We had been induced to believe the stream was fordable and that a passage could be forced in the presence and under the fire of the enemy. Under this belief we resolved to make the attempt. The spies through mistake had preceded the guides, one of whom was a prisoner captured the evening before. A halt was ordered to give the guides time to advance to the front and take the trail to the ford. I halted myself in view of the river which was so wide from its overflowing the banks that I took it to be one of those lakes so frequently found in the swamps of this country. Gen.' Armstrong advanced with the guides to the head of the spies, and approached the supposed ford The guides entered the river. Major Lauderdale a gallant and veteran soldier was close behind them. Gen' Armstrong, than whom a braver man never lived was the first person in advance, and at the waters edge, the two front horses were already swimming, when the Indians poured in a heavy volley from the opposite side of the river. Our advance retired fortunately without any loss or injury. The fire was returned with great spirit by the spies. Gen' Armstrong rejoined me and reported the river to be at least 200 yards wide— swimming from bank to bank;—with driftwood passing rapidly down the current. I immediately ordered all the horsemen to retire from the swamp, satisfied with the impracticability of swimming the stream in the presence of the enemy. After reaching the open ground in the rear, Major Gordon most gallantly volunteered to lead his Battallion on foot to give a further examination to the river and to engage the enemy He was authorised to do so and he and his command advanced with great intrepidity to the bank of the stream, where they received the fire of the enemy, which was instantly returned and continued until they were ordered to retire, having silenced the yells, and nearly the firing of the enemy. As stated in my official report the Gallant Major Gordon &amp; three of his brave followers were wounded in this affair. The report of Major Gordon and his officers confirmed the opinion I had at first formed, that the passage of the river on horseback was impossible The next mode of crossing was by the construction of rafts. This was proposed. I have previously said that I marched from Suwanee Old Towns with no other transportation than pack horses hence we brought with us no other tools that a few axes—I called on Major Pierce who informed me that he had no others than those required by the Pioneers. We had not expected to meet with such a barrier and was therefore unprepared to overcome it. To construct rafts to land a sufficient number of men to meet a formidable body of Indians, would have been the work of some time with the best preparation. With us it could not have been accomplished before the last ounce of provisions in our Camp would have been consumed. Besides there were no suitable materials to be found in the neighbourhood for the construction of Rafts. The pitch pine it is well known will sink almost as soon as lead and the hard heavy wood of the swamp, except when it is found dead and dry is but little more favourable I have had more than one occasion in the south to make the experiment, and know that it will not succeed. But admitting for the sake of argument that a sufficient number of rafts of the best material could have been constructed, in one hour to cross the whole army at a single trip, could its passage have been effected in the presence of the enemy without great slaughter? A raft could not have been carried over in less than ten or fifteen minutes, during which time the men would have been exposed to the deadly aim of a concealed enemy. It may be said that the rafts might have been built and the men crossed over at some other point than that occupied by the enemy, but the falling of the trees and sound of the axes in procuring materials to construct the raft would soon attract the attention of a vigilant enemy, and he would be prepared to meet you wherever you might attempt to cross unless you went to some distant place. I assure you Sir that the passage of this river at any point is exceedingly difficult, and almost impossible without boats. I am aware that the President is of opinion that if we had passed into the cove, we should have found an abundance of corn, but in this he is entirely mistaken I examined the cove in person, and am well convinced that there could not have been five bushels of corn raised in it, nor was there any appearance of corn having been brought to it from any other place, which corroberates the statement of all the prisoners that they made no corn and were living alone on beef, Even this article was generally unfit for use and we destroyed hundreds of cattle which our hungry troops would not use. Our subsequent difficulties in crossing the river after the water had fallen 4 feet, proves it to have been impossible at the time the first attempt was made, as we still found it swimming in some places, and in all others deep fording, presenting a width of 220 yards, bordered on both sides with deep Cypress swamps. I have yet to speak of the stream flowing from the Lake into the river, which the detatchment of Tennessee Troops under the command of Lieut: Col: Guild attempted to cross without success on the 13th day of October This formed another barrier and with the Lake on the north and the Withlacoochee on the south constituted a defence equaled only by the cove itself. On our last visit to the Withlacoochee supposing the passage into the cove would be obstinately defended by the enemy—the Tennessee Brigade with its usual gallantry claimed the honour of forcing the passage. It was awarded to them, but while they were preparing to advance, a report from the friendly Indians sent to reconnoitre the banks informed me that 4 of their number had already crossed and could find no recent sign of the enemy. On receiving this intelligence Gen' Armstrong, Col. Trousdale" and the other officers present with the same spirit of Chivalry which induced them to make the request, knowing it was my wish in the first instance that the Regular Troops and Creek Warriors should be sent into the Cove declined the permission granted them and asked permission to seek a new enterprise at the stream flowing from the Lake and the Towns beyond it, where Lieut: Col. Guild and his brave followers had fought so gallantly on the 13" of October. Accordingly the the Tennessee Brigade was ordered to that point, they approached, in the confident expectation of finding the enemy, there strongly posted and in large force. They were disappointed. They found no other impediment to their march but the stream itself &amp; the swamps and marshes with which it was bordered on both sides. The water had greatly subsided, but the stream was wide and deep, in some places still swimming, the banks boggy, and covered with a dense undergrowth. The report of Gen' Armstrong and all the officers of his Brigade proves the impossibility of crossing, when the attempt was first made, on the 13" of October, and sustains the high character of Col: Gill for his bearing and good conduct on that day. I have already in my official report of the 27* Ulto. mentioned the destruction of the Towns beyond this stream, by the Regiment under the command of Col. Trousdale, accompanied by Major Barrow, the aid of Gen Armstrong, who gallantly volunteer his services on this occasion. I trust Sir that the difficulties which presented themselves in the passage of the river,-the want of means to overcome them, and the necessity which required that the army should march immediately to a depot for supplies, shew sufficient and abundant reasons why I did not cross the river and drive the enemy from his position. When I marched from the camp opposite the cove my route was down the banks of the Withlacoochee, merely avoiding its swamps which were impassable. I had as I have shewn a right, confidently to believe, I should find supplies in a march of 35 or 40 miles. I expected to cross one half of the army in boats at that point and in a few days march up on both sides and attack the enemy. The Idea of a “retrograde” movement had never been conceived by me or any officer of my command, I thought it best to march this short distance, on the line of the enemy's barrier to a point where the pressing necessities of the army could be supplied where a portion of it might be crossed over the river with its baggage, without difficulty, and from whence the whole force could arrive at the cove in five days, attack, and route the enemy. I deemed this more Judicious than to exhaust the last remnant of our supplies in a fruitless effort to cross the river, which in our situation was believed to be impossible Yet this charge of making retrograde movements has been made by the Department of War, sustained by the high authority of the President of the U. States, and constitutes the first sentence in the order to Gen' Jessup, by which I am superceded. All this is done on “Rumour” &amp; before a “definite judgement has been formed,” of my conduct. I believe the explanation I have given and the proofs I am prepared to offer, will not only acquit, but justify me in the opinions of all unprejudiced men. But the Judge who condemns the prisoner on “rumour” unproved and causes him to be executed before a “definitive judgement is formed of his guilt, will seldom admit on any testimony, however conclusive that the unhappy man died innocent That I did not meet with supplies on the Withlacoochee, according to my expectations, I have and still consider one of the greatest misfortunes, which could have befallen me &amp; has been a source of the deepest mortification But it was from no fault of mine for I had prepared all the necesrary means to insure success, and but for the circumstances which I have mentioned, which could not be anticipated by any one the depot would have been established before the 5th of Oct” When however I failed in all these well grounded expectations, what was next to be done? Should the army perish in the wilderness, or should it march in pursuit of food. I prefered the latter and it was done. The several complaints which you have mentioned against me, when taken collectively, amount to the charge of having made a retrograde movement before the enemy. This charge will be repelled by the united voice of the whole army which I have the honor to command, and I am prepared to meet it in such a manner as will satisfy my friends and country of the injustice which has been done me. The apprehensions of the President for the safety of the frontier, supposed to have been exposed by what you have been pleased to denominate my “retrograde movements” were entirely unnecessary and must have arisen from his want of information of my position at Fort Drane and of the fact that the last scout of the enemy had been destroyed or driven across the Withlacoochee Since writing the above I have the satisfaction to inform you that Maj Gen' Jessup has arrived at my Camp and that on this day 4” De' I shall surrender to him the command of the army in Florida. Feeling a deep interest in the prompt and successful termination of this troublesome war, I am highly gratifyed at being relieved in command by an officer of such distinguished merit. But I owe it to him as my successor to say that he may and most probably will meet with embarrassment and delays in the execution of his high trust, which have not and cannot be anticipated by the Government. He will find as others have done, that the transportation of supplies into the interior, even now, when all the depots are established and well furnished, will be attended with the most serious embarrassment, and that to keep an army constantly acting against the enemy, another force of equal size should be employed in constructing and garrisoning Posts, and in protecting the transport train in its passage. Believing Sir that I have sustained the deepest injury, and that I have been visited with the greatest injustice by the orders of the President, communicated in your letter of the 4* Ult: I must avail myself of the common priviledge, of demanding an investigation of my conduct. I have therefore respectfully to request that a Court of enquiry may be ordered to assemble to enquire into and report, on all the official improprieties with which I am charged. In making this request I have no right perhaps to offer a suggestion with regard to the time or place, when, and where the court should assemble. But it is a duty I owe myself to inform the Department, that by the fatigue and exposure I have encountered in the prosecution of this campaign, during a continued stage of enfeebled health, I have contracted a disease of the lungs, which would cause a visit to the north, during the winter months, to be attended with the most fatal consequences. It would therefore be to me a matter of vital importance that some other time or place should be selected. So soon as I shall have passed this ordeal I shall with great pleasure tender to the President of the U: States my resignation, as Governor of the Territory of Florida I have the honour to be most Respectfully Y.

<enclbody>SIR I had the honour on the 9" Inst" to inform you of my contemplated march to the Withlacoochee. On the evening before my arrival, Col. Randall the Adj* &amp; Inspector Gen' was ordered with Major Upshaw of the Tennessee Brigade to advance with the spies under command of Captains Lauderdale &amp; Wilson, and the front guard under command of Col Trousdale, and select an encampment about 4 miles from the river. In the performance of this duty they surprised a party of the enemy, killed Ten warriors, and captured eleven women &amp; children. But five of the warriors escaped &amp; several of them were traced for some distance by the blood. We learned from the prisoners that the strong hold of the enemy was immediately on the opposite side of the river, and not more than 4 miles distant, and that one of the principal negro towns, was about three miles distant, situated between the Withlacoochee and a stream flowing into it from a large lake. The next morning I attempted to cross the river but found it swolen by the heavy rains and out of its banks. The enemy was in possession of the opposite side and gave us a volley as soon as we appeared but without effect. Two hundred good marksmen under the command of Major Gordon was ordered to dismount and take possession of the bank of the river. This was done with great gallantry by all the officers and men engaged, and a partial fire ensued which continued for some time, when ascertaining the impracticability of swimming our horses under the fire of the enemy when the river was near 200 yards wide, I caused the detachment to retire. In this fire Major Gordon was slightly wounded in the breast, and two of the privates were wounded, but not dangerously. The loss of the enemy was not ascertained but supposed to be much greater than ours. On the same day Lieut: Col Gill of the Tennessee Brigade was despatched to attack the negro town above described. He was met at the stream which constitutes the principal barrier of defence, * Not found. by a body of negroes and Indians who disputed his passage with great obstinacy for one hour and a half, when the enemy was driven from his position, as it is believed with considerable loss. Several were seen to fall, and one in particular who was seen to fall from a tree Our loss was three killed. Our faithful Indian guide Billy, and privates M*Kenley &amp; Dan H. West of the Tennessee Brigade, and eight wounded, but I am happy to say none of them dangerously. The stock of our provisions being nearly exhausted we were compelled the next day to march to our supplies, having every confidence that the depot at the mouth of the Withlacoochee had been established, from which we were not more than 30 miles distant. We marched to that place for relief, but we were unable to penetrate the country to the mouth of the river and on our arrival at the lowest practicable point, not hearing anything of the party ordered to establish the depot, I was compelled most reluctantly to fall back on this place. But for this disappointment I am confident the war might have been closed in ten days. As I had expected, Col: Lanes Regiment was operating near me on the river, and has this morning united with me. On his arrival at Tampa Bay he had a skirmish with the enemy, within a few miles of the Fort, in which he defeated &amp; drove them at all points. The loss of the enemy was not ascertained, that of Col Lane was two Regular soldiers wounded. On his march to the Withlacoochee he again encountered the enemy in the Lakes and swamps of the river, In his approach the men were sometimes up to the shoulders in water, and were compelled to carry the amunition on their Bayonets With all these disadvantages he continued to advance &amp; routed the enemy from his strong position. On this occasion he had one of his warriors wounded. What effect was produced on the enemy was not ascertained, as they fled so soon as the barrier was passed. I have ordered the mounted men to fall back on Black Creek to forage the horses, which have been without grain for more than 20 days. I shall remain here with Col. Lanes command, and while our horses are recruiting, will have a large quantity of provisions despatched here, and from this, shall advance a Post within cannon shot of the strong hold of the enemy, on the Withlacoochee. This is a place of great strength from the natural barrier it presents to every approach, and where I learn from the prisoners, the women and children were concealed during the last winter &amp; spring. I have despatched an officer to ascertain the situation of the depot at the mouth of the Withlacoochee, to enable me to open a communication by land or water. I hope in ten days to be able to take the field again, and that the war will be closed in a short time" I have the honor to be Very Respectfully Y” ob" Serv" R K CALL Gen Comd" the army of Florida THE HON.

<docbody>SIR, Understanding that you feel an interest in the improvements of that part of Florida, contiguous to St. Josephs' Bay, and have perhaps been made acquainted with their wishes in that respect, I take leave to inform you, that I will present any memorial which you may choose to offer in their behalf, and I will submit to any committee of Congress your views in a less formal manner, if you prefer to communicate them. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have not the slightest feeling of hostility to the prosperity of the Town of St. Joseph, and I now avow my readiness to prevent [present] and support any measure just in itself, which you may recommend to promote its interests. I have already proposed by a resolution of the House, to the committee on Commerce to establish a port of entry and a lighthouse at that place" Feeling myself constrained at the last session of Congress, to resist the oppressive and unprecedented Legislation which was attempted to promote that place, to the injury of Appalachicola, Pensacola, and the whole Territory, the course has been construed, I am aware with a settled hostility on my part. I have no such feeling. I am willing to propose and to support an act of Congress, giving the right to the St. Josephs' company to make a rail road to Tennessee bluff" and to any other point, reserving as has been done in all other cases, the right to the Territory or state to make a canal east and west across said route as has been provided, north and south across the East Florida Rail road, in the bill which passed the Senate at the last session of which I now enclose you a copy.” To this bill has been added a clause permitting another company, if they choose to avail themselves of it, the right to make a road from the Georgia line, through the richest part of the Territory to the Appalachicola r1Ver. If you are engaged to represent the Union Rail road company, I will also present any memorial which you may desire to offer. As that company will expire by its own limitation in the next month without the action of Congress. For my views and opinions in regard to that company I have the honor to enclose you a letter I have addressed to the people of Florida, to disabuse myself of some of the misrepresentations in relation to it. * In regard to these rail road companies, I have only to say, that I have not a share of stock in either of them, and that my only object is to promote the general interest of our Territory, in which I shall be most happy to have your concurrence and support." I have the honor to be, Very respectfully, Your most ob'dt servt. JOS. M. WHITE. WM. P. DUVAL, Esq. Washington City. </docbody>

<docbody>THE HONORABLE B. F. BUTLER Secretary of War ad interem SIR/ In answer to the letter of the Honorable Thomas H. Benton, Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs,” enclosing a Resolution of the Senate, authorizing the appropriation for repairing the Sea Wall at St. Augustine to be expended in the reconstruction of the same,” and requesting the opinion of the department upon this measure, I have to state that Lieut. Mansfield, of the Corps of Engineers, having the general charge of this work, reports, that the relocation of the Sea Wall in advance is, in his opinion, indispensable; so crooked and irregular has it been built, and so badly has the work been executed. It is further stated that the foundation stone of the old Spanish wall, as well as that in front of the city; inclines several degrees towards the bay; has neither solidity or symetry to recom- mend it, and has been undermined in several places and fallen. The low water line of the bay is in advance of the wall, as it now stands, varying from 20 to forty yards, and the bay street is only about 15 feet wide. It is proposed to commence the wall from the angle of the fort; running it in a continuous line to about forty feet in front of its present position, at the south end, presenting a handsome curve and widening the bay street of the town. From the report of Lieut Mansfield it appears it would be a useless expenditure of money to repair the wall as it now stands, and therefore it would have to be rebuilt. It is presumed the cost of reconstructing it in its present condition would not materially differ from the relocation proposed. The department, however, is without the data for comparing the expense of the two operations.” The Resolution of the Senate is returned. I am &amp;c C. Gratiot. </docbody>

<docbody>DEAR SIR—I have to request that you will publish the enclosed. I regret to say that a deep excitement has been produced here by a Bill introduced into the Legislative Council, not only on account of its assumption of sovereign National authority but for other causes. It will prejudice all appropriations to carry on the war, lessen the simpathy, &amp; interest Felt for the people of Florida, and materially affect the claims depending here for indemnification. I have been told fifty times, “since your Legislature has taken up the subject, &amp; are about to dispose of captures we need not act on the subject” Four or five copies of the printed bill have reached here through some channel, &amp; you will see that the Government Newspaper has denounced it, &amp; you may judge by the tone of that article the feelings it has excited. I sincerely regret this, &amp; hope the Bill has not passed. I am very Respectfully, Your most obt. JOSEPH M. WHITE. I have procured 100 copies of the Globe of the 1st of Febuary containing the “rules &amp; regulations” for proofs of claims &amp;c. in the late act of Congress, that the people may proceed according to rule. TO THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA. FELLOW CITIZENS-Causes of a private &amp; Domestic character altogether, oblige me to announce to you, my determination to retire from the position I now occupy, as your Representative,” I shall reserve for my last official address the occasion of giving expression to those feelings which animate &amp; afflict me in dissolving the political connexion which has long so subsisted between us.” I am with profound respect, Your Obt.

<dochead>MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]</source>
<place-time><month>February</month><date>7</date><year>1837</year></place-time>
<docbody>Address To the Honorable, the Senate and house of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled The Legislative Council of the Territoy of Florida, impressed with the justice and necessity of an early and immediate action of the Government of the United States upon the subject of the losses, sustained by the people of Florida, during the Seminole hostilities, beg leave most respectfully to address themselves to your honorable body in behalf of their unfortunate constituents— In surveying the disastrous effects of the disturbances yet raging over a district of Country, rich in the advantages of nature, and but lately, smiling with all the abundance and prosperity, which those advantages procured; they have been struck with the strong Claims of their fellow Citizens upon the sympathy of their Government; which a Calm and Careful review of the relation, which this Territory occupies towards the General Government, of the Causes and origin, of the war, and of the circumstances that have marked its progress, has convinced them, of the peculiar propriety with which those who have suffered, may rest themselves upon its justice for their remuneration. It is by no means an admitted or settled principal among the writers upon public Law that a nation is not bound to indemnify its Citizens for the ravages of a public enemy. The reason assigned by those who assume the negative is not such an one as will satisfy a liberal and enlightened view of political morality; while, on the other hand, the argument that war being a public act, and as is to be presumed for Common good, the loss by destruction of property, no less than the expense, occuring in its prosecution, should be borne in Common by all the community, ought in this Government of “Equal burdens and Equal rights to give prevalence to the affirmative proposition: But be this question held as it may, the nature of the protection due to the people of Florida is of a character so entirely different, and so infinitely superior to that which the United States owe to its own immediate Citizens, as to withdraw them from the influence of principles, which, in ordinary Cases, might restrict the action of Govenment. The Citizen who suffers individual injury in his property by the operations of an Enemy may find some place to silence his murmur at the denial of reimbursement, in the reflection that as a component member of the Community, he is directly concerned in the purpose and prize of the Contest—has mediately or immediately joined in the Counsels that have given it origin, and Controlled its progress, duration, and event—and that sharing in its benefits and responsibilities, he must abide its chances; But the people of Florida are otherwise circumstanced with reference to the United States Government. They inhabit the territory of the United States, and are therefore subject to its disposition, yet participating not in its sovreignty are politically separated from its interests. They can give no voice, exercise no share, in the conduct or diplomacy of the Government—They cannot influence the policy of its administration, nor intrude upon the Councils that direct it—they are denied all part in the negociations that may result in war, or avert it, in the measures of precaution that should precede it, or in those of defence that follow—nor can they claim participation in the fruits of success. In all respects then, they are directly and completely dependant upon the United States for Security and protection from its enemies; And in proportion as this dependence is perfect and unqualified, the protection that is due them is £# This claim of unlimited protection might indeed be waived in a case in which the means and power of the Government were unequal to the obligation—but when as in this instance, the power of the United States, as compared with the force of its enemy, may be justly termed unbounded. Those who have suffered may well be excused for insisting upon its fulfilment. In this view of the obligation of the Government and the corelative right of the people of this Territory, it would be unecessary to do more than to ascertain the fact of loss, to establish their claims to indemnification. But without resting here, they may safely advance yet further in urging the strict rightfulness and peculiar equity of their claim; for without fear, they may justly insist, than even an ordinary degree of protection has Not been granted them. Upon this subject this Legislative Council, though constrained to candor, speak with reluctance. Identified in sentiment and affection, in education and prejudice with the Citizens of the States, they profess themselves in heart one people, tho' politically distinct. Thus affected, it is not readily or lightly that their consent would be yielded to the advancement of a Charge, touching most slightly the National pride. But while a sense of what is due to their unfortunate fellow citizens, compels them to be unreserved, the exalted point of view in which it is their pride to regard your honorable Body, emboldens them to be frank in the communication of their sentiments. They will be free then to say, that a deliberate and dispassioned consideration of the history of the Seminole hostilities has fixed them in the opinion that the measures of precaution for the safety of the lives and property of their fellow citizens, which an ordinary forecast and prudence would have directed, were wholy neglected;—that this neglect occured in the face of circumstances, which long before hostilities commenced pointed palply to the danger, and in despite of the reiterated and timely warning of officers, high in authority; that for an unreasonable and unjustifiable length of time, after hostilities commenced, they were left, weak and unprepared as they were, without aid, to depend upon their own resources; and that even after the attention of Government was fully awakened, and an unsuccessful campaign had evinced at once the prowess and daring of the enemy, and the dangers to which the lives and property of the inhabitants must continue to be exposed, they were abandoned and left without the necessary defence, during a great part of the Spring and Summer of the past year. In a communication of this description a detail of facts may well not well be indulged in, but the mention of one circumstance alone will tend to illustrate the justice of the preceding conclusions. They allude to the fact that immediately upon commencement of hostilities, the only company of United States Soldiery at St Augustine was withdrawn from that place, and the whole district of Country east of the St Johns remained without the presence of a single United States Soldier for nearly two months after, during which time, was enacted most of the ruinous desolation of which that portion of East Florida was destined to be the scene. If this people then, may urge that not only has full and complete protection, not been extended, but that even an ordinary degree of protection was not vouchsafed them, the establishment of the justice of their claim, it is thought, admit of much hesitancy— If any thing now wanting to strengthen the Case, which those who have suffered might present, it may well be found, in the fact, that the contest has been for soil, not for sovereignty—for property and possession, upon a question of barter between the United States and the Indians, and therefore wholy of Federal interest; and is especially one in which the interest and rights of the people of Florida were in no wise concerned. It would be most cruel then, that all the disasters and burdens, which the dispute has originated should be permitted to fall without redress upon their heads. In an other substantive point of view, it is thought that the right of indemnification is susceptible of support independantly of every other ground. The Indians inhabit the Territory of the United States and are subject thereby to its sovreignty. They have by the treaty of Camp Moultrie submitted to the protection of the United States, and placed themselves under its patronage. The United States by the same treaty assumed their guardianship. It is submitted whether the relations growing out of this state of things between the United States Government, and the Indians, do not result in rendering the United States directly answerable for the trespasses and violences of their political wards, the Indians—while the latter are doubtless responsible over to the United States for the Consequences of this liability— With great respect to your honorable Body this Legislative Council take leave to suggest, in addition to the immediate purpose of this address, the propriety of adopting early measures to secure to the United States a reimbursement of the amount which the just indemnification of those whose property has been devastated, may require, according to the well established usages of nations and the settled rule of public Law, it is undeniable, that viewing the Indians as the wagers of an unjust war, the United States have the right to cease and appropriate all that is necessary to reimburse the expenses, and indemnify the ravages, which the war has produced. The per- sonal property of the Seminoles which must fall by Capture, or by their submission into the power of the United States—the large sums of money, stipulated to be paid them in the treaty, the execution of which is sought to be enforced—and if need be, even a portion of the Territory which they acquire in exchange of the Lands they resign in Florida, will afford ample sources for complete reimbursement; And as these means will be fully, and are exclusively, within the reach and power of the Federal Government, whether availed of or neglected, the right of the people of Florida to look to that Government for the adjustment and satisfaction of their claims, Cannot, it is submitted, be avoided— Before concluding this House beg leave to urge upon your Honorable Body the necessity of an early action upon the subject of this address. The Country has been laid in ruins; its best improvements have been swept from its face; the inhabitants, many of them growing in their gradual rise to competence and comfort, are reduced to beggary; the improvements and settlements that before existed can never be renewed by the same people, until the recompence of their losses shall have been realized. In addition to this, innumerable families have been dispoiled of their head by the mischances of the war, and by the ravages of the pestilence it has produced, is that hapless widdows and beggared orphans in pitiable numbers, depend upon this resource for their relief. Every consideration of justice, of policy, and of charity even, unite in requiring a prompt consideration of the subject. Delay of justice to the sufferers will be the highest injustice, and will operate to the great detriment of the country, by preventing its speedy revival, when hostilities shall have ceased.” JACKSON MORTON Prest Legislative Council PaSSed Feby 7th 1837 JOS.

<enclbody>. SIR Your letter of the 7" inst” is before me, and I hasten to communicate that I do not feel myself authorized to suspend the execution of your contract until the ensueing fall, upon any plea of pecuniary consideration, and I feel it necessary to state that I had reported some time since to the Comm Gen' L Office that I expected that contract completed in a short time. The claimants urge its completion, the contract requires its completion, the Government expects its completion, and my duties require me to say, that I expected its completion before this time. Under all the circumstances, I must beg your unremitted attention to this duty, * Whitcomb received a recess appointment as Commissioner of the General Land Office vice Ethan A.

SIR Your letter to me bearing date 31" ult” has just reached me, and in answer have to remark—that the very great difficulty attending the survey of “Forbes Purchase,” particularly that part which is required by your department of making out exact returns, shewing the very many indentations on all the lines, also the exact area of all the purchases (say form) can be the only excuse I have in my power to offer for the long delay of handing in the returns. I have been at work night and day for some time past at my brother's, in making the drawings of the survey, is the cause why your letter did not sooner reach me. and receive that attention which was incumbent on me to bestow on it. You have been pleased Sir, to remark that—the unusual delay in filling said contract in all its provisions &amp;c &amp;c. In answer to which I have only to say that the difficulty of procuring the necessary assistants and also the long spell of sickness which I was afflicted with last summer will possibly be a sufficient apology for the delay It is only the person who performs the drudgery, who knows or who can at all possibly appreciate the difficulties which I have had to encounter in the late survey. I was not aware myself, Sir, that more and serious difficulties awaited me at my table, but those difficulties have been in a great measure overcome, and I think I may safely say, that you will be in possession of all the papers incident to the survey in the course of the present month.” I am Sir Yours with high respect (signed) CH*H GOLDSBOROUGH. </enclbody></enclosure></docbody>

<docbody>DEAR SIR: Having written three letters to the Secretary of War on the subject, I called to-day in person to see the President, to protest against any further draft on Middle Florida, and to suggest that they would have enough to do to protect their own frontiers. He declared he did not believe that Jesup had made any draft or a call for one; wanted evidence of the fact; denied that Florida, had ever had a Brigadier General's command in the field, and then becoming excited, he said “Let the damned cowards defend their country,” that he could take fifty women, and whip every Indian that had ever crossed the Suwannee, and that the people of Florida had done less to put down the war, or to defend themselves than any other people in the United States. He said they ought to have crushed it at once, if they had been men of spirit and character. He said if five Indians had approached into the white settlements of Tennessee and Kentucky not one would have ever got out alive. He said the men had better run off or let the Indians shoot them, that the women might get husbands of courage, and breed up men who would defend the country. He maintains that there never was 600 Indians. When he had finished his harrangue, which, of course, was not very agreeable to me, I said to him, your Army and all your Generals, have been in the field, why have they not conquered these 600 Indians? and why are the people of Florida thus reproached for not doing what all your regular troops, and Tennesseeans, have failed to accomplish? I told him, the Tennesseeans at Wahoo, as I was informed, had some difficulty to get their wounded off the field. Said he, “it is a lie!!” I answered I was not there, and did not state it on my personal knowledge. He then said if they had not got out of provisions, what they would have done. I told him they always got out of provisions, and were hungry in sight of the enemy. We came to no understanding. He required proof that Jesup had called for men, and I cut out of the newspaper the Report of the Committee of the Legislative Council, who waited on the Governor, and enclosed it to the Secretary. Among other things, I told him that if he would mount his war horse, after the 4th of March, I thought he could soon put an end to the war, but that it was not every son of Achilles, who could wear the armor or wield the sword of his father." I am, &amp;c. &amp;c. JOS. M. WHITE. J. KNOWLES, Esq. -: </docbody>

<docbody>SIR, The principal Chief of the Seminoles, Micconopy, is with me; he has been here since the evening before last. To day he approved the convention entered into by the 2"3" and 4" Chiefs of the Nation on the 6" inst., which I had the honor to send under cover of my letter of that date.” He requests that Captain Page *may be allowed to accompany his people to the West—If the Captain could be spared from his present duties with the Creek Indians, the service might be benefitted by attaching him to this service-Captain Bateman, who is now in the Creek country, could take his place, and Hopoeth liyoholo has applied to the President to have that Officer continued in the Creek emigrating service. Several Mickasukey Indians have come to camp to-day—Micconopy has heard from the Chief of that band, Abi-a-ca (Sam Jones), also from Oseola (Powell). Those Chiefs are both between Apopka &amp; the St. Johns; and Micconopy and Aligator have no doubt of bringing them in early next month, perhaps sooner— I now for the first time have allowed myself to believe the War at an end. The same errors, however, that renewed the War in Alabama would renew it here; I mean the imprudent violence of the Citizens. Should they attempt to seize any of the Indians either as criminals or as debtors the scenes of the last year will be renewed. If it should become necessary to protect them from such annoyance, I shall not hesitate to declare Martial law, and send every individual not connected with the public service out of the Country— I now hold the troops in such a position as to produce the best military effect. I can operate in any direction from this point and never be more than from thirty five to fifty miles from a depôt. Should the Indians not act in good faith, I shall be able to attack them on either side of me in from three to five days—with mounted men in much less time. I enclose a copy of the Instrument signed by Micconopy, confirming what had been done by the Chiefs who represented him and the Nation. Micconopy informed me last night that he had never before consented to emigrate; but that he now believed the great Spirit had so ordered, that he should leave the land of his fathers, and he submitted cheerfully. I shall discharge in a few days a Battalion of Alabama Drafts. They were called into service when our prospects were most gloomy; but they have rendered no other service than to aid in protecting the train between Tampa and the several interior depôts: they brought the measels with them, and have in consequence been entirely inefficient. I have the honor to be, respectfully, Yr. obdt. Servt. TH. S. JESUP Major Gen Com" BRIG GENL. R. JONES Adjutant Genl. Washington City [Endorsed] 43. A. 150 Head Quarters Fort Dade 18 Mar: 1837.

I will also embrace the present as a proper occasion, to caution you against making hereafter, a final settlement with any deputy for surveying, until it shall be first ascertained to your satisfaction that he has fulfilled the extent of his contract and has left no minute unsurveyed fractions, which if allowed, under the additional inducements now offered for leaving such tracts, would defeat the object of the appropriation by increasing rather than diminishing their number.

Goldsborough again to the woods, for the important purpose of connecting the public lands with the survey of Forbes &amp; Co as required in his instructions, (Wide copy on file with contract in your Office) which he failed to comply with, and which fact came but recently to my knowledge, and although minutes of the surveys supposed to have connection were furnished him from this Office to facilitate his progress. Will you have the goodness to advise me whether the expression used in your circular, the “Office to be kept open for the transaction of business” &amp;c, means only the number of hours daily that business is to be transacted in it, or that the doors are to be kept open during business hours. If the latter idea is also embraced, I would respectfully suggest, that we are from necessity in this climate compelled to keep our doors and windows closed during the hours of business, to prevent the winds from driving our papers to &amp; fro, and in the summer season, the Draftsmen have to keep water constantly at hand to wash perspiration from their hands during many hours of business.” I have the honor to be very respectfully Your Most Obd" Ser' ROBERT BUTLER JAMES WHITCOMB Esq Comm” of G.

<docbody>Sir, I had the honor to receive, yesterday, your two letters of the 20th ultimo.* The War, I hope is over: at all events there is but little danger of a renewal of hostilities, if the Troops be held in readiness for immediate action, and the inhabitants of Florida act with ordinary prudence. Should, however, any attempt be made to seize the Indian negroes, or to arrest any of the Chiefs or Warriors, either as criminals or debtors, an immediate resort to arms would be the consequence. Several of the principal Chiefs are in this neighbourhood with detachments of their people—Micconopy, Holatoochee, Yaholoochee, (Cloud) Coaco-chee, (Wildcat), John Ca-wi-ya and several sub chiefs and Warriors, left me yesterday for the emigrating camp. Co-a-co-chee is the son of Philip, the principal Chief on the St. Johns river: his influence is greater than that of his father—He is decidedly the most talented man I have seen among the Seminoles, and should, and no doubt will, be the principal Chief of the Nation—He promises that Abiacca, the Chief of the Mickasukies with his people shall come in He returns to the St. Johns to collect his cattle, and will start his father and all his people, immediately to the emigrating camp— The Chiefs entered into an engagement yesterday to surrender the negroes taken during the War. They will deliver them to the commanding Officers of the Posts on the St. Johns. The Indians generally will emigrate; but the measure will be tedious, and in all its preliminary steps, expensive—A few thousand dollars judiciously applied as a compensation to the Chiefs of energy and influence, would save in the end, and I am persuaded, fifty times the amount thus expended— When the emigration of the greater part of the Nation shall have been effected, strolling vagabonds will remain, probably, and annoy the frontier inhabitants—To restrain them I propose to re-establish Fort King, and establish a post between Fort Drane &amp; the Suwannee. Fort Drane being in a very unhealthy section of the Country, its Garrison must be withdrawn early in June. One or two posts, with small garrisons, may probably be required on the Atlantic Coast, south of St. Augustine— The garrisons of Forts Mellon * &amp; Call must be withdrawn by the 1st of June, in consequence of the unhealthiness of the sites of those forts— In regard to the topographical information which you require of me, it becomes my duty to report to you that although two officers of the Topographical Corps had been assigned to my command by orders published to the Army, &amp; both actually reported to me, one was withdrawn without entering upon duty &amp; the other a few days after he joined me. I have therefore, but few materials for a topographical scetch and memoir of the Country which has been the scene of my operations. I came hither without any knowledge of the Country—and there were no guides to be obtained on whose information any reliance could be placed. The only guides from whom correct information has been obtained are Indians and negroes whom I captured— We have possessed Florida sixteen years—During the whole of that period we have had a Topographical Corps on the Register, and borne on the Army returns; but the officers have been taken from their appropriate duties and employed upon those purely civil; the consequence is, that we have perhaps as little knowledge of the interior of Florida, as of the interior of China— I have directed my Aid de Camp, Lieut. Linnard, to collect and arrange such data as are accessible, with a view of making as com- plete a report on the subject as practicable; And I have the honor to be, Sir, Your obdt. Servt. TH: S.

They will be delivered to the Com" Officers of Posts on the St Johns. The Inds will generally emigrate, a part will, he thinks secret themselves in the swamps and annoy the citizens; for the purpose of restraining such, proposes to reestablishing Fort King, and establish a Post between Fort Drane &amp; the Suwanee.

<docbody>SIR, I have just received your letter of the 27" Ult” ” and shall answer it in detail: appending such remarks as existing circumstances seem to require, with a view to afford you all the information deemed important on the several subjects. The inclosed list hastily drawn (and possibly not free from error or omission) will give you a knowledge of the unfinished Townships west of the Suwannee River,” and there are some Islands said to be valuable between the mouth of that river and the Bay of S" Andrews. The Townships which I consider as important to be completed under the appropriation refered to I have designated thus (Bay") and all the Islands with such other Townships as you may deem important from their relative situation. Contracts cannot be entered into for any part of this work South &amp; east until assurances are had, that all danger from the Indians shall have been removed. The work bordering on the Appalachicola and west to include the 10" Range can be made the ground work of one Contract and part thereof executed this summer, the residue next fall and winter (some of it is now under water.) The residue west is not important, except a private claim confirmed to M. De. La. Carera (page 211a. of Laws 1846)," and of which no data can be found on the files of this Office to give it a location, although diligently sought after. Information on this subject is solicited. In reply to your polite and friendly caution on the subject of making final settlements with Deputy Surveyors, unless certain fulfilment of their contracts were made manifest to the Surveyor General, I would beg leave to state that under the instructions, General &amp; special from this Office, no part of a Township is to be left unfinished, although its survey may overrun the amount of Contract unless certified on the face of said Township plat under his Oath of Office that it was impracticable. I hope this precaution will be deemed sufficient by you. To enable me to make the arrangements necessary for procuring and dispatching Deputy Surveyors to their work as early in the Autumn as the climate will permit, and the removal of the Indians: will you have the goodness to advise me as early as may suit your convenience, what amount of funds will be apportioned to this Office, to govern my Contracts. It has been intimated that the Survey of Forbes claim (now under execution) will cost near Four thousand Dollars, if this be true, a further sum than that on hand in deposit will be required. Are the former Appropriations for copying field notes still subject to that object. I have a contract now under execution that will have to be suspended if necessary, on hearing from you. I addressed, long since M. Glover upon receipt of his recommendation through your Office for the Appointment as Clerk in this Office, to which I have received no answer and am unable to account for his silence.

The great body of the Seminole Nation are concentrated in that part of the Country—Powell will be highly useful in bringing the Indians in, and in hastening their embarkation”—Nothing is now to be apprehended unless it be the imprudence of Citizens of Florida—The officious interference of some of them has already embarrassed the service; and from the public papers I discover that certain citizens of Florida, who, I presume were unwilling to trust their persons nearer to the Seminoles than Charleston, are denouncing me and my measures. I have only to say in reply to them that I can have no agency in converting the Army into negro catchers, particularly for the benefit of those who are evidently afraid to undertake the recapture of their property themselves— Micconopy, Jumper &amp; Cloud are here with a part of their people— Holatoochee is collecting his people and will be in by the 20th— Aligator's people were assembled, but dispersed in consequence of a report that they were to be executed so soon as they should place themselves in our power.

In 1837 he was practicing law, apparently at Tallahassee, and was the owner of sugar lands on the Gulf (DuVal to John Campbell, Apr. 29, 1837, NA, SD, Applications). Recommendations on his behalf came from his brother, and from Robert Butler, various members of the Legislative Council, Judges Randall, Webb, and Cameron, Governor Call and others (loc. cit.). Col.

<docbody>JESUP, MAJOR GEN'THO" S. Tampa Bay, Florida. SIR: I have received your letter of the 8th. inst: * and have read with interest the copy of Colonel Harney's dispatch enclosed by you. In order that the present gratifying prospect of a speedy termination of the difficulties in Florida may not be marred, the department advises that you continue to exercise great vigilence in protecting the Indians from all violence both from the troops and the citizens, and that you take all proper measures to prevent any officious interference from any quarter, with your operations. The attacks upon your course of conduct, to which you allude, are not worthy of your notice, and it is hoped that you will steadily proceed in the execution of your important duties without regard to them; and rely upon the support of the people and approbation of the Department, to sustain you in your efforts to put an end to the war and to send the Indians, speedily and peaceably, to their new homes.” J.R.P. </docbody>

<docbody>SIR, I have just been informed of the appointment of Mr J. P. Duval to the office of Secretary of this Territory." Being one of those who recommended M” Duval for this appointment, I feel it a duty which I owe equally to the Territory, and to myself to represent his conduct to the Department, and to ask such interposition of the authority of the President in relation to him, as may be deemed proper. In January last the ill health of Mr Walker the late Secretary and my own, was such as to induce a belief that we should both be compelled to travel during the summer, and he determined to resign his office, in order that a successor might be appointed who would remain in the Territory and Administer the Government during my intended absence. He made known his views to M* Duval, who was desirous of obtaining the office, and united with myself and others in recommending him (M” Duval) for the Appointment. M' Walker then tendered his resignation to take effect on the 15" of May, last;" In the latter part of April Mr Walker was informed of the intention of M" Duval to leave the Territory, he called on him on the first of May and told him if such was his intention, he would immediately with-draw his resignation. M" Duval replied that there was no certainty of his appointment, but that he would continue here until it was ascertained, and if appointed would remain; This assurance satisfied M. Walker so entirely, with regard to the proper motives of M" Duval, that instead of with drawing his resignation as he intended, he addressed an other letter to the President on the 1* of May urging the appointment of Mr Duval and requesting that it might be forwarded to this place by the The present embarrassed and unsettled condition of the country is such as to require every officer to be at his post, and, I have again to request that M” Duval may not be permitted to evade the duty and responsibility of his office.” Very Respectfully Your ob" Sert R. K. CALL HONBLE J. FORSYTHE SecY of State [Endorsed] Write again to M' Duval stating the necessity of his immediately reparing to his Post,” &amp; to Gov. Call informing him what had been done before the receipt of his letter. M.W.B. </docbody>

<docbody>SIR, I have received your letter of the 5" ultimo,” and I have now to acquaint you with the entire failure of the scheme of emigration. Miacanopy Jumper and Cloud, with their families, were seized and carried off by a party of Warriors on the night of the 2" inst. It is stated that the Warriors have degraded Micconopy, and have placed Sam Jones, the Micasuky Chief at the head of the Nation. I believe the emigration of the Seminoles to be impracticable under any circumstances—Those who removed last year were upper Creeks, not Seminoles. The country can be rid of them only by exterminating them. I have sent a few Indian and Negro prisoners to New Orleans; and I shall immediately discharge the vessels which had been employed to carry the Indians off, and shall deposite to the credit of the Treasurer of the U States, the sums placed to my credit in the Branch of the Bank of Alabama at Mobile, and the Union Bank of Louisianna at New Orleans.” I am, Sir, respectfully Your Obt.

You will likewise in order to render your report perfectly intelligable accompany it with a connected diagram upon which you will designate the proposed new surveys by appropriate colors and if approved you will then be authorised to contract for the same according to the present practice of this office In connection with this subject you will also state such facts as may have come to your knowledge concerning the marks upon the field, of the former surveys within that portion of your District which has been of late the seat of the Indian War and which may require the action of this Office or of Congress at its ensuing session to replace such of them as may have been wantonly obliterated by the savages—And since it appears from the daily prints that the removal of the Indians is yet only in progress you will give information if in your power of the probable time that you will be enabled to send your deputies to the field for the purpose of resuming surveying operations. As regards the unexpended balances of former appropriations for copying field notes I have to inform you that they are available only if not carried to the surplus fund to prevent which it is necessary that they should be drawn out before the expiration of two years from the 31* of December following the date of the appropriation— on the subject of the disbursment of these appropriations in future and for my views in relation thereto I will refer to my communication to you of the 26 ultimo " a copy of which was addressed to each of the Surveyors General * I am &amp;" JA* WHITCOMB Com” P.

<docbody>SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 6” ins' "and to inform you that I have ordered a Deputy Surveyor to the Office for the purpose of entering into contract for the survey of the designated work west of the Appalachicola River at “augmented prices”— The residue cannot be contracted for until the Indians shall have been removed, and should that event become probable I shall forward the Diagram requested, shewing the ground of progressive surveys under my last estimate for your approval. So far as respects the Marks on the field of my last Surveys, on and near the 2" Paralel: I have no information whatever, as Oceola seems to have engaged the minds of all who approached that Country to the entire exclusion of Land Marks. I feel however fully persuaded, that it will be necessary to send an experienced Surveyor with two or three hands to examine the surveys near the Indian Boundarys with powers to renew land marks, and for which purpose provision ought to be made by Congress for a reasonable compensation whilst so engaged. Apprenhensions seem to pervade the Community that Indian hostilities will be again renewed, in which event our chains must rust for the want of use, until our worthy Red Brethren permit us to walk abroad. I have received the Treasury Draft required by you to be sent me, and from the tenor of your letter on the subject of appropriations for Copying Field notes for your office, I would respectfully request that a Draft may be sent me for the sum of Two thousand five hundred Dollars after the last day of September next, which amount will in all probability complete the copying of all the field notes in the office. I hope you will approve of the manner of disbursements suggested in my letter of 12" ins' " by the mile,” as affording a more correct and equitable mode than any other I could propose. I shall with pleasure strictly conform to your instructions to have each contract contain the T" and R* to be surveyed by each Deputy. Previous to the completion of the Contract for Surveys “at augmented prices”, I will request such a sum under that appropriation as may be demanded not wishing to have at any time, or long at a time, more public monies in my possession than the current expences of this Office requires.

<docbody>SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 13" instant,” in which, after enclosing for my consideration several papers relative to the claim of Judge Randall, for arrears of compensation, as Judge of the middle District of Florida, under the act of the 23" of May 1828," you ask my opinion on the questions whether “under the circumstances of the case Judge Randall is entitled, whilst the cases referred to are pending in his District, to the extra compensation provided by the act of the 23" of May 1828; and whether it is competent for this Department, after what has occured, to pay him without further legislation?” In my opinion, Judge Randall, so long as he has been actually employed in the discharge of the special duties imposed by the act of 1828, is equitably entitled to the extra compensation given by it; and I think it competent for the Department, without further legislation to pay him what it may find to be justly due for fer such special duties. The sixth section of the act of the 23" of May 1828 imposed on the Judges of the Superior Court of Florida, the special duty of receiving and adjudicating certain claims to land within their respective districts; and the seventh section contains the following enactment: “the said Judges shall each be entitled to receive the compensation given to the District Judge of Missouri, for the performance of the duties required by this act, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.” The thirteenth section of the act of the 26" of May 1824,” thus referred to provides “that the District Judge for the State of Missouri, shall, while in the discharge of the duties imposed by this act, be allowed at the rate of eight hundred dollars per annum in addition to his salary as District Judge for the State of Missouri, which shall be in full for his services.” The act of May 26* 1824 contains no appropriation of money to pay the extra allowance given by it to the Missouri Judge; and consequently it became necessary for Congress afterwards to make such appropriation, which was done, from year to year, as in ordinary cases; but the seventh section of the act of the 23" of May 1828 clearly contains a standing, indefinate appropriation of the money necessary to pay this allowance, enduring so long as the Judges, or any of them, shall continue to discharge the special duties imposed by the law; and therefore no additional appropriation was necessary from year to year. That Congress had the power to make such an appropriation, if they thought proper, is undeniable. It is not frequently done in cases of public officers; but the pension laws and some other acts now in force contain such appropriations under which moneys, to a very large amount, are annually paid out of the Treasury. The only difficulty in the case, and by which it is distinguished from other cases of standing appropriations, arises from the fact, that in the year 1829, the first year after the imposing of the duty, a clause was introduced and passed in the general appropriation law for the service of that year, making an appropriation for compensation to the Governor, Judges and Secretary of the Florida Territory, “including additional compensation to the Judges under the act of the 23" of May 1828;” and that clauses including the special compensation of the Judges were inserted in the appropriation laws of each year (except 1830 when the sum appears to have been granted, but without the special clause above quoted)” and until 1834,” and offered in subsequent years but stricken out in the House of Representatives. The motion to strike out, appears in some instance at least, to have been made by the Honorable C. Johnson under a belief on his part, that the special compensation should no longer be paid. It now appears, however, that the amount of special compensation given by the act of May 23" 1828 was unnecessarily included in the act of 1829 and the subsequent laws; and I cannot perceive how the allowing of it by Congress for a series of years, or the refusal to allow in 1834, or since, can affect the justice or validity of the claim of the Judges under the act of 1828. No doubt it was competent for Congress to repeal the appropriation clause of the act; as to all services to be performed after the repealing act; but there has been as yet no repeal of that clause, unless the unnecessary appropriation of the amount in 1829, and afterwards, can be considered as an implied repeal. But repeals by implication are never allowed, except when necessarily involved in the new law, which is not the case here. I lay out of view, entirely, the particular motives which induced M" Johnson to submit the motion to strike out the clause; for it is -* Mar. 2, 1829, 4 STAT. 342. impossible to ascertain, with certainly, whether or not the other members of the House of Representatives concurred in those motives; and under such circumstances, the presumption of law, is, that the clause was stricken out, because found to be unnecessary; the case being provided for by the standing appropriation in the act of 1828. And even if the other members of the House actually concurred in the views of M. Johnson, the legal character of the case would not be altered; because the opinions or wishes of one branch of the Legislature cannot have the legal operation of a repealing law, nor affect legal rights acquired under the former law. In the foregoing view of the case I have strictly confined myself to the equitable rights of Judge Randall supposing him to have performed the services since 1833, and to the power of the Department under the act of 1828; without touching the question, whether, after what has occurred, it may not be discreet to withold payment until the direction of Congress can be taken in the matter—that being a question with which this office has no concern. It is also proper to mention, that should Judge Randall receive the extra compensation given by the act of the 23" of May 1828, he must relinquish, for the time being, the increased salary allowed by the act of the 30” of June 1834.” I am Sir, very respectfully Your Obt Serv" B.

Should it be found, on surveying the tracts claimed by you, that any portion of them is held under previous Confirmations, or other title of an older date, and superior to yours, I incline to the opinion from the Consideration I have given the Case, that this Office Cannot direct the quantity of acres, within the limits of your tracts, that may be interfered with by other Claims, to be selected elsewhere for you, unless Congress shall pass an Act to that effect.

<docbody>TO THE HON: LEVI WOODBURY Secretary of the Treasury. The petition of the Subscribers inhabitants of Indian Key and its vicinity Respectfully Sheweth That the recent tragical event of the death of Capt Walton and one of his men of the light Ship Stationed on Carysford reef," by the indians within thirty miles of this place, together with the innumerable fires made by the indians all around us have caused to the inhabitants very serious alarm and constant apprehension of danger and convinced us that nothing but the utmost vigilence on our part will ensure us safety. The peculiar Situation of Indian Key renders it liable to incursions from these hostile savages more than any other location on the coast; the temptation too is considerable inasmuch as a large store is kept on the key which is at all times filled with provissions and munitions of war for the use of the inhabitants and wreckers engaged on the coast, and these facts are well known to the Indians, they having previous to the breaking out of hostilities been in the habit of trading at this store. Your petitioners would further shew that it has already cost the inhabitants of the Island and those interested therein upwards of $9000 in protecting their families &amp; property which expense falls heavily upon them and ought not to be borne by them. Unless some assistance is rendered them by the government to whom they pay burthensome taxes for steh protection, they fear all their personal efforts will prove unavailing. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honor will order a cutter properly manned to be stationed at or near Indian Key which will at the same time be a protection to Key West and the numerous wrecking vessels on the Coast."

<docbody>WALKER Esq GEO: Dist: Attorney U. States Pensacola, Florida. SIR: I have the honor to request that you will, as the agent of this office, perform a special duty in connection with the Appalachicola Indians. Enclosed I transmit copies and extracts of various letters and papers,” from which it will appear that several outrages have lately been perpetuated on these Indians by white people. The information in possession of the office is not, however, sufficiently full and explicit to enable it to judge of the proper method of interfering, or of endeavoring to procure redress for them, or of the propriety and legality of taking any measure at all on the subject. I have to request that you will proceed to the residence of these Indians and make a complete investigation of their complaints, and report all the facts and circumstances you can elicit, and your opinion as to what, if any thing, should be done in the premises. It is obviously impracticable to say to what points your enquiries shall be directed, or in what manner you shall conduct them. All this is left to yourself, with the single remark that it is desirable that the information you communicate shall be as full and as certain as it is possible to procure. While there I will thank you also to make enquiries as to whether it is probable these Indians would be willing now to dispose of their reservations and join their kindred west of the Mississippi. The enclosed copies of the treaties which have relation to these bands, together with the letter from this office of the 29th. March last will put you in possession of the necessary information respecting their rights, interests and claims. Should there be a probability of success, the proper steps will be taken to effect an object so desirable to them and to the United States. A. Smith Jr. acting agent for the Appalachicolas will be notified of your appointment, and directed to co-operate with you, and I advise that you seek an interview with him at once. A reasonable compensation for the services herein indicated will be made you, and any expenses you may find it necessary to incur in procuring testimony, hiring interpreters or for other proper objects connected with the business, will be re-imbursed. I will thank you to notify me at the earliest practicable moment of your acceptance or non-acceptance of this appointment. In the event of acceptance, you will be pleased to enter upon and complete the duties assigned you as soon as possible." C.A.H. Enclosures.—Copy of letter from this office of 29th April '37 to Arch" Smith jr." Esq, with extracts from his letters to this off. of 19 Feby,” 22nd April and 14th. May, 1837.” </docbody>

<place-time><month>August</month><date>3</date><year>1837</year></place-time>
<docbody>MAJOR GEN THOMAS S JESUP Gareys ferry. Florida. SIR, The attention of the department has been called to the subject of the aid afforded by Government to the suffering inhabitants of Florida by a late letter received by the Quarter Master General, from Lieutenant Vinton, informing him that another Steam boat has been employed to transport subsistence on the requisition of Governor Call, who alleges that the one now on that service (the Izard) is not sufficient to supply the suffering inhabitants assembled at S*Marks. You were informed by a letter of May the 17*.* that the President had resolved to continue the distribution of rations to the inhabitants who were unable to maintain themselves until the 1* of October next, and by that intimation it was intended to convey his intention that these supplies should cease at that time. The object of Congress would appear to have been to succour the immediate wants of a people, who had been suddently driven from their homes and deprived of the means of supporting themselves, not to continue during the whole war to maintain them gratuitously, thereby withdrawing all motive for exertion on the part of those who might otherwise find means to maintain themselves—Cases may present themselves of the aged and infirm, the widow and the orphan wherein you may be called upon to exercise a sound discretion as you are hereby authorized to do; but on the 1" of October, the present system of dealing out rations to the suffering inhabitants of Florida generally as now practised, must cease—And as early notice as possible ought to be given of this determination of the President. That none may suffer under this decision, you will give employment to those who are in want of it, and it is supposed that the various branches of the service, especially the establishment of stores, Posts and good communications throughout the country, will enable you to do so—Apart from the pernicious moral influence of an indefinite continuance of such a system, the success of the campaign will be jeoparded by it. If the Steamboats and Wagon train, and other transportation intended for the service of the Army, may be called off at any time from their legitimate and necessary uses, to convey these supplies, the commanding General cannot be certain of receiving with punctuality and despatch, those intended for the troops. And if the subsistence destined for the Army is to be consumed irregularly by requisitions from Officers whose duty it has been to obtain the rations heretofore distributed to the inhabitants, the commissary's department cannot answer for the result. The supply must either way far exceed the regular demand, which is attended as experience proves, with great waste of the public stores, or there may be a deficiency of supplies for the troops, to the utter destruction of the best combined operations. Even those rations which, in the use of a sound discretion you may find it absolutely necessary to distribute, ought to be taken from other resources than those intended for the use of the Army, and transported by other means than those at the disposition of the Quarter Masters department for the transportation of the baggage and stores of the Army. You will therefore cause all such persons to be assembled in the neighborhood of Jacksonville on the S" John's and at Tampa bay or Charlotte's harbor, points which can be approached by sailing Wessels and on information being received here of the number so to be supplied, measures will be taken before the commencement of active operations to detach this service from the Army altogether and employ Agents to attend to it.” J.

<docbody>JESUP T. S. Maj. Gen. Garey's Ferry, Florida. SIR, I have received from Major Graham reports of his proceedings under the appointment of agent for the Seminole emigration, conferred upon him by you, and have conveyed to him the approval of the Department. I presumed that the arrangement you contemplated, when you assigned that officer, and Lieut" Casey" and Searle " to duty in the Indian Department, had reference to the execution of the convention of Camp Dade,” and that it of course terminated, when the Seminoles broke their engagements. I therefore thought it proper to take some measures now for the removal of these Indians, whenever they should have been brought to consent to emigrate. The extent of the preparations in progress for the military branch of the service, greater than at any previous period, induced me to suppose, that the unwillingness to be troubled with the accounts of the emigration expressed in your letter of the 8th of March last,” would be increased, rather than diminished. It appeared to me desirable therefore, as a measure of relief to yourself, that an officer should be specially assigned to the duties of Superintendent and Disbursing agent for the emigration of the Seminoles. Upon enquiry I discovered a great reluctance to have Major Graham withdrawn from his duties in the field, and I also learned that Lieu" Casey's duties, as assistant Comm” were sufficiently arduous. I have therefore requested that Capt P. Morrison * might be assigned to duty in the Indian Department, and shall instruct him to take upon himself, the duties of Superintendent and Disbursing agent of the emigration. You will oblige me by expressing to Major Graham and Lieu" Casey and Searle the satisfaction of the Department with the manner in which they have discharged the duties temporarily confided to them. I will thank you to give Capt Morrison ample information of all that has been done, and to turn over to him the papers, accounts and funds in your hands, or in those of other officers, acting under your direction. In your letter of June 5th,” you expressed an intention to deposit to the credit of the Treasurer of the United States the sums placed to your credit in the Branch of the Bank of Alabama at Mobile, and the Union Bank of Louisiana at New Orleans. As no certificates of deposit have been received, I do not know whether you have done this. If you have, I will thank you to advise me at an early day. Capt. Morrison will be instructed to make his arrangements for the removal of the Seminoles, upon information to be derived from you. If he should require any assistance in the disbursing department you will oblige me by detailing an officer for that purpose. C.A.H. </docbody>

<docbody>HON: LEVI WOODBURY Secretary of the Treasury, SIR. The undersigned citizens resident in the Collection District of Appalachicola in Florida, respectfully state that great inconvenience is suffered by the Merchants of the Cities of St Joseph and Appalachicola owing to their being at this time in the same Collection District and their being but one Custom House and Collector for both. The disposition and efforts of the present worthy Collector Major G. J. Floyd to promote the interests and convenience of the residents of both places having business at the Custom House, it is true in some measure lessens the evil, but the rapidly increasing and intensive commerce and business of the River Appalachicola of which these ports are the only outlets, will soon render it out of the question for any one officer to do so, even at a greater sacrifice of time, expence and personal trouble that he now so cheerfully makes. The interests, feelings and trade of the Citizens of the two Ports are dissimilar, disconnected and distinct and require distinct and separate offices. The fact that they are supposed to be rival Towns, should we submit be sufficient to call for their being disunited as far as possible to prevent clashing of official duties and unavoidable imputations against officers. The interests of the Government also makes the division of the District and the appointment of a Collector, who should be a citizen of Florida, at each port necessary. Those interests cannot be well attended to properly by one officer however vigilant. Our Delegate in Congress will however explain to you personally our views on this, to us, all important subject more fully than we can in this Communication, to whom we respectfully refer you and have full confidence our rights and interests will not be neglected— Your ob" Sert"— Parke G.

<docbody>No 164 SIR: Your communication of the 6* Ins" enclosing an Extract of a letter from General Jesup to the Secretary of War * has been received. The Steamers American and Major Dade, have in conformity with your order been transfer’ed to the Army. The American as I understand is undergoing repairs and the Major Dade was sold as unfit for service having sunk at her anchors: The Cutters are also no longer attached to my command, having been ordered in conformity with your instructions to report to the collector at their different stations, with the exception of the Jefferson which is still at the Navy Yard under repairs. Her Commander has however been notified that he will receive orders the moment his repairs are completed. It will afford me pleasure to do all in my power to aid Gen' Jesup in his operations in Florida; I fear however that the same degree of elestreity alacrity cannot be expected from the Navy as was exhibited during the last winter. Lieut"Johnstons, Powell and Hunter rendered every service that could be asked from them, indeed more than could fairly be expected. Nevertheless no mention of their services in the many, very many General Orders lauding the merits, Bravery, Gallantry perseverance, &amp;c &amp;c, of volunteers, Militia &amp; Regular forces engaged in the War in Florida. Lieutenant Johnston has received a leave of absence from the Dep" and Lieut Hunter is the First of this ship.— The Squadron, when ordered to sea, which will be early in October, will have direction's to examine the Coast of Florida and prevent any supply of amunition from reaching the Indians. This was the case during the last winter but nothing was intercepted nor do I think that any was obtained by the Indians in the manner supposed.

<docbody>Sir, It affords me great pleasure to forward to you the copy of a letter received from the U. S. District Attorney, on the 17th instant * in reference to the intrusion made upon the public Live Oak Plantation; to which his attention for a long time past, had been drawn by my predecessor; and, myself in writing, I do not know, and of course have never conversed with that Gentleman. The notice of representations made by us collectively, and the measures adopted by you, in such orders as you may have given to the Attorney, promise the best results; Based on his opinion, I shall immediately warn Mess” LeBarron and Innerarity against tresspassing; and, will as far as the limits are ascertained, of reserved public domain, discribe them in the Newspaper, I would reccommend a furthur Critical enquiry into the manner in which these persons assumed a right of possession or occupacy, and another careful Re-survey of what they claim as theirs; Yet if their right is indisputable, our boundaries marked by the best growth of trees, ought not to be subject to injury, if not total loss, by the culpable negligence, not to say design of those appointed to protect their individual property. Since I came here the woods of promiscuous growth have been fired for clearing; and, the effect has been so far felt, as to blast numerous of our Young Live oak Growth. The appointment of a superintendant of the Plantation, taken from any class supplied by accident; and, continued from necessity; does not afford sufficient protection. The place is worth preservation, and any or all care that can be bestowed now, will reward the Navy some years hence, I think it might be convinient and desirable to some officer, a Lieutenant, disqualified for sea service to take the superintendency, on Service pay, which I think necessary, There are several such; now, borne on the Books here; He would require a Boats crew of Six men, A horse or two &amp;c &amp;c—the Crew to be imployed in trimming up—planting out &amp;c when he has no better use for them, and the season admits. The fact of an Officer being thus placed, over the Plantation; would of itself, give security. As it now is, and has been, the power of the Commandant of the Yard, only ideally reaches it. I have personally inspected the place twice, and other Officers also by my direction; from their observation; and, my own, I predicate these suggestions; You will bear in mind that I am located nine miles from the spot of which I speak, and a sheet of water, often rough, intervening The ravenous appetite for the possession of soil which has beset, and controlled other Considerations, among our people; has, I suppose, caused present Claimants, at a venture of Cost or less, to make the inroads; of which, I complain. Their pretensions, ought not only, to be set aside; I think, but a useful lesson might be taught to others; who, by their example, may be induced or seduced into like error. I may be considered as speaking very freely to you on this, and other subjects, the only apology, if any is desired, that I offer is; that, I have no local interest here to protect, nor acquaintance with the like interest of others; I act, and have only acted, as Commandant I know that my course herein; as in other instances, will add to the hostility arleady existing, against me I am, Sir, Most Respectfully Your Very Ob Servant W.

No part of this Township was ever offered at public sale and no land therein can be legally entered at private sale, consequently the sale of this section 10 as well as that of frac' Sec 1 in the same township is considered illegal and will not be sanctioned M” Walker has been heretofore advised that frac' Sect 25 in Township 2 of Range 29 W &amp; S was reserved and set apart for the purposes before mentioned I have &amp;" JA* WHITCOMB Com” </docbody>

Soon after I received your letter, in which you noticed the Subject, I saw M. Perpall the owner of the house, and he observed to me, that I must be aware that our rents, like everything else, Since our Indian War had risen in price. This is really the fact—every necessary of life, in this place, has become very high—provisions particularly, of every kind, and the owners of houses and Stores to rent, have no more Scruples of conscience than the Sellers of eatables— If we do not Soon Subdue the Indians and entirely get rid of them in Florida, we had better remove to Texas, as this Territory formerly so hopeful, has become almost hopeless. We now inhabit a very distressed and impoverished Country. I Send you enclosed, M* Perpall's letter to me respecting the increase of his rent.

SIR, In case you may suppose me too negligent (in which ’tis true I have been) in the performance of the duties prescribed to me by your Office in the year 1835, I have the honor to make you acquainted in detail with the circumstances which produced the failure in making out the returns which are usual with your Deputies. In surveying the Appalachicola River I was forced as a matter of necessity to observe the triangular mode of survey, and in so doing I must have made a considerable error and am therefore unable to form the plats, or rather close the maps in accordance with the usage of your department I have in vain tried every means to close the maps so as to make a correct survey, but find it utterly impossible. A re-survey will be absolutely necessary, and I should have undertaken it myself long since, had my health have permitted it, which has been been bad and is at this time in rather a precarious situation, and I have my doubts whether I could survive the swamps of Appalachicola were I now to go in them.

<dochead>JUDGE RANDALL TO DELEGATE DOWNING</dochead>
<source>[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.:ALS]</source>
<place-time><location>MONTICELLO Dec</location><date>1</date><year>1837</year></place-time>
<docbody>DEAR DOWNING This will be a letter of business exclusively, intended for the Delegate. I would have written sooner, but for my excessive &amp; constant occupation in my Circuit. I have just finished a long &amp; busy Term in Franklin, and am now holding Court in this County *—And this will be proper prelude to the subject matter of this letter—Cannot you get Congress to relieve me from the present onerous &amp; unequal duty imposed upon me since the annexation of Franklin County to my District?" This can be done by the reannexation of that County to the Western District, from which it was transferred without due consideration in my opinion—You know the history &amp; cause of the change—Before it occurred my District with its old limits, contained more than half of the population &amp; wealth, and a far greater proportion of the business of all Florida. What then led to the change? You will not ask this question but others may &amp; it may be briefly thus answered while the business of Franklin County was inconsiderable and the means of access to it by public conveyances only occasional &amp; infrequent, there was some irregularity in the holding the regular Terms of its Court, by the Judge of the Western District—Occasional sickness of the Judge added causes of failure also—The people became dissatisfied &amp; clamorous, for a new District to which they believed the growing importance of their County entitled them, and which they conceived its remote &amp; isolated situation required—Not being able to induce Congress to establish a new District and conceiving that any change would be acceptable, and at least quiet the clamors of the people Col" White had it annexed to the Middle District—I protested against it at the time, but only acquiesced in it as a temporary expedient—The share of compensation to me for the two Terms a year in Franklin, by the striking off two Terms annually from Hamilton &amp; Madison, was altogether illusory—Those last two Courts could be held in less than a week by a travel of 150 miles—While the two Terms in Franklin will require 20 days in Court, and a travel to &amp; fro of about 900 miles from my place of residence in the center of my District! Besides the business in Franklin already large is rapidly increasing—Let me give you a notion of my present duties—Before the addition of Franklin to my District—I held annually 10 Courts in five Counties, besides the Court of Appeals—Three of those Counties are large &amp; populous &amp; the business of their Courts considerable as you know—Now I hold the same number of Courts in Six Counties I do not recollect the number of Courts which the Judge of the Western District holds, but except in Escambia &amp; Jackson Counties, the business is trifling and the business of neither of his Courts is equal to either one of four in my present District— But I can scarcely by possibility get through all these Courts for want of time—You know that Courts can not for many reasons be held in this Territory except between about the 1st of Nov &amp; the middle or last of May—The warm weather &amp; the absence &amp; occupation of the Inhabitants &amp; sickness at other seasons limits the sessions to the above period of the year. Now this interval is scarcely sufficient to enable me to hold 10 Terms of the Superior Court, and attend for near a month on the Court of Appeals in Tall" Moreover the travelling is great, fatiguing &amp; dangerous—For instance I had to hurry frm Apalachicola to this place by sea &amp; but for a casual vessel offering to S' Marks would have been compelled to perform the voyage by sea in an open Boat—This arose from the low stage of water in the River, a casualty of frequent occurrence Now I must admit that the Inhabitants of Franklin &amp; the Lawyers of my District (whose business by the present arrangement can be more conveniently conducted,) are opposed to the seperation of Franklin from the Middle District—The Grand Jury at their late session expressed themselves to that effect &amp; may send on their general Presentment to you—But is that a reason for continuing to overtask me so unequally? By the way the Grand Jury err in their calculations of distances, and their estimate of the practicability of the routes of travel for the respective Judges to Apalachicola—From my residence in Jefferson near this place and in the very centre of my District, it is 225 miles to apalachicola, and it cannot exceed that distance from the last place to Pensacola, in the extreme western part of Judge Camerons District—Moreover by Land &amp; river travelling our routes are equal in certainty—&amp; by sea the opportunities are more favorable to Pensacola. Now my dear Sir, do attend &amp; make this grievance known—This next session of the Leg” Cl will probably lead to a seperation of Franklin into two Counties each of which will require a Superior Court—This will render the duty still more onerous &amp; insupportable. The Grand Jury seek to reconcile me to the present state of things by recommending an increase of salary for these extra duties—This I know is not to be hoped for however just—But it would not remove the objection with me to a continuance of the present unequal distribution of duties, tho' it might somewhat alleviate my disappointment in that object— Has it ever occurred to you and others to compare the quantum of labor required of the Judge of this District at the establishment of the Court—and at the present time? At first two Courts—with no Court of appeals—the business very trifling—The salary then 1500$—now the business increased 100 fold salary 1800$—I am the poorest paid &amp; hardest worked Judge on the civil list of the Federal Gov" This you know— A word more, If Franklin is to continue annexed to my District, the Act of Congress fixing the time of its session must be repealed &amp; its regulations referred to the Legislative Council—Now it comes directly in conflict both in the spring &amp; fall with my other Courts— This I suggest as an important indispensable change in every &amp; any view—Do not neglect it— Now my dear Sir, may I expect you to attend to this as not only an important private concern of mine, but as a matter of general concernment to Florida? Do let me hear soon from you on this &amp; other matters. I shall speedily, probably by the same mail trouble you with another letter to the Delegate about Court houses—jails—a Law Library" &amp;c Appropriations for all these objects have I learn been made to other Territories &amp; for the first to other Districts of this Territory—We require them absolutely for the due administration of justice"— Try what you can do—I must not however “cram you with two hot potatoes at once” as Cap" &amp; Consul O'Brien used to say * With regard Your friend TH" RANDALL P.S: I doubt if you will take the trouble to read this long letter!

Sir, At the request of many of the most influential and wealthy citizens of the County of Franklin, I beg leave to call your attention to the creation of a new Judicial District with a Judge to reside at, or in the vicinity of one of the cities of Appalachicola and St Joseph— The rapidly increasing trade and commerce of those cities render it highly important that a Judge clothed with Admiralty powers should reside at one of the above cities, where access could be easy to him and where orders could be granted and summary process awarded, frequently highly requisite in cases of maratime jurisdiction.— The importance of this subject struck the citizens of the County of Franklin in a very strong point of view two or three years since, and a strong petition was forwarded to our late Delegate praying the creation of a Judicial District to embrace the Counties of Franklin, Washington &amp; Jackson *—A favorable report ('tis understood) was made by the Committee in Congress, but the evil was attempted to be remedied by transferring the County of Franklin to the Middle District." This however failed notwithstanding the indefatigable labours and untireing industry of the Judge of that District in the discharge of his duties, and who I understand has applied to be relieved from holding his courts in the County of Franklin.—It may be proper here to remark, that that County will at the ensuing Session of our Legislature will be divided, and a law passed requiring terms of Court also to be held at S* Joseph as they now are at Appalachicola—The rivalry between those cities, their separate and distinct interests, the inconvenience and expence to jurors &amp; parties of one section of the County in attending Courts a great distance from them, imperiously demand that such a law should be passed. You will readily perceive, that in consequence of the passage of this law, heavier duties will necessarily devolve on the Judge than those already demanded of him. The products of a large portion of Western Georgia, the Eastern section of Alabama, and Middle &amp; West Florida are wafted down the Chattahoochee, Flint &amp; Appalachicola Rivers, and are shipped at the ports of App" and S" Joseph. "Tis estimated for the coming year, at least Seventy five thousand bales of cotton will be exported from those places for foreign and domestic markets beside other articles of trade amounting to four millions of Dollars, and a corresponding amount of goods imported to supply the demands and wants of the Merchants &amp; inhabitants of the interior— The Commerce arising from, and incidental to this importation and exportation to the amount in all of nearly Eight millions, necessarily creates a good deal of litigation, and questions of insurance, salvage and others and others of a maratime nature must constantly arise, requiring speedy and Summary action. As we are now Situated, we are obliged in procuring the simplest order to travel upwards of Two hundred miles to the residence of the Judge, which is beyond Tallahassee, and this with no regular mode of Conveyance.— It is looked upon as a matter of certainty, that a port of entry will be established at S* Joseph,” and in that event, the cases involving questions of infraction of the Revenue laws will be multiplied as well as those otherwise incidental to commerce, owing to therapidly increasing trade of that city, and the past warrants the assertion, that the rights of parties have been materially affected and jeopardied for the want of timely adjudication—No doubt can exist, but that the interests of Goverment would be highly subserved by the creation of the District.— The Judge of the Western District resides at Pensacola distant two hundred &amp; eighty miles from App" &amp; S*Joseph, so that we would not be placed in a better condition by being re-transferred to that District— The trade and commerce of those cities are progressing rapidly and necessarily keeping pace with the growing resources of the extensive Country tributary to them, and the present necessity of a new District will become greater and more urgent every successive year— I am Respectfully Y” ob" sert. GEORGE S. HAWKINS. Lawyer * [Addressed] To, The Hon: Charles Downing In Congress, Washington</docbody>

<docbody>HON: CHARLES DOWNING Delegate in Congress from Florida SIR, Every days transaction in the way of my Official duties as Collector of this District, convinces me more fully of the necessity of legislative action on the part of Congress in relation to the establishment of a new Collection District out of the Districts of Appalachicola and Pensacola, but especially out of the latter; for there are and always have been doubts as to the Bay of S" Joseph being in the Appalachicola District; and it was with some difficulty I was enabled to effect a decision to that effect by the Secretary of the Treasury; and I believe the actual necessities of the case (for if considered in the Pensacola District merchants would be compelled to go to Pensacola to make a Foreign entrance or clearance, a distance of One hundred miles) solely induced him to do so from official courtesy and under the strongest impression, that the application for a division would be pressed upon Congress at an early day.— Indeed, the commerce of St Joseph fully justifies its becoming a Port of Entry, for there have been several Foreign arrivals, from Liverpool &amp; Havanna and some four or five ships have been cleared for Liverpool, all which appears on the books at the Port of Entry—Appalachicola.— Present appearances induce the beleif, that S" Joseph will do the largest portion of the commerce of the App" River this Season, and I am Satisfied that at least thirty thousand bales of Cotton will be exported from this place during the coming Season and at least one third thereof carried direct to Liverpool. From these facts, the many changes requisite in Marine documents and the utter impossibility of one officer doing justice to both places and at the same time his duty to the Government, you will at once perceive the strong and urgent necessity of there being a new Collection District and a new Collector appointed—I have expressed a wish in case of the division to be appointed for the new District. I take the liberty of setting out substantially such a law as I deem proper, principally however to point out the boundaries of the New District.— “Be it enacted that all the ports, harbours, shores and waters of the mainland of Florida, and of the Islands opposite and nearest thereto extending from the Southern extremity of S" Joseph Bay and Cape S" Blas to the Eastern entrance of S* Rosa's Sound be and they are hereby, established a Collection District, by the name of the S* Joseph's District, and a port of entry shall be established at S" Joseph for said District, and a Collector shall be appointed, who shall give the same bond, perform the same duties, and be entitled to the same fees and compensation as the Collectors of the other Districts in Florida—” Possessing as you do the requisite boundaries of the District in anticipation and all necessary local information, of course the bill can be introduced without delay, the interests of this section of Country demanding speedy action— I shall leave for Washington on the 20" of this month, and Co.' Hawkins I believe somewhat sooner.—Your friends here are generally well— With sentiments of high regard &amp; esteem I am yours &amp;c GAB J FLOYD Collector [Addressed] To, The Hon: Charles Downing Delegate in Congress, Washington,— [Endorsed] Gab'J Floyd Collector St Joseph 5* Decr 1837. 488173–60-29 </docbody>

<docbody>SIR: By an act of Congress of the 28* of June 1834" the President is authorized “to remove the Custom house now established at Magnolia on the S*Marks River in Florida, to the Town of St Marks or some other point on S*Marks harbor, which may be deemed suitable where in his judgment the public interests and Convenience may require it, and after the removal aforesaid the Office of Surveyor at St Marks shall be abolished” The removal authorized by the law has been delayed at the instance of M" Willis former Collector of that District, who represented that a Rail Road was in contemplation, which if carried into effect would probably terminate at Some point on the harbor below the Town of S* Marks and would therefore in his opinion be the most suitable location for the Custom house. Nothing further however has been received by the Dept respecting this work. The present Coll" M Crane urges the removal of the Custom house to the Town of St Marks and I have the honor therefore respectfully to submit the matter to your consideration &amp; direction I am Very Respect Your Obed" Serv" LEVI WOODBURY Secy of the Treas" TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.

<docbody>DR SIR. As you have no leisure to read long letters I shall be brief—My salary as Sec” is 1500 dols my board for my family at a private boarding house is $2300 per annum, at Browns it would be double that sum. I can not keep house here for less than 4000 per annum—I know that the duties of my office whilst the Gov" is present are as light as my salary, but it should be recollected that the sec is compelled to remain at Tallahassee to play Gov" when ever his Excellency may think proper to leave the Territory, and that he should receive at least as much money as will feed him whilst waiting to discharge the duties of Gov when the Gov is absent: Whilst the SecY is Acting Gov" he should of course receive a compensation adequate to the expences of his station. You recollect at the organization of the Territorial Gov" the sec' &amp; Judges had the same salaries, but since that time the salaries of the Judges have been increased to 1800 dols besides extra pay, &amp; Judge Webb's salary te 2999 was at once made 2000 dolls—I wish you to do me the favour to endeavour to raise my salary to 2000 dolls—which will enable me to board my family with the addition of 300 dolls whilst secy and will pay half of my expences should I act as Gov". It is useless to write more on this subject you know something about the expences of Tallahassee.— I have been appointed by the Gov' to prepare the compilation of the laws of Florida or rather I have made a contract with him.” Westcott rec" 2700 dols of the appropriation and the balance of the appropriation has been transfered to the surplus fund—Westcott has been sued for the amt rec" by him, but I should be very unwilling that he or any other man should be pressed, to obtain money to pay me, and moreover there will be great delay in the publication for want of the money. It would be much better to have the balance of the appropriation which was transfered to the surpluss fund, reappropriated and also 2700 dolls appropriated by Congress at once." The whole appropriation by Congress for the compilation of the laws of the Territory was $4500. If the money could be had by May I could by that time have the compilation of the laws complete, printed and bound—I have only now the acts of 1834 to compile, having last summer compiled the acts of the previous years—You well know how much this work is wanted in Florida—At the last session of Congress some member from Mass introduced a resolution by the direction of the legislature of Mass to frank letters &amp; communications from &amp; to Gov" &amp; Sec” of the different states—Be so good as to move to have the resolutions extended to the Gov" &amp; Sec" of Territories.—You know that there would be more propriety in extending this priviledge to Gov' &amp; Sec" of Territories than of states, as the former have to transact more business in which the U States is interested than the latter—My relations Gov Pope” of Ky &amp; Claiborne” of Miss and friends from Wa Roane, Rives, Drumgule &amp;c will assist you in all these matters if you will name the affairs to them—You can not say as one of your constituents, I have refused to be represented by you, however I may have voted— Yours &amp;c JOHN P DUVAL N B. If the Blue Book comes out this winter, or has been recently published be so good as to request the Sec of State to send it to this office—we have none later than 1834: it is often wanted.” [Endorsed] John P Duval Tallahassee 20 Dec 1837 Letter of J.

Having been requested, by the Merchants and citizens of Saint Joseph and Apalachicola, to express my opinion as to the necessity of the establishment of a new Judicial District out of the middle and western Districts of Florida, I beg leave to state that great inconvenience has been experienced by myself in the discharge of my duty as Collector of the Customs for the Dis' of Apalachicola, which office I have had the honor to hold over eight years, and from my experience during this time many many cases of high importance have been neglected for want of a regular term or siting of the court, and altho the act of Congress directs the regular holding of the court in Apalachicola, yet such are the difficulties in traviling in Florida at certain seasons of the year, and the distance of the Judges so remote, that no time which they could devote to our county will enable either of them to do justice to Apalachicola The Exports and Imports from and to this county equal Ten Millions of dollars in value which it is presumed will produce the conviction in any mind of the necessity of a court, for in the transaction of business to this amount, many cases occur which require the investigation and promptest decission of a court both of a public and private nature In conclusion I will venture to say that no part of the United States is labouring under the same difficulties and inconveniences for the want of the legal facilaties to enforce contracts &amp;C &amp;C— I have the honor to be Sir Your most observant GAB J FLOYD Collr [Addressed] Honorable Charles Downing Delegate in Congress From Florida Washington City DC PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF ST. </docbody>

<docbody>To the Honorable Senate &amp; House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled The Petition of the Inhabitants of the City of St. Augustine sheweth That the sea wall now in course of construction under the direction of F. L. Dancy Esq. will prove if it be completed of the greatest benefit to the Inhabitants of St. Augustine by protecting their harbour from the destructive action of the winds &amp; waves of the ocean &amp; that if suffered to be discontinued for want of funds the utility of what has been already expended will be greatly diminished from the incomplete state of the wall. Your petitioners pray for a further appropriation to complete the said wall. they know that a considerable amount has been already appropriated, but the estimates for the work were presented in 1834.” the price of white and slave labor, provisions, &amp; materials, were so much advanced, about the time that the work commenced, that it sufficiently accounts for the appropriation being found inadequate for the completion of the wall Your petitioners further show that the wall which was commenced in 1834 by Lieut Tuttle * required to be taken away &amp; reconstructed which operation created an additional expence not included as your petitioners believe in the estimate furnished to the Government The wall cannot be said to be completed and will not protect the harbour from filling up unless it is carried up to Wallen Street 734 feet beyond the barrack wharf. three fourths of the property on this line is owned by Government and is daily washing into the harbour for want of this protection— There has been nearly completed 1600 feet of the wall which in its unfinished state has during the past summer stood the test of the most severe gales experienced for many years, the work is highly creditable to the skill &amp; industry of Mr Dancy the superintendant and your petitioners have the fullest confidence in the energy ability, &amp; integrity of that gentleman. &amp; your petitioners venture to hope that this their reasonable prayer will meet with a favorable reception and the appropriation asked for so applied as to construct at once a monument of the liberality of the United States and of the gratitude of this the most ancient city within the limits of the union * Edwin T.

<docbody>To the Congress of the United States. The petition of “The Lake Wimico &amp; St Joseph Canal and Rail Road Company” of Florida, respectfully shews, That by the Act of the Congress of the United States, approved the [blank] day of [blank]" eighty feet of the public lands is given and granted to the said company from the town of St Joseph on the Gulph of Mexico, to Tennessee Bluff or elsewhere on the Apalachacola River, for the purpose of constructing a rail road thereon, and by the same act, all the public lands, which front on the said space of eighty feet, is reserved from sale.—That soon after the passage of the Act, the Company caused the necessary surveys and estimates to be made, and early in March 1837 placed the construction of the whole road under contract, which is now on the verge of completion. That the road when completed will be twenty nine miles in length and will cost the company, exclusive of necessary buildings, Stations, Engines, Carrs, tools &amp;c, four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars.— That the country through which it passes is uninhabited, the lands poor and unfit for cultivation, being in the familliar parlance of the country, denominated “pine barren.” That the space of eighty feet, or forty feet on each side of the track, is insufficient to protect the road from obstruction and injury, arising from the casual falling of trees—. That to preserve the road from injury, to guard against accidents and give security to persons and property trasported over it, the timber should be felled to the distance, of at the least, one hundred feet on each side of the track. The said company further represents, that this important and expensive work has been undertaken and nearly finished, whithout asking extraordinary priviledges from the Territorial Legislature, or invoking the liberal pecuniary aid so often granted by Congress to encourage and promote the construction of works of this character. That the building of this rail road, and other works constructed by the said company, on and near to the Bay of St Joseph, has been the means of selling more than twenty thousand acres of the public domain, which otherwise would not have found purchasers, as the only value which these lands possess is derived from the works and improvements made by the company. That the rail road comp” merits the countenance and protection of the Government in asmuch as the road now being constructed, conects the Bay of St Joseph with the Interior. That the Bay of St. Joseph, from its position on the coast, the depth of water into it, the Perfeet entire security of the harbour, and perfect salubrity of the climate, all combine to render it of the highest importance in a national point of view, and sooner or later must receive the attention from the Government, which its position and other great advantages entitle it.—That this railroad forms the first link in the great line which is to extend from the Atlantic Ocean, across the peninsula of Florida, to the Gulph of Mexico. A work, than which, none has been designed in this country, more strictly national in its character, or which would be productive of more advantages to the country, or is more deserving the fostering and helping hand of the Government. The company, for these and other reasons entertain the hope that Congress will grant to them and their sucessors every alternate quater section of the public land which is intersected by the railroad, and the space of one hundred feet on each side of the track, through the alternate quarter sections, which will remain to the United States. The undersigned takes leave here to remark that the company desire the grant above prayed, not because the lands are esteemed of any value, except for pine timber, which in that country is valueless except to the company, for repairs to the road, and for the construction and repair of such fixtures as are necessary to the carrying on of the business of the company. The space of two hundred feet is necessary to the preservation of the work and the security of those who pass over the road— And the quarter sections prayed for will yield a supply of fuel for the Engines, and timber for the repairs and renewal of the works—While all acquainted with the country through which the road extends, must admit that the construction of the rail road, has imparted a value to the one half of the land (or rather the timber upon it) along the line of road, which the whole would never have otherwise attained—And your petitioners will ever pray.

<place-time>(<month>January</month><date>15</date><year>1838</year></place-time>
<docbody>To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled: The respectful petition of John A. L. Norman, of Florida, humbly showeth to your honorable body, that he has been engaged for three successive years, endeavoring to establish in the Territory of Florida a general system of education, by founding an institution for the educating of schoolmasters, whereby the whole yeomanry of the country might be educated; but that he has been prevented from carrying into effect the wishes of his fellow-citizens, by the insurrection of the Seminole Indians, and by which insurrection he is yet prevented. The importance of educating the whole people of our republic is a subject, it is believed, worthy the attention and action of Congress; but this, it is most respectfully hoped, is more particularly the case in the educating of an interesting and important portion of the republic, now laid waste by a desolating savage foe. Your memorialist would further urge, that Florida would, in consequence of the many lamented dead, who have fallen in their country's service, and now lie unhonored in her wilds; which dead, are highly honorable and distinguished sons of the several States of the United States, erect to their memories and worth a “mental monument,” a university, to bear their names and noble daring to posterity; which university, by the educating of the living, and by the inducing the rising youth to imitate the patriotic example of the illustrious dead, would not only be the most splendid monument that a feeling nation could erect to the fallen brave, but would be the most effectual means of strengthening and perpetuating our Union, to the latest times. The more fully to bring this interesting subject to the particular view of Congress, your memorialist would beg leave to state, that he has had three successive councils of the Territory of Florida, warmly to espouse the plan of education which he proposes, which is more fully set forth by the memorial of the council, herewith respectfully presented. Your memorialist has consulted with the officers, and many distinguished members of your honorable body, and their views have been in accordance with the desire of Florida, to the erecting of the said university. He has consulted with the generals, and the officers generally of the United States army, who ardently desire this matter, and earnestly solicit the same, that their lamented fellow-officers and soldiers may be properly honored. Their proper signatures to this effect are herewith respectfully presented. He has consulted with the generals, and officers generally, of the volunteers of the different States, and they earnestly desire Congress to grant its aid to the properly honoring the memories of their lamented compatriots. Their signatures to this effect are herewith respectfully presented. Your memorialist would respectfully present the memorial to Congress of the Tennessee brigade, under General Robert Armstrong, in the service of the United States in Florida, during the present Seminole war, praying the erection of the said university, in manner and form therein more particularly expressed. All of which is most respectfully presented.” Your memorialist would further most respectfully present the letter of request signed by the Louisiana Legislature, praying the aid and influence of the Louisiana delegation in Congress, to give their sanction and influence in Congress, to the founding of the said university, for the reasons therein mentioned. All of which is most respectfully presented. Your memorialist has also consulted with the relations and friends of the brave dead, who have fallen in the battles of Florida, and they have feelingly expressed a desire that the remains of those once dear to them by every tender tie of nature and affection, and now rendered doubly dear by the sad manner of their loss, may be removed from the wilds and morasses where they now lie, and be placed in consecrated ground, where affection may weep over them, and where christians may mourn over them. He has consulted the most distinguished citizens of the different States of the Union, both public and private, and they have invariably expressed their warmest desire that this mental monument, this university, should be erected, whereby the living might be educated, the moral condition of the people improved, the nation rendered more powerful and lasting, and the lamented dead properly honored. Your memorialist has consulted the citizens of the Territory of Florida generally, many of their signatures being herewith respectfully presented, who earnestly solicit the granting of a township of land to Florida, for the purpose of erecting said “mental monument” or university, not only for the properly honoring the worthy dead, but that the youth of the Territory being educated thereby, ignorance, vice, and infamy may not be permitted to overrun the people, and this otherwise beautiful portion of the republic become a degredation and a nuisance to the several States of the confederacy. Therefore, your memorialist prays of your honorable body, that you will grant to Florida a township of land, for the purposes respectfully prayed in his memorial, in such manner and form as your honorable body shall judge most likely to insure the desirable results therein prayed. J. A. L. NORMAN. TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA, January 15, 1838. Whereas, J. A. L. Norman has presented to the consideration of the Legislative Council of Florida, a petition praying from Congress the grant of a township of land to Florida, in manner and form therein more fully set forth, for the purpose of founding the “Dade Institute” of Florida; which, from its great usefulness and moral beauty, the honoring of the dead, and the educating of the living, which living have been made impoverished orphans by a savage foe, we think highly worthy the attention and patronage of Congress. Be it, therefore, resolved, by the Governor and Legislative Council of Florida, That our Delegate in Congress be, and he is hereby, respectfully requested to endeavor to obtain a grant of a township of land from Congress, to the trustees of the “Dade Institute” of Florida, for the purposes aforesaid.

<docbody>SIR/ I write you from the vicinity of the Indian towns on the Apalachicola river, at which I have spent several days investigating their complaints in conformity with your letter appointing me Special Agent of the War department.” With their various complaints I have made myself pretty well acquainted, but there being at this time a number of captured and surrendered fugitive Creek Indians incamped at their towns, still in possession of their arms and no military force present, I have been advised by the Interpreter that for the present, the Subject of the relinquishment of their reserves, and that of their emigration, Should not be mentioned, as it might be attended with bad consequences to both parties. So soon as this obstacle is removed, which will take place in a short time, I will urge the Subject upon them, and report to you fully on the Subject I have been informed by the 2See post, p. 464. Interpreter that the Indians have intimated to him that their lands are worth more than the price Stipulated in the last treaty, and that if the Government would give them a Sum Something larger, they would have no objection to emigrating. In antisipation of Such a difficulty, I would Suggest, whether it might not be adviseable to vest me with authority to allow them more upon the express condition of their immediate emigration The principal object however of this letter was to communicate to you certain facts in relation to the conduct of Ach" Smith, the Sub Agent, which lately came to my knowledge. For the avowed purpose of Selling Spiritous liquors, and other improper articles to the Indians, he has established a tipling Shop near their towns, at which the Indians frequently meet and become So intoxicated and riotous as to alarm the neighbourhood. With full knowledge of the fact that there were in the neighbourhood some thirty or forty Creek Indians in possession of their arms, and unguarded by a military force, he permitted the Indians of the town to purchase a large number of flints, and it is believed other munitions, at Said store. I have been also informed that he is opposed to the emigration of the Indians, and is using his influence to prevent it. In addition to these charges, I have learned from the Indians that their last annuity was paid in depreciated Bank paper, by which they conceive themselves defrauded. Should you deme it necessary to write me address me at this place (Marianna) I have the honor to be respectfully Your Ob. Sev: GEO. WALKER C. K. HARRIS Esq." [Addressed] C.A.

<docbody>SIR I have again, (and I hope finally) the Satisfaction of answering your letter of 22" Ul” wherein you done me the honor to enclose a copy of a memorial from Sundry persons at S*Augustine and which you stated was accompanied by a letter dated 1" Dec from “Mr J S Lytle" in which you will perceive it is alleged that extensive and gross errors exist in the Surveys made under your direction as regards the location of confirmed Spanish claims and particularly on the S" Johns River.” As no copy of this letter accompanied your Communication I have to predicate my answer on the Memorial alone, in which I am not able to find the opprobrious epithet gross mentioned. As my superior Officer I claim from you in strict justice, a patient and careful examination of the documents here with accompanied and otherwise refered to, from which alone, I feel safe in resting my justification, (and the imputations are politely handed back to the Springs from whence they came.) Having premised thus much, I now beg leave to call your attention to the Commissioner's letters of 18 August 1827,” and 6 June 1828° the act of Congress" therein refered to also the 12" Section of the Act app" 8" February 1827"—My letter to the Commissioner 15" July 1828” the answer 1* August 1828* My letter 1* Sept. 1828" the answer 23” Sep 1828" and the Seventh Section of the Act of 8" February 1827. the commissioners letter of 22nd May 1835," and then to my General and Special Instructions, all of which are on file in your Office.

When you shall have carefully examined the whole subject, I feel no hesitation in saying that you will approve the Vigilance which I have constantly exercised to do justice to the Government (I have faithfully Served for twenty Seven years) &amp; justice to the claimants under the Treaty, even to the injury of the faithful Officers engaged in this important, but thankless Service. I have only to regret that the lameness of the existing laws (in not compelling the claimants to come forward and identify their claims) threw my Deputies at their mercy, to numerous and vexatious delays, under heavy expenses, and in many instances, jeoapardizing the Public interest—and producing almost ruin to some of the Officers engaged and of which your predecessor M Grayham seemed well convinced as you will perceive from the correspondence first herein refered to. I will barely remark that the same apathy existed on the part of the claimants in the Western Land District untill they found (from a notice published by meat Pensacola) that their lands would have to be Surveyed as public lands, when they they turned out praise worthily, and hence we became enabled to lay down their claims, giving as I believe General Satisfaction. Not so in the East, and the Statements of the Surveyors N° 2, &amp; 3 Specify Some of the reasons, and were others at hand volumes of testimony might be adduced, and some of a Strange Character. My Report on the 3" day of January 1833” on the subject of the Arradondo grant with all the accompanying documents will afford you much information and to which I refer you.

<enclbody> SIR In answer to your enquiries in relation to the Survey of Private Claims in East Florida, I have to state that I made use of every possible exertion to survey all confirmed Private Land Claims at all times, in the different sections of country in which I have been engaged as a Deputy Surveyor Proceeding under your instructions, I could not have been insensible of the high obligation imposed upon me in surveying every confirmed Private Land Claim within the limits of my respective Districts, when the claimants came forward and furnished me with the certificates of confirmation and other documents to enable me to make the survey, pointing out at the same time the location of the land claimed, and the original boundaries if surveyed under the Spanish Authorities. I can safely affirm that I made this a solemn part of my duty in every instance, and I can confidently appeal to the people generally, in the respective neighbourhoods where I have been employed, to the truth of this assertion. Bound by contract with the Government to complete the surveys of the public land by a stated time &amp; required to separate the private claims from the public domain, I was directed by you to give every facility to the Private Claimants by advertisement and otherwise, to enable me to effect this desirable object. In pursuance of this part of my duty I made it a rule to write a public notice in the Florida Herald (a paper published at St Augustine) before commencing the survey of a contract for Surveying embracing private claims, designating the tract of country to be surveyed, and requesting the claimants to furnish me with the certificates of confirmation, a copy of their grants &amp; Surveys, if any, under the hand and seal of the keeper of Public Archives to enable me to execute impartial justice. In addition to all this I called upon personally, or notified every claimant, within convenient distance of the place of my operations, asking in the most respectful terms that they would come forward with the necessary official documents to enable me to survey their claims. In order that the claimants should have no excuse in relation to my position at different times I generally pitched my tent near the pub- lic roads, and at the most conspicuous places, and frequently walked five or six miles in the morning to commence work, very much to my embarrassment in proceeding with my public duties with the necessary dispatch. In addition to this I frequently sent one of my men, to St Augustine &amp; other places, within the limits of my surveys with a view and for the express purpose of ascertaining whether there were any claimants to be found who were axious to come forward, or send an agent to have their claims surveyed. Many of the claimants gave a deaf ear to this respectful call. My firm conviction is that many of the claimants are all together opposed to having their claims surveyed by the U States for the following reasons—Because the original surveys executed under the Spanish Authority in many instances exceed greatly in quantity the amount granted and subsequently conconfirmed by the United States, and they calculate (&amp; with truth) that their claims would be cut down by a surveyor of the United States when there was a presumption of fraud—Because there is in my opinion a strong disposition in E Florida to embarrass the surveying Department of the Government. You ask “were any of the claims enumerated in the memorial to the Commissioner, ever presented to you for survey, and their locations identified during the period you were in your district in the years 1834 &amp; 1835?—I answer by saying that I saw M. Hallows who was represented to be a part owner of the tract of ten thousand acres claimed by Fatio's Estate. I conferred with M Hallows, as well as I recollect before extending the lines of the public surveys through Fatio's claim. He said he had heard from Col White that this claim had been confirmed by the Supreme Court of the U States I have no recollection of his having produced any Official evidence of confirmation from the Keeper of the Public Archives. I am well satisfied that no such evidence was produced I saw D" Simmons after extending the lines of the public surveys thro' Fatios claim. I have no recollection of his presenting me with the official evidence of a claim with its location identified. I think he mentioned something about his having a claim within the limits of Fatios claim For the survey of the claim of R A Henderson I refer you to T 6 R26 S &amp; E, with the Commissioners Report thereon in Abstract In conclusion it is proper to remark that I frequently wrote to the Keeper of the Public Archives at St Augustine in relation to the Private Claims, and that he invariably furnished me with every information in his power throughout the whole of my surveys in E Florida. I beg leave to refer you to him on this subject. With great respect I have the honor to be Sir Your Most ob" Ser" (signed) HENRY WASHINGTON COL ROBERT BUTLER Sur Gen Tallahassee Fla.

<docbody>Public Meeting. At a public meeting held in Tallahassee, by the citizens, and others residing in the county of Leon, on the 29th day of January, 1838, for the purpose of considering certain resolution adopted by a portion of our fellow citizens, resident in Tallahassee, on the 23d instant,” after due inquiry and consultation, the following resolutions were proposed by Governor Duval, and subscribed to by the undersigned citizens. Whereas, as the resolutions passed by the said meeting, held at the court house on the 23d inst. by some individuals, may probably mislead the public mind, with regard to the energy, activity, and exertions of Governor Richard K. Call, in repressing and guarding our frontiers against the insiduous and destructive inroads of our savage enemy, and especially in stating, that said meeting “believed that no steps had been taken to apprise Maj. General Jesup of the renewed hostilities on our borders, and whereas, it is believed, no adequate measures have been adopted, to secure the permanent protection of our citizens, of Middle Florida,” all which may be implied, that gross and criminal neglect on the part of the Executive of this Territory. Be it therefore resolved, that the sentiments expressed by the meeting of the 23d inst. are not the language of a majority of our citizens, and we view with regret and pain, that any misconception should have arisen from the said resolution. 2d Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that our chief magistrate, has done all that he had the power or means of effecting, in providing for and giving protection, not only to our frontiers in Middle Florida, but in West Florida, and without any aid, in men or money, from the General Government, the Executive of Florida, with the brave volunteers, who came at his request, have manfully and efficiently defended our frontiers as far as it was practicable, with the means at his command. 3d Resolved, That it is known to many, at this meeting, that near one week previous to the resolutions of the 23d inst. that Governor Call had authorised Gen. James Gadsden, to raise an efficient corps, permanently to defend the frontier of Middle Florida, and had pledged his private fortune to pay the brave men who might volunteer in this service, if the General Government or the Territory of Florida, should not provide for their compensation. 4th, resolved, That we have undiminished confidence in the virtue, capacity, energy, and ability of Gov. Call, to protect and guard our frontiers, and that he has done, and we believe he will do, all that, with his limited means, any man can accomplish. 5th. Resolved, That the delay of the Secretary of War, to have the Florida troops paid, who were ordered into service by the Governor, has presented serious embarrassments to the defence of our country, and cannot be justified.

<docbody>PREAMBLE AND RESOLUTION No. 8. WHEREAS, it is important in all new countries where the population (as in Florida) is rapidly increasing, and especially under a repub- lican government, which is based and relies for its stability upon the general intelligence and virtue of the people, the source whence all political power eminates, to provide as early as possible, and in the most ample manner which the circumstances of the community will permit, for the education of the rising generation: And whereas, Florida is almost entirely destitute of the necessary means for that purpose on the account of the sterility of a considerable portion of the sixteenth sections, which have been reserved for the support of Schools, and in consequence of a large portion of the country having been granted to private individuals by the British and Spanish Governments, before its transfer to the United States, without any reservation of school lands: And whereas, also owing to the great extent and conformation of our sea coast, the number of islands adjacent thereto, and the numerous large rivers and lakes with which the interior of the county abounds, there are, and necessarily must be, a great many fractional townships in this Territory, containing less than sixteen sections each, none of which have any school lands. It is therefore Resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, That our Delegate in Congress be requested to use his exertions to procure the enactment of a law, authorizing the selection, in such manner as the Governor and Legislative Council shall direct, other lands in place of such sixteenth sections, as shall prove to be of little or no value on account of the sterility of their soil, or other cause, and also the selection and location of a quantity of lands equal to one thirty sixth part of all the lands which may have been granted out as aforesaid by the British or Spanish Governments, and of the said fractional townships, and authorizing the sale of said lands, and of all other lands appropriated for the support of common schools in this Territory, in such manner, and upon such terms, conditions and provisions as are prescribed to the State of Ohio, in An Act entitled An Act to authorize the Legislature of the State of Ohio to sell the lands heretofore appropriated for the use of schools in said state, approved 1st February 1826.” And it is further Resolved, That a copy of the foregoing Preamble and Resolution be signed by the President and Chief Clerk of this Legislative Council, and transmitted forthwith to the Hon. Charles Downing, our Delegate in Congress. Adopted 30th, Jan. 1838.—Approved 2d, Feb. 1838. [Endorsed] N° 8.

<docbody>To/ THE HONORABLE CHARLES DOWNING Delegate to Congress. SIR. The Undersigned, Judges of the Court of Appeals of Florida, would respectfully represent, through you their Delegate, to the Honorable The Congress of the United States, a difficulty under which they labor, in the discharge of their duties, which they humbly conceive, it is competent and proper for the Congress to remove. They allude to the pressing want of an adequate Law Library, during their Sessions at this place. That a Law Library, commensurate in extent with the variety of legal questions, submitted to an Appellate Court, and always accessible to its demand, is of indispensible necessity, to the efficient discharge of its duties, no one can deny. And it is only necessary, to reflect upon the variety &amp; extent of the powers &amp; duties, conferred on this Court, to arrive at the Conclusion, that a Library comprehending all the branches of Law, Submitted to its cognizance, must be large and expensive. As a Municipal Court, in the last resort, having appellate jurisdiction over all the other Courts of the Territory, which possess the Most unlimited Chancery and Common Law powers, both Civil and Criminal the Scope of its jurisdiction equals in these particulars that of any of the higher Courts, of the States of this Union; and as an appellate Court in instance and admiralty causes, and in all cases in which the United States is party, it has superadded to its functions, those of the District and Circuit Courts of the United States. Causes of this last description are of frequent occurrence, and at the present Term of this Court, several most important causes in Admiralty have been submitted to its decision. For the full investigation of all these important questions, the want of an adequate number of Law books is most Sensibly felt. The reasons for this deficiency, are most obvious. Other important State &amp; Federal Courts, are situate in large Cities in the older States, where, if no public Libraries furnished by Governments, Exist, there are found ample private Libraries conveniently accessible to their judges. But even for the use of Courts thus circumstanced, it has been found needful to establish distinct Libraries for Such Courts. Here in a new Country &amp; in a Small village, (both however rapidly advancing in improvement,) in books as in all other conveniences and “appliances” to the arts &amp; sciences, the demand far exceeds the Supply Private Libraries, in this place, are Small. The Judges and Lawyers assemble here from very distant places, with no convenient means for transporting their books—Moreover, in this place where Admiralty causes do not frequently originate, there is an almost Intire absence, of books of Admiralty and Commercial Law, from private Libraries. They beg leave to represent this, most urgently, as a very great inconvenience, under which this Court has long labored—They can not flatter themselves, that any degree of industry &amp; application, or that any Extent of judicial Knowledge can Surmount it, and Enable Judges laboring under such a privation, Satisfactorily &amp; correctly, to discharge their duties, and as, this Court, from the infrequency of Appeals to the Supreme Court of the U States, (owing to the great delay &amp; Expense incident thereto,) is virtually in many Cases, a Court of the last resort, errors unavoidably arising from its decisions thus disadvantageously made, May become in Some instances irremediable. The Undersigned therefore request, that you will obtain from the Congress an appropriation Sufficient to purchase for the use of this Court, an ample Law Library—For this they understand there is a precedent in a Similar appropriation for the New Territory of Wisconsin. The Undersigned would not institute an invidious comparison, when the allowance in Each case, is dictated by reasons of Sound policy, but if any more cogent reasons can be required for such an appropriation, they exist in relation to the Courts of Florida, from the greater scope of their powers &amp; duties— As germane to this matter, the Undersigned beg leave also, to ask your attention, to the application already made, by the District Judge of Middle Florida, for an appropriation, for finishing or fitting up the Court House, now building at this place, and which the local authorities have not the means to complete. In addition to the reasons advanced by the Judge of the Middle District, the Undersigned would urge, that such aid from Congress would furnish the Court of Appeals, with a Suitable Court room &amp; officers, with no further expense to the United States, which hitherto, they could not procure at this place,  although great charges have been necessarily incurred by the Government, for very inadequate accomodations to this Court.” All of which is most respectfully Submitted by your ob" Ser" THOMAS RANDALL JAMES WEBB J.

<place-time><month>February</month><date>5</date><year>1838</year></place-time>
<docbody>Memorial. To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled: Your petitioners, citizens of East Florida, beg leave most respectfully to represent to your Honorable body, that a law has been introduced, and is likely to pass through the Legislative Council of this Territory, calling a convention to form a State Constitution,” pre- paratory to the admission of the entire Territory into the Union as an independent State Government. Against this measure your petitioners beg leave to enter their most solemn protest. Under the Spanish dominion, East and West Florida were governed as separate and different Provinces, and Pensacola and St. Augustine were the Capitals. One situated on the Gulph of Mexico, and the other on the Atlantic, the points to which the business and intercourse of the respective Provinces tended. When they were organized by our National Government, they were both included in one Territory, and the Capitol was established at Tallahassee, a distance of 250 miles from the extreme of West Florida: about 750 from the extreme of East Florida, and 200 miles from the nearest point on the Atlantic shore. To East Florida, this organization has been most peculiarly harrassing and vexatious. Our people have been connected with, and in part governed by, a territory of country possessing a large majority in numerical strength, and with which they had no association or business connexion, and have been so disconnected from the Legislature, and remote from its place of session as to be nearly excluded from all its benefits. The Territory that is now attempted to be forced into a State against our best interests is about 900 miles long, varying in breadth from 30 to 160 miles; a line drawn through the interior of the country, equidistant from each border, would exceed 1000 miles in length. In a new and partially settled country as this is, destitute of roads and facilities of communication, it is easy to see the immense expense, trouble and inconvenience which a large portion of the population must suffer in their business connected with legislation and the administration of a State Goverment. The burthens that will be cast upon our people, are truly alarming, and we cannot forbear our remonstrance in the most unequivocal terms. Nature never intended that East Florida should be formed into a State with Middle and West Florida.—Its geographical position presents an insuperable objection. It is only necessary to cast the eye over the Map, to see that at no distant day a separation must from necessity to take place. At this time, and while we remain a Territory, the process is simple; erect the whole into a State and the fabrie measure is more intricate, critical and dangerous, and its accomplishment more tardy and troublesome. Suwanee River, situated about one hundred and fifty miles East of the former line between the two provinces, presents a good and natural boundary. It leaves both in the best possible form for States, and would leave in East Florida about five thousand of the present population of the Territory. East Florida would then be about 700 miles long, and its mean breadth, one hundred and fifty miles. West Florida would then have about 500, and East Florida 1000 miles of sea coast. Let it not be supposed that our numbers are too diminutive for notice. The best and by far the richest portion of this country, has been under the dominion of the sons of the forest. Their proximity to other lands not actually occupied by them, made settlements too dangerous to be multiplied. Remove them, and our numerous harbours and rivers, the climate, products, and other advantages, will present too many inducements for this region to remain desolate. No doubt remains among the intelligent, that in three years our population would entitle us to a place in the Union. Neither do we see that Middle or West Florida will have any good cause to complain. Our population forms at this time so inconsiderable a portion of the whole, that it cannot very much retard the attainment of their darling object of becoming a State. By the time this Constitution shall have been formed, their census taken and their scheme ready for execution, their increase will probably exceed our present numbers. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray your Honorable body to pass a law erecting and organizing that portion of Florida which lies East of the Suwanee River, into a Territory, separate and distinct from the other parts of the Territory of Florida—and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.” ST.

Anticipating the speedy change of our Territorial to a state Government we apprehend the creation of an additional number of officers will add to that influence which may have diliterious influence in modelling our new Goverment so as to secure the continuance in power of those who may then be incumbents.

<place-time><month>February</month><date>13</date><year>1838</year></place-time>
<docbody>HON CHARLES DOWNING House of Representatives. SIR, In reply to your letter of the 6" instant," I beg leave to inform you that immediately upon the receipt of the intelligence of depredations having been committed by predatory bands of Indians upon Middle Florida, instructions were sent to General Jesup," calling his attention to that part of the Country, and directing him to detach part of his force for the protection of that portion of the territory— a copy of this letter is communicated herewith. It appears from a letter received from Paymaster Massias," that General Call was charged by Major General Jesup with the defence of West and Middle Florida, and if this circumstance had been made known earlier, there would have been no delay in the payment of these troops—General Call as Governor of Florida has the undoubted right to call out the Militia to repel hostilities, and to protect the inhabitants from imminent danger; but this Department has no authority to pay troops so called out without the sanction of Congress. If the Governor had been vested with the authority to call out troops by this Department, then their payment follows as a matter of course—If he had been authorised to do so by the Major General commanding, to whom the defence of Florida is entrusted, there would have been no necessity to recur to this Department, as that General ought to have ordered the payment to be made immediately— but when troops are called out by Governors of States or territories without other authority than the circumstances of the case furnish, the previous sanction of Congress is necessary to authorize this department to pay them. Major General Jesup left a large force in his rear for the protection of the frontiers of Middle Florida—Properly distributed, it is deemed to be amply sufficient for that purpose. If it shall appear to him not to be so, he is instructed to authorise Governor Call to raise a force for that purpose. It would be injurious to the service in the opinion of the Department, to give direct authority to any other than the Commanding General to provide for the defence of the Territory of Florida."

Whilst at Tallahassee (about a month past,) on a visit for the improvement of my health, I was informed by the Authorities there, that the Indians had recently burnt some houses and killed several persons, about twenty miles from that place, and that there was no sufficient force in the neighbourhood which might readily be called into action, to repel any further aggressions.

<docbody>We the undersigned planters of Jackson county understand that during the time our mutual friend Mr. White was delegate an appropriation was made for the improvement of the Chipola River." We are of opinion that several thousand dollars remain unexpended and respectfully request that you will apply to the Secretary of War and ask that he will direct the balance to be expended under the direction of Maj. Graham of the Top. Engineers in cutting out and removing the Natural Bridge—an obstruction of four or five hundred yards, occupying the whole river and over which high waters flow. By reference to the map of the Territory you will perceive the locality of said obstruction—If this were removed the river would be rendered navigable for many miles rendering most of the richest land in the county convenient to navigation, as it lies above the said Bridge. If practicable we should be glad to get an additional appropriation of five thousand dollars, but if not to be had, we hope the Secretary will direct that the said balance should be expended in the manner above mentioned.” Your early attention to this matter is most respectfully requested.

<docbody>SIR, Upwards of six hundred Indians and negroes have come in, and I expect daily accessions to their numbers. On the 1* instant I sent an expedition to the head of New River under Major Lauderdale; * and I have since sent a force under Lt Col° Bankhead" to Key Biscayne, to enter the Everglades, should it be necessary to do so, in order to force the Indians who have sought refuge there to surrender. I have ordered that the Indians be attacked if they fail or refuse to come in.” Br Gen' Eustis " has been detached to the North frontier of the Territory to provide for its security; for it has been recently ascertained that about the time the Cherrokee force closed, the Miccasukeys broke up into small bands and dispersed themselves along the Wethlocoochee, the lower Ocklewaha, and the Waccasassa; and the Tallahassees went to the Annustaliga." Sam Jones retreated South with about eighty warriors, but the greater part of them were fugitive Creeks. The Indians are now spread over more than five degrees of latitude in small bands of from five to fifty men women &amp; children. Their object is to hide and elude us until the approach of the sickly season shall compel us to withdraw the troops from the interior. Colonel Taylor has established a post on the Okeechobee, and has detached Major Loomis,” with a hundred &amp; fifty men in boats to endeavour to find the outlet from that Lake into the Pahāi-Okee. More than a hundred of the Indians now in the vicinity of this Camp had for more than a month been between Colonel Taylor's force and mine, so intirely concealed by the Swamps, that no trace of them could be discovered. Col" Taylor pursued a considerable force recently—they disappeared, and we now learn that they are on the Western side of the Okeechobee. There are no means of finding or concentrating the Indians, except by messengers of peace. If they could be once collected, I have no doubt many might be induced to emigrate, whose relations have already gone to the West: but, disbursed as they are at present, it would require at least two or three months to assemble them. The difficulty of obtaining supplies at this post, (they have to be brought in small boats more than half the distance from Indian river Inlet,) will probably compel me to abandon it, and either go down to New River, or fall back to Fort Pearce. I will endeavour to hold on, however, until all the Indians South of this point &amp; north of New River be brought in. I am, Sir, respectfully, Your Obt Serv" THO S.

<docbody>SIR, Six hundred and forty two Indians and negroes have come in to this post, and I have directed that about a hundred more who were on their way hither from the swamp of the Okeechobee, assemble at Fort M*Rea 1" on that lake. With one of the parties that lately came in was a nephew of Aligator: him I have sent on a message to that chief, who, I have ascertained, is now west of the Okeechobee with his people; and who is represented as desirous of peace. I have authorized him to send his people to one of the posts on the Coloosehatchie, and have invited him to meet me here—If he come, I have great hopes of securing his influence in favour of emigration. If it be found impossible to emigrate any considerable body of the Indians, I shall in the absence of instructions, assign them a district for their residence, and let them know that the treaty for their removal is not to be changed, but that its operation is merely suspended, and that it will be enforced on the slightest depredations being committed by any one of any of the bands of Indians composing the Nation—thus holding the whole accountable for the conduct of each individual. I would not advise the Government to go farther than this: and on a careful consideration of the powers with which I am invested, I consider that I have the right to make such an arrangement. By no other than peaceful means can the Indians, dispersed as they now are over more than five degrees of latitude, ever be concentrated—if it should occupy the whole season to concentrate them, and another season to remove them, or to induce them to remove, the measure would still be the best that could be adopted—two, or at most three, regiments, with the knowledge we have of the country, would be sufficient not only to concentrate them, but ultimately to remove them. Under no circumstances would I advise the assembling of a large Army again in Florida–Under no circumstances, if the measure above suggested be adopted, can it be necessary—By disease, capture, and battle, the Seminoles and Miccasukeys including their negroes have lost, since the commencement of the War, more than five hundred warriors—those that remain have lost all their property except their rifles, and are now fugitives, without a home or a resting place. If they continue hostile, even fifty of their number may be extremely troublesome to the frontier as much so as the whole body, and much more difficult to follow and find. It has been said that the national honor forbids any compromise with them—can there be a point of honor between a great nation and a band of naked savages, now beaten, broken, dispirited and dispersed? I think those who believe so form a very low estimate of national honor. But admit that our national honor could be tarnished by giving up the contest entirely, and forming a new treaty with different provisions from those of the existing treaty—we are surely at liberty, without compromising our honor, to adopt those measures whether of direct hostility or of policy which shall promise the greater probability of ultimate success. If the Indians were concentrated and allowed to make a single crop, and at the same time all trade with them in arms and ammunition were prohibited and prevented, they would soon demand removal: and a single regiment stationed within striking distance of their position, could at any time compel them to remove. The Government surely would make no sacrifice of national honor by granting the boon of one or two years residence to the Seminoles, on a tract of land, and within limits designated and defined by its own agents The Seminoles have been as completely beaten, both in the last compaign and the present, as they were beaten by General Jackson. They have been pursued farther, and more dispersed, more of them have been killed, and more prisoners have been taken. They have been as completely beaten as the Western Indians were by General Wayne or General Harrison—and were I permitted to make a treaty on the terms on which those Generals treated, permanent peace could be secured in a week. I, as well as my predecessors in command in Florida, have failed to catch and remove the Seminoles to Arkansas; but it should be remembered that we are the only commanders who have ever been required to go into an unexplored wilderness, catch savages, and remove them to another wilderness. Search all history and another instance is not to be found. To beat the whole body of the Indians six hundred regular troops have at any period of the War been sufficient—twenty thousand would not be able to catch them. To persevere in the course we have been pursuing for three years past would be a reckless waste of blood and treasure; and I sincerely hope that I may soon receive instructions to adopt the course I have recommended, or if I should act without instructions, that my measures be approved *—and I have the honor to be, with most respectful consideration, Sir, Your Obt.

<docbody>SIR I am informed through the Receiver of this place that charges have been prefered by John G. Gamble Esq against his official conduct also implicating myself in the following manner “It is matter of complaint that Citizens have applied to enter Lands—their money was refused—and after having converted their Bank Notes into Land office money, upon another application for Land, they have found it entered by the Receiver or by his clerk H R W Andrews” This Charge is incorrect, if such complaints have been made they were without any foundation whatever, I have been engaged as Clerk for the Register for the last two years during which time I have made several entries in my own name and in company with M J Allen but in no instance have either of us entered Land that had been applied for, although applications are made almost daily for Lands without the applicants completing their entries, The course pursued in the Registers office in regard to the issuing of Applications is, to issue only one application for the same piece of Land on the same day, Should the Applicant fail to complete the entry before Nine Oclock the next morning then the same Land is subject to be entered by any other person, during the time I have been in the Registers office No Person has been refused an Application for Land subject to entry. Where Application has been made for the entry of Lands and the Applicant failed to complete the entry in proper time I conceive D* Allen or myself have a right to enter the same Land, Although cases of this kind occur almost daily we or either of us have in no instance interfered with Applicants in this manner. The Tallahassee Bank Bills were received in payment for land and recognised as Specie according to a distinct understanding between the Receiver and the officers of both Banks (as I was informed by the Receiver prior and subsequent to the suspension of Specie payment) until about the 5" or 10" of May last at which time the Union Bank of Florida suspended Specie payment, and Mr R B Copeland who was then Clerk for the Receiver during his absence to Mobile for the purpose of making a deposit, received the Union Bank Bills at par for a few days after its suspension. Mr J G Gambles charge must apply subsequent to the Union Banks suspension as the exchange of money was unnecessary before, By reference to the returns at the General Land office from this district which have been forwarded up to the 1* inst. you will not find an Acre of Land entered by M J Allen and myself jointly or by me individually or by myself and any other person And I defy the world to say with truth that I have in any manner entered Land in my own name—in company with any person or persons, procured or permitted any person or persons whatsoever to enter Land for me, or purchased Land from any person since the suspension by the Union Bank, On examination of the entries during the same period I find M J Allen has entered only one quarter Section which will be found by reference to N° 7361 That Land has not been applied for by any other person for the last Eighteen Months to my knowledge” Very Respectfully Yr Obt Serv" H R W ANDREWS LEVI WOODBURY Esq."

<docbody>To The Senate &amp; House of Representatives in Congress assembled— At the late session of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, I had the honor of submitting to that body a Project of a Rail Road to connect the waters of the Atlantic with those of the Gulf of Mexico *—Though the object was deemed not exclusively local, but general in its character, bearing with like benefit upon the commercial interests of the whole union, as upon the Territory through which the Road was to pass; I selected the action of the Legislative Council, in the first instance as probably more sure, and certainly as most speedy, to give impulse to the work contemplated—There was not a dissenting voice, I believe in either the Council or the community, as to the great importance of the Rail Road connection which had been suggested-Disagreement of opinion however, as to the measures necessary to carry out the problem, led to a suspension, for the time, of all Legislative action in the Territory on the subject—The Resources of Florida were not, at this crisis considered equal to the undertaking; Private enterprise though encouraged by a charter had faltered, if not failed, and the proposal to permit the Union Bank of Florida, assisted by the credit of the Territory, to build up the road, seems not to have met with sufficient approbation to secure the Agency of that institution—Believing as I do that the project is viewed with a most favourable eye by all who have directed their attention to the subject—; That it is one in which the commercial interests, as well as the military &amp; naval protection of the country is much involved, I have presumed to bring it before the Congress of the U States, under a confident hope that some action on their part may be obtained at the present session sufficient to give impulse to the design, and to strengthen the public confidence in its commercial importance &amp; practicability— It would be superfluous to enlarge on the benefits of the project— A mere inspection of the map will exhibit the facilities, for rapid and certain intercourse, it will present between the Two great sections of the U.S. the Atlantic &amp; Gulf Frontier— The circuitous navigation of the dangerous coasts &amp; keys of Florida may be thus avoided, and the Two Great Emporiums of American commerce New Orleans &amp; New York, be brough from 4 to 5 days nearer to Each other—Whether therefore we consider, the shortning the distance between two extremes of the U States; the great facilities presented for the rapid transportation of the mails, Troops armamements of war &amp;c &amp;c, and the additional security offered to Travellers &amp; goods by a conveyance exempt from the circuitous &amp; dangerous voyage around the Cape of Florida: they all with our imposing influence recommend to the serious attention of Congress, the importance of a High Way of Rails from the Atlantic to the Gulf Waters— It is well known what expenditures have been encurred by Government &amp; what examinations have been made to effect the same object by a Canal &amp; had the Report of the Engineers been favourable as to its practicability, an intercourse across the Peninsula of Florida might long since have been secured—on the practicability of the proposed Rail Road there is no doubt— The partial examinations which have been made have resulted most favourably as to the character of the ground, &amp; the facilities which the Country affords in materials &amp;c—Most of the distance will be a plane, and no inequalities of the interposing country can possibly present inclinations beyond the easy performance of Locomotive Power— Could Congress therefore be induced, at this session, to make an appropriation for a survey &amp; location of the Route of a Road from the Gulf to the Atlantic, and pass an act granting to any company, which may be incorporated, the right of way &amp; a certain extent of ground on each side for the road through the Public Domain; it would so strengthen &amp; encourage the public confidence in the project, that little doubt would remain, but that at our next session of the Legislative Council of Florida, impulse &amp; organisation would be given to some action, by which private enterprise &amp; Territorial resources might be made available to the accomplishment of the work recommended—All of which is respectfuly submitted by JAMES GADSDEN [Endorsed] Col.

<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY R. K. CALL Governor of Florida. Tallahassee, Florida: SIR, Within the last two or three months, the Department has several times, received intelligence of depredations committed by the Indians in Middle Florida, and has called the attention of General Jesup to them, and given particular directions for the defence of that portion of the territory. Recent information of further depredations, render it necessary that some further steps should be taken, and I have the honor to inform you that, the Commanding Officer in Florida has this day been written to, and directed to send an Officer of rank and intelligence, to that section, with such part of the regular force as can be spared, for the purpose of preventing a repetition of these depredations, and, if possible, to capture or destroy the lawless marauders who commit them. The regular force that this Officer may be able to take with him, may not be sufficient for the accomplishment of the objects in view, and it may therefore be necessary for him to apply to your Excellency for a portion of the Militia to aid him. In this event, I am instructed by the President to request that you will place at his disposal, such an amount of force of this description, as he may require, to serve three months, unless sooner discharged.” S.

<docbody>SIR I feel it but justice to myself to address you, on the subject of certain charges made against me (as Receiver) by John G. Gamble. I will commence by exposing what (in my opinion) were the true motives of Col° Gamble in becoming my accuser, and firstly he is a violent opponent of the present administration as he was of that of General Jackson, where as, I have been its uniform supporter, since the commencement of Gen' Jacksons first administration, and contributed my mite to his first election. Secondly, he is irritated with me for the free expression of my opinions, of the violated pledge of the officers of the Union bank of Florida (of which he is president) to pay in Specie or its equivalent my deposits made with them prior to suspension. Thirdly, he made a proposition to me throug a third person (some time prior to the date of his charges) to transfer to the Union bank all the Specie received at the Land office in exchange for Treasury notes, and I suppose was irritated at my refusal. And lastly he is desirous of Substituting for me (as Receiver) M. Copeland * brother in law of John Parkhill Esqr the latter cashier of the Union bank, who is also a warm opponent of the Administration, and who I am informed (Unofficially) is an applicant for the appointment should a vacancy OCCul". I would draw your attention briefly to the charges of M" Gamble, and to my refutation of them, I have divided those charges into three, First my having exacted an onerous and oppressive discount on the bank note currency of the country, from persons entering lands; for a refutation of this charge. I refer you to the statements enclosed in my letter to M'. Woodbury of the 17" Ult.* and to the certificate of M*Andrews date the 5" instant * and enclosed in my letter to Mr Woodbury of the 19* * (to the truth of which I could obtain abundant other testimony if deemed requisite. For a refutation of the 2" charge concerning my entry of lands previously applied for (of which I feel myself wholly incapable, and which if true you would not find me attempting a defence) I refer you to my statements mentioned above, to the letter of Mess" Andrews &amp; Hackley to M* Woodbury of the 5" enclosed in my letter to the later of the 19* inst., and to the returns from my office to the Commissioner of the G.L. Office which will prove that all the entries I have made were prior to the suspension of Specie payments, and when I was receiving the currency of Tallahassee at par with the exception of one quarter Section which had not been applied for by any other person as proved by the letter Mess" Andrews &amp; Hackley (referred to above. And lastly I would refer you to my letter to M. Woodbury of this date * stating that I had told the persons paying me the 15 proent (at the time of making their entries) that I would return it on their paying me Government funds, and that I am perfectly willing now to do so.— I feel much more indignant at the attempt to injure my character, (which has been sustained to the age of 38 without blemish) than at that to effect my removal from office, and would respectfully refer you to the recommendations which induced your predecessior in office to confer on me the appointment.” With best wishes for your health and happiness, and my continuance in office, I subscribe myself very Respectfully y' friend &amp; Obed" Serv't MATTHEW J.

<docbody>BREVET BRIG GENERAL. Z. TAYLOR Tampa Bay. Florida. SIR, I am instructed by the Secretaly of War to inform you that, General Jesup has recently forwarded to the Department a petition of certain Fishermen,” employed by, or connected with, Captain William Bunce, by whom they have been concentrated on an Island in the bay of Tampa. The object of the petition is to obtain the revocation of an order given by General Jesup, that their wives and families, who it appears are of Indian blood, and members of the Seminole tribe, should, because thereof, be sent to New Orleans to be transported with others on their way to the West. The General, in his letter transmitting the petition, has given his reasons for taking this measure, which satisfies the Department of its policy, and it must, therefore, be persisted in, at least, for the present. The return of the families in question, may become a subject of future consideration; but, until a final pacification of the territory, they must remain away; and it would be better for the peace of the country, if the petitioners would accompany them. The tenor of this communication you are requested to communicate to Captain Bunce. I transmit you a copy of General Jesup's letter above mentioned, from which you will perceive that, he suspects the fishermen alluded to, of improper conduct, and the propriety of keeping a watchful eye upon them."

<docbody>WALKER GEORGE Marianna, Florida. SIR, I now proceed to answer your several letters of January 25th," March 12th " &amp; 13th 1838,” and at the same time, to communicate to you the views of the Department respecting your future proceedings in regard to the Appalachicolas. The Secretary of War is of the opinion, that under the existing treaty, the United States can pay these Indians for the portion of their reserves still retained only in proportion to the amount stipulated to be paid for the whole; and that if they accede to this, they will be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the treaty with the Seminols of 1832." These have been communicated to you, and you will therefore be prepared to explain them to the Appalachicolas, and ascertain their determination. This is the only proposition the government can now make to them, and it is for them to decide whether they will accept it or, in view of the removal of the majority of the Seminoles, take the alternative of remaining subject to the laws of Florida, without an annuity, without claim on the care and pro- tection of the general government, and with no means of support but the proceeds of the balance of their reserves, and the residue of the annuity, then to be advanced to them. This is plainly stated, not for intimidation or coercion, but simply because it is the literal meaning and scope of the treaty. It is believed however, that admitting, for the moment, that the cession of their lands and their removal may be considered by them as hardships, yet that their eventual and permanent prosperity will be promoted thereby. The experience of the Creeks and Seminoles, who have emigrated, put this matter beyond question. Whatever conclusion they may arrive at, it should be the result of their free deliberation and action. I do not think a preliminary exploration of the country beyond the Mississippi necessary, even if there were means applicable to the expenses. Its character and capabilities are so well known, as to warrant the assurance that the lands assigned them, are well suited to their wants and pursuits. You will lose no time in bringing this subject before them and reporting their decision. A copy of your report on the case of the Slaves of Econchatimicco" has been sent to Congress, for such action as that body may deem proper. Under date of April 20th, M. Smith wrote " that the person, to whom you directed him to turn over the public property, had refused to receive it, and had left that vicinity. I presume you will have adopted the necessary measures in this contingency under the authority heretofore given you. The annuity will be permitted for payment as early as practicable after the appropriation is made.” C.A.H. </docbody>

<docbody>To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled The Petition of the undersigned inhabitants of East Florida most respectfully represents That the inhabitants and others who are desirous of entering lands in said District are subjected to great expence &amp; inconvenience from the location of the Land Office at St Augustine This City is situated at a great distance from the part of the Country in which lands are the property of the United States and subject to entry Your Petitioners believe that it will be found correct when they state that not one acre out of a thousand is public land that is situated East of the River St Johns; and the country bordering said River on its Western Bank from the mouth to its head, is entirely covered by old claims, derived from grants from the British and Spanish Governments, and therefore not subject to entry as public land The establishment of the land Office therefore at St Augustine operates as a grievous tax on the inhabitants of the Counties of Alachua, Columbia and Hillsborough, who are compelled to travel from One to two hundred miles to make the most trifling entry Your Petitioners are informed that the practice universally adopted in the Western States is to locate the land office in the centre (as near as can be done) of the lands subject to entry and sale They therefore most respectfully request that this subject may be taken into consideration by the National Congress, and that the land office for the Eastern District of Florida be located at Newnansville in the County of Alachua, and your Petitioners will ever pray &amp;c— John E.

<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY R K. CALL Governor of Florida. Tallahassee, Florida. SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12" instant," expressing your readiness to comply with the requisition made upon you, by direction of the President, for such Militia force as the Officer, charged with the defence of Middle Florida, may find it necessary to call for; advisory of the flight of the Creek Indians assembled for emigration to the West; of the consequent alarm of the citizens; and of the measures you have taken for their protection, consisting of the employment of a portion of the Militia, and of the Apalachicola Indians. These measures, you express a wish, may be approved by the Department, under the impression, it is presumed, that such approval will legally entitle the troops, so employed, to compensation from the United States. The laws relating to the employment of the Militia and volunteers, prohibit the payment of any by the Government, except those regularly mustered into, or out of, the Service of the United States, under directions from the President, the Secretary of War, or a general Officer of the regular Army; so that the formal approval by the Department, of the measures alluded to, would not effect the object, for which it is inferred, you desire it. The only way, therefore, in which the Department could legally bind itself for the payment of the troops in question would be to have mustered into the service, those still employed, and to have mustered out, those who have been dismissed, if they would assemble for that purpose; and General Taylor, who has full power, under his instructions, to employ such an amount of force, and to make all other arrangements, necessary for the defence of Florida, will be written to, and authorized to adopt the above course.” J R P </docbody>

<docbody>BREVET BRIG GENERAL Z. TAYLOR. Tampa Bay, Florida. SIR, Letters have been received from Governor Call, informing the Department, that there have been some disturbances in West Florida, and that he has therefore, called into service, a militia force—In reply he has been informed that, the defence of Florida has been entrusted to you, and that he must address all applications in relation to that subject, to head quarters—There appears to exist a disposition on the part of the Militia of Florida, to rush into the service—No doubt their motives are highly laudable: but the gratification of their wishes must be governed by the exigency of the service, and the means at our disposal—The estimates and appropriations, if they be made, are all based upon a diminution of the expenses of this war. The number of mounted men, must be very much reduced, and the whole Militia force ought not to exceed one thousand men. The law under which the Executive is authorized to employ volunteers, expired on the 1" of May last, and those now in service, must be put on the footing of drafted Militia, until the passage of an act, renewing the power. No volunteers, therefore, can be received into the service, and whatever additional force you may require, must be raised by drafts on the Militia, according to law. General Jesup states that, you will require a Sea Steamer. If so, you had better place the Poinsett on the duty, for which it will be wanted, as I am desirous to avoid the additional expense of purchasing, or freighting another Sea Steamer. J. R.

<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY R. K. CALL Governor of Florida. Tallahassee, Florida. SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 20" ultimo,” and its enclosures, on the subject of the appearance of Indians in West Florida; of the fears of the inhabitants, of depredations from them, and of their desire to be protected by a Military force. From your letter it appears that, your Excellency is still under a misapprehension as to the power of the Department to make provision for the subsistence and payment of Militia called out by you for the defence of Florida. This is not a matter in which the Department can exercise its discretion, it being limited to making provision for the maintainance of those troops only, which are regularly mustered into the service, and for the payment of those so mustered into, or out out of, the service, under directions from the President, the Secretary of War, or a General Officer of the United States Army. It is still further restricted by the want of means to provide for but a very limited force, as it is with the greatest difficulty that appropriations can be obtained of Congress for even the smallest possible amount of force necessary for the execution of its duty of protecting the inhabitants of Florida and elsewhere. Hence the necessity of vesting the calling out of troops, and taking other measures, involving expense for the defence of Florida, only in the general in Command there. Ample authority has been given to General Taylor, to take every measure in his power, to afford protection to the inhabitants of that territory, as you have already been advised, and it would save time and risk, if, in all exigencies of the kind, presented in your letter, you would apply to him for the necessary force; when he could either regularly raise additional force, so that it could be maintained and paid without difficulty by the United States, or more to the point when it is required, a portion of that already in service, and thus save the heavy expense of employing new troops. Immediately on the receipt of your letter yesterday, General Taylor was advised of the grounds for apprehending disturbances in West Florida, and he will, without doubt, take such measures in reference thereto, as the circumstances may require.

I propose leaving this in the early part of next month. The Government of the Territory during my absence will necessarily devolve on the Secretary M. J. P. Duval, and it is important that he should remain at the seat of Government, in order to discharge the duties of the Executive Department. Having absented himself from this place on the 11" Ultimo without apprising me of his intention, I have to request that he may be ordered to return forthwith and remain here during my absence. I have received no communication from him on the subject, but I have learned from others, that he has gon with his family to S" Joseph, where it is his intention to spend the summer. For the discharge of the duties of his office, his residence might as well be at Boston or New-York as at the place he has selected. The people of the Territory have a right to calculate on finding the Public officers, at the Posts assigned them by law, and they should be required to remain there, while on duty * I have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your Obt Serv" R K CALL HONB JOHN FORSYTH Sect” of State [Endorsed] Rec" 26 July M" Dickins</docbody>

<docbody>SIR Your letter of 16" ult°” has been received in reply to mine of the 12” Feb’ last,” and I feel gratified to receive your assurance, that your Office has not regarded either the memorial or letters from St Augustine" as an attack upon my standing as a public Officer, and when you shall have fully examined the subject, you will readily believe, that my Deputy Surveyors have faithfully executed their instructions by cutting down Frauds and, otherwise surveying all claims that were identified sufficiently by owners or agents to render their location practicable, and on this particular branch of the subject, the decision of the Land Commission, approved by the Department and embodied as a quotation in my special instructions referred to as on file in your Office will carry conviction to the mind of Col Andrews or any other person, that his statement does them very great injustice, in direct opposition to the PS attached to his letter of 27" Jan' last to M* Moore." I do not hesitate to assert, from what I have heard and seen, that a large portion of the private claims originally surveyed (and many pretended surveys subsequent to the issuing of the grants) contain within their limits some 100 some 50 or less per cent over the amount of what the grants call for, and hence they refuse to have their Grants run out. I have been the subject of proposition for accomodation from that quarter of Florida. I feel my integrity in arms against every intimation that squints towards me, and in the papers of the Aredondo Report referred to, my Deputy proved himself beyond the power of accomodation from his shewing. Another attempt was made to furnish one of my Deputies with a legal opinion contravening his instructions, which he unfortunately refused to receive, as it would be no doubt very edifying to the Department. Col Andrews seems to think my Deputies were not to blame because “they went according to the best lights they had at the time”. Those lights are found in the General &amp; Special Instructions, with particular charges to perform their duty faithfully, and if any further light could have been given them under the laws and my instructions, I would have felt myself indebted to Col° Andrews, or to any other person for a knowledge of it. They were at least furnished with sufficient light, approved by the Department, to protect the Government from great impositions On the subject of remedy, I would most earnestly and respectfully suggest, that innumerable difficulties will ensue if this country is again thrown open for resurvey; for private claims will be springing into existence through the Judiciary for years to come, and the only proper salvo that has occurred to my mind, would be found in an Act of Congress, providing for the location in one body when practicable of each grant not surveyed, to include the improvements (if any) and confined to the lines of the public surveys as already run; and where that it is impracticable so to locate the whole amount of the claim, the residue to be located on lands of the U States within-miles at the selection of the claimants and if not agreed to on their parts, that under a constitutional provision, their lands be taken for public use at valuation under sworn non resident appraisers. These suggestions are given you for what they may be worth, and I believe the Government would stand justified from the failure of the claimants to have their lands run out as provided for by the Acts of Congress under the Treaty, and the instructions founded thereon, with the repeated notices furnished from this Office. M Graham proposed to Congress at my suggestion a compulsory law upon claimants, but too late for that body to act upon at that session, and it has not been renewed. On the subject of your remark relative to M' Moore that I “do the principal Clerk of this Office great injustice, by supposing that he has been in private correspondence with Col° Andrews &amp;c”; will you be kind enough to read my letter and see whether my expression is not as follows; “but it appears that Col Andrews is in minute correspondence with the principal Clerk in your Office on the subject of my official duties.” I ask you Sir for copies of all correspondence touching this matter to and from your Office. From that part of M* Lyttle's letter wherein he says “Col" Andrews will write to Mr Moore fully on the subject I could get the whole town to sign the memorial, but I am satisfied that all you require is a knowledge of the fact”; does not all this presuppose an understanding, and he is satisfied to furnish you all you require: but Sir you have set this equivocal language upon a sure foundation, &amp; I would be the last man on earth to withold from you or Mr Moore, the withdrawal of any expression founded on misconception, and I tender you my thanks for the opportunity. I wait with composure your final opinion on my Report, conscious of my integrity in the performance of public duty, however frequent the attempts have been made by designing men to wrest from me my just rights and reputation, as well in the army, as in the station I now hold; but the time is not distant when truth will cast her mantle and shew her realities I have the honor to be, very respectfully Y."

<place-time><location>TALLAHASSEE</location><date>21</date><month>August</month><year>1838</year></place-time>
<docbody>SIR, The deep interest I feel in the termination of the War with the Seminole Indians, and the length of time through which it has been protracted, induces me to address you on the subject, and to offer such suggestion for its future prosecution, as has been presented to my view, from an attentive observation of its whole progress. It is now nearly three years since the commencement of this harassing, and disastrous conflict, and although many battles have been fought, and many of the enemy have been killed or captured, a force still remains which from the nature of the Country no less than from the character of the Enemy forbids the hope that it will terminate under the present system, without yet a long and continued struggle, a cost increased, in the loss of life, and expenditure of the public Treasure. In the progress of this War our best Generals and our best appointed arms have been employed with little success, though all has been done which skills, energy and untiring perseverance could accomplish. The object which ever sought has not been obtained. So far from removing the Indians from the land of their Nativity, our froniter Settlements have receded before the fire and sword of the Enemy, and his dominion has been extended over a large scope of Country, from which the white man has been expelled. The destruction of the houses and other property of our citizens has caused them to retire further into the interior of the Settlements to seek for shelter and for subsistence. They cannot like the savage feed on roots, and game, with no other covering than the heavens to shelter them. Such too is the situation of our soldiers, without the food to which they have been accustomed, they are unable to perform service. Their supplies are procured from a distance, and are carried into the interior with great difficulty and expense. The most secure hiding places of the enemy, cannot be penetrated except on foot, hence the provision of the soldier must be conveyed in his knapsack, and when his supply is exhausted, he is compelled to retire from want of food, leaving the enemy in his undisturbed possession of his native fortresses. It is not from numbers, superior bravery, or skill in the use of Arms, that the Seminole has thus long been enabled to resist our power, but from the nature of the country which he inhabits—The difficulty of procuring supplies for our Army—The effect of the climate on his pursuers, and his act [art?] and success in evading pursuit. Experience has taught him that he has only to avoid battle, and the best, and the most numerous and best appointed army conducted with all the skill and energy necessary for success, will be exhausted and subdued by the fatigues and privations of the march. Secure in his ability to avoid pursuit, the passage of our Army through his country, exists but little apprehension. He knows that from want of supplies, it must soon retire, leaving him again indisputed master of the field. He has already experienced every calamity, but the loss of life. His nation has been broken and bisbursed into small fugitive bands, his villages and houses have been burned, his fields laid waste, his cattle destroyed. But the ravages of War has left him an unsubdued wanderer, armed for destruction— Every swamp, and every hammock gives him shelter, and gives him food. The wild potatoe, the wild Arrow-root, the Cabbage Tree, Palmetto and the Briar root, every where abounds From most of these flour is extracted by a simple process, which furnishes an wholesome and nutritious food. The woods furnish him with game and the waters with an exhaustable, supply of fish. Hence, want and famine the attendant consequences of invasion in every other country, and with every other people has no terrors for him; The spontaneous products of nature supply him with abundant and congenial means of subsistence, the Swamps and hammocks are his barriers of defence, and while he flies before invasion, his subtle stelth and cunning, enables him to surprise the unsuspecting traveller, and to visit the frontier settler with destruction, when least expected, then he is most to be feared. And now after a sanguinary conflict of near three years, after our Army has swept over every portion of the Enemy's Country, and every house and village has been destroyed, there is not a family along our whole line of settlements, for than more two hundred miles in extent, that is not nightly exposed to destruction, and scarcely a week passes by, without adding to the long and melancholy list of those who have perished by the hands of the savage. My observation on the result of the measure heretofore pursued for the removal of the Indians, have brought me forcibly to the conclusion, that it cannot be accomplished without a change of policy, so long as the Indians are determined to resist—It is not by the march or countermarch of Armies through the Enemy's country, that he is to be expelled, for he has only to conceal himself for a few days, and the Army exhausted with fatigue and hunger, retires before him without the fire of a gun. The forest must be subdued before the Enemy can be finally conquered. Every inch of ground taken from him must be firmly held by permanent settlers, who will cultivate the soil, and make the wilderness their home, Under this system there is every reason to believe that the Savage would gradually retire before the approach of the civilized man. that he would be compelled to abandon every portion of the country which is susceptable of cultivation, and if he should still seek shelter in the barren waste and inhospitable everglades, the production of the soil of the interior would furnish an abundant supply for the Army at convenient points, while operating against him. For the purpose of carrying this plan into execution, I would respectfully suggest the expediency of locating Military colonies, under the Superintendence of the Comm" General, on all the public lands of the Peninsula, where the body is sufficiently large to support a population capable of defending itself against the inroads of the Enemy, each colony or Settlement in the first instance should be located in a healthy position, and in villages. The houses to be constructed in such a manner as to give and receive mutual defence and protection to each other. The men should be required to perform Military duty, within certain limits, and for the first year, or so long as their safety may demand it, they should be required to cultivate in common, and a portion of them, to be constantly prepared for defence. During the first Year of the Colonists who should join the Colony, and enroll themselves with the Comm"Officer, on or before a day certain, and continue to perform his duty faithfully, should be entitled to receive Pay and rations as a Soldier in the army—They should be subject in every respect to the rules and Articles of War, and be liable to be tried by a court Martial, for insubordination, or other offences. And after two years habitation, and cultivation, or the final emigration of the lndians, On the Certificate of the Comm” General, or other Officer placed over them, specifying that they have faithfully performed all the duties required of them by law, they shall be entitled to a grant in fee simple of One Quarter section of arable land to include as near as possible the improvements made by the Colony, the right of each individual to be decided by lot. A further encouragement to emigration and settlement, might be given by a prospective pre-emption law, conferring a right to purchase at the Government price one Quarter section of the public land, in all able bodied white males who would actually settle on or before a given day, and continue to inhabit and cultivate the said tract of land until the final emigration of the Seminole Indians. Each settler under this law should be exempt from any other than the ordinary law of the Country. But he should be required to produce the Certificate of the Comm" Officer of the district to prove the commencement and continuance of his settlement and improvement. Under this encouragement to emigration, I feel the utmost confidence, that in less than two Years, there would not be a resting place for the Indians north of the everglades, and that when confined to that unwholesome and comfortless region, if they are not exhausted, by disease or famine, they will be contented to emigrate from a country, which can afford them no enjoyment. I entertain no doubt but that the adoption of this measure would be attended with entire success. That it would save thousands of valuable lives, and millions of public Treasure—While the Colonies are farming, and until they are enabled to defend themselves, I would employ a sufficient Military force, to escort the settlers in safety to their new homes, to guard the settlements, and drive the enemy into the Everglades. And instead of exhausting the Treasure of the Government, and destroying the Army by fruitless and unavailing marches, in the vain effort to overtake and destroy them, when pursuit is hopeless, I would endeavour to keep them in that inhospitable region, as long as they might prefer it, to the Country assigned them in the West. By occupying healthy positions in the adjacent country, with Military Posts, and cutting off all communications with travellers, who have, and may continue to supply their wants, they would be compelled from necessity to emigrate. From no data in my possession am I able to form a correct estimate of the number of Indians yet remaining in the Country, But I have believed their force as well as their character, has been and is still calculated to low. I have given you hastily my views of the best mode of expelling them, but I shall be happy, to afford you every assistance in my power to prosecute any plan which may be adopted to relieve the Country from their presence.

<docbody>SIR On the 30" Ultimo, I attended, agreeably to appointment, at Walkers Town for the purpose of meeting all his people, and taking a correct census (from my own personal observation) of their number, ages &amp;c.;—of appraising &amp; receiving such personal property as they were prepared to turn over to me, and of ascertaining the quantity of land cleared by them, the probable cost of clearing the same;—the value of the improvements thereon &amp;c. &amp;c. Though they had a fortnight's notice, and I reminded them the day previous, that the next was the day appointed, they failed to assemble as they had promised. I went over nearly all their land and did not see more than half a dozen warriors, the rest were scattered about at the different drinking establishments, in no state to attend to business. I find here difficulties as great, if not greater than those which I experienced in ascertaining the precise boundry of Econ-chatta-mico's lands. There are two men who claim, by pre emption, half a section of the same land claimed by the Indians These men have cleared a part of the land and continue to cultivate the same. The land sold by Yellowhare, consisting of one half of the lower reserve, (Walker's,) has not yet been laid off. Under these circumstances I have concluded to employ a competent surveyor to run the dividing line between the Indian reserves and the lands by which they are bounded I will give the purchaser of Yellowhare's lands, notice, and will require him to pay the expense of defining his own bounderies. The 31" Ultimo was the day appointed to meet Econ-chatta-mico's people. I accordingly attended, but here also I was disapointed. But about the same number of warriors, made their appearence that I meet at Walkers Town. The chiefs offered to assemble their people in an hour, but I refused to wait, in as much as I had become well convinced that it would be impolitic to pay their annuity when—they at present. I therefore told them that they should receive their annuity when they were ready to start for Arkansas. They are in no want of money now having themselves disposed of nearly all their stock at private sale, notwithstanding my exertions to get possession of it. The facility with which the Indians procure liquor, renders it very difficult to do any thing with them. The laws are strict upon the subject, but it is very difficult to find sufficient evidence to convict the offenders. I have offered a reward of five dollars, to any one who will prosicute to conviction, any person or persons who presists in selling whiskey to Indians contrary to law. This I believe to be the only way in which a stop can be put to it. Things appear now more favorable than they ever have done, to the emigration of the Apalachicolas. I have but little doubt of being able to keep them together till the first of October.

<docbody>SIR, I have this day received from the Attorney of the U. States for the Middle District of Florida the inclosed letter and documents addressed to you relative to the illegal importation into the United States of certain Negroes in the Schooner Emperor; * and I have the honor to add copies of the Reports of the District Attorney to this Office relative to an information instituted by him against the Vessel, and another against the Negroes. It will be perceived that the former is still pending, and that the latter having been found to be true, the negroes are in the custody of the Marshal of the District, subject to the orders of the President of the U. States according to the provisions of the act of 3" March 1819. In the report from the District Attorney are embraced nine indictments against Charles G. Cox, and one against Joseph Croskey for the illegal importation and holding of these Negroes. As these cases (being criminal proceedings) do not fall within the superintendance of this Office, I have deemed it proper to inclose you a copy of the report of the District Attorney in relation to them, that if any further instructions are considered necessary they may be given. Very respectfully, Yours, H. D. GILPIN Solicitor of the Treasury To/THE HON” JoHN FoRSYTH Secretary of State. [Endorsed] Rec" 8* Sept. Chf. Clk. Mr Dickins </docbody>

<docbody>SIR. I herewith enclose you a copy of the record for your office, and another to be filed in the office of the Clerk of the Supreme Court, in the case of Elizabeth Wiggins vs: The United States, on a claim for 300 acres of land, which was decided pro forma by agreement, against the United States. The claimant in this case rests her claim entirely upon a document purporting to be a certified copy, made by Tomas de Aguilar Secretary of the Government of the Province of East Florida while it was under the Spanish Government, of a concession of that government for the land in question; it does not appear that this copy was ever in the archives—which have been searched and no original can be found there—nor has the claimant been able to adduce any proof, that such an original ever existed. There is a large class of these cases, embracing more than half a million of acres—and the object in this arrangement, is, to get the opinion of the Supreme Court upon the isolated question of the validity of these certificates. I am preparing for you an abstract of the argument in this and the other cases decided at our last July Term [which, by the by, is not yet ended]" and a statement of each of said cases for the Attorney General, which will be forwarded in due time. and am Sir, with great respect Your obt: Servi: THO DOUGLAS H.

<docbody>SIR, By the 1st section of the act of Congress entitled “An Act making further provision for the sale and disposition of the public grounds in the cities of St Augustine and Pensacola and to reserve certain lots and buildings for public purposes, and to provide for their repair and preservation,” approved June 28*1832, (L.L. page with suitable designations showing those which have been granted for corporate purposes by the laws of Spain or Congress, those which are the property of the United States, and those which have been confirmed to individuals; as further required by the Secretary's order the plats and field notes of the survey of St Augustine returned by the Surveyor General were submitted to him with the Commissioner's letter of the 30" of May 1836.” and in his communication of the 3rd of the succeeding month returning the plats to be filed in this office,” it was directed in reference to the sale of the lots that the office should abide the directions of the President since which there does not appear to have been any further action, so far as known to this office. Inasmuch as a considerable time has elapsed since the passage of the law and great anxiety seems to prevail on the part of the citizens of St. Augustine to have the vacant lots brought into market, I would respectfully again invite the attention of the Department to the Subject and take the liberty of recommending that the immediate action of the Secretaries of War * and of the Navy may be procured, as to the lots or portions of lots which they would recommend to be reserved under the act for Military and Naval purposes, and immediately after the President shall have sanctioned and approved such reservations, the balance of the lots might be subdivided to suit purchasers, and be offerred for sale as directed by the second section of the Act. For this purpose I herewith enclose a tracing of the general map of the City taken from that returned by the Surveyor General, upon which as will be seen have been disignated in blue ink all the public lots, as laid down on the separate maps of the blocks or squares on an enlarged scale, returned at the same time by the Surveyor General, likewise extracts are given from the field notes of survey descriptive of the manner in which the lots were occupied at the date of the survey, all which together with such other information as may be on file in the War and Navy Departments will it is hoped be sufficient to enable the President to direct which of the public lots or what portions of them shall be reserved under the Act. As regards the City of Pensacola, no returns having yet been received from the Surveyor General his attention was called to the subject on the 12th instant * with a request that he would report to this office. I am, sir, very respectfully Your obedient Servant JN° M. MOORE Acting Commissioner To M*CLINTOCK YOUNG Esq. Acting Secretary of the Treasury. [Endorsed] C. 129.

<docbody>HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA Tallahassee SIR, By to-day's mail I have caused to be forwarded to you a copy of the last report made to Congress on the condition of the Banks. If you have any statements in relation to the condition of the Banks of Florida of a later date than those contained in this document, or if you obtain any such between this time and the close of the approaching session of Congress, I will be obliged to you if you will cause them to be forwarded to me without delay. I regret that the currency of Florida is, according to the latest quotations in the New-York and Philadelphia Price Currents, in a worse condition than that of any other part of the Union. Considering the immense amount of money disbursed in that quarter, I had expected that, by this time, the notes of your Banks would have been on a level with those of Georgia. I sincerely hope that due efforts will be made by your Banks to amend an evil so injurious to the financial operations of this Department, as well as to the best interests of the Territory.” I am &amp;c LEVI WOODBURY Secretary of the Treasury JOHN J.  </docbody>

<docbody>PUBLIC MEETING A meeting of the citizens of Tallahassee is requested at 11 o'clock this day at Brown's Hotel, to take into consideration the subject of the proposed change in the Mail route between this city and Augusta, Geo. The mail has formerly been carried in four horse coaches, which in fact are oftentimes found insufficient for the accommodation of travellers going north and south. The advertisement of the Post Master General proposes to change from four to two horse coaches which at many seasons will almost prevent the possibility of our citizens going north by this route. As it is likewise proposed to consider bids for four horse coaches, it is believed that a public expression of the wishes of our citizens would have considerable weight in determining the choice of the Department.” 2: NA (WD, CE, TB Reg. of Lets.

<docbody>JAMES WHITCOMB Esq Commissioner of Gen' Land Office. SIR. The enclosed copy of a caveat against the Sale of a portion of the lands embraced in the Proclamation of the 14" of July; * has been lodged with us, by M. Benj” Putnam, Attorney for the Proprietors of the Arredondo Grant. As the Lands to which it refers, have been much enquired after, &amp; comprise some of the finest to be offered; we have thought it right to forward this Notice to the Department, and to await its instructions on the Subject, which we hope to receive before the close of the Sale. There is no Spanish Survey of this Grant, on file—and the lines were run by the United States Surveyors, in Strict accordance we believe, with the designation of the Tract, as given in the Decree of the Supreme Court, by which the Grant was confirmed. The Term “Alleged”, applied in the Proclamation to the unconfirmed or outstanding claims, which may be filed with us by private Individuals; being, not so precise or techinical, as to afford us a perfectly clear indication of the course we are to pursue in the case of unreasonable interuption of the sales, by the alledgement of false, or unsupported claims; we have deemed it safest to refer to the Department, where we feel any doubt, as to the propriety of Complying with, or disregarding claims of this spurious or unfounded character. We also avail ourselves of this opportunity to state, that we apprehend much further interuption of the sales; from the difficulties we have encountered, in attempting to designate, or mark out, the Sections which may interfere with confirmed private claims; as many of these (partly from the present disturbed State of the country) are either unsurveyed, or unlocated; while not a few of those laid down on the maps, will also form a source of confusion, from the practice pursued by the United States Surveyors, of disregarding the Spanish Line, in running out these claims, &amp; merely Surveying to the Proprietors, the amount of Land called for in their Grant, We have the honor to be, Sir, Very Respectfully, Your Obt Servts W H SIMMONS Register JOHN C.

<docbody>We the Inhabitants of the mouth of the River St. Johns, wish to show to you the necessity of having a Custom House at the mouth of said river. The present one is situated 35 miles from the bar, up a difficult river to navigate, and cannot be navigated without a pilot—When we ship our produce here, we are obliged to send it first to Jacksonville to have it cleared. And when goods are brought to us, they are also carried first to Jacksonville to be entered in the Custom House And then transported back here, which necessarily causes great inconvenience to a large portion of the Inhabitants of East Florida. Wessels, also, which are only bound to the mouth of the River, and have no business farther up are compelled to take a pilot to go up to Jacksonville which is attended with a very great expense, and frequently causes a great delay. Vessels also frequently coming in here from Foreign ports, have an opportunity to dispose of any part of their cargo they please, there being no Custom House Officer here to prevent any thing of the kind. The Custom House officers from Jacksonville never come down to the bar, on any business that concerns the Custom House, And we are well aware that there is no place in the United States where there is so great an opportunity for smuggling as at this place, in consequence of the Custom House being so far from the bar, And therefore we hope that you will make a speedy change as there is a great necessity for it—If you should do so we recommend to you Timothy Wightman as a suitable person. who, lives at the bar.

Hunter, a Captain in the U.S. Revenue Service, relating to a reference to him made in certain peti- tions for establishing a Port of Entry at Indian Key on the coast of Florida; transmitted for the consideration of the Hon. Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives by William A. Whitehead.— BALTIMORE Dec 23d 1838 MY DEAR SIR—On my arrival here from Washington I found your letter dated Dec 17" relative to the circular from the friends of Indian Key in which reference is made to me as substantiating the truth of the following passage “The harbour of Indian Key is at least equal to any other in Tropical Florida in the important points of facility of ingress &amp; egress, of depth of water, and of goodness and security of anchorage as vessels of the largest class may be brought in with perfect ease &amp;c &amp;c”— I do not recollect to have ever given such description of the harbor of Indian Key. I could not with truth have compared the harbor with that of Key West or Tortugas in point of safety.—I believe I recommended Indian Key at one time as a Port of Entry so that vessels wrecked to the Northward of or near Indian Key might enter there without being obliged to go to such a distance as Key West.— I was told at Indian Key by D* Waterhouse &amp; others that vessels that had been got off by wreckers were totally lost in their voyage from Indian Key to Key West, losing a great amount of property. For the truth of this assertion I cannot of course vouch. I do not remember the depth of water in the harbor of Indian Key.— The Cutter Jackson lay about 2 miles from the Island in about 14 feet Water.

<docbody>SIR: Your communication of the 28* Inst” on the subject of an armed occupation and Settlement of that part of Florida now overrun by the Indians I have had the honor to receive. In reply to your several interrogatories, “How far it is possible to find land fit for cultivation for these Settlers, especially towards the extremity of the Peninsula? whether healthy positions can be had for stations? And what are the facilities of raising grain and vegetables and of getting fish and game for the support of the settlers?” I beg leave to present to you the following statement as the result of my knowledge and experience in relation to the matters submitted to my consideration. There is an extensive range of Country and of very good land betwen the cove of the Withlacoochee and Silver Spring Branch at the head of Navigation on the Ochilawaha; and there are many good tracts betwen those two Rivers, extending to the Indian Settlement called Pilaklikaha, where there is another body of good land. This section of Country is capapable of supporting several thousand inhabitants; there is a plenty of game in it, and the Rivers and Lakes in the Vicinity afford fish in abundance; and withall it has the advantage of Water communication by the Withlacoochee with the Gulf of Mexico, and thro' the Ockliwaha and the S" Johns River with the Atlantic. In addition to these considerations, there are several healthy points in the Country, particularly in the vicinity of Fort King; and here a large settlement should be made, as it will be the Barrier betwen the Indians and the white settlements, and constitute the base of operations. There are some good lands on Talakchopto, both near the head of the River where it is called Pease Creek, and on the lower banks near the head of Charlottes Harbour. There are three or four good tracts on or near the banks of the Coloosa-Hatchee, particularly in the vicinity of Fort Thompson at the great crossing of the River. Fish and game abounds I believe in this Region. I am not so satisfied as to the healthfulness of this Section of the Country; but it should be occupied at all riskes, as it is on the line of the nearest practicable route betwen the Gulf and the Atlantic side of the Peninsula. A few good tracts can be gotten on the shores and on the Islands within Marcus Sound near Cape Roman. There is a beautiful tract of land of land on Pavilion River ten or twelve leagues South East of Cape Roman; and some parcels of good land may be found on the Banks of Shark River and on the shores of Lake Manitee ten leagues still farther East. At Cape Sable there is a beautiful spot for a Military Post and Depot for a Colony, which should be established on a Prairie running East and by North from that Cape along the coast towards Cape Florida. This Prairie runs immediately on the Sea Shore for thirty five miles, then turns a little North and to the interior of the Country, extending perhaps twenty or thirty miles more in length. It appears to be an inclined plain falling imperceptibly from the Sea Shore to the Everglades, a distance of fifteen or twenty miles to the interior of the Country, From what I saw of the products of the land on the Cape and the Islands in the vicinity I am induced to believe that the soil of this Prairie will produce in great perfection grain and vegetables of every kind, with Sugar Cane Cotton &amp;" &amp;” Through the Prairie there are numerous clumps and groves of trees which will afford both fuel and building timber for the Settlers. The Keys and sand Bars in front of the Cape make an excellent Harbour for Steam Boats and Sail Vessels drawing from six to ten feet water. The waters along this Coast are full of Turtle and fish of every kind, and the Prairie and woods around abound in game. The immediate site of Cape Sable is evidently healthy, as are almost all situations directly on the Sea Board; and I have no doubt that healthy positions can be gotten on the Prairie, as the climate is delightful even in the Summer Season from the prevalence of the Sea breeze, or trade winds. There are also good tracts of land on new River, and a great body of it on Indian River, both on the Atlantic side of the Peninsula; and near this last River, on S" Lucies Sound, another settlement should be made. This section of Country being within the influence of the sea atmosphere should be healthy; fish abound in the Rivers and Sounds about, and game perhaps is plenty in the Country. The Settlement on the Gulf side at Cape Sable, and on the Atlantic side near Indian River, with the present Military Post at Tampa Bay, a small Post at Punta Rassa, a Block House at or near Cape Florida, and another at Jupiter Inlet, with the occasional assistance of a Revenue Cutter, will command the whole coast, and cut off the intercourse between the Indians and the Spanish Fishermen, and Boatmen from the British Isles; while tho two Settlements more in the interior of the Country, with a Military establishment somewhere on the middle ground between the Coloosa-Hatchee and Indian River Settlements, will be in position to control the Indians. I have like yourself arrived at the conclusion, that the War with the Seminole Indians can be terminated in a shorter time, and at less cost, by an Armed occupation of the Country, than by the continuance of a regular mode of warfare. Our armies have been for years engaged in hunting up, pursuing, and killing a few Indians in each Campaign; and judging from the success we have already had, it will take five or ten years longer to kill off those that still remain, and seem determined to remain in the Country. The establishment of Military Colonies on the other hand will change the System of Warfare. Instead of the white men fighting the Indians in their Natural Fortresses, the Indians will have to come out and attack the whites within their lines of defence, and where the skill and intelligence of the Civilized man can have its influence. We shall act on the defensive, and experience teaches us that we are better at repelling an invasion, than in making a Conquest. The Indians will certainly attack our Settlements; and in each conflict, and in each succeeding Year, will lose more men than have fallen before our heavy Colums marching thro the Country. This is the way that the Western Country was won from the Savages of that Region. The Pioneers to the West pitched their camps and built their Block Houses thro the Country, and there fought a little, and worked a little, until the Indians finding that they could not dislodge the white men, pulled up stakes themselves and retired beyon the Mississippi. And so will the Seminole Indians act, for they cannot abide in the same Country with the white man. As soon as they find that the white men have set themselves down near their favorite haunts, and are determined to hold on to the Country, thro Summer and thro Winter and forever, they will, after repeated unsuccessful efforts to destroy or drive off the Settlers, in submission to their destiny surrender to the white man, and ask to be removed to the West. The proposed system of operations will have the advantage too of settling the Country while the war progresses; and by the time that the Indians have retired from the Country, it will be under cultivation an in a state to admit at once of a great influx of population; whereas under the present order of things, the immediate Theatre of action will be rendered still more desolate as the War continues; and the adjacent districts being also drained of their resources, the Country will not be in a condition to receive a Body of Emigrants for twelve or eighteen months after the Indians have been cut off, or have been removed to their new country beyond the Mississippi.” I have the honor to be, Very respectfully, Your obed Serv" TH: LAWSON Surg: Genl THE HON” THOs H BENTON US Senator Washington [Endorsed] 25" Cong 3"Sess S 160.(42) Document relating to the bill “to provide for the armed occupation and settlement of that part of Florida which is now overrun and infested by marauding bands of hostile Indians.” 1839.

<docbody>To the Senate, and House of Representatives of the United States. The undersigned, Citizens of Apalachicola, in the Territory of Florida most respectfully represent, that, the Sum of Thirty five Thousand Dollars has been expended by individual enterprise in excavating and opening a Straight Channel in the Bay of Apalachicola from the Ship Anchorage to the Wharves a distance of nearly two miles:" that, Ten Thousand Dollars has been appropriated by Congress for the same work,” which is found insufficient for its completion. It is estimated that Twenty Thousand Dollars additional will com- plete the work and admit Ships, drawing fourteen feet water to the wharves. The undersigned therefore earnestly request, that your Honorable Bodies will grant the further sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars—This is by far the largest Commercial Town in Florida, and as yet only small appropriations have been made by Congress for improving its harbour. But small appropriations are requisite to make the port the safest and most easy of access in Gulf of Mexico APALACHICOLA December 1838. Wm H Harper E F Hamilton David G. Raney J.

<place-time><month>January</month><year>1839</year></place-time>
<docbody>We understand the contemplated arrangements of Messrs. Stockton &amp; Co., for the improvement of the Northern and Western Mail routs have been nearly completed, and that the Stage line is now in full operation from Mobile to Augusta, Georgia, via Florida. From Mobile to Pensacola, the steamer Champion having undergone a thorough repair, with new copper and copper boilers is now running. There is also a tri-weekly stage running between Mobile and Pensacola, carrying the mail. From Pensacola to Lagrange, a steamboat is in fine order with handsome accommodations and first rate officers and crew. From Lagrange to Macon, there is a line of four horse coaches,—the horses are as fine as on any stage road—the coaches for the most part new or nearly new, which we are however informed, * House Journal, 25 Cong., 3 sess., p. 465. will be replaced early in the spring by others now building in Troy. The rout from this city to Augusta, has been altered to go by Macon, which is considered a great improvement, as the Florida line has the advantage of the Georgia Rail Road, thus avoiding the ferriage of two rivers, and the heavy sands near Augusta. The speed is much increased. A passenger leaving Mobile arrives at Augusta twenty-four hours in advance of the great mail. A passenger leaving Tallahassee in the morning sleeps next night but one in Macon. Going westward leaves Tallahassee in the morning and arrives at Pensacola the next morning but one. The fare is likewise reduced. From Tallahassee to Augusta, $33.50 instead of $38.50; and from Tallahassee to Pensacola $28. instead of $34. Hitherto a passenger leaving Tallahassee for the west at 2 o'clock, A.M. was compelled to go around by Bainbridge, and thence to Marianna being a distance of 95 miles—now the distance to Marianna is only 70. The Steam Boat is in fine order—the crossing of the Choctawhatchie will be made in a covered barge, protecting the passengers from sun and rain; and all the ferries are made in the day time. There are also four horse coaches on the road instead of two horse hacks that caused so much discontent. Going North the fare is reduced and the time quickened. For the present a tri-weekly line will run from Tallahassee to Quincy and will connect there with the mail line both west and north—and soon as arrangements are complete, there will be a mail five times a week from Quincy, to this place. The main line going westward passes through Quincy, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays about 12 o'clock M. Going north, Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays about ten A.M. At Macon the connection is guarantied:—if the stages of the Florida line bring one more passenger than can go on in the Mail and Telegraph line, an extra will carry him through to the Rail Road. From Chattahoochee, through which place the main line passes, the Apalachicola and St. Joseph mails are taken by Steamboat to their destination." </docbody>

Under the terms of the Presidents Proclamation all private claims that have been regularly filed for adjudication with any of the Boards of Commissioners whether Confirmed or unconfirmed must be excepted from sale. It is your duty to Satisfy yourselves, as far as practicable of the precise locations of such, and accordingly to exclude those lands covered thereby from sale.

<place-time><location>LOCUST GROVE, near Louisville Ky.</location><month>January</month><date>19</date><year>1839</year></place-time>
<docbody>DEAR SIR I have received your letter of the 5", instant" with a copy of the bill to provide for the armed occupation and settle- ment of Florida." If the plan which you propose can be carried out, the Indians may be gradually destroyed or forced to submit; and I know of no other measure likely to rid the country of them, unless by following the example of the British Government in their war with the Maroons in Jamaica, we employ the Blood Hound. The only doubt I entertain as to the complete success of the plan arises from the apprehension that the quantity of good land south of the 28° of north latitude is not sufficient to induce settlers to occupy it; north of that degree, the country is generally equal to the Southern Counties of Georgia and Alabama; but south of it, the good land is confined to a few detached spots along the coast on both sides of the Peninsula; and fresh water can rarely be obtained on the Gulf coast south of Charlotts Harbour even where the land is fit for cultivation. Between the mouth of the Wethlocco-chee and Tampa Bay there is a considerable body of excellent land: there is also good land near Tohop Koliga, and between the Ocklawaha and S" John rivers. I have no doubt healthy situations for stations or resedences might be found: and as to the Country North of the Wethlocco-chee it is quite as healthy as the greater portion of the Western and South western states; and the whole sea board is as healthy as any part of Our Atlantic Sea board south of the Delaware I would advise that the planters and farmers be urged to return to the plantations and farms which they have abandoned and that the whole country north of Tampa Bay be settled as soon as possible. The Coasts of Florida afford as valuable fisheries in proportion to their extent as the Banks of Newfoundland; and though the Country south of Tampa Bay affords but little inducemnt to the Cultivator a population sufficient to confine the Indians to the interior might find near the coast abundant support by combining fishing with Cultivation, a supply of fresh water could be obtained from the adjacent Islands. The posts to be occupied by the troops must depend, necessarily upon the number and position of the Settlements. There should always be a sufficient force in the neighbourhood of each settlement to serve as a rallying point to the settlers and to unite with them either for purposes of protection or pursuit. There is a small body of good land on New river, also on the Miami river near Cape Florida, which was occupied previous to the war—two or three hundred inhabitants might support themselves comfortably on that portion of the territory: no part of the United States is more healthy: A Light House is necessary in that neighbourhood; and so valuable is the commerce that passes that part of the coast, and so numerous the wrecks in consequence of the difficulty of the navigation, that, to protect the crews and property cast on shore, the country should be settled and military posts sheuld be established on New river, and near cape Florida. There is a body of excellent land near Cape Sable the most southerly point of the Peninsula, which would support several hundred inhabitants—this it would be highly advantageous to occupy as soon as possible. A military post should be established and maintained at the Cape. Posts will be necessary at Indian River Inlet, at the head of Indian river, at New Smyrna, and at one or two other points between the latter Post and S*Augustine. A Post should be established at Punta Rosa South of Tampa, and at one or two points between Tampa and the mouth of the Suwannee those points of course to be determined by the settlements that may be made on or near the coast. The Posts across the Country from the Gulf to the Atlantic should not be considered permanent, but be changed as the Settlements in the interior be advanced to the South. I have read the letter of Surgeon General Lawson and agree with him generally in his views. As to the war which we have carried on in Florida it differs not only from any ever before waged by this Country, but from any other of which we have an account in history, unless the Maroon war in Jamaica be an exception. The object has been, and is now, not to beat and compel the enemy to make peace, but to catch them. No force employed against them, either in the former or present war Seminole war, no matter by whom commanded, has ever been able to catch them; and my decided opinion is if they ever be caught it must be with their own consent: and that consent will hardly be given until they find the white man in their way. Let them be crowded by settlers, and that which has invariably occured throughout the whole history of our settlements will occur again—they will not only consent to remove, but will desire it as the greatest benefit the nation can confer upon them.” With high consideration and respect Your Ob" Serv" THO. JESUP THE HON. THO. H. BENTON, Chairman of the Military Committee of the Senate, Washington City. </docbody>

<docbody>To the Honorable Congress of the United States— We whose names are undersigned, Citizens of the Western District of Florida, would respectfully represent to your Honorable body that whereas Government is instituted to promote the happiness of the people, in the accomplishment of which object it is necessary that wrongs should be redressed &amp; rights enforced—and whereas it is the bounden duty of all good Government to develope the resources of the country under its controul, particularly where those resources may be of general benefit to the people—We therefore, a portion of your constituents, who have at all times &amp; under all circumstances faithfully fullfilled all our duties which have devolved upon us as good &amp; faithfull Citizens, respectfully present to your Honorable body the following statement of facts which we earnestly urge you to take into serious consideration—Yellow River, a tributary stream of Blackwater Bay, rises in the state of Alabama &amp; pursuing a southerly course through West Florida, discharges its waters into Blackwater Bay, an arm of &amp; conjoining the Bay of Escambia, about twenty miles east of the City of Pensacola—About twenty miles of this River in Walton County, Florida, is skirted on either side by a body of rich &amp; valuable land, which is now settled by about forty families &amp; is capable of supporting a much larger population—Many streams valuable for affording mill-seats &amp; the large quantities of excellent timber of various kinds which skirt their borders, are tributary to this River; but the navigation which is naturally good for plying steamboats &amp; other craft of the same draft of water, is at this time so obstructed for about fifty miles by huge piles of drift wood which have become so matted together as to form rafts of considerable extent in different parts of the River, that its navigation unless cleared out is altogether impracticable—Were these rafts however, removed, this River would be navigable for all boats necessary to be used here, from the settlements on its borders to Pensacola—&amp; the lands &amp; fine timber skirting its margins &amp; its tributary streams would be greatly enhanced in value—The people in this section of the country are now compelled, in the absence of water communication, to transport their produce over land for forty miles before they reach navigable water which may float their produce to the nearest market and if they continue on by land, the distance is lengthened to sixty miles &amp; an expense of crossing two ferries, one of which is four miles in extent, is incurred—all these inconveniences &amp; disadvantages may be remedied by the removal of the rafts of wood in Yellow River, which we are assured may be accomplished by the expenditure of about six thousand Dollars— The right of petitioning for a redress of grievances is guarantied to us by the constitution under which we live, and the relative duty of hearing &amp; carefully considering our petitions must devolve upon your Honorable body—And it is with confidence that we appeal to your Honorable body to do what may be in your power to remove the grievance under which we labour &amp; remedy the evils of which we complain—Whilst other portions of our Territory have been nurtured &amp; sustained by your fostering care &amp; protection, we have been utterly neglected &amp; have silently borne the wrongs of which we now complain; but we feel convinced that when they are made known to in a respectfull manner, by a faithfull &amp; unobtrusive people, they will be immediately redressed—We therefore humbly pray that your Honorable body will take this matter into serious consideration &amp; that you will make the necessary appropriation to remove all obstructions to the navigation of Yellow River up to the Settlements on its borders which is, by the river, about one hundred miles above its disemboguement into Blackwater Bay &amp; as in duty bound your petitioners will ever pray David A M David Henry J.

<docbody>SIR, I beg leave to call your attention to the subject of cleaning out the Suwannie river in Florida, and to ask your aid and cooperation in endeavouring to procure an appropriation for that purpose. I deem it of vital importance in a military view. Its banks on both sides, have been “debateable land”, the main scene of operations during the present war, and provisions have been and continue to be landed on Black Creek. and hawled one hundred &amp; one hundred and fifty miles to the banks, and neighborhood of the Suwannie—So important has this river been deemed by the generals in the field, that recognoisances have been frequently directed to be made, to see if it were possible to use this Stream to introduce provisions, and on Several occasions, steam boats have been forced up, at great hazard and some injury to the boats. It is believed that the oyster banks at its mouth are the only obstacles to its complete usefulness could be moved for $25000 and I have no doubt, if done before the commencement of the war, it would have saved the United States four times the amount. Indeed, as every failure to end the war, has arisen solely from the failure of provisions it is more than probable, if the river in Florida, running into the heart of the hostile country had been rendered available at an early period, such as the Withlacoochie and the Suwannie, it is more than probable this war would have long ago been ended. It is proper to add, that if the Bill now proposed in the Senate by Mr Benton should become a law,” the settlers on the Gulf side, could not obtain the provisions necessary to support them, through any other channel, without, great expense and hazard of life, and if left to depend, for supplies, on what could be transported in wagons from Black Creek, much danger would be incurred through the Summer, of Starvation—or an army must be constantly employed, on the march through the sickly season to escort and guard the baggage train. For the considerations Sir, I have appealed to Congress for an appropriation to clean out the river for a light house and a custom house at its mouth—the light house will be necessary—the Custom house useful and independant of the receipt of customs will form a nucleus around which population will gather, and thus push the Seminoles one step farther from the settled frontier. I must respectfully request you sir to furnish me any information your dept. may possess upon the Capabilities of the Suwannee river, and if my views accord with yours that you would lend your excellent aid to bring about the result above detailed, and so important, in every point of view, civil and military * I am Sir respectfully C.

<docbody>To the Honorable, the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled: We, the undersigned, citizens of Florida, respectfully solicit of your Honorable body, that you will graciously view the prayer of Florida for a grant of a township of land, in aid of founding the DADE INSTITUTE OF FLORIDA; in which shall be honored the dead and educated the living. Florida being a Territory, and therefore under the particular care of Congress, the distressed and ravaged state of the country— the many respected sons of the several States, lying unhonored in her wilds—the many impoverished children, impoverished by the Indian war, that must grow up in ignorance and vice, if a fostering hand is not extended to them, emboldens us to urge this humane, useful and charitable desire upon the sympathies of a feeling nation.

<docbody>THE HON: SECRETARY OF WAR SIR. The letter from the Hon: M. Downing of Florida, of the 25th ult° * states “A railroad is in contemplation from S*Augustine to Picolata” It is the wish of this company to obtain the $17000 appropriated last year to repair the Millroad—and bridge between these places, and the application is now pending before Congress. May I beg that You will suspend all operations on that road, until the fate of this application be known. As the terms offered by the Company are highly favourable to the U.S. I have but little doubt of Success before Congress.” In reference to the same I am required to report the State of the work and the effect of the Suspension asked for. The work is under the direction of Lieutt R* M*Lane, who was written to on the 4” of Jany * in the following words: “A memorial has been presented to Congress for the transfer of the appropriation to the Stock of a Railroad Company,” but as yet no action has been had upon the same. You will please report upon the advantages &amp; disadvantages of such a plan, and whether the same would be acceptable or not to the great body of the inhabitants of that vicinity. In the meantime such operations on the road you are making, as would not suffer by the delay, or occasion damages to the contractors, could be suspended.” But before he could receive this letter, having duly advertised for proposals, he had entered into contract, as will appear by an extract of a letter, dated 14* Jany 1830.* N° 1. and copies of the contracts therein inclosed are herewith submitted, marked N* 2 &amp; 3. The letter from this Bureau, of the 4” of Jany, was not received by Lt" M*Lane till some days after his Contracts were made. The acknowledgement bears date the 23" of Jany,” a copy of which, N° 4, is herewith inclosed; also copies of the memorials referred to, N° 5 &amp; 6, Lt"M"Lane's action in the matter appears in my judgment, to have been correct, nor do I see how the work can now be suspended without involving the U.S. in damages to the contractors.” Very respectfy Signed: J.

<docbody>MY DEAR SIR, As I neither desire or would accept of office, and under the impression that my object will be better accomplished by addressing you in-perseh directly, I have determined to do so in my wonted frank manner. In truth the success of the principles you have made the basis of your administration, mainly depend on a united &amp; vigourous action of all the friends of these principles. During my sojourn in Florida I have not been an indifferent spectator to passing events, and while the inhabitants have had much cause to deplore the ravages of the Indians, owing in part to collisions between the Federal &amp; Territorial powers, I have depricated still more the insiduous encroachments of a Paper aristocracy. The Banks in this Territory owing to injudicious legislation have the most alarming powers conferr" on them. In addition to which, by the influence they exert over the Territorial officers—more especially the Executive, they overleap with impunity the few barriers erected by an inexperienced &amp; incautious Legislature. The result of all this is that we are mustering and arming a number of Corporation Principalities which are already arrayed against your lending measures, and soon may become irrisistible. This is not the most alarming view of this subject. The citisens who have no direct interest in the Banks may in the end be burthen” with a debt of one or more hundred million of dollars, to redeem the faith of the Territory &amp; the indirectly plighted faith of Congress. Much of the evil might be prevented provided the Governor who has the appointment of a portion of the Directors would place able &amp; disinterested men in the directory. But he seems to be content to retain, or put in such persons as are most acceptable to the leading influences in Bank. As proof of this he has appointed in the Union Bank, the brother of the President and also the brother of the cashier I have felt it to be my duty to lay these facts before you under a confident belief that your wisdom will devise &amp; apply a proper remidy With the highest respect I have the honor to be Your Ob"S" JN° BRANCH To HON M W BUREN Washington Cy, [Endorsed] Jn" Branch JOHN J.  </docbody>

<docbody>THE HONBLE SECRETY OF WAR SIR, The letter from the Hon. M. Downing of the 25" Jany,” upon which I have been required to report, relates to the clearing out of the Suwanee river in Florida, and asks the aid &amp; cooperation of the War Department in endeavours to procure an appropriation for that purpose, M" Downing States: “it is believed that the oysterbank at its mouth, the only obstacle to its complete usefulness, could be removed for $25,000.” In the report of the Board of Engineers, of the 28 Febry 1829,” upon the project of a canal to connect the Gulph of Mexico with the atlantic Ocean, very favourable notice is taken of this river, &amp; the Board remarks “that the Suwanee having from the upper fork to the Sea but one tributary, and its banks being thinly timbered, rather low and not much liable to be undermined, is generally free from driftwood, circumstances which, added to a good depth of water, render the river well adapted to Steamboat navigation.” The U. S. Survey of this river, extends to its junction with the gulph. At this junction, says the Board, in the report before alluded to, the river exhibits the appearance of a marshy delta, through which numerous outlets run to the sea. The depth and course of the latter experience frequent &amp; sudden changes, by storms from the Sea &amp; floods from the Stream. The entrance of these outlets is moreover obstructed by an extensive oysterbank projecting at least one mile out from the Shore, furrowed by many narrow channels of various depths. The main one runs near the western extremity of the oysterbank, and opposite the western and principal outlet of the river. It affords at low tide about 4 feet of water; the tide rises from 18 to 30 inches and is chiefly governed by the winds. The least depth found, after fairly entering the river as far up as near the mouth of the S** Fe is about 12 feet. From the map which accompanies this report it will be seen that the oysterbank forms a crescent completely covering &amp; protecting the entire delta of the river, and that the present depth of water through the western extremity of the bank is as great as the depth in the channel across the bay between the bank &amp; the mouth of the river as Bradfords-island. To deepen the passage through the oysterbank would therefore be of no use, unless the deepening were continued through the channel to the mouth of the river. The work is completely within the power of a dredging machine, but the ultimate cost of the improvement it would be difficult to state without further investigation of the locality, as, in addition to the dredging of the bank and channel, it may become necessary to obstruct all but the western outlet of the river. Under these circumstances an estimate of the probable cost cannot well be given. But for the dredging it may be stated that a suitable boat delivered at the place, will probably cost not less than . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $20,000.00 Four properly constructed discharging scows . . . . . 3,200.00 Expenses necessary to keep the same in activity for one year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,000.00 Total $38,200.00 The Survey which accompanies this report, not having been made for such an object, is not sufficiently minute to justify an estimate of the quantity of Material which will have to be removed from the Oyster bank and the channel. The estimate is therefore for one year. But as the dredging machine and the discharging scows will last for many years with repairs, future expensies for this object will be limited to the cost of repairs, and to those necessary to the active use of the machine. . But on examining the accompanying plan, it would appear that not more than four feet water can be carried over the extensive shoal outside of the oysterbank, should this be the case, the advantages of deepening the pass through the bank &amp; the channel would be very limited. The shoal outside, however, was not much examined at the time, and it is in reference to this that more minute Surveys are requisite, before it can be decided whether the dredging proposed would be a useful expenditure of money or not. Under these circumstances allow me to advise: that in the wording of the appropriation, it should state to be “expended upon such a plan as the War Department shall approve.” With such a restriction upon the appropriation, as a preliminary step a careful survey would first be made, and no other expenditure unless a plan promising of success could be based upon the data obtained by the Survey." Very respectfully &amp;c Signed: J. J. ABERT C. T. E. </docbody>

Your memorialists respectfully represent that they do not pretend to be precisely informed of all the particular objects of the applicants for said charter, but judging from the tenor of the instrument, and common report, they believe that it is the general design of the above named individuals, in the event of the act of the Legislative Council conferring the charter, being confirmed by your Honorable body to avail themselves of its privileges, and to speculate on its advantages to the entire exclusion of the rest of the community Your memorialists represent that the above charter being in the language of legislation “a close charter” they cannot admit the propriety of conferring the exclusive previleges of monopolizing its Capital with all the other advantages of a public institution like a bank, which, from its direct influence on the currency every body is more or less concerned with, upon a few persons who, bear a small proportion both in wealth, and numbers to the whole community Your memorialists, further, respectfully represent that they are anxious to be understood as not desiring to see annulled or opposed in your Honorable body the passage of a charter for a bank to be established in Apalachicola upon principles advantageous to the whole public. On the contrary being fully impressed with the belief that the banking facilities at present afforded to the community are insufficient for the exigencies of its trade, and that in consequence much of its banking business is effected through institutions of other cities having no direct sympathies or interests in its prosperity, they are extremely desirous to have a bank located among them. But during the brief existence of Apalachicola as a city they have experienced in the failure of the only banks established in it the painful evils of a “close charter”, and they have much reason to believe that neither the welfare of a future bank, nor the interests of its inhabitants would be consulted by granting a similar charter as a monopoly to a few individuals while they believe that the benefit of both would be greatly promoted by one, the stock of which should be open to the subscription of all persons alike Your memorialists, therefore, respectfully pray that no such exclusive privilege as the charter for a bank conferred by the Legislative Council of this Territory upon the before named individuals, may be granted, but that said charter may be so modified as that the right to the charter, and the subscription for its stock shall be open, under such regulations as may secure a fair distribution to all the inhabitants of Apalachicola L.

<docbody>To the President of the United States of America The Memorial of the Senate and House of Representatives of the Legislative Council of Florida respectfully represents, That your memorialists view with deep interest and concern the present condition of the frontier of this Territory, That although the United States have a numerous regular force employed in its defence and in prosecuting the war against the Seminole Indians, such as might seem to justify the presumption of security to the people, there is not a family in the border settlements for the distance of more than three hundred miles, which is not exposed to the utmost peril. Your memorialists have no disposition to complain of the neglect of the General Government, which has on all occasions shewn a just sympathy for our sufferings and afforded such defence, as might rea- sonably have been esteemed sufficient to ensure our safety, but we are constrained to say that the force employed for the past year, has entirely failed to give the protection required, and that we are yet exposted to the inroads of a subtle and ferocious enemy, and are visited with all the calamities, and experience all the horrors incident to a state of War; with ruthless savages; After the discharge of the Florida troops from services in January 1838, the inhabitants were generally requested by the Government officers to reoccupy their long abandoned homes and to proceed in cultivating their plantations; deeming the force in the Country sufficient to afford full protection; it was, however, too soon painfully illustrated that the inhabitants had been lulled into a too fatal security: early in March of last year, the numerous murders in Columbia, Alachua, Madison and Jefferson Counties scenes which continued during the whole summer amounting in several cases to the indiscriminate butchery of the whole families, without a survivor to give the horrid narrative of their untimely fate, scenes which have continued and are now almost daily taking place within a few miles of our Capitol and along the whole line of frontier from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Coast: and the mangled bodies of Fathers, Mothers and helpless infants have presented one general scene of carnage: Your memorialists will not indulge the feelings or employ the impressions which these barbarities are calculated to awake: But for a more detailed account of these disasters they beg leave most respectfully to refer you to the special message of the Governor of this Territory, and the official correspondence with which it is accompanied: those documents not only present in forcible terms the present and past sufferings and distress of the frontier inhabitants, but they illustrate with perspicuity the objections to the present system of defence, and recommend one which if adopted, would in the opinion of your memorialist, be productive of the most beneficial results: without a change of the policy now pursued, without the sanction of the General Government to the measures of the Governor of the Territory in calling out the local force in cases of emergency, your memorialists anticipate a continuance of the present disasters of the frontier, so long as a single inhabitant shall endeavour to hold his position against the enemy: Your memorialists can therefore no longer turn a deaf ear to the sufferings of their fellow citizens, nor can they longer remain silent spectators of the scenes of bloodshed which are continually exhibited on our borders. We appeal to you in behalf of the people of this Territory, they invoke your authority as commander in chief of the Army of the United States, and they respectfully ask that such a system of defence may be organized as will give security to those who are now exposed to danger: Your memorialists believe that the plan proposed by the Governor of the Territory in his letter of the 4” of October 1838, to the Secretary of War,” a copy of which accompanies his special message herewith enclosed," and to which they beg leave to invite your special attention, is best calculated to answer the end designed. A plan similar in some respects seems to have been contemplated by the Secretary of War, and from the manner in which it was introduced in his last annual report to Congress," your memorialists, and the people of this Territory had flattered themselves that it would have been promptly carried into execution. But from the answer of the commanding General to the letter of the Governor of this Territory urging the immediate adoption of this measure as the best means of defence, he appears to regard the order of the War department for that purpose as discretionary: and no preparations seems yet to have been made for carrying it into effect. If the frontier were divided into Districts, and the inhabitants capable of bearing arms, were organized into companies and regiments and mustered into service of the United States, they would in the opinion of your memorialists, constitute the best and most efficient defence of the frontier: their skill in the use of fire arms, their knowledge of the Country and of the enemy, the interest they naturally feel for the safety of their families, and their being accustomed to the climate, render them peculiary fitted to that serivce: Under proper rules of discipline and subordination, they would be efficient in the field, and would be the best guardians of their own homes.— The adoption of this mode of defence would give confidence and security and would bring hundreds of emigrants to the frontier: Without this or some other equally efficient plan, the patriotic inhabitants, who have for more than three years past maintained their ground: in spite of all the disasters and misfortunes to which they have been exposed, and seeing no hope of relief, must retire, exhausted by the ravages ef the of the enemy to some place of security, and leave the savage foe in undisturbed possession of the Country. Your memorialists beg leave also to state that on the refusal of the Comds General to receive the local force into service, applications were immediately made to the war Department by the officers of Florida, through the Delegate in Congress and in several cases by personal solicitation at the Department at Washington those applications have always been referred to the officer Comd" in Florida, whose reply has invariably been that he had a sufficient number of troops to defend the frontier and protect the inhabitants from further scenes of bloodshed and murder—how far this has been proved will be seen when your memorialists assert and declare that more persons have been murdered by the Savage enemy during the past year than had been during the whole of the preceding two years and a half! In many of the Eastern Counties after the work of death had progressed to some extent and the Comd" Gen' had been tendered the services of the local force by their officers, and refused, the officers commanding the militia in Columbia, Alachua &amp; Duval Counties were compelled (to prevent the entire abandement of the Country) to employ their commands in scouting the Country, for the purpose of giving protection to the settlers and of pursuing the scattered parties of the enemy, by which means confidence was restored and large Crops of Corn and other provisions made, which without the employment of this force would have been entirely lost to the Country as well as its entire population: the forces thus raised and employed were unable to perform more service than a defensive one from the want of proper supplies, the crop of the year 1837, had been consumed by the army and very little forage, except what was transported from a great distance, &amp; at great expense could be furnished them, add to which the United States stores, both Quarter Master and Commissaries were entirely closed against any application or requisitions of the Geverher a Territorial Officer, even therequisitions of the Governor had been entirely disregarded, whereby the Governor has had in some cases to disband Troops called out in times of great danger, and when their services were important: Had there been a scarcity of supply in the Government Stores, the case would have been materially different: but at the same time that refusals to grant small supplies, were made by the officers in charge of depots, they were filled to everflowing with provisions: large quantities of which has since been sold, at a great loss to the Government— Your memorialists further represent that the troops who were in service under the order of the Governor and other officers of the Territory during the past year, and whose services were important in preventing further scenes, of massacre on the frontier, up to this time remain unpaid, although the payment has been repeatedly urged on the Department—We trust that this will be no longer delayed, and that the payment will be promptly made, to a gallant and suffering people who have been ever ready to respond to their Country's call— Your memorialists having in this memorial taken a view of the condition of the Territory, do most earnestly appeal for redress to the President: let not this be considered as an idle complaint, formed on light and or trifling grounds— We respectfully, altho' earnestly ask that the Executive officer of this Territory, may have power to obtain from the Government Stores, such supplies as are necessary for the local force, whose services are so frequently necessary on the frontier, and that the troops so called out be mustered into service, and continued under the orders of the Executive or of such officers as he may appoint to command them: this arrangement being actually necessary, as the General commanding is frequently two hundred miles from the settlements, where those frequent outrages are committed by the enemy on the persons and property of our Citizens, and to deprive us of the supplies necessary to pursue the marauding parties of the enemy (until the Commanding General can be consulted, amounts to a total and entire denial of that protection that we have a right to expect"— And your memorialists will ever pray E L DRAKE Speaker of the House of Represent’ JOHN WARREN President of the Senate [Endorsed] Ref" to the Sect” of War MVB 1 Commanding General 50 Hon C.

<docbody>MAJOR GENERAL A. MACOMB Commdg. General U.S. Army Washington. SIR; You will proceed with as little delay as practicable to Florida, and after a full examination of the State of that territory and of the War carrying on there, you will adopt such measures as may seem to you most expedient to secure the protection of the settlers in Middle and East Florida, to prosecute the War with vigour, and to bring it to a speedy and successful termination. It is advisable that you should visit that part of the country which has so lately been the theatre of Indian depredations and murders, ascertain if possible what hostile bands were concerned in them, and take measures to prevent the recurrence of similar outrages in future. If, as it is probable, it should appear that the fugitive Creeks have committed these acts, you will take the proper steps to drive them from their fastnesses, and if practicable to induce them to come in and surrender. Whatever measures of rigour it may be necessary to adopt in order to repress the incursions of the Indians, no threats ought to be held out against them; but on the contrary, the language of all communications with them should be mild and conciliatory; the object of the government being not to punish their barbarities however enormous they may have been, but to prevent their repetition. Congress having by making an appropriation for that purpose, signified a desire that another effort should be made to treat with the Seminoles, you will use your best endeavors to open a communication with their Chiefs, and if they show any willingness to enter into a negotiation with you for their peaceful removal, you are at liberty to make a truce with them until the terms can be finally arranged, confirming them to that portion of the Peninsula south of 27° 30" latitude, until they can be finally removed according to the terms of the treaty of Payne's landing. It appears to the Department equally important to the entire pacification of the territory, to its effectual protection and early settlement, as well as to the prompt defence of the fortresses on the Gulf of Mexico, that a chain of posts to be connected by a good road should be established across the peninsula from the river St. John's, to Tampa Bay, and you are directed to cause an examination to be made of the country between those waters, in order to determine the most suitable points of departure and the best line for the formation of such a communication between the Atlantic and the Gulph; and if you find it practicable to establish it, you will proceed to do so. The location and construction of the road, the number and proximity of the posts, and all other details both for the protection of the route, the supply of the posts with men, horses and provisions are to be confided altogether to your discretion. Your attention however is called to the necessity of placing a sufficient force at each of these posts, to be composed of Infantry as well as Calvary, and of encouraging the inhabitants of Florida, who are now fed by the bounty of the government to settle near them and under their protection to cultivate the country in their immediate vicinity.— You will direct your attention to the withdrawal of such portions of the regular forces as can be spared from Florida, and supply their places by drafts from the militia of the territory not to exceed 1000 mounted men, or what would be preferable, 1500, in the proportion of 500 mounted and 1000 Infantry—With a view to the protection of the commerce of the gulph of Florida, you will establish such posts along the coast as you may judge necessary, but especially at Key Biscayne, New river Inlet and Indian river Inlet. Two vessels are now preparing to cruise steadily along that coast, and will co-operate with the forces at the posts you may establish to protect vessels navigating that sea and to prevent all communication between the Indians and the Cuba fisherman who are supposed to furnish them with supplies. In the execution of General Taylor's plan to divide a certain portion of the country into districts of 20 miles square, it will be necessary to avoid withdrawing the posts in front of the frontier plantations which are still occupied by the settlers. Every thing should be done to render those settlements perfectly secure and in whatever plan of defence you may think proper to adopt, that of these exterior plantations should be an object of primary consideration.” I have the honor to be, &amp;c.

<docbody>SIR, Congress having appropriated funds for the purchase of two vessels by this department, to be employed in protecting the Atlantic coast of Florida, I have provided the sea steamer Poinsett and schooner Wave for that purpose, and propose to turn them over to your department, to be placed under the command of officers of the Navy and to 488173–60–39 be manned and navigated by Seamen and marines. The principal objects contemplated by this measure, are to cooperate with the land forces by transporting Such troops as it may be desirable to Send from one Station to another along the coast—to cut off all communication between the Indians of Florida and the islands of Providence and Cuba, and to prevent a repetition of the outrages perpetrated by the Savages, during the last summer, upon the property and persons of those who were shipwrecked and cast upon that shore. Orders will be given to the Quarter Master at Baltimore, where the Steamer now is, to deliver that Wessel to any Officer you may think proper to designate for that command, after causing such repairs and alterations to be made in her as may be deemed necessary—Whatever number and description of barges may be required, to render the Service complete and effective, will be furnished by the Quarter Master.” Very respectfully Yr Mo ob" Serv J.

<docbody>HON: SECY: OF WAR SIR I reached this post yesterday morning, after having used all dilligence in getting hither. I was so fortunate as to find here General Taylor, the Commander of the Troops in Florida, and Col” Twiggs" of the 2" Dragoons, Commander of this District. Having conferred with these gentlemen on the State of affairs &amp; the condition of things in reference to the War and the Indians. I determined at once to send out runners to the Indians to inform them of my arrival and wish to meet them at Fort King on the 1st: of May. General Taylor sets off this morning towards the Suwanee with a view of carrying into effect his plan of covering the settlements by laying off the Country into Districts 20 miles square and establish in the centre of each, a small post. He will proceed to the west of the Suwanee to see to matters in that quarter and to afford protection to the exposed settlements between it and Tallahassee—Captain Griffin "Ass Adj* Genl: is now engaged in inspecting and mustering into service, such volunteers as Gov. Call may have been able to get to serve on the line of communication; as yet but few have offered as far as General Taylor can learn. There has been of late some depredations committed by the Indians on the defenceless inhabitants, all reports confirm the fact, that the indians have broken up into small parties, probably the better to gain a subsistence. The express between Tampa Bay and this post have however, traveled without molestation.” I have the honor to be &amp;c ALEX MACOMB Major-Genl: Com-in-Chief SECRETARY DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE </docbody>

<docbody>SIR Your letter of 28* March has been received.” I am aware of the advantages of the arrangement you propose for paying the Legislative and other Territorial expences of Florida. I take it for granted however as the duties of my office are prescribed by law and my compensation is so very inadequate, that it is not the intention of the Department to impose additional duties and responsibilities which do not appertain to my Office, without a fair remuneration by a percentage on the amount audited and disbursed. I am satisfied that I could save to the Government more than 5 p" cent on the whole amount appropriated for the pay and expences of the Legislative Council, by purchasing stationary &amp;c in New York and making my contracts here for printing &amp; other contingencies for the Council, previous to the Session. Under the present arrangement articles are furnished the Council upon the request of the Door Keepers by the Merchants without the quantity quality or price being previously ascertained, and the bills are allowed as a matter of course by the Legislative Council. As I am not in the habit of lending my name as Security I am unwilling to request any man to be my security, and if it meets with the approbation of the Department I would greatly prefer to to secure the Government by a lien upon lands and slaves to double the amount of the bond required, to be approved by the Judge or Dis' Att'. I shall wait to hear from the Department on this subject. No time however need be lost, as you can immediately inclose the authority for me to draw for the appropriations for this Territory to Gen.' Isham G Searcy, the Post Master at Tallahassee, with instructions that it shall not be delivered to me until I present him a lien on lands and slaves or bond and security if required, approved as you may direct: to be transmitted to your Department by the Post Master or Dis' Att”—The expences of living here are extravagantly high I assure you that although I live in the plainest manner my Salary as Secretary does not defray one third of my expences.

<docbody>OFFICER COMMANDING FORT KING, F* SIR Having arrived in Florida, it is my intention of holding, if possible, a conference with the chiefs of the hostile Bands of Indians and with that view have despatched runners, into the Indian Country, with an invitation to them, to meet me on the 1st of May at Fort King. I am in hopes that some of the Indians may come in, as I have sent to inform them, that if they cease hostilities, they may retire to the country on the west side of the Peninsula below Pease Creek and remain quietly there and that we shall on our part, cease hostilities. If you have any friendly or other indians, or persons, who will convey to the chiefs, my intention, you are requested to send out to them and invite them to come in at Fort King on the 1st of next month. If there be any indisposition on the part of the Chiefs to come in them- selves, they can send such persons as they may think proper to represent them. You will communicate to the Commanders of Posts in your vicinity, what is above stated and say, to them that, if any indians stop at their posts on the way, that they may allow them to pass on without molestation, and at the same time treat them Kindly and give them a small supply of provisions. You will oblige me by preparing some kind of accommodation for myself and military friends, amounting to five persons, including myself.” Hoping to see you soon I am with respectful consideration.

<docbody>CAPT CPBLL GRAHAM U. S. C. T. E. Mobile Al" SIR, During the last Session of Congress there were two appropriations for river Surveys in Florida, viz: 1 “for the removal of obstructions at the mouth of the Suwanee river, and for the Survey of Said river with a view to its improvement: $15000.” 2 “For the Survey of Yellowriver, Fla, to ascertain the practicability of removing the raft which obstructs its navigability . . . . . $500.00” " The Superintendence of these Surveys is assigned to you in addition to your other duties. The Suwanee has been already surveyed to its mouth, which will limit Your attention to the obstructions there, and the inclosed copy of that Survey will present to your immediate notice the character of those obstructions. On examining this Sketch, it appears that the deepest water from the gulph approaches nearest to the most eastern pass (N° 1) across the oyster bank, but the pass is both, shallow &amp; narrow, and the extent of shoal water in the bay of considerable length, from the pass to the river. The Second pass (N° 2) through this bank, proceeding—westwardly, is liable to the same objections. The third also, (N° 3) but in this the six foot depth, outside &amp; inside the bank approaches the nearest. The fourth (N° 4) is the best passage through the bank, and is the one now used in all commercial intercourse with the mouth of the river, but altho’ the best it is also difficult from the extent of shoal water of a less depth than six feet. Also, if the survey be correct, the best approach from the gulph is adjacent to the most eastern pass, and any vessel must be exposed to a long and critical detour befor it can gain the most western. From these facts it will be perceived that whichever pass should be adopted as the subject of any system of improvement, it will have to be deepened, and the more westwardly the position of this pass, the greater its distance from the best access to the open gulph. It is also apparent from the map, that if a nine foot depth should be attempted, the shortest line of operations would be at the second pass westwardly (N° 2), but for a six foot depth the shortest line would be at the third pass westwardly (N° 3). Our efforts cannot be directed to effecting a depth of entrance of less than six feet, and if one of nine could probably be made at no more than a fair proportional increase of cost so much the better. Protected as this bay is, by the oysterbank, a dredgeboat could operate most effectively within the bay and during a great time outside. But if a sufficiently wide passage were made through the bank at, either, the second or third pass, and then a proper depth dredged to the river, and the other passes through the bank filled up, by throwing the excavated material in them, the waters of the river &amp; bay would have no other outlet than through the newly excavated pass, and I should not be surprised if under such circumstances, they would of themselves be sufficient to open the channel from the bank outside to the one which now exist there. If care were taken to throw the excavated oysters in the passes filled up, they would soon grow, adhere to each other and form a permanent work. These general reflections are hazarded upon an inspection of the map now sent to you. Your first case will be to determine the accuracy of this map and to add to it those details of soundings of which it is now deficient, and without which one cannot determine upon any plan of improvement. In the execution of this Survey your attention will be directed to its object; and with the results obtained you will furnish your views, of the plan which should be pursued and of its probable cost.” The “Yellow River” is a name that you will probably not find on the map of Florida. It is understood to be the “Yellow water”, a river which empties itself into the northeastern part of Pensacola bay. Lieut Palmer will be directed to report to you.” In the execution of these duties you will, of course, exercise that discretion due to the climate &amp; the health of the party. Please to furnish an estimate of the fund required to make the Survey. Ltt Palmer will take instruments with him * Respectflly &amp; Signed: J. J. ABERT C T. E. </docbody>

Under the joint resolution of Congress on 30" April 1816,” this Department was authorized to permit payments into the Treasury, in notes of Banks which are payable and paid on demand, in the legal corrency of the United States.

<docbody>SIR Having fixed on the first day of this month for meeting the Indians at this place, I repaired hither on the 27" ultimo and made arrangements for their reception but not a single individual of them has made his appearances yet. General Taylor dispatched to Tampa Bay a brother of Tiger Tail with some other Indians with instructions to go out and find if possible Sam Jones and any other indians and invite them to come to this post, but instead of doing so, the Messengers with a number of other Indians, who had been quietly residing near Fort Brooke at Tampa, all left the place in the night stealing posed to be coming from the north have been making their way south, passing through the swamps and dense hammocks on the route and killing such persons as they could meet. In the Alachua prairie, they killed within a week three citizens, who were out in search of cattle and within 9 miles of Micanopy on the road leading to this post, a party of five attacked an equal party of mounted volunteers put them to flight and killed one man and one horse, a party of regular officers with a small escort had just passed over the road, where the volunteers were attacked, without molestation. This party was overtaken by the flying volunteers and returned with some of the men of Capt. Tyner's detachment of volunteers stationed at Fort Wheelock within a mile and a quarter of the place of attack, and recovered the body of the dead volunteer &amp; the guns and saddles of the defeated party. It is a remarkable fact that the Indians do not attack the parties of regular Troops, which are constantly traveling the country; nor do they attack, or molest the trains of wagons, which are constantly passing from Post to Post with no other guard than the drivers; and officers, in parties of two or three, are allowed to pass without notice. The opinion prevails that the war, which is now carried on, is between the people of the country and the Indians, the latter bearing great hatred to the former and attributing to them the cause of the war and the desire to expell their race. It is certain, that the Indians avoid meeting the regulars, as they have daily opportunities of attacking them on fair terms, and often when their numbers are superior to our parties. General Taylor left me this morning for Tampa. He has been very actively employed in arranging his squares and posting the Troops so as to afford a more sure protection to the settlements West of the Suwanee. He met Gov. Call and made arrangements with him for calling out the Militia to protect the country West of the Suwannee, while I have made similar arrangements with Col. Warren of the Florida Militia, for the protection of the settlements East of the Suwanee; it is between the road leading from Fort Heileman to Tallahassee and this Post, that the Indians are now operating in small parties probably because they find it dangerous longer to continue among the settlements and are making their way southwardly to avoid the troops posted in the squares, availing themselves on their way of every opportunity to do all the mischief in their power by attacking defenceless and isolated individuals. If that be the fact, we are in hopes of driving them below the 28" degree of North Latitude and if they can be kept there, they can hereafter do little or no injury, as the coast is now covered from St. Augustine to Key Biscayene by forts and cruisers. It is possible, that those going South, may be on their way to meet their brethren in that quarter, to consider the propriety of attending to the invitation to meet me at this post. The indians of late have been very shy of meeting us, as they are apprehensive that we are always laying plans for entrapping them and it is difficult to make them beleive that we have any other view than that of seizing them and forcing them on board of vessels for their transportation to the West. If they go South and are permitted to remain quiet for some time and they cease their hostile operations, in the course of time we may induce them to emigrate; but it is utterly impossible, unless we have an immense force, one large enough to cover the whole country with posts, to subdue them. They will not fight unless forced to it, and as the country is so vast and so full of dense swamps and hammocks it is not difficult for them to evade our pursuit. If I shall not be able to induce them to meet me as invited, it appears to me the best plan to pursue, will be to Settle the country by allowing every able bodied man, who will come into the country and settle on the public domain three years, 320 acres of land, bring with them their arms. They can settle in the vicinity of the military posts from which they would receive protection and in a little while they would be stronger than the Indians and thus force them out of the country; or if permitted to remain, the Indians would become perfectly harmless and even serviceable to the inhabitants in many ways, as they are not always unwilling to work for wages or compensation in goods or money. I transmit herewith a copy of a letter from Brig. Genl. Taylor asking to be relieved from the command of the troops in this territory dated 1" May and also a copy of my letter to him in answer thereto.” I have the honor to be Sir, with great respect your most obedient Servant ALEX: MACOMB Major General Com" in Chief HON.

<source>[LC:Tallahassee, The Floridian, May 4, 1839]</source>
<place-time><month>May</month><year>1839</year></place-time>
<docbody>THE MAILS.—Since our notice of the irregularity in the mails, we have received several communications from Post Masters on the routes from Tallahassee east and west. The P. M. at Miccasukie states that there is no mail to that place and the packages for that office are detained at Bailey's Mills, and carried over to Miccasukie by private conveyance. We are likewise informed that the mail for Monticello is sometimes too small to contain all the packages, which lay over in such care at the Tallahassee P. O. This will account for the occasional failure at the Miccasukie office.—We hope this will be corrected in future. Mr. Kenan, P. M. at Quincy, writes us that the packages for that place are sometimes forwarded in the Northern mail, which comes under the brass lock, and can only be opened at a distributing office. He says, “on the 4th inst there was but one package received here by the way mail from Tallahassee, and that was from Salubrity. I sent the mail under the brass lock northward, as I should have done. On the 12th one bundle of the Star, of the 3d, for this place was received by the Northern Mail. The other bundle of the Star of that date was received by the Tallahassee mail on the 14th. On the 12th, the letters for this office, mailed in Tallahassee on the 3d, were received by the Northern Mail. The fault most assuredly originated at the P. O. in Tallahassee.” If Mr. Kenan is correct, the way packages and those for the west have been put in the wrong mail bag at the Tallahassee P. O. But we are informed by the P. M. at Chattahoochee, that he finds no difficulty in opening the “Brass Lock,” (which occasionally comes to that office,) with the common key, simply by a light tap of a hammer upon the key. We would suggest the same process to the Quincy P. M. should a failure again occur in the receipt of packages due that office. Again on the 1st May, Mr. Keenan writes “That you may see with your own eyes that errors occur at Tallahassee, I have put under an envelope to your address a bundle of the Floridian, of Nov. 17, 1838, directed to “St. Pedro, Fla., which was received here on Sunday last, by the western mail; on Monday I put it in the Tallahassee mail, and on Tuesday it came back here in the Tallahassee mail.” We publish the above extracts in justice to the P. M. at Quincy, as we have no disposition unnecessarily to censure any one. A little more care and attention at the post offices would save a deal of trouble and perplexity to all parties. </docbody>

It is desirable that the commander of the Steamer Poinsett should proceed, as early as practicable, with that vessel to the coast of Florida, and cruise along the Atlantic shore with it, and other vessels belonging to the War Department which will be placed under his command, and among the Keys off the Southern point of that coast, for the purpose of intercepting all communication between the Indians and the fishing or other boats, from the island of the Bahamas or Cuba; of protecting all vessels that may be cast on shore, or otherwise in distress on that coast, and of co-operating with the land forces under General Taylor in preventing all communication between the whites and Indians, and in the prosecution of the war against the Seminoles, if it should unfortunately be renewed. The commander of the Squadron will place himself in communication with the officer commanding the land forces, in order to learn what points of the coast are considered by him most exposed, and where the presence of the vessels under his command may be most useful, as well as to co-operate in any military operations, if they should again become necessary to Suppress Indian hostilities in the Territory of Florida.” Very Respectfully Yr Mo Obt.

<docbody>BVT. BRIG. GENERAL Z. TAYLOR Commanding Army of the South Wia, Garey's Ferry, Florida. SIR, General Macomb having succeeded in making an arrangement with the Indians of Florida, by which it is agreed that they shall retire within certain limits in the South Western corner of that territory and be permitted to remain there until other and permanent arrangements shall be made by the Government, it is desirable that you adopt efficient measures to protect them in the quiet possession of the district of country thus set apart for their temporary residence.” The district designated by the General is comprised within the following boundaries viz—Beginning at the most Southern point of land between Charlotte Harbor and the Coloosahatchee or Sanybel river, opposite to Sanybel Island: thence into Charlotte Harbor, by the Southern pass between Pine Island and said Point along the eastern shore of said harbor to Talak Chopko or Pease Creek: thence up that river to Hatchee-Thloko or Big Creek: thence up said Creek to its source: thence Eastwardly to the Northern point of Lake Istopoga: thence along the Eastern outlet of said Lake, called Istopoga Creek, to the Kissimmie river: thence southwardly down the Kissimmie to Lake Oke-chobee: thence south through said Lake to Echalahatchee or Shark river: thence down said river Westwardly to its mouth: thence along the sea shore Northwardly to the place of beginning. In order to render effective this agreement entered into between the General and the Seminoles, the most vigorous measures must be adopted, and the utmost vigilance exercised to prevent the Whites from intruding on the territory thus set apart. The territory is accordingly, by order of the President of the United States, declared to be Indian territory, to which are applicable all the provisions of the Act of the 30" of June 1834, entitled, “An Act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve peace on the frontiers.” 86 You are therefore instructed to extend to the Indians in Florida every aid in your power in removing as soon as possible within the limits of the district thus assigned to them: and to use your best endeavours to prevent any white person from passing into said Indian territory, without written authority or license to do so. You will allow no one to trade with the Indians without a license, and then only under the strict supervision of an Officer of the regular Army: and if any person in violation of your orders attempts to do so, you will remove him forthwith and seize whatever merchandize he may have introduced into the Indian territory. Neither will you, on any pretext, whatever, suffer any white person to settle within the limits aforesaid.—You will exercise the utmost vigilance, and take the most energetic measures, to prevent the introduction of Ardent Spirits among the Indians, and if any be found within the district, you will seize and destroy it.—To carry into full effect these instructions you are authorised to make such use and disposition of the Military force under your command as you may judge proper.” J.

<docbody>JOSEPH S. SANCHES Esq." United States Marshall for the District of East Florida St Augustine. SIR, Evidence having been furnished to the President that individuals have intruded themselves upon the military reservation at Tampa Bay, East Florida,” he directs that you proceed without delay, and remove them therefrom under the provisions of the Act of March 3" 1807,” entitled “An Act to prevent settlements being made on lands ceded to the United States until authorized by law.” You will satisfy yourself of the shortest period within which the intruders can make their arrangements for removal, and depart from the reservation without serious loss or sacrifice of the property which they may have to take away with them, and you will take care promptly to make known to them that it is expected they will not delay beyond that period, as, should they do so, it will become your duty to remove them by force. It is hoped however that a resort to force for this purpose, which by the Act above mentioned the President is authorized to employ, will not be necessary but that they will promptly depart on being informed of the determination of the Executive not to permit them to remain. Should you, however, unfortunately be obliged to resort to force in order to accomplish the object of these instructions, you are authorized to call for such as you may deem absolutely necessary, on the commanding Officer at Fort Brooke, Tampa Bay, who will be instructed to comply with your requisition. In this event, also, you will act with as much forbearance, consideration and delicacy, as may be consistent with a prompt and faithful performance of the duty hereby assigned you; first fully and mildly explaining the folly of resistance on their part, and your own want of discretion in the matter.

I enclose herewith a copy of my correspondence with him on that subject to which I invite the particular attention of the Department.

It is known to you that Mr Duval left the Territory on the 15" of May 1837, the very day on which he was appointed Secretary, and notwithstanding the repeated orders of the Department, he did not return until the 16" of October following.” During the spring of 1838, he applied to you for leave of absence, which was refused, but he left Tallahassee and went to S* Joseph’s, and was at the seat of Government only a few days between the months of May and November, as will appear by the enclosed certificate of Mr R. B. Copeland, my private Secretary.” He has now left the Territory with his family to spend some time in Virginia notwithstanding my expressed disapprobation of this measure— I desire that the whole correspondence on the subject may be read, but ask particular attention to M. Duvals letter of the 2" Ins” A copy of that letter was industriously circulated by M. Duval among certain persons on the day it bears date, just as he was in the act of leaving this place, and before he deposited the original in the Post office from whence I received it, more than 24 hours after his departure—It contains many false statements, but there is onesufficiently malicious, to justify my proving it false. He says “I presided at a meeting of the citizens of Tallahasse where you and your minions were severely rebuked for your covert attack upon the President, and Secretary of War.” The proceedings of the meeting to which he refers a copy of which is herewith enclosed, marked B." proves his statement to be false. Further evidence of his disregard of truth is given by the enclosed extract from an editorial article of the Newspaper in which the proceedings of the meeting were published. But proof of the falsehoods beyond explanation. or contradiction, is given in the proceedings of the meeting held on the 29th January 1838.* and the certificates of many of the most respectable gentlemen of this city who were present, and heard M. Duval disclaim publicly any intention in the proceedings of the meeting of which he was President to cast the least censure whatever on my conduct. These latter documents are herewith enclosed marked C. The malicious design of M" Duval in giving utterance to this falsehood is too apparent. He was informed by my first note of my intention to report his conduct through you to the President and he had the weakness to believe that by a malicious slander and a deliberate falsehood, in representing me the enemy and himself the advocate of the President, his neglect of duty might be excused—It is for the President to decide whether the conduct of M" Duval has not been such as to require his removal from Office.* Yours Respectfully R K CALL HON: J. FORSYTH Secty. of State [Addressed] Honb' J. Forsyth Secty of State [Endorsed] The Sectry of State will inform MF Duval that it is the Presidents directions that he return to his post after he has made a visit to his children so as to reach there by the first of August— M.W.B.

<docbody>BRIGADIER GENERAL Z. TAYLOR Tampa Bay, Florida. SIR, The Department has heard with sentiments of great regret that the house of a respectable citizen of Middle Florida, has been destroyed by the Indians, and a part of the family murdered—No doubt every possible effort has already been made to prevent a repetition of the outrage; and it is presumed that the Officer charged with the defence of that portion of the Territory, exercised all the vigilance in his power to prevent its occurrence.—It appears necessary, therefore, to augment your force in Middle Florida, and sooner than such shocking scenes should be reiterated, you will be justified in calling into service a sufficient power to protect, effectually, every exposed plantation— In renewing hostilities against this savage foe, you will, of course, distinguish between the Indians who in good faith have retired to the territory assigned to them, and those who are committing the depredations complained of—Possibly the former might be persuaded to constrain the latter to act differently, or to take up arms against them—You are authorized, therefore, to make the most liberal offers to the Indians within the line, to induce them to unite with your forces.** .

<docbody>Division of the Territory, or East Florida a Distinct Territorial Government. At a full meeting of the Inhabitants of the City of St. Augustine, East Florida, held pursuant to public notice, at the Court House, on Thursday the 29th day of August, 1839, General Joseph M. Hernandez was appointed President, and Major J. John Beard, Jr. and S. Hill Williams, Secretaries of the meeting. The object of the meeting was explained, and the meeting addressed by Major Putnam, and several other gentlemen. On motion it was Resolved, That the following gentlemen, viz:—Gabriel W. Perpall, Esq., Gen. Peter Sken Smith, Col. John M. Hanson, Bernardo Segui, Esq., and Col. Gad Humphreys, be a Committee to draft Resolutions, expressive of the sense of the meeting. The Committee having retired, reported the following resolutions, which were adopted by acclamation, and without a dissenting voice: Resolved, That as Floridians—as American citizens—we are gratified at the presence at this time, of the same Men and the same Spirit that were present in the meeting of the fifth day of February, 1838, to protest against the calling a Convention to form a State Constitution— and against the imposition of State Taxes—and, to organize in favor of “Division.” Resolved, That we have not, at any time, “yielded” our preferences, or compromised our principles—we are—as we were, in that first meeting—“one and all, opposed to being erected into a State with the Middle and West—and one and all for separating The East, from the Middle and West—making the Suwannee the dividing line.” Resolved, That we have organized for ‘Division’ and nothing but “Division,” and for the purpose of cooperating with our Fellow- Citizens of The East, for the Division of This Vast Territory—comprising as it does, The Country and The Capabilities sufficient for Two States; the West being nearly equal in size to Massachusetts and Maryland combined: and nearly as large as South Carolina:—and the Territory lying East of the “Suwannee” possessing an area approaching in extent Pennsylvania or New York, and equal in extent to Tennessee or Michigan. Resolved, That a glance at our Geographical position, shows that the natural outlet of the Middle and West, is to the Gulf of Mexico— while The East has its natural outlet to the Atlantic coast—thus, from the beginning, nature designed The Separation—That subsequently, the conflicting and diversified interests of The Floridas demanded and obtained—and in seeking Division, we only seek to establish The Right of Separation that had its foundation in the Justice and Policy of the Spanish and English Governments, under which, The Floridas were formed into Two separate Provinces, each having its own Governor; and they were so ceded by Spain to the United States. Resolved, That the Constitution and Laws of the United States having established the Federal Ratio of State Representation at Forty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred—and as in the Census that preceded the late Territorial Convention, the aggregate population of The Floridas fell Ten Thousand short of the Federal Number, we consider a “Constitution,” emanating from the representatives of a minority a Dead Letter—whether approved or rejected by the Territory at large. Resolved, That adhering to the principle of “Division,” we do maintain the “birth right” of The East to a separate and Independent Territory East of the Suwannee;" while with mingled feelings of kindness and respect we would say to the Middle and West “Is not the whole land before us? Let there be no strife between us, for we be brethren.” Resolved, That again, as before, we enter our public and solemn Protest against the premature, impracticable, and ruinous scheme of precipitating the whole of this great Territory into a single State:— when the People of The East have, with such commendable unanimity, rejected both The State and The Constitution, at the Ballot-Box. Resolved, That the inability, as also the indisposition of The East, to participate in the mere pageant of A State Government, upheld by Direct Taxes, is apparent to all—and we should be still more reluctant to exchange our Territorial Independence for State honors, purchased by the degrading and humiliating condition, that the Middle and West pay the Taxes of the East! Resolved, That we shall support, for office, men who are opposed to forming The Floridas into a single State, and opposed to the system of Taxes, inseparable to the adoption of a State Gonernment—and who are the uncompromising advocates of “Division.” Resolved, That we respectfully solicit the inhabitants of the Towns and Counties of the East to hold similar meetings—and we most respectfully ask, for these proceedings, the attention of the Hon. Charees Downing; our delegate in Congress, with the assurance of our undiminished confidence in his ability and faithfulness to effect The Division, so ardently desired by his constituents in the East, and Vitally important to the welfare of the East. Resolved, That in petitioning for The Division of The Floridas, we appeal with confidence to the wisdom, justice, and patriotism of the distinguished Statesmen who represent Our Common Country, In The Councils of The Nation, at Washington. They can appreciate the importance of The Two States of Florida, to the Southern portion of the confederacy, and to The Union. Resolved, That these proceedings be signed by the President and Secretaries, and published in the papers of this City; the “Tallahassee Star;” the paper at Jacksonville; the Charleston and Savannah papers; the “Globe”, and the “National Intelligencer,” Washington JOSEPH M. HERNANDEZ, President. J. JOHN BEARD : Secretaries S. HILL WILLIAMS. • Memorial. To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress Assembled: Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray, that your Honorable body will give such consideration to the wishes of the Citizens of East Florida, as expressed in the sentiments of the Resolutions passed, and that you will pass a Law erecting and organizing that portion of Florida which lies East of the Suwannee River, into a Territory, separate and distinct from the other parts of the Territory of Florida– and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray."

<docbody>HON” SECTY OF NAVY, SIR, I have the honor to inform you since my last communication from this place, Chitto Tustee Nuggee has been to this post, but not accompanied by Sam Jones, and some other chiefs as was expected by Lt Col Harney" with a view to conclude something like a treaty which has been going on ever since the Col" returned from the Massacre of Coloosa Hatchee, Chitto brought in thirty two short sticks, wishing that many days to get some other cheif in, and to make arrangements as far as I can learn to conclude the treaty &amp;c. I was requested to attend the meeting but disclaimed all right on my part to make treaties, being as I considered sent here to enforce those already made, but at the same time felt bound to protest against two of the propositions, the first was that of allowing the Indians to occupy any part of the sea board of Florida, and the second that the Indians should not be allowed to disturb the property of wrecked vessels on the coast. It having been proposed that they should occupy a certain extent of this coast and to take the property cast on shore, but to save the lives of all on board. I made the objections above stated that it may not be said that I was present, and made no opposition, I do not believe that the Indians on this coast will ever go against those who are on the Coloosa Hatchee, but they wish to gain time for collecting amunition and stores, By this attempt at making a second treaty the forces under my command cannot I find, act against the Indians on the East coast without coming directly in contact with the views of Col Harney Commanding this district, which I certainly have every wish to avoid. I do think that every Indian taken beyond the limits prescribed in the treaty made by Gen' Macomb should be sent out of Florida, and should like very much to know if such is, or is not the wish of the Government. I have been delayed here two days in getting the Steam Boat W* Gaston, Cap' Poinsett off the beach, and do believe but for our assistance she would have been lost- I am sir, your ob" Serv" I MAYO Com" expedition on coast of Florida [Endorsed] Return Ack" 11 Oct 1839 M 343 Oct. 5 Voor</docbody>

<docbody>To the Hon: the Senate &amp; House of Representatives in Congress assembled— The Undersigned citizens of Calhoun County of which Saint Joseph is the chief Port &amp; public site, would respectfully urge the justice and necessity of creating a new District for the collection of customs to be called the District of Saint Joseph—embracing the coast east of Choctawhatchee Bay and North and West from Cape St. Blas, including said Cape, together with the coast and shore surrounding the Bay of St Joseph- The increasing resources &amp; trade foreign and coastwise of the Port of St: Joseph render the establishment of such a District, important to Government &amp; essential to commerce— The certificate attached from the Collectors office showing the imports &amp; exports of the three last years taken in connection with the completion of a new Rail Road into the interior which will much increase our facilities &amp; consequently our trade show the reasonableness of the application now made— The Committee to whowm may be entrusted the consideration of this Memorial are respectfully refered for further information touching the premisses to the Hon the Delegate for Florida The Undersigned would also ask from your Honourable body an appropriation for the survey of the Bay of St Joseph and for placing Buoys on the Bar and middle Ground near the entrance into the same-Warious opinions predicated upon the Spanish and more recent, but partial surveys, are entertained as to the depth of water over the Bar—All however agree that there is sufficient water to admit a Sloop of War and that the safety of access would be much increased by Buoys placed at Judicious points—The exposed condition of commerce and Ships of war on the Gulf in the event of a war with a marantime power render it the duty and policy of Government to avail themselves of every Port in which our Wessels might seek safety and protection—To the Delegate for Florida who is personally ac- quainted with the advantages of this location we would again beg to refer for such further information as may be required ” - S" Joseph FLORIDA 1" October 1839 M Howard V R.

<place-time><location>Land Office at S*AUGUSTINE E. F.</location><month>October</month><date>13</date><year>1839</year></place-time>
<docbody>JAMES WHITCOMB Esq Commissioner of Gen Land Office SIR Your communication, dated the 26 Ultimo,” did not reach this office, until the arrival of the mail yesterday, (12” Inst). making a period of seventeen days.— You state, that “after the removal (by death), of the late Receiver of the S* Augustine Land Office, it was discovered, he had issued a number of receipts for moneys received in payment for the public lands of which there had not been any entry made; either upon the Township plats, or books of the Land-Office—thereby defrauding the Government, and throwing the business of the Office into an almost inextricable state of confusion”— With the above facts, we certainly have nothing to do. You say again “I regret to state, that evidence has been filed in this office from which it would appear, that the present incumbent, has been pursuing the same course, several receipts and certified copies of receipts, have been exhibited here, purporting to be for moneys received in payment of public lands entered at the S" Augustine Land Office, and of which no official returns have been made by either of you.” With this latter clause, we have every thing to do, and trust we shall be able to explain matters to your entire satisfaction. That there would be occasionally, official receipts filed in your office, for lands entered here is no more than what we expected, would take place, from the preciptancy of individuals in applying for Patents, and their ignorance of the Forms to be gone through, before they could obtain them. We were also aware, that there were other Persons, likely to trouble the Department unnecessarily—Persons to whom, in consideration of the distance from which they had come, and their inability to meet, without great inconvenience, the expense of repeating their journey; we allowed to enter the Lands they wanted; though they were unprepared, from their ignorance of the Lands, to comply strictly with all the conditions of the Sale. It was however, only where these deviations from Form were of an unessential character, and where the difficulty of making a correct return of the sales, was such as could be easely removed by the party, on returning to his home; that we permitted entries to be made for the accomodation of the individual thus circumstanced. It has sometimes happened, that on refering to the maps, they were unable to ascertain with certainty, the precise location of the Land they sought; but requested the indulgence of being allowed to complete their entries; being willing to take the risk of any errors they might commit in doing so. In such cases, that is, where there appeared little likelyhood of the entries turning out to be erroneous—a Receipt has been issued to the purchaser, on his engaging to apprise us, should he discover any mistake on his return home; in order that the error might be corrected; in accordance with the rules laid down by the Department on this subject—or to notify us if there was none; so that a Return of the Sale might be made as early as possible. Many of the persons thus indulged, have neglected to comply with their promises—being probably satisfied on finding their Receipt to correspond with the public Surveys, and therefore troubling themselves no further about the matter. Similar reasons have prevailed in Preemption cases, where we were satisfied of the justness of the claim; &amp; where the individual who through ignorance, has presented informal Papers, which could be easily corrected on returning to his Residence. In all these cases, the persons were informed, that no Return would be made of the Sale, &amp; that they could not get their Patents, until they complied with the formalities of the Law. We presume therefore, that the Receipts offered at the Department, have been transfered from the original Holders, and that the Transferees have been left in ignorance of the conditions remaining to be complied with, before they can obtain their Patents. In pursuing the course we have done, in the above cases, we conceived we were forwarding the views of the Government, by disposing of the public Lands, &amp; at the same time securing it against fraud—as no Patent could issue, until the Return was made. We should perhaps sooner have stated, that in every instance, the sale was duly entered on the maps, &amp; recorded in the Books of the Office. If it be the desire of the Department, that a more strict adherence to Form, be observed for the future, what ever may be the hardships to individuals; we will receive its commands, and rigidly enforce them.” We have the honor to be, Sir, Very Respectfully, Your Ob" Servts— W. H. SIMMONS, Register. JOHN C. CLELAND Receiver [Endorsed] St Augustine 13* Oct 1839 The Register &amp; Receiver In rel. to Receiver's Receipt's given for lands sold &amp; of which no returns have been received at the Gen' L" Office, as Stated in Commr." letter of 26 Sept ’39–Give explanations respecting the S" Receipts, &amp; enclose a list of the same R* 26* October 1839. </docbody>

<docbody>BVT. BRIGR. GEN" Z. TAYLOR Commanding, &amp;c. Tampa SJR, The 34 Regiment of Artillery having been much reduced in numbers and physical strength, it is determined by the War Department to relieve it by another Regiment of Artillery. You are therefore requested to order the 3" Regiment to be assembled at Garey's Ferry to await the arrival of the relieving Regiments, which you may expect at an early day in good condition and complete as to numbers. The Secretary of War hearing so frequently of the depredations and murders, committed by the Indians along the line of the settlements, from St. Augustine to the extreme West of the Territory of Florida, has come to the conclusion of employing the whole of the regular force under your command, with such as may be added to it in driving the enemy out of the settlements, by occuping the country within, and north of a line drawn from Pilatka to the mouth of Withlacoochee, including Fort King, thence along the western coast, to Appilachicola River. You will therefore, as early as you shall find it practicable, take means for stationing the troops within the line above marked out, leaving detachments at such points, south of that line, as you may deem necessary and proper;—but the first and great object is, to rid the settlements of the marauding parties of Indians which have so long and so dreadfully annoyed the inhabitants of Florida, by destroying or driving them out of the settlements, and obliging them to retreat below the line indicated. The cruisers employed on the coast of Florida, it is presumed, are sufficient to afford protection from the attacks and depredations of the Indians to such vessels and their crews as may be stranded. It is not however intended by this remark to advise the abandonment of the posts of Tampa and Key Biscayne.— Besides the Regiment of Artillery mentioned as the relief of the 3" Regiment of Artillery, six full companies of the 2" Dragoons will immediately be put in motion under Colonel Twiggs for Florida.— I am sir, &amp;c.

<docbody>SIR, On the 1* May last, John C. Cleland, Receiver of public moneys at St. Augustine, Florida, executed a bond in the penalty of $30.000– Doubts being entertained as to the sufficiency of the security on such bond, which, on enquiry at a proper source, were confirmed, M" Cleland was required on the 13* July last to execute another bond with additional security,” which he has not yet done nor assigned reasons for the delay— This office having received intimation of the issue of some receipts by said Receiver of which no official returns had been made and having been furnished with a notarial Copy of three receipts so issued, a communication was addressed to the Receiver and Register jointly on the 26* Septem" last,” a copy of which is enclosed here- with, requiring proper explanations of such proceedings and the same to be accompanied by a list of all such cases and the officers were advised that unless the explanations were satisfactory I would be under the necessity of reporting the facts to the Executive—A letter of explanation from those officers * has been received and deeming the proceedings therein acknowledged to be not only improper but contrary to law I beg leave to call your attention to the subject— The officers accompany their reply with a list which is thus headed,— “A list of receipts granted to individuals of lands entered on the maps and recorded on the books of the Land office at St. Augustine, but not returned to the General Land office for want of the proper formalities required by law and the regulations of this office.”— It is preceived however that this entirely omits the three cases of receipts, copies of which as before stated have been filed in this office— It thus appears that the Receiver has received moneys on public account and furnished to individuals evidence thereof without apprizing the Government of his Acts and thereby furnishing the Means of holding him responsible— The course of proceeding prescribed in making private entries of land is for the purchaser to make his application in writing to the Register, describing the particular tract and on the same paper the Register is required to certify the fact of such application having been made and the amount of purchase money payable to the Receiver on the land—The Receiver is Required to issue Receipts in duplicate, one of which is for the purchaser and the other is to be handed to the Register to be entered upon his books—The Register is required to issue his Certificates of purchase for the same, which Certificates, with the Receiver's receipts are Required to be forwarded by the Register with his abtract of Sales at the Close of each Month.— Neither the Register nor Receiver has rendered abstracts embracing these cases nor is it known that Certificates have been issued by the Register for the same, and without which patents cannot issue in any CaSe- The Register has addressed a separate letter dated 14* Ultimo" wherein he disavows any knowledge of receipts being granted irregularly other than those explained in the joint letter—It therefore would appear that he is ignorant of the three receipts before referred to and such ignorance can enly be accounted for only on the supposition that the Receiver withheld the information from him— It is proper to remark that the Sales of lands were ordered to be suspended until the additional bond shall have been duly executed."— The foregoing facts with the accompanying correspondence are respectfully submitted for the consideration of the Executive *— I have the honor to remain very respectfy, Sir, Yr Obt Ser' JA* WHITCOMB, Commissioner HON: LEVI WOODBURY Secretary of the Treasury [Endorsed] Commissioner of G.

<docbody>SIR, Since my communication of yesterday in relation to the irregular proceedings of the Land officers at St Augustine an investigation of the pre-emption claims admitted by them has been made, (the outlines of which are indicated in the accompanying paper”) which developes much deviation from the positive provisions of law and prescribed rules of office, as, in connection with the circumstances set forth in my communication of yesterday, to require that the affairs not only of the Receiver's office but also those of the Register's should pass into other hands— It is not hereby designed to reflect on the Motives of those officers but simply to express the opinion that from the little attention they have bestowed towards qualifying themselves for the duties of their respective offices during their long term of Service, it seems expedient for the welfare of the public business that the proposed changes should be made— With great respect Yr Obt St JA* WHITCOMB, Comm” HON LEVI WooDBURY Secretary of the Treasury [Endorsed] Comm. of G.

<docbody>HON SECTY OF NAVY, SIR, I have the honor to inform you that I arrived here yesterday from Key Biscayne. It was my wish to have stoped at, or off the army Posts, on the eastern Coast, but was only enabled to stop for a few minutes off Fort Lauderdale, as the leanght of the run is so great, that with the Boat loaded down with fuel it can be just accomplished, without making allowances for Gales, or head winds which might prove disastrous: as even a delay of a few hours, would leave her without fuel, and her overloaded condition at the commencement of the run would unfit her for heavy weather, all of which I have stated in a former report. The Engineer reports the engine out of order and as there is an Inspector here appointed under the act of Congress; establishing such an officer. I have requested him in conjunction with the two engineers of the Poinsett to examine into and make a report upon the condition of the Machinery, which report will accompany this. The Poinsett cannot be run upon this station but at a very heavy expense, she is useless on the east coast and the Barges can operate in the Bays, and small rivers, without her assistance, getting their supplies from our store house at Key Biscayne or being supplied with army rations as is now done at Fort Lauderdale. The illicit traffic supposed to be carried on with the Indians where she could act, does not exist, the whole coast from Key Biscayne South is lined with wreckers who are jealous of foreigners, and are ready to prevent their ingress, and this useful class of men are too much interested in the exterpation of the Indians to refuse any assistance they can render for this purpose. The great difficulty of obtaining wood operates as another check, to the efficiency of the Poinsett, she lies idle in Port whilst we are obtaining fuel for a short run, which is pleasant enough for one disposed to be inactive, and even when the Barges are all on duty, a number of officers and men must remain on board as ship Keepers, and their services are comparatively lost. The Barges carry the tents for the Crew, and a weeks provisions or more if required, can move from one point to another, either alone or cooperating with the land Forces. I conceive it to be my duty to recommend the withdrawal of the Poinsett from this station, and to relieve all officers attached to her, from service in Florida, who rank those who have command of small vessels on this station, at least such as may request it; it is painful to me to have the question or rank continually agitated, and I see there can be no harmony as matters now are—may lead to difficulties most unpleasant.

<docbody>W" H. SIMMONS, Esq Register, S*Augustine Florida. SIR. You were advised by communication from this Office bearing date the 11" inst." that Charles M*Dougal, Esq. had been appointed to succeed Mr Cleland in the Office of Receiver of Public Moneys at S*Augustine. Accompanying the joint communication from the late Receiver and yourself bearing date the 13" Ult”" in reply to my letter of the 26* September last " is a list thus entitled: “List of receipts granted to individuals of lands entered on the Maps and recorded on the books of the Land Office at S* Augustine but not returned to the General Land Office for want of proper formalities required by law and the regulations of this Office”— I am instructed to call on you for a particular explanation of the reasons which induced you to give your sanction to the issuing of receipts in the irregular manner alluded to, without reporting such informal proceedings to this Office, with the reasons which, under your own construction of your Official authority and sense of duty, might be plead in justification of the course pursued, by which this Office has been Officially uninformed of proceedings evidenced by your Records,-and until the receipt of the explanation now required under the President’s direction, and his decision thereon communicated to you I have it in charge to direct that no further sales be attempted at your Office— You are also requested to transmit to this Office the proof under the pre-emption law of 1834 upon which entries 8–46–47–49–82 (97)—120 (135)–122 (137)–123 (138)–124–134–135–140 (156)–190 (206)–195 (211)–197 (213) and 228 (250) were permitted to be made,” and also the proof under the pre-emption law of 1830 upon which entry N° 235 (257) was allowed and in the latter case to report the date of the filing of the plat in your Office.— In all the entries of pre-emptions under the Act of 1838 * except No: 333 You have neglected to require of the claimant the affidavit pointed out by that Act or if required and furnished by them you have neglected to transmit the same to this Office. The law not only makes such affidavit absolutely necessary for the obtaining of a patent but attaches such penalties to false swearing as to render it an essential requisite to the proper allowance of the claim, inasmuch as the party although he should have complied with all the other provisions of the law is nevertheless not entitled to its benefits if unable truly to make the affidavit required. In the instructions of the 3" July 1838" under the Act alluded to, page 4, in the 4” paragraph, as well as page 6, first paragraph, your attention was drawn to the provision of the law. In numerous cases both under the law of 1834 &amp; 1838 you have admitted entries of single forty acre tracts, and adjoining subdivisions of the same character, of different quarter Sections, contrary to the law and instructions. The laws of 1834" &amp; 1838 revive that of 1830 * and subdivisions known to the latter act are therefore alone liable to entry under either of the former—The forty Acre subdivisions were admitted by a subsequent law,-that of 5" of April 1832 ” entitled “An Act supplementary to the several laws for the sale of public lands”—and are liable to entry only under the provisions of that Act &amp; according to the peculiar terms &amp; circumstances pointed out by it—In a large number also of the cases under the Act of 1838 you have permitted the entry upon proof, not of the possession by the claimant by personal residence on the tracts at the times specified by law but “until the commencement of Indian hostilities”—“until 1835 when Seminole War compelled an abandonment”—“until driven away by Indian hostilities”—Those cases would have formed possibly good ground for an application to Congress, but you had no authority to allow them. In other cases the proof states that the parties were on a Certain Section, and parts of that Section are entered.—The proof should have stated them to have been house-keeping &amp;c. on the particular legal subdivision entered,—as a claimant might have been a Settler on the North East quarter of a particular Section without being entitled to enter either of the other three quarters—Warious other irregularities exist which are capable of correction and need not now be particularly mentioned as they will form the subject of Special communications when the cases are separately acted upon- Your explanation, as speedily as possible, is required on all the particulars herein set forth and in reference to the cases of receipts, of which a notarial Copy has been furnished to this Office, (alluded to in my communication of the 26* September last)” and of which a copy is herewith furnished, the Secretary of the Treasury requires that you will report whether the amounts of money therein stated were included in the returns made by the Receivers to the Department of moneys on hand. Notwithstanding the suspension of actual sales of public lands as herein directed, in case individuals claiming pre-emption privileges under the Act of 1838 should present to your Office proofs in support of such claims you are to receive their papers for future Action and report the fact of your having so done to this Office. I am respectfully Sir, Your Ob" Serv" JA* WHITCOMB Commissioner. </docbody>

<docbody>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. STATES SIR. As I have been in this City for more than a month, it was with surprise &amp; mortification that I learned for the first time on Sunday last that two important offices in the Territory I represent had been vacated &amp; filled, nearly a fortnight ago, &amp; I kept in utter ignorance of the intended removals, as well as of the appointments— As I have always understood and believed, that the immediate representative of a State or Territory was looked to by the adminstration, as the best source of information as to the fitness of applicants for offices within his district, more especially where the member or delegate is friendly to the adminstration, I can consider the course pursued on the two Several occasions alluded to, as furnishing evidence, that towards me, the common forms of Courtesy &amp; respect, official and personal, need not be observed. Believe me Sir, that I should not trouble you on this occasion, but in justice to the people I represent,-You have removed Mr Duval and Mr Cleland; of Mr Duval's case I will say nothing, because I know nothing—I never had an oppertunity to form an opinion,— With Mr Clelands case, I am now acquainted—There is, as I am now informed, but one reason for his removal—to wit, that he gave informal receipts, which he did not return to the Land office—Now this is as plain, as simple and as proper, as any act can be.—A man rides 150 miles to enter lands and finds the office closed by orders from Washington, or some other cause to prevent the entry.—he leaves the money with Cleland, as a private friend, to pay the money when the land could be entered—this is what Cleland calls an informal receipt—It was entirely a private transaction, with which the Land office has nothing to do, &amp; intended to save the applicant another ride to S". Augustine,—Now Sir, Mr Clelands successor, is not a citizen of Florida, is totally unknown amongst us, &amp; until this appointment, I who know every body, in that section of the Country, had never heard of him,-And I venture to predict, that he will be found to be some relative or protagee of Mr Whitcomb, who finds him a place, by the removal of Mr Cleland—He is recommended by a man totally unknown at Washington, and exceedingly obnoxious to many of the most respectable citizens at home, &amp; who, from personal and political hatred to Cleland, would recommend any one, to remove him, or any other of my friends— Mr Duval's successor I do know, tho' I do not know who prescribed his name to the Executive; and I deeply lament that the appointment was made, I know nothing to the discredit of M" M°Kants, but his talents and qualifications do not fit him for such a station—And I look upon Florida as peculiarly unfortunate; left as she is to her own resources for defence, from the deadly foe that threatens under the defensive system now adopted by the war dep" to desolate her fields forever, in having those resources liable to be placed by many contingencies in the hands of one so little able to use them, for her benefit, or defence— I will close this letter Sir, by most respectfully, but earnestly urging, that removals so unjust, appointments so unsatisfactory, may if possible be arrested, and that if these vacances must be made, other names may be sent in their stead, to the Senate— I am Sir Most Respg Y* Ob Ser C DOWNING Since writing this letter I learn that M" M*Dougal is a highly respectable gentleman a Surgeon belonging to the Army, &amp; now in the discharge of his duty in Florida [Endorsed] Refa to the Sect of the Treasury MVB D. 96 Nov 23 Lovejoy Washington, Nov. /39 Hon.

<place-time><location>WAR DEPARTMENT Nov.</location><date>29</date><year>1839</year></place-time>
<docbody>SIR. A state of things has for some time past existed in Florida, which I feel compelled at length to bring to your notice. As long as I did not apprehend any serious embarrassment to the public service from the conduct of the Governor of that Territory I avoided all mention of it, and if its effects were likely to be confined to multiplying the difficulties of this department I would continue to pass it over as I have done for so long a period. But the theatre of operations is about to be changed to Middle Florida and it has become necessary to transport thither the greater portion of the regular forces hitherto employed in the South. Thus brought into the neighborhood of the civil authorities the success of the measures of the general will depend altogether upon their cordial cooperation with him. It cannot be denied that such a result cannot be expected so long as the present Governor remains in power. He failed to acquire the respect of the army of the South when entrusted with the command of it by your immediate Predecessor; and ever since that period an unfriendly feeling has existed between the military and civil authorities to the great inconvenience of the service. This feeling constantly manifested by the Governor has lately been so openly avowed as to produce an effect upon all connected with the regular army, which if not counteracted may be attended with unpleasant and disasterous consequences. But the least of the many evil results of the protracted hostilities in Florida has been the unfriendly feelings which have sprung up between the regulars and militia serving there. From the nature of our institutions the success of all military operations is dependent upon the cooperation of those forces; and in the present state of the Treasury I have not the means if I had the inclination to enable me to withdraw the regular troops and substitute militia. In employing the former in preference I consult both economy and efficiency, and I should not be justified in making any other disposition of that portion now in Florida than has been done. Besides Governor Call, dissatisfied with the rejection of his offers to enlist a large body of militia for the service in Florida and of the urgent recommendations of his friends to have the whole command and conduct of the war entrusted to him, has publicly declared his intention to propose to the Legislature of Florida to furnish the necessary funds to provide for an army to act under the authority of the Territory, promising in that case to receive in the service certain militia corps assembled under the expectation of the success of this extraordinary application. Such a measure would bring this department into direct collision with the civil authorities of the Territory &amp; involve the Government in great immediate expense as well as lay the foundation of interminable claims upon the treasury. I am therefore reluctantly compelled to ask the removal of the present Governor as a measure rendered necessary by the character of the troops to be employed in Middle Florida, &amp; by the previous conduct and public declarations of this Functionary.” I have the honor to be Very respectfully Yr most obe" Ser" J. R. POINSETT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. [Endorsed] Mr. Poinsett's letter of Complaint against Gov. Call. Let Gov” Call be superseded &amp; Judge Reed appointed in his place M. W. B. 14 See the Secretary of War to the President, Dec. 10, 1839, post, XXVI.</docbody>
