GEORGE GRAHAM TO ROBERT BUTLER
[NA:GLO, Lets. to SG, II*]
GENERAL LAND OFFICE 9* July 1824.
COL” ROB" BUTLER, near Nashville, Tennessee.
SIR. I have the honor in compliance with directions from the
President of the US. to enclose a Commission of Surveyor of the Public
Lands in Florida, to which office he has appointed you.” It will be
necessary for you to take an oath of office, and enter into bond with
security for the faithful performance of your duties, the forms of which
are herewith forwarded. When executed you will forward them to this
Office with a certificate endorsed upon the bond, by the Judge or
District Attorney of the US. that the security is sufficient.
The 6* Section of the Act approved the 8" of May 1822, au-
thorizes the appointment of a Surveyor for Florida and desig-
nates his power and authority;" the 13 Section of the Act approved
the 3’d of March 1823" repeals the 6th Section of the Act of the 8th
of May 1822, but the 4th Section of the Act approved the 4th of May
1824,” must be so construed, to give effect to the intention of Congress,
as not only to authorize the appointment of a surveyor, but to invest
him with the powers and authority and impose upon him the duties
which are invested in, and required of him by the 6* Section of the
Act of the 8” of May 1822, with the exception of the authority to
charge fees for recording the plats and the surveys of private claims,
the surveying of these will be provided for, it is presumed when Con-
gress shall finally act upon the report of the Commissioners. The
object of your immediate appointment is to have surveyed with as
little delay as possible, a body of land adjacent to the Seat of Gover-
ment which is located in Gadsden C° and within which tract of
Country it is understood that there are but few, if any, private claims.
The 6* Section of the Act of the 8th of May 1822 invests the
Surveyor authorized to be appointed by the President with the same
power and authority as by law appertains to the Surveyor South of
the State of Tennessee—In relation therefore to the duties of your
Office generally, I beg leave to refer you to the Act regulating the
grants of, and providing for the disposal of the lands of the US, South
of the Tennessee, approved the 3" of March 1803* and to the laws
providing for the sale of the lands of the US. generally, all of which

The Attorney General having had occasion, in consequence of charges
brought against Gen' Rector, to take a review of the laws relative to
the duties of Surveyors, and the opinions in that review
the being deemed by the President to be correct, I enclose extracts
therefrom, marked A. which are to be taken and deemed as part of
your instructions."
I also enclose for your information several other papers marked
B. C. D. E. F. and G."
B. Is an extract from a letter from M. Gallatin to M. Briggs”
relative to the manner of numbering the sections in those Township
plats which contain private surveys; I accompany it by a diagram
which renders any further explanation unnecessary.
C. That marked C contains the forms for rendering y' accounts,”
these must be rendered to the Treasury quarter yearly, closed to the
last days of March, June, September, and December. In these
accounts all the monies advanced to you from the Treasury, will
be credited. The debits will consist of charges for services performed
by the Deputy Surveyors, pursuant to contracts to be made with
you, and for Incidental expenses, which will be limited to Books and
stationary for your Office. Your Salary accounts will be rendered
separately and the amount will be transmitted by the Treasury in
such manner as you may direct.
If monies are advanced on account which should not be done without
an absolute necessity, a list thereof is to be transmitted, and the
amount is to be stated as a component part of the balance to be
accounted for by you in a subsequent settlement.
Your accounts are settled by the 1* Auditor of the Treasury,
but they must be transmitted thro’ this Office, and cannot be taken
up for settlement by the Auditor, unless they are accompanied by
a Certificate from this Office that the lines charged for have been
run. The paper marked D. is a Copy of a letter to the Surveyors
from this Office in relation to this point.
The paper marked E. is the form of a contract with the Deputy
Surveyors; * on the subject of these Contracts I refer you to the
review of the laws taken by the Attorney General and alluded to

above, and I have to request that copies of all contracts entered into
by you be regularly returned to this office.
In entering into these Contracts you will exercise a sound dis-
cretion, having due regard to the local situation and facilities or
difficulties of Surveying the lands within the limits of each Contract.
The maximum price allowed by law is four dollars a mile, but it is
expected that the open piney or prairie Lands can be surveyed for
less, and that it will not be necessary for you to give the maximum
price in any instance, particularly as the Deputy Surveyors will not
be required as heretofore to make out the plats & calculations. Where
from the nature of the Country, peculiar difficulties & impediments,
arrest the progress of the Deputy Surveyor he should be renumerated
by including in his contract other Townships where such impediments
do not exist. Where there are extensive bodies of pine woods and
prairies unfit for cultivation, or unsaleable, none other than the
township lines should be run.
Plats of each Township are to be neatly and accurately protracted
according to law, on durable paper, by a scale of two inches to a mile,
which together with the field notes, are to be recorded in Books to
be kept in your office. Copies of the plats and field notes are to be
transmitted to this Office. They are to made out on good paper of
uniform size, and with such margin as will admit of being bound in
durable books.—
The paper marked F. is a copy of the instruction of the Secretary
of the Treasury, relative to the division of Fractional Sections"
To aid you in drawing up the necessary instructions to your Deputy
Surveyors, I enclose the paper marked G."
The President of the US. having decided that your office shall be
located at the place selected for the Seat of Government for the
Territory of Florida, you will repair to that place with all convenient
dispatch and enter upon the duties of your office.
Had the northern boundary line of Florida been a parrellel of latitude
in its whole extent, it would have been better to have made that your
principal basis parellel, and numbered all the Townships South from
that line, but as it is not, and as the lands required to be first surveyed
lye in the Neighborhood of the Seat of Government and as it will be
desireable in many points of view to have the Ranges and Townships
numbered from the Seat of Government you will cause the South East
corner of the section which may be selected by the Governor under the
is Instructions relative to the division of fractional sections pursuant to the
act of Apr. 24, 1820 (3 STAT. 566–567) are printed, Gen. Pub Acts . . . Instrs.

provision of the act of 4" May 1824, for the site of the permanent
Seat of Government to be fixed as the point from which the principal
meridian & principal parrelel shall be run, & it would be very desireable
that the latitude and longitude of this point should be accurately
established.—From the point thus fixed upon you will cause a Meridian
line to be run due North to the Northern boundary of the Territory
and due South to the Gulph of Mexico, and a parellel of latitude to be
run due East to the Atlantic Ocean which it will strike north of the
mouth of St John’s river and due West to the river Perdido; as this
line should be run with very great accuracy and as it will be a very
long one you should employ for that purpose one of your most skilful
Surveyors—the Ranges will be numbered East & West from the
Principal Meridian and the Townships North and South from the
Basis parellel—
It is very desireable that you should have prepared in due time,
twenty Townships immediately contiguous to the Seat of Gov'—so
that they could be proclaimed for Sale next winter or early in the
ensuing Spring. This quantity of land can no doubt be surveyed
without including any private claims, as Governor Duval has stated
in a letter addressed to the President that there are no private claims
in that section of the Country with the exception of a large grant
claimed by Forbes, through this grant the Township lines may be run,
but no township within which any private claims may lye, can be
subdivided into Sections until after the Commissioners shall have made
their report to Congress.
So soon as your Bond shall have been received and approved, a
remittance will be made to you by the Treasury of Seven thousand
dollars, to enable you to carry into effect these instructions."
I have the honor to be, With great respect Your Obed" Sev"

the Sum of $2000, for the faithful discharge of the trust. Forms
of the Oath & Bond are also enclosed. When taken and executed
you will transmit them to this office for approbation, together with

you will give him duplicate receipts, specifying every article.—
In relation to the transfer of Bonds outstanding, it is deemed
necessary to give you some special instructions in order to obviate
any difficulty that may arise in the settlement of your own or your
predecessor's accounts.—With that view I have to request that the
following lists of the bonds outstanding may be made out by you to
be forwarded by your predecessor
1. A list of the Bonds put in suit on which judgments have been
obtained.
2. A list of the Bonds put in suit on which judgments have not been
obtained.—
3. A list of the Bonds not yet due and placed in your hands.—
Forms of those lists are enclosed, from which you will perceive
that with respect to the bonds in suit, it is particularly necessary that
the partial payments made on them and to whom made should be
ascertained with the greatest precision, because for the balance of
these Bonds after deducting the partial payments added to the
amount of Bonds not yet due and placed in your hands you will be

GEORGE GRAHAM TO GOVERNOR DUVAL
[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 13.]
GEN. LAND OFFICE, July 10, 1824.
HIS EXCELLENCY W" P. DUVAL. Pensacola Florida
SIR, I have the honor to enclose you the copy of “an act providing
for a grant of land for the seat of Government in the Territory of
Florida, and for other purposes”” and also the copy of “an Act
granting to the Parishes or Counties of each State & Territory of the
US, in which the public lands are situated, the right of preemption
to quarter sections of land for Seats of Justice within the same.””
Under the provisions of the 4th section of the Act first mentioned
Col° Robert Butler of Tennessee has been appointed surveyor for
Florida,” and he has been instructed to repair with all convenient
dispatch to the point selected for the seat of Govern" for that Terri-
tory, and to establish and open his Office at that place.”
The point selected for the seat of Government will be selected for
the bases of all the surveying operations in Florida, and the ranges
and townships, numbered from that point, this will enable every
proprietor to ascertain with precision his relative situation in relation
to the Seat of Government. The object of the immediate appoint-
ment of a Surveyor, is to have the Lands, in Gadsden C° surveyed
into Townships, and such of the Townships subdivided as may not
contain private claims, and I expect that at least twenty townships
will be prepared and proclaimed for Sale as soon after the meeting of
Congress as the Land Officers for Florida can be organized.
Nothing can be done in relation to the surveying of the Private
claims until Congress shall legislate upon that subject”

ins** The silence of M Blair corresponds with my expectation and
I am confident it will be found to be the mere precursor for an apology,
that the pretended original has been lost or mislaid.
I have been informed by M. Graham that my letter in reference
to the public records” has been forwarded to Governor Duval, a meas-
ure I assure you, that will not be justified by the result. The sug-
gestions contained in my letter ought not to have been made public
and by the removal of the keeper of the Public Archives the security
of the official correspondence and the royal orders is not embrased.
In relation to Governor Duval as the officer to carry into effect the
resolution of the House of Representatives I frankly decline. I con-
sider it at least unfortunate—I have been informed by Moses E. Levy,
Charles Gobert and Fernando Arredondo that Wm P Duval while
Judge of the United States District Court was to receive from Arre-
dondo a compensation in lands for services to be rendered by him in
obtaining the confermation of a grant to Arredondo of 10 Miles
square. Had I remained in the Commission it was my intention,
when this Grant came under consideration, to have investigated this
matter thoroughly—Levy, Gobert and Arredondo are all inter-
ested.—I have but little doubt that Duval will appoint M Lancaster
brother in law to Mr Blair but should he appoint William Simmons,
an event not improbable the emergency of the case will not be met.
The purity of M" Simmons character his intelligence and patriotic
feelings qualify him in my estimation most peculiarly for a trust of
delicate confidence, while an inactivity of disposition renders him less
fit for a situation of constant attention—as M. Gibson does not enter-
tain the most exalted opinion of his Excellency it is not probable that
he will be selected—I am satisfied, the doubts of M" Monroe relative
to his power to interfer under the resolution of the House of Represent-
atives would have yielded to a full examination of all the acts of Con-
gress with reference to Florida. There is no act of Congress in force
approving of the proceedings of the Legislative Council. The act of
1822 continued in force those proceedings until the expiration of the
succeeding Council, since which there has been no confirmation and
as the organic law of that Territory forbid any legislation on the
public property and as the records were the exclusive property of the
United States no act operating upon those document can be valid
without an express sanction and I humbly apprehend if Congress had
known that an Act of the Leg. Council authorized the Keeper of the
P. Archives to place on record, under the approbation of the District

Attorney, any grants that may be produced a very different course
would have been pursued. The papers placeed in the possession of
Reynolds, Alvarez, and Caveda by an order from your department,
are not embrased by the statutes of the Leg. Council and are not so
held by those gentlemen. It is to these papers that the Congress
must look for an explanation of the powers to dispose of the lands in
Florida and which will probably be resorted to terminate the difficul-
ties that embarrass large claims in other parts of the United States—
I write this letter in the confidence that it will treated private as
I have no wish to impute unworthy motives to Governor Duval. To

HON” JoHN C. CALHOUN Secretary of War
SIR I have the honour to Acknowledge your two Letters of the
2** and 5* June last,” your directions in relation to the Manner of
Granting Licensences to Indians Traders shall be Specially attended
to—
I did not receive your letter of the 3" of May last,” in time, to have
furnished you with an Estimate of the Cost, which is likely to attend
the execution of the Treaty with the Florida Indians, The Sum of
Sixty five thousand Seven hundred Dollars, is not Sufficient to furnish
1500 Rations per day at 12% Cents each for One Year, I will not how-
ever exceed the Appropriations. If the most exact Economy will pre-
vent it—and as far as practicable I will Superintend in person all the
important matters in relation to the Contracts, takeing care to draw
them all myself, The Sum of Six thousand Dollars for Instruments of
Husbandry, Stock of Cattle & Hogs, five thousand Dollars the An-
nuity, Two Thousand Dollars for the Transportation of the Indians
to the lands assigned them, should as early as possible be deposited in
the Bank of the United States at New Orleans—The Thousand Dollars
for the Necessary tools and Materials and the hire of a Gun Smith,
should be at the same time deposited with the Sums before Specified,
I am decidley of Opinion that the $1.000 will not be more than suffi-
cient to build a Shop, purchase the Tools, and Materials for the first
Year, I have already Ordered the Tools & Materials to be brought

I send you on my Estimates, of the probable expence of Rations
for the Indians for One Year—they must be furnished at two Points
Tampa bay and at some point near lake George on S' Johns River, at
this place some Rations must be furnished at least at present and
untill the Indians are moved from this Quarter—
Last night a Company of 4* Infunder the Command of Cap'Lear "
arrived here, The Temper of the Indians in this Quarter demand the
presence of some troops, and I now assure you that unless a Respec-
table Military force is sent to this Quarter by the 1* of October that
the Indians will not move, They are now as busy in clearing land and
building their habitations as if they were never to remove—Neatha-
mala is assuming and insolent, he has threatened to drive of the White
Setlers, I must take some decided step with this Cheif—he is the
only turbulent Man in the Nation—he is creating daily more and more
dissatisfaction among the Indians he has avoided me since my Arrival
here, although he was to meet me on a Day appointed, which he prom-
ised, but failed to do—I have understood from Cap' Lear that he has
recceived Orders not to move out of St Marks, or to send any Detach-
ment Out under any pretence—I consider these Orders may prove
very injurious to the public Service for surely as I am on the Spot
something should be left to my discretion and Judgement. The Troops
should act under my Orders—or they are worse than useless at this
Point, what ever Step I take will be such as the soundest dresscretion
and Coolest and most Mature reflection would require, but if a Single
Cheif should be factious or should in a Fit of rage or Drunkeness do
mischeif I should Certainly like to send a Detachment and immeadi-
ately & Arrest him—as to using any improper severity that shall not
be permitted, If a Cheif deserves punishment I will call the other
Cheifs to try him—I regret that no Sub Agent has yet been appointed,

(private) PENSACOLA July 21* '24
SIR, In the course of our official examinations of land claims in
this District, I detected an extensive scheme to defraud the Govern-
ment out of a large quanty of land, and lots, situated at the most
eligible points for military & naval purposes in West Florida. Having
been a practising lawyer in this place previously to my appointment
to the office of Commissioner,” and from a knowledge of the people
and their language, I was enabled to trace out this attempted imposi-
tion through all its sinuosities and finally succeeded in procuring some
original papers which incontestibly prove the titles to have been
fabricated in 1820 & 1821. The number engaged in it I regret to
say, were numerous and heretofore respectable, of whom the present
Mayor of the city was the Chief personage. The detection of these
individuals has produced in them & their adherents considerable
excitement, and the odium is placed on me, as they are under the
impression that had it not been for my exertions it might have passed
undiscovered; Forgery was endeavored to be supported by Perjury
but finding that did not succeed they have even menaced me with
personal violence—I understand that some Americans here unprin-
cipled as they are and perhaps interested in the fraud, have advised
them to send forth, some petition to the President against me cal-
culated to make an unfavorable impression, if it has no other effect.
I have no hesitation in saying that individuals can be suborned here
to prove any thing that the malice of an abandoned calumniator
could invent. I have the satisfaction to know that I possess the

I have to request that should any thing of this nature be forwarded
to your office or to the President, that you will cause me to be informed
of it as early as practicable, that I may protect my character against
the assaults of seditious malcontents, who are disposed to lawless vio-
lence and unprincipled detraction; I have not heard the shadow of an
imputation against my private or official conduct, but I should not be
astonished to see myself charged with all the offences in the Decalogue,
after the gross misrepresentations of the proceedings of Judge Brack-
enridge in the Washington papers; Those publications I learn were
made on the authority of Young Scott, who is equally inimical to me,
and who sets out in a few days to Washington, to open a Pandora's
box of evils for the inspection of the government, this young man was
bound over for an attempt at assasination; was convicted of libel.
& malicious prosecution, & is now under bonds with sureties for the
peace for an assault on the Judge of the superior court, he is one of
the most vicious young men I ever knew, he is vindictive and intemper-
ate in the extreme, & not the slightest confidence can be reposed in
any thing he says; I prosecuted him, in the discharge of my profes-
sional duty for some of the offences above mentioned, & he has perse-
cuted me with the most unmitiagable rancour ever since; I consider
it due to myself to inform you of the motive for any representations
he may make; There may be some disclosure in the Treasury Depart-

point where it will intersect the “Federal Road.” I was not deceived
in the Country through which the road passes, & the expense will be
less than my Estimate. It is in general a high, dry, ridgeway & will
not only be a practicable road, but a good one, for loaded Wagons &
pleasure carriages to travel on at any season of the year. It is opened
wide enough for one carriage to travel along with room to turn out
when meeting another; and in a thinly settled, open-woods, country is
better than if openened wider because the bushes will not grow up in
it. If the Road to St. Augustine is opened only fifteen feet wide, it

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 1]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, July 29, 1824
By the 9. article of the Treaty of the 18 Sept 1823" with the
Florida Indians it was stipulated, “that should the country embraced
within the limits described in the 2" article of said treaty, upon
examination of the Indian agent and the Commissioner or Commis-
sioners to be appointed under the 8. art. of said Treaty, be by them
considered insufficient for the support of the said Indians, then the
North line as defined by the aforesaid 2" article of the said treaty,
shall be removed so far North as to embrace a sufficient quantity of
good tillable land. In pursuance of this stipulation, Col° Gadsden,
the Commissioner appointed to make the survey, was instructed “if,
In making the survey he should find that the Northern line as defined
in the Treaty does not embrace a sufficiency of good land for the
accommodation of the Indians to exercise a sound discretion and
remove it further North so as to include the necessary quantity,” ”—
The Commissioner has accordingly recommended that the North
line be extended, as laid down on the annexed map, and as the
boundary from its Eastern extremity, suggests the propriety of
adopting the Ocklewaha river to its source, and from thence in a
direction so as to close with the Eastern line agreed on in the Treaty.”
The Secretary of War has therefore the honor to submit the pro-
posed extension of the Northern and modification of the Eastern
line, as described in the annexed map, for the approbation of the
President of the United States.”

PoST ST. MARKS July 29* 1824
HON" JOHN C. CALHOUN Secretary of War
SIR I have had some difficulty with the Indians in this quarter,
They did not make an attack on our citizens, but they were extremely
insolent and made many threats, Their cheifs had in some instances
killed our cattle and hogs—they also had gone with their men to several
of our settlers and ordered them off, they threatened to drive the
people out of the country and to make war on me In short the whole
of their conduct was such, that I saw immediate hostilities must ensue
if they did not receive a timely check. The military sent to this post
not being under my command as I think they should have been, were
of no use, to me in stopping, the indians in their course.” I determined
at once to call out the few men that reside in this quarter, They came
as volunteers to the New Seat of Goverment well armed In the
meantime, I called te the cheifs and warriors of the Appalachicola to
meet me at Judge Robinsons, about 30 miles from their Towns—They
all promptly attended—and were ready to act as I might order. This
sudden movement so surprised the Tallahassee and Meckkeesuckee
Indians, that they hurried to meet me and promised to obey my
Orders and to respect my authority The chiefs were greatly allarmed,
and I think they will, be more circumspect in future—but I have but
little confidence in them, The next day I took the Interpreter with
me and went to Neamathelas Town. I found their about 300 war-
riors and I saw many of them armed—I immediately went into their
square yard—(which is their foram) and gave them a talk, and
ordered them all to meet me on the 26 Int at St. Marks, & assured them
that their ruin and distruction was cirtain unless they obeyed my
orders—On the day appointed about 600 Indians attended at this
place and I dilivered to them a talk that made considerable impression
on them, I then appointed John Hicks their head chief to lead them
south to their land, and I selected the eldest son of King Hijah, as his
chief councellor, these appointments the warriors confermed, These
chiefs are men of sense and will execute my orders—I hope now no
further difficulty will shorty occur with these people—I will take the

found in the 4 Regt. of Infty, than Capt Lear commanding this post
I flatter myself that the Goverment will recollect the value and the
services of this officer, whenever an Occasion may be presented—
I have directed the Indians to prepare to move, and to be on their
land by the 1st day of October next, at which time they will receive
their rations
The want of funds have impeded my operations but from your last
letter " I trust soon to be relieved from that difficulty, I cannot
omit to impress on you the importance of having a respectable force
in this quarter by the 15" of September next,” The indians are
restless and much dissatisfyd with the treaty, if the big swamp near
the North line was given up to them it would completely satisfy
them. The chiefs insist that they have sent men to examine the
country and that their report is, the good lands within their present
boundary is insufficent—this is in fact the only obsticle on the part
of the Indians—and as their are spanish grants (newly made I have
no doubt) that cover this swamp—perhaps it would be best to let
them have it—
I can now venture to say that the expence of carrying the treaty
into effect will not exceed my estimate transmitted to you and I hope
to make it even less, I have not heard a word from the Agent since
May last, or about the first of June " The whole trouble of attending
to the indians in this quarter & of issuing their rations has been per-
formed by me The agent is no doubt engaged in discharging his
duties about Tampa Bay—but I have been induced to mention this
from the necessity of his absence—that; I have been put to great
trouble fatigue and expence in riding over this country in order to
regulate the indians, and to make contracts for the goverment, which
are highly advantageous, and will save some thousands of Dollars
I hope that some just compensation will be allowed me, as well as
for the sums I shall have to disburse
I will repeat to you that it is important for the publick interests,
that the subagent should report to me as early as possible He will
have to repair either to St. Johns River or to Tampa Bay to attend
to the rations to be issued to the Indians"

WILLIAM SEBREE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[NA:SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, XI:ALS]
PENSACOLA W. Florida 29th July 1824.
SIR, Not long before the Term of the last Superior Court, I received
information from Washington, that my accounts as the Marshall of
this District, for Territorial expenses would not be allowed, by the
Comptroller of the Treasury—M Steele the District Attorney not-
withstanding this information, moved a rule against me to shew
cause why an attachment should not issue for not paying the Petit
Jurors of the Territory—My answer to this illegal and extraordinary
motion was filed, stating these facts, upon which the Court discharged
the rule—M Steele in the presence of a number of Individuals, who
had been previously inflamed by representations of the injustice done
them, by my refusal to pay them money to which they were not
entitled, and which I was forbidden to pay by the Accounting Officer
to whom I was responsible, publicly harrangued them, and among
other things informed them that I intended to keep the money for
speculation, and that “the Judge was a damned Scoundrel” for not
sustaining the rule against me and such has been the impression
made upon the minds of the people, that I shall find great difficulty
in procuring a Jury at the next Term of the Court, and be otherwise
embarrassed in the discharge of my official duties—M Steele has
lately become the intimate friend of M. Scott, who is the Author of
the vulgar letters you may have seen in the Eastern Papers against
the Judge and myself, which I corrected by the enclosed publica-
cations," for which I received a challenge from M. Scott, who could
only be noticed as a Blackguard, and violater of the law; having been
convicted of Libel, Malicious Prosecution, and an attempt at assasina-
tion; and being a common disturber of the Peace, I paid no attention
to the challenge—the next day I found myself posted by an out-
rageous Libel in which the name of my relation Col. Johnson of Ken-
tucky was gratuitously and thjustly unjustifiably introduced—For
these offences; I had M. Scott brought before an examining Court at
which M Steele is in the habit of attending; and even threatening the
Justices with punishment for not committing Individuals against

whom he has conceived hostility—He did not attend upon a pretext
of indisposition, which was entirely pretended, as he was out all day
after the Trial, and uncommonly boisterous at dinner—The Libel
against me was in the hand writing of an intemperate young man,”
who lives with M Steele, and whom he calls his Clerk, and was sent
forth from his Office, and I have no doubt he was the Author—when
the original Libel on which M. Scott was convicted, was produced
in Court, from the Printing Office it was found to be in M* Steele's
hand writing—It will readily occur to you, that it will be impracticable
to punish such gross offences, when the prosecuting Attorney, him-
self if not the Author, is at least the abetter to them, and under such
circumstances there is no hope of conviction—M” Steele has been
supported here, for the facility, with which he could write lampoons
on the Judge, the Commissioners, and every other Officer, who was
in the fearless, and faithful discharge of his duties; and in proportion
as his improprieties sunk him, the greater efforts were made to sus-
tain him. He has lately been suspended from the Bar, for gross and
dishonest practices in his profession, and a series of the most out-

ment of private land claims in the Territory of Florida” to pay over
to them. It is agreed that the Secretary has received from the
Treasury of the United States the sum of $1250 under the 2* Section
of the Act of Congress May 8* 1822." It is admitted that he has
received fees for recording Grants concessions &ca from the claimants
under the 4" section of the same law to a small amount far short of
$1250 at 10 cents for each hundred words for recording “said papers.”
As some doubts have arisen as to the construction of this law, it is
agreed to submit it, to the Superior Court of West Florida to be
judicially and constitutionally expounded. The Commissioners are
not to be considered as giving an Opinion that the Secretary is bound
to refund the fees by this submission.—Pensacola 25* June 1824.
Opinion
The Commissioners for settling Land Claims in West Florida vs
M. Hunter, Secretary of the Board
This is an agreed case referred by the parties to the decision of the
Superior Court on the construction of the 5* Section of the Act of
Congress of February 28* 1824 and the 4* Section of the Act of 7"
May 1822.*
The first act in the section referred to, provides that the former
Secretaries, or those who may now be Secretaries, to the Board of
Commissioners, who shall have received their salary of One Thousand
two hundred and fifty dollars, from the Treasury of the United States,
which is by law declared to be, their full compensation shall be and
they are hereby required to pay over respectively to the commissioners
conformably with the provisions of the original law, all such fees
as have been demanded and received by them, which shall be appro-
priated to defray the expenses of the Commission.”
The original law thus referred to, is the Act of 7* May 1822 before
mentioned. The only question which presents itself is whether
according to the fair construction of that law the Secretary was
entitled to the ten Cents for recording Title papers, mentioned in the
4” section, over and above the sum of $1250 as a Salary from the
Treasury? for it does not appear that any other fees have been re-
ceived by the Secretary under that law.
The construction of Statutes is not left to the arbitrary will, or
caprice of the Judge, but the law has laid down fixed and established
rules for his guide. But it is the peculiar province of the Judiciary

to interpret Laws, “6 Bac 478, and it is recognised as a sound prin-
ciple in the Courts of the United States, that the Legislature cannot
pass an Act declaring what the law is, but only what is shall be, that
such an Act as a declaratory one would not be binding on the Courts,
2 Cranch 272. In that case, the Court would not even hear an argu-
ment. The declaration of the Act, that Twelve hundred and fifty
dollars, is by law the full compensation, can only be considered as
intended to operate in future and not as declaratory of the meaning
of the present law, and if it did so could not be regarded. But it
may be said, that unless the Act of '24 be intended to compel the
Secretary to pay over the fees for recording, received by him under
the 4" section of the Act of '22 it was a superflous and useless legisla-
tion. This may be true and is so in the present instance. If the
Secretary was authorized by the Act of Congress to receive fees for
certain services rendered, he could not be deprived of them if the
services were rendered, any more than he could be deprived of any
part of his property without compensation. Such an Act would be
a monster in legislation: & we have already seen that no legislative
construction of law will bind the Judiciary The law as to what is
passed, can have no operations upon acts done under the first Act,
even if we leave out of view the expressions comformable, with the
provisions of the original law. If under the law the Commissioners
had a right to demand the fees of the Secretary there was no necessity
for a second law to enable them to do so. Does the first law authorises
the commissioners to demand the fees or any part thereof for record-
ing &c received by the Secretary when the amount does not exceed
twelve hundred and fifty dollars?
By the 2" section of the Act 22 the Commissioners are required to
appoint a well qualified Secretary, who is to record their acts and
proceedings, the claims rejected, and those admitted, with the reasons
and is to receive for his services One thousand two hundred & fifty
dollars to be paid quarterly from the Treasury. The duties assigned
by this section are those which have usually been assigned to the
Secretary of similar Boards, where the Office of Secretary was distinct
from that of recorder, and the compensation considerably less then
has been heretofore allowed for similar services. It is moreover not
made to depend on any contigencies, but is absolutely & positively
fixed to be paid from the Treasury, & this being the case as general
expressions in a subsequent part of the Act can be construed to effect
or impart the right conferred by this section if a particular thing be
given or limited in the prepart of a Statute, this shall not be taken
away or altered by any subsequent general words of the same statute
“6” Bac 481.

The fourth section of the Act provides for the recording of Grants
Patents, Concessions, Orders of Survey, & instead of creating an
Office for the purpose as have been usual on former occasions, annexed
this duty to the office of Secretary allowing him to receive from the
claimants ten cents for every hundred words the lowest compensation
hitherto allowed for this service. As this was evidently for the benefit
of the claimants (for there never was any record in this or any other
territory of such papers the Act of '24 as well as that of '22 & every
former Act of Congress establishing Boards of Commissioners provides
that the claimants shall pay for this service. And considering that
the whole expense does not exceed a dollar or two for thus having their
titles preserved in a record Book, which will remain among them,
there is nothing more just and reasonable then that they should be
subjected to it. That they should be required to record their title
papers for the information of every one is in conformity with the
policy pursued in in numerous other cases. This subjects the claim-
ants to no other expense but this which is for his own benefit, and
one which no prudent man would not incur; whatever they may pay
to Agents or Attornies to prepare their claims is entirely voluntary
of their part. That this cause is intended to provide for cases of a
distinct nature & a distinct compensation from those of the second
section, is self evident, on the simplest rules of grammatical construc-
tion. After making it the duty of the claimants to file their papers
we find these words “which shall be recorded by the Secretary, and
who for his said services shall be entitled to demand from the claim-
ants ten cents for each hundred words contained in said papers so
recorded he shall be entitled to receive, twenty five cents for each
sub-poena issued,” Then follows the proviso which shall be noticed
presently. It is very clear that nothing in this section thus far has
any relation to what is contained in the second section. The services
to be performed are of a different kind to be paid in a different way.
For recording the Acts of the Board, their opinion of different claims,
for translating such papers as they may require to be translated, the
claimants are not required to pay anything & there could be no way of
estimating those services by the hundred words The proviso which
follows is clearly confined to the matters contained in this section,
provided that if the amount so received shall exceed One Thousand
two hundred &fifty Dollars, which is hereby declared the compensation
for his services, the excess shall be reported to the Commissioners and
shall be subject to their disposition.” If after the word his in the last
line, the word said have been introduced, or a different sum from that
in the second section had been mentioned, there would not have been
a “loop to hang a doubt upon” but as it is a doubt can only exist in the

mind of the most shallow sciolist of the law. The first part of this
proviso evidently refers to the matters which immediately proceed,
and the subsequent part is in gramatical order insaparably con-
nected with that number of the sentence. But the subject is sus-
ceptible of still clearer demonstration of the soundest principles of law.
We have already seen that a thing which has been given by a pre-
vious part of the statute cannot be taken away by general words in a
subsequent parts it is also a rule that if the “literal expressions of the
law would lead to absurd, unjust or inconvenient consequences, such
construction should be given as to avoid such consequences, if from the
whole purview and giving effect to words used, it may be fairly done.”
If then the Proviso refers to the second section as well as to the matter
contained in the fourth, and that instead of two sums of $1250 there
is but one identical sum contemplated by both sections it will follow
that two ways are provided for the payment of it, to the Secretary,
first out of the Treasury of the United States, and next by fees to be
received from the claimants. What would be the partical
operation? the Secretary draws his salary quarterly from the
Treasury, is not made to depend on any contigency, he is paid at the
end of each quarter, without any inquiery about his fees, and in the
meantime may have received a like amount in fees. What becomes of
the amount received in the way last mentioned? He is only to ac-
count to the commissioners for the excess, and if no excess the law
does not require him to account for it any where. The word excess
cannot by the most forced construction be made to apply to any
thing but the fees received. The expression “which is hereby de-
clared the compensation for his services” are to be read as a paren-
thesis, the sence then will be “that if the amount so received &"—
shall exceed $1250 the excess shall be reported to the commissioners.
Can this mean the excess of the $1250 to be paid from the Treasury?
If any reference had been intended it would have been provided that
the Secretary should account for all the fees received. Where the
necessity of reporting the excess? The Secretary might be required to
report the fees received by him, his salary being fixed any thing
received beyond that sum must have been excess Was it intended to
give him the option of being paid directly from the Treasury or to
depend on the contigency of fees? The idia is too absurd. If the
sum to be paid from the Treasury had been less than $1250 there
might be reason to contend that the allowance of fees was intended to
make up that sum as a full compensation, although such would not
be a sound construction even in that case without falling into evident
absurdity and inconvenience. Can any other construction be given
to the 2" and 4" sections of the Act of “22" then it was intended to

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 31
allow two distinct sums of $1250 each to be paid in a different manner
for services of a different nature?
When we examine the Acts of Congress in pari materia and consider
whether the compensation allowed to this construction be reasonable
or otherwise, the intention of the Legislature will be still more clearly
manifested. There have been many boards of Commissioners in the
different territories established for the same purpose as that of West
Florida under circumstances precisely similar. Let us see what has
been the compensation allowed for like services. It may first be
proper to remark that in every instance during twenty years legisla-
ture on the same subject, the claimants have been required to pay for
recording their papers, and in every instance more than in West
Florida. In the land District of Vincennes, Kaskaskia, and Detroit
the claimants were required to pay to the Register of the land Office
12% Cents for each hundred words for recording their titles, and in
addition to this he received his regular salary from the Treasury of
the United States and both in conjunction formed his compensation
in all the Boards organised subsequent to the foregoing the same pro-
visions were made for the recording officer, of payments from both the
Treasury and the claimants. By the Acts of Congress of the 2"
March 1805" establishing boards in the Territories of Louisiana and
Orleans a Register was appointed a salary of Fifteen Hundred dollars
and fees for recording to be paid by the claimants at the rate of 12%
cents for every hundred words. The whole amount thus received for
fees went to the Register instead of being limited to any particular
sum. There was moreover a Clerk to the Board who received a stated
salary to be paid our of the Treasury of two Thousand dollars and
whose duties were similar to those of the Secretary of this Board. A
translator was also allowed, with a salary of six hundred dollars &
fees which duty is also imposed upon the secretaries of the commis-
sioners in Florida without any additional compensation. Here are
upwards of Four thousand dollars paid out of the Treasury for services,
for which in Florida only Twelve hundred and fifty dollars are allowed,
and besides in the former cases, the sum which might be received for
fees was not limited to any particular amount This compensation
was continued with very little variation in amount until the Com-
mission closed in 1809. By the Act 25" April 1812 " two commis-
sioners were appointed to adjust the land claim in two Districts of
Louisiana East and West of Pearl River who were allowed a salary of
$1500 each, and were required to hold their offices at different places
they were allowed each a Clerk who received One Thousand dollars

from the Treasury and was permitted to demand fees for recording
at the rate of 12% cents for every hundred words without any limita-
tion. For each of these boards therefore the sum of Two thousand
dollars was allowed for the Services of Clerks besides fees. In the
District East of Pearl River or Jackson court House by an Act passed
3 march 1819 " the Register was allowed two thousand dollars a year
ex-officio commissioner and a Clerk was appointed with a salary of
twelve hundred dollars from the Treasury and besides 12% cents from
the claimants as his compensation for recording the papers of the
claimants, without being limited to any particular amount.” By an
Act of Congress passed at the present session relating to the adjust-
ment of Land titles at St Helena and Jackson Court House, the
Register and Receiver is allowed a salary of One Thousand Dollars
from the Treasury and a Clerk who shall be a person capable of Trans-
lating the French and Spanish Language is allowed twelve hundred
and fifty dollars.”
It thus appear that the compensation allowed to the Secretary of the
Board in Florida, even according to the construction which has been
put on the same is lower then has ever been hitherto allowed for sim-
ilar services. According to a different construction the compensation
would be manifestly in adequate. The most laborious part of his duty
that of recording the land titles must be continued without interrup-
tion while he is attending on the board, and the fees being very low,
they are scarcely sufficient to pay an assistant whose services are in-
dispensable. The whole amount received for recording fall far short
of the sum of twelve hundred and fifty dollars. The duty of Recorder
and Translator were assigned to the Secretary evidently for the sake
of creating fewer Officers as well as for the purpose of economy, but
it is equally clear that it was intended to enable the Secretary to em-
ploy assistants for whose Acts he should be responsible. In all the
laws referred to, the Clerk has been allowed fees for recording, over
and above his salary from the Treasury, and in every instance he was
probably compelled to employ an assistant. If but one sum of $1250
be allowed in Florida, the Secretary must pay one half of it for that
purpose, thus rendering his compensation entirely inadequate and out
of all reason compared to what has been usually allowed as well as
from the nature of the Service performed. According to the law last
referred to, the Clerk is allowed the same sum which is allowed in the
second section of the Act under consideration but he is allowed nothing
more, for the very obvious reason that there was nothing but the Acts
71 3 STAT. 528–532.
* The act in question stipulated $1500 for the register and $1000 for the clerk.

of the Register, to record the title papers Grants &c having been al-
ready filed and recorded. The duties were precisely similar to those
assigned to the Secretary under the the second section just mentioned.
Upon the whole I am clearly of Opinion that the Commissioners are
only entitled to an account of the fees received by the Secretary under
the 4* Section when the amount exceeds $1250 and that any sum
under that amount was intended as a compensation to the Secretary
for the recording the title papers of the claimants. Any other con-
struction would be manifestly unjust and would be entirely at variance
with what has heretofore been considered a reasonable compensation
by Congress for similar services. It would be to require him to dis-
charge the accumulated duties of three Offices of Secretary, Recorder
and Translator, for a less sum than has been heretofore allowed to
each of them.

DEAR SIR I am under the painful necessity of announcing to
you the death of the Hon” William W. Blair one of the land Com-

And I regret to say that from the continued illness of Judge Blair
we have not been able to make that progress in the duties of the
Commission as I fear the Government will expect—from the com-
mencement of the Commission we have had little or no assistance
from Colonel Hamilton, and his successor as yet, has not been here;
should he come on shortly, or a successor be appointed to fill Judge
Blairs vacancy, I yet flatter myself that we will be able to adjudicate
on and report all the cases which can possibly be prepared by our
Secretary in the time alloted us—And I am sorry that the immense
duty of translating voluminous documents, recording them, and
after all copying them in the form of a report seems not to have been
properly considered by the framers of the Law—We are by the late
Law authorized to act on Office abstracts; this is not so great a facility
as it may have been considered—the best translators inform us,
that there is little difference in making copies, and correct abstracts—

of Platting & calculating, having been transfered to my office: and in
making contracts I am to exercise a sound discretion having regard to
the difficulties which may present themselves in the section of Country
Contracted for—During & subsequent to the Seminole Campaign, I
had an opportunity of seeing much of the country above the Cape in
both the Floridas, and I have no hesitation in saying; that much
greater difficulties are presented to the Surveyors in that quarter than
the State of Alabama afforded, and I am informed that the Maximum
has been uniformly given in that Department. The Poor Lands of
Florida are generally covered with the Saw Palmetto which is destruc-
tive to Horses and difficult to the passage of Footmen, and inter-
spersed occasionally with Bay Galls or swamps, thickly covered with
the Bay and other timber.
When I consider the face of the Country generally, as well from
personal Knowledge, as information derived from others, I am free
to Acknowledge that the Maximum given, will insure its Survey
throughout, otherwise I am persuaded that Legislative provision will
have to be made extending the limit for the Survey of the rich Ham-
mock Land on the Lakes, Bays, Inlets & water courses-

These ideas are given you, with a hope that you will remove the
restriction placed upon me as first set forth in this letter, believing as I
do, that it will be difficult to procure and retain good Surveyors
for less than the Maximum in that climate—
Your Circular D. requires estimates for the present year only—You
have instructed the Survey of 20 Townships; but I infer a propriety
in sending you inclosed an estimate for the succeeding year to call for
Appropriation—In making this estimate, it is predicated upon the fact,
that the number of Surveyors which I shall employ immediately; can,
after having completed the Townships already required; survey the
proposed Amount by the last day of April 1825, which I deem the
latest period practicable to Survey in that climate with its attendant
evils—The 1* of Nov. in each year I consider the proper period of
commencement; affording six months for field operations—To survey
in any part of the residue, I would deem it destructive of Human &
Animal life; should you therefore determine on a larger estimate,
please notify me in time, to enable me to have it executed in the period
above suggested-I presume you intend, that I shall exercise my own
discretion as to the particular location of the 20 Townships immedi-
ately required in the vicinity of the Seat of Government—
I have not yet received the Laws, and am desirous of perfectly
understanding the office regulations growing out of them, and there-
fore beg leave to ask for information on the following subjects not

[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS]
ST. AUGUSTINE 12 August 1824.
HON THE SECRETARY OF STATE,
I regret the necessity I am under in troubling you so often with
respect to my claim on the Department for adv. the Laws of the
Territory. This service has been performed since October last;
when I transmitted my a/c in blank" but received no answer. I
wrote repeatedly after that," and in June last I received a letter
from Mr. W. Browne saying that if I would forward a pamphlet
copy of the laws the money would be forwarded.” Not being able
to procure a copy (the work being printed at Pensacola, and being
put in the hands of a few public officers only) I therefore called on the
Judge of the Superior Court who certified the no. of pages which was
contained in the printed copy, and again transmitted my a/c in
blank,” but have not since then received any information from it.
I regret very much, not to have been able to send on a printed copy
of the laws, and hope that my inability to do so will be received as an
excuse. I thought that the certificate would have been sufficient,
but if the money is detained on this account, I beg to referr [MS.
torn] to the a/cs of Messrs. Fitzgerald & Co. of West Florida already
in the Department, and which were paid in Jan or Feb. last, where
the precise amount will be ascertained."
I hope, Sir, you will pardon my importunity on subject, as the
small amount due me will be of the most essential service to me, and
necessary to meet a debt due my agent in Charleston since the time
I first transmitted my alc. St. Augustine is at present labouring
under severe pecuniary embarrassment, from various causes, but
which the people are taught by the disaffected, to attribute to the
general Government, and many of the Spaniards have been thus oper-
ated upon to abandon it, and are making arrangements to move
away. A republican by birth and education, I have of choice, both
publicly and privately defended the administration from unjust
imputations—have endeavoured, so far as my situation in life would
enable me to do it, to inculcate peace and good order, and a love for
the institutions of my country; and the better to do this I have kept
out of view the great questions which engage the attentions of the

I beg leave also to draw your attention to the situation of Land
titles here. The people have been unceasing in their complaints
since the organization of the Board. Many of the people look to the
sale of their lands for the support of their families, being destitute of
every other resource—and their complaints are also loud with re-
spect to the absence of Mr Worthington, who, we are informed, will
not be here till November. There is no possibility of disposing of
lands until the Board has passed upon and adjusted the titles.
I hope, sir, that you will pardon me for these hints, being assured
that you will receive them kindly. With a desire to promote the
public welfare I subscribe myself Yours &c."

Department of State WASHINGTON 17 Aug. 1824.
TO DAVIS FLOYD, GEORGE MURRAY & W. H. ALLEN, Commissioners
of land titles in East Florida, at St. Augustine
GENTLEMEN I have the honour to enclose, herewith, two public
Documents submitted to the House of Representatives of the United
States at their last Session, and printed by their order.
1. A Letter from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Chairman of
the Committee on public lands,” transmitting a report from Mess’rs
Floyd and Blair," with enclosures, relating to land claims in Florida.
2. A message from the President of the United States, to the House
of Representatives” transmitting a Report of Alexander Hamilton,
and sundry papers relating to the same claims.”
The Report of the Committee on the public lands, to whom this
message of the President, with Mr. Hamiltons Report was refered,
will particularly require your attention; and you will observe, it
concludes with two Resolutions which were adopted by the House,”
and by one of which the President is requested to cause to be prepared
and transmitted to the Commissioners, such instructions touching
their powers and the performance of their duties under the existing
laws, as he may deem necessary, from an examination of the Report of
Mr. Hamilton, and from that of the other two Commissioners for
East Florida.
The instructions to be given under the said Resolutions will be

of their duties, the Commissioners will be peculiarly cautious in guard-

be attempted to be practiced for obtaining the confirmation of
spurious, forged and unlawful grants. He is fully convinced that
neither the Governors General of Cuba, nor the Governors or com-

no case, recommend the confirmation of any claim exceeding in amount
the quantity which the Governors were authorised by the general

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR DUVAL
[NA: OIA Lets. Sent, Bk. 1 *]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, August 17* 1824.
To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, S." Marks.
SIR, I have received your letters of the 12" Ultimo,” accompanied by
the expense of the Rations to be furnished to the emigrant Indians in
Florida, according to the late treaty. The estimate for the rations
exceeds the appropriation. But the expense on that account must
by no means be permitted to exceed the sum appropriated by Con-
gress. I am decidedly of the impression that sum will be found
sufficient, as I cannot doubt from all I can learn that the estimate
of the number of Indians in Florida is greatly exaggerated, and must
believe that the meat and bread part of the ration will not cost 12%
cts, as you have estimated—a price exceeding the average rate of
the complete ration throughout the U. States. With those im-

pressions, and the fact that children will receive but half rations, I
cannot doubt but that the sum appropriated will be found to be ample.
I have, however entire confidence in your judgment and zeal to serve
the public, and that you will take such measures as to conduct the
concentration of the Indians in Florida, as will be most effectual and
economical.
A requisition will issue as requested by you for $13,500—(thirteen
thousand five hundred dollars) that is to say Six thousand as provided
for by the 3"Article of the Treaty; Five thousand as provided for by
the 3” Article, 2000$ as provided for by the 5" article, and five
hundred being the balance due under the 6* Article. This sum will be
placed to your credit in the bank of New Orleans.
You state that you have paid to Neamalatha 500$ under the Treaty.
On enquiring of the agent I understood from him verbally, that the
same amount had been expended, by his direction to purchase Cattle
at the request of this Chief. I directed the agent to make a report of
this case, which however, he has neglected. I fear there will be some
embarrassment in the disbursement, as the appropriation provides
only for five hundred dollars, and it will be impossible that both of
you can receive a credit. This subject ought to be immediately
attended to.
I cannot believe that the Indians can be so infatuated as to make
any decided objection to the removal, and that the hostile disposition
which they now shew is intended to produce some relaxation in the
terms of the Treaty, but when they find the Government is resolved
to carry its provisions into effect they will acquiesce without trouble,
particularly as they are eminently beneficial to the Indians. It will
be impossible to augment the number of Troops now in Florida,
unless it should become necessary to apply force to a much greater
extent than I now anticipate. The Officer commanding at S*Marks
has received instructions to consult with you and to act under your
directions.
Your Drafts in favor of Col° Nesbit for one thousand dollars has
been paid. The accounts and estimates of the agent will be rendered
through you, and will be specifically approved by you. Puntuality
in their rendition will be required. You are authorized to appoint a
Sub-agent for One year at five hundred dollars per annum, payable
quarter-yearly. You will report his appointment to the Department
for confirmation. It is believed the services of a Sub-agent will not
be required after the Indians shall have been concentrated on their
reservation. The agent has rendered a statement of his account
by which it appears he has advanced under your orders on a contract
made by you with M' Chairs the sum of three thousand dollars.

It is proper you should be apprized that under existing laws, no ad-
vances should be made, and that neither yourself, nor the agent can
obtain payment for the sum advanced 'til the Cattle are delivered
under the contract, and receipted for."
I have the honor &c. &c.

information respecting the contractual issue with Benjamin Chaires for supplying
rations to the Indians. A copy of the contract was enclosed and is printed ibid., pp.
622-623. “The Indians in this quarter have some violent quarrels among them-
selves; and, lately, two towns fought with clubs and knives, and several of them
are maimed and severely beaten. I have interposed my authority to prevent
open and deadly war among them and expect to make them settle their dispute,
and abide by the opinion of their steady old chiefs. Between the settlers and the
Indians I have been constantly engaged in preserving order, whenever my health
would permit. The duties which I have performed, and the exposure to the hot
sun and rain in a wilderness such as this, have seriously injured my constitution.
I have, for several weeks, been wholly unable to quit my cabin, and much of the
time confined to my bed. I mention this as my apology for not writing more
fully to you on the subject of the contracts I have made. . . . The want of the
services of the agent, or any one to assist me, has imposed heavy duties on me,
and engrossed the whole of my time. The $6,000 which, by the treaty, was to be
laid out in purchase of stock, cattle, &c, as well as the $1,000 for a gunsmith and
his tools, $2,000 for transportation, and the $4,500 to be given for compensation
for Indian improvements, will be wanted as early as possible; the $6,000 for the
purchase of stock cattle is not a part of the annuity, as I understand the treaty.
It will be enough to remit the annuity some time hence.” This letter was

a routine report relative to the construction of Cant. Brooke. The concluding
paragraph respecting roads is of interest. “I observe that Congress, during its
last session, has directed a survey of a road, from Tampa Bay to intersect, the
road, from Pensacola, to St. Augustine; and the survey of roads from Cape Sable
and Florida Point. These two latter roads, can never be of any service, as they
probably will not be travelled, and will require every two, or three years to be cut
out anew. I would also observe, that 16 feet, is sufficiently wide for any road,
and that making it 25, is a vast increase of labor, added to, a disadvantage. I
shall do myself the honor, to write you upon this subject, more fully in a few days.”

SIR, You must have misapprehended my letter of the 8" ultimo,"

in that letter that I had very lately succeeded in collecting some money
which I was disposed to appropiate to the payment of a note given by
Shomo,” to the late Marshal pro tem whose estate was insolvent,
knowing that the note was given to him for a debt due to the U States;
under these circumstances I was not a little surprized at your unquali-
fied declaration that the money “ought long since to have been de-
posited in Bank” It perhaps ought to have been there deposited by
Shomo but not me, for I had it not to deposit, & had it not been for
my uncommon exertions not one cent would have been saved—I was

S‘AUGUSTINE August 24" 1824
SIR, Through the politeness of Waters Smith Esq" Marshal of this
District, I have for the first time, had an opportunity of reading M"
Hamiltons report, of the 18 of May 1824,” and altho’ I feel neither
the wish now to enter into any explanation, or vindication of the
opinions heretofore given, nor to cherish the Spirit of recrimination,
yet there are some inferences, and inuendoes, which require explana-
tion;—and here I must state, on my first arrival on the 17" of July
1823, an entire stranger to the laws, and regulations of the former
Spanish Authorities, as well as the inhabitants of the province, and
the Laws and Regulations of the Territorial Gov' of Florida; in one
of my first interviews with Mr Hamilton he remarked that the papers
and documents relative to land Claims, were in the possession of a
person in the City, and that it was indispensable, that we should have
the possession of them; and that unless we obtained an order from the
Government, for the delivery of them to us, that we should find some
difficulty in procuring them; at the same time asking me if I would
unite, in a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury (if I mistake not)
asking such order—I unhesitatingly answered in the affirmative,
without enquiring into the manner in which they had been placed
in the hands of that person, or even the Law authorizing us to have
access to them at all times through our Secretary, relying on the state-
ment of M" H–, and that the course was correct. I jointly signed the

letter alluded to, and from a reference to it, it will appear that it
bears date between the 17" of July, & the 1* August 1823.” This
subject was never again brought before the Board in my presence,
until after my arrival with my family, about the first of November.
I learned that some misunderstanding had taken place, between M*
Blair, and M. Hamilton, with regard to the propriety of carrying
into effect the order from the Department of State, as it would have
a tendency, to destroy a public Office, established by the Legislative
Council,” & sanctioned by Congress; and furthermore, that it would
have thrown into the hands, and custody of our Secretary, a mass of
papers, for the examination, and arrangement of which, his whole
time would have been necessary: And although under the circumstances
above named, I had united in the letter which produced that order,
I felt myself bound, to unite with M. Blair in opposing the measures,
so ardently pursued by M Hamilton to procure the possession of
those papers:—this matter has heretofore been laid before the proper
Department, and should not now, have been again stirred, only for
the purpose of accounting for the apparent inconsistancy in first
writing the letter, and then opposing the execution of the order—That
M” Hamilton has been more fortunate than the other commissioners,
in procuring papers, purporting to be Official correspondance, and
Royal Orders, will appear from the two reports:—We obtained papers,
& documents, and papers as authentic, alone from the Office of the
Keeper of the public Archives; how M* Hamilton obtained those, we
know not, nor do we apprehend any serious loss to the United States,
should the opinion of a Majority of the Board, tho' conscientiously
given, prove to be erroneous:—As to the powers invested in Gov'
Quesada,” as but few grants were made by him, and those only for
small quantities of Land—I beg leave further to state, that so par-
ticular have we been in taking every probable means in our power,
by directing the United States Att to devote most of his time, in
examining the titles, comparing, and investigating the facts, so as to
impeach those, which may be considered suspicious, that we have
feared least the government should think that we were unnecessarily
demanding services of that Officer,-we would be glad to be instructed
on this subject. Another subject which I cannot forbear naming;
M” Hamilton, named to me, as well as to other Gentlemen of this place,
that he either had, or knew evidence which would shew a grant to
F. M. Arredondo for 50.000 acres a fraudulent One. This case has
been held under advisement since last winter, for the purpose of

W" HENRY ALLEN Esq Commissioner for adjusting claims to Lands

SIR, In consequence of the conversation which I had the pleasure
to have with you yesterday, I now enclose a memorandum of the
Classification which I think it advisable that the Commissioners should
adopt in making their Reports to the Secretary of the Treasury,
accompanied by form marked A, which will be common to all the
Reports from N° 1 to N° 11 inclusive—The form marked B, will be
used for the Reports from N° 12 to N° 14 inclusive—Where it is not
necessary to fill up the Columns in the form A, or where from want of
information it cannot be done, they will be left vacant—In the column
left for that purpose such remarks may be made as the peculiarity of
each particular claim may make necessary or proper. Each Report
should be closed by such general remarks as the Commissioners may
deem proper in relation to each class of claim & should be signed by
them or a majority of them, Should any one of the Commissioners
dissent from the majority, he may assign his reasons for so doing on
the Report, or in a seperate protest—These reports should all be made
on paper of the same size & in such manner as to allow of their being
bound together, and the Commissioners ought to keep duplicates of
them in their office. The Classification of the Reports may be
extended, in any manner that the Commissioners may deem necessary,
& I would recommend for the reasons stated to you personally, that a
seperate report be made of all the cases recommended for confirmation

COMMISSION OF AUGUSTUS B. WOODWARD 20 AS JUDGE
[NA:SD, Temp. Comms. Pres.]
[August 26, 1824]
JAMES MONROE, President of the United States of America.
To all who shall see these presents, Greeting:
Know Ye, That in pursuance of the Act of Congress passed on the
twenty Sixth day of May 1824; entitled An Act to amend an Act,
entitled “An Act to amend an Act for the establishment of a Terri-
torial Government in Florida, and for other purposes,”” and reposing
special Trust and Confidence in the Wisdom, Uprightness and Learning
of AUGUSTUS B. WOODWARD, I do appoint him Judge for that part of
the Territory situated between the Apalachicola and Suwannee river;
* Augustus Brevoort Woodward (1774–1827), a native of New York City, was
graduated from Columbia College in 1793. After short residences in Philadelphia
and western Virginia, Woodward established himself in Georgetown and then at
Alexandria in the District of Columbia, engaging in the practice of law, real estate
speculation, and writing on political philosophy. Following his appointment as a
Federal Judge in Michigan Territory in 1805, he moved to Detroit and served there
in that position, except for a period during the War of 1812, until 1824. He was
not nominated for reappointment as a Judge in Michigan Territory because false
charges touching his character had been presented to the President, but his friends
came to his aid, and amends were made by giving him the judgeship in Florida.
Judge Woodward reached Tallahassee in Oct. 1824, returned to Washington and
Detroit early in 1825 to settle his affairs, and took up permanent residence in
Florida in that year. He died in Tallahassee June 12, 1827. See Frank B. Wood-
ford, Mr. Jefferson's Disciple, A Life of Justice Woodward (East Lansing, 1953),

The undersigned inhabitants of East Florida deeply lamenting the
recent unfortunate death of the Hon” Will" W. Blair, Judge of the
third Judicial District of the Territory, and anxiously desirous of
seeing the vacancy thus occasioned on the Supreme Bench supplied
by a gentleman of approved worth, talents and legal acquirements,
and trusting that the choice will be made from the residents of the
Country rather than from amongst Strangers, do unite in recommend-
ing our fellow Citizen Isaac Newton Cox as a proper person to fill the
Office above referred to; and feel ourselves authorized to state that
his appointment would afford general satisfaction to the people of
this Section of the Territory, and would be considered by them as a
mark of attention to their wishes, on the part of the Executive of

GENERAL LAND OFFICE August 28* 1824
CO ROB" BUTLER, Fountane of Health Tennessee
SIR, Your letter of the 5* Ins' * is received. My instructions are
explicit on the subject of Contracts for the Surveying of the Public
Lands, they authorise you if necessary to give the maximum price,
but intimate an opinion that the surveying may be executed for some-
thing less than the maximum price—This intimation was admonitory,
& in some measure founded on a belief that it was the general prac-
tice of Surveyors General to cause the Township plats to be made
out by the Deputies, I understand however from Gen' Coffee * that
such has not been the practice in his office. Your estimate for the
surveying to be executed in 1825, is as large a one as will be sub-
mitted to Congress. It is probable that it will be expedient to sur-
vey within that year the exterior lines of a greater number of Town-
ships than you mention, but it will not be necessary to subdivide that
number, as I presume you will not find as many Townships of good
land, which are not interfered with by private claims, I see no prospect
of getting any of the private claims surveyed sooner than November
1825. Office Rent, Furniture & fuel are not allowed as contingent
expences, the necessary printing is allowed, & instruments &C for sur-
veying & drawing—You will percieve from the law that there has
been an omission to allow Clerk hire, and also an omission to make
an appropriation for your Salary—the latter will however be paid
out of the contingent appropriation for the Treasury Department.
As to the Clerk hire there can be no doubt that Congress will when
they act on the subject allow to you the same amount for Clerk hire
which is allowed by Law to Gen' Coffee. In the mean time you will
on opening your office employ one Clerk, untill the Surveyors return
their field notes when you may possibly find it necessary to employ
two Clerks. You will advise this office of the names of the person
or persons so employed & the amount of the Salary the accounts for
which will be included in your quarterly salary accounts—It will be

necessary for you to procure a standard Chain & Compass—The
standard Chain should be made in conformity, to that in the posses-
sion of M" Geo Davis at Washington, Mississippi or that in possession
of Gen' Coffee. You will establish a correct Meridian line at or near
your office, by which all the Compasses used in Surveying will be
regulated, & all lines will be run agreeably to the true Meridian, all
the instruments for taking the necessary observations for establishing
the Latitude & Longitude of any place, were formerly purchased by
M Biggs * & left with the Surveyor General at Washington, you will
correspond with M. Davis on this subject, & when the instruments
are required by you I will instruct M. Davis to have them forwarded
to any person you may authorise to recieve them at New Orleans—
They will probably require cleaning & repairing. A volume of the
Land Laws and the Laws of the last Session have been forwarded to
you,” I now send the 6* Volume of the Laws of the United States,

SIR. Considering you as the chosen guardian of the Rights of all
American citizen, I do not shrink from addressing you on the present
occasion, though I premise that I am the last person who would be
anxious on Evry Occurrence to intrude myself on you. But now I
am so assured that there is none but you, to whom I can apply with
any prospect of redress for the injury and outrage that have lately
been committed on my person, that I am confident that I should be
wanting to myself and doing injustice to the Laws of my Country
were I not to complain The simple narration of my grievances will
suffice to explain the cause and motive of my complaint, and be
sufficient to interest you so far as to require a more full examination
into the case—
A few weeks ago Judge Smith of this city came into a Room where
there was a Billiard Table of which I was at that time the Keeper,
and commenced playing with one Gomez;" this was Early in the day
of Saturday the 7" Inst. and continued at the game till late at night
Throught the games it was evident to all bystanders that Judge Smith's
conduct was very unfair though no one spoke so long as his opponent
did not complain In the mean time his Honor became very noisey and
boisterous and betrayed evry excess of an ungovernable temper which
from regard to his Office and dread of his strength passed unresented
till about Ten O’clock at night he (Judge Smith) played evidently so
unfair that I enquired whether I should notice some advantage and
success he claimed, when Judge Smith demanded whether there were
any foul Strokes at the Table I told him there were, to which he in a

most insulting and abusive maner replyed by calling me a damned fool
and said where are your Rules. I told him we had none but General
Rules, he repeated you are fool—a damned Liar—and a damned Villain
and scounderall and became so Enraged at being detected in Cheating
(not very uncommon as many of his associates in this City will
Swear.) That he seized, and as I supposed intended to choak me which
induced me to endeavour to repulse him; at which he took a large
Stick that was near and beat me in the most unmerciful maner. I
made several attempts to escape and beged him for Gods Sake to
desist as he was murdering me which I solemly beleive he would have
done; had not M. Edgar Macon the Attorney General (who keeps his
Office and Sleeps near the Room where the scene took place) been
brought by the noise to the Spot at whose presence Smith desisted.
For several days after this I was confined to my bed and had to be
attended by a Surgeon who declared as his opinion that my cheek
bones had been broken.
My circumstances in life are humble, and I have been unfortunate;
but it is in the power of no One, to say any thing that implicates my
character. I have the Honor to be known by the Secretary of War,
and he can vouch for the statement I have last made, could I procure
redress at Law I would not trouble you but the Territorial Judicial
System is so defective that it cannot be had indead if I am not very
much mistaken Judge Smith boasts that he is above the Law or at
least that it cannot reach him, a truth which we are implled to admit,
since we have seen several attacked for contempt of Court who dared
to complain and the prosecuting Attorney threatened with imprison-
ment for suffering witnesses to be sworn to give evidence to the Grand
Jury, for assaults and batteries committed by his Honor I do not
appeal to your excellency with the foolish Expectation that any thing
will be done hastily on your part, but as an American I demand that I
shall be heard I also beg that you will take into consideration the
Effect Judge Smiths example will have on this community (who are
already exclaiming against the American Officers;) if it should go
unpunished should you not think the depositions I herewith forward
you sufficient to justify an enquirey in the case I beg you will call on
M” Macon the U.S. Attorney The information he will give for he
witnessed the conclusion of the Transaction will satisfy you that the
case merits a full investigation This I ask and pray you will give
Before I conclude I will remind you that a complaint similar to this
was made last winter to Congress but which was never acted on It
is true that the Grand Jury of the last Superior Court, did vindicate
Judge Smith, but it disgusted evry honest gentleman of the community

GENERAL LAND OFFICE, 31st August. 1824.
COL” ROBERT BUTLER Sur. Gen. of Florida.—
SIR. An act having passed on the 24th May last changing the
mode of surveying the Public Lands on any river, lake, or water
course,” you are hereby authorized, to depart from the ordinary mode
of surveying Lands adjoining Lakes or Water Courses, whenever in
your opinion the situation of the lands, the accommodation of settlers,
or the interest of the Government, may make it expedient, and Survey
the same in conformity to the provisions of the Act above referred to.
It will in many situations be impracticable to survey the lands in
strict conformity to the provisions of this Act, in respect to the pre-
scribed front and depth, but there must be as near an approximation,
to the rule prescribed as the localities will permit.
In executing the Surveys under the provisions of this Act, I would
recommend that the traverses of the water courses, within the limits
of any Township or fractional township, be accurately taken and
platted down, that an experimental line be laid down as nearly
parallel to the meanders of the water course as circumstances may
make expedient, and at a distance which shall generally be equal to
40 acres in depth from the water course—the space thus formed will
then be divided into lots which shall as near as practicable have a

Levoritt H. Coe, and Alfred Guthrie. See also ante, p. 39. These letters were the
beginning of a lengthy documentation relative to the conduct of Judge Smith. Coe
wrote the Secretary of War again on Dec. 21, 1824, enquiring about the receipt of
the documents he had sent to Washington and what action could be expected in the

front equal to two acres, and be forty acres in depth, this plat will be
transferred to the ground by running the necessary lines and marking
the corners and bearing trees.
The corners on the water course & the back corners of each lot
should be well marked—I should not think it necessary to run & mark
more than the divisional lines, of every eighth lot, which would be the
line of the Section or Fractional Section, and which on the Township
plat should be coloured black, the division lines of the lots in each
section, or fractional section may be coloured in Red ink.
I enclose for your information the copy of two township plats of
Land on the Mississippi which have been surveyed in pursuance to the
provisions of the 5* Section, of the Act of 1812." The front lots in
this plat contain about 160 acres and the mode of numbering the lots
and sections has been approved. As the lots to be surveyed agreeably
to the act of the 24" of May 1824. will contain about 80 acres only—
I suggest the propriety of numbering them agreeably to the enclosed
diagram, marked A.
Some discretion must be exercised by the Deputy Surveyor in laying
down the line parrellel to the Water Course—acute bends on the river
will necessarily form fractional lots of very irregular forms and vary-
ing from the prescribed front and depth.
I presume that there is a considerable portion of the lands in your
District and particularly in East Florida lying on the seaboard, bays,
Lakes, and water Courses which it may be deemed expedient to survey
agreeably to this mode. You will probably also it find it expedient
to apply this mode of surveying to any small spaces lying between
Private surveys bounded by water courses."—

engaged in preparing for their transportation, and urging them to
dispose of their Corn and other crops which they cannot take with
them, I find they are all buisely engaged in gathering their crops and
many of them have already sold their corn. As it is contemplated
to open a road from Pensacola to S' Augustine, if the troops are
sent to this point they can at once commence working on the road

HON" JOHN C. CALHOUN Secretary at War
I have the honor to inform you that last evening John Bellamy

and has desired me to inform you that he will undertake to make a
good road from Pensacola to S' Augustine under the direction of per-
son you may appoint for 23,000 Dolls the sum appropriated by law
for this object, and he will give ample security to complete the work
in one year. An advance only of $5,000 will be required by him.
M” Bellamy is a man of wealth enterprise and of strict honesty, if
he makes any contract it will be fulfilled to your satisfaction. This
gentleman has a number of slaves and could do the work principally
with his own force I believe it would be greately to the interest of the
United States to make such a contract it would save much expence
and leave the military force to be used for other objects. I do not
know whether the President of the United States is vested with power
by the act of Congress to make such a contract, but if he is he will
no doubt do so.
M” Bellamy resides in Florida and has a settlement near the Mick
Kee Sukkee Towns. I know him intimately and do not hesitate to
recommend him as a man who may be confidently relyed on.”

to make a contract (NA, WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk, 12). See post, p. 82.

* The Secretary of War appointed Gadsden as commissioner to value the
improvements in question on Sept. 11, 1824 (NA,OIA, SW Lets. Sent, Bk. 1),
but he declined, and Bellamy accepted (post, p. 89). Neither the original nor a

his account (post, p. 101), and from the schedule of payments made to the towns
and their chiefs (post, p. 102). In McKenney to the Secretary of War, Dec. 2,
1824 (NA, loc. cit.), a requisition for DuVal in the sum of $4,500 was requested
to compensate the Florida Indians for their improvements. Cf. post, p. 117. .

where its services were indispensably necessary. I purchased two
wagons, & two mules to complete the Teams I had left; but these
were wanting for the service in any event, are still on hand as good
as when purchased, and therefore caused no extra expense. The
distance proved to be somewhat greater than I expected, (caused by
necessary deviations from the Trail,) being 218 miles to the point
where it intersects the “Federal Road”;—but it is full 300 miles, if
not more to the same point by the route the mail now travels from
this place. The Soldiers, though Recruits joined from the north last
spring, have experienced no sickness of consequence,—(one man only
having died & his death was caused by the bite of a Snake, -) a practical
proof that labor in the open high woods of the South is not prej-
udicial to the health of Soldiers.”
I have with considerable trouble procured mules for Capt. Clark
& have them in readiness to send down by the first vessel. They
will be there before it would be safe for him to expose himself or men
on the Survey in the low country & Swamps through which his route
lies.” These mules cost very high, but that was unavoidable. We
wanted none but well broke mules & there were none of any kind in
the market at Mobile, consequently I had to purchase them of such
persons as had them in constant service & not over anxious to sell;
moreover the trouble & expense of having them delivered at Pensa-
cola, (as they were bought scattering & at a distance of 90 miles,)
greatly augmented their first cost.—

SIR On the first of March last, I became the proprietor of the

continued, and the Pensacola Gazette & West Florida Advertiser
established in its stead. The Floridian having been authorised to
publish the Laws of the U.S. letter of 13" November 1823;* a letter
was addressed to you immediately after the transfer, informing you
thereof and also authorising me to receive the amount of compensa-
tion which is to be paid, which was signed by Mess" John Fitzgerald &
C° and myself.” I am thus particular because the papers sent to me
containing the laws &c have always been addressed to J. F. & C*
I have now completed the publication of all the laws I have received
(the book not yet having come to hand). I had marked the laws
published, in the list in the Intelligencer; that I might inform you of
what I had not received, but the paper has been mislaid & I am not
able now to inform you. So soon as the pamphlet is received I shall
publish the Laws which are now deficient (which are only 3 or 4).
I beg leave respectfully to request that my name may be placed on the
list of Publishers of the Laws, in the place of Messrs Fitzgerald & Co.—
who do not publish a paper.
Permit me, in addition to the preceding, to mention a fact uncon-
nected therewith.—I am acting as Deputy for Col: John Miller, Clerk
of the United States’ District and Superior Court of West Florida,
which court commenced operations here in October 1822. The Clerk's
accounts have regularly been made out, certified by the Judge &
forwarded to the proper department at Washington by the Marshal;
owing to the accounts for Territorial business being included they
were not allowed, but information was received that they would be
returned here to take out the charges exclusively on United States'
business which would then be paid; this was more than three months

[NA: SD, Fla. Terr. Papers, XI: ALS]
PENSACOLA W. Florida 8th Sept. 1824.
SIR, I consider it my duty, in the absence of the District Judge to
inform you, that on the night of the 28th ulto. William F. Steele
District Attorney absconded from this place, leaving his Securities
in a prison Bounds Bond, liable for the Judgments on which he was
imprisoned—
The means by which Mr. S. was enabled to effect this last, tho not
the least of his improprieties, was as follows—The Revenue Cutter
Florida was directed by the Collecter of Key West, to bring into this
Port the Schooner “Fellspoint” of Baltimore, charged with Smug-
gling—A prize Master was put on board of her, and she sent here for
condemnation, and arrived here sometime before the Florida. Her
papers were delivered to the Collector of this Port, who instructed the
Attorney, to draw a Libel to obtain an order of Seizure—He neglected
it for three weeks, until the arrival of the Florida Cutter—when he pri-
vately informed the Officers of that Vessel, that Justice could not be
procured at Pensacola; and incouraged them to carry the prize off—
The Collector of this Port refused to give up the papers, alledging that
the Vessel was sent here for adjudication, and should not leave the
Port until she was tried; whereupon the Attorney advised that she
should go without her papers; and that night about 12 o'clock he broke
the Bounds and took passage, either in the Smuggling Schooner, or
the Cutter—Some of those who have supported him, for his abuse of
honest men, and a belief that he was a good partizan of a faction, from
the facility with which he writes news paper lampoons, affect to
believe that he will return; whilst the more sober, descreet, and respect-
able part of the community, believe we shall never see him again, and
look upon it, as an incident long since expected, and which must have
happened, had it not been for the support given to him, from the
motives above mentioned."
61 Steele had been the center of controversy for some time. See ante, XXII,
index. He presented in the Pensacola Floridian issue of June 21, 1823, a defense
of his methods in court, and in the same newspaper, June 28, 1823, is a refutation
by Attorney John Lee Williams of Steele's charges relative to a court case. The
removal of Steele was urged by Sen. Richard M. Johnson, of Ky., who presented to
the Secretary of State a bundle of papers against Steele (Memoirs J. Q. Adams, VI,
235, 240). He was replaced (post, p. 213). His last salary account covers the
period from Jan. 6 to Mar. 8, 1825, and refers to him as the “late attorney” for
West Florida (NA, GAO, Misc. Treas. Acct. No. 49132). See post, p. 289.

vey of the coast (NA, ND, SN Lets. to Officers Ships of War, Bk. 15; printed, A. S.

SIR, I consider it proper to call your attention to to the situatio

securities in that bond are William Travers and Pedro Miranda
When that bond was taken, Mr Travers was ostensably a gentleman o
independant fortune. Since, however he has made a disposition o
most of his property, and contemplates, and I believe will in a shor
time remove to the island of Cuba, to join his connextions, who re
moved to that country when Florida was ceded to the United States
Mr. Miranda is a gentleman of no personal property; that which he ha
in his possession, he states to belong to his wife, by virtue of the lat'
Spanish institutions. The Landed property of Mr Miranda, consist
chiefly of a large grant, purporting to have been made by one of th
Spanish governors of this province; the title, however, I conside
extremely equivical. I also know of my own knowledge, that M.
Miranda is somewhat embarrassed.
I presume you are not unacquainted with the circumstances of th
Marshal—
I have thought it incumbent on me, in consequence of my office
to inform you of the above information, that you may avail yourself o

GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:LS *]
TALLAHASSEE Oct 1. 1824
HONB" JOHN C. CALHOUN Secretary at War
SIR On yesterday I had the honor to receive your letter of the
17" of last Aug" * and confess that some remarks in it surprise me
greatly. In the first place I assure you the Agent did not pay one
cent either in money or Cattle to the Chief Neamathla altho he
informed me he had funds in his hands (I believe he said you had au-
thorised him to draw for $6,000)
I did order the agent to pay this Chief and was much disappointed
when I found on my arrival here that it had been neglected. You
state “The agent has rendered a statement of his accounts by which
it appears he has advanced under your orders, on a contract made by
you with M. Charis the sum of $3.000”. Their must be surely some
great mistake in this matter for I never made a contract with M*
Chaires (except for the rations which was long since the Agent left
this part of the country, and on which I did not advance him a cent
or agree to do so. Nor have I ever heard from the agent that he
paid the sum of $3,000 to M' Chaires or that he had made any con-
tract with him or any other person for the purchase of Stock cattle.
long since the agent left this part of the country I was informed by a
letter from Mr Chaires that he had made a contract with the agent
Col Humphreys for Stock Cattle, but he never informed me that the
agent had paid him one dollar in advance Nothing more is known
to me of the contract, nor has the agent made any report to me of
the fact. Altho he wrote to me on the 26" of July from St
Augustin, a copy of his letter I enclose to you. The agent has never
as I now recollect presented any of his accounts to me for my exami-
nation or approval. I have been always ready to attend to my duty
in this respect. The agent received from me written instructions on
the subject of receiving proposals on the 23" of May last "for furnish-
ing of the rations to the Indians, as well as on the subject of contract-

f
ing for Stock Cattle. My instructions directed him only to receive
proposals and to transmit them to me, and if any of the proposals
should be approved of by the proper authorities the party would be
duly informed &c.
Enclosed is a copy of a letter from the agent dated St Marks 1.
June 1824 and also a copy of a letter dated Tallahassee 31. May 1824
from M* Chaires to the agent. M. Chaires' proposals I would not
accept at 18% cents, as I informed you. I also enclose to you an
extract of that part of my instructions to the agent on the Subject of
purchasing Stock Cattle My reasons for allowing the agent at his dis-
cression, if it was necessary to do so to advance $3,000 for the Stack
Cattle was that few men could purchase and incur the expence of
driving a large heard of Cattle so far into the interior—and those
who had the means to make the advance, would not perhaps engage
in the contract. It is important to act promptly with the Indians
in paying up what they claim under the Treaty without delay The
very circumstance of the Indians learning that their agent was pur-
chasing Stock Cattle for them, to be driven within their boundary
would induce many of them to remove chearfully—who at the time
were much dissatisfyed—besides, I was confident if the contract was
made for Cows & Calves—in the spring to be delivered this fall, that
a very considerable advantage would accrue to the Indians, as the
cattle would be growing for six or seven months at the risque and
expence of the contractor, Under this view I gave the instruction
Just in the words written, which is all that was given on this part of
the subject. If the five Chiefs had gone with the agent to Washington,
and which I desired it would have answered a good purpose You
well know that during the absence of the Chiefs the Indians would
not have acted the least improper the Chiefs would be by the nation
considered as hostages in our hands for their good behavour until
their return at least. Hence I wished the leading Chiefs to visit you.
It would allow me time to make in peace and quietness all my con-
tracts for their removal and at the same time you would have made
an impression on the chiefs that would have confirmed them forever
as our decided friends, but as the chiefs failed to go & as the Indians
were ready to take up arms the agent should never have left the
Territory without permission under such circumstances.
I believe you will be perfectly satisfied with my management and
economy in executing the treaty—and whatever I do shall be per-
formed with a single eye to the public interest *
I am Respectfully Your Obt. Servt.

SIR I have just received your note informing me that my proposals

accepted.
I presume the Governor, nor yourself will doubt that my best
exertions will be used to comply fully with the contract. Permit me
to remark however that this contract in the way which it has to be
filled is unwieldy and no time ought to be lost. I hope the Governor
will say as soon as consistent to whom the bond shall be given for the
fulfilment of it, and the Contract formally entered into until that is
done it will be hazardous for me to purchase Cattle, which must be
brought from Georgia, or to make the necessary arrangement for the
purchase and Shipping of Corn and Salt. I shall nevertheless risqe
the consequences & commence making the arrangements necessary
to be made and continue so doing until advised to the contrary Houses
for the reception of the corn and Salt must be prepared which I
presume will be done under your direction at the expence of the U.S.

SIR. Enclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit to you all the
proposals made for Supplying the Indians according to the Treaty
with, Beef, Flour, Corn and Salt.
Those of Maj. Benj" Chaires of St Augustine taking into view the
Ampleness of his Security in connection with the lowness of the price
at which he offers to furnish the supplies, I could not hesitate to
consider “the best” and have therefore under your Instructions of the
16th Ult° advised him that his proposal for the entire Ration with be
accepted. Should this Mode of Supplying be approved by the proper
authority, accompanying this you will will receive a Copy of his
letter in reply—The proposal of M" Robt. Mitchel of Pensacola for the
Salt & Flour part of the Ration would have been accepted as the
lowest, had it not been saddles with provisos and Conditions foreign
to my advertisment in relation to security (which M. Mitchel was
well aware of) been complied with.
As it is however whatever Confidence I might have in his declaration
of Ability to guarantee the performance of an engagement of such
magnitude I could not feel myself authorised or warrented to Jeopard-
ize the interests of the Country or the Comfort of the Indians by
leaving the supplying of provisions to depend upon a Contingency so
precarious and unpromising, particularly as an opportunity presented
to place the contract for the whole Ration upon terms which appear
highly advantagous to the Gov" in the hands of an individual whose

without further delay to the North—Where by recent letters I learn
that my presence is much required in a business Matter of consider-
able importence to me. I shall however go by the way of Washington
City, and be governed by such information or instructions as I may
there receive from the Secretary of War, I have not now time to make
a detailed report of my tour into the Indian country from the Bay.
I can only say that the land throughout where I visited is wretchedly
bad, and in my opinion cannot long sustain the Indians should any
considerable number come from the West.
I am truly sorry to differ so widely in opinion from Col. Gadsden,
for whom I have the highest respect, but I conceive to withhold the
expression of my sentiments on this subject (although they are
unasked) would be to fail in my official obligations, and might possibly
hereafter subject me to unmerited censure. I am further urged to
the avowal from an interview I had a few days since with Miconopy,
Jumper and other Chiefs, near Okihumky. It seems evident that,
that article in the treaty providing for an extension of the Northern
boundary will be insisted upon by the Indians and I feel it a duty to
state a failure in this particular on the part of the Goverment will
produce much dissatisfaction among them and may lead to serious
difficulty. It is due to the Indians however to say that as far as can
be ascertained they are perfectly pacific in disposition and appear
to place great reliance on the Justice and fidelity of the United States
I cannot close this letter without doing an actof justice to Col. Gadsden
in declaring my belief that the Story told me by Neamathla of the
Col" having advised him against the journey to Washington is desti-
tute of foundation in truth and that it is a tale fabricated by the
old Man to Justify his own discrepency. This I Judge from dis-
covering on the subject a sort of concert between him and the Chiefs
South, this is evident though each avows ignorence of the others
sentiments and says he cannot act in the case without a meeting,
thus Clearly manifesting a wish to avoid the measure, but whether
this proceeds from aversion to extend their acquaintence with the
whites or a fear of being entrapped (as has been intimated to me)
I am unable to say. The latter is very possible as they have still fresh
in recollection the treachery practised on their nation in a Somewhat
similar occasion by the Spanish Goverment at St. Augustine and
they are not thoroughly capable of making a proper distinction
between that Goverment and the one under which they now live—I
will write again from Washington

GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:LS"]
TALLAHASSEE Oct 2" 1824
HONB" JOHN C. CALHOUN Secretary at War
SIR. The object of this letter is to explain to you my objects and
views in relation to the removal of the Indians as well as the reasons
for their immediate payment under the treaty of such sums as can be
paid with Justice and propriety before their removal. You have long
since been apprised that the Seminoles were very much dissatisfied
with the treaty"—I therefore deem it prudent before their removal
to pay them for their improvements according to the treaty; valued as
you have directed. I intend to call the Indians to St Marks and to
pay them and furnish as many rations at that point as will serve them
on their march to the country assigned them. I have held out as an
inducement for the Indians to go in canoes by water & thus provide
for their own transportation, a certain sum of from $5 to $10 for each
canoe they should make for this purpose which should be paid by me
to the individuals who made them, after the acting sub-agent should
see these canoes and report the size & number of them to me. I expect
perhaps forty or fifty canoes will be ready in three weeks. I find it
very difficult to purchase a horse of any kind here and as some must
be had, I shall send a man to procure a few in Georgia, The Stack cat-
tle intended for the Indians South will be driven there as soon as I
can ascertain any contract has been made for them—
The Gun-Smith, who should also be a Blacksmith, I will procure
if the agent does not. The ploughs, hoes, axes, &c will be sent to
Tampa Bay as soon after the removal of the Indians as a vessel can
be had to transport them from Pensacola; where these articles have just
arrived accoring to my order—The Apalachicola Indians being sta-
tionary ought to have their part of the $6,000 paid to them imme-
diately & also their sheare of the annuity. I have therefore made en-
gagements to have them furnished with cattle, & some sheep, as many
of them now spin, and several of them weave, & also ploughs &c
amounting to $800 which was the sum allowed to them out of the
$6.000, and was much less than it should have been, Of the anuity
the Apalachicola Indians should be allowed $1,500 per year, for on the
reserves there are two hundred & forty men, besides their women &
children & they are at least one fourth of the whole population. Be-
Side these people will receive no benefit of the school or the Gun &
Black Smith I hope therefore as the power is with the President to
say what proportion of annuity shall be given to them, that the facts

above stated will have their due weight. You will see by the contract
which I made with M'. Chaires for the delivering of the rations,” that
he was to issue only for ten months at Tampa Bay, my reasons for
this was, that by furnishing the Indians in this quarter with rations
it would induce them to sell out their Crops, and add to the induce-
ments for them to remove, beside the ration is furnished by Capt
Crupper one cent cheaper than those furnished by Mr Chaires
This step I feel confident was as judicious as prudent; and I daily
see the effects anticipated. I have not as yet paid Capt Crupper who
has furnished all the rations at St Marks up to this time one cent.
This has resulted of course for the want of funds. On refering to
your letter of the 20th of last April "you acknowledge the recpt of
my letter of the 25 March "enclosing the estimate of expences on
account of Indian affairs under my Superintendency for the two
first quarters of the present year, which estimate you say is admitted
[I have not as yet received any remittance on the estimate to enable
me to defray the ordinary and usual expences of the Indian Depart-
ment.—Whatever sum was placed under the controul of the agent,
none of it has come to my hands, and I trust the amount of my estimate
admitted may be remitted without delay. I wish to close my accounts
as soon as the papers & vouchers of the Indian department, now at
St Augustine shall arrive which I hope will be by the first of Nov.
next as I have determined to charter a small vessel, & have so directed,
to transport the public reccords of all the departments, together with
the books and furniture of the Legislative Council, and such as belong
to the Secretary's & superintendants office to St Marks I am the
more anxious to carry the treaty into effect & complete all the con-
tracts at an early date, because I must return this winter for my
family to Kentucky. This has also induced me to request that I
may not be longer delayed for want of funds.]"
I have sent to New Orleans for the money mentioned in your last
letter, intended for the objects mentioned therein & amounting
altogether to $13,500, this was absolutely necessary as paper money
will not be received by the Indians, and the silver could not be had
short of New Orleans, the moment I receive the specie it shall be
paid over to the Indians, and they forthwith shall march to their

will aid most cheerfully and earnestly in contributing all in my power
to effect the benevolent and virtuous objects of my Goverment. The
state of the Indians in a moral point of view in Florida would shame

vice that they commit. They are generally honest and chaste, & many
of them industrious.

of Government were not immediately complied with and was ready
as one to take the papers by a duces tecum bring them before the
commissioners & deliver them to Drs Simmons & Gibson. But on
enquiry I was induced to believe that at this time there was not
suficient danger of any thing improper being done to or with the papers
to justify it & being sensible the administration wa not wish us to
resort to any unnecessary harshness Any further proceeding was
omitted. I found my brother commissioners occupied in the daily
examination of claims presented to their consideration. The second
day after my arrival I entered on the duties of my situation & have
ever since been employed according to the best of my ability in their
discharge
From the closest observation I am satisfied in my own mind that the
Government has made a most fortunate selection in the appointment.
I am fully convinced that they are both men of the most just &
honorable feeling
Judge Floyd it is true is not possessed of any extraordinary Superi-
ority of intellect altho' I have no doubt he has a very good judgment
and the very best intentions. And any mistake into which he may
have fallen I should be inclined to attribute altho only by surmise
to his more highy-gifted associate Judge Blair but permit me to add
that both Judge Blair & M" Floyd have the popular opinion of this
territory in their favor it being the universal opinion that they were
men of the greatest honor & integrity. The Government too are
exceedingly fortunate in the district attorney for East Florida. He is
an invaluable officer faithful & indefatigable in his duty to the United
States and examines rigidly & industriously into the justice and
legality of every claim that is presented to the commissioners
We are exceedingly embarrassed for the want of clerks. our clerk
says he has one case in which it would take him three months to
translate the necessary papers & nearly as much longer to copy them

Augustine, or any part of it by contract, you are authorized to invite
proposals, & make contracts for the work. From your knowledge
of the subject, & the facility with which you may obtain informa-
tion in regard to the character & circumstances of those who offer,
you can readily determine whether the bids be reasonable, & whether
there be a probability of those who bid complying with the contract.
In the contracts, care must be taken not to exceed the appropriation.
The law forbids advances; but you might stipulate to pay the con-

The contractors must be entirely under your direction & subject to

Would it not be adviseable to commence your operations with the
whole force under your direction, in the neighbourhood of the seat
of Govt. & work towards Pensacola? The troops employed there
might operate as a check upon the Indians. You will however, in
this, as in every other matter connected with the duty confided to

to him, thro' you, as per my letter, bearing date the 11" Ultimo.”
I have no objection however to your appointment of M*. Bellamy,
provided you can make the proper arrangements with Col°. Gads-

that proposed to be made to Col°. Gadsden. Your instructions
under your letter of appointment are approved.
I have issued requisitions in your favor under the several heads of
appropriation to carry into effect the Treaty with the Florida Indians,
$26:105: 50/100—Twelve thousand six hundred and four Dollars,
50/100 of which being on account of the expense of Rations. On the
receipt of your quarterly estimates, further remittance will be made
according to the information conveyed in my letter of the 11"
Ultimo. The remittance for Indian Improvements will be made when
the report of the Commissioner is received, and approved.
All remittances on account of the Indian Department are required
to be made on estimates of the Superintendent. You will attend to
this in future.
I have issued my requisition in your favor on account of Expenses
of your Superintendency, for Two thousand Dollars, to be accounted

Sir, I have received your letter dated the 17" Ultimo * in relation
to the proposed road from Pensacola to S' Augustine. Aware of the
advantages of the road, it is my earnest wish that it be completed as
early as practicable; and to effect that object every facility in the
power of this Department shall be offered.
In order to complete the work, the more promptly, Captain Burch
the Quarter Master at Pensacola has been authorized to employ Citi-
zens to perform that part between the seat of government of Florida,
and S*Augustine, should he think it advisable so to do. The Quarter
Master General will enclose you a Copy of the instructions to Captain
Burch on the subject.”

TO THE HONOBL JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.
SIR, We take the first opportunity to acknowlege the receipt of your
letter of the 23" of August "directing us to take charge of such of the
Archives in the possession of M* Reynolds as relate to the disposition
of lands in this Territory. The day subsequent to the receipt of our
instructions we communicated them to M.” Reynolds & requested him
to inform us when he could deliver to us the papers referred to; stating
that we were ready to receive them. M* Reynolds replied, that from
the nature of those papers, & the state in which they were in, he should
decline delivering them unless a complete Inventory was made & a
receipt given for them. The Inventory to be made either by himself,
& or by us conjointly with him. The papers to remain under his
charge & controul, & we to have no other controul over them than to
assist in making the Inventory, & examining them, but with per-
mission to take under our charge each day such papers as were con-
tained in the Inventory & receipted for.
From the nature of our instructions & from a conversation with
M* Allen we were induced to believe, that this course would not

altogether comport with your views on the subject. If the ma
of the Inventory was left to him alone, there was no knowing w
it would be finished; and if made by us conjointly with him, s
time, we cannot say how long must necessarily elapse before the w
of the Archives embraced in our instructions could be under
controul. The Inventory contemplated being to be made in
following form, it must require some time to make it.
No || Grantor | Grantee "' Date of Grant No of acres

In acceding to the proposition of M* Reynolds, we should
little procrastinate the final accomplishment of the object of
instructions; but believing it to be your wish that an immed
controul over the papers, should be given to us, we proposed to
Reynolds, that we should mutually consider the papers as deliv
to us; to go on & make the Inventory, but neither him, nor u
have access to, or controul over the papers except in the press
of the other. From delicacy to M.” Reynolds we proposed that
arrangement should be known only to ourselves.
To this proposition or to any other by which he should be depri
of the absolute controul of any paper until it was inventoried,
receipt given for it he declared his determined resolution to objec
Under these circumstances we have been compelled to acced
the proposition of M* Reynolds, & have commenced making out
Inventory, & shall receive the papers as they are included in
Inventory. Believing that in pursuing this course we shall in
shortest possible time, under the determination of M* Reync
obtain the controul of the Archives, & fulfil the object of our inst
tions.
In the mean time we have communicated our instructions, &
result of our endeavours to procure the papers to the Board of L
Commissioners. What order, if any, the Board may take on
subject we are unable to say. Two of the Board M. Allen &
Murray, have said, privately, that M. Reynolds ought to h
acceded to our proposition & delivered over the papers at once.
During the two last years it has been a source of surprize, re.
& complaint by the owners of land in the Territory, that the Ket
of the Archives should allow the papers to remain in the state
which they have been, and are now—Any person might slip ou
grant for 100 acres, & put in one for 10,000. That this was ever d

except in one case, I do not pretend to say. All we know is, that in
that case a reward was offered by M. Reynolds for the detection of
the person who had taken out a small grant & put in one for 15,000
aCreS.
Honored by the trust committed to us we hope to be able to execute
it so as to give satisfaction, and that what we have done will meet
with your approbation. We would however observe, that as individuals
we would prefer the course proposed by M. Reynolds, as it would
relieve us from the possibility of any censure being cast on us in
relation to any grant, since no new paper could be foisted in or any
old one withdrawn; believing however that it was your desire that
the papers should come as soon as possible under our controul we
were willing to take the responsibility upon ourselves, as our first
proceeding would be to make a complete Index to each set of papers.
M” Reynolds informs us that the office has been closed, & no busi-
ness done in it since he received the orders from the Department of
State. And at the same time very singularly states that our not
receiving certain papers, which he had refused to deliver without an
an Inventory, caused an interruption to the business of the
Land Commission.
We were repeatedly at the office during the day examining papers,
& no hint was given that there were any ready for delivery.
We have commenced receiving them & shall take them day by day
as the Inventory is made out.”
We remain very respectfully Your ob. Sevt"

I have now the honor to transmit to you, two estimates for the first
and second quarters. I assure you that under no circumstances will
I exceed the appropriation of $65,700 in furnishing rations to the
florida emigrant Indians In a few days I shall for the last time
assemble them at S Marks to deliver them their orders to move,
and supply them with Rations for the Journey, and such means of
transportation as I am able to command
The requisition for $13,500 mentioned in your letter and the Draft
for the same on the Branch Bank of the United States at New Orleans
were received and duly acknowledged. I had long since applied to
C° James Gadsden to value the Indian improvements but the death
of his venerable Father and his private affairs induced him to decline
acting. I therefore appointed John Bellamy Esq a gentleman of known
reputation and Standing who has performed this disagreable duty.
The difficulty of reconciling the Indians to the late treaty; and to
restrain them from outrage has not been inconsiderable, but to
purswade and threaten them into a peaceable removal from this
truly delightful country, required the exercise of uncommon patience,
time, and prudence. I now believe confidently they will go without
force, but evidently with reluctance. I hesitate not to aver that even
now, was I to leave this country not one would move; when it is
recollected that the Florida Indians never were controuled untill the
United States took possession of this country and that even since they
have not for the greater part of the time had either an agent or sub-
agent with them to inform and reduce them to order; it must be
obvious that my duties have been as arduous as they are unpleasant.
Many of the Indians speak of joining the Creek nation, and my opinion
is that several hundred will go north. I have not dissuaded them this
Step, or encouraged them to leave the Territory. That portion of the
annuity which is to be distributed among the Indians who are to
remove South to the lands alloted to them under the treaty will not
be given to them untill their removal. This will be an inducement to
hasten their march as they are informed by me that untill they are
located no such distribution will be made.
I consider it would however be just and proper to pay them for their
improvements on the eve of their departure. These people are
extreemly poor, more so than any Indians in all the southern country
The money distributed to them for their improvements will furnish
them with Blankets & such things as will render them comfortable
in some degree on their march, and will give them a stronger desire
to shear the annuity—I have therefore sent to New Orleans for the
specie to meet this object and to provide them transportation (for

they will not receive any paper money) and it is expected in ei

In my letter of the 2" day of October last,” the reasons were as
for my not contracting for the delivery of rations at Tampa Bay

The commission and instructions to Co' Gadsden are receiv
well as the Drafts for $12,650 50/100 $5000 payable at Char
and $7,650 50/100 at New Orleans
The certified returns of the rations that have been, and w
delivered at S" Marks, will, as soon as the final meeting wit
Indians is over, be transmitted to you—
I have according to the power given to me by your letter

much to my satisfaction-
I have but lately returned from the Appalachicola river, w

the Indians residing there there, and on the 10" of Novembe
the residue of the Stock will be delivered to them, for all that

These Indians are more civilised than any others in Florida.

by knowing that many of the Southern Indians have no name. The
chiefs are named, but the common men generally must perform some
serviceable act. before they receive any name, It is with them a
mark of honor, hence it will be impossible in many instances to obtain
the name of the Indians.
I intend to pay them off by towns, and will require each Chief of a
town to sign the receipt, for the money payed to the Indians of his
town for improvements, this is the only way that this business can be
satisfactorily performed—After the number of houses and improve-
ments are assertained and valued the Chiefs can then point out the
men who are intitled to compensation, so that he can not impose on
me more, than, the number I have had valued and it will be his interest
to give satisfaction to those men who are alone, entitled to compensa-
tion by personally calling them up before all the town to receive
payment-
The difficulty of communiting with any post office, for the nearest to
this point is 150 miles, has induced me to take more responsibility on
myself than I should have assumed could I readily communicate with
you. The expence of establishing an express for this purpose would
have been too expensive, and as I wish to act with the utmost economy,

necessary for the service, & these will be daily & constantly employed.
It is a duty that falls upon but few, and it is within my certain
knowledge that it causes to them an expense of treble what they were
exposed to at their regular station. It is moreover a duty that
officers generally consider out of their line of duty & are therefore
averse to performing it.—But if they cannot be allowed a per diem,

[Enclosure: DS]
Memorial to Congress by Citizens of Jackson County
[November, 1824c]
A Memorial addressed to Congress by the citizens of Jackson County,
West Florida.—
Congress having manifested a disposition to remunerate the early
settlers in this territory for the toils dangers & privations which they,
in common with all who leave the abodes of civilisation to explore &
organise new countries, have experienced, Your Memorialists are
emboldened to solicit an extension of the fostering care of Government
in their behalf:—They would respectfully state that in the early part
of the year 1822 immediately after the expiration of the time appointed
by Congress for making donations of land to the first settlers, a great
part of your Memorialists removed from the adjacent states to this
territory, & that upon them & others who have emigrated subse-
quently has chiefly devolved the burden of making roads, the trouble
of finding markets, the danger of testing climate, the labour of clearing
water courses, & in short the arduous task of organising the country.
Under these circumstances your Memorialists, having a considerable
stake in this territory, feel alarmed by the consideration of what has
transpired in the state of Alabama, & are apprehensive that the fruit
of their labours will be reaped by monopolists and speculators; they
therefore pray that Congress will afford them the same protection,
which on former occasions has been granted to citizens under similar
circumstances, against those individuals who possessing an almost
unlimited command of funds, prohibit fair competition, take advantage
of the improvements of individuals and defraud the general govern-
ment. Of such abuses your Memorialists would cite an illustration
furnished at the sale of the public lands in Alabama, on which occasion,
the speculators & money holders actually required the payment of
considerable sums of money from citizens whose improved claims bore
an honorable testimony to their industry, compelling them to purchase
their right of coming into the market, & securing their own interests at
the expence of the people and the treasury.—
The immunity which your Memorialists would most respectfully &
earnestly solicit is a pre-emption in favor of their claims & improve-
ments, that they may be shielded from oppression & encouraged to
proceed with the cultivation of their claims & the improvement of
the country generally.
That Congress may not entertain the opinion that your Memorialists
themselves have formed the design of monopolising valuable tracts of
lands they would state that no individual has made a claim of more
than one thousand acres of land, & that few claims exceed six hundred
& forty acres. Your Memorialists deem it proper to observe that the

permission which Congress granted to citizens, to occupy & cultivate
the soil for some years prior to the sale of the lands will not prove
beneficial to them unless Congress should be pleased to accede to their
present petition; the lands in this section of the country require severe
labour & cultivation for several years before they come to perfection
& yield a produce that will more than clear the expences of the planter,
differing widely in this respect from the neighbouring states of Alabama
& Georgia, many of your memorialists therefore in lieu of being in
funds from the cultivation of the lands when they may come into
market, will probably have sunk property & will meet with no re-
muneration whatever for the improvement of the land, & the toils &
privations they have endured, to which it may be added that the
difficulty of transporting produce to market from many parts of the
country, has hitherto been unsually great—Your Memorialists con-
ceive that they may with the greater propriety request the indulgence
which they have suggested, because there are at present no banking
establishments in the territory, and consequently no means of meeting
upon equal terms, the speculators who connected with the banks in
the adjoining states, can command their coffers at pleasure.
The vast disproportion between the good & bad lands in this terri-
tory, must of necessity prove the cause of a comparatively thin popula-
tion & render it a very vulnerable point in time of war, & should the
valuable lands become the property of speculators, the population
will be doubtless infinitely less dense: with this view of our territorial
affairs, General Jackson when governor of Florida encouraged emigra-
tion by every means in his power, & our present respected chief
magistrate has followed the example.—
The probability that your Memorialists may here as in the state of
Alabama, be kept out of the market by monopolists, & the uncertainty
of their being able to realise their claims are reflections that tend very
much to damp the spirit of enterprise, & to retard the march of civilisa-
tion.—
When your Memorialists consider that in the years 1807” & 1808”
Congress granted a preemption to the citizens in the state of Louisiana,
giving them the lands at the government price, and also presented a
large & valuable tract of land in the state of Alabama to foreigners”
who had not levelled one oak of the forest or turned up one furrow of
land, they feel encouraged and can scarcely entertain a doubt that
Congress will grant a preemption in favor of citizens who have borne
the heat & burden of the day, & who are already identified with the
soil.

THE LAND COMMISSIONERS (WEST FLORIDA) TO THE
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
[NA:HF, 18 Cong., 2 sess.:LS]
Commissioners Office, PENSACOLA, November 13" 1824.
SIR. The Commissioners for ascertaining claims and titles, to land
within the District of West Florida, are under the necessity of repre-
senting to the Honorable Body over which you preside, their inability
to accomplish the objects of their Commission within the period fixed
by law for the termination of their Session.”
Aware of the desire of the Goverment of the U. States to have the
private land claims of Florida speedily adjusted, the undersigned have
devoted their most unremitted attention to that object. In conse-
quence, however, of the accumulated labours of the Board, imposed
by an Act of the last Session of Congress,” and the large number of
Claims presented since that time, it will be indespensible to grant an
extension similar to that given at the last Session of Congress, to
complete the whole business properly.
The Commissioners could not forsee or anticipate, the protracted
enquiries to which they were subjected in many instances to protect
the interest of the U. States and do justice to honest Claimants. But
an deeeptive imperfect estimate can be formed from an examination
of the Reports which they expect to have the honor to submit at an
early period of the approaching Session of Congress. The abstracts
of adjudicated claims contain only a Condensed view of the results
of tedious and labourous investigation.
It will be recollected that this Board did not Commence its examina-
tions untile September 1823, for causes explained in our former Com-
munication;" About one thousand claims have been presented, many
of which are contained in voluminous documents, required by law to
be recorded and translated before examination, and afterwards a
Statement of the documentary and parol proof taken down in the
Record of the “Acts and Proceedings” of the Board. After the per-
formance of this duty, so important to the U. States, and beneficial to
the Claimants in perpetuating the evidences and assurances of their
titles, the Commissioners are required in all conflicting British and
Spanish Claims to make out an Abstract of eaeh the titles of each
and report it to the Secretary of the Treasury, under the 4* Section
* The act approved Feb. 28, 1824 (4 STAT. 6–7), had extended the time limit
to Jan. 1, 1825.
* The donation act approved May 26, 1824 (4 STAT. 47), required the land
commissioners to receive, examine, and report upon claims based upon habitation
and cultivation.
* Not found. See ante, XXII, 718, n.

of the law regulating our duties—In addition to the foregoing, about
two hundred claims have been presented under the Donation Act,
the evidence in support of which, the Undersigned are required to
examine record and report. A large number of the Claims under
this act were presented by persons residing at the distance of two
hundred miles from Pensacola; the Commissioners Conceived it their
duty to avail themselves of the permission of helding the act of Con-
gress to hold their Settings in any other part of the District that
might be deemed necessary—and accordingly held a Session of two
weeks in Jackson County for the accommodation of the Claimants,
and to be accessible to witnesses on behalf of the U. States, if necessary
to prevent imposition and repulse fraud. They were absent four
weeks and have great reason to be satisfied with the Course they
thought proper to persue, as it was attended with important results
to the Goverment.
So late as the first of September last, about One hundred British
Claims were presented; These facts are refered to that Congress may
have some adequate idea of the situation of the office, and will demon-
strate the utter impracticability of completing the business within the
Session.
The Undersigned however, have determined to delay all other
proceedings, and report all claims of every description East of Pensa-
cola in West Florida, to the Secretary of the Treasury in next month,
leaving the Reports to be recorded from the Original Opinions, & the
abstracts from duplicate Copies, and reserving all the unexamined
claims in Pensacola & between it and Perdido for subsequent report.
They have been led to the adoption of this Course, that the whole
Country between this and Tallahassee, the Seat of Government, about
180 miles in extent, might be subject to such disposition as to the
Government might appear politick for the settlement of private
Claims and disposal of public lands—This proceedure has been deemed
adviseable to prevent any delay in the Survey, Settlement and Sale
of the lands
The Undersigned will take the liberty most respectfully to suggest,
that the donation act of the last Session should be so amended as to
invest the Commissioners with power to direct Surveys of the land
claimed under its provissions, as there are in many instances three or
four Claimants on the same section, and each one claiming 640 Acres;
and in many cases those of the first conflict with those of the Second
Class, and both with Spanish grants—It will be apparent from the
preceeding explanation that no dilligence could have enabled us to
complete the business within the period limited by law, and we have

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY LATE SPANISH OFFICERS
AND SPANISH INHABITANTS OF THE TERRITORY
[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[November 22, 1824]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the subscribers late Spanish Officers and indi-
vidual Spanish Inhabitants of Florida, humbly represents that in the
year 1814 when a state of Hostilities subsisted between the Govern-
ments of Great Britain and the United States of America considerable
Detachments of British Troops were from time to time landed upon the
Coast of Florida and particularly at Pensacola.—The Spanish Govern-
ment was too weak to preserve its neutrality as between Great Britain
and the United States or to restrain numerous acts of open and
public Hostility to which the Indians located within the then Province
of Florida were excited by the arts Bribes and persuasions of English
Emissaries amongst them. Your Memorialists further represent that
this State of things rendered it necessary in the Estimation of the
commanding General of the Southern Division of the Army of the
United States to march a Force into the Province of Florida sufficient
to Dislodge the British Forces from the same and to subdue the
Indians. And your Memorialists further represent that in the
prosecution of this Design a numerous Army was marched into said
province and penetrated as far as Pensacola. That vigilant as was the
commanding Officer of said Forces (and your Memorialists here beg
leave gratefully to acknowledge his unceasing Watchfulness for the
preservation of their persons and their property from Outrage and
Violation) many Injuries were yet suffered and many Losses sustained
from stragling parties of Militia and rangers.—And your Memorialists
further represent that they made repeated applications to the Govern-
ment of Spain for Compensation for the Losses above mentioned
* Reply, if any, not found. See the Secretary of War to Macon, Dec. 27, 1825
(NA, WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 12), that Macon's claim for services as Dis-
trict Attorney in the Massias case could not be allowed since usage required such
services in all cases in which the United States was concerned. See also the
Secretary of War to Douglas, Oct. 5, 1827 (loc. cit.)

accompanying the same with the Evidence of such Losses—But that
the conclusion of the Treaty of 22" Feb 1819 between the United
States and his Catholic Majesty found your Memorialists still unre-
munerated.—When the said Treaty had been ratified and was pub-
lished your Memorialists supposed and do Beleive their Case provided
for by the last Clause of the 9" Article thereof, which it is stipulated
that “The United States will cause satisfaction to be made for the
Injuries if any which by process of Law shall be established to have
been suffered by the Spanish Officers and individual Spanish In-
habitants by the operations of the American Army in Florida.”
Under this impression your Memorialists continued untill it has at
length been decided by the Authority created for that purpose by the
Government of the United States that the above cited Clause cannot
be construed to embrace the Claims of your Memorialists.—
And your Memorialists would humbly represent, that though aware
it is sometimes necessary to take private property for public uses in
time of War, a well regulated Government will render to the Owners a
just Compensation—And your Memorialists beg leave to represent
that the Government of the United States did provide “that the Judge
of one of their Courts should adjust and decide these Claims” which
was accordingly done after the most rigid and persevering investiga-
tion, in which the Judge excluded those occasioned by the British.
Your Memorialists would therefore further represent that the Claims
forwarded must then be legitimate and have all the Weight of Judicial
sanction.—And your Memorialists beg leave to represent that when
some years since the North Western Army invaded Lower Canada,
they appropriated private property to their pressing Exigences and
destroyed individual property—immediately after the conclusion of
the War an American Agent (M" Lee) was dispatched to French
Town and other places to adjust and pay for all Losses sustained by
the operations of the American Army.—And your Memorialists
humbly state that this proves the Government of the United States
have recognized and practiced the principle even with an Enemy.
Your Memorialists would humbly further represent that as they
have by the Treaty and by their continued Residence in Florida
become Citizens of the United States they can no longer expect success-
fully to urge their Claims upon the Government of Spain.—They can
therefore hope for Relief from no other source than the beneficence of
your honorable body.—

no more rations issue at S" Johns than 400 daily. If it should become
necessary to issue more than one thousand per day, they must be
issued at Tampa Bay, as the ration is higher on the S" Johns. M"
Chaires by the permission of the Secretary of War is to be allowed

wholly out of my power to sanction it. The adjustment of this ad-
vance, therefore, will be an affair between yourself and the agent, in
which I take for granted there will be no difficulty. You will receive
a credit for it when your accounts show that the Cattle for which this
sum was paid, have been delivered. I have directed the agent to
report himself forthwith to you.
Confiding in your discretion, and in compliance with your request,
I have issued a requisition in your favor for $4,500—the amount ap-
propriated to pay for the improvements which the Indians may
abandon. You will be particular in its application upon the returns
of the Commissioner appointed to value the improvements.
Your plan of providing Canoes for the transportation of the Indians
appears judicious. It is no doubt more convenient than would be the
cost of horses. It is approved.
You will apportion the annuity among the Indians according to
their numbers, giving to the Apalachicolas whatever may, upon this
bases, fall to their share.
Since the remittance of the 17* August of 13,500$,” I have issued
a requisition on the 11* Sept for $12,605 50/100," of which you were
informed, and which has, I presume, been transmitted by the Treas-

Indian Department, and for other purposes.
I have this moment received your letters of 26* Oct * & 24 Nov”,”
together with the estimates for rations for the 1* & 2" quarters.
Your appointments of M* Bellamy to value the property, and of
M" Geary to issue the rations in the absence of the agent, are approved,
and you will pay M. Geary at the rate of 500$ pr annum (the Salary
of a sub-agent,) during the time in which he may be employed, and
enter it as an item in the expense of issuing the Rations."

should it ever be necessary for the United States or individuals to
resort to that the bond of our Marshal and it prove insufficient, that I
might justly be censured, for not using some precaution to guard
against an event, I had confidently anticipated—When ever I con-
ceive it proper for me, as an officer of government, to act, I will do so,
regardless of the responsibility, no matter how great.
The Judge of the district court, has decided that the surities of the
Marshal's bond are sufficient, but I feel warranted in my own judg-
ment & opinion and believe are sustained in that of the community,
for having taken the steps I have taken in this case. As I made the
communication on this subject to your department, it is but respect to
you, that I should address you as to the result which has terminated.
I have furnished the Marshal with the date of my letter (of which
I did not retain a copy) relative to his bond, in order that he may be
enabled to procure a copy thereof if so disposed-

NOTICE OF PUBLIC SALE OF LOTS IN TALLAHASSEE
[LC:Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser, Jan. 1, 1825]
TALLAHASSEE, Capital of Florida. [December 18, 1824]
The Commissioners appointed under the act of the Governor and
Council of the Territory of Florida,” will on the first Monday of
April next, proceed to sell in the principal square, to the highest
bidder, the lots of Tallahassee; the plan of which embraces one
hundred and sixty acres of land, and will be submitted on application
and on the days of sale, for the information of purchasers. The
terms prescribed by said act, are six per cent advance on the cost of
* NA (SD, Dom. Lets., XX).
* Dated Dec. 11, 1824 (Fla., Acts, 1824, pp. 158–161). Sect. 1 of this act
gave to the site selected for the seat of government the name of Tallahassee.
This region had once been the home of the Apalachee Indians, a tribe which had
been exterminated during the wars of the 18th century or had migrated to
Louisiana where the survivors disappeared. An Indian name meaning “Old
Town,” Tallahassee had also been the site of San Luis de Talimali, the principal
Spanish mission center. The act provided for the laying off of the town by a
surveyor to be appointed by the Governor, who was also authorized to appoint
three commissioners to conduct the sale of lots and to contract for the erection
of public buildings. See statement by Gov. DuVal, Aug. 3, 1824 (Thomas,
Archs. Fla., p. 153), explaining the selection of the site for the capital as being
in the center of the richest land in the territory.

each lot; the residue in three equal, annual instalments, and the lots
and individual security held bound for the payments, on the comple-
tions of which, titles will be made to the respective owners.
Tallahasee is situated about nineteen miles north of St. Marks
near three navigable streams, in a fine fertile country, growing sugar
cane and sea-island cotton, and watered by never failing stream and
fine springs.
Public Buildings.
The Commissioners will be prepared to receive proposals, immedi-
ately after the sale of the lots of Tallahassee, for the erection of one
wing of the public buildings, to be of durable materials. Persons who
may be disposed to undertake a work of considerable importance,
would do well to attend. A plan will be submitted for the information
of those persons interested, and none need apply, who may not be
enabled to give satisfactory security for the faithful performance of
his contract.”

Sir, Your letter of the 15 Nov * has been received and I am happy
to hear of your safe arrival at the point of destination, and that you
will be able so promptly to proceed to the Survey of the Public lands.
It would I presume be desirable to have a sale in May next, if it
should only be for ten Townships, but to do this it will be necessary,
in order to give sufficient notice of the time of sale, that I should be
advised of the Range in which the Townships proposed for sale lye,
& of the Number and position of the Townships

any time previous to the day of sale,

Surveys to be connected with those made by Freeman" and Coffee
in the stte of Alabama, as all those lands are public lands, it will not
be indispensably necessary to confine the Surveys to the line of
demarcation, it will be proper to make references to, and note that
line on the Township plats, where it varies from the Surveys in Ala-
bama. The circumstances in relation to the line from the junction
of Flint river with the Chatahoutche to the head of St Marys River
are different, and as the lands claimed on the one side of this line
belong to Georgia, more precaution in making the Surveys to this line
will be requisite.
I understand that in consequence of some obstacles presenting
themselves M Ellicot * did not actually run this part of the line of
demarcation, that having reached the Chatohootchie he went round
to the mouth of St Marys and ascended that river to the head, or
nearly so, where he formed a Stone monument on the SE side of the
Okefinacan * Swamp as designating the head of the main branch of
the St Marys river, and the point called for in the Treaty. This
point being therefore established under the authority of the United
States, who were the proper and conpetant authority so far as re-
spected them and the State of Georgia, it must be taken and con-
sidered as one of the fixed points in the boundary line between Georgia
& Florida, whether it may be actually North or South of the true point
Or not,
The junction of the Flint and Chatachootchie being the other point
fixed by the Treaty, you will therefore ascertain the point established
by M Ellicot on St Marys, which I presume can readily be done, as
I see it designated on Vignoles map of Florida, from this point a line
should be run to the Chatootechie, and thence to the junction of Flint
river, from which last point a corrected line should be run to Ellicots
monument, which line will be considered by you as the proper bound-
ary line between Florida and Georgia, and up to which you will cause
your Surveys to be made.
In the estimates submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury I have
asked for an appropriation for the Surveying of one hundred Town-
ships in Florida, exclusive of the private claims, it is uncertain how-
ever what amount will be appropriated"

JAMES GADSDEN TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS"]
Kerville Tomoka Dec. 21. 1824
SIR I have to report to you my return to this place having failed
in accomplishing the object of my Commission ”—The day after my
departure from hence we encountered most inclement weather, which
in conjunction with the innundated character of the country in which
we were operating; the uncommon warmth of the season; the badness
of the water; and the unavoidable fatigue we were exposed to soon
generated disease in my camp which increased to such an alarming
degree on my arrival at the S. Lucie river as to leave me but 3 effective
men, a number not even sufficient for the necessary attention to the
sick—Finding it therefore impossible to advance; the only alternative
left was to retreat by short marches, halting as often as necessary,
upon my old blazes—I have thus succeeded in returning my party,
with the loss of two buried in the wilderness, to this place—Notwith-
standing the distressing circumstances which have thus embarrassed
my operations; I have succeeded in marking, in my opinion, the most
direct practicable route of a road as far as the St Lucie River and about
% of the distance to Cape Florida if not the whole of the distance
contemplated by the act of Congress—The S Lucie is unquestionably
beyond the ultimate limit of population on the Atlantic border of
Florida (excepting such establishments as may be made for the object
of wrecking & fishing near the Cape) and from the character of the
country far south of any point from which an enemy would attempt
hostile operations—Both for military purposes therefore and as a
convenience to future Inhabitants on the Atlantic border, the route
of a road has been marked to its full extent—I am inclined to the
opinion however after a somewhat minute examination of the country
that the improvement of the inland navigation as far as the Southern
point of Indian River would effect the objects which government have
in view by a road, at a much less expense—For Military purposes it
would be superior and as a convenience to future settlements on the

Atlantic coast of Florida it would be preferable—The only land fit
for cultivation is upon the immediate margins of the Rivers, which
strictly speaking are inlets from the sea and run parallel with it—The
inland navigation would be bringing the means of transportation to
the very door of each inhabitant, while the road from the nature of
the ground must necessarily be from 1 to 2 miles West of each Settle-
ment—A road could not, from the flat character of the country could
not be accomplished without much labor & consequent expence
(without calculating the possible loss of lives from operating in a
country unfriendly to those not acclamatized—
The population from the real poverty of the country south of the
Moschetto never can be dense, and consequently will not be capable
of preserving the road from delapidation after completed—The only
expense to be encurred in the Inland navigation, to the extent noted,
will be in opening a canal at the Haul over between Indian River &
the Moschetto, the distance of which is represented not to exceed one
mile—With these impressions I suggest to your consideration the pro-
priety of first placing in complete repair the old King's road, which
has been marked by me as far as Tomoka and may be traced without
much difficulty beyond to Smyrna—and secondly that of opening a
canal at the Haul over—The first operation may be performed at a
comparatively trifling expense—It is already in a tolerable condition;
the old causeways only requiring repair and the small creeks which it
crosses to be bridged—These are all of inconsiderable width, averaging
perhaps from 25 to 30 feet—I have not the time by this opportunity;
as I am anxious to dispatch my sick to St. Augustine, to furnish you
with an estimate of probable cost in detail; but if Soldiers are to be
employed in the operation I hesitate not in expressing it as my opinion
that with judicious management $5000 will accomplish the object—
As to the 2" operation, The canal at the Haulover, I will report to
you after a personal examination of the situation—I have sent to town
for a reinforcement of men and the interval I shall employ in making
the necessary examination when I will write you on the subject—
In marking the Indian boundary I shall necessarily be compelled to
approach within 30 or 40 miles of the point on the S. Lucie where my
recent operations terminated-I contemplate therefore obliquing to
that position & continue the route of the road as contemplated, if
practicable—From all the information however I have been able to
collect; It would seem that the St Lucie is within 30 miles of the most
southern point to which a road can be made—Beyond that the
Country is cut up by bayous & morasses and so impassible as to com-
pel the Indians to seek the sea sand beach in order to effect a journey
to the Cape—These uncertainties however will be ascertained from

personal inspection when you will receive a detailed report from me
embracing all the objects to which my attention has been directed
by your Communication
I conclude with reiterating my suggestion as to the propriety of ob-
taining an appropriation this session of Congress for the road as far as
Tomoka or Smyrna—If the Government hereafter should persist in
extending it to the Cape [MS. torn] much will have been already per-
formed & the whole operation cannot be accomplished in a single
season—The distance
from St Augustine to Tomoka 44% miles—
From Tomoka to Spruce Creek 15%

mond, Abraham Bellame, Sen Francis J. Ross of Duval County, and
Benjamin Chaires of St Johns County in the Territory of Florida for
and in consideration of the sum of thirteen thousand five hundred
dollars, hereafter to be paid to the said John Bellamy or his heirs
Executors &" have and do agree to the following conditions for the
faithful performance of which they hereby bind themselves their heirs
Executors &" jointly and severally in the penal sum of Twenty seven
thousand dollars—.
ARTICLE 2* The parties to the first part hereof agree to open and
constructaroad from the landing at “Murrays Ferry on the East Bank
of the Ocholochony" river to the west Bank of the St. Johns river
opposite to Picolata," in the following manner, to wit.
First. The route for the road is to be confined to the trail marked
out by said Burch for a public road under the orders of the War
Department in the winter of 1823–24, which route is designated by
marked trees thereon, blazed on each side—East and west with a notch
under each blaze, no deviation is to be made therefrom exceeding
three miles, and then solely with a view to the selection of proper
ground for the road and to avoid pondy and marshy places—The road
is to be opened in “Reaches” and staked out as strait as practicable,
keeping in view the general direction of the road, the ascent and
declivities of hills, and other localities of such a nature as to cause
necessary deviations from the straight line. The hills in the route of
the road when steep are to be cut down and so wound around by the
course of the road itself as to reduce as much as practicable the steep-
ness of the ascent, and to render them practicable for carriages or
loaded waggons.
Second—The road is to be opened sixteen feet wide through out,
and all timber, brushwood, and other rubbish or impediments to be
removed from it, any holes that may be in the limits of said road are
to be filled up with earth and rammed hard. The stumps are to be
cut down as low to the ground as possible, and as much as is practi-
cable hollowed into the centre in cutting them, so as to retain the rain
and moisture. All marshy, miry, swampy ground is to be cause-
*5 Ochlockonee.
* Another contract for opening in the same manner the section of the Pensa-
cola-St. Augustine road from the east bank of the Apalachicola River opposite
Ochessee Bluffs to Murrays Ferry on the west bank of the Ochlockonee River was
also signed on Dec. 21, 1824 with Jonathan Robinson, John Lines, Edward A
Robinson, Joseph M. White, and Richard J. Compton. The payment was to be
$3,000 and the road was to be completed by Apr. 30, 1825 (NA. WD, QMG Reg. of
Contracts, 1). See also text of contract between Burch and John Bellamy, Sept.
28, 1825 (loc. cit.), to open and construct a road from the east bank of St. John,

wayed with poles or split timber from 5 to 8 inches in diameter at the
least end, laid down compactly side by side across the direction of the
road—
The causeways are to be fifteen feet wide, and to be secured at each
side with heavy riders firmly and securely staked down. Ditches
four feet wide and three deep are to be dug on each side of the cause-
ways, and the earth and sand taken therefrom, thrown up on to them
and levelled thereon leaving it convex, or the highest in the centre,
and when the swamps or other grounds causewayed are of such a
nature that the ditches will not afford sand sufficient to cover the
causeways a sufficiency is to be carried on to them dry from other
places. At proper intervals in long causeways or through very wet
ground, open log ridges are to be constructed therein to let the water,
pass through freely. Where any separate causeway shall exceed one
hundred yards in length it is to be opened in the centre (or at each
distance of a hundred yards as the case may be) to the width of
Twenty feet, for a distance of at least forty feet in length All branches,
streams, creeks, Lagoons or rivers (excepting the Souwannee River
at which a ferry flat is to be built of suitable size,) are to be bridged
in the most substantial manner: if such streams &" be less than ten
feet wide, with strong and permanent log abutments for the floor
beams to rest upon—and if it be more than ten feet wide, with staunch
frame bridges built upon trestles or arches none of which are to be
more than fourteen feet apart—The main timbers of the bridges are
not to be less than twelve by twelve inches squared and hewed and
when the length of the uprights are twenty feet in height, measuring
from the mud sell to the Cap sill, they are to be fourteen by sixteen
inches squared and hewed. The mud sills are to be logs not less
than two feet in diameter, hewed on the upper and lower sides, the
bark taken off the other two sides, and to extend at least four feet
at each end beyond the exterior sides of the up rights. The uprights
are to be firmly secured into the mud sills and Cap sills by mortices
and tennons with two pins in each, and to be firmly braced with
timbers of five inches squared and hewed, with mortices and tennons
pinned in like manner. The floor beams of the bridges are to be
four in number, one on each side of the bridge resting at each end
on the cap sill and immediately over the uprights, and the other
two equi distant from the side beams and from each other. The
flooring of the frame bridges is to be of sawed plank three inches
thick. The other bridges may be covered with split or hewn pun-
cheons of the same thickness. The bridges are to be twelve feet
wide in the clear, that is twelve feet wide measuring from the exterior
sides of the uprights at the cap sill. These planks or puncheons are

to be firmly pinned to the beams at each end. No timber whatever
is to be used in the construction of the bridges except “light wood”
or heart of pine, or some other wood known to be equally hard durable
and lasting, whether under the water or exposed to the air. The
bridges are to be built so high above the water that no part thereof
from Bank to bank shall ever be exposed to danger from the effect of
the highest freshets. Good and staunch hand rails are to be affixed
to the Bridges.
ARTICLE 3" The parties to the first part hereof do agree to com-
plete said road and to have it ready for inspection and delivery on or
before the 30" December of 1825–
ARTICLE 4" It is mutually agreed by the contracting parties
that the party of the second part shall have the right to examine and
inspect the progress of the work from time to time as he may see
proper, and give such general directions as do not militate from the
true meaning and spirit of this contract; and in the event that the
parties of the first part shall be manifestly opening and constructing
the road not according to this contract, and shall moreover disregard
or refuse to notice the representations of the party of the second part
respecting that fact in regard to the contract or work itself, then the
said party of the second part shall have power to annul this contract,
and the parties of the first part thereby forfeiting all claim for compen-
sation under this contract or for the work done.
ARTICLE 5* It is mutually agreed by the contracting parties
that when the road embraced by this contract is reported ready for
inspection: and delivery that the party of the second part shall
immediately thereafter inspect & receive it; and it is moreover
mutually agreed that if any difficulty should arise between the con-
tracting parties, respecting the manner in which any part of the work
is done, such difference shall be decided and settled between said
Contracting parties by some disinterested third person chosen by
them jointly; and the parties of the first part hereby agree to defray
all expenses accruing or arising from such reference.
ARTICLE 6* The party to the second part hereof doth agree to
allow the other party to leave all such small streams as have firm
sandy bottoms and banks as fords; provided such streams are known
never to be deep enough in the wettest seasons of the year as to en-
danger or interrupt passing either by Carriages, Horses or foot
passengers, provided too that the Banks be dug down at the fords to
such an angle as shall afford easy crossing for loaded waggons; But
the party of the second part herein reserves to himself the right
expressly to decide between himself and the other party, when receiv-
ing the road whether such stream ought to have been bridged or not,

Collector's office District of PENSACOLA December 28. 1824.
SIR, Herewith enclosed I beg leave respectfully to submit for your
information, the Decision of the District Court of West Florida, on the
trial of the Schooner Dolce Nombre de Maria, and at the same time
have to assure you that nothing was wanted on my part or that of
Mr Barkley the Inspector, to effect a condemnation of said vessel &
cargo. At the time I detected Captain Petiton smugling goods from
on board said Schooner, I applied at the office of the prosecuting
Attorney of the District W" F. Steele Esq. for a process against the
Vessel &c, but learned that he had lately left the Territory of Florida,
under circumstances which rendered it probable that he would not
return; after advising with the best counsel, I though it my duty to
employ an attorney to prosecute these suits; and Adam Gorden Esq."
acting then as prosecuting attorney in the County Court of Escambia
I employed him to issue the necessary process, and associated with
him John Lee Williams Esq as counsel to make out the pleadings, the
suits were instituted accordingly but M. Gorden being called to the
seat of Government for the Territory, I advised M. Williams to employ
Col: Jo" M White as assistant counsel, as the Defendants were bringing
from Mobile the best Counsel that could be employed.—At the time
of trial M Steele unexpectedly made his appearance, assumed his
station in Court as attorney for the United States. and objected to all
the process & pleadings unless the name of M* Gorden should be
wholely struck out and his own substituted in his stead, he assumed
the prerogative of examining all the witnesses in fact he would manage
the whole cause in his own way, I submitted his claims to the Court
which having only suspended Steele as attorney on the civil side of the
Court, and having submitted his conduct to the chief of his Depart-
ment, the Judge did not see proper to debar him from the exercise of his
official Duties without advice from the President of the United States.
he was therefore permitted to controul the proceedings in his own way,
and being unacquainted with the testimony and the various facts, on
which the mertis of the Cause depended, it was finally lost as it
respected the condemnation of the Wessel her tackle apparel &c &c,
and he entered a Nol Prossi in the suit for the penalty of the fine
against the Prize Captain, in the face of the most palpable testimony
and against the protestations of the assistant counsel and my own
wishes; with the conduct of the gentlemen who I employed I am satis-
fied, and am certain that but for the interference of M. Steele I should
have been completely successful in both suits.—

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[NA:SF, 18 Cong., 2 sess.:DS*]
[December 28, 1824]
To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled.
The memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida
respectfully represents; That influenced by a confident belief, that
the improvement and population of Florida is peculiarly a subject
of national concern; That it is all important to the United States to
strengthen a frontier, to which nature has assigned so large a portion
of sea coast, and Agricultural resources; we need no additional en-
couragement to lay before Congress our views in relation to these
objects.
Your Memorialists on referring to the characters of the climate
soil and topography of this Territory and considering its capacity
for producing the orange, the olive and the vine, together with sugar
and cotton and the more valuable tropical staples, cannot but lament
that these resources should lay dormant and that objects of so much
* A certified copy of this memorial is also in NA (SF, 18 Cong., 2 sess.), printed

Augustine E. Fla. Herald, Jan. 25, 1826, and in Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla.

national wealth should be withheld from the industry and enterprise
of the Citizens of the United States.
This condition of the Territory your memorialists ascribe to the
delay attendant on the adjustment of the land claims and the want
of a legal and settled line of demarcation between public and private
property. The planter cannot emigrate to Florida, because he cannot
purchase lands with a clear legal title; the old inhabitants of the
Territory are suffering under poverty and distress, and there is a
general inactivity in Agriculture and a consequent depression in
commerce and trade; all of which evils your memorialists are of
opinion might in a great measure be removed by the interposition
of Congress in terminating or modifying the system of investigating
land claims, which seems to have been so ineffectual in producing
an adjustment, And your memorialists would suggest whether it
would not comport with justice and with the interest of the United
States that such of the land claims as may be rejected or undecided
by the land commissioners, may at the option of the individuals
concerned be carried before the Superior Courts for decision and that
Congress in its wisdom might give to the said commissioners such
latitude in their operations as might afford more facility to the object
of adjustment.
Your memorialists consider as another object of primary importance
the opening of a canal across the Peninsula of East Florida from the
river Suwaney to St. Johns or between such other points as on examina-
tion may prove to be more eligible; Such a canal, by opening a passage
from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic would in an eminent degree,
develope the agricultural resources of Florida, enhance the value of
the public lands, promote the intercourse and enlarge the commerce
of the Atlantic and western states and in time of war would give
celerity and energy to the operations of the general government;
and it is believed that in no part of the United States could an object
of so much public utility be promoted with less difficulty or expendi-
ture, the Peninsula being intersected at various parts by water
courses, the connexion of which would render the expense of this
work an object of comparative insignificance.
Another subject to which we would call the attention of Congress
is the condition of the settlers on public lands; Urged on by a spirit
of enterprise which no obstacles or danger could subdue they have
during the three preceding years at great expense and loss opened
roads and pioneered the way for future settlers, and thus afforded
information relative to the resources and topography of a considerable
portion of the Territory. Experience has shewn that whatever may
be the merits of settlers upon the public lands their interests are never

secure against the cupidity of the speculator and it is humbly con-
ceived that a liberal and enlarged policy on the part of the general
Government points to the improvement of the public lands, of the
Territory as an event whose importance bears no comparison with
that of disposing of these lands for a price even greater than that
which has ever been heretofore received for public lands in Alabama
or elsewhere. Acting under the influence of these views we do not
hesitate to impart to the wishes of the people of Florida in this respect
the humble sanction of this body, and we would add that the settlers
spoken of do not hope for more than pre-emptions of the same lands
which they have settled and improved up to as late a period as congress
in its beneficence may choose to grant it.
In thus pointing towards objects of public usefulness we would not
omit that of education. The endowment of a Territorial University
is in the power of Congress and your memorialists have to ask that
one or more Townships of the public lands of this Territory be granted
for this purpose to be located in the Middle District under the direc-
tion of the Governor and Legislative Council—And that the Cities of
St. Augustine and Pensacola for the purposes of education and police
be endowed with the public lots therein not otherwise appropriated;
these lots although of a value unimportant to the United States could
be beneficially applied to the convenience of the inhabitants and to
the protection and prosperity of the rising generation.
For the accomplishment of these and all other objects of public
utility, Your memorialists unite with their fellow citizens in a reliance
on the wisdom of Congress for such assistance and cooperation as may
comport with the station which this infant Territory holds in the
union.”

THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY TO JAMES LLOYD
[NA:HF, 18 Cong., 2 sess. :LS]
NAVY DEPARTMENT December 29th 1824.
SIR In answer to your letter of the 21" inst: "I have the honor to
state, that there are no “cases of piratical depredations, or other
information on the subject in the possession of the Department,
which are not referred to in the Report accompanying the President's
Message” to Congress."—No reports of cases have been received,
except those made by Naval Officers, of such as have come, in some
way under their own observation.—No memorandum has been kept
of the cases detailed in the Public Journals; but some of them have,
occasionally, been enclosed to the Commanding Officer of the Station
to afford him information in the discharge of his duties.—
In answer to your enquiries, respecting the views of the Depart-
ment, I enclose Copy of a letter addressed to the Hon” B. W.
Crowninshield, Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs in the
House of Representatives, dated the 21" inst: lettered A.” which
states the description and amount of Naval force supposed to be
proper, as an augmentation of that now employed in the West Indies
and Gulf of Mexico.
The “additional means” alluded to, as proper to be entrusted to the
Executive, if an efficient co-operation of the local Governments could
not be obtained, were, three or four Frigates or Sloops of War, with
boats for pursuit of the Pirates;-authority to pursue them, wherever
they might attempt to escape; and authority to enforce a rigorous
blackade, if other efforts should prove ineffectual.
I have not supposed that it would be expedient to authorise, by law,
our Merchant Wessels to arm. Should Congress entertain a different
opinion on this point, and pass a law on the subject, it should embrace
“Provisions and restrictions,” similar to those contained in the 3" &
4th Sections of the “Act to authorise the defence of the Merchant
Vessels of the United States against French depredations,” passed
25th Of June 1798."—

Paper lettered B, herewith communicated," contains a statement of
all the vacancies in the Officers of the Navy, which have occurred
since 1819; accompanying which is a copy of the Naval Register for
1824.—
I have not yet received any accurate information from surveys,
made since the last Session of Congress, relating to the advantages of
St: Marys, Charleston, and Pensacola, as places of Naval Deposit.—
The results of those which have been ordered cannot be expected before
the end of this Session of Congress.—
In the mean time from maps, charts, and surveys formerly made
by the U. S. Engineers, and Naval Officers, I feel authorized to express
the following opinions.—
Although there is deeper water, at St Mary's, yet it has less ad-
vantages than Charleston as a place for slight repairs, and occasional,
or permanent deposit, to meet the wants of our smaller Wessels, em-
ployed in the West IndiaSeas, and on the Atlantic Coast of the Southern
States.—They may occasionally rendezvous with advantage at the
latter place.—
Pensacola is entitled to a decided preference over every other port
in the Gulf of Mexico, as a place of general deposit for Naval Stores,
and of rendezvous for our Wessels which may be employed in that
quarter.—The enclosed paper lettered C,” affords the best view of
its advantages, which can, at this time, be presented.—It was written
in answer to enquiries made by me of the Engineer Department.—I
would respectfully suggest, however, that it ought not to be published,
but after being used for the information of the Committee and the
Senate, be returned to this Department.—
The necessity of having some place in the Gulf of Mexico, to which
our Wessels can resort for Stores, and ordinary repairs; becomes every
day greater.—The immense interests, connected with the Mississippi,
and other waters which fall into the Gulf, and our increasing Com-
merce, in that quarter, arising from the growing wealth and population
of the West and South West portions of our Union, demand and must
receive additional care and attention.—This will require that our
Wessels should remain more permanently there and should not be
obliged to return to the Middle or, North of the United States, when-
ever they need repairs, or stores.—Pensacola is believed to be the only
place where provision can be made to supply their wants.—I would
respectfully suggest however, that it would not be prudent at this
time for Congress to locate either a Navy Yard or Depot, in the Gulf
of Mexico;—but that power should be entrusted to the Department,

to select the place, and an appropriation of $100,000, be made, to
meet the expenses incident to the purchase of a site, and erection of
the necessary Store houses. This course is suggested because the
Department will be better able, after further surveys and examina-
tions by competent officers, to locate prudently, and purchase econom-
ically.—
What sum of money will be eventually necessary to complete the
establishment, it is imposssible now to estimate with accuracy.—The
sum mentioned, is supposed sufficient, to buy the land, and to make
such buildings as present necessities may require.—It is possible
that a less sum will be sufficient for the present year.—

FAILURE OF THE PENSACOLA MAIL
[LC: Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser, Jan. 1, 1825]
The Mails.—For three weeks past we have been disappointed with
regard to the mails; two of the three which came last, brought us far
short of the usual supplies of papers, and by the last we have received
but a single paper from the North. These repeated failures cannot be
accounted for, and we hope the same cause of complaint may not exist
long. Our readers will excuse the scarcity of foreign news in our paper
to-day, as it is occasioned by the want of papers to extract from.”

as may be uncovered by private and valid titles and at the same time
unnecessary to the General Government.—Your Petitioners presume
that the Land Commissioners have already presented to Your Honor-

Your Petitioners placing full confidence in the intelligence & justice
of their investigation of the subject, are perfectly satisfied to abide
the decision of their report, by confirming which Your Petitioners
will be enabled to commence the improvements of the Streets, Wharves,

TALLAHASSEE, Jan. 7. 1825.
SIR, I had the honor of mentioning to you, at Washington, that,
after my arrival here, I should, probably, forward to you a report on
the state of the country.
I found that the public measures here had been modelled, accord-
ing to my conception, with such sound judgment, and with such
resolution and foresight, as to render unnecessary a farther prosecu-
tion of that intention.
For these felicitous results our country is, principally, indebted to
the talents, the activity, and the integrity of the Governor, William P.
Duval; and it is due to that candor, with which I would wish to con-
duct myself toward all mankind, not to withhold my humble testi-
monial to his merits.”

SIR I have this day returned from the Survey of the road to the
Santaffy river.” where I have intersected Capt Burch" Trail leading
from Pensacola to St Augustine—I have Chained and marked the
Road through, I find the distance one hundred & forty two miles—
The Rout I have taken is very direct and I am satisfied it is the
nearest and most practicable rout to intersect that Trail that Could
have been taken—The Country from this to Chickuchaty. forty one
miles, is generally low and covered with Ponds and Cypress Swamps,
which renders it impossible to Select dry Ground for a Road the
whole distance. Many places will require Causeways and Several
Small Bridges, the only Considerable Stream is Alligater Creek

Sixteen Miles from this. This Stream is about twenty yards in width,
I found the banks Sufficiently high for a Bridge to Stand above high
water Mark, The other Small Creeks are fordable at all Seasons—
From Chickuchaty, I struck a high Pine ridge, and followed it thirty
five Miles to the Amaxura River.” Below the Forks I found this
Stream about Sixty Yards in width, very deep, and in many places
rapid I examined the Stream for some distance but Could find no
place where a bridge will rest with any Security, a ferry will be neces-
sary, the banks are very low for some distance back from the Stream
on one side—It is navigable for Boats of forty Tons for some distance
above where I crossed it, Small Vessels Can run up to the mouth of
the river at Key Anchlote, with the Supplies necessary for Opening
the Road, and taken from the Vessel into Barges up to the Point
where the road Crosses, where a deposit should be made—
Three Miles from the Amaxura I crossed Spring Branch, a Stream
about Sixty Yards in width fordable (as my Guide informs me) at all
Seasons the general depth of the Stream about four feet a firm rocky
bottom—This Stream is produced from a large Spring which rises in
the long Swamp, and empties into the Amaxura about ten miles
below where I crossed it—I do not find it laid down upon any Chart,
The Country between the two Streams is low, but firm hard ground
for a road.
From Spring Branch I rose a dry Pine ridge, and followed it sixty
three miles to Santaffy natural Bridge, where I intersected Capt
Burch" Trail leading to St. Augustine-I deemed it unnecessary to
follow that Trail to the Suwannee River, as it has been already
chained and marked out, The distance from where I Struck the Trail
to Suwannee, is forty Miles, and forty five to the St Johns River.
There is a very great sameness in all the Country from Chickuchaty
to the Santaffy, -Five Miles north of Chickuchaty I passed through
the large Hammock as it is Called, apparently very good Soil, the
Timber Oak, Hickory, Ash, Bay &". From that to the Santaffy it is
generally dry Pine Land, on the right and left of the road Cypress
Swamps, and Ponds occasionally. From Cantonment Brooke to
Chickuchaty it is generally a Champaign Country low and wet—
Four miles South of Chickuchaty I passed through a Hammock three
fourths of a Mile, apparently good Soil, I passed no Indian Towns or
Settlements except Chickuchaty, this Town Contains about fifty
Souls they Cultivate a small field but produce very little Corn, I
could obtain nothing from them-
I found it necessary to Pack Supplies the whole distance, nothing
Could be obtained on the rout., I marked the road through built a

2. The original instructions to Commodore Porter,” and now in
possession of the Commodore, and the reports from this Department
to the President of the United States, at the beginning of the last and
present Session of Congress,” shew the light in which the Department,
has viewed it as a place of Rendezvous and depot of supplies for our
vessels, engaged in the suppression of Piracy. It was originally
selected, has heretofore been used, and is now proposed to be con-
tinued, for those purposes, to avoid a return to the United States
when stores are necessary, which would consume a great portion of
the time of our Small vessels, and render them useless. It has never
been used, for other objects, without great expense, nor can it here-
after be used. How far it is Susceptible of military defences so as to
make it a valuable position in a period of war, I am not prepared to
say. This can only be determined, by the examination of competent
engineers.

CANTONMENT BROOKE 11" January 1825
SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith an estimate of the
probable amount of funds necessary for opening the road to the
Santaffy River, to intersect the road, marked out by Cap" Burch
from Pensacola to St. Augustine; "
This estimate is founded upon the belief that the road will be
opened by the Troops. The road from this to Chichuchaty, will
require several small bridges, and causeways, beyond that nothing
is required but to remove the Timber, the Country undulating pine
lands, until it reaches the Amaxura, and beyond that to the Santaffy
the Same, The greatest expense will be in transporting the supplies,
necessary for the Troops Teams &c. For opening the road to Chichu-
chaty the supplies, must be taken from this place either on Mules,
or waggons, beyond that they can be taken from Pensacola in the
Public Transport, to Anchlote Keys the Mouth of the Amaxura,
and in barges from that to the point where the road crosses the river,
I think there will be no difficulty in getting some person to establish
a Ferry at the River, as it is a very good grazing Country for Cattle,
on both banks, and a Small Hammock of good land, a short distance
from where the road will cross.
I regret the Season was so far advanced when I received the Order
for the detail to accompany me, The Winter rains have commenced,
I shall find it very difficult to complete the Survey South, The Indians,
and Spanish Fishermen, inform me the Country is very low and
covered with Cypress swamps, which during the rainy season are
impassable for pack Horses,
I shall be detained a few days waiting the arrival of the public
Transport to take supplies and meet me at Charlotte Harbour, so
soon as she arrives I shall proceed South and complete the Survey
if practicable.”

Inhabitants of St. Augustine to Daniel Burch "
S*AUGUSTINE, 1* Jan, 1825.
CAPT" D. E. BURCH, Ass" Q Master—
SIR—We, the subscribers, having understood that a bridge, as a
part of the road to be constructed from Pensacola to this city, and
placed in your charge, is to be built across S' Sabastian's Creek; and
that it is intended to erect that bridge at the place called the Estacada;
we beg leave to call your attention to the advantages that will arise
from that bridge crossing this creek at the place known by the name
of Pepino's Ferry.
S*Sabastian's Creek runs parallel with this city on the west, and
close by; Pepino's Ferry lies abrest of the midway part of this city,
about a quarter of a mile distant; the Estacada is to the north, two
miles from its northern extremity.
The distance in making the road from Picolata, on S" John's River,
by the way of Pepinos Ferry, would not be greater than by the Esta-
cada, the ground at least as good. The travel to town from any part
of S’ John's River between Picolata and the bar, an extent of seventy
miles, would be the same by the one as by the other place. But from
above Picolata, and from along the eastern sea-board south of this
city, which is to contain the most dense population of this Territory,
the distance would be shortened to travellers from one to four miles
by the way of Pepino's Ferry than by the Estacada. The bridge at
the former place will afford the inhabitants of S’ Augustine a very
desirable recreation, of which they would be debared by the distance
and difference of situation at the latter.

information descriptive of the country through the roads from St. Augustine to
Pensacola, and from Colerain to Tampa Bay may have been located. See also
resolution in the House, moved by Del. White, Jan. 3, 1826, “that the Committee

SIR, I arrived here with the Barges after a close examination of the
coast, but have heard of no pirates or piracies. I shall continue my
course to leeward, and then proceed to Thompson's Island.
The non arrival of the Fox with the surveying officers has prevented
my executing any part of your orders respecting the survey of Pensa-
cola and Tampa Bays," or any part of the Resolution which gave
rise to it, except examining the Dry Tortugas, which I find totally
unfit for any kind of naval establishment. They consist of small
sand Islands a little above the surface of the Ocean, on some of which
is some low shrubbery, but are all liable to change from gales of wind.
Their insulated situation, and distance from the continent renders
blockade easy; they have a good inner harbour for small craft and a
tolerable outer one for ships of war; but they have no fresh water,

laws of the United States in the “Florida Intelligencer” Our press is
now in operation here, and a weekly paper will be published under
the above title as soon as the laws of the Territory are published,
which will be in a few weeks. The importance of the early promulga-

situation in the midst of a fertile country, far removed from the cities
in the extremes of the Territory, and from the fact, that this is the

D" SIR, I arrived here on the 15" inst. after a tedious passage of
eight days from S' Marks.—The goods were landed in fine order,
and are safely stored in care of M" Marsh.”—I have procured the
loan of one ox-team, and hired a party of discharged Soldiers, and one
or two Indian Negroes to open a road to the Agency; ” which I hope
to complete as early as the middle of February: by the end of which
month, I doubt not, to have the Annuity Articles ready on the spot
for delivery, as I shall move from here, with one load, in the Course
of six days.—I have already dispatched Runners, appointing the 1"
of March, for the Indians to meet and receive them.—But few emi-
grants have yet arrived in this quarter: one entire town however
(the Waka-sassa) has reached a point near Chickachatty, and made
a location: Chefixico Hajo, who it was said at S*Marks had stopped
near Oscilla, had (I am informed by one of his people, who is sent in
advance to make arraignments) crossed the Suanny by the first of
the Month: if this be true, he may be expected here daily.—I send
herewith enclosed, the notes of Lieut: Yancey,” adverted to, in my
letter of the 1* inst:" they were brought from Tallahasse by mistake.
I cannot but indulge the hope, that I shall shortly hear from you
favourably, in regard to the extension of the Northern Indian Bound-

to the U. States: an early communication upon this subject, is highly
important, as without it, I cannot make the necessary arraignments
for Building, and the Season is at hand, when preparations should be
entered into, for making Crops at the Agency, wherever it may be
finally located.”
I take the liberty here, to urge upon your attention the vast impor-
tance of the adoption of some regulations, by which the trade of the
Indians, can be confined within their Territory: without this, to

it to the Senate—
The Gentlemen of our Bar are generally of opinion, that the Legis-

Court, established by Congress; and have recommended the course
which we have adopted; but on this subject you will not require the
opinion of others; We merely mention this fact to account for the
request made in our memorial “That Congress will enact that the
Marshals shall be the only executive officers of the Superior Courts
in this Territory.”—
As a Counsellor at Law, you will no doubt be aware, that much
inconvenience, delay and embarrassment, must necessarily result
from there being several executive officers to the same Court, each
being independent of the other, and the jurisdiction of many extend-
ing over a small portion of the Judicial district—

HON. RICH* K. CALL,
SIR, I have had the honour of receiving a note from you," addressed
to me as U. S. Attorney for East Florida, and asking information
whether the Judge of the Superiour court of that district has ever
charged fees for services performed in his judicial capacity?
At the May term of the Superiour court of East Florida, in 1824,
Judge Smith established a number of rules for the government of the
practice of his court; by which provision is made for the transacting
and doing of much business in vacation, which previously had been
done in term; viz such as making orders for commissions to take
foreign testimony, & hearing and deciding on motions for amending
pleadings &c, and other matters and questions generally arising in the
usual progress of a suit. For all which services when performed,
Judge Smith has charged fees, I have paid them, and I believe every
attorney of his (Judge Smith) court, has done the same,
It is proper to mention that in United States and territorial cases,
Judge Smith has never charged fees,”

SIR,-A sense of duty, and as the only present means of remedying
the evil which now exists, I enclose you the following note from a very
worthy and patriotic member of the late Council of this Territory.
The laws of the Territory it is understood has undergone a general
revision, and all the former laws relating to the judiciary, it is under-
stood, have been repealed and new ones relating to that subject en-
acted; but there is no means of procuring copies thereof, unless from
Washington, where, it is known, they have been transmitted by the
Governor. Mr. Mitchel informed me verbally, that he endeavoured
to have a copy forwarded to the printer here but he could not succeed.
In the uncertain state in which we are, I submit, for the consideration
of the department whether it would not be beneficial to the public wel-
fare to cause a transcript to be made and forwarded to me, for publica-
tion in my paper se that
There is no intercourse between this and Tallahassee, which makes
it impossible to procure a manuscript copy of the laws from there.
Much needs to be done to enferee produce a vigorous execution of
the laws, and great energy and discretion is required in our public
officers. Men of patriotism and devotion to their country’s good
would soon bring Florida into notice and cultivation, by which means
the country would be enriched with its staples.

this I obtained no satisfactory answer—On further enquiry of a Gen”

dollars. and I’ll further agree to make the main Bridge across the St:
Sebastian agreably to your advertisement, connected with your ex-

SIR, I will agree to open the Road from Picolata to St: Augustine
for the Sum of fifteen hundred Dollars including the building of a
Bridge over the St: Sebastian's River, provided the Road goes into
the City by the Red house & four mile branch; or if it is made to cross
at Wiel's ferry for the same sum of fifteen hundred dollars so far as to
bring it to the edge of the Marsh where it there binds on the Lagoon,
the old causeway now there to be thoroughly repaired. I will also
build a bridge over the Lagoon to the Island and causeway said Island
to low water mark and on the other side of the river causeway it in like
manner, continuing the said road into the City from thence over the
small creek, for the additional sum of fifteen hundred dollars; but it is
to be understood that the main River is not to be bridged.—
It is now the wet season and upon a recent examination of this part
of the Road, I am convinced that the above sum of fifteen hundred
dollars is too low by one half at least for bringing the Road either by
the way of the Red house branch or to Wiel's ferry, both of which
routes I consider nearly the same labor, and I would not now under-
take either for less than the sum of three thousand dollars but having
first made you a proposal for the whole route from Ockolockoney to St:
Augustine supposing it would go into St: Augustine by the four mile
branch for fifteen thousand dollars and having already closed the con-
tract from Ockolockony to St: John's for thirteen thousand five
hundred dollars it has become a point of honor with me to keep good
my engagement to you by now continuing the road as I first proposed
for the Sum of fifteen hundred dollars although I must sink money by
so doing.—

You will perceive from the Proclamation for the sale of the Lands
embraced in the diagram forwarded by you,” that the sales will not
take place until the 3" Monday in May. As I presume your Deputy
Surveyors will all attend these sales, you will be furnished with drafts
on the Receiver at Tallahassie to enable you to discharge the claims
for Surveying. I have however to request that you will furnish your

that will be required to discharge the claims for Surveying that will be
executed previous to the 3" Monday in May.”

I should have found it my duty to reject your proposition for that

the Road to be opened from Picolata to St: Augustine either by the
way of the “Red house & four mile branch” or by “Wiel's Ferry,”
you still wish your offers to be taken up. Your offers to open it by
either of the routes named therein are lower than any others made to
me, and being reasonable will in that case be accepted as a matter of

SIR, In consequence of your letter I consider my proposal for
making the road as relinquished, I cannot hereafter be in a situation
to undertake the work to so much advantage; It would have been a
losing business at any rate especially by the four mile branch.—
My proposal for making the road and Bridge jointly is to remain in
force, and if there should not be funds to meet the expense I will
undertake to complete it without delay, on condition that I be paid
for the Road, say $ 4500, leaving the remainder $.5500. for building
the Bridge, to be paid for when funds are appropriated. I shall expect
however in that case your assurance that every proper representation
shall be made through your Department to obtain the appropriation at
the next session of Congress.-
If the Road is made by the way of Pepino's with a view to the
establishment of a ferry I will agree to make it for $.4000, as proposed
in my letter of the 9", and if with a view to a bridge for $.4500, some
more work being necessary to fix the causeway at the ends of the
Bridge than for a ferry.”
If it crosses at any point within 400 yds, above the stockades I will
make the Road and build the Bridge for $.8000. And if it goes into
Town by the way of the Red house and four mile branch I shall ask
four thousand five hundred dollars.”—

It will now be necessary to have two interpreters, one for the
Indians who have been removed South and one for the Appalachicola

attend to both. The Indians residing on the Appalachicola river are
fast improving in the arts and agriculture—I request that the amount
which has usually been allowed to be expended (in procuring the
portraits of distinguished warriors) by other superintendents may be
allowed to me Oren Marsh who has been acting for some months past
as sub. Indian Agent under me, has discharged his duty faithfully
and I hope his appointment will be confurmed,” I consider it necessary

Mar. 2, and Walton was informed on Apr. 8 that a requisition for that sum had
been issued in his favor (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 1). Other correspondence
relative to provisioning the Indians during 1825, which was done under contract
with Benjamin Chaires, is printed in House Report 74, 19 Cong., 1 sess., and in

supplied under this contract. He submitted the matter to the Secretary of War
on Aug. 6, 1826, claiming that he was owed $31,025.82 for rations, and that he
had applied unsuccessfully to Gov. DuVal for payment; he further stated that
$5,205 was due him for cattle furnished to the Indians (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd.,
Fla.). In response to a request from McKenney of Oct. 23 for an explanation,
the Governor communicated on Nov. 15 that the matter had been attended to by
the Secretary during his absence in 1825, and that the accounts had been taken
by him to Washington (loc. cit.).

D* SIR I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of 20th Decemb" last.”
You will have received long Since the diagram of the Townships
intended for the first Sale,” having forwarded it in December—The
Surveys agreeably to that diagram are Completed with the exception
of Township 1 Range 5, South and East, which has been found an
impassable Swamp at this Season, owing to the high waters and per-
haps affording much of the water which makes the Oscilla–Three
large Lakes have been Meandered; and in the one Called Hiamonia
there has been Surveyed 40 Islands of various Sizes, the largest be-
tween 1 and 2 hundred Acres, and the land generally of excellent
quality, Surrounded by a Sheet of Clear living water—The protrac-
tions and Calculations of the fractional Sections bounding on those
Lakes will be a Serious undertaking, being So extremely irregular—I
had Contemplated at one time of having these Lakes Surveyed in Ac-
cordance with the plat furnished by your directions, but I find it in-
expedient to do So, for the reason above mentioned, as it would cut
up the adjoining Sections without any Salutary effect.
There remains a few fractional Sections on the Ockolockonny river
to Complete in their meanders which could not be effected heretofore
from high waters
Since the arrival of the Stationary from New Orleans we have been
engaged assiduously and Shall be enabled to forward by the Middle
of Next Month the returns of the 23 Townships
I shall this day despatch a Surveyor of great experience to run the
Boundary line as directed by your letter,” and I would Suggest for
your Consideration the reservation from Sale of all the fractions made
by my Surveys on the line run by the State of Georgia, with a view to
their extention to the true line, which I apprehend will be the fact.

* This task was assigned to Daniel F. McNeil, who performed the survey in the

some enquiry and find the Fort and buildings to be in possession of a

privilege, We would be willing to pay an equevolent rent, and become
responsible for any damage, or come under any obligation which may
be prescribed, As the thing now stands the whole is public property
there is no other place of Landing goods and the person in possession
will neither give liberty to use a Ware house or to build one. Should
it be consistant with the rules and regulations of your department to
grant such a privilege I would feel under many obligations for it.”

Supplies could be obtained, several of my men very lame, from wad-

I obtained some dried venison in all about four days rations for the
party—I could obtain no information of the Country South every one
declared they knew nothing of the Country, Some Indians had been
through during the dry season, but represented it as entirely imprac-

way into the Harbour I procured two Perougues with some Spaniards
and run up the River about five miles, and floated my Horses and
mules over, where the river was about one and a half miles in width,

Horses broke down near Charlotte river, I was Compelled to leave

SIR I have the honor to enclose herewith an Estimate of the
probable Amount of funds necessary for opening the road to Charlotte
Harbour, One hundred and twenty seven miles—
It is very difficult to form an Estimate for Opening a road through
Such a Country as that between Tolockchopco or Peace River and
Charlotte Harbour, it must be Causewayed and thrown up with deep
ditches for near thirty Miles and in many places the Timber hauled
some distance I believe My Estimate a very reasonable one Judging
from the appearance of the Country as I passed through it, No Sup-
plies, not even Grass Can be obtained through any part of the Country
below Tolockchopco or Peace river, the Supplies for opening the road
can be taken up Manatee and Tolockchopco Rivers in Barges, and
into Charlotte Harbour in Vessels."
I have the Honor to be Sir with great respect your Obt Servt.

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS
OF EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 18 Cong., 2 sess.: DS]
[Referred February 21, 1825]
To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States in Congress assembled.—
The petition of the Subscribers resident inhabitants of the eastern
district of Florida respectfully sheweth
That in virtue of the acts of Congress for the establishment of a
Territorial government in Florida, a Marshal of the United States
has been appointed by the President, as the executive officer of the
Superior Court throughout this district—and by an act of the Legis-
lative Council of this Territory approved June 29* 1823 it is declared
that the Marshals of the Territory in addition to the duties assigned
them by the laws of the United States shall be the executive officers
of the Territorial branch of the Superior Courts within their respective
districts;" that the present Marshal for this District, has in virtue
of the aforesaid acts of Congress, and the declaritory act of the
Legislative Council, hitherto discharged all the duties of the executive
officer of the said Superior Court in this district, and given great

satisfaction in the exercise of his office; that by an act of the Legisla-
tive Council at their late session at Tallahasse, the said act of the
29* June 1823 has been repealed, and it has been enacted that “All
business confided to the Marshals of this Territory, shall be trans-
ferred to the Sheriffs of the respective Counties in which the business
belongs”" Your petitioners respectfully represent, that the multipli-
cation of officers to the Superior Court (if the Legislative Council
have authority to do so) will be productive of great inconvenience to
the inhabitants of this district and occasion much embarrassment
in the administration of Justice—The many evils which would result
from the operation of this act, to an extensive and thinly populated
district are so manifest, that your petitioners deem it unnecessary to
enumerate them—but as your petitioners firmly believe that it was
intended by the Act of Congress aforesaid, that the Marshals should
be the sole executive officers of the Superior Courts, and that the
Legislative Council of this Territory have no right to assign the
duties thereof to the Sheriffs who are mere county officers—Your
Petitioners therefore pray that Congress will pass a declaritory act
on this subject—or repeal the act of the Legislative Council passed
at their late session *—And your petitioners as in duty bound will
ever pray—

Feb'y 22, 1825.
GENL R. K. CALL House of Represent
SIR I have examined the claims of Fernando Morino, Juan Domin-
quez, and Philip Prieto, which you left with me a few days ago,
&regret that they are yet deficient in the evidence necessary to warrant
their payment.—
The first objection stated against those claims in my letter to you of
the 26" April last,” may be considered as removed, since the confir-
mation by Congress, of the titles to the land on which the damages
are alleged to have occurred, generally follows as matter of course,
on the favorable report of the commissioners. But there is no evi-
dence adduced, tending to remove the other objections stated. It
will occur to you as important to be shown, that the damages assessed
were in fact committed by the United States troops—that the arbi-
trators were duly appointed by the claimants & the public agent—and
that they acted under the obligation of an oath. If the timber was,
as I presume, cut by authority, & under the direction of an officer
for building purposes, a certificate to that effect, stating also, that the
extent of the depredations thus committed, had been correctly pointed
out to the arbitrators on the ground, should be produced. The
paper constituting the arbitrators in the cases, & their regular quali-
fications being then annexed, the claims would be in a fit condition
to be paid.
The papers are herewith returned to you—and I would advise you
to present them with this letter, to Captain Burch at Pensacola, who
will be able to point out the form of proceeding, and who will no
doubt pay them himself on the production of the additional evidence

SIR! I have the honor of transmitting to you a Correspondence be-
tween the City Council of this place, and Captain Burch relative to
the mode of terminating the public Road at S*Augustine—We trust
that the Governm" having munificently expended a large sum for
the purpose of facilitating the intercourse between Pensacola & this
City, will not terminate the work by imposing upon us, an incon-
venience instead of an accommodation which it would certainly do,
by the establishment of an expensive ferry near the town, when a
commodious bridge may be constructed at a less cost. The land is
so poor on each side of the Creek where the Road is to cross, that it
would not maintain a family; and whoever therefore undertakes to
attend the ferry must be supported at the public expence:—many other
considerations might be submitted, but we rest satisfied, that the
government will be induced on the score of oeconomy, with a view to
the completion of the objects of the Road,—to authorize the construc-
tion of a Bridge in the manner suggested by the council to Captain
Burch 18–

the opinion you have expressed on the subject. We beg leave to
suggest, that as the accommodation of Pensacola, and S*Augustine,
and the opening of a free intercourse between these two points, was
the leading object of the government, in authorizing the laying out
and construction of the road in question, and that therefore the estab-
lishment of Bridges in the most convenient situations, and where they
are essentially necessary, must form an important portion of the
improvement contemplated by the Act of Congress. We would then
Sir submit, whether a ferry at the point alluded to, will not contravene
the evident object of the Government, in as much as the tolls which
must be collected for its support, will prove a perpetual tax on the
citizens of this place, and all who visit it, and whether the great
high-way about to be formed, should not be completed with an
especial view to the accommodation of the cities which it was meant
to benefit; and be made the means of an immediate advantage to
them. Congress we presume, will not withhold any appropriation
necessary for the completion of the essential object which it has so
munificently began, but which we conceive will not be completed, but
on the contrary must imperfectly terminated by the establishment of
an expensive and inconvenient Ferry, when a Bridge which will afford
an accommodation, to which the expense of the construction will
bear no proportion, can be readily built in its stead.—The navigation
will admit of the materials being conveniently floated to the spot,
and the labourers necessary for the work, can be readily obtained in
the vecinity. The Act of congress being public, and opened to
the interpretation of all, we have not hesitated to submit to you the
foregoing views, trusting that you will put a liberal construction
upon our motives and objects—
We remain, with respect Y Most Ob" Servants—

The Committee, as at present informed, are not able to perceive
how any law of the Territory can authorize the Judge to receive any
compensation in the shape of fees, for his official services in the place
which he holds under the authority of the United States—The distance
of the parties, however, from the seat of Government, renders it wholly

* The opening of land offices in East and West Florida, to which were to be
appointed registers and receivers, was provided for by sects. 8 and 9 of the act
approved Mar. 3, 1823 (3 STAT. 756). Overton was nominated for the appoint-
ment as register on Feb. 14, 1825, and confirmed on Feb. 16 (Senate, Exec. Journal,
III, 413, 415). He did not serve long in this position. See post, p. 253. During
several preceding years a number of applications had been received for appoint-
ments to land offices in Florida (NA, SD, Applications). On behalf of George
Walton, Sen. John Elliott (Ga.) wrote the President, Feb. 16, 1821, recommending
him for receiver. John W. Overton, of Nashville, Tenn., was recommended to
the President for appointment as register or receiver by Rep. Newton Cannon
(Tenn.), Feb. 26, 1821. John Rodman, of New York, applied to the President
for an appointment as register, Mar. 8, 1821. Thomas Mitchell, of Athens, Ga.,
applied to Josiah Meigs, Commissioner of the General Land Office, for appoint-
ment as surveyor general, register, or receiver, Mar. 24, 1821, and Stevens Thomas,
of the same place, wrote to the same official recommending Mitchell, Mar. 24,
1821. Joseph Hutchinson, of Augusta, Ga., was recommended to the President
for register or receiver by Sen. Nicholas Ware (Ga.) and Rep. Robert R. Reid
(Ga.), Apr. 29, 1822. Gov. DuVal recommended Craven P. Luckett to the
President for register at Tallahassee, Sept. 29, 1824. J. Woodruff, a former
officer of the Army, wrote Andrew Jackson from Charleston, Feb. 16, 1821,
asking his support in obtaining an appointment as receiver or land commissioner
in E. Fla. where he wanted to develop a plantation (LC, Jackson Papers, Vol. 58).
A number of other letters to George Graham are to be found in NA(GLO,
Misc. Lets. Recd.). One from Walter Taylor, of Lunenberg Co., Va., stated his
brother was an applicant, July 7, 1824. Luckett was also recommended by
Joseph M. White for an appointment in the Territory, particularly as register,
Oct. 15, 1824. For the position of receiver in W. Fla., John P. DuVal was recom-
mended by John Spence, of Dumfries, Nov. 29, 1824. Edwin R. Alberti, a
lieutenant in the U.S. Army, applied for appointment as register or receiver in
E. Fla., Dec. 9, 1824. An application from James Williams, of Port Deposit,
Md., Jan. 28, 1825, expressed an interest in the position of register or receiver.
It was evidently the intention of the Government to appoint land officers for
E. Fla. at this time, for on Feb. 28, 1825, G. W. Ward, of Florida, was nominated
for the appointment as register for E. Fla. and Moses Green, of Va., for that of
receiver. Both nominations were laid on the table on Mar. 3 (Senate, Exec.
Journal, III, 421,427).

he will be permitted to take a body of land Six miles Square; taking
care that the lines are run to the Cardinal points, and the subdivisions
made in conformity to the mode of subdividing of the Public lands
This mode of locating the land will increase the number of fractional
Townships when the adjacent lands are Surveyed.

WASHINGTON March 2d 1825
Since I have been the District attorney of East Florida, it has been
frequently mentioned in my presence, (and I have been satisfied of
the truth of the statement) that in the District of East Florida many
trespasses have been and now are committing on the public lands, for
the purpose of cutting timber, the preservation of which is particularly
important to the government, as you must be convinced. As the law
officer of the United States for that District, I would have taken steps
to arrest the trespasses I have alluded to, but for the peculiar circum-
stances and situation of Florida as it respects the soil and the interests
of the inhabitants of that territory, which I will relate to you, and of
which you are perhaps not unacquainted and unadvised. The tres-
passes on the public land are now becoming so common, and the con-
sequent destruction of public timber so great, that I should be wanting
in my duty, were I not to call your attention to this subject, with the
hope that you may suggest a remedy and that I may be advised from
the department of which you are a member how I shall I act in this
business, and after I have laid before you the reasons which have
heretofore induced me not to take any measures to prevent the depre-
dations complained of, you will perceive the case is not without diffi-
culties. In the Eastern section of Florida, nearly three millions of
acres of land, are claimed by individuals as private property. These
private claims are scattered over the whole surface of East Florida
some of them are of small and moderate extent, others are of the most
astonishing magnitude All of the above claims, (with one or two ex-
ceptions) emenated from the Spanish government, and are very varied
in character &c. Some were made absolute and unconditional, the
rest were upon some conditions and with restrictions, which by a part
of the claimants have been observed and complied with, while others
have totally disregarded them or else have conformed to so limited a
degree, that their titles to say the least are very exceptionable. Of

the absolute grants made by or purporting to have been by the
Spanish government, many are questionable on the ground that the
Spanish authorities transcended their power in making them and that
they are forged and fraudulent. Some of these grants, even when
absolute, are without a location, and where there are locations and
surveys, the same are so vague and undefined, that often, the most
experienced would be at a loss to designate the spot called for by the
survey. A board of Commissioners have been appointed to decide
upon the merit & validity of the above claims, & although that board
has been diligently employed in the discharge of the duties assigned
them, yet they still have to determine many principles of Spanish law
affecting land titles in E. Florida and after they shall have done this,
still each case will have to be settled by the commissioners, as the
evidence adduced by the claimant may and frequently gives his claim
a new and different aspect and induces the commissioners to confirm
what they had resolved to reject. Hence the difficulty is, that should
persons be sued for trespassing on lands claimed by grants not yet
confirmed by the land Commissioners, the title would be tried by a
tribunal different from the one intended by Congress, and where the
title has been confirmed but the location not defined by the Commis-
sioners, enable the party to locate his land grant in a manner different
from what the law may intend and hereafter point out, and should
any harsh remedies be resorted to, many innocent persons may be
injured and perhaps ruined thereby.
I am afraid you will find this communication very crude and un-
satisfactory, it has been written in great hurry, as I I have to leave
Washington this morning, but it will afford me great pleasure to give
you any information you may wish on this subject, and which it is in

SIR, Since my letter to you of the 22" Ultimo;” I have seen Cap'
Clark of the Q Masters department, who left Tampa Bay, some weeks
since, for the purpose of Surveying a route for a road to Cape Sable:
after progressing as far as Charlotte Harbor, he was obliged to return
for want of provisions: he states however, his belief that the route
would not have been practicable much farther, and that he would have
been Compelled, oweing to the marshiness of the Country to return;
even had not his supplies failed. I mention this for the purpose of
exhibiting to you a Correct idea of the Character of that portion of the
Territory assigned to the Indians under the Treaty Concluded at
Moultrie Creek."
The principle object however of this Communication is to perform
what I deem to be a duty. in reporting Certain facts detailed to me by
Cap" Clark in relation to some of the Fisheries established on the
Florida Coast and particularly those about Charlotte Harbour which
appear to require early attention. It is ascertained beyond a doubt,
that through the medium of these establishments, a Constant inter-
course is kept up, between the Indians of this Territory and the Island
of Cuba, it is a very Common thing for the Indians (sometimes the
Chiefs) to make visits in the Wessels belonging to the Fishery to the
Havanna, where they are welcomed by the public Authorities of the
Island, and when ready to depart, are sent away loaded with presents,
the injurious tendency of such a state of things is easily immagioned—
Through the same Channel, Spirituous liquors are regularly intro-
duced among the Indians, who do not hesitate to say, that they Can
obtain it at any time, by a visit to the Fisheries.
In fact Jumper, one of the principle men of the Southern Indians
told Cap" Clark, who saw him at Charlotte Harbor, that he was then

WASHINGTON CITY March 5th 1825.
HON” SAMUEL. L. SOUTHWARD Secretary of the Navy
SIR It is important, to the ef the United States, that some
effectual measures, should be speedily taken, to preserve the ship-tim-
ber in the Territory of Florida.
The Navy of the United States, (if it is not at this moment) will
soon be dependant on Florida for the live oak and red cedar so essential
to its existence. A great waste in a short time, has been committed
on the Publick timber, so much so, as to satisfy me, that the utmost
attention & vigilence is required to preserve it. Allow me to suggest
that some person should be appointed to visit S*Andrews bay and the
coast of Florida and report on the lands best timbered which should
be reserved for the use of the Navy—All squatters who may be on the
lands reserved should be immediately removed, for these settlers dis-
troy much of the best wood, by belting the trees. In order to prevent
shipment of valuable timber and to prevent Smuggling on the Florida
coast, three revenue Cutters will be necessary for such an extent of
sea-board. One should cruise along the coast from Pensacola to
Charlotte habour, another should be station’d at Key West, which
should ply round Cape Florida, from Charlotte river on west, to
Indian River on the East of the cape,; the third should be stationed at
the mouth of St Johns river, to cruise to the mouth of Indian river.
This is the only effectual measure that can be adopted to secure,
the shiptimber and to suppress smuggling.
Their is no part of our coast, so exposed as Florida ahd or which
presents so many little rivers, inlets, and bays, remote from, our
settlements—If an organized system of smuggling, is once fully in
operation, it will cost much time, trouble, and expence to suppress it.
If measures are, taken in due time, much revenue will be secured to
the Government, and the most valuable shiptimber preserved which
if distroyed nature will not replace in an age. If you should deem
it advisable to appoint an agent to examine the Florida coast for the
purpose of reporting to the government the particular tracts of land,
best timbered, and convenient to the Gulph of Mexico, permit me, to
recommend the Hon." Timothy Twitchel of Pensacola, as best qualli-
fied from his knowledge of ship building and of the coast, to execute
this trust—This gentleman has information, experience, activity and
honestty *

sold live oak to the amount of about five hundred Dollars from a
tract of land which was petitioned for many years before the session
of Florida to the United States for a mill seat; a grant was ordered
by the Spanish government on the petitioner complying with certain
conditions, & two of the land commissioners inform me, that no one
of the Conditions have been performed: I went on the land for the
purpose of forbidding the person to whom D Hall had sold the
Timber from cutting it—as the title is in the U. States; the Timber
however had been felled and Doct' Hall had received Two
hundred and fifty Dollars on account—I directed the Contractor not
to pay any further sum to Hall until it was ascertained if he had a
title to the land—
I have just stopped persons from cutting on a nother tract of land
similarly situated—and have been threatened with prosecutions for
interfering—I did consider it my duty to interfere, where I saw
persons disposing of timber from lands, evidently belonging to the
United States—the individual claims to which cannot be sustained—
In the Case of Hall and Timber was cut down before I arrived on the
land, I did not feel myself authorised to go further than to direct
that no further payment should be made to him—
I do not know if I am authorised to interfere in this business—and
will thank you to instruct me on the subject—and if this communica-
tion is not properly addressed to you—that you will be pleased to
refer it to the officer who is authorised to give instructions on the
subject—I am convinced that since the session of Florida to the
United States, much valuable Timber has been sold by persons who
had no claim either in law or equity—

* Claggett was nominated on Feb. 26, 1825, to take the place of William F.
Steele, who had been removed; the nomination was ordered to lie on the table on
Mar. 3; consideration was resumed on Mar. 9, when he was confirmed (Senate
Exec. Journal, III, 418, 426,445). On Mar. 9 is entered a further nomination of
Claggett for the same position and an order that it lie on the table (ibid., p. 447).
Since the commission was recorded, his nomination was evidently regarded as
confirmed. Neither the transmittal letter nor an acknowledgement has been
found. That he served in the position is shown by salary payments authorized
by the First Auditor of the Treasury for the quarter from Mar. 9 to June 8
and from June 9 to Sept. 8, 1825 (NA, GAO, Misc. Treas. Accts., Nos. 49046,
49272). See post, p. 349.
7 Various applications and recommendations relative to this position had also
been received. Sen. Richard M. Johnson (Ky.) recommended Samuel R. Overton
(Memoirs of J. Q. Adams, VI, 284, Apr. 8, 1824), and in an undated letter to the
Sec. of State recommended John Overton and Craven P. Luckett (NA, SD, Fla.
Terr. Papers, XI). Adam Gordon was recommended to the Sec. of State by
Joseph M. White, William Sebree, and John Miller, Sept. 9, 1824 (loc. cit.).
Thomas Douglas, of Madison, Ind., was recommended by Gov. William Hendricks
(Ind.) in a letter of Dec. 31, 1824, to Sen. James Noble (Ind.) who, along with
Sen. Waller Taylor (Ind.), Rep. William McLean (Ohio), Rep. Jonathan Jennings
(Ind.), and Rep. John Test (Ind.), wrote the President, Jan. 27, 1825 (NA, SD,
Applications). James Webb, a recent settler in Jackson Co., W. Fla., solicited
the aid of Sen. Thomas W. Cobb (Ga.), Jan. 12, 1825. Webb's letter with a
recommendation was forwarded to the Sec. of State, Feb. 10, 1825 (loc. cit.).
R. H. Mosby, of Petersburg, Va., enquired of the same official, June 27, 1825,
concerning an application he had made (loc. cit).

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File: LS]
PENSACOLA, March 10, 1825
GENERAL, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of 22" December * & 2" Feb’ last.”—Last summer I was
informed of the mule reported in M* Sykes letter to Gen' Gaines, by
a man who wished to purchase it, but as I knew of no stray mule
belonging to the Q M* Department, I could not sell.—There is some
mistake about it; the mule in question must have strayed from movers,
& perhaps being at the same time the troops were in that Country
the inhabitants supposed it belonged to them.—I had a mule injured
by a fall near the Conecuh River, which eventually caused its death,
as will be seen by my accounts for the last quarter.—
The troops have crossed the Choctawhatchie River with the Mili-
tary Road and are now at work between that and the Appalachicola.—
Their progress has been greatly retarded by the continued falls of
Rain during the past winter, which have literally flooded the Country;
indeed it is a matter of Surprise to me that all the causeways &
bridges have not been washed up. As it is, although none are broken
up, yet very considerable repairs, principally renewing the covering
of earth on the Causeways in the Swamps, will have to be done by
the troops on their return march.—If I had ever seen the lands of
Florida so much inundated as they are now, in my first estimate
instead of $51,000. I should have laid it at the least at $100,000.—
The delays occasioned by the wet weather and the additional work
rendered necessary together will cause an expense of 33 per cent
advance upon my first calculations for the labor of the troops.—I
hope however yet to be able to get through with the sums now appro-
priated. It is safest I have always found to calculate the cost of a
work after it is finished, so many unexpected contingencies, impossible
to foresee or to prevent if forseen, continually arise to defeat the most
prudent calculations. However I feel Confident that as it regards
NA (HF, Orig. Reports, TD, Land Claims in E. Fla., 19 Cong., 1 sess.). The
reports are printed in H. Doc. 115, 19 Cong., 1 sess., and reprinted in A. S. P., Pub.
Lands, IV, 561–748, with accompanying documents relative to land claims, which
are also to be found in the GLO records. The minutes of the proceedings of the
commissioners, covering Mar. 28 to Dec. 30, 1825, are printed ibid., pp. 576-596.
The records of the board are preserved in the Florida State Department of Agri-
culture, Tallahassee, Fla., and can be found listed in the inventory cited ante,

expenses the General is assured I shall use all possible economy, and
also is fully aware of the casualties that attend the execution of works
whether by individuals for their private benefit, or in the hands of
agents for the public. It is the opinion of practical men here that
less than $30,000, would not have defrayed the expense of opening
the Road to Choctawhatchie by hired workmen—that calculation
however is large, yet much work has been done; numerous small
bridges have been built, & also two large Bridges over rapid streams,
the one about 330 feet long, and the other 250 feet with about three
hundred yards of Causeway.—I have found good mechanics among
the Soldiers, which obviates the necessity & expense of employing
Citizens to construct Bridges.—
My accounts for the last quarter will be transmitted by the next
mail—
The original Contracts for the Road will be forwarded so soon as
I have taken Copies; as also all others in my possession.” I was not
aware of the necessity of forwarding the originals, but supposed they
were to be retained in the Office here until accomplished.”—

South and East reported it impracticable, being all under water.
For the want of necessary Stationary on my arrival, I was under the
necessity of dispensing with Contracts, for these Townships and had
them Surveyed under Special instructions, Copies of which Can be
forwarded if required—the Acct” of the Deputies accompanying my
general accounts for the Quarters ending 31* Dec 1824, and 31st
inst, herewith enclosed,” will perhaps be Sufficient Satisfaction—You
* These township plats are preserved in the Department of the Interior, Bureau
of Land Management, Washington, D. C. The plats are extremely valuable for
the history of public land surveying in Florida and for local history. They
show the areas of public lands and private land claims surveyed with the
quantities of land, and the names of the surveying parties. Besides displaying
the physical features of the country, as prescribed by the surveying regulations,
they present valuable information relative to the names of settlers, the loca-
tions of tracts, the routes of roads, and the location of forts. Filed with the
pertinent township plats are diagrams of surveys of private land claims. The
file of original township plats is in Tallahassee, Fla., in the custody of the Florida
State Department of Agriculture, Field Note Division, to which the records of
the Surveyor General of Florida were transferred in 1908 upon the closing of his
office.
* The field notes are also preserved in Washington and in Tallahassee in the
custodies mentioned above. They present details relative to the operations of the
deputy surveyors and their helpers in running township boundaries and section
lines. They are essential records for the history of public land surveying in
Florida.

have also enclosed the Contracts” made with the Deputys for the
Surveys now under progress—By reference to Township 2 Range 1
N° & West you will observe the meanders of the Ockalockany river
are not taken; this deficiency exists from that river overflowing its
banks throughout the winter and Still too high to effect that
object—
I shall have it effected before the Sale if practicable, otherwise it
will Suggest itself to your mind to reserve the Sections on its borders
from Sale until it shall be Surveyed. That river was So narrow in
Township 3, Range 1 N° and West, that it was deemed advisable to
run the Section lines over it, -this Township has from recent informa-
tion about 3 Small islands in the arm of the Harmonia Lake running
into it, but I have not been enabled to detach a Surveyor to meander
them,-The quality of the Islands in the Harmonia Lake, added to
its beauty, will will render them desireable in the eyes of purchasers
in that vacinity.
Permit me again to draw your attention to the Subject of funds for
the purpose of paying off the Deputies, as a large portion of the
Contracts will be Completed in April, and they have manifested a
Strong hope to be able to return to their respective homes, as soon
thereafter as possible.
I have likewise enclosed you my Account for Salaries, which
together with the balance due me on the General Account, I will be
more than obliged to you to remit me as Soon as possible, I shall want
it at the land Sales.
I Contemplate arranging my business to enable me to leave for
Tennessee immediately after the land Sales, with a view to remove my
family the ensuing fall and the returns of the Surveys now in progress,
will during my absence be So arranged and forwarded as to enable
me to report them in a few weeks after my return.
I shall be pleased to learn that my first essay in this department,
has been executed in a manner Satisfactory to you, and Shall be
thankful for the Communication of any improvements that may
Suggest themselves on examination *-

March 15th 1825
THE HON: BERNARDO SEGUI Mayor of St Augustine Florida
SIR Your letter to the Secretary of War dated the 22" Ult” ”
covering a copy of a correspondence with Captain Dan' E. Burch
“relative to the mode of terminating the public road at St Augustine”,
has been referred to this office; and I regret that the appropriation for
the road is so small as to put it entirely out of my power to authorize
the erecting of a Bridge over the St Sebastians how desirable soever
it might be to do so. The road from Pensacola to St Augustine was
authorized by Congress with a view of affording a direct communica-
tion between important military posts, and of facilitating the settle-
ment of the interior of Florida.—Most of the lands through which it
will pass belongs to the public, and in making the appropriation,
Congress acted upon the general principle that the proprietor of the
land is bound to make the road.
Should Congress think proper to authorize the building of a bridge
over the St: Sebastians, and make an adequate appropriation, it
would afford me great pleasure to carry their views into effect in a
manner the most satisfactory to the Citizens of St: Augustine: but
until that be done I have no authority to act, for I have no right to
make engagements on public account not authorized by actual
appropriations.”

JAMES WILLIAMS Esq" near Port Deposit, MaryLand.
SIR, I am directed by the Secretary to acknowledge the receipt of
your Letter of the 10" instant to him,” and to inform you that it is
not the present purpose of the Executive to open a Land Office in
East Florida or make appointments for such an Office immediately—
Indeed, from the late Presidents having made nominations for these
appointments which were not acted upon during the Session,” it is a
little doubtful whether he has authority now to make them.
I am, Sir, respectfully, your obedient humble Servant.

Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12
Feb. * advising of the receipt of mine of the 20 Dec last,” and am
much obliged to you for the information it contains—The Surveys of
the 23 Townships advertised for sale in May will I hope be received at
this Office in due time.
Your decision to commence the traverse at the junction of Flint
& Chatahoochie is correct.
I have this day given instructions to the Land Officers to reserve
from Sale the fractional Sections binding on the supposed line of
Georgia, or the adjacent Sections, if it should be found that the line
of Georgia is further south than you have heretofore supposed
The appropriation for the present year will authorize the Surveying
of one hundred complete Townships in Florida, exclusive of the amount

GENTLEMEN As the true Northern boundary line of Florida was
not accurately ascertained when the Townships advertised for sale
in May next were surveyed, I have to request that you will reserve
from sale, the Fractional sections lying adjacent to the North bound-
ary line of Florida, as laid down in these Townships respectively; in
order that such frac' sections may be extended, if the true line should
be further North, as is presumed to be the fact. Should Co! Butler
however receive such information as may induce him to believe, that
the Northern boundary line will be further South than he has ex-
tended the present surveys, you will in that case reserve from sale
also the tier of sections lying South of the fr’ sections above mentioned,
so as to prevent the sale of any lands that may by possibility fall
within the limits of Georgia. You will also reserve from sale, a sec-
tion of land adjacent to the lands, which have been selected by the
Lieutenant Governor of Florida, for the seat of Government; * the
reserve to be * made in quarter sections Contiguous to the above
mentioned lands, & so situated as may comport with the extension of
the Town already laid out.”

SIR. The preservation of live Oak Timber is an object of great
importance to the future interests of the Navy; and fears are enter-
tained, that much of the most valuable in Florida, will be destroyed,
if immediate measures be not taken to secure it. I have therefore to
propose, that an Agent be appointed to examine that country, and
report to the Department, on the quality, quantity, and location of
it, with the best means of securing, and preserving it. Timothy
Twitchel Esq., has been represented to me, as a fit person, and it is
supposed that he can examine, and report before the next Session of
Congress. The expense would probably amount to Four or Five
hundred dollars, and might be paid out of the Contingent Appropria-
tion of the Navy."

preparing such instructions to M. T. as he supposes most useful—
The guide to be given to M T. in determining what land belongs to

Wherever they have decided land to belong to an individual it is
best so to consider & report upon it—cabbage tree or palmetto.

* This date is from the auditor's report, which was written on the abstract and shows that $289.23 was due to Butler. William
Parker, the auditor, also attached the following note: “Mr Butler should be requested not to enter Fractions of Cents in his Accounts—
And it would probably be proper to inform him that he has uselessly extended the fractions of Miles in his Accounts to Seven places of
decimals, when two or at most three, would be as many as are Useful in his Accounts.”

Augustine addressed to the officers of this post, among them were
several from the Qr. M. Genr"Office addressed to me. The Indian

them to this place assuring him that he would receive his pay on his

the discharge of my official duties, by acting immediately on those
claims. The decission of the Commissioners, to which much respect
is due, will have the desired tendency of settling the most important
points and difficulties connected with private land titles in this
district, and the officers of government will be enabled to distinguish
with much more certainty, the property belonging to the United
States. In the course of a few days, I calculate that the Com-
missioners, by the decissions I have called for, will have removed the
obstacles that might have embarrassed me in this business.
The presence of the Cutters, you spoke of in your letter, will I hope
have a beneficial effect, the adoption of this measure was urged upon
government by Govr. Duval during his visit at Washington, last
winter. The officers of these vessels, are I believe, appointed by the
President on the nomination of the Secretary of the Treasury. Permit
me to solicit your good offices to procure from the Secretary the com-
mand of one of the cutters for Capn. John Whalton of St Augustine.
An intimate acquaintance with this gentleman, who has resided here,
a number of years, enables me to speak with confidence of his standing
as a gentleman of honourable feelings integrity and intelligence. Of
his skill in seamanship and navigation I can say nothing of my own
knowledge, being ignorant of such things, but reputation assigns him
a character of being highly and eminently qualified and skilled in them,
as also for being an active and enterprizing sailor. No one can be
selected, who has a more perfect knowledge of this coast than Capn
Whalton, he was for a long time engaged in the navigation of the
neighbouring seas, and when employed by Capn Ramage of the U. S.
Navy as pilot to the vessels engaged in making a survey of the Florida
coast, I am authorised to say that he gave the most entire satisfaction.
Capn Whalton has claims upon our government, he had resided in
Florida a few years previous to the exchange of flags, and by his very
gentlemanly deportment and an intermarriage with an amiable and
interesting Spanish lady, acquired considerable influence with the
native Floridians which was constantly and often successfully exerted
in adjusting and quieting the many broils that originated between the
Americans and Spaniards and conciliating the latter towards our
government, and when the yellow fever, that prevailed here in 1821,
was raging to an extent that proved fatal to so many of our country-
men, this gentleman and his whole family were among the few, that did
not shrink from visiting the sick bed of the stranger and administering
that relief & consolation which could not have been claimed even from
the hand of friendship. Govr. Duval & Gen Call have on various
occassions furnished to some of the departments, the most flattering
testimonials of this Captain Whalton, & have reeehahaead recom-
mended him for an employment and command of a cutter—And as in

TALLAHASSEE April 21 1825.
DEAR SIR, I have been here since the 7, but the woods are so rotten
that I have made but little progress in examining the Country—from
what I have seen however with the concurrent opinions of all those
who are best informed on the subject, I have no doubt but I will
select the first Township North in Range 1 East—in point of soil it is
superior to any other Township I have seen or heard of and its vicinity
to this place adds much to is value-As far as I have examined it I
have seen no land that may not be cultivated to advantage and a great
portion of it first rate—we have not had three fair days since I arrived,
yesterday was very fine and I went over several sections, if the
weather continues as it now promises I think I will be able to satisfy
myself fully in ten days or two weeks.—The greatest objection I see
to the country is the extraordinary number of Ponds that abound
thro all the rich lands—many of them abetted with furnish plenty of
good fish and are supposed to be fed by subterraneous streams, I have
seen running from some of them as pretty rivulets of spring water as I
have ever seen in any other section of our Country—It is from that
circumstance generally believed they will not be likely to genrate those
fevers usually apprehended from stagnant waters. If people can
enjoy health here it is certainly the most delightful region I have ever
seen, but with all the advantages it offers you may expect to hear of
but few spots selling above the minimum price—The high waters I
presume have prevented many who might have been purchasers from
exploring the country and the few that will attend may all be satisfied
without competition—consequently I think it will not be adviseable

to urge the sale of any portion of the General's in less than a year

On the subject of my monthly Summary Statements I beg leave

Those now due will be made out & transmitted forthwith; but my
duties at the present moment & for some months to come must
necessarily cause delay in their rendition.—
I shall for the present make no contract for that part of the Road
between the St: John’s River & St: Augustine but defer it until I
have ascertained clearly how the funds appropriated are like to hold
out. In any event upon further reflection it seems hardly worth the

expense to build a Bridge over the St: Sebastian's where a ferry will
answer every useful purpose, to afford a “recreation” for the in-
habitants of St: Augustine, & which the corporation would hardly
ever be able to renew or even to keep in repair after it was built. I
shall do my utmost to complete the road for the amounts already
appropriated, but if I fail in doing so, I feel confident that no extrava-
gance in my expenditures will be imputed to me. The season has
been so very wet & unfavorable for work that it has caused delay &
much more expense than could have been reasonably anticipated.—
My arrangements will be fully made for the proper continuance of
my duties at Pensacola, the Barrancas, and on the Road, when I shall
make no unnecessary delay in repairing to Mobile Point for the duty
assigned me there; but it is indispensably necessary for myself & for
the public service that I should first inspect the troops at work on the
road as well as the Contractors. This however will cause no delay in
the investigation at the Point as I am not informed where Colonel
Russell * now is, of course do not know at what time he can meet me
there; besides Lieut. Alexander,” one of the material witnesses, must
be summoned from Tampa Bay. In the performance of this duty I
beg leave to assure you, General, that I shall do my utmost to give
satisfaction, & at the same time do strict justice to both parties, and
deep will be my mortification if I should fail to meet your expecta-
tions.—
The sum allowed for opening the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay
is very small, but the goodness of the Road must be graduated by it if
openened throughout the whole extent contemplated. Captain Clarke
has marked out the Road in the best possible direction from Tampa
Bay to its point of intersection with the Road from Pensacola to St:
Augustine, at the St. Fé natural Bridge; and it now only remains for
me to mark out the Road from Coleraine to a suitable point of inter-
section with the one he has marked out which will probably be a few
miles south of Wanton's, (or which is the same thing, a few miles
north of the Ouithlachuchy River.) The law I notice specifies
Wanton's particularly, but I have reason to believe that there is
better ground for the Road to pass over a few miles East of Wanton's.–
But I take it for granted that that Point was merely named in the
law as being a conspicuous one on the map.—I have hitherto referred
to it myself for that reason only.”—In marking this Road I want
neither party nor soldiers with me but shall employ one or two active
woodsmen living in & well acquainted with the localities of the Coun-
85 Gilbert C. Russell.

try, also a competent guide from among the Indians;—in this both
economy & expedition will be consulted. I am at a loss to determine
whether to mark out the Road immediately or postpone it until the
ensuing fall.” My present journey will take me as far as the Suwannee
River from whence it would not engage more than four weeks to make
the Survey & if it is not done at once the season will have advanced
too far to do it after I shall have been at Mobile Point. I am now
of opinion that I have sufficient time to mark out the Road & return
here in full time to meet Col. Russell & the witnesses at the Point.
However no avoidable delay will occur in marking out the Road &
completing it either by Contract or by the labor of the troops;—it is
probable however that it will not be commenced until october next.”—
The troops have openend near to the Appalachicola River & I
believe will have finished all that part of the Road not contracted for
West of the St: John's River by the first of June next. In that case
the troops will be at the disposal of the Department to work on the
Road from Colerain if no contract is made;—But in order to prevent
all difficulty & place me on a proper footing in regard to them, I
request you will be pleased to cause an order to be issued from the
Adjutant General's Office, directing the Com' officer to furnish men
on my Requisition to work on the Road from Colerain, similar to the
order issued in relation to furnishing the men to work on the Road to
St. Augustine. With the present Senior officers no difficulty of the
kind would occur, but changes might take place when an adherence
on the part of the Com" officer to a supposed point of Etiquette would
embarrass me greatly & retard all operations."

DEAR GENERAL On my arrival at this place I was pleased to find
that, the progress made by Cap" Burch in opening the Road from this
place to S' Augustine had greatly surpassed my most sanguine ex-
pectations. The Road is now nearly completed by the Troops as far
as the Appalachicola, and I am told by those who have travelled it
that the work is admirably executed. In the performance of this duty
he has encountered many embarrassments, but they have been always
overcome with the promptness and decision of a soldier. His skill
economy, and indefatigable exertions, in the discharge of every duty,
merits the highest approbation of the Department."
While at Washington you mentioned a proposition from Cap'
Burch to open a Road from S' Marks to Tallahassee. If you still
approve of the plan you would confer an obligation on that Section
of the country by giving the necessary orders for its accomplishment.
I can add nothing to what has been said by Cap" Burch relative to the
importance of this object and the ease with which it may be effected,
as he has examined both with great attention. Please present me

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
PENSACOLA, May 3" 1825.
GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose herewith an estimate for
funds for the 3" Quarter of 1825." At the end of the last month but a
small amount of funds remained on hand after crediting the amount
received from M* Chew, not quite sufficient to meet the demands on
the Q Mrs: dept. then due. I postponed drawing for the $10000,
until the last supposing it likely I should receive remittances.—
I have included in the estimate one half of the amount appropriated
for the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay under an impression that
Capt. Clark will require some part of it, and also that he will make
some requisitions on me which will require disbursements from that
appropriation specially. I do not expect to want any part of the
appropriation for the Road to St: Augustine before the close of the
year excepting the $5000 on my last estimate.
This is said to have been the most unfavorable season known in the
Country on account of the continued rains. I have however the satis-
faction to be able to state that the Bridges & Causeways on the military
Road stand uninjured by the heavy freshets excepting that much of
the sand is washed from off the latter and must be renewed by the
troops on their return march." The very unfavorable season added
to the disadvantage of having had so few men at work, the number
never having exceeded ninety including non-commissioned officers,
has caused an additional expense of $3000, in opening the Road.
Forage too has been scarce and dear. Corn is selling at 1.75 to $2, per
bushel in the Settlement where the troops now are. It is one dollar
per bushel here & the expenses attending its transportation would
more than balance the difference of price if purchased and sent from
here. There has been expended on the road $8000, which added to
* See post, p. 248.

## p. 245 (#259) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 245
the two Contracts (16,500$,) leaves a balance on the appropriations
of $3500.—This Balance will be expended in defraying outstanding
debts, extra pay due to the men, & in necessary expenses for the
troops returning to their post.—There will then remain Seventeen
miles of road between St: John's River & St: Augustine for which
there will be no funds."—To complete this will require an additional
sum of $5000, whether performed by the labor of the Troops or by
Contract.—The late extraordinary rise in the price of Cotton will
however divert the attention of the owners of negroes to its produc-
tion; and I have no idea that a contract could now be obtained either
for it or the Road from Colerain to Tampa Bay such as it would be
for the interest of the U. States to accept.—As there will be no funds
remaining from the appropriations I beg leave to ask your instructions
whether the Road shall be completed in the fall, so soon as the season
shall permit, without waiting for an appropriation, with the view
that if no appropriation is asked for or made, that that amount of
the expenses of the road shall be taken from the funds of the Q Mrs:
Dept.—In case it is decided to complete it I shall, unless a very
favorable contract for it offers, make my arrangements to do it with
the labor of the troops and by them at the least possible expense.—
After this Road is finished there will remain on hand property, which if
taken into the Q Mrs: Dept. or applied to the service of the Road
from Colerain to Tampa Bay, worth $3350:—If sold at auction it
would realize but little, & in any event I had determined to retain
& preserve all the property, excepting a part of the mules which I
should have sold on account of the expense of foraging them. They
will all however now be required for the service of the other road.—It
is to be observed too that while the troops have been on the Road
the expense of fuel has been saved to the Q Mrs: dept.; also the
forage of seven mules belonging to the dept: & employed in the
service of the Road, amounting in all to $1695.—I thought perhaps
these facts might operate in favor of charging some part of the expenses
of the Road upon the Q Mrs: funds, though I should much prefer to
see a special appropriation.

Congress by their act of the 3" March 1823. declared, “That all
waters on which Steam Boats regularly pass from port to port, shall
be considered & established as post roads, subject to the provisions
contained in the several acts regulating the P. O. establishment.” "
The 19th Sec: of the present P. O. law,” prohibits any Wessell which
regularly plies on a Water declared to be a post road, from convey-
ing any letters except such as relate to some part of the Cargo, under
the penalties therein provided. Steam Boats, of course, are not em-
braced in this prohibition. From the above provisions you will see,
that any Vessel, except a S Boat, which shall convey a letter (except
it relates to a part of the Cargo; unless by contract with this Dep',
on any water, on which a S Boat, performs regular trips, is liable to
a penalty of $50, with costs of suit. This law, if faithfully enforced,
will effectually prevent the abuse of which you complain. I take it
for granted, that S Boats do regularly ply in y Waters, & they must
be considered as post roads. The 19* Sec: of the law seems princi-
pally to refer to foreign Wessels or Wessels from foreign ports, but I
see no injustice in construeing the provisions of it, so as to embrace,
all coasting Wessels which ply on waters that are not post roads, &
the Commanders of which, have occasion to exhibit their papers to

the Officers of the Custom house. The Commanders of coasting
Wessels, which sail on waters not declared to be post roads, & who,
in the delivery of their Cargoes, have not occasion to apply to the
Officers of the Custom house, are under no compulsion to delivery
letters into the P. O. But it is hoped, that the Commanders of such
Vessels, will enter into Contracts for the faithful delivery of all let-
ters under their contract, into the P. O. on their being paid 3 cents,
for each letter. With Commanders of Such Wessels, I particularly
request, that you would make contracts. In a few days printed con-
tracts will be sent to you, & special instructions on the Subject."

Department of State, WASHINGTON, 24 May 1825.
WILLIAM SEBREE Esq." Marshal of the United States, for West Florida,
Pensacola.
SIR, Baron de Mareuil, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni-
potentiary from France, has lately addressed a complaint to this
Department," upon an ajudication by the Court of Monroe County,
in Florida, which assigned to the Officers and Men who rescued the
French Ship Calypso from the hands of pirates, in the last year, a
Rate of salvage which he considers extremely exorbitant and unjust,
being more than eighty per cent upon the value of the property saved.
In the absence of the Secretary, I take the liberty, therefore, of re-
questing your good offices, to procure from the Officer of that Court
a brief statement of its proceedings, in the case referred to, that we
may be enabled satisfactorily I hope, to give an answer to the French
Minister. I make this application to you, without knowing whether
Monroe County belongs to West Florida, or not, or whether the
lately appointed Attorney (to whom properly it should have been
addressed) for that portion of the territory, has yet repaired to his
post, or not; but I do so under the impression that your local knowl-
edge and experience will readily indicate to you the source whence
the desired statement may be obtained, and that your kindness will
induce a ready compliance with my request."

CANTON" NEAR BIG SWAMP 22” February 1825
SIR, I have the Honor to report, that the difficulty and delay,
occasioned by the want of a regular Communication with Some Post
route, are productive of great public, as well as private inconvenience.
It not unfrequently happens, that letters are three months in
reaching Tampa Bay, from Washington by the Pensacola route,
through which, they are now—Transported;—from the Bay, they
would not Come to this place, at all, unless purposely sent for, or
Some accidental Conveyance, Should present itself; much embarres-
ment and delay is thus occasioned; and in one or two instances, my
letters have been transmitted to the Gen' Post Office, as dead from
the Office at Pensacola; the director of which, has not thought proper
to send them to me.
I take the liberty to Suggest, that the establishing of a regular line
of expresses; between Tampa and S‘Augustine, by way of the Agency;
would entirely do away these evils, and afford great facility of Com-
munication for the War Department, with both the Indian Agency—
and the Military Post on Hillsborough.—Letters might with ease be
Conveyed Semi-monthly between Canton" Brooke and S*Augustine
and thus more than one half the time now taken in a Communication
between the Seat of Government, and that Post, would be Saved:-

the expense attending Such an establishment, must be trifling, Com-

The Indians, or some of their Negroes—might be induced, for a
moderate Sum, to Transport between St. Augustine and the Agency;
and from the latter place; letters could be taken to Canton" Brooke,
by a Military express:—Between the two last mentioned Points, the
distance is only about eighty Miles (three easy days ride) and from

from Fort St Marks, and to have the same turned over to the Civil

the public property had been previously removed, and that there
remained nothing but the Fort and public buildings, which I Ordered
Cap" Burch, the Ass" Quarter Master, to turn over to the Civil Gov-
ernment of Florida—It is in my Opinion, to be regretted, that the
Department of War, should have thought it advisable to Cause the
Fort and public buildings Connected with it, turned over to the Civil
Government of Florida, as they cannot be of the least advantage to
the Territory in a Civil, but if kept in a state of repair and garrisoned
with a few soldiers, would be of very Considerable advantage in a
military point of view—However as my views and Opinions were not
by the General Order, directed to be given on the subject, I will not
obtrude them on the General in Chief—I feel it due to Cap Crupper,
the Gentleman who had charge of the Fort and public buildings, to
say that he discharged the trust reposed in him, with great Care and

POST OFFICE DEP" 8 June 1825.
GEN' R. K. CALL of Florida (Tallahassee)
For the purpose of extending to the territory of Florida, the benefit
of mail communications, in a degree adjusted to its existing circum-
stances, on the 25" Ap'” last a letter of instruction was despatched
to the P. M at Tallahassee, empowering him to contract with some
suitable person, for the regular transmission of a mail every fortnight
between that place & Early C.h. G"; where it was intended to connect
it with the line, lately established between Hartford G* & Mont-
gomery A. The latter establishm’ got into operation it appears, on
the 19" of last month, under the superintendence of the P.M. at
Hartford, & in charge of M" M*loud" of the same place. Both these
persons by letters of the 16" & 23" ult" recommend that the contem-
plated connection between the mail from Hartford G* & Montgomery
A. & that from Tallahassee, should be formed at Pinderville in Dooly
C°, in preference to Early C.h., & assign some reasons for their advice.
By a reference to the Maps in the Dep" however, the distance which
this would require the Tallahassee mail to travel, is at least twice as

stance presents so strong an impression against the proposition, that
unless it should appear that the Maps cannot be relied on, I am dis-
posed to adhere to the first project. Counting upon y' accurate local
knowledge of that Country, I beg leave to invite y' attention to the
Subject, & y' opinion as to the comparative advantages & elegibility
of the two plans. The shortest & most direct route, would seem on
all accounts to be preferable."

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS"]
PENSACOLA, June 17th 1825.
GENERAL, I have the honor to report that on my arrival at the
Appalachicola River in May last I found that Mr Robinson had not
completed his contract nor was likely to do so in any reasonable
time;"—the continued high waters in the Winter & Spring he assigned
as the cause of the delay-a cause which I knew myself to have
existed. As the troops had arrived at the Appalachicola more than
a month earlier than I had calculated upon, I deemed it to be in-
dispensable to the convenience of the public that the road should
be opened forthwith through the Swamp of that River by them, to
enable travellers to use the road. In consequence of which I made
an agreement with M. Robinson by which he relinquished the Con-
tract into my hands, & I paid him for the work actually done—
having regard to the work remaining to do & the amount of the
Contract.—I paid him $.1000.—& he relinquishes the remaining
$.2000.——The troops then opened the Road through the Swamp
& ten miles East of it, to a point where it intersects a cart Road
leading from the Appalachicola River towards Tallahassee:—the
remainder of the Road specified in the Contract having been opened
by Robinson with the exception of not having the Bridged the creeks
on his part of the Route. The opening of this part of the Road by
the troops did not cause an additional expense of one hundred dollars
to the U. States, as they were upon the spot with their supplies.
The Bridges however on the part of the Road opened by Robinson
are only temporary such as will answer the purpose for the Summer;
But in the fall I expect to complete this part of the Road by erecting
new & permanent Bridges which will probably cause an expense of
$.1000. more.—From this statement you will perceive that by the
arrangement with Robinson, the road was not only opened for the
accommodation of travellers at once; but that near $.1000 will be
gained to the U. States on the Contract:—this saving however was
altogether accidental and arose solely from the circumstance of the
troops having been upon the ground with their supplies ready to
commence without loss of time or extra transportation. I consider
that Mr Robinson has lost in the payment made to him for the work
he had done, although he was allowed all that could have been equi-
tably given under his contract. He was unfortunate too in having
had a Bridge swept away at Little River by a heavy freshet, which

had been built by him on the Road, & which must have cost him
from four to five hundred dollars; but which was not taken into
into consideration, of course, in the Settlement made. I hope that
you will approve of the course I pursued in relation to him and his
contract, though I myself felt doubtful how far I had authority to
release him from the penalty contained in it. I am conscious that in
this affair I did only what common justice required towards him &
at the same time consulted the pecuniary interests of the U. States.—
I have deemed it adviseable not to continue the troops at work
on the Road during the heat of the Summer & they are now on their
return march to Pensacola. On their Return they are making some
improvements in their former work, & will be here in about ten days.—
If nothing should occur to prevent, I shall recommence the work by
the first of October next, & after completing the Bridges & causeways
on the route opened by M Robinson," march the detachment to the
St. John's River & open the Road from thence into the City of St.
Augustine." The whole of this will be accomplished by the first of
December if the Season is favorable, & the troops being in that part
of the Country will be commence without delay on the Road to
Tampa Bay. This arrangement will have economy of time & ex-
penditures in regard to both Roads for its primary object, & will
have that effect.—
The Contractor for that part of the Road from Ockolockony to
St: John's is progressing well with his work and calculates to be
ready to deliver it over to me by the first of December next. I have
made him a payment of near $.8000, on his contract. This Sum is
not in proportion to the work actually done, & for which I was held
bound to pay from time to time according to the terms of the ad-
vertisement, but I knew that in a short time he would have work
done equal to the sum paid him; and moreover I am myself individu-
ally, perfectly & fully secured against eventual loss from any dif-
ference that existed at the time between the work done and the
Sum paid.—
45 Burch informed the Quartermaster General on Nov. 7, 1825 (NA, WD,
QMG Consolidated Corr. File), that he had contracted for the completion of the
Robinson contract (ante, p. 129, n.). This contract, dated Oct. 8, 1825, was with
William Bailey for $1,000 and was to be completed by Dec. 15, 1825 (NA, WD,
QMG Reg. of Contracts, Bk. 1).
* Burch discovered that sufficient money would remain from the relinquished
Robinson contract to complete this section of the road. He informed the Quarter-
master General of this, Aug. 1, 1825 (NA, WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File), and
on Nov. 7, 1825 (loc. cit.), returned a contract for the work. This contract, dated
Sept. 28, 1825, was with John Bellamy for $2,500 with the work to be completed
by June 30, 1826 (NA, WD, QMG Reg. of Contracts, Bk. 1).

I beg leave respectfully to represent that in consequence of my not
having received the $.5000.—estimated for on the 8" February last, on
account of the Military Road, I find myself greatly embarrassed in my
money arrangements. Believing it would arrive so that I could meet
my private engagements, I have greatly exceeded the sum I had on
hand in my payments on account of the Military Road, as will appear
on my Monthly statement for June when it is forwarded. I have
therefore earnestly to solicit that if it is not already remitted, it may be
soon sent on; and also that the second appropriation of $.8000, may be
remitted to me immediately after. It forms no part of my character
or desire to have in hands large amounts of public money—hence this
request does not originate from any such source.—During the Summer
it is my wish to be able to make all the necessary arrangements in re-
gard to funds as well as other objects for the work of the fall & winter.
I shall leave here about the first of October for the interior of Florida
& cannot calculate upon returning to Pensacola before January fol-
lowing, & in the mean time all the disbursements on account of the
Road must be made, & that too in the interior of the Country where
I shall of necessity be, & where I ought to have the necessary funds
with me.—
My Estimate for the 3" Quarter of 1825, forwarded on the 3d Ulto:
contains an item of $.6000, for the Road from Colerain, which will be
sufficient to meet all the expenses on that account up to January next.
I have already procured, and furnished some articles to Capt. Clark
on account of it, & am about to get more. These accounts I shall keep
separate from my Quartermaster's accounts, in the manner prescribed
for Expenditures on account of the other Road.—
I enclose herewith a Monthly Summary Statement of the Expendi-
tures on account of the Military Road for May; and Reports of the
men on extra duty for April & May."—

letters of the 11th of April last,” and of the 9th "13" * 14th * & 20th *
Ulto:—
Receipts for the “Traveller's directory” are enclosed as directed.
A copy of the Book of Post Roads published by the Postmaster Gen-
eral is almost indispensably necessary for me to determine the dis-
tances on some routes, I should therefore be glad to be furnished with
one. The revised Regulations for the Army which I suppose has been
forwarded to me, as the Books have been received at the Post some
time back, must have miscarried, in consequence of which I request
that another copy may be forwarded to me.—
So soon as applied for, I shall turn over the Barracks &c. at the
Barrancas as ordered; but there is no public building in Pensacola
which I can turn over to the naval officers unless I rent others for the
Q Master's department:—The Storehouse which I have just been
repairing and one Blockhouse being all that I have at my disposal.
The two Blockhouses standing in the Street will be given up to the
City authorities in a few days, agreably to my former report & your
orders:—they are urgent to have them removed.”—I have made a
temporary exchange with Capt. Crupper, of the Corner storehouse
lately repaired, for two fireproof brick storehouses, both under the
same roof, affording four times the Storage, & free from danger by
fire;—the Storehouse belonging to the U. States was of wood. The
inducement on my part to change was because I obtained better &
more commodious Stores, equally well situated for public purposes;
and on his because he obtained by it a storehouse much more eligibly
situated for business and sufficiently large for his object in mercantile
business.—So large a quantity of provisions is now on hand here in
the Commissary's dep" but that for this exchange of Storehouses I
should have been under the necessity of renting."—

The Season had so far advanced that I deemed it advisable to post-
pone the survey of the Road from Colerain until the fall, when I can
have it done before the troops will be ready to commence working
upon it;"—in case they are not otherwise employed, but of which, how-
ever, I have not the most distant idea, knowing as well as I believe I
do, the present situation & Temper of the Creek Indians. If how-
ever there should be any operations against these Indians during the
Summer, I solicit the favor of you General to be allowed to leave my
Office in Pensacola for the time in charge of the clerk, which can be
done without detriment to the service during the absence of the
troops, & accompany the expedition as Quarter-master:—It would be a
deep source of mortification to me that a campaign had passed over
in the very district of Country where I am stationed & that I had
not participated in it.—
Conformably to instructions from Colonel Clinch I have turned
over Fort St. Marks to the civil Government of Florida. The Colo-
nel's order & the Governor's receipt are herein enclosed.—
I enclose herewith a monthly Summary Statement for May, and
Reports of Persons & articles hired,” and of Stores received for Trans-
portation & distribution. The new Regulations I perceive require
monthly estimates for funds; and I accordingly enclose one for July,
although I have already estimated for the same month in the 3"
Quarter of the current year.—At Stations like Pensacola remote from
Washington City and where so many unexpected causes for expendi-
ture arise, it is almost impossible to estimate for a less period than a
quarter; & then with but little of accuracy, excepting as to the regular
& uniform supplies. I hope however that the funds will continue to
be remitted quarterly. When absent so frequently & for such long
periods from Pensacola, my estimates cannot be furnished with that
regularity I could desire.—Believing that the General, knowing what
Troops will probably be employed, if any, against the Indians, will
remit me funds to meet the expenses occasioned by the movements
of the troops, I have omitted to estimate on that account.
By reference to the monthly Statement you will perceive that there
is a balance against the U. States. The Settlement of my accounts
in the Q Mrs: dept. for the quarter ending in the current month, will
augment this Balance considerably. I can however settle up the
Quarter's accounts without difficulty in anticipation of the receipt of
the funds should they not have arrived in time. I request that you
will be pleased to remit me the funds on account of the Quarter
master's department for the 3" Quarter, at an early date, in order that

St. Augustine TERRITORY OF FLORIDA 20" June 1825
SIR. As Mayor of the City of St. Augustine I have been directed
by the Corporation, to request from your Department some Specific
information respecting the disposition of certain portions of Public
property in this place, the use of which is respectively claimed by the
Civil and Military Authorities.
To the Cities Sir of every other Territory that has been added to
the Union, valuable donations of property have been made by Govern-
ment, but for some reason of which I am not aware, this customary
liberallity has been witheld for Pensacola & St. Augustine, though
this places stood particularly in need of assistance from the great
poverty, to which they have been reduced by the disturbances which
had occurred in the Province previous to the Cession.
The consequences of this course on the part of Government have
been peculiarly distressing to St. Augustine. We are at present with-
out the means of paying our City Officers, or even providing for the
ordinary expences of the Police, and besides hampered with debts.
We have understood that the Lot called the Hospital Lot together
with the Smithy which are now retained by the Military," though
not used by them, were at one time ordered to be delivered over
to the Corporation, but on some plea or other this has not been done—
The Collector of the Customs also retained possession of two of the
most valuable Houses in the Town with a large Lot annexed; and
though lately burnt out, still claims an authority over the property"—
Under this circumstances Sir we request that the Commanding
Officer here, and the Collector of the Customs may be directed to
deliver over to the Corporation, the Lots which have been specified,
and that we may be authorized to Dispose of the Stone upon the
Same, so as to be enabled to raise Some funds for the use of the City."

gether with a letter addressed to M. G. was found in their Camp,
after they had deserted it—A copy of this pass is enclosed: *) & did
not make it known to Major Wilson when he applied for his inter-
ference & protection—Again, -when the party were about entering
the Indian Camp, he prohibited the Interpreter from addressing them
as usual, (without Lt Canfields knowledge,) to explain the object of
the visit, which gave immediate alarm—and caused them to enquire
of him “why he did not talk,”—at this instant they observed the
Soldiers, and attempted to take their rifles & escape—which the
party present, endeavoured to prevent—in consequence of this I
presume, one of them naturally tried to arm himself with a pistol
from the belt of one of the Gentlemen, which produced the firing as
has been stated by Lt. Canfield.
As this affair produced some excitement & alarm here, I thought it
proper in obedience to your instructions to have an interview with
Genl. Hernandez of the Florida Malitia; in which we determined,
that the most adviseable method, was to send an express to the
Sub-Agent (the Agent being so far distant) stating fully the cir-
cumstances as far as they came to my knowledge; & assuring the
Indians that no hostility was intended, and if they would come in
they should receive the rifles we had, and have the broken one re-
placed, with provisions to carry them home—desireing him at the
same time to use his utmost endeavours to pacify them—as I con-
sidered they were only censureable so far as they had in a drunken
moment threatened M. Solano.
Since I commenced this I have been informed that a party of
Indians, (believed to be the same, with the addition of their families,)
were met near the S" Johns—they stated their Chief had his arm
broken, by M Solano, -that they were on their way home to make a
formal complaint, they appeared perfectly well disposed; & are said
to be some of John Hicks's men.
I expect the express will return to-morrow—if he does in time for
the mail, will communicate to you, such information as he may
bring me.”

Head Quarters Fort Marion S*AUGUSTINE 28th June—25
SIR, I have the satisfaction by this mail to enclose you a copy of a
communication, received by my express, from the Actg. Sub. Agent;”
from which I infer, we have no cause to apprehend future difficulty
from this party of Indians:—believing that it was due to the wounded
man, to afford him the benefit of Dr Weightmans” vauable assist-
ance,—and that it would have a salutary effect, in convincing the
Indians of our friendly disposition toward them (&as he could without
injury leave those of our men who were on the sick list,) I thought it
adviseable to direct him to proceed to the residence of the Sub Agent,
& give such assistance as was practicable—stating to that Gentleman,
that if the Doctor thought the man might be removed without injury
I would subsist, & have him attended to, by the Surgeon, until he
recovered—at the same time urging him if possible to induce the others
of the party, to come in and see me—receive their arms, & skins, if not
destroyed, and in that event I would give them the value—In doing
this Sir, I have adopted the course that in my judgment, was just, and
best qualified to promote harmony; although I almost fear there will
be a difficulty in having my accounts passed through the Q Masters
Dept.—to obviate this, if you approve of the course I have pursued I
beg leave to request, that you would make a statement on the subject
to that Depart" through the Secy of War.
One of the Seminole Indians was in Town, with whom (in the
presence, & at the request of Genl. Hernandez,) I had a talk, stating
the circumstance of the affair, & desiring him to explain it to his
brethern, on his return home, which he promised to do.—directing
them in the event of meeting any of the U. S. Troops, to quietly sub-
mit if required to do so, & suffer themselves to be brought in, assuring
them that no injury should result from it—and further, that you was
near, and if any difficulty should occur would punish them—though
you were anxious to treat them with kindness, if their Conduct would
permit you to do so.”

SIR, On the 6" of March 1824,” you presented to me as

“For services as District Attorney of the United States in

having then been but a few days charged with the Agency and being
unaware of the great care necessary to a safe discharge of its duties,
paid you three hundred and ninety $ as appears by Check surrendered
on settlement of my Bank account and by the charge against me on

of State and to the Officers of the Treasury, that I should close the

for disbursement during the present quarter on completion of the
Contracts of Mess" Stone,” Boyd, & White," which were delayed on
Account of sickness—I had a warm and fatigueing journey, making
my residence on the 19"—You were no doubt surprised, (on the re-
ceipt of the Account of Sales at Tallahassee) to find the lands selling
so low;"several circumstances (in my opinion) gave rise to it; amongst
the most prominent were—1" the order of the Treasury designating
what funds were receivable, and not sufficient time afforded to make
the Order generally known, in consequence of which a number of pur-
chasers came unprepared with the proper mony—2" the recent Treaty
by which the State of Georgia acquired a large tract of country from
the Creek Nation,” prevented very many people of that state from emi-
grating until after that land shall be disposed of by lottery, and their
land mony is held up with a view of speculating on those lands—3"
The generally entertained opinion, that the Tallahassee lands would
sell unreasonably high, deterred many of limited means from attend-
ing the Sale, and lastly may be assigned as prominent reasons the
scarcity of mony and limited time for the examination of the country
after the removal of the Indians, who manifested ill blood to the last
moment of their stay—
I found it necessary, from information received just before the
Sale to Suspend from Sale, the fractions on Lake Mickasuky in the
fourth Range, and have ordered a resurvey of them, by the Deputy
Surveyor who first ran them out—I have directed a Diagram of the
Surveys last made to be forwarded to me as soon as it can be completed,
and you shall be furnished with it as soon thereafter as practicable—
It will contain the largest proportion of good land not taken by private
claims, in the Territory, and is destined to sell well, particularly that
part of it termed the Chipola Country—The country west of Talla-
hassee will be thoroughly examined by persons wishing to purchase,

* An item in the Pensacola Gazette of June 4, 1825, stated that land sales started
on May 16, but that land was selling at a low rate owing to the absence of men of

would therefore suggest that the next sale embrace the country west
which has been sectioned as far as the Chocktawhatche—
The 7" Range West embraces the Appalachicola above the Parralel,

banks during the winter & spring—I shall have it completed early
this fall, together with an extention of the surveys to the true boundary
between Georgia and Florida. The 1* and 2" Townships of the

I propose for your consideration the Survey of six thousand miles
during the next season, which will comprise the finishing of some work
left from high waters and completion of contracts lying East & West
of Tallahassee and the Townshipping of West Florida and such sec-

JAMES GADSDEN TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., G 94:ALS]
S*AUGUSTINE July 7 1825
SIR. The citizens of the counties of S" Johns and Allachua have for
the last three weeks been agitated with apprehensions of Indian hos-
tilities, originating in report from the Agency and actively circu-
lated—My own Individual opinion has ever been, that the Florida
Indians feel too sensibly their weakness to deliberately hazard an open
rupture with the U States, yet the feelings which have been exhibited
of late by a few young warriors on a supposed injury received, and the
restless disposition existing from the unsettled state of most of the
savages, arrising from their very recent removal within limits to
which they have never been perfectly reconciled; may possibly lead
to secret individual outrages, and to depredations upon the stocks and
fields of the White neighbours in Allachua; irregularities which will
ultimately involve more extended hostilities—To guard against these
possible private aggressions; and their consequences: no policy would
be more effectual than the establishment of a temporary military Post
at or near the northern line of the Indian and in advance of the White
settlements *—The presence of a force in that quarter, if but con-
sisting of but a single company, would overawe the savages, restore
confidence to the present Inhabitants, weak in numbers, and encourage
into Allachua a further emigration of Enterprising citizens sufficiently
powerful to defend themselves, and willing to inflict exemplary punish-
ment upon those Savages who may be mad enough to invite hostili-
ties—A conviction of the beneficial results to be anticipated from the
establishment recommended, and a deep interest felt in the tran-
quility & security of the present settlements in Florida have alone
prompted me to volunteer the above suggestion to you with a hope
that it may meet with your approbation—The Citizens of Allachua
will sensibly acknowledge any relief which the condition of the Army
will enable you to extend, and the Territory generally will feel the
* This recommendation was repeated in another letter from Gadsden to the
Secretary of War, Aug. 15, 1825, in which he enclosed a letter of July 20 from Gad
Humphreys, stating that the Cabbage Swamp affair had been settled by arranging
to pay compensation to the Indians (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.).

NAVY DEP'MT. 14. July, 1825.
J. W. SIMONTON, Esq. Baltimore.
SIR, I received your letter of the 29th. June," and should have given
an earlier answer, if it had not been necessary to make some inquiries
upon the subject, which occasioned delay.
It is always desirable to avoid collision between the public force of
the country, and the private claims of citizens; and when injuries are
committed by the former, promptly to redress them.
The complaints heretofore made against Commodore Porter, and
now against Commodore Warrington, are difficult of examination,
from the absence of the necessary information. I have as yet been
able to investigate them only by the documents you have furnished,
and by an explanation from Commodore Porter. The result thus far,
is not precisely that which you seem to anticipate.
The title to Thompson's Island is considered as having passed to
the United States with the purchase of Florida. The title to, as well
as sovereignty over all the lands in that Territory, vested in the
United States, except in cases where individuals had acquired previous
to the purchase, a fair and legal title to particular portions of the soil;
and this title they were bound to shew against the prima faciae right
of the Government. To enable them to do this, Commissioners were
appointed to adjudicate their claim; and until they were decided
in their favor, the Government has felt at liberty to use the property,
according to its necessities.
When our officers were ordered to occupy Key West, they found
the title to it disputed.—With this controversy they had nothing to

do. It was their duty, under the orders of the government, to use
the Island, so far as it should be necessary for their accommodation.
It is possible, that in doing this, they may sometimes have pressed
on the convenience and interests of individuals; but it is to be hoped
not intentionally, nor unnecessarily.
Your wish however upon the subject, shall for the present be
gratified. Com. Warrington has been ordered to make a temporary,
if not permanent removal of the forces from that Island, and to
place whatever property shall be left there, in a state of safety.'
He will doubtless be able to do this, without further inconvenience

NEAR NASHVILLE [Tennessee] July 24* 1825.
Dr SIR, I have the honer to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
under date 23" ult” ” in answer to mine of the 4” same month.”
My wishes have been met by the receipt of the Treasures draft on
New York, for which I thank you—
Permit me to request that I may be furnished with the precise
amount to be included in the Salary accounts for my clerks, in the
two succeeding quarters, to embrace the appropriation of the last
session—The amount remaining to be drawn, will be found after
deducting the sums paid in the year 1824 and the two preceeding
quarters; the former of which I have no recollection of and the dupli-
cates of the Accounts are in florida—
Your wishes shall be promptly met with regard to the boundary
lines of Townships with a view to the connection of the public surveys;
& whilst on this subject I deem it proper to inform you that in giving
my instructions to the Deputy Surveyors, with respect to the running
of Township lines only where the land is poor and unsaleable, I have
uniformly given the words of the law on that subject for their govern-
ment—I have been often called on for my opinion of what properly
constitutes “a body of poor, unsaleable land”, which, under the act
of Congress is only to be township"—I have uniformly answered that
I did not feel myself authorized to give construction to the law, but
at the same time, If I were authorized, I should think its provision
fulfilled, when there should be found a sufficient quantity of land
within a township, that would sell, or be entered: to pay the surveying
of said Township, believing it to be the wish, and policy of the General
Government to give as dense a population to Florida as possible,
and I am constrained to believe from actual demonstration that a
large proportion of the pine lands in Florida are destined to yield
independance to the industrious Husbandman.
The opinions of my Surveyors (I believe generally) founded on their
own observations, induces the belief that there is not a Township in
Florida that will not pay for its surveying—I shall be happy to receive,
what your experience and better judgment may suggest on the fore-
going subject—The estimate made in my last if desirable, can be
extended by surveying East of the Suwannee without interfering
with private claims (as I believe) until we near the Alachua Settle-
ment—The limits suggested for a land sale in my last, without the
necessary reflection as to quantity; will embrace as much land as

by law—
My family being numerous and the larger portion of them helpless,
I would much prefer moving by water and therefore deem it necessary
to inform you that there is some uncertainty as to the period when
the waters afford steam boat navigation and that I might possibly
be delayed until the 1" of December in this country—If this arrange-
ment is incompatible with the public interest, you have only to inti-
mate it, as I have ever made it a sacrd duty to sacrifice private wishes
to public good—

place as we have now a mail, in the mean time I have deposited the
bond with the Receiver. this seems to be all that could have been done
u(nder] the circumstances and I hope for the time being will be deemed
satisfactory *
There is much solicitude expressed in the ol{d] Settlements in this
district in regard to the time when the lands in their quarter will be
brought into market and it is a matter which interests them on the
score of getting their funds ready of a proper Kind which is very
difficult here. It is with diffidence that I venture to suggest anything
to you in regard to the sale of these lands, but as I can See no evil that
can possibly result and possibly some benefit may result, both to the
government and the settlers in this country I hope it will not be
deemed amiss and you can take it for what it is worth. From my
observation made in a residence of nine months and the experiment
made in the late Sales I am convinced that it is not the best policy to
bring the unsettled parts of the district into market first for it has the
effect to throw a large proportion into the hands of men who purchase
to sell again at a higher price to emigrants and both the treasury and
the emigrants loose by it. it is true there was a necessity for selling
the unsettled lands around the Seat of government, else the Chipola
tract of Country would have presented itself first for disposal
Were I permitted to suggest a plan for bringing in the remaining
lands of this district which I thought best calculated to benefit the
treasury and accomodate the Settlers efinit. it would be to bring into
market twice or three times a year a reasonable portion of the best
lands, beginning with those best settled. in this way three or four
Sales would dispose of all the remaining good lands in this district,
after which one more sale of the whole remainder might conclude the
business. according to this plan the Chipola lands would first present
themselves.” this settlement is three or four years old and is getting
into comparatively easy circumstances] but dare not make the neces-
sary improvements until [they] own the land, next to that the younger
Settlements lying between the Apalachicola and the Ranges lately
sold then Holmes" valley and the ajacint tract of country. after which
the remainder would comprehend very little good land

There is another circumstance connected with this Subject that I
have been very much [im]portuned to name to you which certainly
had a very embarassing effect at the late Sales. the only currency
u[sed] to any extent in this whole country is the Georgia and Carolina
bank notes and these are not made receiv[able] in the land office. if
there is no solid objection to th[ose] banks the receiving of that money
would enable ma[ny] persons to bid, and to enter lands that otherwise

[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
PENSACOLA, August 1* 1825.
GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose herewith my accounts and
vouchers for the last quarter contained in three bundles numbered.”—
The Regulations do not provide any allowance for wastages, but
believing that a reasonable per centage would be allowed, I have in
these accounts charged it, according to the actual deficiency. I
have neither charged or noticed the loss heretofore in any of my
accounts, although I knew the constant loss was swelling the deficiency
& causing the accounts to shew more on hand, of fuel, hay, & corn
than was really the case.—
I have also in these accounts paid the Carpenters' Bill for work
done on the public lot & buildings in Pensacola. About the time I
commenced this work the troops were ordered on the Military Road,
consequently there were no Soldiers to employ as mechanics. But
as I was authorised to hire citizens to build Bridges on the Military
Road, it did not make any difference as to expense whether I employed
them on the Buildings or on the road. I therefore trust that my
having employed them as I did will not meet with your dissapproba-
tion. The buildings are now in a situation to be useful for a long
period with little or no expense; and the rent saved by having them
put into condition to be occupied, will, in two years commencing from
the 1* of January last, more than repay the expense caused to the
Quarter Mrs’: department. Two of the blockhouses have been
taken down & removed by the City authorities; and I understand it
to be their intention to cause the removal of the remaining two, one
of which is occupied as the Custom house. They were all standing
in the Streets of the City.—

The charge in my accounts for property received from the Road
was necessary to the public service, being required for the Service of
the troops on their march to Fort Mitchell, & more particularly while
stationed there. I therefore thought it better to take teams from
the service of the Road where they were not required during the
Summer months, than to purchase others; besides it would not have
been practicable to make the purchase at the time without causing
too great delay.

SIR. The enclosed documents will sufficiently explain the circum-
stances to which they relate. It will be seen that the deposition of
Mr Solano" which led to the military measures adopted was fully
corroborated by the return of the three Indians whose disappearance
& long absence had occasioned their threats.—M” Solano is a respect-
able planter of this territory who has for at least thirty years had
intercourse with the Indians, & I have reason to believe, has always
been esteemed & respected by them; both from the justice & propriety
of his conduct towards them, & the Kindness & protection which
they frequently rec" from his Father, whose house, under the former
Government, was their constant resort & home on their visits to
this City.—M* Solano also perfectly understands the Indian language
& was therefore well able to judge from their conduct & threats,
during their hostile visit to his house, that they meditated mischief
towards the whites in the event of their not finding their missing
companions. His deposition & subsequent removal of his family
into town renderd therefore the military precautions unavoidably
necessary.—

Mil. Bk. 12).
* Hernandez enclosed copies of twenty six documents that he had initiated
as a result of this Indian scare. The letters are numbered in accordance with
the parenthetical numbers as follows.
He notified Maj. William Wilson, commander of the U.S. troops at St. Augus-
tine, on June 21, 1825 (1), that he would furnish guides for the movement to
protect the inhabitants and in another letter of the same date (2) he furnished
a copy of Solana's deposition. On June 24, 1825 (3), he notified Lt. Edwin R.
Alberti (Alberty) of the pay due to the guides furnished Wilson's command and
on the next day (4) asked the lieutenant if the expedition had discovered any
signs of Indian hostility. In another letter to Alberti of June 25, 1825 (5), he
made an appointment for a personal consultation and at the same time (6) re-
quested of Col. George Murray, commander of the second regiment of Fla.
militia, how many men he would have for service. On June 30, 1825 (9), Hernan-
dez ordered Murray to organize one hundred men and assume their command
but he did not overlook peaceful measures. On the same day (10) he sent
Horatio S. Dexter to determine the attitude of the Indians and wrote two letters
to Indian agent Gad Humphreys, July 5, 1825. One (11) introduced Dexter;
the other (18) gave the background of the Indian scare. At the same time (12)
he instructed Murray to detail thirty men and an officer for service with the
U. S. troops. The next day (13) he called the staff meeting (post, p. 294). The
staff met again on July 7, 1825 (15), to consider a report from Humphreys of
Indian activity but decided to delay sending out the detachment until they
heard further. Hernandez requested from Marshal Waters Smith on July 7,
1825 (16), the use of rooms in the Government House for the equipment of
the thirty man detail, and from Lt. Alberti, transportation and supplies (17).
Through his Aid de Camp, William Travers, on the same day (19), he ordered
Brevard to proceed to organize the fourth regiment of Fla. militia. Hernandez
wrote again to Alberti, July 8, 1825 (20), acknowledging that he realized supplies
could not come from the Federal government unless the militia had been mustered
into that service. A requisition was sent immediately to Quartermaster William
H. Simmons (21) and intelligence concerning it supplied to Murray (22). By
July 10, 1825, Humphreys sent the information that the Indians were peaceful

SIR On the night of the 20" Ins" M Philip Solana, a planter
residing about twenty five miles north of this City (Diego Plains)
called to inform me that Six Indians with their Rifles had been at
his house to demand of him three Rifles which they Stated he, Solana,
had in his possession belonging to three Indians who were missing,
and whose families, they Said, were then crying for their loss, that
the Indians entered his house in a threatning attitude, and Said, at
the time they parted from him, that they would revenge themselves,
if they did not find the Indians, they were in quest of.
I instantly went with Solana to the Judge of the Superior Court
of this District and requested him to make affidavit of the facts
before the Judge, which he did, at about 10 oclock that night—I
then took the affidavit, and in company with the Judge presented
it to Major W" Wilson, who, very readily, offered a Detachment of
his Troops (declineing any other aid from me than the necessary
Guides and Interpreters) to endeavour to overtake those Indians
previous to their putting any of their threats into execution.
The expedition left this, with the expressed intention however, to
prevent mischief by the mildest means Suited to the object, and having
Soon overtaken the Indians, the following morning, an advance
guard got up with them, which, it is Said was received by the Indians
as friends, but at the Interpreter, a negro well known to them, who
was with this advance, having been ordered not to speak, the Indians
and Hernandez notified Murray (24) that the militia would be discharged. The
next day he issued a general order (25) praising the actions of the men and on
July 12 (26), he enclosed all of the documents to Maj. Gen. Edmund P. Gaines

were alarmed by his Silence, and Seeing the main body of the Troops
approaching, at once, Suspected the intention of the expedition and
Suddenly attempted to Seize their arms; in this, they were prevented,
with the exception of two of them. At this time a Pistol was fired,
when the Indians fled precipitately: this, together with the report
of the Pistol, caused the body of the Detachment to open the fire
upon them, with, what effects, I cannot Say at this moment—
I have understood that a party of Indians were Seen crossing the
river S. Johns, and that one of them had his arm broken and that he
Said it had been broken by a Shot fired by one of the expedition,
had any lives been lost I Suppose they would have mentioned that
also.-
Lieu" Alberty, the present commanding officer of this Garrison,
has Sent out an express to the Indian Sub-Agent M. Gary, explaining
the cause of the expedition, and desireing him to State to the Indians
that the four Rifles which were taken from them, would be returned,
and for the injury they had Sustained, if it has not been produced
by their own misconduct, every proper Satisfaction Should be made.
I have ordered the Commanding officers of the 2" and 4", Regi-

furnish from their Regiments, in the event that this unpleasant affair
Should make it necessary to bring any part of the militia under my

SIR. The Indian hostilities with which we were lately threatened
the rumour of which has doubtless reached you, and the Serious aspect
which the danger assumed from the Agent's Sending to demand Mili-
tary aid from the comm of the U States Troops at this Post rendered
it necessary to me to organize a portion of the militia of my Brigade
to be held in readiness to Succour if required the Regulars who were
Sent out or to meet any further emergency that might arrise.—I
accordingly issued orders to Col: Murray to make a draft of one
hundred men from his Regiment and to detach thirty of those for im-
mediate Service—As the draft fell chiefly upon the old or Spanish and
Menorchan Inhabitants of the place, who were dependent upon their
daily exertions for Subsistence and whom I deemed it a point of policy
to inspire with alacrity in the performance of their duties and to
familiarize them with the provident details of the militia System by
Shewing them that they would be provisioned and taken care of when
called into the Service of the United States—I have ordered rations to
be issued to them from the time of their receiving arms which was on
the 8* Ins" expecting to receive Satisfactory intelligence from the
Agency on this night or tomorrow, the expence incured will be but
trifling, while the advantage of giving this portion of the militia who
were Strangers to the nature of our Service, such an insight into its
arrangements as may inspire them with confidence and promptitude

on future occasions, are I hope considerations Sufficient to justify the
measures I have taken and that this course will meet with the appro-
bation of your Excellency—On the first intelligence of the apprehended
hostilities I Sent M Dexter who is acquainted with and has the Con-
fidence of the Indians to assertain their dispositions, and real inten-
tions; and from the report he made on his return was induced to believe
that nothing of a Serious nature was to be anticipated—It was Sub-
siquent however to this that Col: Humprys made a demand upon the
commander of this Post for assistance, upon which, I again Sent
M Dexter as an express to the Agency and expect this night to receive
his report, and doubt not that it will prove Satisfactory and evince
that no danger is to be apprehended from our borderers, and whose
weekness and dependent Situation preclude the possibility of their
Seriously, attempting hostilities.—I should State to you that a volun-
teer Company of 38 men officered by an election among themselves
tendered Col: Murray their Services on the occasion but their being

with the advice of a Council of my Officers declined receiving them
under my command.—I found also that many of them with were per-
sons on whom the Militia Drafts in any further emergency Would fall,
and understood that many of them had expressed a want of Confidence
in the Officers regularly appointed, and had given this as a reason for,
prefering the volunteer Service, a proceeding which plainly tended to
insubordination, and was calculated to bring the existing Militia estab-

Authority to receive the Services of Volunteers Officered by them-

In May last a letter which had been addressed to the Sec of War,
by an Officer of the U. S. Army stationed in the vicinity of Tampa
Bay," was ref" to this Dep" the object of which was to procure an
alteration in the direction of the correspondence maintained by &
with the Military detachments on the Western Coast of E Florida.
The writer of that letter complained, that letters destined for that
quarter were sent from Washington to Pensacola where they some-
times lay 3 months for want of a Conveyence to Tampa Bay—which
when, it chanced to be afforded, was sure to be tedious & unsafe. He
suggested that all this correspondence should be forwd" in the first
instance to S* Augustine, & thence despatched by expresses under
the direction of the War Dep" to Tampa Bay. This course appeared
to direct, plain, & judicious, & its adoption was recom" by this Dep"
in a letter to the Sec of War." It is probable from y' letter that it
has been determined on & therefore it is proper that in future you
discontinue returning packets directed to Tampa Bay, by way of
Savannah to Pensacola. You will report, upon receiving this letter,
whether a line of expresses to pass once a fortnight, has not been
established by the military Officers—& if not, whether such an
arrangem" might not be easily effected by y'self. The Cont” is in no
case to leave any part of the mail. If its increase of bulk require the

ROBERT BUTLER Esq Surveyor General near Nashville, Tennessee.
SIR, Your letter of the 24" of July,” has been received & has been
referred to the 1* Auditor with a request, that he will furnish you with
the information required in relation to the Salary for Clerk Hire.
By surveying & sectioning large quantities of Land in Louisiana &
Mississippi, before the private claims were finally acted upon, & in-
cluding much barren piny land, the Government & individuals have
been put to great inconvenience & much money has been unneces-
sarily expended. Your instructions were given with a view to prevent
the recurrence of the same errors—The object of the Government, is
for the present to bring into market, the lands in Florida, which are
entirely exempt from private claims, & which may be most in demand
for the accommodation of actual settlers—You will, therefore, take
care to have no township sectioned, in which there are private claims—
with respect to poor & unsaleable lands, it is difficult for me with the
limited knowledge I possess of the topography of the country, to give
precise instructions—The ground assumed by you, that, if there is as
much land in a township, as will sell for the expenses of surveying, it
ought to be sectioned, is too broad—The object of the Government is
to Section no township, or part of a township, for the present, except
such as contain a considerable portion of such lands, as will probably
sell for the minimum price, & which will be required for settlement, in
a reasonable time, with these views the question must be left for you
to give such instructions to the Surveyors, as your better information,
in relation to the various descriptions of soil, their products & the
demand for each description, may enable you to do—After all much
must depend upon the judgment, discretion & integrity of your
Deputies"—
With great respect, yr. obt. Ser”

RICHARD K. CALL TO GEORGE GRAHAM
[NA: GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee: ALS]
TALLAHASSEE 20"Augs" 1825
SIR I have the honour herewith to enclose, transcripts from the
accounts in the books of my Office embrasing all the transactions of
the quarter ending the 30" June 1825.” I regret that the want of a
safe conveyance has prevented me from forwarding these accounts at
an earlyer period. The injudicious arrangements, and the ultimate
failure of the contractor for the transportation of the mail, has ren-
dered this mode of conveyance too uncertain to be relied on, and I
much fear that may of the communications which I have made to
your Department have not been received.
I have been some what at a loss to determine what is required of
me under the following article of my instructions, under date of the
28" of Feb 1825.” “On the last days of March, June, September,
and December the accounts in your Ledger must be closed agreeably
to the [MS. torn] prescribed by the last five entries in the Journal
and transcripts from these accounts in your Book must be sent to
this Office quarterly for examination.
My Books have been elesed brought up agreeably to the foregoing
instructions, but I have had some doubts with regard to the propriety
of the form in which the “transcripts” from the accounts is made,
though I have been unable to adopt a better one. The reason why
I have entertained doubts on the subject is that most of the informa-
tion contained in the “transcripts” of accounts for the quarter, has
already been given in the several monthly returns embraced within
that quarter, and therefore appears to be unnecessary. I however for-
warded them for your information, and shall be happy to learn as
early as possible your approval or disapproval of them.
The Salary account of M" Overton for his services as Register has
been corrected, and he has been allowed his Salary from the period of
his having qualified in Office. His bond having been forwarded to
your Department we have [MS. torn] the pre [MS. torn] day, but I
believe it was [MS. torn] what earlyer than the time for which Salary
is charged. -
Owing to a mistake the receipts of M* Overton for his Salary were
taken from the 1* of June until the 23" of July, the time when he
was relieved in Office by his successor Mr Ward,” instead of their
being two receipts one ending on the 30" of June and the other on

JAMES GADSDEN TO THEYQUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS*]
CHARLESTON S" C 20" August 1825
SIR In my previous communications to you " I have reported
the obstacles encountered, the sickness and death which afflicted my
party, and the disasters generally which attended my first operations,
in surveying the route of a road from St Augustine to Cape Florida–
After having, under complicated embarrassments, penetrated to the
S" Lucie river, two thirds of the distance contemplated, disease in my
camp rendered my party unfit for active service and compelled me
to retrograde to the settlements on the Tomoka–Having reorganised
my Corps my second efforts were attended with more success, and I
now report to you in detail the result of my labors and observations
in the performance of the duties of the commission received from the
Department over which you preside—
The country south of S” Augustine to the very extremity of the
promontory of Florida is alluvial and has been formed by successive
encroachments on the Atlantic—A chain of inlets or sounds and fresh
water lakes extend north & south for the greater part of the distance,
seperated from the ocean by a narrow barrier of sea beach and sand
hills, and communicating with it at intervals by contracted & shallow
entrances—On the west of these inlets and lakes is a parallel chain
of sand hills from 3% to 3% of a mile wide intersected by inconsiderable
pine flats and oak hammocks; the western base of which is washed
by another succession of smaller lakes or saw grass ponds and swamps
occasionally connected with each other by natural canals–To the
*NA (GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 16), to the effect that transcripts from his
ledger were required for the settlement of accounts. The same letter acknowl-
edged the receipt of routine returns by Call, dated Aug. 15 and Sept. 2, 1825
(NA, GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee).

west of these ponds commence the pine planes and saw palmetto
flats common to low latitudes, varying in the character of their
surface and elevation, and more intersected by grassy and cypress
ponds as you descend south, untill they are lost in communication
with the Ever glades, or submerged flats of the Cape spotted with
small islands of pine, palmetto &c—Immediately west of these pine
planes is an immence grassy savannah innundated the greater part
of the year, and forming the sourse of the river St Johns—This great
basin receiving the overflowings of all the interior swamps and ponds,
branches to the East and West, and discharges its accumulated
waters by many minor streams which disembogue into the Atlantic
ocean & Gulf of Mexico—It is an inexhaustible Reservoir, tributary
to almost all the rivers which intersect & flow through the promontory
of Florida—Those on the eastern coast and which are among the
principal obstructions to the opening of a road to Cape Florida, are
the Tomoka, Spruce, Elbow, Crane, Turkey, S. Sebastians, S' Lucie,
Jupiter, Rio Seco, Middle, New, Ratones and Miami Rivers—The
route of the road surveyed is on the pine lands described as laying
between the sand hills & second chain ehain of minor lakes or ponds
on the east, and the great basin of the S" Johns west, untill opposed
at Jupiter inlet by the ever glades, and from thence on the sand
beach of the ocean as the only practicable land communication with
the Cape—The beach at low tide is spacious and firm, and the lakes,
sometimes approaching within 60 and never receeding more than
230 yards from the ocean, furnish an abundant supply of fresh water—
An attempt to penetrate by the ever glades proved unsuccessful; the
whole surface of the earth was covered with water from 4 & 5 inches
to 2 and 3 feet in some places—For two days my party waded thro
these submerged flats and with the greatest difficulty could a spot be
found sufficiently extensive and free from water, for dry it was not,
on which to pitch our tents—On the last night we had to elevate our
blankets from the water which flowed beneath our bodies, with sticks
palmetto leaves &c—The route blased crosses the streams, which
have been enumerated, at points where they are fordable or where
they present facilities for ferries or bridges—and ferries will be only
necessary on the Tomoka, St Sebastiens, S* Lucie, Middle & New
Rivers—A more eastern route so as to edge the western base of the
second chain of sand hills, which have been noticed, would present
the best ground for a road, and many of the difficulties on the route
marked, from ponds flats &crequiring causewaying, might be avoided-
But in this case greater labor would have to be encountered in
removing an impenetrable growth of scrubs palmetto &c and more
ferries become necessary over rivers of no inconsiderable magnitude—
Thus Elbow, Crane and Turkey Creeks which are but minor streams

and fordable were crossed by the road are in less than one mile to
the east swollen into rivers of 80 and 100 yards wide with deep and
precipitous banks, while the S* Sebastians and S" Lucie the one
about 25 and the other 80 y” wide at the points designated for
ferries, nearer their mouths widen into rivers of a half and of a mile
in extent—These difficulties however would not weigh in considera-
tion with the superior character of the ground otherwise obtained,
if the country was such as to encourage a hope of the frequency of
travelling or the density of population ever presenting sufficient
inducements to Individuals to keep up ferries at the points desig-
nated—the whole country south of the Moschetto offers but feeble
allurements to an agricultural population, and this opinion is some-
what strengthened by the fact of their being no evidences within
that distance of old Indian settlements,—Scattering hunting camps
alone indicate the purposes to which that district had been hitherto
appropriated—The only land fit for cultivation is on the immediate
margins of the rivers or inlets, inconsiderable as to extent, and of a
light sandy soil, bearly sufficient to raise the ordinary subsistence in
grain for small families whose energies may be directed to other than
Agricultural objects—The resources of this Southern district of
Florida are limited to ranges for Stock of Cattle, to wrecking and the
fisheries, objects in themselves opposed to a dense population, and
only inviting to that class of adventurous emigrants who attach
little value to roads, and would prefer in their neighbourhood com-
munications making use of those water channels and—lakes provided
by nature—These channels are in the chain of inlets and lakes which
have been noticed as extending with but partial interruptions the
whole length of the coast from S' Augustine to Cape Florida—Thus
the waters of the Mesehette-e: alifax-abbreaeh-within-8-miles—e
Metanzas flowing into S' Augustine Harbor and those of the Mos-
chetto or Halifax approach with 8 miles of each other, while the
southern extremity of the Latter are seperated from those of Indian
river by a narrow isthmus of less than one mile in width—Indian
river in the high waters is connected by a natural canal with a large
lake south, which with very inconsiderable labor may be made to
communicate through the Rio Seco and Middle, with New River
discharging into the Atlantic only 20 miles north of Cape Florida—
But by only opening the communication, by a canal through a low
level surface requiring no locks, between the Matanzas & Moschetto
or Halifax and the latter inlet and Indian river, a distance of but 9
miles, a safe inland communication along the eastern coast of Florida
from S' Augustine south for upwards of 200 miles may be secured
to the country;—the benefit of which may be extended north as far
as Charleston S" C by another canal of about 10 miles in extent,

uniting the waters of the North River with those of the S" Johns—
Connected with this imperfect general sketch of that portion of the
eastern section of Florida which has come under my observation in
the survey of the road assigned me, I subjoin a more minute descrip-
tion in divisions of the whole distance according to the variety of
character in the country, with a geographical sketch estimate of
probable costs of construction of roads &c."—
—Description—
From Solanos Ferry west of St Augustine by the route of the old
Kings road to Tomoka 44% miles—For the first 25 miles generally
flat pine lands untersected by three creeks, Moultrie, Three Runs,
and Mill, the first about 15 feet wide and easily bridged; the second
from swamps on both sides intersected by small branches about 200
and the third about 70 yards wide—Within the same distance 5 old
causeways, the whole not exceeding 250 yards in extent will require
repairing—The last 9% miles to Tomoka sandy black jack, scrub &
spruce pine ridge, occasionally diversified with pine flats and spotted
with small ponds, and intersected by nine smallcreeks running to the east
and from 15 to 25 feet wide, all easily bridged—Tomoka river about
45 yards wide and favourable for a ferry, high bluffs on the south and
marsh on the north bank with an old causeway about 200 yards wide
and easily repaired—The situation owned by M Andeson who resides
on the spot and willing to establish a flat for the accommodation of
Travellers so soon as the road can be opened—From Tomoka to Spruce
Creek 15 m 32 c—crossing near the Tomoka a small branch tributary
to the same—Level pine lands interspersed with saw palmetto flats,
and low wet grassy planes with scattering growth of dwarf pine Trees,
occasionally spotted with Cypress ponds and swamps—The greater
part of this distance will require causewaying—
From Spruce Creek to Indian River 33 m 76 c–Spruce creek, in-
cluding the Cabbage tree and hammock margins which are subject to
overflow and will require causewaying, is about 200 yards wide—The
first 10 miles low wet pine saw palmetto flats interspersed with Cypress
ponds and grassy planes, converted from their lowness after heavy
rains into ponds—For the next 6 miles cypress swamps and saw grass
ponds diversified occasionally with saw palmetto & baybush flats—
These are the sources of Indian river and unavoidable as extending
west and communicating with the Savannahs & tributaries of the
S" Johns river—The last 7 miles pine and saw palmetto planes singu-
larly spotted with saw and flag grass ponds and occasionally diversified

with Sea Sand hills, and pine land swells, with an undergrowth of
broom grass; their superior elevation only detected by their com-
parative dryness—The greater part of this distance will require cause-
waying, and the labor in rendering practicable for wheel carriages a
road through the cypress swamps, heads of Indian river, will be con-
siderable.—
Ridge of Indian river 23 m 40 c—For one half of this distance high
ridged diversified with sea sand undulations & occasionally indented
with ponds—The last half, level pine lands comparatively dry, spotted
as usual with ponds—To Elbow Creek 15 m 40 c-to Crane Creek
9 m 40. To Turkey Cr—11 m 10 c to St Sebastians 5 m 20 c To St
Lucie 34 m 55 c the whole distance 76 m 5 c-generally pine planes
diversified with occasional swells of saw palmetto lands and inter-
spersed with grassy flats spotted with Cypress and bay ponds—A
large portion of this distance will require causewaying, the base how-
ever being sand a solid foundation for a road may be obtained—
Elbow Crane & Turkey creeks are narrow from 15 to 20 feet wide
where crossed and seldom otherwise than favourable, they may with
great facility be bridged—The S" Sebastians, & S" Lucie are deep with
perpendicular banks—the sites however are favourable for ferries, the
former about 25 & the latter 80 yards wide—From S. Lucie to Jupi-
ter River 30. m 50 c The country similar in general character to
that just described, the ponds however increasing in number and mag-
nitude, and the dry land scarcer as you descend south—crossing in
the distance 4 small streams easily bridged, tributaries to a southern
branch of the S" Lucie—Jupiter river about 35 yards wide subject
appearantly to great freshes but may be bridged—
From Jupiter River to Sea Beach 8 m 20 c crossing the canal or
communication between the Lakes south and Jupiter inlet north—
A grassy channel about 70 yards wide with a rapid current from the
lake, subject to overflowings when the lake is full, though generally
fordable with firm sandy bottom—The first 4 miles flat pine lands
comparatively dry, the last sea sand undulations—
On Beach—to Rio Seco 35m 15 c—Middle River 5 m 30 c Mouth
of New River 13 m 43 c West point of Bear Cut opposite Cape
Florida (bay about 3 miles wide) 20 m 45 c–The whole distance 74 m
48c—The beach at low tide is spacious and firm with the ocean on
the east and sand hills and chain of fresh water ponds or lakes on the
west sufficiently convenient to furnish to the traveller an abundant
supply of water—The sand hills do not present the naked appearance
of more northern latitudes, but are generally covered with grass and
occasionally crowned with a thick overshadowing growth of the Sea
or Mangrove grape—From being exposed generally to a wind blowing
uniformly from the same quarter, regularity has been given to their

figure, and instead of the sea sand undulations common to the North,
and the dazling reflection of light from the convex and concave in-
equalities of their surface, these ridges present the appearance of
artificial parapets with their regular scarpes & berms all seemingly
sodded with the skill of an Engineer—The Rio Seco has been
closed by a sand bar which has formed across its mouth, and similar
sandy seals have been placed very recently upon Jupiter & little
Matanzas inlets—The whole Atlantic coast of Florida presents evi-
dences of these struggles between the sands set in operation by the
agitations of the ocean, and the currents of the rivers, the one striv-
ing to close and the other to maintain an outlet for their waters—
Middle river is now fordable at its mouth, and a sand bar, forming
across the New River, has already diminished the depth of water at
its entrance to less than 4 feet—Middle river will more than probable
suffer the fate of the Rio Seco, Jupiter &c, and this decrease in the
number of the outlets to the lakes, necessarily diverting an accumu-
lated discharge of water through the channel of New River, may
alone counteract the operations of the sea on its entrance—

The above estimate is founded on the labor being performed by
soldiers receiving only their extra pay—
Should it be deemed advisable to open the road for the present only
to Smyrna, the route of the road marked, will have to be abandoned
at the Tomoka ferry and the old Kings road followed or a more
eastern route selected so as to cross spruce creek at or near its connec-
tion with the Halifax *—The facilities however of crossing this creek
from its width & margins of marsh are diminished on approaching its
mouth-on the old Kings road there is the remains of a causeway
which may be repaired without much labor—I am inclined however to
the opinion that the superior advantages of a more eastern route will
more than counterbalance any greater difficulties which may be en-
countered from crossing the creek still nearer its mouth—If the road
be opened to Smyrna it may be continued at a very inconsiderable
expense, should it be deemed important, along the high ridge of the
South Halifax Sound to the Hawlover at Indian River; thus avoiding
the bad cypress swamps near the heads of this stream—The great
wedth of Indian river at the Haulover and for many miles above,
presenting more the appearance of an inland sea, is the only objection
to the selection of this direction for a road to Cape Florida In other
respects, for that distance, it possesses a decided preference over the
route surveyed & marked—Crossing Indian river at this point how-
ever, the road would be continued from thence on the survey which
has been made—It may be here necessary to state that I do not con-

Smyrna, which was regarded as the only portion of the country south of St. Augus-
tine then worthy of attention. An act approved Mar. 2, 1827 (4 STAT. 227)
authorized the employment of United States troops in opening and repairing
the road, for which purpose the sum of $11,000 was appropriated.

direct line which might be necessary to avoid obstacles & for the
selection of the best ground—This operation would have required a
more minute examination of the whole country than was practicable
with the exploring party under my command, and the unavoidable
disasters which interrupted our early movements, and can be better
performed by the Road makers keeping always in advance & on the
flanks of the laborers, a small intellegent examining party—Such was
the character of the country in many places, that it was impossible to
keep on ground where the road ought to run—A thick impenetrable
growth of saw palmetto, bay, scrub & briar bushes matted together,
often forced my party to seek a passage through ponds and Savannahs
and abandon the higher grounds thus obstructed for the lower lands
where the water only had been able to check the luxurient growth of
these southern latitudes—
From the detail now furnished, you will be able to form your own
opinion as to the cost, practicability & advantages of a road from S'
Augustine to Cape Florida agreeably to the examination which has
been made under an Act of Congress—Whatever differences of opinion
may be entertained on the subject to the whole extent, none I hope
will exist as to the great necessity of opening immediately the high
way south as far as New Smyrna—The route of the Kings road may
be selected which will require little more expense than for the repairs
of the old causeways and bridges over the smaller branches and
creeks—To extend however as much as practicable the benefits of
this communication; and to open a passage for Emigrants to the At-
lantic as well as western coast of a Territory the populating of which
is a policy of national importance, I would suggest to your considera-
tion the propriety of commencing operations at the S" Marys river,
so that the road may branch from Georgia, west to the Bay of Tampa
as has been sanctioned by appropriation, and east along the Atlantic
border to the extent which may be approved—The immediate opera-
tion as far as New Smyrna will be necessarily connected with any
subsequent extension of the communication to the Cape which the
Government of the US may think advisable and will cost as estimated
11,000 dollars divided thus—
From S*Marys to S*Augustine 5000
“ S*Augustine to Tomoka 4000
“ Tomoka to Smyrna 2000

The communication to Cape Florida may be extended hereafter either
by opening and improving the inland passage by the lakes & sounds
which have been described or by the road which has been surveyed-

settle south of the Moschetto the inland communication would be
preferable; and I am inclined individually to the opinion it would
even prove so for all military defensive operations which events might
render necessary—A road sufficiently practicable for rapid military
movements and for the necessary unimpeded transportation of heavy
ordance baggage waggons &c south of Smyrna could not be constructed
but at a cost greatly exceeding the estimate which has been furnished,
with a continued annual expence to keep it in a proper state of repair—
The population on the route will probably never be sufficient to con-
tribute to this important object; while the inducements to Individuals
to keep up the necessary ferries will scarcely ever be adequate—
This communication contains however, only the hasty observations
and speculations of an Individual on a country made under many
unfavourable circumstances—However just may be his inferences
from the existing state of things as to the uncertainty of the immediate
concentration of a population south of the Moschetto it is not im-
probable that the improvement in the science of agriculture, now
attracting general attention, and the discovery of some new southern
staple, the unknow value of some native production with the success-
ful introduction of fruits tropical & European adapted to a climate
supplying the difficiences of a light sandy soil, connected with the
inexhaustable reservoirs of valuable fish, extensive ranges for cattle,
and a sea beach annually enriched by the misfortunes of the enter-
prising; may as these combined objects of fruit fish, Stock and wreck-
ing, under a mild & salubrious climate present strong allurements to
emigrant adventurers and particularly to a class of Citizens whose
capital being tonage; and where ploughing is confined to the deep,
may convert Cape Florida and the Coast into a Southern nursery for
Seamen—The object therefore of opening a communication to the
southern extremity of Florida whether by the inland passage noticed
in this communication, or by the road which has been surveyed will
it is hoped be steadily held in view as connected with those great in-
ternal national works now attracting general attention & which have
become identified with the most approved policy of the Republic."

GEN" LAND OFFICE September 15th 1825
COL ROBERT BUTLER Surveyor Gen' &c near Nashville Tennessee
SIR, On reference to the money advanced to you for Surveying I
find that it exceeds the amount of the estimate made to Congress.
Our estimate was for One hundred Townships to be paid for in the
present year and the amount advanced is $40.500 being ten or Eleven
thousand dollars more than the estimate. It is not contemplated
to have more than two sales in the year 1826. one in the Spring and
one in the Autumn, each sale to consist of not more than twenty five
Townships, the first sale will I presume include the Chipola Lands
and I presume the fifty Townships if well selected will embrace all
those parts of West Florida which may be required to be brought into
market to meet the demands of the settlers, Emigrants & other
purchasers for the ensuing year."
It is desirable that all the Township lines in West Florida should
be completed, so that the private claims may be laid off, whenever
they shall be confirmed by Congress, but it will not be necessary to
Section off more lands than will be equal to 50 complete Townships
annually hereafter in West Florida.
It is desirable that the Lands in East Florida between the Suwannee
and Atlantic and adjacent to the Georgia line should be surveyed
into Townships and that twenty Townships of the best of these
Lands which may be clear of private claims & the most demanded
by purchasers should be prepared for sale previous to December
1826. As it is probable that the Surveying of the private claims in
West Florida may be commenced as soon in the Autumn of 1826 as
the Surveyors can venture to survey it will be proper for you to make
some estimate of the expences for surveying on that account. You
will with as little delay as possible forward the Township plats of the
Surveying executed and charged in your accounts, as those accounts
cannot be settled until they are forwarded."
With Great respect—Yr Obt Sert

TO THE REGISTER AND RECEIVER OF LAND OFFICE Tallahassee

GENTLEMEN, It having been deemed advisable not to offer at public
sale any Lands in Florida until the Spring of 1826, I have to request
that you will state to me the particular period when it would be most
advisable to proclaim the Lands for Sale, and which would be most
convenient to purchasers. You will also state the particular Town-
ships that it would be most advisable to bring into market at the Spring
sales. It is contemplated to offer twenty five complete Townships
for sale in the Spring and an equal quantity in the Autumn of 1826.
The townships and fractional townships best settled and most in
demand should be first brought into market whether contiguous to
each other or not.”
With great respect &c

The changeable character of the lands in Florida, and the recently
discovered value of the pine lands will I am pursuaded render impolitic
the existence of the Law which forbids the Sectioning of “a large
body of poor unsaleable land” as it leaves a construction so broad
that much good land will remain unsectioned from an examination
of the exterior boundary of Townships, & the appearance of a difficult
swamp may induce a report on the part of the Surveyor that it is
usaleable—I have heard that this has been done in Freemans Dis-
trict”—I am informed that the pine lands in the neighborhood of
Tallahassee are entering rapidly, and I have no doubt but Florida is
destined to sustain a population much larger than its warmest friends
have heretofore admitted probable.

A letter of the 29" ult” is rec" from the P. M. at Pindertown G*

required to forward to you the Eastern mail from Tallahassee—which
he says he did on the 26" July. He represents however, that the
mail you sent from Tallahassee was Contained in a pair of saddlebags
which had the appearance of being Sealed—but that the Seal was
broken. It is also represented to have been too Small. Both these

from the facts of a key haveing been sent to all the Offices on the

provided for immediate service “a strong portmanteau”.” The
P. M. at Pindertown further alleges that he wrote to you informing
you of the time of opening the Hartford & Montgomery mail at his

proceeded to the Indian Springs for the recovery of his health.

SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith, in Compliance with
instructions from the Superintendant of Indian Affairs for the Terri-
tory; a Plat of the Scite selected for the Indian Agency, together with
a plan of a House & an estimate * of the probable expence of erecting
it, and the other necessary buildings:—the estimate was made by an
experienced practical mechanic; who is well acquainted with all
the natural facilities of the place for an undertaking of the kind; he
thinks his estimate is full low, and that it will probably fall short of
the actual expence.—He has, however, I am satisfied, overrated, and
I doubt not, that with the sum named, a Council House, might be
erected in addition to the other appurtenances,
The importance of having such an establishment (separate and
distinct from the private dwelling) for the transaction of public
business, is, I trust, sufficiently obvious, to render argument upon the
subject, unnecessary:—
The land embraced in the Survey forwarded, is generally (as you
will perceive by the map) Hammoc of good quality & well adapted
to the more valuable products of the Southern Country, and from
the elevated situation of the region immediately surrounding it, war-
rants the expectation of as much health as falls to the lott of the
Territory generally:—The Scite, however, appears most valuable and
important as an Agency, on account of its localities; being immediately
at the North end of the Big Swamp, or Hammock; in the direct line
of communication, between the Indian & White population of the
Territory: thus giving in an extensive degree, the power to regulate
and controul the intercourse between them, which without the bar-
rier might be carried on to the great detriment of the Indian as well
as the Territory; in addition to this, a good water communication,

may, with small expence, be opened, from the Silver Spring; which
you will see laid down on the paper bearing the plat Sent:—This
Spring is about three miles from the centre of the plat, and has a
Sufficient depth of Water, for all the purposes of large Boat naviga-
tion: it was unknown, as I learn, to the white inhabitants of the
Territory; until Since my visit to this quarter, for the purpose of
locating the Agency; which I should have fixed in the immediate
vicinity of it, but for the lack of good land, for cultivation, which
according to the understanding I have of the views of the govern-
ment, in relation to the introduction of improvements in agriculture
among the Indians; appeared an indispensable requisite:—I have
had an intelligent person employed in examing the water route above
named: for the purpose of ascertaining the practicability of estab-
lishing a good navigation; and also to procure such information as
would furnish me with suitable data, upon which to form an estimate
of the expence of removing such obstructions as now exist in the
passage. He has, as yet, reported only verbally; but his report
favours my most sanguine expectation: & I feel assured, that with
the inconsiderable sum of $300 a perfectly good & easy navigation
might be opened; which in transportation alone, would save the gov-
ernment, annually, treble that amount; & I should feel a pleasure in
receiving orders to make the improvement.—
I take occasion to suggest before closing, that early instruction in
relation to building, are desireable, as the Season most favourable
for labour, is close at hand.”—

nine hides, part of her cargo, for an alleged violation of the 50" Sec-
tion of the Act of the Congress of the U. States “to regulate the col-
lection of duties on imports and tonnage.”
Abstract of Answer and Claim.
On the 16" of said May, the Answer and claim of Thomas Griffin,
Prize master of said Felucca, was filed, claiming said vessel &c. as
lawful prize to the Columbian brig El Vencedor, an armed vessel,
duly commissioned by the Republic of Columbia, at War with Spain,
to capture Spanish subjects and property.
Abstract of Evidence.
On the trial, commencing on the fourth monday of said May, it
was proved, that on the 25" of April preceding, the said Felucca was
first discovered by the pilots of the river St. John's, near the mouth of
said river—that she was, by said pilots conducted into, and anchored
in the waters of the S" John's—that on the 28" of said April, she
was found, by an Officer of the revenue, aground, her cable cut, her
hatches open, and that part of her cargo, included in the Libel,
landed and secreted on shore—& that the vessel and goods, found on
shore, were then seized by the said revenue officer. It was also,
further proved, that said goods were landed, without a permit, that
on the seizure of the vessel, the crew thereof left her, and were no
more seen in Florida. That Thomas Griffin the Prize-Master and
claimant, before the landing of said goods, had left the vessel, being
too sick to continue in charge of her, the officer next in rank remain-
ing on board till after the she was seized, in behalf of the U. States,
as aforesaid—It was proved that the articles landed without a per-
mit, were of the full value of $400, at the place where landed.
Abstract of the Sentence and Decree.
On the 10" of June 1825, the Court decreed, on evidence, of which
the foregoing is an abstract, that the said Felucca Providencia, her
tackle, apparel and furniture, together with the said ten barrels of
Coffee, six bags of Cocoa, two barrels of Rum and one hundred and
twenty nine hides, be condemned as forfeited to the United States.
The above and the foregoing, is a faithful abstract of the case of
the U States versus the Felucca Providencia &c.

SIR, I have this day returned from the Survey of the road to
Wantons,” I find the distance about one hundre and forty miles, The
Country from this to the North branch of the Ouithlacocha river
fifty miles, is very low and wet, I had much difficulty in finding a place
sufficiently high to bridge that stream after examing for several
miles up & down the stream I have found a position where a bridge
will rest secure, besides the two branches of this stream the two
branches of the Hillsborough river, and Thlo noto Sassa Creek all
very considerable streams will require bridges, beyond that the
country is generally undulating pine lands, very little will be required
but to remove the Timber.
The Country affords no Supplies except a little corn, in the Alachua
settlement. All the Supplies must be transported from this place
in waggons, and on pack horses, this will be the most difficult part
in opening the road. I have made a requisition on Cap" Burch
for two more Teams, with Waggons, which will not arrive before
the last of October, I shall not wait their arrival but move on by the
10" with what Teams I have.
The funds necessary to pay the men for extra labor, for forage
and other contingent expenses will probably amount to $5.000 which

SIR, Enclosed herewith, are my accounts for the two quarters
ending 30" June & 30: Sept: the former has been once to St: Augus-
tine, as I presumed it might without difficulty, be forwarded to you
from that place; dissappointed however, in this, it was brought back
to be Sent to your Office from here—thus much is said in explanation
of the delay.—
It will not be possible for me to forward the annuity accounts until
near the close of Nov. All my efforts, (which have been many) to
induce the Indians, to go to Tampa Bay to receive their goods, have
failed & I am at last compelled to haul them to this place, on which
service, I have a team now employed. The Indians evince a disin-
clination to receive the goods; though they have concluded to take
them, if brought here; they say they are entitled to their annuity in
Money, and that they wish it; and I doubt very much, whether they
can be induced to accept a Second Stipend, in any thing else.—There
are already numerous petty dealers in Whiskey & other articles,
settled near our borders, who will fail (in part at least) of their expected
booty, if goods are issued to the Indians, in lieu of Cash, & they it is
presumable, will be unsparing in their exertions, to induce the Indians
to refuse Goods; indeed the latter have already given me to under-
stand, that they shall expect the next payment in Cash; and have
requested me so to say; and whether it would be Politic or just for
the Government to disregard their wishes in this respect, is a question
certainly entitled to consideration. I am clearly of opinion that

good if judiceously laid in, would be of infinitely more service to them,
than the small amount to which they are entitled, would be, if paid
in money. I am nevertheless, equally clear in the opinion, that it is
entirely optional with them, to Say which they will receive—How
far it may be proper, or wise, to force their inclination in Such a
matter, even with a view to their benefit, is not for me to determine."
You will notice one Charge in my abstracts for this quarter for
Moneys paid for Clerk hire; this expenditure is one for which I
rather ask than claim credit: the accumulated, & I may say extra-
Official duties, which have fallen to my share, for the last few months;
have forced me to the necessity of employing a Clerk; the price of
whose hire I cannot doubt will be admitted among my other dis-
bursements—I have written to the Department of War, for authority
to remove at the Public expence, the obstructions in a Stream head-
ing near the Agency & communicating with the St. Johns River,
by way of the Okelewaha, for the purpose of opening a navigation,
that will enable me to procure the necessary supplies for the Station,
upon infinitely better terms for the Government than it has hitherto
been possible for me to do; * the very great expense of transportation
to which we have unavoidably been subjected, will hereafter, if the
arrangement proposed, is effected; be, I am convinced more than one
half saved; the costs of labor & others incident to the undertaking,
will not exceed; it is confidently believed $.300. Treble this amount
it is probable would be annually saved in transportation alone. In
the event of instructions being received, to consumate the plan I
have suggested, a boat will be a necessary appendage to the Agency;
to purchase which your authority will be requisite. the probable
price will be about $.100. It will be seen by my accounts that funds
for the Agency are necessary M. Gary who has made his last issues &
is employed to convey my letters to you, will on his return, afford a
Safe and good opportunity for sending them to me.—M" Gary I
presume expects while at Tallahassee, to Settle his Accounts with
the Government & receive payment for his Services, as issuing Officer,
at Hamley's Old Store on the St: Johns. I take occasion to offer the
opinion, that his compensation, which I understand has not been
fixed, should be liberal, as his duties have been greatly arduous owing
to his having been several times called into the Nation to attend to
the receipt and averaging of the Cattle delivered by the Contractor &
to the great amount of Issues made at his post. Those duties it is

SIR, After experiencing numerous embarassments in my intercourse
with the Indians embraced within my Agency, for the want of an
inteligent & competent Interpreter; I was induced in June last, during
your absence from Tallahassee to direct M Marsh, the Sub Agent,
(whom I found it necessary to Send to the Creek Agency to confer
with Col. Crowell * on the Subject of Slave property, in dispute
between individuals of the two Nations,) to procure one if a Suitable
one could be found; and with a view to induce Such an one to engage,
I authorised M. Marsh to Say, that the Same compensation would

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE October 3° 1825.—
GENERAL, Having informed myself as to the shortest practicable
Route for the Road from the St. Mary's River to Wanton’s I have
published proposals accordingly for opening it by contract, a copy of
which is enclosed.” The Country through which this Road will pass
is low & flat, and will require more labor to open it with proper
Bridges & Causeways than I had formerly supposed. I have already
ascertained that bids for the contract need not be expected for less
than from ten to twelve thousand dollars. I therefore deemed it
proper to invite proposals for opening the Road & putting it in practi-
cable travelling order only, as specified in the latter part of the Ad-
vertisement. For if the Road is opened in this manner there would
be no difficulty in travelling it in the dry seasons, the Streams which
it crosses being fordable at such times; and when the rainy Seasons
swell the Streams to swimming, Travellers on horseback, and even
Carts & Light-waggons, would be able to pass, having good footways
over them, almost as easily & safely, though not so expeditiously, as
if they were Bridged. The Sum now appropriated is fully adequate
for opening the Road in this manner; and for all immediate practical
purposes, would I am convinced be as useful as if opened in any other
mode. Inasmuch as it would neither interfere with any subsequent
contract for completing the Road with its Bridges & Causeways, nor
yet augment the expense of finally finishing it; I beg leave respectfully
to recommend for your consideration whether it would not be ad-
visable to close a contract for opening & making it a practicable
Road without delay; though it ought, in my opinion, to be fully com-
pleted in the end, in the same manner as the Road will be from Pensa-
cola to St: Augustine.—It is more than probable that the same person

who takes the first contract for opening the Road will also, if it should
be required thereafter, undertake its completion on being paid the
difference between the two amounts proposed for. I request you will
be pleased to instruct me on this subject, addressed to me at Pensa-
cola, in order that I may, if approved by you, be prepared when I
receive the proposals on the 10" day of December next, to close the
contract for opening this Road."—
If it is decided to complete the Road afterwards with the requisite
Bridges & Causeways, it will require an additional appropriation of
five thousand dollars for completing that part of the Road opening
under my direction."—

[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla:LS *]
Office of the Sup: of Ind: Aff: for Florida,
TALLAHASSEE, October 6* 1825.—
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 10" of August last,” by the way of Pensacola.—
I have not as yet made any extra provision for the Emigrant
Indians of this Territory out of the two thousand dollars allotted for
that purpose, intending to husband it with the utmost economy as a
dernier resort, to be used only in cases of absolute necessity:—the
Sum is in itself so small as to be of no utility if expended in a general
manner.-
Many of these Indians, resident in the Reserve East of the Suwan-
nee River, have recently abandoned their country; and I have received
information upon which reliance is to be placed, that most, if not
all, of those who formerly resided between the Rivers Suwannee &
Appalachicola are on their return hither. They state to me as a reason
for their return, that they have always been furnished with a scanty
supply of provisions only & which has sometime since ceased alto-
gether; that they have no means of subsistence within themselves;
that there is no game in their country; that it is moreover exceedingly
unhealthy, exposing them to sickness and inevitable death; and in
fine, that no part of the country allotted to them for a residence is of

such a description as to afford them comfortable settlements; or of
such a quality as will enable them either to have stocks or to raise
corn. I have myself never been in that part of Florida, but from
information that I rely upon, I am inclined to believe that all that the
Indians represent respecting its unhealthiness & want of fertility of
soil is strictly correct, and requires, in justice to them, to be thoroughly
investigated. Many complaints from the Indians respecting their
Rations had reached me early in the Spring, and when the Agent
was here in May last I informed him of the reports & complaints
that had been made to me, all of which he assured me were utterly
false & without foundation.” I then pressed earnestly upon him
the absolute necessity of his paying an immediate & particular atten-
tion to tranquilizing the Indians; of endeavoring to dispose them to
form permanent Settlements on the best lands within their Reserve;
and of seeing that they were supplied with provisions according to
the means at his disposal; and ended, by directing him to return to
the Agency forthwith to carry these objects into effect;—trusting
that his personal presence & efforts with the Indians would operate
favourably in disposing them to acquiesce in the views of the Govern-
ment & relieve their distresses. I regret however that I am compelled
to State that these complaints and reports still continue in an in-
creased degree; and are urged by the Indians in justification of their
abandoning their own country and returning to the vicinity of their
late Settlements.—
This district of Country, (formerly in the occupancy of the Indians,)
has been surveyed, in part sold, and is rapidly populating; and if the
Indians cannot be restrained within their limits, occurrences of an
unpleasant nature between them and the white inhabitants must
infallibly ensue:—complaints against them having been already
made for depredations committed upon the Stocks of cattle & fields
of Corn belonging to the whites. But as Gov" Duval is daily expected
to arrive in the Territory to resume the Government thereof, I do
not think it either proper or decorous for me to enter at length upon
the present situation of the Indians, & their causes of dissatisfaction
and complaint, which are both of a local and permanent character;
and will, in my opinion, to be thoroughly removed, require a total
change in the measures hitherto pursued towards them. So soon as
the Governor arrives I shall make him fully acquainted with their
actual situation, & with my views in relation thereto, leaving it to his
experience and better judgement to decide what measures will be
most proper to pursue towards them; and you may therefore confi-
dently calculate upon being early addressed by him on this subject.

Bays, and Inlets on the West-Coast of Cape Florida as far as the East
End of Rose Island, & if at any place during your cruises, you shall
find any Vessel or Vessels engaged in illicit commerce, or unprovided
with such documents as are required by Law—you will seize such,
Vessel or Vessels and send them in charge of an Officer to the nearest
Port for adjucation.
As Vessels are frequently wrecked on the Florida-Keys—you are
to consider it a part of your duty, if requested by the Master or
Supercargoe, to assist in preserving their Cargoes, but if the Wessel &
Cargoe shall have been abandoned by the Crew, you will, after taking
on board as much as the Cutter can contain, Ship the Residue on
board of any American Wessel, the Cap" signing an obligation to
deliver it at such Port as you shall designate. For your further
information however on this subject, I have to call your attention
to the enclosed copy of an Act entitled “An Act concerning wrecks
on the coast of Florida” passed on the 3" of March 1825 *
There being reason to apprehend that great depration is committed
on the public Lands in East and West Florida by cutting and carrying

subject in question.” As neither Thompsons Island nor indeed any
part of the main Land can furnish supplies of any kind. it will be
advisable to take 6 months provisions with you, and when those are
nearly consumed you must proceed to Mobile, & apply to the Col-
lector, who will be instructed to furnish on your estimate, the funds
required to procure supplies and to pay the crew—for which you are
subsequently to account to him, as also on your arrival at Mobile for
the money advanced to you by the Collector of Baltimore.
The crew of the Cutter exclusive of Officers is not to exceed fifteen
men, a cook, steward, and two Boys, and when paid ev'ry man must
sign a receipt opposite to his name—on a Pay-Roll certified to be
correct by the Cap" and his Officers. It will also be proper that a
copy of your journal verified in like manner—should be forwarded to
this Office at the end of ev'ry month if opportunitys should offer.
It is also proper to apprize you that without previous approbation
of this Department no alterations can be made in the Cutter, nor any
expence incurred for objects other than the ordinary supplies, except
in the event of the loss of spars, sails, anchors, & cables. It is also
to be understood that unless authorized as above stated, the Cutter
must not be absent from her cruising ground on any pretence, exceept
driven therefrom by stress of weather or, for the purpose of procuring
supplies at Mobile.
For your further instruction in regard to your public duties, I have
to refer you to the enclosed copy of a circular letter addressed to the
Capt's of Revenue Cutters on the 13" July 1819,” and remind you
of the absolute necessity, of taking receipts for all disbursements
made by you for the use of the Cutter Service, as vouchers upon an
adjustment of your accounts with the Collector at Mobile.
I will only further add that as the Officers of Revenue-Cutters, are
deemed to be attached to the Customs, a copy of Brice's Revenue
Laws will be very useful to you, They were published in Baltimore,
& can probably be had in any of the Book stores at that place. The
expense of it will be allowed.

TREASURY
[NA:GLO, PLC, Fla., Lets. Recd. from Individuals:ALS]
AMIENS 15* October 1825 Chateau de la Vallée
SIR I have the honor to address you on the subject of a claim to
land held by me, under the Spanish government in East Florida.
By the extension, during the last Session, of an Act of Congress
entitled “An Act for ascertaining claims to land in the Floridas,”" the
Commissioners are required to furnish the Secretary of the Treasury,
with a report of the result of their investigation, on or before the 1"
of November next, in order that the same may be laid before the
Legislature of the Union for ulterior proceedings thereon.
In November 1817 the Spanish government of East Florida engaged
to make me, upon certain onerous conditions, a considerable concession
of waste lands,” & the fact of that engagement was one of public
notoriety, but the issuing of the grant was delayed until the 26 of
feby: 1818 in consequence of my absense at Savannah & Charlston,
& waiting my return to S' Augustine;—at that time no injurious
consequences were anticipated from the procrastination.
In the ensuing Season my Attorney & cooperator, the late Mr
James Alexander (who died in the Province) proceeded to S*Augustine,
with others from New York, to carry into effect the terms of my
contract, while I embarked for Europe upon the same object, & in
compliance with the conditions annexed to my concession. Mr

Alexander & myself were occupied in these transactions when the
preliminary Convention for the cession of the Floridas, of the 19 of
feb 1819," ratified by the United States, was promulgated; wherein
by a clause of the 8" Article, of retrospective operation, my grant
appeared from its date, to be abrogated, & in the absence of all in-
formation as to the circumstances which gave rise to the clause, I was
constrained, notwithstanding the apparent injustice of the case, to
relax in a great degree, my proceedings under the grant.
In the mean time however, settlements had been commenced,
& unwilling to relinquish the equity of my title, were continued on
my behalf, by my Agents Mess" Alexander, Mitchel, & Dexter;" at
Velutia " on Lake George, & at Vibrillia on the river St Johns, by a
Mr Dean near Lake Dunn, while a certain number of individuals
conducted by a Mr Riz," (now at S*Augustine) were engaged by me
in England, to form the nucleus of another settlement. In fact the
proceedings under the grant were such as fully entitled me to the
protection of the government of Florida, & from the Spanish author-
ities I possess documentary evidence to support those pretensions.
At the opening of the Session of 1819 the President communicated
to Congress a detail of the negotiation," & stated the cause of the
delay on the part of Spain, in the ratification of the convention,
which, it may be contended, had ceased to exist, by lapse of time,
& the renunciation of its terms, by Mr Forsyth," the Special Minister
of the Union at Madrid.
The documents connected with the convention embracing the
various correspondence it produced, were laid before Congress,
& published by its authority." Those documents demonstrated the
quo animo of the negotiation with respect to the abrogating clause
of the 8"Art:, & contained certain pledges, by Mr Secretary Adams,
on the part of the United States government, as to his limitation of
the abrogation “that the Federal government would most assuredly,
never entertain the idea of disturbing individuals who were vested
with a bona fide title to their property;-In fact & in truth, the whole
of the correspondence respecting the res gesta in the clause was con-
firmed by the tenor of the Presidents Message in 1819 which declared,
adverting to the intended abrogation of the grants, the subject of

controversy with the Spanish government “It was the intention of
the parties to annul these latter grants, & that clause was drawn for
that express purpose, & for none other.”
With the subsequent history of the Treaty you are Sir doubtless
acquainted,—The King of Spain ratified its contents in October 1821,
but substituted for the obnoxious clause of the 8 Article, a Declaration
explaining its original intention but stating that its object had been
accomplished in another manner, namely by an especial annulment
of the disputed grants.
Notwithstanding this instrument of substitution, which effectually
nullified the operation of the clause in the 8 Art.; an Act of Congress
was passed in 1821 & 2 constituting a Commission to investigate titles
to land in Florida," & the Commissioners were restricted to the
examination of titles preceeding the 24" of Jan”: 1818, & no provision
whatever was made with respect to those of a subsequent date. To
this omission I had the honor of soliciting the attention of Mr Secretary
Adams on the 16 of Jan”: 1823,” at Washington, & at the same time
of enquiring whether any measure was contemplated by the Executive
for the relief of those whose interests were omitted in the provisions of
the Act? Mr Adams replied in the negative, stating that the subject
was one peculiarly belonging to the Legislature.”
Combining Sir all the circumstances connected with this case,
namely The inception of the grant in 1817, The declared views of the
Negotiators in framing the clause of the 8 Art: & of its limited in-
tention, with the language of the Presidents Message in 1819 (pro-
fessing at least a verbal recognition of my title) together with the
impression that the Declaration of the King of Spain must be taken
as a substitute for the clause, which remained proforma only in the
Treaty, I respectfully submit to you Sir, that I am justified in con-
sidering the integrity of my possession unimpeached by the Treaty,
& that it is entitled on the contrary to the respect of the United
States government.
I have the honor Sir to transmit this to you, as an evidence of my
continued pretensions, in case any general measure shall be enacted,
during my absence, for the relief of the very few titles affected by the
clause, & I shall present myself at the seat of government, so soon as
I shall ascertain the final termination of the present Commission; in
the mean time I feel confident that the United States will adopt
toward me, & those similarly situated, a liberality of conduct con-
sistent with their National honor, & due to the Citizens of a great

Office of the Sup: of Ind:Aff: for Florida—
TALLAHASSEE, October 18" 1825,
SIR, Your letter of the 15" Ult° directing the extension of the
Indian Boundary lines of their Southern Reserve in this Territory,
was received yesterday."—
In regard to the extension of these lines I have to State that the
Agent is under a misapprehension as to the place granted to the
Indians, in consequence of which Some of the Indians have as I
understand been improperly located; and which has given rise to
his report, alluded to in your letter, that Settlements of Whites were
forming within the Indian limits.—In the Alachua (a district of
country So denominated,) there are two places which from a partial
Similarity of names have been frequently confounded with each
other; the one is called the Big Swamp and lies North of, but near
to, the Indian Northern Boundary line; the other is called the Big
Hammock and lies near to, and West of, the Indian lands. The
Agent contends for the occupation of the former under the Presidents
order, but an extension of the lines according to that order cannot
be made So as to embrace it, and will, when made, include only the
latter.—This was fully explained to the Agent while at this place in
May last; and Col: Gadsden, who was then also present, demonstrated

President, who it is evident by comparing his order with the map

and yet it seems from your letter that the Agent (for he has never
thought proper to address me on the Subject nor to inform me of
intrusions by White Settlers on the Indian lands,) Still persists in
his erroneous construction of the order in question; the only grounds
that can be assumed for which is, that in the Presidents order the
term Big Hammock or Swamp is used; (in your letter of the 15"
Ulto: it is more definite being called the Big Hammock only;) but
then the slightest reference to the manner in which the lines are
ordered to be extended leaves not the shadow of doubt as to which
of the two is meant.—It is however proper at the Same time to State
that the Indians themselves have always contended for the grant
of the Big Swamp, and this fact no doubt has measurably contributed
to continue the Agent in his error as to the place actually designated
for the occupancy of the Indians. And until I had conversed with

granted.—
As the matter now Stands the Inhabitants of Alachua, Some of
whom are Settled near to the Indian Northern boundary line, com-
plain loudly that the Indians are Suffered to locate on lands without
the limits of their Reserve; which is, and must continue to be, the
fact, unless the President shall be pleased to extend the Indian Bound-

to implicate me for some impropriety or other in the discharge of

Office of the Sup: of Ind: Aff: for Florida
TALLAHASSEE October 21* 1825.
SIR, I have the honor to enclose for your information a Report
made to me by M. Doyle respecting the Indians in Florida." This
Gentleman has resided for many years previous to, & since the
cession of Florida to the United States, amongst the Indians recently
inhabiting this section of the Territory; and is therefore not only ac-
quainted with the Indian character, & dispositions in general, but is
know personally to these Indians & their Chiefs. It had become
necessary for me to employ a confidential person to endeavor to
collect the fugitive Indians at some point, where my message &
orders could be communicated to them; and also to ascertain, as
far as practicable, directly from themselves their immediate causes
of complaint & their own views in regard to the future. From his
personal good character added to these reasons, I deemed M. Doyle
to be the most suitable agent I could engage in this business, & he
was accordingly employed by me, & will be continued in employ-
ment, if necessary, until I am relieved in the exercise of the Gov"
of the Territory by Gov: Duval; or am instructed by the Dept: as
to the measures proper to be pursued, which I shall anxiously expect.
In the mean time I have determined, as the only course left to save
these Indians from Starvation & the Settlements from exposure to
depredations from them, caused only by their necessiteious condi-
tion, to place M” Doyle at, or near, the Suwanne River, with the
double object of preventing the Indians from entering the Settle-

reported steps taken to remove Indians from the vicinity of Tallahassee; among
these was Hadjo, Chief of the Tallahassee, who removed with his band to the
south. Doyle analyzed the reasons for discontent among the Florida Indians.
See also McKenney to DuVal, Oct. 31, 1825 (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 2, printed
A. S. P., op. cit., p. 639), that he was directed by the Secretary of War to call
DuVal's attention to Acting Governor Walton's letter relative to Indian com-
plaints (Oct. 6, 1825, ante, p. 335) and to report on the capacity of the land as-
signed them.

ments of the Whites; and to furnish them with Some Supplies of
Corn for their wives and Children.—
I am convinced they cannot be concentrated within their limits
without the aid of Military force, unless some means of subsistence
be there provided for them, in which case I believe they would comply
with whatever might be required of them. From representations
made to me on which I can rely, the situation of these unfortunate
human beings is miserable in the extreme, & requires prompt &
effectual relief from the humanity, if not from the justice, of the
Government; and which I trust will be extended to them.—
If the President shall deem it expedient, I consider the present
moment as one favorable for holding a Treaty with the Florida
Indians, having for its object their immediate removal to lands
West of the Mississippi River, either in a body as a nation by them-
selves or to be incorporated with the Creek Nation in their con-
templated removal. So far as it regards obtaining the consent of
the Indians, (not only those in the Southern reserve but of those
on the Appalachicola River,) I believe either of the proposed plans
to be feasible.—Such a measure would be productive of the most
important advantages to themselves, by fixing their location per-
manently in a healthy & productive district of Country, & in ameli-
orating their present distressed & dissatisfied condition; and like-
wise be of incalculable advantage to the interests of the Territory
itself—In suggesting, & recommending this measure to the Govern-
ment, I am confident in the expression of the opinion, that I Speak
the views and Sentiments of Governor Duval; and not only of his
but those of the most enlightened & intelligent men in the Territory—
Beleiving that this measure if properly pursued will arrive at the
happiest results in effecting a more favorable location for these
Indians than their present one, I deem it important that in the event
of a Treaty being held, it should be conducted by persons having no
private interests or feelings to consult, and who are acquainted with
the Indian Character & known personally to the Chiefs.”—

GEORGE W. WARD TO GEORGE GRAHAM

TALLAHASSEE October 21* 1825
DEAR SIR Your letter of the 6" of September * came to hand
mail before last together with y' circular on the subject of Office
furniture.
Your enquiries in regard to the half Section of land adjoining
Tallahassee belonging to the Marquis La, Fayette would have been
sooner answered only for the indisposition of Gen Call who has been
for several weeks past and is yet confined by severe indisposition we
wished to have examined that tract of land together before we wrote
but his protracted illness has kept it out of his power. I have ex-
amined it as well as the thickets that cover it will permit and find it
a valuable piece of land and think it certainly will afford convenience
to the inhabitants of Tallahassee to have it sold out in the manner
proposed, and I should suppose restricted as they are from using the
timber on the reserves near town that it would bring a pretty fair
price even at an early period, yet it seems most likely that it would
bring more at the time of the next land sale (when it is expected there
will be a great deal of money here) than at an earlier period. it lies
adjoining Tallahassee in the manner of the reserves and the Street
running through the centre of the town Eastward will pass longi-
tudinally through the centre of this half section. for your more
entire satisfaction I have requested George T. Ward to subjoin a
small platt which will more distinctly show you how it lies. Gen.'
Call desired me to say that when able he will also examine that land
and and write you in reply to your letter *

Lafayette which it is proposed to lay out in Town Lotts. This tract borders
immediately on Tallahassee and is within two or three hundred yards of the

command much more money than if the land was sold as a plantation.” See

DEAR SIR Your letter of the 5" of last month *enclosing the form
of a bond is received and shall be attended to on the return of Judge
Woodward who has gone to the sale of lotts in a town in Chipola.”
Also that of the 9" " acknowledging the receipt of our monthly return

on the subject of the next land sale. I am sorry to tell you that Gen.'
Call is too ill and has been for several weeks to attend to any business
I have had two conversations with him on the subject of your letter
and he requests me to write you that we entirely agree with your idea
that it is the most proper plan to bring first into market the lands
most settled and best improved without regard to Contiguity and that
according to this plan the Chipola including Holmes" valley certainly
has the first claims," and at his suggestion I have procured from the
Surveyors office a platt of that district of country containing twenty
four townships and six fr’ Townships binding on the Alabama line,
for some reason the fractions on the Georgia line were left unsold at
the May sale and perhaps for the same reason those might be omitted
which will leave the number of Townships one less than you con-
templated selling.
In regard to the time for holding the next sale we beg leave to
suggest to you the propriety of making the time a little earlier than
you speak of. we think the 10 or 15" of March would be better than
a later period. the Season for planting corn & Cotton is in all the
months of March April, & May, and if the Sale is as late as April or
May the Crops will be planted and in very many instances the planter
will be outbid and thrown on the mercy of the speculator or others
for his crop. which will be placing him in a very distressing situa-
tion at a season too late to raise any provision for his Support that
year. this would be avoided by selling these lands in March. the
Presidents advertisement will be seen and those whose means are
limited can if they choose defer planting until the sale is over and if

they were fortunate enough to obtain their settlements they could
still plant in good season and if they were outbid there would still be
time for them to rent or look out in some other way, for another
Settlement. we think there is something like this due to those
adventurous pioneers and particularly where it can be done without
injury to the treasury. Another reason for having it earlier is that
in April and May this country is deluged with rains and the water-
courses in Florida Alabama & lower part of Georgia are deep and
numerous and as yet there are very few boats or bridges. the same
cause in May last operated its full Share against the Sale
It will be in the power (ordinarily) of every provident man to have
the avails of his cotton in March, we are induced to believe there is
a great deal of money ready for the Chipola sale. Gen' Call desires

The required estimate shall be made and forwarded, together with
the return of Surveys lastly executed with all possible dispatch after
I reach Tallahassee, for which place I had contemplated setting out
in the first week of next month, but owing to a failure (from sickness of
hands) on the part of a Gentleman who contracted with me for the
building of a carriage for the conveyance of my family, I will probably
be delayed until the 15" or 18"
That the contracts for Surveying previous to appropriation, should
be conditional I had no doubt, but I did not feel myself at liberty to
alter the conditions of the contract it having been furnished me for
my guide—As the deputies under the contracts executed have de-
parted some time since for their completion, I shall probably not see
them until finished, I shall however write them and obtain by letter
their acquiescence in the condition which is now well understood by
them—I would however suggest that as soon as the appropriation
is made, the funds may be placed in my hands subject to disburse-
ment, as it is the wish of the Deputies generally to attend the next
land sale, hence this mony will revert back again immediately—The
difficulties suggested in your last letter with regard to compelling the
Deputies under the form of contract adopted to pay for incorrect
surveying, permit me to say does not exist, for the return of surveyors
explicitly states the period in which it was executed, and my indi-
vidual instructions to each Dep’ (copies of which are on file) point
out as near as may be, the ground they are to occupy, and the con-
tract itself requires the work to be executed within a given period,
and added to all which I have taken an individual bond of Ten
thousand Dollars with good security for the faithful performance of
all surveying assigned to each Deputy, under all which there can be
no possibility of escape—The latter precaution I have adopted,
growing out of a circumstance that transpired (as I have been informed)
in Freeman’s office, where returns under contract were regularly made
into the office well executed on paper, without a chain ever having
been stretched in the district assigned—On the subject of your re-
mark as to the size of the contracts, I have been governed in this
particular by a complaint on the part of the Deputies of their inability
to make any money under Small contracts from the difficulties of
the Country, the scarcity and consequent high prices of supplies,
and the destruction to horses and camp equipage—I am also of
opinion that it is a true maxim that business is better done when
there are few to do it, than when divided among many, provided the
amount to be done does not exceed the physical powers of the few—
I will however in all future contracts have regard to the Suggestion
made by you. The individual instructions given to the Deputies
now under contract, correspond with your views, as expressed in yours

SIR, I have received a letter from Col° Humphreys the Agent,”
accompanied by a plat of the grounds, and a plan for an Agency
House, which I have submitted to the Secretary of War. I am directed
to state, and so you will inform Col” Humphreys, that no exception
is taken to the plan, but that the cost–(5000 Doll") is inadmissible.
The maximum allowance for a building, and Council House, and all
necessary appendages, cannot be permitted to exceed two thousand

SIR, Your letter of 15" ultimo," accompanied by an extract of a
communication from the Commissioner of the General Land Office
to the Register at Jackson, Mississippi, was received by the last mail.
I do most sincerely regret, that any thing should have been omitted,
which was required by law, in order to legalize the purchases which I
made of lands at private sale. It was my anxious wish to execute
my duty with exactness and fidelity; and as it was new to me, I

acted more from the representations of others in the case before us,
than from impressions derived from the examination of any law. I
was not aware, indeed, that such a provision as the one contained in
the 10" Sect. of the Act of 10" May 1800” existed. All that was
necessary, as I understood the matter, was, that the Register was
bound to present his application to the Surveyor General, and agree
with him as to the price of the land, as others did with the Register,
when the applications were made at his Office. This was complied
with on my part, and the applications, signed by the Surveyor Gen-
eral, are now on file in the Register's office at Tallahassee. The
money was paid to the Receiver, and duplicate receipts taken as in
other cases, one of which I presume, has been already forwarded to
your Department.—
I have enclosed the Surveyor General your communication, re-
questing him to forward such a report as the one required to legalize
the sales. He has been urged to do so at as early a period as practi-
cable. In conclusion, I have to repeat, that the omission is a source
of great regret to me, and proceeded from an ignorance of the law.
As an evidence of my not being disposed to avail myself of any advan-
tage which my station might be supposed to afford, I declined making
an application for land until all those at the public sale had been
supplied and departed from Tallahassee. If the Department consider
the transaction, however, as involving the smallest impropriety, I
should greatly prefer a relinquishment of the land upon the mony's
being refunded.”—

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
PENSACOLA, November 18" 1825.
GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose for your consideration an
account of M. Crupper for his services in taking charge of Fort St.
Marks.” After the Post was evacuated & the property removed,
pursuant to my instructions to have the Fort & buildings taken care
of, it was my intention to have employed a man specially for that
purpose. But Capt. Crupper being at the time about to fix himself
in that part of the Country, I concluded to give it into his charge,
with liberty to occupy a building as a Store & dwelling. No stipula-
tion was made of any pay to him, though I stated to him that after
the Fort had been finally disposed of, I would, if it should appear
that the Fort & buildings were properly preserved, submit a reasonable
account for his services to you for payment.—I could not at the time
have got any other person to take charge of the Fort without a positive
agreement for payment. Colonel Clinch has several times mentioned
to me his opinion that some compensation ought to have been made,
and I enclose with the account an extract from his Report on the
subject of the Fort when turning it over to the Governor of the Terri-
tory. The account itself has been some months in my hands though
I have hitherto omitted to forward it.—
The post was occupied by a Company of the 4* Reg" from the 10"
of July to 27" Nov" during which time no allowance is made. If
the account is admitted, the claimant does not wish the payment of
the money here, but requests it may be passed to his credit at M"
Pleasonton’s Office.*—
* Not present. See ante, p. 267.
28 Answered Dec. 9, 1825 (NA, WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 8), that only $10
per month could be allowed Crupper for his services. See Del. White to the
Secretary of War, Jan. 11, 1826 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.), requesting a copy
of the report of the Chief Engineer declaring Ft. St. Marks useless for military
purposes, as he was thinking of requesting it for civil purposes; the Chief Engineer
to the Secretary of War, Jan. 16, 1826 (NA, WD, ED Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 3),
that no report had been made by the engineers declaring Ft. St. Marks useless,
because that part of Florida Territory had not yet been examined; the Secretary
of War to White, Jan. 28, 1826 (NA, WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 12), trans-
mitting to White the letter cited above; a resolution of the House of Representa-

any report of the Board of Engineers in that Department, declaring the post of St.

To THE HON” JAMES BARBOUR, Secretary of War,
SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith three letter's, two from
the acting Governor of Florida;" and the other a copy of a letter
addressed to him by M. Doyle, an agent sent by him to ascertain the
true state and condition of the Florida Indians.
There is no difficulty in adjusting the limits so as to take in the
Big Hammock. The line has already been directed to be so extended,
as to embrace it. But from the dissatisfaction which these Indians
have expressed from the commencement of their removal, and their
horror of the Country allotted to them, and its acknowledged
barreness and insalubrity, it is not reasonable to expect that there
will be any change in their dispositions, and feelings, unless the
Government undertake to feed them always.

construction of a wharf at Pensacola, again stated that the survey had not been
completed. See also act approved Mar. 2, 1833 (4 STAT. 664–665), to establish

Under such circumstances the suggestion made by M. Doyle and
M” Walton, of offering them a Country West of the Mississippi, is
respectfully recommended; and if approved, that the subject be
presented to the Creek delegation now here, and if agreeable to them,
that a provision be made in the contemplated Treaty for their union
and removal with that Tribe, which if agreed to by the Florida
Indians would settle and forever the existing difficulties.
It is possible however that the second extension of the Northern
line, Westwardly, so as to embrace the Big Hammock, and which
has been ordered, may satisfy them. If it is concluded best first to
ascertain this, and it should not, they could be Treated with after-
wards, leaving it with them to re-unite with the Creeks (as most of
them once belonged to this Tribe, and make their stipulations with
the Creeks for that object,) or settle upon lands, which themselves
may select in some other quarter of the Territory West of the Missis-
sippi. But their re-union with Creeks would be best.
All which is respectfully submitted.—

TO GEORGE WALTON, Esq." Secy & Act” Governor of Florida.—
SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 18" Ult° *
on the subject of the limits which are assigned for the emigrant Florida
Indians; and the documents in relation to them. To remove all
difficulty on this subject I have the honor to enclose a copy from the
Map.” The first extension of the Northern line Northwardly, from
the running by Col° Gadsden, limits I presume your views, and his,
of the case; but you will see that this extension of the Northern line,
North, has been subsequently ordered to be run in a Westerly direc-
tion to a point as indicated in the black lines, far enough West, as
that when an angle is made for a line to run from thence, to the “flat
lands filled with ponds,” it will embrace the Big Hammock. Will
not this extension furnish lands fit to be inhabitted, and of sufficient
productiveness and salubrity, to support the Indians? It was
Governor Duval's opinion, that it would.

[NA:ND, SN Misc. Lets. Recd.:LS 37]
WASHINGTON Nov. 28–1825.
SIR, I take the liberty to send for your perusal a memorial of the
first Legislative council of Florida and would respectfully request
your attention to the latter part in which the location of a Navy
Yard and Depot, at Pensacola, is recommended;” although you will
be more influenced in your selection of the place from the report of
the respectable and intelligent Naval Officers whom you have des-
patched to the plaee spot for the purpose of making an examination,
than from information acquired from any other and less official
source, yet there are some considerations presented that may in
some measure influence the future policy of the government in regard
to its extent and the means necessary to its defence should it be
located at that place. You will observe Sir, from an examination of
the map, that by cutting a canal of about six miles in length the Bay
of Mobile may be connected with that of Pensacola, which must be
accomplished either by the government or the enterprize of indivi-
duals in a short time; a canal connecting these waters would open a
direct communication from Pensacola several hundred miles into the
state of Alabama by the large navigable streams which run into
Mobile Bay—through which the goverment would find a safe and
convenient transportation of troops, munition of war and large quan-
tities of valuable ship timber, live Oak, red and white Cedar Cypress.
&C. East of Pensacola you are aware through St. Rosa sound and
Chactawhachie river there is a safe channel for the same objects for
150 miles into the interior of Florida—
I should be much gratified to be informed of your views of the
extent of the Naval establishment on the coast of Florida, when
located—Congress will be governed in their appropriations for that,

and the Fortifications of the harbour, by your opinion of the impor-
tance and extent of the contemplated establishment and as I shall at
an early period of the session endeavour to get some measure adopted
by which the explorerd points of our coast may befortified and partic-
ularly Pensacola, if it will not be too great an intrusion upon your
valuable time, I should be much pleased to know whether an extensive
Navy Yard is contemplated, which information will enable me to pre-
pare measures accordingly. Give me leave to say Sir, that there is no
point on the whole southern coast where an extensive Naval establish-
ment could be made so advantagiously to the goverment as at Pensa-
cola, and as all the commerce west of the Alligany mountains passes in
that direction and when every point in the northern states is fortified
and protected by the goverment in addition to the shield interposed
by a dense population, that our southern commerce and coast, is
greatly exposed and that we have powerful claims upon a munificent
goverment disposed to protect with equal care every part of its em-
pire.—I would also beg leave to call you attention to the importance
of a survey of the coast of Florida from St Marks to Tampa Bay—I
am informed that no survey of this important part of our coast and
that westward from St Marks. to St Andrews Bay has ever been

Sir, created in me no little concern, inasmuch as I had been repeatedly
informed by Cap" B, that he had the assurances of the q' master
General, that the compensation (1 $ per day) would be paid—In
accordance with the dictates of my own proper interest and of Justice,
I assume the liberty of relating to you, the facts and circumstances
connected with the transaction and also my own sentiments on the
subject—I should not have received the money at all, had it not of
have been for the above mentioned assurances, & for the following
reasons. The nature of the duties of the senior officer on the Road in
question, were I conceived widely different from the ordinary duties
of an Officer on a Mily Road.—Nine months were consumed in open-
ing the Road, as far as the Tooloogie, a stream ten miles east of the
Appalachicola, during the whole of which time, Capt" B. was present,
but a very few days.—I was charged by him, both, with the general
direction, and faithful execution of the Route, and can safely say, that
there was much responsibility incident to the service—it was doubtless
the intention of the Government, that as much satisfaction as possible,
should be diffused, among the people of Florida, in the construction
of this Road, and I flatter myself, that every effort was made on my
part, to realize and confirm that view—I claim no merit in the prem-
ises, but am firmly of the belief, that when accountability of this kind
is involved, a remuneration for services rendered, should follow as a
matter of course—
With the force of these considerations I am peculiarly influenced;
and feel confident that the representation I have made, will meet your
entire concurrence—with this conviction, Sir, I consider myself justi-
fyed, in appealing to your sense of justice, aid and assistance, for a
remission of the decree, which is the origin of this communication" &

HON: HENRY CLAY Secretary of State,
SIR, I deem it of importance to call your particular attention, to
the Wreckers on the Florida Keys, and the evils that have, for a long
time, and yet continue, to distress the Commerce of the United States
on this coast.
The Legislative Council of Florida has endeavoured by law, which
has been approved of by Congress to secure to the owners and under-
writers the property that may be shipwrecked on this coast.” But
42 Not found.
* Under the act of the Legislative Council of July 4, 1823, the salvor or salvors
of wrecked property could report it to a justice of the peace or notary of any
port of the Territory whose duty it was to summon a jury of five persons. This
jury was to investigate the facts of the wreck and salvage and to make an award
(Fla., Acts, 1823, pp. 128-132). This Florida act was annulled by an act of
Congress, approved Feb. 1, 1826, 4 STAT. 138. See also ante, vol. XXII, 814, n.

it is a subject on which I doubt the right of the Territory to Legislate;
and my opinion has been strengthened, by a decission of the Hon:
Judge Lee " of Charlston; and also a decission of the Hon: Joseph L.
Smith of St: Augustine, declaring our Wrecking law Unconstitu-
tional.” I have not had the decissions before me but I do not doubt
they were rendered—You will at once admit that the interest of the
United States is deeply involved when I assure you, that, from the
best information, I feel convinced, that there is annually wrecked on
the Florida Coast, property to the value of $500:000. The numerous
Wreckers on this coast are unlicenced, and much of the property
Wrecked is smuggled by them under the pretence of taking it for
adjudication to different ports. There is also engaged in the fishing
trade, from the Island of Cuba fifty or sixty vessels most of which
belong to that Island. I believe many of them are little better
than Pirates and Smugglers and are hew under the pretence of
fishing, engaged in smuggling and Wrecking to the great injury of Our
Country. I can think of no other remedy for these evils but to ap-
point a Judge to reside on some of the Keys, or at Tampa Bay, who
should have jurisdiction of all such cases, and he should be required to
remain at his post, as the business will occupy him daily. Some mode
of granting licences should be provided by law and the power given to
some Officer of Withdrawing the licence from any Wrecker who shall
act fraudulently or contrary to law—
A port should be designated by law where all Wrecked property
taken on the coast should be carried for adjudication: This would at
once apprise the owners and underwriters at what place they could
attend. At present they are wholly unadvised at which port wrecked
property will be carried as that is left to the Salvors.
The Treasury Department, I know have hitherto appointed all
Officers for our Revenue Cutters. These Officers should be specially
selected for this coast: None but those best qualified and of known
honesty ought to command; for the temptations are too numerous and
strong in this quarter to be resisted by Ordinary Characters. The
utmost attention and vigilence should be exercised over this coast,
or much of the revenue of the United States will be lost. The con-
tiguity of Cuba and other Islands to the Coast of Florida; and the
numerous Keys and Inlets offer to the Smuggler the strongest tempta-

GENERAL. Sometime this year, I was compelled to discharge my
Indian Interpreter, in consequence of his dissipated habits, and have
since, used the Interpreter, employed by the Sub Indian Agent near
this post. The rations, issued to Indians, agreeably to the treaty, at
St Augustine, having ceased, the Indian agency near this, has of
course been broken up. I have therefore directed, the Interpreter to
be employed, giving only $15 pr. month, being less, By $10, than he
rec,d from the Governor of the Territory. From the number of
Indians visiting, and near the post, it is absolutely necessary that we
should have an Interpreter.
I have also employed a Spanish Interpreter, at $15 pr. month, which,
I hope you will approve of. The coast south of this, is inhabited
entirely by persons speaking the Spanish language only. Their de-
tached situation, from the Havannah, and all places on the American
coast, with the exception of this, induces them to look up to us for
protection. They are frequently robb,d by pirates calling themselves,
Columbian vessells of War, and even, if Columbians, they have no
right, to land on our coast, and commit depredations, altheugh ad-
mitting it might be against their enemies. These Spaniards have
been settled, on the Coast for more than thirty years, were at their
present places of habitation, at the exchange of flags, and have re-
mained there since. They have applied to me, to become American
Citizens, but having no authority to receive their oaths of Allegiance
I have applied to Governor Duval, for such power which I have no
doubt, will be given.
With the boats, belonging to the post, I shall make frequent excur-
sions, along the coast, visiting all the Harbors, and inlets, and should
I find any Columbian vessell of War, or pirate or smuggler, they will

be taken, and reported to the Government. There has been one
instance of a brig, having come into the lower part of this Bay, with
a cargo of 150 Africans, & no doubt with the intention of smuggling
them ashore, either to persons in this Territory, or the lower parts of
the State of Georgia. This information, I rec,d from the Indians,
about two months after the brig left the bay, but I could never ascer.
tain correctly, whether any of the negroes were landed. The inter.
preter is an excellent pilot, and would, in that capacity render im.
portant services. I have applied to Genl Scott for permission to make
these excursions, and also informed him, that the Indians, I believe
are in the habit of receiving spirits, and other articles, from the
Havannah which should be stopp,d.
There are some few articles of public property in my possession,
which I have not been able to make a report of, agreeably to the regu.
lations, as the vouchers, rec,d from Capt Burch were lost. I shall
write to him for copies of them, and will forward a return, as soon,
as rec,d.
I have given to Capt Clarke, more than one half of my command
for the road, and, it all times affords me great pleasure to render all
the aid and assistance in my power, to forward these internal improve.

Florida, and beg leave to submit for the consideration of the President,
some objections to the sale of Chipola lands in March.”
I cannot see any reasons deemed forcible or convincing, why the
sales shall not progress in the usual way, of those lands contiguous to
the District which has been sold by the U. S.—There is a district of
Country, as you will observe, from the Georgia line to “Forbes Pur-
chase” between the Oclockney an Apalachicola, on which there are a
number of Settlers equally able to purchase, and more so, than the
Chipola settlers; they have been induced to beleive that the Sales
would progress in that direction, and have made preparations accord-
ingly; the lands are not generally so good as those of Chipola, the
Country much more spotted, and out of the 12 or 14 Townships with
the fractions, and that which was unsold of the Twenty Townships,
which will probably be considered sufficient, a Sale might be ordered.
The U.S. will have as good an opportunity for making a Sale at this
time of those lands, as at any other; much of the land in that Country,
and particularly in the vicinity of Quincy (the County seat of Gads-
den) is of the first quality, as you will perceive by reference to the
return of Surveys.—
The Planters on Chipola encountered many difficulties in forming
their settlements in that quarter, and have exhausted their means of
purchasing, in the improvement of their farms, but have a fair prospect
of being remunerated by the next fall, for the money expended in the
opening and improvement of the Country, from their crops by which
it is hoped they will be enabled to purchase their lands; and it is
certainly the interest as well as the duty of Govern", in a frontier and
exposed Country, to sell out their lands to small settlers where they
can get a fair price, rather than to large Planters who would quarter
the borders of the Union with overseers and negroes. If the sale of
these lands were directed in March, the numerous and respectable
families who are now there, would be driven from their homes and if
there is a good deal of “money ready” for the Chipola lands, it is not
in the hands of the Settlers, but an equal sum may be realized by
them, if the sale is postponed until Fall.—
I think from this and many other considerations, it would be
adviseable to let the Sales progress regularly, that the population
may be increased and strengthened in the centere, about the Seat of
Govern', where those desirous of settling have examined the lands,
where there are no cogent reasons for a departure from established
usage *—

POST OFFICE DEPt. 2d Decr 1825.
HON. JO”. L. WHITE Wash City.
In consequence of the Suggestions rec" from you in the conversation
alluded to in y letter of to day,” a proposition for an add mail from
Tallahassee to the Hartford & Montgomery line, has been despatched
to Mr M*Comb, the Cont', which it is presumed will speedily ac,
complish y” object in that respect. Upon comparing the comp" now
allowed for the weekly mail between Tallahassee & Pensacola, with
that given for the fortnight mail been the former place & S*Augustint
it is found that the Service on the Pensacola route considering the
superior distance is performed on much lower terms than that Or
S” Augustine route, & it is inferred that an augmentation of the ac:
commodation on the S" Augustine route, to the extent you propose
would require a greater expense than can with prudence be appro-
priated to that object. It is hoped that the add accomd" proposed
to be given on the route to G", will satisfy the present demand of the
Citizens you represent, & that until the population & intercourse On
the line from Tallahassee to S*Augustine shall reach a State requiring
& justifying greater expense for its mail accomd", the existing ar.
rangem" will be considered as Sufficient. The Dep" feels every dis.
position to extend its advantages to this interesting Territory to the
utmost extent of the wishes of its inhabitants, but there are restraints

GENTLEMEN. The letter from M. Ward relative to the Sale of the
Chipola lands in the month of March next,” together with a com-
munication from M* White" the Delegate from Florida was sub-
mitted to the President who has directed that the Chipola lands shall
not be proclaimed for sale until the 1* Monday in Decem' next.”
No sale will therefore take place in March. It is possible that a sale
of the Lands in the neighborhood of Quincy together with those
that were heretofore proclaimed but not offered at public sale may be
sold on the 1st Monday of June next, provided such information
may be received previous to the middle of February, as may in the
opinion of the President make it expedient to have such sale. M"
White seems at present to be doubtful of the expediencey of such sale,
but as there will be time to proclaim a Sale to take place in June, at any
time previous to the middle of February, the decision of the question
is suspended for the present, and I will be much obliged to you for
your views in relation to the Sale of these Lands in June, or whether
it would be better to wait until December when a Sale of twenty or
more townships could be had, consisting of the townships adjacent to
Quincy, and those embracing the principal Settlements on the

lative cognizance and at the same time under a firm belief that your
honorable bodies while they carefully advance and anxiously regard
the general and common weal will not hesitate to adopt measures so
pregnant in their results with the interests of the General Government
nor fail to cherish with the same solicitude because of her peculiarly
infantile and dependant situation interests thus resulting to the
Territory itself we deem no other reasons needful to encourage us to
lay before your Honorable bodies our views in relation to these objects.
Your Memorialists on recurring to the several subjects which have
presented themselves for remedy and which have hitherto operated
as evils would beg leave to suggest as the first and probably as para-
mount in importance the subject of the establishment of a Court
having maritime jurisdiction upon the peninsula of Florida for the
more convenient immediate and just adjudication of cases resulting
from the multitude of Wrecks which from the Character of our
Coasts must annually take place. The exreme danger of the navi-
gation from the mouth of the Mississippi River to S' Augustine and
particularly that portion of it from Key West to the latter place is as
a fact so proverbial that it need not be suggested except as in con-
nection with other facts it declares the necessity of Governmental in-
terference to encourage individual enterprise by offering a protection
to the property both of the planters and the merchants as well as to
improve the commercial condition of the Nation by obviating the
difficulties which nature seems to have raised as impediments to its
progress. For when it is recollected that the whole of the produce
of that extensive and agricultural portion of the Union the Western
and South Western States together with a great part of the Com-
merce between the United States and the West Indies must neces-
sarily on its passage to market encounter the dangers of a Coast
composed of Shoals and reefs and for the distance of four hundred
miles uninhabitable the result becomes alike obvious and necessary
that individual distress is constantly accumulating and individual in-
terests both as it regards life and property daily sacrificed the planter
is deprived in an hour of the product of his twelve months labour
the capitolists of the Country become bankrupt and the energies and
enterprise of the Citizen are enervated and destroyed. Thus is sug-
gested the importance to which subject your honorable bodies will
doubtless give due consideration of encouraging the formation of
wrecking Companies and of holding out inducements to the masters
of wrecking Vessels to become active in the preservation of the lives
and property of the unfortunate which your memorialists conceive
can only be effected by the establishment of a proper tribunal upon
the peninsula immediately in the neighborhood of the reef where the
Wreckers may immediately have his salvage adjudged to him as his

recompense.—With these objects in view and presuming upon
confirmation of Congress to give it validity the Legislative Council
the Territory during their Session of the last year established by l
a territorial Court at Key West invested with power to hear and
termine all causes arising upon Wrecks to adjudge his salvage to
Wrecker &" which your memorialists confidently believe has not ol
served the purposes of humanity but has also been extensively :
vantageous to the commerce of the Union and of other Natio
But we regret to say that the United States Courts both of this T
ritory and of the neighboring states have declared the law of
Council creating such Court invalid as contradictory to the laws
the United States * and your memorialists thus driven to the nec
sity of applying to the General Government for relief would hope
be indulged in the suggestion that if in its Wisdom Congress shot
deem it consistent and expedient to delegate to the Legislative Col
cil of this Territory the power of creating and establishing a Co
on the peninsula with the powers and for the purposes before alluc
to as well as of laying such duties upon sales at auction of such pr
erty as may be adjudicated upon and exposed to sale by the order
such Court it would redound at once to the interests of General G.
ernment and of the Territory by securing to the Treasury of
latter a sufficient fund to defray a large proportion of the expel
incident to her Government and from the vicinity of said Court

could we believe so controll and direct its powers that extens
benefit would be the result of its operations.

Your Memorialists recollecting the magnificent policy which the
United States have adopted upon internal improvements beg to remind
Congress of so much of the memorial” of this body at its last session
as relates to the subject of a Canal through the peninsula to connect
the navigable waters of the S" John's River with those of the Suwanee
and to add thereto the idea of a Western continuation of the same to
the Bay of Mobile by removing the obstructions which at present
accidentally occur in the Bayou Manchac a navigable water con-
necting the Mississippi River and Lake Ponchartrain Such a canal
complete and of sufficient width and depth would enable Steam Boats
on the Mississippi River of ordinary tonnage with ease and safety to
visit the Atlantic Sea-board at S* Marys Darien and Savannah in
Georgia and in the City of Charleston*—Your Memorialists cannot
omit to remark on this subject that from the best information which
is within their power all the canalling necessary to connect the various
navigable waters from the S*Marks river at Fort S*Marks to Mobile
Bay would little if any exceed twelve miles where the cutting would
not require more than to be a ditch of sufficient dimension to contain
the column of water required—The distance from S' Marks to the
Suwannee River entirely through a low flat sandy Country exclusive
of any natural assistance which may be afforded by streams in that

* See White to the Secretary of War, Nov. 28, 1825 (NA, WD, CE Lets. Recd.,
W965), proposing the survey for a canal from Waccasassa Bay, below the mouth
of the Suwannee River, to St. Johns River. Such a canal, it was contended,
would facilitate the commerce of the Mississippi Valley and the southern states
with the eastern seaboard and promote settlement and the sale of public lands.
This was answered Nov. 29, 1825 (loc. cit., Lets. Issued Inter. Improvts.), that the
views presented were of high interest, but that an inspection of the proposed
route was not possible with the means and personnel at hand. White's letter
was printed contemporaneously in the Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser,

of the Iberville River to the mouth of the St. Johns River, is printed in Niles'
Register, xxviiI, 95. A memorial of citizens of Camden Co., Ga., referred to
the House Committee on Roads and Canals, Feb. 2, 1824, requested Congressional
support for opening a canal from the waters of the St. Marys River along the
southern edge of the Okefenokee Swamp to the Suwannee River and along that
river through the Territory of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico (H. Doc. 54, 18

where those streams will always furnish fifteen or twenty feet de

there are several lakes which would shorten the distance to be e.
vated eight or ten miles and perhaps more this rout lies over a cour
slightly undulating.—A Canal one hundred feet wide and contair
water ten feet in depth would afford all the facilities which can
desired. It is believed that the whole expense would little if at
exceed two millions of dollars for its complete construction.—Y
memorialists believe that the manifest advantage in the rise of pu
Lands in this Territory and the extensive and prompt facilities in
transportation of war munitions or soldiers which it would furnish
the protection of the Atlantic Sea-board in time of war not to adv
to the incalculable commercial advantages which would result to
those States whose waters are tributary to the Mississippi River ol
the commerce of the world around the Cape of Florida, now and e
precarious would be and are considerations of sufficient magnit
to induce Congress to adopt measures for the completion of
project.—Although Your Memorialists do not abandon the grou
they have already assumed on this subject and although they
confidently of opinion that by opening the proposed Canal as a h
road for the commerce of all parts of the North American Repu
and of the world upon the principles already recognized and ac
upon by Congress in relation to Internal Improvements and ther
to demonstrate the wisdom of the policy established, yet sho
Congress feel disinclined to act upon this subject, your Memorial
would respectfully suggest the propriety of granting to this Gove
ment the Land wherever it is public for half a mile in width on e.
side of said Canal rout where it may be laid down with powers

Your Memorialists convinced that it is the policy of the General
Government as soon as practicable to remove and concentrate West
of the Mississippi River and beyond the verge of the white settle-
ments the different tribes of Indians and likewise convinced that
their entire removal from Florida would redound not only to the
interests of the Territory but also to those of the General Government
by the consequent enhancement of the value of the Public Lands that
will be eventually offerred and exposed to sale and judging from the
peculiar Character of these people that they are and always will be
dissatisfied within any prescribed limits of this Territory and conse-
quently more so when agreably to the arrangement of the General
Government they are left solely to agricultural pursuits for their fu-
ture subsistence and inasmuch as the Creek Indians within the char-
tered limits of the State of Georgia from whom the Seminoles of
Florida are originally descended and between whom there exist as
consanguinity as well as comity of interests are about to be removed
beyond the Mississippi.—Your Memorialists believe that on this oc-
casion they would be more likely to acceed to a proposition for a re-
moval than under any other circumstances—Your Memorialists would
therefore venture to recommend that a Treaty be held with them for
the purpose of effecting so desirable an object. And in connection
with this subject your Memorialists would beg leave to represent the
defenceless condition of this section of the Territory as well as the
uncertainty of the duration of any amicable arrangement that may
have been or shall be made with these savage neighbors and as a
consequent to request from the General Government one thousand
stand of arms to be deposited in the City of Tallahassee for the use
and defence of the Territory of Florida.
Your Memorialists in compliance with the expression of the public
wish of a part of this Territory solicit if it should comport with the
views of the General Government the delegation to the Legislative
Council of a discretionary power to enable the people of this Territory
by law to elect their County officers.”—Your Memorialists would
farther suggest that for the purpose of encouraging settlements in
this Territory as well as in justice to those individuals who have
already settled upon and improved public Lands a law establishing
and regulating pre-emption rights would operate to the advantage of
the people without injustice or injury to the Government.
* On motion of Del. White, the House passed a resolution on Dec. 16, 1825
(House Journal, 19 Cong., 1 sess., p. 64), “That the Committee on the Territories
be instructed to inquire what amendments are necessary in the civil administra-
tion of the Government of the Territory of Florida, and what alterations ought
to be made in the laws organizing a Territorial Government.”

GOVERNOR DUVAL TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:LS"]
Middle Florida TALLAHASSEE December 12th 1825.
HON: JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War
To Co'M'Kenney who is charged, with the Indian Affairs in your
department I have written a particular account of the State of the
Indian Affairs in this Territory." The responsibility which the
Agent Co" Humphreys has thrown upon me by not conforming to my
instructions, Copies of which have been transmitted to Co"M"Kenney
has not only Surprised but has Seriously deranged my whole plan for
the Government of the Indians in this quarter. I am not informed
by the Agent why my instructions were not pursued, or why the
Indians were not brought within their limits, altho they went to the
borders. I am convinced a military force is necessary to bring these
people to order and obedience, and I have recommended the establish-
ment of a post on the South frontier of Allachua.” My personal
influence will very much contribute to effect any order which your
Department may require to be executed.
Permit me to Suggest that if Congress Should mak any arrange-
ment with the Creek Nation So as to remove them entirely, The
Siminole Indians would be willing to go with them, and that a Treaty
might be made with the Florida Indians highly advantageous to the
United States. Should Such a measure be authorised by the Govern-
ment, I cannot too Strongly urge the appointment of Co' James
Gadsden as one of the Commissioners, he is not only personally
acquainted with all the Chiefs but understands the Indian Character
perfectly. The Indians on the Appalachicola whose lands were
reserved to them by the late Treaty would no doubt be willing also
to emigrate *

p 92 See DuVal to the Secretary of War, Dec. 16, 1825 (NA, OIA, loc. cit., printed,
A. S. P., op. cit.), informing him that 300 Indians have returned from lands assigned
them and have crossed the Suwannee, stealing cattle and corn from settlers who
are about to take up arms. But, he suggested, the Indians were evidently starv-
ing. Since the Indian agent had lost his influence, force has become necessary,
and that the treaty could be enforced with 200 regular troops. He urges the
establishment of a military post on the southern frontier of Alachua.
* No reply found. On Dec. 28, 1825, a petition by Reuben Charles was pre-
sented to the House by Del. White (House Journal, 19 Cong., 1 sess., p. 99) stating
that he had established a ferry on the Suwannee River at great expense and
had suffered depredations by the Indians, and praying for the grant of a small
tract on each side of the river. The text of the petition has not been found.

fact is that for near 3 years I did discharge the whole duties of S

HONLE SAMUEL L SOUTHWARD Secretary of the Navy
I had the honor last winter while at Washington to address you
on the subject of the depredations made in Florida on the ship Timber
near the Gulf stream and the rivers running into it,
The country from the mouth of the Occilla river has been surveyed
as far on towards Pensacola as the Choctahatchee river—The Bays
of St. Andrews, St. Joseph and Appalachicola, presents altogether the
best timber for ship building in the United States—but the Govern-
ment may be assured that to preserve it. a special agent should be
immediately appointed with power to examine and select such sections
and fractions as in his judgement should be reserved for use of the
Navy—and report the same to the Government. The agent. should
be orderd to superintend and preserve, unmolested the lands so
reserved from intruders of evey discription—I hazzard nothing in
saying that the imployment of an agent for this object, would be
great economy and would save even at this time thousands of dollars
worth of the most valuable ship timber annually to the United
States,—I would earnestly recommend as the agent to be appointed
M Charles Haire a resident of Tallahassee a man of information good
judgement strict honor, and persevering activity I believe this gentle-
man is personally know to you, and if he is he will not need any
recommendation-
The country on the St. Josephs and St Andrews Bay is settling fast.
none of the lands in that quarter have yet been sold but it is expected
the sale will be ordered next spring, It should be posponed in my
opinion untill the reservations are made for the Government.

The peculiar Situation of Florida with twelve hundred Miles of Sea
Coast demands of the Executive, constant attention, to the various

do not know, whither the Governors of other Territorys keep a record
of their proceedings, and of their correspondence with the Several
Departments of the General Government, as well as a Seperate record
of local business transacted in the Executive Office; Such however
has ever been my practice, and its value and importance will (without
detail on my part) be obvious to a Statesman—From the accumulation
of business, I cannot continue the course hitherto pursued, unless
some provision is made for a Clerk.—
I have seriously impaired my vision by constant writing of Nights,
which I have been in the habit of doing even in Summer frequently
until midnight. Since my return to Florida I can say truly that
my business has become so pressing that for four weeks past, I have
been confined to my Office till twelve at Night and frequently until
two in the morning. It is impossible to stand this long, and I assure
you Sir, the business of the Office must be neglected unless I am per-

addressed my communication to Col White the delegate from Florida,
making known to him the object of my visit and the character of my
charges"—
Since I have had the honour of being an officer of the government
it has been my wish to claim no distinction or preference other than
that I could claim as a citizen but now I am compelled to appeal to
you for that which as a citizen I would not ask, viz that you will
direct an enquiry by persons selected by you into my official con-
duct, which deeply and necessarily involves my private reputation
and honour—Judge Smiths personal feelings towards me, preclude
me from anything like a fair and impartial hearing before him, in
this assertion I am warranted by his long and repeated and aggre-
vated conduct towards me both as an officer of his court and as an
individual, and my defence when fairly made will go so far much to
implicate him with having used undue and improper means to in-
culpate me that it could not be urged on a court where he presided,
without subjecting me to the indignation and anger of the court,
which he would constitute "—

a letter to you from J. Belloure,” complaining of depredations
his property by a party of the emigrant Indians; also, certain (
of letters and instructions to the agent Colonel Humphreys
which have been submitted to the Secretary of War.
I am directed by the Secretary in reply, to state, that he
received from the late Acting Governor Walton, certain commu
tions relating to the issuing of rations &c, * and a copy of one
Charles Pindar to Col”, Walton,” the complexion of which,
altogether, was not satisfactory. No reply has been made to
Walton. It was delayed in the expectation that something fu
might happen in regard to these communications, or at least tha
aid extended to the Indians on the representations which had
made of their starving condition, might produce quiet, and a sta
permanent harmony—when the intimations conveyed in that (
spondence implicating some of the parties, would have forme
subject of a Special enquiry.
The points of difficulty appear to be two: First—The locati
the Indians by the Agent, upon lands (called the Big Swamp
included in the extension of the Northern boundary. Second-
over issue of Rations, by the agent, in violation of positive ins
tions.”—In regard to the first, the Secretary of War directs how
exceptionable he esteems the location, under all the circumst:
of the case to be, that the Indians be permitted to occupy bot
Big Swamp and the Big Hammock—The Big Hammock of right
by virtue of a formal and legal extension of the Northern and We
line; the other by Courtesy—and for the time being, subject t
future directions of the President. You will explain this to
fully; and give them the option to accept of this right of temp

assigned to them; or, if they would prefer it, to lands which the Gov-
ernment is willing to assign them West of the Mississippi.
The subject of your recommendation for the establishment of a
Military post on the South Frontier, of Allachua will be considered,
by the Secretary.
The Secretary directs, that, you proceed with the examination of
the complaints in regard to the rations. This subject having been
entrusted to you under instructions, from the Department, no one
it is presumed can so well determine upon the abuse, which is implied
in the several communications before me, or a violation of your
instructions by the Agent.
The Secretary of War directs that you make a thorough examina-
tion into every branch of the subject connected with the procuring
and issuing of the rations, and especially into that referr'd to, by
Col° Walton, on M* Pindar's letter to him, and report the same with
your own opinions, to the Department.
You will order the Sub-agent to such point on the Appalachicola,
as you may esteem to be best.
The answers to your queries are these—first—If, in the examination,
now ordered, you shall find the delivery of rations by M Chaires was
indispensable; to the Indians; and that they could not have been
sustained without them; you will pay for them. Second—The excess
is to be allow'd on the same principle. Third—All the accounts of
the Agent are to be submitted to your examination, on which you
will make such decisions as well in regard to the vouchers, as to other
things, as you may esteem it proper to make, to be submitted to the
Department for its final determination.
It will be proper to ascertain the loss complained of by M. Belloure
and report it to the Department with your own opinion of its fairness.
The Indians under the act of 1802,” will be held responsible for such
acts, and so you will inform them.
Your views in regard to the mode of paying the Indians their
annuities are in strict accordance with my own.” There can be no
doubt of the evils which result to these unfortunate people, from the
application, by themselves, of their annuities; nor that the amount
goes directly to the venders of Spirituous liquors who beset the
annuity grounds.—Annuities are a curse to the Indians, rather than
a blessing, unless their application be made for them. Humanity
requires that you take measures to obtain their consent to allow the

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF JACKSON
AND WALTON COUNTIES
[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred December 27, 1825]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled.
The memorial of the undersigned Citizens of the Counties of
Jackson and Walton in the Territory of Florida respectfully represents,
That your memorialists attached to this country by the fertile
character of its Soil and the Commercial advantages which it seemed
to promise from its proximity to the Bay and harbour of Saint
Andrews, have withdrawn from the States in which they formerly
resided all their property with the view and intention of making a
permanent settlement here—some of your memorialists have resided
here several Years and all of them have lived in the Country a sufficient
length of time to grow something for market, and if the prospects
which its natural advantages afford should be realized they will never
regret their removal hither; although, in doing so, they have had to
exchange the comforts and pleasures of society and comparative ease,
for the labour and privat [MS. torn] necessarily incident to a new
settlement, entirely remote from population and civilized Life.—In
regard to the first inducement, your memorialists are happy to state
that they have not been deceived, there is no Country perhaps of
simmilar extent in which the principle articles of export from the
southern States can be raised with more facility and in greater abun-
dance, but your memorialists have not as yet, been so fortunate in
their expectations of commercial advantages—it is true they had
anticipated inconveniences of this sort in their early settlements, but
they had indulged the belief that as soon as they had prepared for
Market produce to a sufficient extent to make it an object for com-
mercial enterprize, those difficulties would subside; having almost at
their doors one of the finest Harbours in the southern Country they
believed that no obstacle would be presented to an easy transportation
of every surplus article which their industry and economy would
produce, and that in return for such products they would receive
through the same easy Channel the Comforts and neessaries of Life—
In this however, they have in some degree been disappointed. and
this disappointment has resulted entirely from want of a Port of
Entry at Saint Andrews.—So long as your memorialists are compelled
to trade in little coasting vessels to the small Villages on the Sea-board,
in which Ports of Entry have been established, so long will the profits
of their labour be reduced, and so long will the prices of the articles
which their comfortncessarily compells them to import be advanced—

When your memorialists take into view the beautiful and heal
situation of the Bay of Saint Andrews and the almost entire abse
of everything like obstruction to its easy entrance, (there being a w
channel of 18 feet water over its bar)—when they regard the peri
security which its Harbour affords to vessels of every description :
when they cast an Eye over the numerous bodies of fertile Land:
situated as to point to it as the natural Outlet for all their produ
they can but think that it is destined at some not very remote per
to be a place of much commercial importance and enterprize,
your memorialists confidently believe that the moment foreign :
other Wessels are permited to enter directly into the Bay without
necessity of going one or two hundred miles beyond their destinati
for the purpose of entering at some Custom-house, will be the da
of that importance.—
Your memorialists therefore humbly pray that your honora
Body would take this matter into early consideration, and if it sho
not be considered inconsistent with the interest of the Governme
that a Port of Entry may be established at the Bay of Saint Andr
as soon as it may be deemed practicable—and your memorialists
ever pray &c—

of the U States, and deeply impressed with the importance of openi
new channels of intercourse between the extremities and sections
the surest means of developing the resources and strengthening t
bonds of the union, it would be unnecessary to enumerate in det
all the benefits to be expected from the accomplishment of a wo
partaking in its character more of national than local interest.
While the American commerce, but particularly the coasting tra
between the East and the West, will be relieved from a heavy tribu
annually exacted in the form of shipwrecks and insurance; while t
dangerous shoals of the Florida Keys will be avoided, and the distar
from the Atlantic ports to the mouths of the Missippi greatly reduc.
the increased facilities to certain and rapid communications along
exposed frontier adding to the national security by augmenting t
means of national defence will be a result the no less imposing—T
Undersigned therefore in forwarding the views of the Legislat
Council of Florida on a subject of such general interest, do m
respectfully solicit of Your honorable body the necessary orders a
appropriations for an immediate exploration of the country under t
direction of skilful Engineers with a view of ascertaining the ma
direct practicable route for the canal contemplated, as well as t
probably cost of its construction—Its practicability being establish
the expense of its execution, it is believed, will be found to bear
proportion to the benefits of which the whole Union may partake, a
these considerations in favor of a great National canal, embarrassed
its execution by no constitutional impediments, encourage the ho
that the General Government will undertake the operation as a wo
appropriately its own—If however different views of this subj
should control a decision of your honorable body adverse to t
desirable result; the preliminary facts of practicability and cost bei
ascertained by a corps of Scientific Engineers deservedly enjoyi
the confidence of the whole community, supported by the furth
countenance of the General Government in the form of a proportion
pecuniary contribution to a joint stock company, it is believed
your Memorialist would operate as powerful inducements to priva
Individuals to embark their capitals in the accomplishment of t
undertaking—It is therefore most earnestly solicited of your honorab
body; that whether as a national work to be constructed exclusive
with the public funds for general benefit, or as a work to be unde
taken by private enterprise under a charter of incorporation with f
powers for saidpurpose; you will early adopt such preliminary measur
and extend such assistance as in your wisdom may be deemed nec.

WILLIAM H. SIMMONS TO WILLIAM DRAYTON
[NA:HF, 21 Cong., 1 sess.: C *]
SAINT AUGUSTINE 10th January 1826.
DEAR Sir, Having observed that you are a member of the Judiciary
Committee, I take the liberty of submitting to you a few facts relating
to the case of Judge Smith of this Territory, who has been arraigned
before Congress upon certain charges which will probably be examined
into in the course of the present session. The local Legislature here,
has from time to time, by its enactments, imposed multiplied and
troublesome duties upon the Judges of the Superior Courts, for which
extra labour however, some compensation appears to have been
provided in the Act relating to the salaries and fees of the different
public officers of the Territory. The most eminent Lawyers here,
have concurred in so construing the Act in question; and the Judge
was first solicited by them to receive fees for the various services,
which under the Territorial Laws, he was frequently called upon to
perform; so that if he has committed an error in doing this, he has in
fact been led into it by the advice and opinion of the leading members
of his own Court.
There was none better qualified either by abilities or learning,
rightly to interpret the Law referred to than the Judge himself, and
he did not proceed to collect the fees in question, until he had satisfied
himself that he was legally entitled to receive them. As many of the
services required of him under the Territorial Laws, are compensated
by fees; when performed by the Justices of the peace, the result would
have been, had he undertaken to give his Labour, in such cases, gratis,
that the business of a magistrate would have been thrown upon his
hands in addition to his other functions; for parties would not only
have prefferred applying to the quarter where no expense was to
be incurred, but would also for the same reason have multiplied the
calls upon him. I am aware that the Act of taking the fees would not
be sufficiently Justified by these reasons, and could only be sanctioned
by the authority of Law; This authority seems to be given with suffi-
cient explicitness in the Law referred to. Genl Call, however, and
M" Macon, the District Attorney, who it is not to be concealed, have
long manifested a decided personal hostility towards the Judge, have
been loud and violent in accusing him of corruption in Office, and
of having extorted fees from persons doing business before him, which
he was not by Law entitled to demand. The case appears to be one
of mere difference of opinion. The ambiguities and contradictions
which have characterised the Enactments of the Legislative Council
has been a subject of general complaint and the present case has

partly arisen from this careless Legislation; for we find two pa
thus widely differing in their interpretation of the same Law, a
also partly the result of private animosity and pique.
That the salary of the Judges of the Territory is very inadeq
is generally admitted. As Judge Smith has a large family to sup
I sincerely hope that his compensation will be increased by Cong
I have been induced to trouble you with this exposition, in the
that should his case come before you, the facts above detailed n
assist you in forming a correct opinion upon it, and also with a
of tendering my humble testimony in favor of an able and merito
public Officer, whose conduct has been constantly under my obse
tion and has as constantly elicited my approbation.
Judge Smith has given general satisfaction by his conduct on
Bench and has but few enemies in the Territory; these, however
violent and implacable and are not without influence, and
determined to leave no effort untried to hurl him from his O.
The people here are greatly interested for him, and have forwa
petitions and representations in his favor which doubtless by
time have reached Congress.”

intrude upon your valuable time, but subscribe myself with g
respect and esteem Your Obedt. Servt.

late Secretary, as conveyed to you in his letter of 20"April 1824, "
cannot be, at this time reversed—But such aid as the Secretary feels
himself justified in granting to you, he will cheerfully extend. He has
directed me to prepare a Commission for Major John Phagan, as
Sub-agent, and to direct him to report himself to you. You will
consider him as attached to your Superintendency, and his services,
as being at your command in what ever branch of it you may have
need of them to aid you in the execution of your duties. You will be
allowed also, at the rate of one hundred Dollars per annum for Office
rent and Stationary—this sum you will add in your returns as a
contingent item which will be acted on with your quarterly accounts.
You will be held accountable for all monies which you may receive
on account of your Superintendency, as a matter of course—no special
compensation can be allowed for either the “risque or trouble”—This
is understood to be embraced in your pay as Superintendent.
It is hoped the relief which the services of the Sub-Agent, may
afford you, and the allowance for office rent and Stationary may
make the duties of your Superintendency lighter and more acceptable.
You will pay Maj Phagan at the rate of five hundred Dollars per
annum."—

+t I strongly advise that the Florida Indians be encourged to sell

Indians have not acted properly—the negroes have unbounded
influence over them and are much more hostile to the white people
than their masters—The Indians exercise no controle over their
slaves, and they derive no advantage from their labour One Chief who
has 70 slaves has not raised corn to feed his own family These negroes
trade in whisky which they slyly introduce among the Indians and
sell at one dollar a quart Should the indians emigrate the Government
ought not to admit negros to go with them, Much mischief will arrise
to the United States if their slaves should accompany them, if large
bodes of Indians should be thrown together I have never premitted in
a single instance any white man to purchase a negro of an Indian.
but I am convinced the sooner they dispose of them the better—

whom their authenticity has been recognized, and they beg to refer
to the report of the said Land Commissioners in this behalf"—
That the regularity and genuineness of the said documents having
been admitted by the said report, no question remained, as to the
validity of the title of your Memorialists, except that which arose
from the doubts entertained by the commissioners, as to the powers
of Spanish Governors; doubts which they were incapable of solving,
from the want of access to the Spanish laws.—
That it is with the view of removing these doubts, and of placing
their claim on the clear and unquestionable footing on which they think
it is entitled to stand, that your Memorialists beg leave to submit
herewith “the laws of Spain in relation to disposing of Government
lands” in an authorized translation from the Department of State;
by a reference to which your Memorialists submit it will appear that
“the exclusive power to grant, sell and compromise for the public
lands” was in 1754 deputed from the King,” and for the declared
object of “sparing his subjects the expense and inconvenience of ap-
plying for lands to his Royal person” and in which it is provided
that the “power of appointing subdelegate Judges, to sell and com-
promise for the lands and uncultivated parts of the said dominions
shall belong exclusively to the Vice-roys and Presidents”; and that
“those whom the said Vice-roys and Prisidents shall hereafter appoint,
may subdelegate their commissions to others, for the distant parts
and Provinces of their stations” and that “in the distant parts where
the sea intervenes confirmations shall be issued by their Governors;”
and again, in the year 1786, that it was decreed that “the Indendants
shall be the exclusive Judges of the causes and questions that may
arise in the District of their Provinces, about the sale composition
and grant of Royal lands &c” * all of which absolute powers, and
independently of the King, to make grants, sales and compromises
of the public lands, and to decide all questions thereon, Your Memo-
rialists submit were vested in the Vice roys and Presidents, and their
subdelegates, and also in the Governors and Intendants, as will more

fully and at large appear by a reference to the said Spanish Code
submitted herewith—
And your Memorialists further submit that the said commissioners
in their report allege, that in so far as the title to the said lands is
dependent upon a conveyance from the Indians that they (the
Indians) were incompetent to make a conveyance, to be held and
possessed in full right and entire property. And such is the beleif
of your memorialists, for according to the doctrines maintained by
the Supreme Court the Sovreign, and not the Indians is competent
to authorize a “complete ultimate” title. That the Indians however
had in this case rights which were susceptible of conveyance your
Memorialists submit was acknowledged by the King; for in the treaty
between Spain and the Seminoles made at Pensacola in 1784 (State
papers vol. 10) * it is declared that “his Catholic Majesty does not
exact from the nations of Indians, any lands to form establishments
to the prejudice of the rights of those who enjoy them” but “we
promise in his royal name the Security and Guaranty of those which
they actually hold according to the right of property with which they
possess them.” In regard to the exact interest here guaranteed by
Spain to the Indians your Memorialists submit that it is not essential,
and it would be difficult to define it in phraseology borrowed from
civilised Jurisprudence; but your Memorialists submit that all the
rights incident to possession and enjoyment thus guaranteed to be
held by the Seminole Indians, were fully and entirely conveyed by
them to the said Forbes and Co.—
Your Memorialists further shew that anterior to the conveyances
to Forbes & Co, the said lands were held by a tenure jointly between
Spain and the Indians; and that if a conveyance of either without the
concurrence of the other would have been held to be invalid for the
establishment of a fee simple title; still it will be found that the
conveyances to Forbes & Co. were made in exact accordance with this
joint tenure. The Indians for a good consideration, and with the
formal approbation of the Spanish Government, conveyed all the
right which they on their part held; and the Spanish Government on
its part, not only formally confirmed the Indian title conveyance thus
made, but for a good consideration, set forth in the deed; “imparted
full and direct dominion, so that the said house might as its property
enjoy, possess, sell and alienate; provided “the land be not disposed
of without the knowledge or consent of Government”.
That the time occupied in the transactions which resulted in the
said deeds of conveyance, was a period of Seven years ending in 1811;
from which period, the titles to the lands in question, continued subject

to the condition set forth “that the lands should not be disposed of
without the knowledge or consent of Government” until 13* Oct"
1817 when the Captain General (Cienfuegos) on the petition of Forbes
decreed “a permission for the alienation of the lands” the said officer
having full authority and jurisdiction for this purpose; all which will
appear by reference to the said report—
And your Memorialists further shew, that with an implicit reliance
on the good faith with which the said transactions were conducted,
and which resulted in a title held inviolate by the Spanish Govern-
ment and Indians, for a period of Fifteen years preceding the cession
of Florida to the United States, your Memorialists became the pur-
chasers of the said lands. That they have sustained great and ir-
reparable losses in consequence of the stain, which as they respectfully
conceive, is thus improperly cast upon their title; and that these
inconveniencies are not confined to your memorialists alone; the
lands being on a frontier situation on the Gulf of Mexico, population
is necessarily retarded, and a check is thereby given to the rising
energies of Florida
Your Memorialists therefore ask from Congress such releif, as in
their wisdom they shall think proper to grant *—

DEAR SIR Permit me to invite your attention to the necessity
of a mail route direct from this place to Pensacola. The trade and
intercourse between this Ala County and Pensacola, are daily in-
creasing, and require that a mail route should be established between
the two places. the distance to Pensacola is something like seventy
or eighty miles, yet it is nearly three weeks before a letter mailed at
Pensacola will reach this place. This is an inconvenience that ought
to be remedied, & can be remedied without any expense to the govern-
ment. The revenue arising ea from the postage of letters by the
establishment of this route, would be amply sufficient to defray such
expenses as may be incured by the transportation of the mail
along it.”
I have thought it necessary to make these suggestions, that the
subject may receive such attention as it deserves.

the Secretary of war to the proceedings reported by the commissioners
to his Predecessor, which were truly recorded by their Secretary, at
the Treaty held with the Florida Indians on the 18" of September
1823.” The whole of our proceedings were public, and many gentle-
men were present at every conferrence we held with the Indians.
The Indians never have complained that any improper means
were resorted to, by the commissioners: But it is well known that
many of our citizens, (some of high standing) complained loudly at
the time, and since, that the commissioners had been more liberal
to the Indians, than to their Country— and I am greatly mistaken
if you do not find such complaints filed in your Office—More than
two years have past away since the Treaty was concluded and the
detailed report of the commissioners transmitted to the war Depart-
ment (of which I retained no copy) and now they are called upon to
make answer to general charges of the most serious character, and
that too without delay and upon the information of some unknown,
long delay,d volunteer gardian, of Indian rights. I must be permitted
to say that it is at least uncommon, to arrain the veriest criminal,
without specifying, the charge, and the name of his prosecutor.
Whenever I am furnished with the information received at the
Department with a specification of the alledged “improper means
resorted to’’ and the name of the informant, I will freely state the
course pursued individually by me, in the conduct of the Treaty,
without the fear of censure or the hope of applause”

SIR Your letters of 12* Nov" last * directed to me and One of the

and Acting Gov' of Florida, I have now the honor to answer, your
first, is in answer to a letter of Col° Humphreys the Agent accom-
panied with a plan of the ground and an estimate for a building and
Council House at the Agency. I have instructed the Agent for these
purposes not to exceed Two thousand dollars.
Your letter of the 7" which authorises Co." Walton to draw bills
from time to time on the Secretary of War for a Sum not to exceed
five thousand dollars, will be attended to.
I assure you that no extension of the Indian boundary will keep
them from starving until their next crops come in—The Apalachacola
Indians are in a deplorable State.—Three times last year were their
Corn fields and fences Swept by the uncommon rise of the river—
All these Indians live on the river, and until now they have never
Solicited the aid of the Government for provisions.
The old Chief Blunt and Tuski Harjo have just left me; they have
given me a gloomy picture of the distress now prevailing for want of
food. These Chiefs and their warriors Served with Gen' Jackson
during the Seminole war.
In order to prevent the Indians from Starving, the Strictest economy
must be pursued; and to do this, Corn and Salt, only will be purchased
for them, unless the Department should authorise some Pork and
beef now and then to be distributed—Small portions of either would
be a blessing to these poor, improvident people.
The Indians have continued to fall back on the Settlements, and
have lately acted violently in Alachua by driving a family from their
farm, and taking all the provisions, and distroying part of their houses.
I must still say that a Military Post ought to be established on the
South frontier of Alachua.”
I hope by my presence among the Indians to Settle for the present
the causes of difference that exists between them and the Citizens
of Alachua

I consider a Military Post in that quarter as essential to the protec-
tion of the Indians, as of the Citizens, it would check in the bud any
improper design formed by either party.
The rations which were received by the Agent at Tampa Bay, were
not all issued to the Indians; but as they have been received and must
be lost to the Government unless they are disposed of, I have directed
Co' Humphreys to issue them to the Emigrant Indians in the most
economical manner to subsist them.”
These rations are the same Co' Walton mentioned in his letter of
the 18" of November last to you, as having accumulated at Tampa
Bay &" "
I am not informed whether Co' Walton drew on your Department
for the two thousand dollars which he was authorised to expend in
Supplying the Indians with provisions—and if he did not draw for
that sum, whether I am to consider the two thousand dollars as form-
ing any part of the five thousand dollars specified in your letter of
the 7" of December last.
A very small amount of Actual Cash has been turned over to me
by the late Acting Gov". I am therefore without funds to meet
many Accounts that have been presented.
Col Walton will, in the course of six or eight weeks be in Washington
in order to Settle his Accounts—He has started from this place to
Key West on business of the Territory, and will proceed from thence
to the City.
The complaints that have been made to me by the Citizens of this
Territory on account of alledged losses in Cattle and other property
taken and destroyed, by the Indians, have determined me to attend
and take legal proof of these losses, and to Submit them to the War
Department. -
I do believe that many who complain loudly have Sustained no
loss, and that the Actual loss will be trifling—by taking this step all
clamour against the Indians will be Silenced, and I hope the Secre-
tary of War will approve of the measure, no evil, and much good may
result from this proceeding—Those who have just claims for indem-
nity will be heard in a formal manner, and all who Complain will
have a fair Opportunity of proving the injury they have Sustained-
If the Secretary should however think differently on this Subject I
hope you will advise me as early as possible.
* Another letter from DuVal to McKenney, Mar. 15, 1826, enclosed a deposi-
tion by S. Y. Garey, the issuing agent on the St. Johns River, and Oren Marsh,
showing that the whole number of rations claimed by the emigrant Indians had
never been issued to them (loc. cit.).

greater quantity of surveying than he can personally attend to, and
execute, within the year.

Kentucky District. And as it has been doubted, and if we are cor-
rectly informed, decided by the superior Courts of Florida, that they
have no jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime causes—it has been
thought advisable to define, distinctly, the nature and extent of their
jurisdiction.
In the petition of Waters Smith & J. M. Hanson,” two of the
Marshals of Florida, it is represented, that the Legislative Council,
in December last, passed a law requiring that “all business confided
to the marshals of the Teritory shall be transfered to the sheriffs of
the respective Counties, in which the business belongs”—By “An Act
to amend an act entitled “an act to amend an act for the establish-
ment of a Teritorial government in Florida, and for other purposes”—
approved May 26* 1824—it is provided that the marshals shall also
“be subject to such regulations & penalties, as the legislative council
shall impose, while acting under, and in virtue of, the teritorial
laws”"—and It is not perceived what authority the legislative
council had to transfer from the Marshals to other officers, any por-
tion of their ministerial duties—and more especially as the marshals
and the court are appointed [MS. illegible]" by the United States,
and derive their authority from them. To prevent all further doubt
and difficulty, your committee have thought it advisable to make
these marshals the only ministerial officers of the Superior Courts
and of the Court of appeals within the counties in which they reside.
The Inhabitants of S* Johns County in Florida, whose petition ”
has been refered to the committee, among other things pray to be
allowed the privilege of electing their Legislative Council. Altho' it
has never been the practice to allow this privilege to the citizens of a
Teritory, so long as the U. States paid the members of the Legislative
Council, yet your committee are clearly of the opinion, that it should
now be extended to the inhabitants of Florida. Your committee are
aware of no sufficient reason why they should be denied the right of
electing their own law makers. They are citizens of the U. States.
They look to be admitted into the Union—and it can surely be no
detriment to accustom them, at an early period, to the various duties
& responsibilities of self government.
Your committee have not deemed it necessary to state more largely
the reasons which have induced them to submit the following Bill to
the consideration of the House.

SIR I have the honour herewith to enclose a transcript of the
Register of receipts issued to purchasers of public land during the
month of December 1825, together with a duplicate of my account
current with the United States for the same period.”
Owing to my ill health, and my necessary absence in going to Mobile
for the purpose of depositing the public money in my possession I am
yet unable to forward for your inspection a transcript from the Books
of my Office, embrasing the transactions ef Bay Q#ee during the

by the next mail.

November 1825, was not deposited in Bank. This has been owing to
the instructions given by you to the Surveyor General under date of
the 16" of April 1825.” by which he is advised to draw in favor of the
Receiver of public money at Tallahassee for the amount of his salary
and Clerk hire. Having been informed that such a draft would be
drawn, and the return of the Surveyor General from Tennessee (who
was then daily expected) and not knowing the amount for which the
draft would be given, I retained in my hands the probable amount
which would be required by that Department, which now appears to
be a much larger sum than that required. The Surveyor Genl having
drawn on the Treasury Department previously to his arrival at this
place, he has found it necessary to draw on me for only one thousand
dollars. I hope this explanation will be satisfactory to the Depart-
ment.
I was under the necessity of employing a gentleman to accompany
me to Mobile for the purpose of making my deposit. My expences on
this journey exceed $200. I have not given myself credit for this
expenditure, but submit the question to you whether it is not a proper
charge on the Treasury Department. If it is not, the profits of my
office will not defray the expences I shall be compelled to incur.
The distance from this place to Mobile is about three hundred and
sixty miles. The route passes through a country in many parts
unsettled, and affording no conveniences or facilities in travelling.
Hence it will be imprudent in the Receiver to risk the public money
on this journey without being accompanied by one or more persons,
who cannot be procured without compensation.”

DELEGATE WHITE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:LS]
WASHINGTON January 31st 1826
SIR. The repeated complaints which I have received from Florida,
in regard to the depredations of the Indians, as well as the obligations
imposed by humanity, have induced me to address you on the subject
of their condition at this time. The letters from the Governor” and
the petition from the inhabitants of Alachua” which I had the honour
to transmit to your department, some days since, would give you
some adequate idea of their situation, and demonstrate the necessity
of some immediate measures, for the protection of the agricultural
interests of the Territory. Without repeating, therefore, the diffi-
culties and troubles referred to, or dwelling on unpleasant details, I
shall endeavour to present some suggestions in relation to them,
which might perhaps have some influence with the Government, in
the adoption of a plan for their immediate removal.
Since the Treaty of 1784,” the Florida Indians, as a Nation, have
not been considered by the Spanish Government, as entitled to any
portion of the lands; except such as were occupied by their farms and
villages, and in that only an usufructuary interest, subject to the
paramount title of the Spanish Monarchy. Although there is some
obscurity in the phraseology of that Treaty, such has been the con-
struction by the Spanish Authorities, notwithstanding they have
allowed the Indians in some instances to sell a part of their lands, such
sales are believed to have been of their possessions, requiring the
concurrence and approbation of that Government, to complete the
title. Spain by the Treaty of 1819 conveyed the Floridas in full
property and absolute dominion, to the United States, without any
recognition of an Indian title, and under this treaty the United States
are invested with full authority to make such disposition of them, as
they might think proper, without being restrained by any other con-
siderations, than those which humanity and policy might prescribe,
and without consulting their wishes or caprices on the subject. You
will perceive also, by a reference to the correspondence of General
Jackson in 1821, with the War Department; that he gives it as his
unqualified opinion that the Exceutive ought to remove the Indians
from Florida. And although the Government preferred to treat with
them in 1823, the right to control them is notwithstanding unim-
paired.

they get four millions of acres of land, certain reserves in the middle
of the Territory, supplies for one year, a hundred thousand dollars in
annuities, besides the expenses of the treaty and its execution. The
Northern boundary line is undefined and left in a situation to engender
the most unpleasant difficulties.
By a statement which accompanied the Treaty, there were to be
placed on the reservations 214, and unless I have been greatly mis-
informed, there are about one thousand remaining in the vicinity of
the largest settlements in Florida; and where they must be reduced
in a short time to the painful alternative, of submitting to starvation,
or of supporting existence by plundering their neighbours, like their
unfortunate brethren, who have attempted a residence in that portion
of the Country assigned them.
From the documents forwarded to your Department,” it appears
that the Indians contend for an extension of their boundary line, but
by what rule, it may be asked, are their limits to be determined? If
they were disciplined in agricultural pursuits, a definite and small
portion of land might be adequate to their wants; but considering
their habits and mode of cultivation, it would be difficult to assign a
satisfactory limit, in fulfilling the treaty.
They have abandoned their lands, and are now subsisting on the
bounty of Government; and by depredations on the property of the
Inhabitants; from Saint Johns to Apalachicola, the pasturages are
beset, and the plantations also, and no enclosure is exempted from
the intrusion of these rovers, whose habits alike unfit them for assimi-
lation with the whites, or for subsisting within the limited confines
of this narrow Peninsula.
To releive the Territory from these incongruities, it is a favourite
theory with some, to reform the Indians, and subdue them to the
pursuits of husbandry; but however laudable this scheme may be,
and consonant with the noblest feelings of humanity, I humbly con-
ceive it can never be realized but by the distant enforcements of
education. To change their language, reconcile their prejudices, and
remove the barriers between nature and civilization, is a task of no
ordinary difficulty; and it is easy to forsee, that whilst the Indians
would be pointed to improvement in prospect, their white brethren
would be doomed to a protracted endurance of those calamities, from
which they seek to obtain releif.
Sir, under any system, whether dictated by the unavoidable requisi-
tions of a coercive policy, or emanating from the milder suggestions
of persuasion, there are invincible obstacles to continuing the Indians
in Florida. Amalgamation with the white Inhabitants were in vain,

under the difficulties arising from opposition of character; the measure
of concentrating them is also attended with difficulties, as past ex-
perience has shewn; and if persevered in, the Indian lands would con-
tinue to be the haunts of runaway slaves, and be resorted to by smug-
glers and fugitives from civil authority. The removal of this people
from their original range, and concentration in a spot far inferior in
extent, and quality, to that which they enjoyed is a measure revolting
to themselves. If forced within their boundaries by military power,
no reliance could be placed in their attachment in time of war, but
on the contrary they might become the pioneers to conduct an Enemy
into the interior of the country. Thus circumscribed within an in-
sufficient range, and under a perpetual struggle with their own pro-
pensities; it may be expected that inducements less tempting than
those of hunger, will continue to urge them beyond the lines; but
when the Government annuities shall have been exhausted, and they
can no longer resort to a public crib, what would be their condition
in such extremities? Conflagration and bloodshed have already be-
gun, and I trust I need hardly point to the horrid scenes of predatory
warfare that have stained our frontier history. An aggravation of
the evils complained of, is inevitable; and persuaded as I am that
the immediate removal of the Indians from Florida, would ameliorate
their condition, and promote the prosperity of the Territory; it is my
duty most respectfully to urge this measure on the attention of Govern-
ment. Deprived of the privileges of the chase, they are wanderers in
an inhospitable clime, to whom any change of situation could scarcely
be more unpromising; Beyond the Mississippi there are extensive
ranges in which they could pursue the game, and find ample scope for
their natural propensities, whilst at the same time the paternal hand
of Government, and of the Missionary societies, could, by unincum-
bered efforts, conduct them to a participation of all the benefits of
religion and civilization. Nor would the effects of this measure be
limited to the improvement of the Indians; Florida would be releived
from a disease, which has preyed upon its inhabitants with a morbid
severity, and the General Government would at the same time be
exempted from the embarassments inseparable from reiterated com-
plaint.
Although I contend for the right of the United States, in removing
these Indians, to use coercive measures if necessary, yet I am not
persuaded that such necessity exists. On the contrary, these people
are distinguished from the Creeks and Cherokees, by a superior
gentleness and docility, which would in a great measure incline them
to yeild to impressions of persuasion; and if they are ignorant of the
fact, that the hunting grounds to the West are preferable to those of
Florida, I submit whether a select party of their chiefs could not con-

vince themselves by ocular examination, and communicate this con-
viction to the remainder of the tribe?”
But whatever mode of persuasion may recommend itself; if the
Government be convinced of the expediency of removing these people,
by gentle means if practicable, or by coercive if necessary; and should
think fit to institute a special commission, with instructions embracing
and authorising this alternative mode of proceeding; I take the liberty
to mention Co Duncan L Clinch of Florida and Doctor William H
Simmons, as Gentlemen well calculated to give such instructions
effect.”

* The resolution for an inquiry was introduced by Del. Call, Feb. 3, 1825
(Cong. Debates, 18 Cong., 2 sess., cols. 439-440). In support of the resolution,
Call made a speech containing a number of barbed comments concerning Judge
Smith, of which the following is typical: “From what cause . . . has this extraor-
dinary conduct of the judge originated? Surely he will not plead ignorance of
law, reason, and the rules of decorum? If he does, sir, he is unworthy of the
administration of justice. . . . There is no section or provision of the laws of
the territory, which allows him the privilege of demanding fees. He knows this
was never the intention of the Council to allow him this privilege. I, sir, was an
humble member of the Legislative Council which enacted those laws; it sat in
St. Augustine, the residence of Judge Smith. Twice, during a short session,
did the friends of this gentleman propose to allow him fees for the performance
of his judicial duties, and twice was that proposition rejected, with disdain, by
the Legislative Council. . . . you sent him to us, and we ask you to take
him away.”
Not pertinent to the above but of interest, is the account of Joseph L. Smith
for services as Commissioner under the 9th article of the treaty with Spain in
settling and adjusting claims in the period 1823–1824, dated Mar. 6, 1826 (NA,

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA: WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File: ALS]
TALLAHASSEE, Feb' 10" 1826.
GENERAL, I have the honor to report for your information that I
have been unable to make any contract for opening the Road from
the St: Mary's River to Wanton's, in consequence of the Bids having
exceeded the Appropriation. Copies of the offers made and my cor-
respondence relating thereto are herewith enclosed numbered from
1 to 8.” M* Bellame's offer was the only one to open it so as to make
it a practicable carriage Road in the dry seasons, but he has now
withdrawn his proposals altogether; and in any event I could not
have accepted it, although within the appropriation, having received
no authority to justify me in doing so. I am fully aware that it is
expected this Road will have been commenced by this time, and
nearly finished, which would have been the case but for the absence
of the troops from Pensacola; and it is not now probable that they will
be at liberty for this object at all, or at least for any reasonable length
of time to come. It is expected by the people of the Country, & it
is of importance to them, that this Road should be commenced
forthwith and completed as early as possible. Under these circum-
stances I am satisfied that it would be to the interest of the Govern-
ment for me to hire a gang of negroes, if to be obtained, of which
I have no doubt, & place them under charge of an efficient Superin-
tendent and commence opening the Road immediately; relying upon
a future appropriation to continue the work to its completion. I have
calculated the cost of such a measure closely, and am so well satisfied
that it might be opened in this manner at at equal, if not less, expense
than to move a detachment of troops into that Section of Country
for that object only, that I should not hesitate a moment to adopt
it, provided I found upon enquiry that I could employ the negroes
at a reasonable rate; but the fear that it may not be thought an
economical & saving mode, deters me from doing what I know to be
right, & in fact my duty, in this matter. The Sum appropriated is
too small to effect the object for which it was intended and moreover
the route designated is that which would cause the most expense
to open. When I designated the route by which this Road should
be opened I attended too much to the shortest route & not to the
* Two bids were received to construct the road from Camp Pinckney, on
the St. Mary's River, to Wantons in Alachua. John Bellamy, of Hicks Town,
made a bid of $10,000 on Oct. 10, 1825, and George Fisher, of Tallahassee, one
of $9,000 on Dec. 9, 1825. Burch notified them that their bids could not be
accepted, since they exceeded the appropriation of $6,000. Bellamy withdrew

best, by a close adherence to the letter of the law.—I have long since
made myself perfectly acquainted with the Country generally & with
all the Routes through it by which a Road could pass; and my
Judgement, both for the goodness of the Route, for public convenience,
& for permanence of the Road itself when made, would have led me
to adopt another route; the increased distance of which route would
not have been more than ten miles, if so much. A short descrip-
tion of the Country will enable you to decide the question. The
Country between the Suwannee & St: Johns Rivers and north of
Alachua to the St: Mary's River is altogether a pine Barren entirely
unfit for cultivation or settlement, except in some three or four small
detached places of the poorest sandy Hammock, which are not
sufficient to invite permanent settlement, though there are some
few families residing on them. Leaving the Suwannee River and
proceeding Easterly, the land is rolling Sand hills with a stinted
growth of pine for 35 miles. It then becomes flat pine glades covered
with Saw Palmetto, and extensive Savannahs & cypress Ponds, in
width from 25 to 30 miles, & extending from the St: Mary's River
in a south direction through the middle of that part of Florida into
Alachua; & I believe from the best accounts I can obtain this flat,
wet, region extends quite to the Cape itself. Between this tract
of flat land & the St. John's River is a Ridge of high sand hills or
pine Barren of ten or twelve miles in width. This flat pondy country
supplies the Streams which fall each way from it into the waters of
the Atlantic & those of the Gulf; and although small & insignificant
in dry seasons, yet in wet, rainy weather; are swoln almost to rank
with Rivers. The Route which is designated in the proposals for
the Road passes through this flat country & crosses these Streams.
From recent observation I am satisfied that Bridges on this Route
could not be constructed at any reasonable expense, to stand the
first freshet which might come; and even if they did, as for instance
where it would cross the St: Fé River, it would in all heavy continued
rains be swimming a quarter of a mile to get to the Bridge. In flat
land where the channels of the Streams are small & banks low my
experience proves that it is almost impossible to secure a wooden
bridge at the abutments so as to prevent its floating up. This route
after leaving the ferry at St. Mary's River continues along the
“King's Road” for ten miles, & from thence to Wanton's, there is
not a single Settlement; and from the forbidding Sterile nature
of the Country none can ever be made; hence no Road there could
be kept up.-
The Route which I propose as being the best both for its locality,
& for public convenience, is, to follow the “Kings Road” for about
30 miles to the point where it turns to the South East towards the

St: John's River, and then continues southerly, passing along the
Sand hills bordering upon the St. John's River to Black creek, cross-
ing it at a ferry already established there; thence to the military Road
leading from Pensacola to St. Augustine, & either continuing along
it for five or six miles before turning off for Wanton's, or cross it &
go direct to Wanton's. This Route is one that would be permanent,
not liable to be interrupted by heavy Rains, nor broken up by freshets;
Besides it would have the advantage of Settlements along the route
& would give to the inhabitants of the West bank of the St: John’s
River a Road, which they are now wholly destitute of. It would
moreover open a communication for all the inhabitants of Alachua &
that portion of Florida by good Roads to the tide water of Black
Creek, six miles only from its entrance into the St: John's; and at
the very point too where the canal, if ever one is opened across the
Peninsula of Florida, must be connected with the tide waters of the
Atlantic. It will moreover have the advantage of repairing that
part of the “King's Road” leading to St: Augustine where it is most
needed, & which I suppose will be one of the objects of the Govern-
ment to effect. From the St: John’s to St: Augustine the King's
Road needs but little repairs, as it is now one of the best Roads in
the Southern Country. By inspecting Vignole's map you will per-
ceive that the King's Road runs in a direction, to within 8 or 10
miles of the St: Johns, nearly due South; hence the route which I
recommend as the best for this road is paralell to, and is never more
than ten miles, generally about five miles, distant from that which
was advertised for. I request that you will be pleased to instruct
me on this subject, and if sufficient confidence can be placed in my
Judgement & knowledge of the Country, permit me to locate this
Road according to my discretion.—I also request that I may be
permitted to exercise my discretion in relation to hiring negroes for
its completion, or to have it done by contract as I may find it most
advantageous. And if the General will be pleased to give me early
advice on these subjects, (addressed to me at Pensacola with a dupli-
cate to this place,) I think the Road may yet be completed by efficient
management on my part before the 30" of September next. I do
not expect however to be able hereafter to make contracts on any
terms whatever. The late sale of the lands & settlement of the
Country is unfavorable to getting contracts of small amount made
by responsible men, as they are now engaged in opening plantations.-
Provisions too are exceedingly scarce throughout Florida, corn selling
at $2.50 & $3. per Bushell, with all other articles in proportion.-
I have not recently heard any thing on the subject of opening
military communications between Pensacola and Mobile Point;

Pensacola & Blakely; and between Blakely and Mobile Point; meas-
ures which I considered at all times of great importance, and more
particularly so now that Pensacola is selected as the Naval Depot
for the Gulf. But if the Troops should return to Pensacola during
the ensuing Summer, they can be immediately after, even during the
summer months in that part of the Country, employed to much greater
advantage & economy on these works than on any other Roads in
Florida; and that too at a cost which would not be at all materially
felt by the Q Mrs: Dept. without any additional amount being
added to the appropriations for the support of that Department, —
an argument which ought to weigh much in favor of the employment
of Laborers eleswhere.—
I have just made a partial Settlement with the Barge owners who
transported the Military Supplies &c. up the Appalachicola for the
two Regiments stationed in the Creek Nation. There is due to them
upwards of $.6000, which I was unable to pay from want of funds;
and one of them represented his wants & distresses so forcibly that I
borrowed five hundred dollars to make him a partial payment & four
hundred for the other. In addition to these accounts there is another
for Stores now on their way up, of $.1000.—The expense attending
this Route of Supply is very considerable being more than I had
expected. There were but three Barges on the River, one of which
is wholly destroyed & sunk from injuries received on the upper part
of the River while transporting these supplies. These Boats & men
were employed during the sickly season & when the water was at
its lowest stage, rendering the charge for freight still greater, being
ten dollars per Barrel, but I hope in future to have it done for Seven
or eight dollars.—There being but two Boats however on the River
that can be employed does away all competition, & moreover the
distance is great, being upwards of five hundred miles, without a
single Barrel of return freight to lessen the expense. I am so sensible
that economy & retrenchment is expected that I always feel the most
anxious solicitude lest that in being the instrument, (for I have n[o]free
agency in such matters,) in incurring such heavy disbursements I
may fall under your disapprobation, & be deemed extravagant in my
use of public money; but I am conscious that these expenses are
unavoidable while the Troops are at such remote stations. The
arrears of the Office under my charge have now become very consider-
able & I am extremely desirous to have funds to settle them fully up.—
I have completed the Inspection & received the Road between the
Appalachicola & Ocholochonee Rivers, the contract for the completion
of which was made with M. Bailey. I have also inspected a part of
Mr Bellame's contract & leave here for the St: John's in two or three
days to complete the inspection. He has labored under many diffi-

culties owing to the very extraordinary wet and unfavourable year
past, but I confidently calculate that he will have closed this contract,
and also finished his contract from Picolata to St: Augustine by the
first of May next; when the Road from Pensacola to St: Augustine
will be complete. no additional appropriation for this Road is
required.”

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.—
SIR, I have the honor to enclose herewith an extract of a letter from
Col” Brooke of Florida to Col° Gibson, of this City, on the present
suffering condition of the Florida Indians." The correspondence
with the Department for some time past confirms the truth of Col."
Brooke's statement; and it was in consequence of those representations
that partial relief was authorized by you from the Contingencies of
the Indian Department. Being convinced that the Country to which
those Indians have emigrated is not suited either in soil, or salubrity,
to their preservation, instructions were some weeks ago forwarded
to Governor Duval to ascertain their dispositions in regard to a re-
moval to lands West of the Mississippi. It is hoped they may accede
to the proposition. Meanwhile, however, Humanity demands that
they should be kept from starving. They are, where they are, by
our seeking; and their Country was exchanged as is usually the case,
by Treaty, doubtless, with an ignorance on their part of the nature
of that to which they consented to emigrate; and erroneous informa-
tion on ours, as to its fitness.
I respectfully recommend that the subject of the sufferings of these
people be referr'd to the Congress, that such relief may be afforded,
as in the wisdom of that body may seem proper.

DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Off: Ind: Affairs 21* Feby 1826.
To THE HON” J. M. WHITE Ho: of Rep" U.S.
SIR, In reply to your note of the 18" Ins' " I have the honor to
state that you never did, either in writing or by word, directly, or
indirectly, complain, to me, nor have I heard that you did to any one,
that improper means were used to effect a Treaty with the Florida
Indians.
The sixth reason assigned by Mr Doyle in his letter of the 20th
October last,” to Acting Governor Walton (Mr Doyle having been
sent by that Gentleman to examine into the causes of the unusual
discontent of the Florida Indians,) is in these words, in the language,
as it is understood of the Indians to him, and in reply to his enquiries:—
“That the land allowed them by the Treaty was partly forced on the
Chiefs, and that the Indians never agreed to give up their land.”
The Secretary of War, as well to guard the reputation of the
Commissioners, as to maintain the principles which the Government
expects its Commissioners to maintain in negotiating with the
Aborigines of this Country, directed a letter to be written to the
Commissioners on the implication contained in the foregoing quotation.
The Secretary of War is perfectly satisfied that the Commissioners
took no undue or covert advantage of these people. It was proper,
nevertheless, the implication being exressed, that the inquiry should
be made.—

had not been fairly represented to the President of the United States,
and that great injustice has been done to them, I determined to act
on the order from your department, to explore the Indian Country,
and to report on my own examination, exactly as I should find it
to be—
I have now the honor after a faithful and laborious examination
of their lands for thirteen days to make the following report. The
long Swamp which is on the right of the military road leading from
this place to Tampa Bay, is the first land near the present northern
line, deserving any attention. This Swamp is near Six miles long,
very narrow, and entirely too wet for cultivation, except Thirty
or forty acres at its Southern extremity, which is inhabited by a
family of Indians:—I consider it of little value.—Okahumpki, sig-
nifies in our language One Pond, is an Indian town, the land is too
poor for cultivation & there is very little good land in its neighbour-
hood—Pelacklakaha is a town occupied by the Indian negroes, its
name signifies, Scattered hammoc; there is but little land fit for
cultivation about it, and in the rainy season, the best of it is under
water—Chicuchatty or Red house, is an Indian town on the margin
of a large pond; it appears to be an ancient Settlement:—All the good
lands have been exhausted by cultivation, and it is now poor, un-
healthy, and has no water near that is fit to drink:—the Big Hammoc
is situated near this town. I spent some days in examining it, and
was greatly disappointed in its fertility, extent, and supposed ad-
vantages—The Big Hammock is much lower than the adjoining land,
which is poor pine sandy hills, wholely unfit for cultivation—There
is a large pond in the centre of this hammoc, with several drains,
in the wet season;—it is the greater part under water: in the dry
season there is no water except in this large pond—The soil from its
growth of timber, would induce a passing observer to beleive it very
fertile, but I found on examining the land in many places, that it is a
light mould two or three inches deep based on white sand, and would,
if cultivated, in three years become become a bed of sand—The whole
extent of this Hammoc would not make more than a Township:—
there is but one Small indian settlement in it, and take it altogether,
I feel confident it has been vastly overrated. I think that a man who is
judge of land would not give more than One dollar per acre for the
best of it, above high water mark, which would be but a small part of
the whole Hammoc. I did not travel but a short distance in going
south on the military road; I left it near Okahumpki and examined
the whole country to the right of the road as far as Tampa Bay.
I visited every spot where any lands were spoken of as being good,
and I can say with truth I have not seen three hundred acres of good
land in my whole route after leaving the Agency. The lands on the


## p. 447 (#465) ############################################

F L Q R J D A T E R R H TO R Y 447
Big & Little Withlecoucha are poor, and the land on Hillsboro River
within the Indian boundary, are of so little value, that there is not one
Indian Settlement on any of them—I did not visit Peas Creek, I had
suffered so much from drinking water, alive with insects, from mos-
quitoes, intolerable hot weather, and my horses were so reduced by
the journey, and the swarms of horse flies, that I determined to leave
that point unexplored, having received Satisfactory information
that there is but a small tract of good land in that quarter.—I never
have seen a more wretched tract of Country, than that which I en-
tered five or six miles south of Chucuchatty:—the Sand hills rise very
high, and the Indian trail winds over an extensive Sand ridge for
eight or nine miles; the whole of the timber for this distance as far
as the eye can Survey has been killed by fire; the burnt and blackened
pines, without a leaf, added to the dreary poverty of the land, presents
the most miserable and gloomy prospect I ever beheld—After decend-
ing the Southern extremity of this ridge, I entered a low wet piney
country, spotted with numerous ponds:—I had much difficulty to
pass through them, altho' the season has been uncommonly dry;
had much rain fallen, I never could have reached Tampa Bay in that
direction—So low was the whole country as far as the indian boundary
extended towards Tampa Bay, that after riding all day and until
eleven O'Clock at night, in the hope I would find a dry spot to sleep
upon, I was compelled to take up my lodging on a low wet place for
the night. No Settlement ever can be made in this region, and
there is no land in it worth cultivation—The best of the Indian lands
are worth but little:—nineteen twentieths of their whole country
within the present boundary, is by far the poorest and most miserable
region I ever beheld.—I have therefore to advise as my duty demands,
& the honor and humanity as my country requires, that the Big
Swamp be also given to the Indians, and that the northern side be
fixed five miles North of the Big Swamp, and extended to the Okele-
waha River east and so far west west, as to include the Big Ham-
moc: *—this line will take in no good land but the Big Swamp of
any consequence, but by extending it into the pine barren five miles
it will keep off settlers from the Indian boundary who would otherwise
croud near the line, and sell Whiskey to the Indians—The pine barren
between the south end of Alachua, and the Big Swamp is poor and
never can be cultivated:—the distance is about twenty five miles—
The Big Swamp is six miles long and is about two miles wide and is
healthy, high, rich land "-

REPORT OF HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE TERRITORIES
[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 1 Sess.: AD]
[February 23, 1826]
The Committee on the Teritories to whom was refered on the 14th
of February 1826 the Memorial of sundry inhabitants of the city of
St Augustine in the Teritory of Florida," submit the following report—
The Memorialists, in substance state, that the Sugar Cane will
grow in the vicinity of the city of S’ Augustine and in other parts
of the Teritory to as great perfection as it does in the State of Louisi-
ana—that, as the planters generally in the Teritory have not the
means of establishing suitable works for the manufacture of sugar,
they have formed, in the city of S." Augustine, a “Sugar Mill Com-
pany”—and, the better to secure the success of the enterprise, they
pray Congress to incorporate the company with a capital not exceeding
twenty five thousand dollars.
While the committee do not doubt the power of Congress to estab-
lish corporate rights, for private purposes, in the Teritories of the
United States, they doubt very much the expediency of exercising
the power. The Governor & Legislative Council of florida possess
a general power of legislation, controlled only by the constitution
and laws of the United States, and by the right which Congress has
reserved of disapproving their acts. They ought to be the best judges
of the fitness and propriety of granting charters like the one prayed
for. and it is generally a safe rule to leave these matters of individual
monopoly to the action of the local authorities. The memorialists
however among other reasons for inducing congress to act upon the
subject, state that the Legislative Council of florida will not meet
untill next November—and that some inconvenience will be felt in
consequence of this delay—The committee do not perceive any
thing in this application to take it out of the ordinary cases of Teri-
torial Legislation—And if congress ought to legislate in this case,
because the Council is not in session, why not in every other? But
this Teritory undoubtedly expects to be, and probably will be, at
no distant period, admitted into the union—will pass from a Teritory
to a State—and the Committee are clearly of the opinion that Con-

gress ought not to set up a private monopoly in a Teritory, which

SIR, The Secretary of War directs that you report immediately

enclosing evidence in support of Speight's petition, and requesting a copy of the
evidence and a report on the other side; and Speight to the Secretary of the
Treasury, June 10, 1826 (NA, GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee), requesting
that Call be instructed to make affidavit as to the circumstances of Ward's
conduct in connection with the entry of a quarter section of land. The finale
of this affair is read in the following papers: Graham to Ward, Sept. 24, 1826
(loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 18), inquiring whether, by mistake, a certificate of
purchase had been issued for a tract claimed by Speight, and stating that the
patent would be suspended, Ward to Graham, Oct. 10, 1826 (loc. cit., Reg. and
Rec. Lets., Tallahassee), that Speight had acknowledged Ward to be the rightful
owner of the land by purchasing it from him, and id. to id., Oct. 17, 1826 (loc.

Unrelated to the above is a second letter from Call to Graham, Feb. 24, 1826

advising that Call should draw on the Secretary of the Treasury for payment.
* In the absence of Humphreys, Oren Marsh replied to this letter, May 17,

number of runaway slaves as they were protected by the Indians' negroes, and
many of the runaways had gone to New Providence and Cuba.

ROBERT BUTLER Esqr Surveyor Gen' of Florida Talahassee
SIR, I have to state, that it is discovered your Deputy Surveyors
have charged for surveying the line run by Gen' Coffee as the south
boundary of Alabama, in some instances where said line forms the
North boundary of the adjacent townships in Florida: The same is
the case with those surveys East of the Chattahootchie bounded by
the line run by you between Georgia and Florida—As it is to be
supposed, that the Alabama and Georgia lines were marked with
sufficient distinctions, I can see no necessity for any resurvey of such
portions of them as form the North boundary of the townships
adjacent—There may however, for ought I know, be special instances
where a resurvey of some portions of these lines might be actually
necessary—If such instances were found to be, the Deputy Surveyor
will have to advise you of the particular facts in order that you may
certify them officially—
Mean time, I have to advise you that none of the charges can be
admitted until the First Auditor of the Treasury can be certified that
the resurvey was actually necessary—Your explanation should
therefore be made as soon as practicable—”

seems to be a good workman and attentive to his buisness, his Shop
is yet in want of many tools, a list of which will be presented to you
by the Agent and, I request you will enable him to purchase them in
the North, as they Cannot often be procured in the Southern Country;
By the Treaty no provision was made to Supply the Shop with Iron
and Steel, of Course a Supply of each will be required this fall. I
assure you that nothing is more difficult than to procure working
hands at this place, and workmen demand high wages when they Can
be induced to Come to the Agency, The Sum of $2000 will not be
Sufficient to Complete the Buildings absolutely necessary for the
Agency, if $500 in addition is given, with great economy and manage-
ment it may be enough, but I assure you that this additional Sum in
my judgement is absolutely necessary, when you Calculate the
unusual expence, in a remote Situation, in a Southern and interior—
in building an Agency house a Council house, and the Out houses,
you will find that even the Sum of $2,500 will only put up rude
buildings The Thousand dollars allowed for a Seet! School in the
Nation ought to be for Some time years applied to furnish Spinning
Wheels, Looms, &c. that the Indians are now Soliciting, they are
totally averse to a Scool at present, and it will be time enought, to
attemp such an establishment five years hence
When these people are Completely Settled And have good farms to
Support them the best School for five years will be for them, will be
to teach them the arts, and they will Soon learn the various trades.
I believe one of our greatest mistakes in Our attempts to Civilize the
red men has resulted from neglecting to teach them first the Usefull
arts, we Seem to forget that the wild and roving habits of these
Children of the forest, can not be Changed Suddenly, it would be
difficult to show from the history of any nation that its people, were
summer of 1824, but my presence prevented it. I broke the Head Chief, and he
removed to the Creek nation, where he belonged.
“I consider it highly important that these chiefs should visit Washington, as
they have never been in the United States, and have no idea of the power or
numbers of the country.
“These chiefs are disposed to do their duty, but are afraid to exert their authority
for fear of a part of the nation called the Mickesuky tribe, who are a very bad set
of men. . . . I have not hinted to these people as I was advised to do by your
department, that they might remove to lands West of the Mississippi, because I
felt certain it would alarm them, nor would they be willing to remove unless the
Creek nation would also emigrate. . . . I would, however, most strongly advise
the establishment of a military post near the agency; this measure will be attended
with many benefits to the inhabitants as well as the Indians.”

These people will raise Cotton immediately had they wheels to
spin and Looms to weave it, Would it not be of infinite advantage to
these people if a wheel wright, and a Cooper was Settled at the
Agency who would take the young Indians as apprentices. The arts
they are fond of Learning and in a few years, they would have work-
men among themselves
I am more and more Convinced that the Slaves belonging to the
Indians are a Serious nusance, they have by their art and Cunning the
entire Controul Over their Masters the negros are all hostile to the
white people and are Constantly Counteracting the advice and talks
given to the Indians; and on Several occasions, after they have
promised the Agent in Council to attend to his advice on their return
to their villages their Slaves have persuaded them to disregard it
It is a great misfortune that the Indians have Slaves and it is wise
policy if our object be to promote the happiness of these people to
induce them to Sell their negro" they are of no manner of Servise to
their masters, An Indian who has 20 Slaves has not Corn annually
from their labour, to feed his wife and Children. I would therefore
urge that the Secretary advise them to Sell their Slaves as Soon as
they Can find purchasers and Clear out all free negros from the
Nation
If this was done you would never hear of the planters Complaining
that their Slaves were Constantly runing away from them into the
Indian nation, which has been and is now the fact not less than four
gentleman have met me at this place in order to reclaim Slaves now
among the Indian negros who are in the habit of enticing them from
their masters and hiding them in the thick hammocks
I request you will grant permission to the Agent to purchase some
of these Slaves for the use of the Agency or for his own use as you
may think proper
I have given him permission to purchase one and if your department
does not think it improper I shall give permission to any white man
to purchase of the Indians by going to the Agent and making the
Contract before in his presence to avoid all misunderstanding or fraud

[NA:GAO, Misc. Treas. Accts., No. 50,248 (1825):ALS]
Marshals Office PENSACOLA W. F. March 3. 1826.
SIR, Enclosed you will receive Abstracts of my account, for the
Court expenses of the Novr. Term 1825–
I found it not necessary to Summon neither grand or petit Jurors,
for the two Courts held in Jackson County in the Spring and fall of
1825; neither for the two last Courts in this place in same year, did I
summon petit Jurors. I thought it proper to Save the government,
this useless expense; as they were not ordered by the District Judge.
This is the reason why the Court Expenses, are less for 1825 than I
anticipated, when you made me the advance in Decr. 1824—The
Balance due in my hands, is subject to be accounted for at any time,
and will I presume be sufficient to pay the Court expenses for this
year.
I paid John Miller the Clerk of the Superior Court, the amount of
money as specified in his receipt, and had it with me when I was in
Washington in Decr. 1824; but his account was not made out in form;
it was therefore returned—He has sent it on to the Delegate from this
Territory, as I learn—He is now dead—What ever should be allowed
him on his accounts I shall expect to operate to my credit—If any
more should be allowed him, than my receipt calls for, you will draw
on me for the money, through the Delegate, who is endeavouring to
obtain the payment for some accounts, that cannot be paid, from the
regular fund for paying Court expenses—
The three items charged in No 5, should have been in No 4. but I
have cost the Commission notwithstanding, correctly, I believe"—
I have the honour Sir, to be very respectfully your most obt. Sevt.

for him to have transported with him all the Reg" Papers. It
arrived at Pensacola in two vessels, a Brig and Schooner, provided
by the Qr. Masters Department at New Orleans, and which I should
have thought was sufficient. When the Battalion arrived at Pensa-
cola it landed under the command of Capt. Gale, who remained in
Command as long as I was performing the duties of Q'master connected
with its further march into the Creek nation—When it marched from
Pensacola I was unable to procure from the neighbouring Country
the requisite means of transportation by land, and it marched with
three Carts (all I could get in Pensacola) as far as the ferry where
they were to cross the Conecuh River; the remainder of such baggage
as was to be transported with the Battalion, with the selection of
which I had nothing to do, being sent to the same point in a Barge
provided for the purpose, from whence the whole was transported
in waggons with the Battalion. I refer to the enclosed extract of a
letter from Capt Gale for your further information on this subject.”—
The Road from Pensacola to St. Augustine, owing to very heavy
rains, was not like to be completed so that I could finish its inspection
and receive it and as my duty required I should be at Pensacola I
could not wait then and I therefore deemed it proper to extend the
time to the 30” June next. I however confidently calculate that both
this part of the Road and that from St. Johns into St. Augustine
will be completed by the time I stated in my letters of the 10" Ulto:*—
Although the contract for the Road stipulated it should be ready
by the 1* of January last yet I thought this extension was proper
under the existing circumstances. The year had been uncommonly
wet, rendering it impossible to work in the low flat ground until late
in the fall by which much time was lost, and also in following my
directions at different times designating the Points where the contrac-
tor should work; By which means the most material part of the Road
was opened and travelled on long previous to the time when the whole
should have been completed. In extending the time however I
shall require from the contractor to make good any part of it now
completed which may by storms or otherwise become injured before
it is actually received by me. I enclose copies of my letters to him
extending the time on this Contract; and as I believe I have acted
for the real interest of the U. States in this case I trust the General
will approve the course I have pursued.”
I have the honor to be Sir, with Perfect respect Your Obt. Servi.

(Copy.) Military Road, FLORIDA, Febuary 26* 1826
SIR, In consequence of the extreordinary wet and very unfavorable
year, for working on Roads in a low country, in which you was re-
quired by your Contract to complete the Road from the Ocklocknee
to the St Johns River in Florida rendering it altogether impracticable
to work upon some sections of the Road I have deemed it advisable
to extend the time specified therein for its completion to the 30" day
of June next ensuing. This however is not to be construed as giving
you any authority to defer or delay the completion of the Road until
that time; on the Contrary, it is to be distinctly understood that the
Road is to be completed in the shortest possible time from and after
this date. I have also to advise you that no further extension beyond
the time above stated will be hereafter granted; and also that it will
be expected of you to complete your Contract from Picolata to St.
Augustine by the date contracted for. The mail having Commenced
its route between the Cities, Pensacola and St. Augustine, under the
expectation that this Road will afford immediate facilities for its
transportation increases the necessity of its being completed.
Having inspected and examined the Road between the Ocklocknee
& this place Chiefly without your presence, it is proper for me to
point out certain defects & deficiency in its construction, which it
will be required of you to alter and improve; under that article of
your Contract which provides that my directions in the construction
of the Road shall govern.—You will find them specified in the en-
closed memorandum which will be also considered as a guide & direc-
tion in completing the remainder of the Road under your two con-
tracts therefor.—

From the Ocklocknee to the Ausillee River the work is for the most
part completed to accord with my views & instructions; but the Bridge
on the East side of Tallahassee at the foot of the Hill must be covered

with hewed puncheons or plank; and the Causeways between “Chaire's
plantation” & the “Gum Swamp” are to be more fully thrown up and
covered with earth; also the first one immediately east of the “Gum
Swamp”.—
East of the Ausillee River at the “Cypress Pond” some more work
has become absolutely necessary. The poles & logs of which this
causeway is made must be more firmly secured & pinned down; and
the Bridge raised at least two feet higher. The water in the late rains
floated both up in such a manner as to render it dangerous & almost
impassible. The first long Causeway (made of earth alone thrown
up,) beyond Richardsons towards the Ausillee, is so boggy as to re-
quire to be poled. There is another shorter one on that section of
Road in the same situation, & requiring also to be poled. About two
miles East of Richardson's also there is a cypress pond which has
been Causewayed with poles and which requires to be extended and
to be more fully covered with earth. There is a very material defect
in all the small Causeways thrown up with earth only, & in some
cases those made with Poles, which perhaps did not occur to you at
the time, but now that the country is filled with water, is very per-
ceptible. These are for the most part in low pondy places having
some descent or fall, of course the water naturally inclines to run off,
and as there is no way left for it to fall off, the causeway becomes a
dam for the water to rise to the height of itself; and in many cases
the water is now more than a foot higher on the upper side than on
the lower side of the Causeway's, making a break directly over them,
washing away the earth and sand. This will of itself soon destroy
the labour done, & moreover, it renders the Road in such places worse
to pass over than if nothing at all had been done therein. There
should have been in all such causeways, whether of poles covered
with earth, or of earth alone, an open space left in the middle, (or in
the lowest part of the ground as the case might be,) with a ground
pole Bridge laid down therein ten or twenty feet wide, and the poles
laid level with the ground secured by riders pinned down over each
end, over this the water would have a free passage without either
washing off the earth from the other parts of the causway or raising
it in a pond on either side higher than the surface of the ditches them-
selves. This alteration must yet be made in all the causeways of a
description to require it, and of which you will satisfy yourself by a
slight inspection of the causeways themselves and observing where
they have been washed.

away their slaves:—from time to time they have made their complaints
to the Governor & Indian Agent, who are unable to enforce their
Orders in the Indian nation for want of Military Aid;—It is well
known to Your Memorialists that many of the Florida Indians are a
turbulent, & lawless set who have fled from the Laws & Justice of
their own Nations for refuge among the Seminoles—Your Memorial-
ists who have from time to time lost their Slaves, have, under the
provisions of the late Treaty demanded them of the Indians in vain;
their slaves are secreted by them, and all the talks of the Governor &
Agent, have been so far unavailing—the Indians have hitherto refused
to deliver them—
Your Memorialists further state that without an adequate force,
they will never be able to recover their property.—The Governor has
told Your Memorialists, that he has frequently applied to the Govern-
ment for power to call out the Military to scourthe Swamps in the Indian
boundary, and to recover their runaway slaves, and that as yet, no
such power has been given to him—Some of Your Memorialists have
lately had a personal interview with Governor Duval, at the Florida
Agency who has assured them, that unless the Government will put
under his command a sufficient force to execute his orders, he must
abandon all further attempts to manage the Indians, and Your
Memorialists must be compelled to abandon their plantations on the
River S" Johns, and in the county of Alachua, unless the Governor is
furnished with the force necessary to keep the Indians in their bound-

morialists must be ruined, or driven to make reprisals on the Indians
which may end in a war of extermination.

interposition of the President, and hope their humble Petition will be

DAVIS FLOYD TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 1 sess: CS *]
[March 6, 1826]
HON. RICHARD RUSH Secretary of the Treasury—
SIR, Having been informed by the Hon. Joseph M. White, that
impressions unfavourable to the Commissioners of East Florida, had
been made by a recent publication in one of the public prints, of an
extract from a letter purporting to have been written by a gentleman
travelling through Florida, and also by the statements of certain indi-
viduals remonstrating against the continuance of the board; I feel
that it is my duty to make a reply to your department, and refute so
far as in my power such illiberal imputations. The most important
complaint seems to be, that the Board have in their adjudications per-
mitted counsel to consume the time of the board in argument (which
made it necessary to have counsel on both sides—) which ought to
have been devoted to the adjudication ef on the claims; and this for
the purpose of prolonging as much as possible the existence of the
board. It is true that most of the claims are advocated by professional
men, who claim the right of being heard on such questions as might
arise either as to the evidence or the merits of the grants themselves.
That the exercise of this right to present the cases in the most favour-
able light to the board, may in some measure have procrastinated and
delayed the progress of the Commission, is admitted, but that it was a
privilege that could not be denied or witheld, and is incident to the
very nature of those claims must be asserted. This has been alledged
as the reason why the whole of the business has not been concluded—
The history of the commission since its establishment, will prove
that the translators employed could not by any industry, translate
more than they have done, and the proceedings of the board in no
case have interrupted that part of their duty—That the business of
investigating and probing, into the secrets of Spanish grants &
bringing to light frauds and forgeries would not be popular with
persons interested & that those who were the means of detecting and

exposing such nefarious transactions would thereby make to them-
selves enimies, will be readily admitted and was reasonably expected.
That there are cases of a doubtful & suspicious character, and which
have been held back by the claimants, in the hope that the business
might fall into more favourable hands is confidently believed, and
hence a solicitude for a change was calculated on—
Should those insinuations have weight, I conceive that it will be
but justice to compare the report and labours of the Commissioners of
East Florida, with the report of other Commissioners, and see how far
they have fallen short of others for the same length of time, & further
to examine the rules and principles tipen whieh they have deeided
which have governed them in their decisions and should the subject
be examined according to the said rules, the Commissioners of East
Florida feel satisfied that they will be released from such ungenerous
imputation—"

what I considered a trespass committed by Doctor James Hall—As
the District Atty. was of opinion that Hall ought not to be pre-
vented from disposing of the Live Oak on the Lands refered to, no
prosecution was or could be commenced against him; but as I was of
a different opinion, and as at that time several persons somewhat
semilarly situated with Hall, were about to cut Live Oak, I considered
it my duty as far as possible to put a stop to it, and enjoined in the
hands of the Contracter the Balance due to Hall, which deterred
others from selling Live Oak from lands the titles to which were
pending before the Land Commissioners and the result very doubtful—
Persons claiming Lands under doubtful titles, are constantly
endeavouring to sell the timber, and many have succeeded in cutting
and removing it—I have at considerable trouble and some expence
investigated many titles and where I found them unquestionably
defective, have interfered and prevented the timber from being cut.
I enclose the claim, under which Doctor Hall has assumed the
right to sell timber,” you will observe that the Memorial and con-
ditional Grant locates the Land on the East side of the Road leading
from St. Augustine to Saint Nicholas on Dewee's Creek—under the
claim they were cutting Live Oak on Julington Creek about Six miles
West of said Road, and I should Judge at least eight miles from the
place named in the enclosed papers—Not one condition named in
Governor Coppingers Decree of 5" June 1818. has been complied
with and had the Heirs of Pritchard” confined themselves to the
Lands for which they petitioned, I cannot imagine any authority they
have to dispose of the Timber, until the Water Saw Mill is erected.
A person is now extensively engaged in Cutting Live Oak from
Lands, claimed under one of the Rattemburys' grants, excluded by
the treaty with Spain, and which has been presented to and rejected
by the Land Commissioners—one or two Cargoes have already been
shipped—I was not informed of the fact until a few days since—I
shall endeavour to stop any further shipment if possible and recom-
mend to the District Attorney a prosecution against the trespasser—
I do not know a single instance where the trespassers on public
Land, are worth a Dollar, they are generally persons without property
and if Judgement was obtained against them, would not be able to
pay even the Costs of Suit—Still prosecutions might deter others
from committing like depredations—

I also beg leave to remark, that the District of Country from which
timber has been cut for the last two years, is nearly two Hundred
miles in extent; and the Public Domain cannot be guarded against
tresspass, but at some expence; a tour through that part of the Country
three or four times each year between the months of November and
May (the Season of cutting Timber) would in my opinion very soon
put a stop to these depredations—
There is some choice timber on the Public Lands, and it is well
worth protecting which may be done at a small expence”—

selected to superintend the execution of these operations. He will
have with him seven officers: so that he, with one officer, may make
the surveys of the rivers, bays, and harbours from S' Mary's to S"
Augustine, while the remainder of the brigade, divided into two
parties, of three officers each, under the direction of experienced
officers, may make such other surveys of two or more routes as the
Board may designate.

if the Board do not see any objection to it, or to any other arrange-

SIR—I herewith transmit to you a paper, as a sample of the claims,
which have been and are daily present to the Agent and myself for
slaves, said to be in the Siminole Nation. It is these claims which
have in a great degree, occasioned so much dissatisfaction with the
claimants as will as with the Indians—I have repeatedly, urged on
your Department the absolute necessity, of addopting measures and
prescribing rules under which these claims may be decided—
I have with the assistance of the Agent, been ingaged for sometime,
in endeavouring to convince the Indians of the necessity of bringing
to the Agency all runaway slaves, they have since my arrival here
dilivered over to the owners several slaves, but many are yet claimed
by the White people that the Indians aver to be their property—The
following questions are submitted to your department. First, are
the slaves and other properety taken by the Indians from the citizens
during the late war to be given up—and if so, what indemnity is to
be offered to the Indians for the slaves Horses & cattle, captured
from them during the war, which in value can not be less than $100:
000—am I to enquire in to the right of property—in the nation claimed
by the citizens of Florida, which was held by and in possession of the
Indians before the diliverity of Florida to the United States—and if
so, how far back is the examination to extend—
3" Where citizens have purchased property from the Indians
shortly before the surrender of Florida, by allarming the Indians by

telling them that the americans were coming immideately to take
possession of the country and that they would take from the Indians
their slaves, Horses, and cattle, and urging them to sell, in order to
save some part of their property—and these advisers then became
the purchases for trifling sums of valuable, slaves & other property—
which has run back to the indian nation, ought this property so
obtained, under these false, representations now to be dilevered up
to such claimants
The difficulty and trouble which these claims produce is incal-
culable, I cannot consent to that sort of left handed justice which
gives all that is demanded to our citizens, & which withholds justice
from this cheated abused and persecuted race, I beg again for the
establishment of a military post near the Agency—I assure you it is
all important to secure the rights of the indians as will as the peace

Also six other Negroes, slaves which were the property of an
Indian Named Nacusily, who by his bill of sale made upon the 16"
day of June 1821. before Antonio, then Interpreter & agent for said
Indians under the Spanish Government, sold, and conveyed said
Negroes to Your petitioner, & one Francis Ferreira, a translation
whereof, the Orignial being in Spanish will in due time be submitted

aged at the date thereof, as follows To Wit Kitty, about twenty One
Years of age, and one child about Two years old, Peggy about twenty
two years old, and a child about One year old—Fanny about fifteen
Years of age, and George a boy about ten years old, Your petitioner
also charges, that since the aforesaid purchase, all, or some of the
Negro Women named in said Bill of sale have had additional increase
in children, but how many, or of what sex, or name, or names, your
petitioner is unable to say, but alledges that all the children thus &
since born follow the condition of their, or his, or her respective
Mothers, or mother, That since the said purchase of the said Negroes
by your petitioner, & the s” Francis Ferreira, Your petitioner has
become the sole proprietor of said Negroes, for a Valuable Considera-
tion by him, to the s” Ferreira paid for his interest, and which was
accepted by said Ferreira in discharge of his interest in the said
Slaves, which will in due time be shewn, all of which said Negroes
your petitioner from the best information, he has been able to collect
says are at a creek called Pea's Creek, or on the Waters thereof, and
amongst the Indians belonging to the aforesaid agency.
Also a Negro man named John which your petitioner bought of
Francis Ferreira, by Bill of sale dated the 6" day of March 1824.
who bought said Negro of an Indian (whose property he then was)
as appears by a Bill of sale bearing date the 8" day of October 1821.
upon the same day—the Name of the Indian, who executed said Bill
of sale, and to whom said Negro belonged, is Enochee the s” slave at
the date of the last recited bill of sale as appears by the face thereof
was then Eighteen Years of age, Both of said bills of sale are now here
to the court shewn—the said slave is believed to be at Topkalipeka

Your Petitioner avers, that he has good & Legal claim to all and
each of the slaves aforesaid. He further shews, that he does not

SIR I have the honor to report, that in obedience to your instruc-

possible and on touching at Pensacola, found Col° Walton the Secy
of E. Florida, especially deputed by the Gov" and Council to proceed
to Key West on important public service; I accordingly received him
on board and sailed as early as practicable, coasting along to Key
West where we arrived on the 9* Feb” I am happy to state that the
Secy succeeded here to his entire satisfaction and the interest of the
Territory by collecting several thousand Dollars, due the same;
Our water being out and none to be procured on the Keys fit for use,
on the 13* Feb’ we ran over to Havanna, to procure it, Col° Walton
accompaned us; on the 19" we returned to Key West; found here
the R. Cutter Pulaski Capt Polk; desirous to accompany us down the
Bay; accordingly sailed on the 23" touching and stopping three days
at the Dry Tortugas harbour, from whence we sailed for Tampa and,
arrived there on the first day of March, Gov" Duval here visited us,
from whom a letter accompanies this report directed to you.
We left Tampa Bay March 9" and coasted along to the Westward,
arriving at Pensacola on the 14* from whence we sailed the 16" and
arrived here this day.
From any information we could collect on this cruize—no frauds
have been recently committed on the Revenue; but from the great
facilities, presented to smugglers, on this coast a vigilence in the
Revenue Cutters can only maintain such a state of things.
It is perhaps my duty to acquaint you for the information of the

bills besides due's on bond; that the remnant of the naval establish-
ment at that place, being about to remove, there appears little
security, for so much public Treasure, The improbability of large
demands on that office by the Gov"—perhaps will induce, steps to

dated March 3" 1826,” for the Survey of a route for a canal between
the Atlantic & the Gulf of Mexico. The act contemplates two routes:
one from S" John's river to Vasassatissa Vassasousa Bay, the other
from S' Mary's river to the Appalachicola river or Bay. Both
routes are to be Surveyed & examined with reference both to a boat
canal, & a Ship-channel destined to connect the Atlantic with the
Gulf of Mexico.
From the few documents we could procure tipen relating to the
country through which these canals should pass, we infer that the
S" John's route will ascend, in Succession, the valleys of S" John's
river, its tributary Black Creek, the South Fork of this creek; then
will descend, in Succession, Alligator Creek, Sampson's Creek, Santa
Fè river, Suwanee river. The Summit ground will be between the
head of South-Fork & that of Alligator Creek.
From the Same documents, the S" Mary's route will ascend S"
Mary's river to its Sources, then continue to the Fork formed on the
Suwanee by A-la-pa-pa-ah river & Withlococha river, from whence
the line will descend into the Bay of S* Mark. From this Bay the
route will run to Ockalockony Bay, & from this Bay to Appalachicola
Bay.

Besides these two routes of canal, which are to be Surveyed &
examined before the hot Season of Summer, other Surveys or rather
Soundings are to be made afterwards along the atlantic coast from
S' Mary's harbour to the mouth of S" John's river, & along the coast
upon the gulf of Mexico from Pensacola to Vassasousa Bay.
It is proper to remark that the Surveys, levellings, Soundings
directed by the following instructions must be considered, only as
preparatory to those which might may be performed hereafter.
Their object is, for the present, to test the topography & hydrography
of the country, & find out the local circumstances favourable to
determine the routes which ought afterwards to be surveyed after-
wards more fully.
The Survey is intrusted to two parties: one which will perform all
the operations upon the Eastern Side, a Second which will perform
those upon the Western Side of the Peninsula. As their operations
must be connected & directed to the Same object, we have thought
it better to draw up instructions for the whole, taking care, however,
that the Share allotted to each party Should be Separate & distinct.
Survey to be performed by the Eastern Party.
1° Eastern Section of St John’s route.
The channel of St John’s river, from the bar, at the mouth of the
Stream, to the mouth of Black Creek must be Surveyed & Sounded,
& the width of the channel determined for a depth of water of 9 feet.
Informations must be taken upon the rise & fall of the Stream occa-
sioned by freshets, wind, tide. The minimum & maximum height of
water upon the bar must be ascertained. The lowest level of the Sea
over this bar is to be assumed as the plane of comparison to which all
the levelling profiles under these instructions are to be referred.
A line of levels will be run from the mouth of St John's river to a
point opposite the mouth of Black Creek, with a view to ascertain
whether, to avoid the circuitous route through the river, a canal could
run in that direction. Care ought to be taken to follow the ground
which will require the least excavation & & afford the most easy
cutting: an observation to be attended to in all the Surveys under
these instructions. At each end of this line the best Spot is to be
Selected for the location of a lock.
This line, being Supposed to cross the Stream & to Strike the
opposite Side at a point favorable to the erection of a lock, will con-
tinue along Black Creek & its South Fork & reach the Summit of the
dividing gretthd ridge, between South Fork & Alligator Creek at its
lowest point of depression. It will then descend to Sampson's Pond.
Here a Bench-Mark is to be made, which will Serve to connect the

Survey of the Eastern Section of the S*John's route, with that of the
Western; it ought to be placed at the entrance of Alligator creek into
Sampson's pond. Both parties must therefore understand each other
upon this point of connexion.
The extent of Sampson’s pond, of that the pond at the head of
South-Fork, their depth & content of water must be, if not measured,
at least estimated, the quantum of water they yield at their respective
outlets must be gauged & informations taken as to the variation of the
Supply through the different Seasons of the year.
The Same computation, gauging, & informations must be attended
to in relation to Pithlachuca Lake, & Orange Lake which lie respec-
tively at the heads of Cascowilla branch & Orange Lake Creek tribu-
tary of St John's river. These two lakes are represented by the map
as very extensive; they must therefore be examined with a view to be
used as reservoirs destined to feed the Summit level of the S" John's
canal. Therefore, the difference of level between these lakes &
Sampson's lake must be ascertained, & a line of feeder run from
Orange lake to Pithlachuca lake, & from Pithlachuca lake to Sampson's
lake. The elevation & length of a dam, at the outlet of Orange lake
destined to raise the level of this lake & back its waters into Pithla-
chuca lake, must be determined.
In the prosecution of these Surveys, the nature of the ground must
be carefully noted, as also the building materials afforded by the
country. All the Streams which might be used as feeders must be
gauged. These informations & gaugings are to be attended to in all
the Surveys under the present instructions.
This eastern Section of canal being Surveyed, an experimental line
of canal must be run from Colvill Old Field to S' Mary's harbour, &
commencing at a point of the Survey along Black creek, & at a Bench-
Mark left there for the purpose. The object of this experimental line
is to determine whether the canal ought to debouch into S' Mary's
harbour in preference to the mouth of S" John's. When crossing
Nassau river, it will be necessary to examine, in a westerly direction,
the intervening ground between the fork of this river & St Mary's
river with a view to ascertain whether the waters of the latter might
be diverted into the former, to feed a Section of canal from Colvill Old
Field to S' Mary's harbour. This Section is to terminate in S"
Mary's harbour at a point convenient to the erection of a guard lock.
2° Eastern Section of St Mary's Canal.
The point at which the foregoing Section terminates into S' Mary's
harbour is to be considered as the eastern end of the S" Mary's canal.
From this point, an experimental line of levels must be run through
the most favorable ground with a view to reach, by a canal, the upper

F L Q R J D A 7" E H R H TO R Y 479
fork of S’ Mary's river, & thence to the lakes or ponds lying at the
head of Big Creek.
These lakes or ponds are to be examined with care, their extent,
depth & content of water estimated, the quantum of water they yield
at their respective outlets gauged. Informations are to be taken in
relations to the difference of supply through the year. All these
researches are necessary to ascertain the practibility of using these
ponds or lakes as reservoirs to feed the Section of canal from St
Mary's river to the upper fork of the Suwanee river.
From the upper lake or pond the line of canal must be continued,
through favourable ground, & the lewest peint ef depressieh ef the
ridge to the upper fork of Suwanee river; pushing by the lowest point
of depression of the ridge which divides the head of St Mary's river
from the tributaries of Suwanee river. a Bench-Mark made there will
connect the western end of this Section with the eastern end of the
Section to be Surveyed by the party employed upon the gulf of Mexico.
The Suwanee, at its upper fork, must be, not only gauged, but also
informations are to be taken in relation to its rise & fall at different
Seasons of the year.
3° Soundings along the coast.
When the Surveys & levellings relative to the foregoing eastern
Sections of canals shall have been completed, the party will repair to
S” Augustin to plot their work, write their descriptive memoir &
repert Send this whole, as early as practicable, to the Engineer de-
partment. Then they will resume their operations, & direct them to
the Soundings along the coast.
The channel, from S' Mary's harbour to the mouth of St John's
river, & running between the main & Amelia,—Talbot,—& Fort S*
George—Islands must be sounded in order to ascertain what craft
it can admit in its present state of navigation, & also how it might be
used to connect the two harbours. The bar at the entrance of St
Mary's river is to be Sounded with care, & the height of water upon
this bar given for at its minimum & maximum; the Same is to be
done for the bar at the entrance of S" Augustin harbour.
These Soundings being completed, the party will repair to S'
Augustin, report to the Engineer Department, & wait at S*Augustin
for further instructions
Survey to be performed by the Western Party.
1° Western Section of St John’s route.
The channel of Suwanee river, from the bar, at the entrance of the
Stream into Vassasousa Bay, up to the mouth of S* Fë river, must


## p. 480 (#498) ############################################

be Surveyed & Sounded, & the width of the channel given for nine
feet depth. Informations must be procured in relation to the rise
& fall of the Stream caused by freshets, wind, tide. The height of
water upon the bar is to be determined for at its minimum & maxi-
mum. The lowest level ef of the Surface of the gulf over this bar is
to be assumed as the plane of comparison to which all the levelling
profiles, under these instructions, are to be referred.
An experimental line of levels must be ran from the mouth of the
Suwanee to the mouth of S" Fè river, & along the most favourable
Side of the Suwanee, with a view to ascertain the practicability of
a Section of canal in that direction.
The line will then continue, along either Side of S** Fé river, to the
point where this Stream flows out of its Subterraneous passage, thence
to the opposite end of the passage & it will Peaeh, through Sampson's
creek to Sampson's pond & to the mouth of Alligator's creek, where
a Bench-Mark is to be erected to connect the Western with the
Eastern Survey. Both Parties must therefore agree upon the Se-
lection of this point of junction.
By means of this Bench Mark, the difference of level between the
Atlantic, at the mouth of S" John's river, & the gulf, at the mouth
of the Suwanee, will become ascertained as well as the altitude of
the Summit ground above both levels.
At the end of this Eastern Section into the Suwanee or into the
Wassasousa Bay, the best spot is to be Selected for the location of a
lock.
In the prosecution of all the Surveys, under the present instructions,
care ought to be taken to follow the ground which will require the
least excavation & afford the most easy cutting; the nature of the
ground must be noted, as also the building materials afforded by the
country; all the Streams which might be used as feeders are to be
gauged at proper points; all ponds, lakes which might be considered
as reservoirs to Supply the canal are to be examined & investigated
in their extent, depth, & quantum of water they wettlé-preetire can
afford.
Having completed the Survey from the mouth of the Suwanee to
that of Alligator creek, the party will return to the mouth of S**
Fè. From a point there, where a Bench-Mark must have been left,
a line of levels is to be ran along the most favorable Side of the Suwanee
up to the fork formed by the A-la-pa-pa-ha river & Withlococha river.
The object of this experimental line is to ascertain if whether a Sec-
tion of canal could be made in that direction, &, at the Same time,
to connect the Survey & levelling of the Western Section of the, S'
John's canal, with the Eastern & Western Section of the S' Mary's
canal.

2° Western Section of St Mary's canal.
The party having agreed with the Eastern party as to a common
Bench-Mark at the upper fork of the Suwanee (confluence of the
A-la-pa-pa-ah & Withlococha), a line of canal must be Surveyed from
this point to S' Mark, & where it te will terminate into S' Mark's
river, below S" Mark, & at a Spot favourable to the location of a
guard lock.
The line then crossing S' Mark's river to a point on the opposite
shore favourable to the erection of a guard lock, it will be continued
to the Ockalockony Bay & debouch into it at a proper Spot for the
location of a guard lock. It will then ascend Ockalockony river to
a point, above Crooked river, where a guard lock might be erected,
& from thence, crossing New river, it will reach the Bay of Appa-
lachicola, & terminate into it at the a point favorable peint to the
location of a guard lock.
After having completed the Surveys & levellings relative to the
foregoing Sections of canals, the party will repair to Tallahassee to
plot their work, draw up their descriptive memoir, & send their the
whole, as early as practicable, to the Engineer Department.
They will then resume their operations & direct them to the follow-
ing Soundings along the coast.
3° Soundings along the coast.
The party will Sound & ascertain the minimum depth of water
upon the bars at S** Rosa-Bay, S' Andrew's Bay, St Joseph’s Bay,
Appalachicola Bay, Ockalockony Bay; as also at the passes into S**
Rosa Sound, & S. George Sound. These two Sounds, as also Crooked
river, must be Sounded with a view to ascertain the kind of craft
which might navigate their waters at the lowest Stage of tide.
These Soundings being performed, the party will return to Talla-
hassee, then Send their report & results of their operations to the
Engineer Department, & wait there for further instructions.
The general instructions Sent by the Board for the Surveys of
canals & gauging of Streams must be attended to in the performance
of the operations here above enumerated; but in order to lessen the
time employed in the platting of the work, a Scale of ehe four inches
to a mile will be adopted for the maps & for the horizontal axis of
the profiles: as to the coordinates the Scale will be one inch for fifty
feet.
It is very desirable that the memoirs drawn up by each party
should contain every Suggestion which might elucidate the Subject
contemplated by the resolution of Congress, & be conducive to the
best location of a canal destined to connect, through the peninsula
of Florida, the Atlantic with the Gulf of Mexico.

CO" THOMAS L. M"KENNY Genl. Suptr of Indian Affairs
SIR I have had the honor to received at this place your letters
of the 4" * and 11" of Jan' last * the first with a copy of a memorial
from the citizens of Alacuha County—the investigations shall be
made into the charges set forth against the agent and I have given
notice that on the 23" Int, I will attend in Alachua at the house of
Co" Piles to receive any evidience which the citizens can offer against
the agent, and inviuting those who signed the memorial and all
persons concerned to come forward on that day—I will in due time
report, the facts & evidence to your department, you will see by my
report on the quallity of the lands within the present Indian boundary
that I have declined running their line untill my report shall be acted
on and as a deputation of the chiefs are about to visit the President,
on this subject, it would be very impolitick if not unjust to take any
steps in this buisness—untill they hear from the Secretary of War
the result of my report. I have seen the letter you adressed to
Maj Coffee, his name, is not John, but, Joshua A. Coffee—It is my
wish to superinted the running and marking of the lines in person
this I have promised to the Cheifs to do and I had engaged Majr.
Coffee to act as surveyor—The running of the boundary line is a
matter of great moment with these people—and if I was not present
they would be dissatisfyed. and suspicious of its validity, during
the fall or early part of the winter the line can be run, but it is now
too late, in the season to attempt it. I wish to have Majr. Coffe as
Surveyor and an order for a detachment under some officer, with the
necessary transportation provisions &c. when they shall be required.
I would prefer to be allowed to run the Norther line as I may deem
20 The reference here should be to the act mentioned at the opening of the
document.

proper so as to embrace the big swamp. I am informed that to run
the line straight in a northerly direction, would embrace a body of
good land owned by individuals who tittles to the same has been
confirmed by the board of commissioners I would therefore be best
to frame the order for including the big Swamp, in such manner, as
will enable me to run the line so as not to include any other body of
good, land. (if your Department should dertemine to give up the big
Swamp to the Indians) they should have it in my opinion, if humanity
or justice is to govern, permit me to advise that the agent be fur-
nished with so much of the funds, to be applid to the buildings of the
Agency as will enable him to purchase all the locks, hinges, nails
glass, crews, paints &c. at the north. this would be a considerable
saving as they can be had at least 40 per cent. cheaper their than
in Florida
The Indians since my talk, on the 23* Feby last * have with in a
few days past diliverd up many runaway slaves—I think their is yet
remaing about 20 slaves in the nation which they have yesterday
promised to find and diliver at the agency in eight days from this time,
I believe that my presence has done much to effect this and bring the
nation into order, the circumstance of my viewing their lands, has had
a happy influence on them and my report, if sanctioned by the Presi-
dent, will give to myself and the agent great influince over these
People—I beg that the chiefs who visit the City may be treated with
much attention and that their presents may be liberal, such a couse
will forever bind the chiefs to the government, I wish you would con-
verse a large with Co" Humphreys as to the manner these people have
been cheated and imposed upon by some of the Inhabitants of Florida,
The persons who have been most clamourous about their claims on the
Indians for properety are those who have cheated under false reports,
these people of their slaves who have since gone back to the Indians I
have been adjudicating on these claims for some time almost daily
since my arrival here. The Justice which the Indians are intitled to
they cannot obtain, while they surrender to our citizens the slaves
claimed by them, Their own negros that have been taken from them
are held by white people who refuse to diliver them up—I have felt
asshamed while urgeing the indians to surrender the property they
hold, that I had not power to obtain for them their own rights and
property held by our citizens The government should have their prop-
erty restored to them or pay to the Indians the value of it, To tell one
of these people that he must go to law for his property in our courts
with a white man is net only adding insult to injury I pray sir you will
hear the agent on this subject who is possessed of many facts, highly
deserving the attention of your [MS. torn] partment.

be hereafter explained. It will be remarked that, on examination
of the diagram forwarded you, an offset in the Parallel West, was
made between Ranges 17 and 18, hence the Supposed error in Vouchers

the 2nd inst, that of the 3rd merely enclosed a Statement of Surveys
deficient in Y." Office at that time, which I hope you have been in the
regular receipt of, by every mail from this place.
I informed you in my last letter that, I feeeived would answer
Yours of the 25" Jan’ last" by Succeeding mail, In the performance
of this duty. I have to remark in the beginning, that part of your
letter has given rise to painful feelings, and I sincerely hope, un-
intentional on Your part, -You express regret, that I should proceed
to Contract for Surveying on the presumption that the appropriation
would be made on the estimate forwarded by me; permet me to
remark that I made those Contracts under your reiterated instruc-
tions to have the quantity of land Contracted for and Surveyed within
the year. The fourth paragraph of Your letter is, “I think it necessary
that the Contract should Specify the particular township, and Section
& lines, that the Contractor, is to Survey; and that no Contract
should be entered into with any one individual, for a greater quantity
of Surveying than he Can personlly attend to and execute within the
year.” When Your attention is drawn to the law, forbiding the
Survey of large bodies of poor unsaleable land, added to your Opinion
founded upon my letter to you on that Subject, during the last year,
I do think that you will see how impossible it is for me to designate
the Township and Section lines for each deputy, but I presume when
I shall forwarded hereafter at the Close of the Surveys each duplicate
Contract, with a Settlement Statement of the lines actually run by
each Surveyor, that your wishes will be entirely met.
Permit me now to call your attention to the latter Clause of that
paragraph—And to state emphatically, that I have never given more
than one thousand miles to any one Deputy, and they are bound
under the Solemn obligation of an Oath, to do and perform their
work personally, and the longest limit for performance was nine

of mine to justify a belief that I ever did, or would, deviate from your
instructions on this point, and that by reference to the Attorney
Generals Opinion, (which forms part of your instructions,) in the
case of the late Survy Gen' Rector," this Subject formed part of the
Charges against him, I feel totally at a loss how to account for the
introduction of that Clause in Your letter,-If the amount of Con-
tracts heretofore, is Considered by you too large, I shall be thankful
for you to give me a limit, by which I shall be governed.
The duties incident to this Office Since its Commencement are now
before you, and I hope they will bear the test as well in quantity as
quality, with any other Office in the United States.
I have just learned that the Stationary for my Office, has arrived
at S* Marks, from whence I shall have it Conveyed immediately,
and will forward by next mail the Acc’t with a draft on the Treasury
for the amount, together with my accounts for the Quarter ending

pairs and transportation of the instruments &c. which have arrived,
and the Account had to be returned to Messrs Wilkins & Linton,
being interely informal.
The duties required by the transmission of these instruments shall
be attendid to as soon as Circumstances will Admit.
I deem it necessary to inform you that my Deputy Surveyors
(from information received) will generally have Completed their

extract of a letter from Co." Geo Brook on the present suffering con-
dition of the Florida Indians—That many of the wandering Indians
and particularly those who have established their camps in the
neighbourhood of the Bay of Tampa are in a distressed situation is
very probable, but as their present condition has been ascribed by
you to causes which conflict with a report made by me to your Pred-
ecessor in the Dep" of War," I have to express a wish that the President
of the U. S. would direct a reexamination of the territory allotted
the Indians with a view of ascertaning to his satisfaction its capacity
to sustain them—This examination will be unnecessary, if the objects
now contemplated, that of a removal of the Indians West of the Mis-
sissippi can be effected—On this subject of such deep interest to the
territory of Florida, I had the honor of addressing your predecessor
many years since,” and at the late treaty " some effort would have
been made towards its accomplishment, if it had not been early
discovered that the agitation of the subject at that time would defeat
a hegetiatien negotiation on any points between the parties—The
concentration however which has been effected; the control which
has thereby been acquired and the present condition of the Indians
(if as deplorable as represented) renders it a favourable time to make
the propositions and with great probability of success—If they cannot
however be removed to lands west of the Mississippi the security
and welfare of the territory of Florida, require that they be forced
within the boundaries assigned them by the late Treaty—An Article
of that compact provides for an extension North, if the lands within
the limits defined should be found inadequate to their support, and as
Commissioner for surveying the boundaries. I have expressed the
opinion, after a minute examination, that the country as originally
defined was fully equal to the support of the population to be located
on it—The sufferings of the Indians cannot therefore in my opinion
be justly ascribed “to an ignorance on their part of the nature of the
country to which they consented to migrate or to erroneous informa-
tion on ours as to its fitness, -” but to causes very different, and which
a thorough knowledge and investigation of the whole subject can alone
develop—
The history of the Florida Indians is not involved in the mists of
antiquity, or need we examine old treaties or Spanish policy to ascer-
tain their rights or claims—
The Aborigines of the Country have long since been extirpated;
The Seminoles or natives reduced to a miserable degenerate tribe,

while the disaffected of the 4 Southern Nations have innundated
the territory from the Creek war of 1812 to 1823–; Hostiles acknowl-
edging allegiance to no general government but scattered through
the country under ambitious independent Chieftains—
These were the Indians who were constantly disturbing the tran-
quility of our frontiers; these were the savages who originated the
Seminole conflict, and who being in the absolute possession of the
country despised the power and paid no regard to the authority or
claims of the Spanish government—This description of Indians occu-
pied the most desirable part of Florida and claiming it by conquest
they were only to be treated with on the same principles—Genl
Jackson while Governor of Florida strongly urged the propriety of
their being ordered back to the Country from which they had ab-
sconded, but the objections of the State of Georgia to having a part
of a population returned to it, the whole of which the General Govern-
ment was under obligations to remove induced the policy of concen-
tration within the limits of Florida—
This concentration could only be effected by denying the claim
of the Indians to the country then occupied and asserting the right
and power of the general Government to drive them back to the land
they had fled from, accompanied however with an offer, which was
accepted, of lands in the Peninsula and which should be adequate to
their sustenance—Many of them knew the Country, most of them
had hunted on it, and though unwillingly, all did not ignorantly
emigrate—The supposed incapacity of the country to sustain them
has had very little influence on their present condition and their
sufferings are such as have even afflicted a white population emigrat-
ing in mass and uncontrolled in their operations by prudence or
judgement—In most of the negotiations with the Southern Tribes;
the Indians have been gradually confined to narrower limits; the
titles to the hunting grounds first & principally extinguished, while
few settlements have been disturbed, or those disturbed have invar-
iably bore but an inconsiderable proportion to those permitted to be
retained—Hence the migrating Indians besides their annuities and
the value for their improvements received, were assisted by their
undisturbed Bretheren untill they could make new improvements &
bring into cultivation new lands—The Florida Indians on the contrary
migrated in mass, abandoned villages and farms which many years
labor had improved, and went to a new Country—Delayed in their
removal 4 or 5 months longer than contemplated by the treaty,
they had little time to open lands, or make crops, while exhausting
the subsistence allowed them the first year, and in some cases relying
on erroneous impressions it was to be repeated for a second, they are
left in the condition reported by Co' Brook—Disconted as they may

be, suffering as they probably do, the time is propitious for a removal
West of the Mississippi, but if they are indisposed to yield voluntarily
to Such an arrangement, and the Administration unwilling to enforce
it by authority, they will be compelled, it is hoped, to concentrate
within the limits allotted them—I believe those surveyed and marked
by me equal to their support, if extended as recommended by the
Governor to embrace the Big Swamp more than Sufficient & I have so
reported to the Dept over which you preside—A reexamination can
alone determine the fact; and an investigation into all the trans-
actions connected with the negotiation and execution of the Treaty
so far as I have had any agency in either, would be gratifying to my
feelings, and would be even insisted on as an act of justice, if the
Executive has imbibed any unfavourable impressions from the
officious information which has been given to your department—
You will excuse my trespassing on your patience by these lengthy
details—But it is due to my own character to place the facts con-
nected with this subject before you, and to court further investigation
on points on which I feel little hesitation in saying you have been
illy informed—

The undersigned old inhabitants of Pensacola in the Territory of
Florida with all due respect represent. That it has reached their
attention that Congress proposes to make a change in the duties of
marshals and sheriffs of this Territory, which bill gives to the marshall
the exclusive functions of official executive in the Superior Courts;

grievous but oppressive to the inhabitants of said Territory, and
particularly to those in the region where the undersigned reside they
pray to your honorable Body that it will find it convenient not to
adopt it, pointing out in their support that in 1823 the legislative
council of the Territory, appointed the said marshalls executive offi-
cials of the above mentioned Superior Courts in the same terms
that are used in the law or bill that is now before your Honorable
Body but in 1824 this same law was repealed as a result of the many
supplications and petitions sent to the said Council from the different
counties of this Territory,” which petitions according to the belief
of the undersigned expressed the desire of the people of the Territory—
Being above all very evident that the placing of this duty in the
executive official of the Superior Court bestows the power of exer-
cising frequent tyranny over the people, and of confusing the course
of justice, all of which would be without recourse if our applications
to Congress were in vain; and inasmuch as the appointment of county
officials has been until now well taken care of to the satisfaction of the
inhabitants by his Excellency the Governor, neither is there any
doubt in exacting cases he would give the same favorable attention
in order to expedite them when requisite; presently they prefer that
the sheriff's responsibility be subject to the people—than without it.
The undersigned humbly ask of your Honorable Body that in
case it has already passed the bill that it be reconsidered, and to
delete from it that part which concerns the sheriff or at least except
from its operation the County of Escambia where the undersigned
live: [This is] The only benefaction that the old Spanish inhabitants
have asked for up to the present and do not doubt that they will
merit the favorable action of your honorable body.

JOHN W. SIMONTON TO SAMUEL SMITH
[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:ALSl
WASHINGTON 43 February 3 April 1826.
SIR By a provision of the 10" section of an Act “entitled an Act
to provide for the collection of Duties on Imports & Tonnage in
Florida and for other purposes” Approved the 7" of May 1822.”
You will perceive that foreign goods, Wares & Merchandise cannot
be exported from any port of Florida for the benefit of drawback,
“unless the same shall have been imported directly into the said Port
from a foreign Port or place”
I cannot see any just reasons for placing the Ports of Florida under
those peculiar restrictions, from which Ports of the United States are
exempted—these restrictions operate with extreme severity against
the Ports of Pensacola & Key West, which from their local positions,
are better adapted for an advantageous trade with the Island of Cuba
and the ports of Mexico, than any other ports within the Sovereignty
of the United States, and they would, in my opinion, enjoy a large
portion of the trade of those countries, provided these restrictions
were removed—As the law now stands goods imported into Key
West direct from a foreign Port, can be reshipped with debenture, but
if transhipped from New York to Key West this priviledge is denied.
It cannot surely be considered adviseable in wise legislation to retain
a Statute which merely gives trouble to the Merchant, but which can
be so easily evaded—for example, goods are shipped from New York
for Bermuda, the drawback forthwith attaches, and the debenture
becomes effectual.—These goods then can be again reshipped and
arriving, would as coming direct from a foreign Port be entitled to
debenture, when reexported from Key West, and the Merchants in
their trade to the Islands and to the Maine, would attain all the
benifits they desire, Thus you see the law can be most easily evaded,
with this only inconvenience, that a Shipment from Bermuda would
impose some additional trouble and expense beyond what would be
* Not found. On Mar. 31, 1833, Robert Mitchell, the Collector, furnished the

incurred if drawbacks were admitted on shipments made from Ports
or places in the United States,—Any increased expense that can be
avoided, should be avoided, because every increase of it will have a
tendency to place us on terms of less fair competition with the Mer-
chants resident at New Providence.—
The advantages to be derived from this trade is of more importance
than one who has not reflected upon the subject, might at first con-
ceive;—The Contiguity of Key West to Cuba & the Ports of Mexico,
gives it in point of situation a decided Superiority over Ports of the
U States for a trade with those Countries. The Spanish vessels are
in the habit of bringing Specie, cochineal, Hides, Sugar Coffee &c.
and in exchange require large and various Supplies of Articles, which
they have been in the habit of procuring heretofore at New Providence
and at Jamaica.—So important have the British Government con-
sidered this Commerce that for the last twenty years, pre-Port
licences have been extended to the Spanish traders, by which they
are exempt from all and every sort of Port charges.—But the prox-
imity of Key West which is only about eighty miles from Cuba, a
distance that can always be run in one night, induces those traders
to prefer a commerce with it.—The passage is so short and so safe,
and withal, every thing of risk from Privateers and Pirates, being
saved they will always prefer it, while they can be supplied with
Articles suited to their purpose. This though, cannot be the case
uniess the priviledge of drawback is allowed; for at present, owing to
the limited state of Capital and the facilities aforded at our home
Markets, importations direct from Europe do not take place; the
consequence is that unless Congress grant, the relief sought for, a
great portion of the Spanish trade now so valuable to the commerce
and Navigation of the US must continue to go to the Ports of Jamaica
& New Providence.
It has been urged that the arrangement sought to be obtained
would increase the chances to fraud upon the Revenue; & that an
illicit trade from Key West to the United States might be the con-
sequence.—This certainly is a far fetched suggestion, and applies in
point of probability no more to that, than it would to any other Port
or place in the country.—The same thing might be imputed to ship-
ments for drawback from New York, Boston, Philad" or Baltimore
and with much greater seeming plausibility; because Key West being
contiguous to the Main land in Florida where the population is few &
scattered, precludes every of inducement or attempt at fraud; persons
being never disposed to place property, where there are none to con-
sume and purchase it.—But besides this an ample & Sufficient answer
to this objection is, that the supposition of frauds of this character
goes to break down the whole doctrine and system of Debenture, in

as much as its feasibility from any other Port is just as great as it
could be from Key West.

SIR, Your letter of 4* Jan' last "with a Copy of the Memorial of
Sundry Citizens of Florida was received by me lately at the Florida
Agency and the causes of complaint have been promptly enquired
into. I gave notice to the Citizens of Alachua, and had the same
posted up in Six places the most Public in the County, and on the day
appointed, a great number of the Citizens, many of whom Signed the
memorial attended, I read to them a copy of the memorial and in-
formed the Citizens that I had been directed to enquire into the
causes of Complaint and I was then ready to receive any testimony
that would be offered in support of the charges contained in the me-
morial. I have now the Honor to transmit you a copy of the notice,
with the Several Depositions taken in pursuance of the Same to-
gether with the Depositions of John. Y. Warfield and James Hardage,"
which were previously taken at the Agency.

From all that I have been able to understand, it is clear to me, that
the Inhabitants of Alachua were strongly impressed with the belief
that the Agent had the right to call out Military force to execute his
orders at any time and that it was owing entirely to his neglect that
this was not done. I am convinced that the Agent exerted all his
influence and power to controle the Indians and did perform as much
as any other man unbacked by a competent force could have accom-
plished. I do not hesitate a moment in stating that the whole
Indian Nation is under more complete controle, and order than any
other nation of Indians that can be found in the limits of the United
States, who have so recently come under our management. The
Mickkeesukee, tribe I must except from this general remark: they
are and have ever been the most violent and lawless Indians in all the
South. They have Set their own Chiefs at defiance, and have aban-
doned their limits, roving among the white inhabitants killing their
hogs and cattle, and pillaging their plantations. There is about 200
of these Indians that never can be managed but by force. Three
times have they attempted to put to death their head Chief because
he has endeavoured to restrain their excesses.
All the Chiefs in open Council have denounced them, and have
assured me that if the Government, will afford them assistance that
they will punish these outlaws, of their nation and bring them into
their boundary. I have Seen many of them on the Suwannee and
Ocilla Rivers; they are actually raising Crops in the neighbourhood
of the Whites; altho I furnished I furnished them with provisions two
months Since, when they all promised immediately to go into the
boundary. Not one has gone nor will they move unless compelled.
I have been upwards of two months in the woods, regulating and
bringing the Indians to order, and have completely Succeeded except
with the Mickkeesukee tribe.
The inhabitants are greatly exasperated at the injuries they have
Sustained from this tribe and the worse consequences may be ex-
pected. I acknowledge I can do nothing more. without force—no
confidence can be placed in this tribe, and the orderly Indians com-
plain as much of them as the Whites. they have most wantonly killed
up the Cattle and hogs of the Nation, and will continue to do So. In
fact their own people has Suffered as much from their depredations
as our Citizens. If the Department is Satisfied that the Agent has
discharged his duties faithfully as I believe he has, it will be only
rendering him justice to make his acquital, as public as the charges
which have been preffered against him."
I am Respectfully your obt Sevt

you propose of continuing on the old Kings road, as far as it was in
the direction of that which you are required to open, is approved.
Colonel Brooke will receive instructions to continue the road from

Mayors Office CITY OF STAUGUSTINE Apr 5* 1826
SIR. The City Council have determined after mature deliberation
and examination of the Subject that the most eligible point on the
St. Sebastian River for the termination of the Tallahassee road under
present circumstances is at Wiel's Ferry nearly opposite the Western
end of Bridge Street, (a few rods north of the temporary foot Bridge
built by Mr. Wiel) extending down to the most eastwardly part of the
marsh so as to enable the Ferry Boat to land passangers or Horses on
the causeway at any time of tide.
This place appears from an examinations of a map made, from
actual Survey, in the year 1793. to have been at that time used as a
crossing place. Although the Island may possibly have increased or
diminishd in the size [sin]ce that time it is intended to leave it to the
South; but it is desirable [th]at the Ferry should pass as near to the
North end of it as possible.
By a resolution of the Council passed this day I am directed to
communicate the above to you, and to request that you will inform
me of your arrival at the marsh on the opposite side when a member
of the Council or my self will attend and give any additional informa-
tion which may be required: As to the Flat or Ferry Boat it is con-
sidered indispensably necessary as there is no certainty of the time
when the Bridge will be completed."

it an important point gained, could the chiefs be induced to send out

WASHINGTON April 8" 1826
SIR In reply to the inquiries you did me the honor to make in
regard to the necessity of a speedy settlement of the Land claims in
Florida I do not hesitate to say, that in my opinion all the claims over
the Jurisdiction of the Commissioners should be refered to the Judiciary
of the Territory for decision. The claimants are forced every year to
make sales of some part of their lands and in proportion to the
uncertainty of the title a corresponding dimunition of price which
multiplies the number of petitioners to the next Congress, prevents
the United States from selling at a fair price, and consequently
retards population; every delay in the adjustment of land claims is
injurious to the claimants and to the Government In East Florida
there are numerous large claims on which reports have been made and
which are now before Congress and unless they adopt some satisfactory
mode of ascertaining their validity by Courts or Committees the
Country will be greatly retarded in its progress, honest claimants
materially injured and dishonest ones benefitted by selling imperfect
and invalid titles. In relation to the Claim of John Forbes & Co. I
have to observe the reasons for a speedy settlement of that, derive

Government in the centre of the Territory, and it will be of the

will enable the claimants to institute proceedings to have it judicially

EDGAR MACON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:ALS]
[April 8, 1826]
THE HON HENRY CLAY Secretary of State
SIR, The record of a proceeding, which was a rule of court made at
the November Term of the Superiour court of E. Fa. 1825, Baade
against me fer to shew cause why I should not be dismissed from the
bar of said court as an attorney and counsellor at Law, which was
perferred by Judge Smith who then presided, though upon the com-
plaint of no individual whatever, and sustained chiefly upon his own
affidavits, having been submitted & forwarded to your department by
Judge Smith, I beg the privilege of urging a further defence, as the
question now stands whether I am to be dismissed as an officer of
government, from any thing that is alleged or proved by the record—I
more earnestly ask this privilege as much, that I now state, would
have been tantamount to a contempt of court had it been used or
applied when Judge Smith himself presided—as the Judge—though I
contend that my answer exhibited in court was a complete & sufficient
defence to have exonerated me from any charge of improper conduct
as an attorney or man. Believing that the privilege I ask will be
extended and a more patient and less prejudiced hearing now given
me I proceed to reply to the charges as exhibited—
The first charge is one that I cannot conceive how an attorney can
be guilty of—he is not bound by his oath to conceal any secret of a
Jury for none so far as I have been acquainted with him have ever
been confided to him, and though in some courts he may be allowed to
appear before them to present them bills of indictment or when sent
for, to instruct them on points of Law, as is the case and practilee] in
E. Florida, yet he is never, even there, allowed to be a witness of any
their deliberations, When a jury has made a presentment in court,
it is a matter of publicity & any one is at liberty to speak of it, the
same must have been known to the court & to every other person

F L Q R J D A 7" E R R H TO R Y 507
in Florida, yet eighteen months after the conversation between
Col Humpheys and Judge Smith, my speaking of that which was
known to all, is deemed an offence. I called on to answer for it, an
affidavit of Judge Smith stating what he had heard is made evidence
against me, which affidavit is not corroborated by the evidence of
Col. Humphreys, with from whom it is stated that Judge Smith
derives his information—
To the second charge I must repeat that the court at the May Term
1824, was opened both as a U States court & a territorial court, that
the grand Jury when impannelled Sworn & charged, were considered
and treated as one and the same during the time they were in session
that the session lasted from the 3" till the 18" of May, that my attend-
ance on behalf of the U. States during the whole of the session was
indispensably necessary, as in that time any offence against the laws
of the U.S. might be enquired into by the Jury, and that consequently
I was entitled to demand & receive the legal allowance—So far as I
have been able to learn it has been and still is the practice of all U. S.
Attys throughout the States to charge for each day of a term, whether
their be public business or not, proceeding upon the principle that
their services may be required, Here it is evident that I wished to
receive compensation for such time only as when they appeared in
court— and when it is considered that the G. Juries of the Superiour
court of E. Fa adjourn and sit at their pleasure & a mistake of two days
might easily be made, Mr. Gould who on this occasion volunteered
his affidavit states that the Jury appeared in court seven days—If
this charge made by me was improper why was I not notified of it at
the time and why was it permitted to pass unnoticed for two years—
It ought to be remembered that it was presented, as I know it must
be—to the court for its sanction—how then could I be so simple as
attempt to commit & practice a fraud that insured from itself immedi-
ate detection—In my construction of the Laws on this subject I
might have been in error though I still believe I was not, the Judge
must have so considered or why was my intentions called in question
at this remote period—and the public suffered to retain an officer so
unworthy his trust, for two years—I may be pardoned for also remark-
ing that in each of the territories and especially in Florida it was
supposed by all officers till September 1824, that the territorial busi-
ness was to be considered as U. S. business and they charged accord-
ingly as will appear by a reference to the Comptrollers office-
In answer to the third charge I say that no contempt or disrespect
on my part was intended to be offered to Judge Smith I had been
requested by the Collector of Key West to file a libel against a bag
of Coffee he had seized for a breach of the Revenue Laws, at first
I resolved in consequence of the remote distance of Key West the

difficulty of communicating there and the enormous expence of the
prosecution & the insignificance] of the amount of property to
decline a prosecution but on the representation that such a course in
me, might] be construed & called a neglect of duty & understanding
that the Marshal of the district was about to visit Key West on
other business, I filed a libel against the coffee, and on Saturday the
ninth of April sent the same together with a polite & very respectful
note to Judge Smith begging him to make the necessary order of
monition &c. The libel and note was placed in the hands of one
Dennis, (who though unhappily addicted to intemperance, yet when
sober is faithful & respectful in his deportment, had been as then was
retained by me as a servant to attend about my office and was fre-
quently employed for such purposes by the gentlemen of the place,
and then as he seemed to me and as I believed; & was perfectly
sober, who in a short time returned and said he delivered the papers
which I expected he would have brought back, nevertheless I deter-
mined to call for them but before I could do so the marshal had left
the place unexpectedly to me on the evening ef after the morning on
which I had sent the libel, when for reasons before alleged I concluded
to abandon the matter—Judge Smith says that I sent the libel to
him on the 10" I am positive I did not & that it was on the ninth,
the tenth was Sunday as appears from the Almanac which shews
that the Judge Haight may at times be mistaken in his recollections
or at times commit a blunder—I am certain likewise that it not
necessary for me in this case to appear before the Judge in proper
person as he contends the business could be transacted by note & if
the one sent on this occasion was at all improper why was it not
exhibited—for it seems that every line I ever wrote has been carefully
preserved—As it regards my saying that Judge Smith did not seem
disposed to transact business with me in the same manner as with
other persehs members of the bar, it was induced by a representation
to me that Judge Smith had contemptuously observed that the said
Dennis had been associated my partner but that he (Judge Smith)
would not admit him to the bar with other such provoking expressions;
which caused me to observe as much as I have admitted. It was
natural that I should think so and the numerous circumstances of
the Judges avowed hostility his insulting demeanour to me in the
streets his refusing to give me such returns of politeness as are usual
when gentlemen meet the constant abusive language he often applied
when speaking of me, on this occasion might have been an apology
for my more harsh indignations, but nothing of the kind is expressed,
and all that can be shewn is that when I supposed myself aggrieved,
I made to a confidential friend a mild complaint, a right that is
scarce denied to the meanest slave in the most arbitary government—


## p. 509 (#527) ############################################

F L Q R J D A 7" E. R. R. I T' O R Y 509
To the 4" charge I observe that on the subject of Judge Smith
having advised the course of proceeding in the Case of Tattnal &
Shearman I never spoke of it as directly within my own knowledge.
this the testimony of Rodman & Drysdale clearly shews, however
the latter in his testimony may have equivocated, even had I have
done so, I was excusable—for Major Clarke the very intimate friend
of Judge Smith who was the principal council of Tattnal and who
alone visited the office of the Judge previous to the issuing of the
attachment in the case, ef returned and informed Col. Tattnal in my
presence, that he, Col Tattnal had no cause to hesitate or doubt,
for that he Major Clarke had been instructed by Judge Smith, how
he should proceed and produced as an evidence of his statement
Kerbys reports" whieh containing a case directly in point which he
said had been furnished by Judge Smith who had the only copy in
Fa—this statement Major Clarke frequently made both before and
after the quashing of the attachment as appears by the certificates of
Col. Tattnal & Capn Lancaster new herewith accompaning & marked
exhibits A & B and Judge Smith in delivering his opinion on the case
rather corroborated Major Clarke's statement (vide Lancaster certifi-
cate). No contradiction of Major C. epimień statement is made till
Judge S. went to St Marys and procured Major C's own statement
and affidavit proving him himself to be regardless of truth (this
affidavit of Major Clarke is by no means satisfactory however—)
when some the is made, when & understanding that Mr Drysdale to
whom in the heat anxiety of argument & discussion I had mentioned
my confidence of success stating the reasons of Hay eenfidehee why
I felt so, and whose Haiserable debasement situation in society I was
willing to commisserate, felt some unpleasantness in being called on
as a witness in the business, to relieve him from his embarrassment,
I told him I had said that Judge Smith did in this matter give in-
struction to Col. Tattnal's Lawyer, I may have said that he did, yet
even Mr Drysdale admits that I said I was ready to surrender my the
name of my author and that if Major Clarke denied having said so
that I would expose him &c, thus clearly shewing that I did not
speak of my own knowledge—yet this most technical reasoning is
resorted to, to bring me in into the definition of a contempt—or
malpractice
The fifth charge needs no comment or reply as Judge Smith himself
there acquits me, tho’ I am surprized that if I made the motion in
court stated, that there is no appearance of it on record where it

should have been placed—nor could any of the numerous barremember
that I had made such a motion
The sixth charge and the seventh may be considered together
they are so intimately connected that they constitute one and the
same act—That there is any evidence to prove that I had any agency
whatever in making the alteration in the execution in the case of the
U. S. vs Perpall or that the same was made else where than in the
clerks office where it could be legally and properly done it has not
yet been exhibited, the alteration is made in such a manner that it
is evident no concealment was intended, Mr. Tingle the clerk says
that he is not positive that the alteration was not made by him, and
but thinks that it was made by Mr. Wilson who at that time wrote
in the office more especially as he is confident that the alteration in
the execution book was in his opinion, formed from an acquaintance
with Mr Wilson's hand writing, made by Mr Wilson if then Mr.
Wilson made one alteration the conclusion is irresistable, that the
other must have been made by him also-The execution after altered
conforms to my written memorandum left in the Clks office directing
the execution to be issued, which Mr Tingle says he did not read
when he wrote the execution which was delivered to Mr Wilson to
record, Is it not then a fair presumption that seeing the execution did
not correspond with my memorandum that he Mr Wilson made the
alteration that they might correspond, especially as he made the
alteration in the execution book which is nothing but a brief history
of the executions issued—the court dwells much however on the cir-
cumstance that no alteration is made in the original judgment of the
case, where five dollars, instead of fifteen is entered as the costs of
the suit, this is an evidence that I could have had no agency in the
alteration for certainly I was not blind as to attempt a fraud which
I did not complete, or that I would thus foolishly expose the execution
to be quashed whenever the opposite party might be disposed to do
so, it was an oversight of Mr. Wilson a young lawyer indifferently
acquainted with the rules of the office and its routine of business as
is well known. In regard to my application to the Judge, it was
made tader for a fee of $20 and not for ten dollars, not by & under
the section of the law the ten dollars was received, but under the very
section ef the law that Judge Smith considered himself entitled to
receive & demand fees—as is expressed in the application and I deny
that I ever had any notice direct or indirect of the Judge refusing to
grant my motion, if I had why was this application retained by the
Judge & not returned to me or the office—or why is this matter which
it would seem has been known to the court Perhaitted since December
1824 permitted to remain unnoticed till now when circumstances must
be forgotten, & not brought up untill a short time after the death of

Mr Wilson by whom alone the manner of the alteration could be
proved—The fee charged in this case I was entitled to if not, the
laborious duties of the office of U.S. Atty had to be performed without
any compensation or reward, and the decission of the court in other
cases confirmed the my construction of the law—Mr Perpall was the
last person I wished or desired to injure or deprive unjustly of a cent,
so far from pressing him in the suits then against him, I was anxious
to extend to him every indulgence consistent with duty and my
situation and exhibits C & D "shew that towards him I could not be
guilty of any thing like extortion—
I cannot conclude without complaining of the manner in which the
whole of the proceedings contained in the copy of the record was con-
ducted, had an attorney of the court at the suggestion or the complaint
of an individual have preferred charges against me as attorney, in the
usual way nothing could be said, but no complaint is made no attorney
steps forward to prosecute—Yet the Judge of the court with whom
and myself there long had been a private & personal ahinaesity
difference, who made it his habit both in public and private to insult
me by the most bitter calumniations, against whom I had been goaded
under the excitement of such impropriety on his part to say that I
must complain to my government, makes it his duty business to
collect testimony and affidavits from persons over whom he had the
greatest ascendancy & control to justify and colour the charges he
himself was about to make thus prejudging the merits of a case which
he himself must decide, and further depriving me of a fair trial by
superintending the examination of the witnesses examined in court,
and by making his own statements evidence in the court where he
presided, and even by sending for the witnesses summoned by me to
his chamber to enquire what they knew of the case and when told,

satisfied with a verdict pronounced under such circumstances, especi-
ally when by the direction of the court the sixth & seventh charges
were referred & submitted to the grand Jury of the country who on
their oaths could not say I was guilty although the Judge himself
descended from his bench and appeared before them as a witness—
Had my means been stinted and inadequate to my support, had I
been pecunious in my disposition, had my character as a Lawyer & a
gentleman ever been called in question, had I ever been guilty or
charged with treating with disrespect any tribunal before which I
appeared in my professional character, then with some plausibility
might I be accused of the petty frauds, if frauds they be, of the

malpractices and contempts &c, alleged against me, but I defy any
man to say I have defrauded him of a cent or in my transactions with
him have dealt regidly, I also challenge my enemies and every man
has them, to say that they have seen me when in court treat and
behave other than with the greatest decency & respect and though at
times, I have differed in opinion with the Judge, (yet on my part
it was an honest error if I committed one) it was done with perfect
decorum and proper deference and the testimonies of distinguished
gentlemen who have known me from infancy and associated with me
as a Lawyer shew that my standing as such and as a gentlemen has
hither to never been impeached (see exhibits F. G. H. I & K), " and
the charges now brought forward if stripped & divested of their
verbage amount in themselves to nothing, neither have they been
sustained, unless by resorting to a construction & principle that would
overthrow the very foundation of our liberties, viz, that every thing
is to be taken in the worst eet stra and most constrained and aggre-
vated sence & construction against the accused—
If in submitting the above I have betrayed any improper warmth
of feeling, if any harsh expression has escaped me, I beg that it will
not be ascribed to any motive of impropriety, that it will be rather
attributed to the sense of indignation natural to the occasion when we
believe that we have been dealt with and treated with injustice, which
if it cannot be excused will at least be pardoned when the peculiarly
aggrivated circumstances of the my case is considered—and the
mean[s] that have been resorted to, to effect my ruin. The above is

of the decision of Judge Smith, in the case of Hamiltons adm" vs
Shearman, so far as the same seemed to respond, to a statement
made to me by Arch" Clarke Esq. of St Marys in Ge"; as well also
"Enclosures F, G, H, I, and K are present but they are omitted from this

as to say what Maj Clarke had said to me; in relation to the same
subject; I have to State
After the argument in the case, I saw Maj Clarke who had appeared
in opposition to the interests of Shearman, which I in part, repre-
sented: And I asked him jocularly, how he thought the decision would
be: He replied to me, that he had no doubt of success; altho' I had
made a long speech which had fatigued the Judge very much; but he
said that all the steps which had been taken in the case, had been
advised by the Judge, and he had no doubt he would and must
sustain the advice which he had himself given
When the Judge delivered his opinion in this case, I was in Court;
and on Account of the statement made to me by Maj" Clarke, as
well as for other reasons I was particularly attentive, to what he said:
I think the Judge did say; He had been of a different opinion from
that which he then delivered, as the opinion of the Court, but from
the arguments made, and authorities furnished in this case, he had
changed his opinion; expressing at the same time a decided conviction
on his part, that in all cases; it was best and most proper that a Judge
should never give any opinion upon matters of law, except when they
were properly before him for adjudication
It is proper for me to say, this statement is made entirely from
recollection, for I took no notes of the conversation, or of the decision
which I have here adverted to—

attachment was applied for on the part of the plaintiff):—or my
impressions, as made upon my mind by the statements of one of my
counsel, Maj. Clark, in relation to such an expression of opinion,
I have to remark, that, with myself personally, no conversation, in
regard to the case alluded to, ever took place on the part of Judge

Smith, before the granting of the attachment, or, within my recollec-
tion, after it was dissolved, except what few words may have passed
in Judge Smith's office & which merely related to the form of proceed-
ling.
The impressions, however, made upon my mind from repeated
conversations had with my counsel, Maj Clark, were, that Judge
Smith had declared, upon being consulted, that I could proceed in
Florida as an administrator under letters of administration taken out
in Georgia.—
A further impression left upon my mind (though indistinctly) is,
that, subsequently to the expression of an adverse opinion in the case,
under which opinion the attachment had been dissolved, Maj C.
stated to me that the Judge felt regret at my having been led into
error; but that, upon the first presentation of the subject to him, he
was of the opinion I could proceed, as at first contemplated by my
Counsel, but that the arguments of counsel, & a thorough examination
of the matter had produced a change in his view of it, -that the
opinion he had, at first, expressed was in conformity with the rule
prevailing in Connecticut, during the period of his practice in that
State.
I have also to state that M Macon, from the first, expressed a
difference of opinion as to the mode to be adopted by me, but, con-
sidering Maj Clark as the Senior Counsel, he gave me notice that
he should yield to him the entire management of the case.—
Before closeing this statement it is proper that I should remark,
as my impressions are so variant from the affidavit of Maj Clark,
that my situation, at the time of receiving them, (being extremely
indisposed) may have made me less attentive to the exact meaning
of Maj Clark's expressions.—With Maj Clark I have been long in
habits of intimacy, & the most perfect mutual confidence has existed
between us.—
I have, however, felt it my duty to state every impression upon
my mind.—
With Mr Macon I had several conversations, and, a few as I recol-
lect, his impressions from the conversations of Maj" Clark, seemed
to be similar to my own.—

Edgar Macon to Stephen Pleasonton
STAUGUSTINE, March 8th 1824.
Copy.
SIR, Agreeable to your instructions, I presented the bond of G. W.
Perpall for $1060 (payable on the 1* August last past and assigned
to the United States by Charles Gobert Esq:) to Mr Perpall for pay-
ment, and to my disappointment he informed me that it was impos-
sible for him to honour it instantly, not having calculated that it
would be dishonoured in New York. The course in this event, to be
pursued by me, is, I presume to institute a suit upon the bond im-
mediately, this I shall do, but permit me to suggest that it would be
an act of great charity in the Treasury, to allow M* Perpall some
further indulgence; this Gentleman manifests every disposition and
evinces the most honourable inclination to discharge his obligation,
and tenders to the United States ample Security by liens upon real
and city property, for the whole debt of $3360, provided he is not
coerced at present. The situation of Florida, as it respects its pe-
cuniary state, is more deplorable than you can conceive, there is
scarcely an individual in the Territory, that is not oppressed with
debt, and the immense number of executions that must be enforced
in a few weeks, announce our embarassments and our inability to
discharge them. Should M. Perpall in this case, be carried into
Court, and the debt be collected by process of law, I speak within
the bounds of reason and upon my reputation, when I state, that I
believe it will take property of the value of four times the debt, to
satisfy it. M. Perpall has other claims upon the Treasury to induce
that Department to be somewhat liberal, he has never received any
Consideration for the bonds, (now in my hands for collection,) but
was induced to sign them by the false representations and earnest
solicitations of M* Gobert, (whose character you may be acquainted
with,) who was then indebted to the United States and had no pros-
pect of extricating himself but by involving an innocent person,
which he has effectually done, and that person now stands accountable
for a debt, that was incurred by a generous and benevolent desire to
relieve the distresses of an acquaintance. M. Perpall assures, and
from his character, I believe he would scorn to make a false repre-
sentation or assurance, that should he be indulged he will make every
effort to discharge this debt as soon as it could be enforced by law,
and I hope and believe that he will be able to do this. Until I hear
from you my conduct will be regulated strictly by the law; In your
next communication I will be glad to be informed, whether the money

I. S. Streeter Sheriff of the County of St Johns, do hereby certify
that some time in the Month of November Last past, I was sent for
by the Honorable Jos. L. Smith, (Judge of the superior Court for
the District of East Florida,) to call at his office. I went amediately
to the Office of the Judge Smith; on being seated, the Judge enquired
of me, what would be the nature of the my testimony, in favour of
Edgar Macon Esqr. District Attarney, as he had ben informed that
I had ben subpaenyed as a witness, by Mr Macon—I informed the
Judge, that, I knew of nothing respecting which I could testify,
except, some remarks which had, in the Month of June previous,
ben made to me by Archabald Clarke Esqr. an Attorney at Law,
respecting, the said Judge Smith,s giving his opinion upon the validity
and propriety of an attachment suit, which was about to be com-
mensed by Co' Tatnall against one Edward Shearman. The Judge
took some pains to convence me, that I must have misunderstood
Mr. Clarke,s remarks, as Mr Clarke never intended to convey the
Ideas which had ben impressed upon my mind; but he could not
convince me, as I was confident in my views of Mr Clarks meaning
& certain as to his remarks. This conversation took place about 10
Oclock A. M. Amediately after which, the Judge went to the Court
House, and after the Court was opened I was called up and Sworn
by the Clerk, but, the Judge thought, that my testimony, would be
irrelevant and consequently would not allow me to procede Some
three or four days after, I was again called up, and was permitted by
the Judge to give my Testimony The testimony above alluded to,

SIR On the 24" of March I, by order of the Committee on the

I am Induced to believe from the punctual manner you have answered
all Calls that you have either mislaid the Letter, or never received it
or we Should have had your reply before now—
(Copy)
The Committee on the Public Lands have this morning had before
them the Subject of authorising the boundary line between the State of
Georgia and the Territory of Florida to be run—
The 2" and 3* Sections of the Treaty between us and Spain of the
27* of october 1795 provides for fixing this boundary and the manner
in which it Shall be run designated and ascertained."
In examining the documents in this Case we find that the Junction
of Flint River with the Chatahouche River is one point, and the head
of the St Marys River the other—We find that a Monument was
discovered by Ellicott * at the head of the St Marys River, and
this is assumed as the point in that quarter—
The Committee have instructed me to ask of you information as
follows—
1 If any Line was ever run by the Joint authorities of Spain and US
under the third article of the treaty?
2 If not run, was the Monument fixed on and Erected agreed on
by the United Authorities of Spain and us as the head of St

SIR, I have this moment received your letter of the 10th inst.
covering a copy of your letter to me of the 24th of March,” the
original of which was never received.
In reply to your Several queries, I have to state that the line of
demarcation between the United States and Spain was run under the
directions of Commissioners appointed by the respective Govern-
ments, M Ellicot on the part of the United States, and M. Minor *
on the part of Spain, who made a joint report.” The line was run
* On Mar. 15, 1826, the President submitted to the Senate and the House of
Representatives documents concerning the running of the Georgia-Florida
boundary (NA, HF, Orig. Mess. Pres., 19 Cong., 1 sess.; printed, H. Doc. 133,
19 Cong., 1 sess., and S. Misc. Doc. 25, 33 Cong., 2 sess.). The documents
included a letter from Governor Troup, of Georgia, to the President, Apr. 13,
1825, transmitting a resolution of the legislature of Georgia, Nov. 13, 1824, and
requesting that measures be taken to establish the boundary line. In the same
place is the answer of the Secretary of War to Troup, Apr. 26, 1825, to the effect
that a law authorizing the appointment of commissioners and an appropriation
would have to be obtained. With respect to Ellicott, see Terr. Papers (Miss.), V,
3–8, 131-132.

and marked from the termination of the 31 degree of Latitude on the
Mississippi to the Chatahoochie, and from thence down to the junction
of Flint River, at which point the further progress of the Commis-
sioners was arrested by the appearance of Indian hostilities—The
Commissioners thence proceeded to the mouth of the St. Mary's
river and ascended that River to the edge of the Okefonoke Swamp,
where they erected a monument, and decided that the head of the St.
Mary’s river, from which a line should be run to the junction of Flint
river should be a point 640 poles in a direction N. E. from the Monu-
ment erected by them, provided a line from that point should run at
least one mile North of the Monument—I therefore consider this
point as established under the treaty, and all that is now to be done
is to run a line from such point to the junction of Flint river under the
Superintendence of the United States and Georgia
The Surveyor of Florida has run a line from the monument erected
by the Commissioners at the edge of the Swamp to Flint river to
which the Surveys of the Public Lands in Florida have been extended,
but the Sales of the Land have been restricted, so as not to extend to
such line for the present. The report of the Commissioners will, I
presume be found in the Department of State"—I am &c—

At the instance of the members from Georgia there is a bill now
before Congress, providing for the running of the boundary line of
that State and Florida." I enclose for your information a copy of a
letter addressed to the Hon: J: Scott, C. C. on P. Lands, on the
subject.”
I observe that the Surveyors of other Land Districts, have limited
their contracts within ten complete Townships to each Deputy
which I should think as much as one individual ought to have where
there is much competition between competent Surveyors, but there
are so many considerations bearing on the subject of which the
Surveyor himself is the most competent and responsible judge that
the amount of the Contract within the capacity of each individual to
execute, must be left to his discretion "

I found a ship and Schooner here from New Orleans, which had

to bring those with the officers and men that are at Barrataria. It
is the quickest way in which they can be transported, and the expense
will not be great.
I shall direct the commanding officer to be careful in evacuating

nor any abuse whatever committed.

An add mail from Pensacola to either point of junction with the
Montgomery & Mobile route, is found to require too great an expense.
The only facility which at present it is found practicable to give to
the Correspondence of Pensacola, is to expedite their Eastern inter-
course, by transferring the point of departure for the Pensacola
mail from Claiborne to Burnt Corn. Orders to that effect are accord-
* Other letters from Warrington written at Pensacola are to be found in the
same source as this one. In another letter of April 27, he reported that the water
over the bar at Pensacola was sometimes too shallow to admit vessels drawing
more than 19 feet. The arrival of Warrington marked the establishment of the
Pensacola Navy Yard, which was occupied continuously thereafter until its
seizure by the Confederates in Jan. 1861. The yard was burned upon their
withdrawal in May, 1862, and practically all the records prior to that date were
probably destroyed at that time. Much information relative to the activities
of the yard during the territorial period can be derived, however, from the records
of the Navy Department.

W. H. HUNT P. M. Pensacola F.
The policy of the P. O. law requires that Coasting Vessels of every
description should deliver their letters into the P. O. but for such as
are not required by their circumstances “to report or make entry”
at the Custom house, no means of coercion or punishment are pro-
vided.” For them, the inducem" of a Con’, by which they will be
entitled to recieve 3 cents for each letter so delivered, is thought
Sufficient & having made a Con" with one, others will probably
follow the example. If you have any S. Boats plying in the waters
Coastwise to Pensacola, the Course of their navigation becomes a
post route, & is then guarded from indiscriminate transportation by
the 19* Sec: of the P. O Law. You will then find it easy to Compel
all vessels either to Contract, or to abstain from Conveying letters
at all. When ever the law in any of its provisions is violated, it will
be y' duty to prosecute, unless the offender acted manifestly without
a knowledge of the existence of the law & all intention of offending.
You should endeavour to Contract with the Masters of Coasting
Vessels—or to deter them from offending the requisitions of the law.”

DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 2nd May 1826.
TO COL" JAMES GADSDEN,
SIR, I have received your letter of the 25" March last." In reply
I have the honor to state that no reasons, are known to the Depart-
ment which make a reexamination of the Country allotted to the
emigrant Florida Indians, necessary. My report to the President
to which you refer was made upon the clearest evidence of the suffer-
ing condition of these people; and the causes referr'd to by me, were
such as that condition warranted. It is not reasonable to believe
that with a knowledge on the part of the Indians that the Country
to which they were destined, would not only, not support them, as
it has not, but that they would, in considerable numbers, die upon it,
of hunger, that they would have consented to emigrate; or, that,
with this knowledge, we, on our part, would have provided it for
them, and sent them there. But no intention, I beg you to be assured
was entertained to implicate any statements made by you in regard
to the opinion you had formed of the fitness of the Country; which
I am well satisfied was in strict accordance with the honest convic-
tions of your judgment.
The reports of the Governor of the Territory,” and experience,
demonstrate however, that the Indians have not been able to live
on the lands allotted to them, and that the numbers who have perished
would have been greatly increased, has been made very clear, but
for the extension of an extra provision by the Government. The time
connected with these circumstances, is esteemed to be favorable for
1° NA (WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 8), authorizing Clark to establish an express
between Cant. Brooke and St. Augustine if the troops should not be removed
for use against the Creeks.

[Enclosure]
Petition to the Secretary of the Navy from Baltimore Merchants and
Underwriters
[May, 1825]
To the Honourable Samuel L Southard Secretary of the Navy of the United
States.
The Undersigned Merchants and Underwriters of the City of
Baltimore having learned through the medium of the News papers,
the intention of the Government to withdraw the Naval Depot and
Establishment from Key West, or Thompsons Island and being im-
pressed with the great and increasing importance of that Island to
the Commerce of the United States, and expecially to the City of
Baltimore, beg leave to draw your attention to the necessity of leaving
there some protection for the vessels and Cargoes lying and deposited
at that place. They beg leave to state that within a space of less
than nine months past, goods to the amount of as they are informed
and believe of more than Six hundred thousand Dollars has been
landed and stored on the Island, a part of which was shipped from
Ports in the United States and a part landed from vessels either
wrecked on the Reefs in the neighourhood or retaken from Pirates, of
this amount about one hundred and Seventeen thousand dollars was
shipped from the Port of Baltimore alone, as will appear from the
annexed Schedule. The value and quantity of Merchandise shipped
to that place will no doubt continue to increase with the extension
of the Commerce of the Country and the value of merchandize landed
there from the other Causes mentioned, there is reason to fear will
not be lessened. Key West is also of great importance as a place of
rendezvous for vessels engaged in the trade to the Gulf of Mexico
and the neighbouring West India Islands.
We therefore respectfully request that some efficient protection
may be retained upon the Island, when the Naval Establishment is
withdrawn, for its defence, in which so large a part of the Commercial
Community is interested

[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 1 sess.:LS*]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR Off: Ind: Affairs 4th May 1826.”
TO THE HON” JOHN CoCKE, Chairman of the Committee, of Indian
Affairs, House of Representatives, U.S.—
SIR, I have received this morning a letter from George Graham,
Esq Commissioner of the General Land Office,” in which he encloses
a copy of the Resolution of the Hon: Mr Vinton,” of the 13th U1t°28
and conveys your request to me, to furnish you with any information
I may have relating to the object of the Resolution.
The object of the Resolution is to ascertain what Legislative pro-
vision is necessary to secure to the Florida Indians a sufficient quantity
of good tillable Land for their support.
I can only state for the information of the Committee, that the orig-
inal limits assigned to those Indians have been pronounced to be
inadequate to their support; and that in pursuance of the provision
of the Treaty, twe extensions of the Northern line have been ordered,
but that unless what is called the big Swamp, (as well as the big
Hammock to embrace which those extensions were ordered,) can be
taken in and made to form part of those limits, there will not be a
sufficient quantity of good tillable land for the support and accom-
modation of these emigrants. This big swamp, the Indians having
settled upon it, and the Executive being anxious to extend to them
all the accommodation in his power, has been granted to them for
the time being,-not as a matter of right, but accommodation. It
is believed that lines to be so drawn as to embrace this additional
location, will take in enough of good tillable land, but without this
big Swamp, it is my opinion the Indians cannot be considered as
being provided with a sufficient quantity of good tillable land for their
Support. - -
If this opinion shall be adopted by the Committee, and reference
is respectfully made for its basis, to the Correspondence already sent
* A Representative in Congress from Tennessee.
* A copy is in NA (OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 3); printed contemporaneously in the
Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser, June 17, 1826.

THOMAS L. MCKENNEY TO GOVERNOR DUVAL
[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 3 *]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Off: Ind: Affairs, 8" May 1826.
TO HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Governor of Florida.
SIR, I have received your several letters by Col° Humphreys,” as
has the Secretary of War, that addressed to him.” I am directed by
the Secretary to state that no deputations of Indians can be allowed
to visit Washington except on the express permission of the Depart-
ment. The expense is too great, unless a corresponding object existed
to justify it—but no such object is percceived to authorize the present
visit. When the authority to which you refer was extended there
was an object—but that passed away with the occasion with which it
was connected—nor could it be revived short of an occasion equal at
least in importance to that. A reference to the letter of permission
will show you that it was even then reluctantly given. The Secretary
hopes, nevertheless, that the visit may prove favorable by impressing
upon these people some proper idea of both our strength and kindness.
They will be treated well. The Title of Governor is unusual, and the
Secretary declines confering it on Hicks. He will be distinguished
by a Great Medal, and acknowledged the Chief of his people. It is
well not to multiply Titles. There is safety in observing old and
tried precedents. The head men among Indians, are called Chiefs.
The Indians must be protected on the one hand from the press of
White people, of which you speak; and the White people from the
depredation of Indians, on the other. The provisions of the inter-
course law must form the basis of this mutual protection, and its
enforcement is with you, subject to the approval of the Department.
This must be taken as the answer to some other parts of your corre-
spondence in regard to spoliations, and indeed to all except that which
relates to old claims both ways, the whites against the Indians, and
the Indians against the whites, whether it regards negroes, or any
other kind of property.” Upon the subject of those more ancient
wrongs, it would be just, and may be considered your duty, especially
if the parties request it, for you to collect all the information in regard
to the subjects presented by you, within your reach, and report it to
the Department for its information and Government.—I would re-
spectfully suggest should you engage in collecting and arranging those
cases that you Class them, and be as concise as possible, not only in

this business of Classification of complaints and claims, but in your
general correspondence. This suggestion is made necessary by the
very hard press of duties which require that all details of agencies be
settled on the responsibility of the Agents—I mean of course within
their legitimate sphere of operations, and that reports and references
be studiously brief.
The Secretary approves of your talk to the Indians, in the main,
but thinks it proper to guard you as the official organ of the General
Government against committing yourself in matters pertaining to
the internal affairs, of the Indians. You pledge yourself for example
to see to the security of their Chief. The making and unmaking of
Chiefs must be left to the Indians themselves, as also all that relates
to their own regulations for their own Government. You can and
ought to Counsel and advise them for their good, in these matters—
but no more.
In your letter of the 2" March you speak of the Smiths-Shop, and
of a list of tools which you say the Agent will show me. These are
details that cannot be looked into here, they must be left with the
Agent to settle. The provision for the shop is made, and you have
been directed to apply it. You know the amount ($1000) and will
keep the expenses within it. The appropriation for this object pro-
vides not only for the support of a Gun Smith, but “the expenses
incident to the shop,” according to the terms of the Treaty. No
addition can be allowed to the 2,000$ authorized to be expended in
building an agency House. Nor can any diversion be made of the
money appropriated for schools; and as no school has gone into
operation, and none in prospect, you will refund what has been
remitted on that account. Whatever the feelings of the Indians may
be, in regard to the schools for the present, these will change with
time and proper instruction, and explanation, and the fund will be
meanwhile accumulating. The appropriation cannot be directed to
other objects. The arts which you esteem, and justly, to be so
important, are taught in the schools, under the Government system,
it is part of this system. There is no mistake in the plan of Civilizing
the red men. Proofs are numerous in the flourishing condition of
many of the Tribes.
No buying or selling of Slaves will be permitted by the Agent, or
for the Agency. If the Indians own slaves they are their property;
if they secrete runaway slaves they must give them up, to their
rightful owners. If the whites take theirs the law of intercourse
must be resorted to. You will explain to the Department the neces-
sity for the use of Six horses and a Wagon, and by what authority they
have been purchased.

I am directed by the Secretary of War explicitly to require prompt
quarterly returns. The regulations demand it, and unless these are
received, the remittances for the agency cannot be made in future.
I find you are altogether deficient in forms, for your returns.
These I will supply.
It is absolutely indispensable that you keep your contingent appor-
tionment, which is, now fixed at $3000 per annum, and $500 for
presents, within these sums." You will not, of course, exceed the
specific appropriations."—

Copy ST. AUGUSTINE 9th May 1826.
SIR, I deem it my duty to make Known to you a fact, (for the
information of the President of the United States) which I think
deeply concerns the government of this Territory. It is this, the
business of auctioneer at Key West, since wrecked goods have been
carried there and sold to an immense amount has become very profit-
able. By an Act of the Legislative Council passed at the last Session,
the enormous commission of 6 per cent is allowed to Auctioneers in
this Territory in all cases.” It is estimated that wrecked property
to the amount of nearly half a million of dollars, since the passage of
this Act has been taken and sold at auction at Key West; for notwith-
standing the repeal of the Territorial wrecking law by Congress,” the
wreckers Still carry their Cargoes there, and by what they pretend
to be an arbitration the Same abuses are practised as formerly.
from 75 to 80 per cent is often allowed. There is but one auctioneer
for the whole Island, and he is George Walton Esq" the Secretary of
this Territory, Treasurer, and Acting Governor himself. Col. Walton
I believe resides at Tallahassee, but he carries on the business of an
auctioneer at Key West, by deputy—that is Richard Fitzpatrick who
resides there transacts the business in the name of Col: Walton as
his deputy, agent or attorney. Whether Col: Walton holds the

the sum of $9,000, with the following apportionment: $3,000 for the pay of the
Indian superintendent and the subagent, $5,000 for Indian annuities, and $1,000
for school and blacksmith.

commission of Auctioneer from the Governor or not I do not know,
but the fact that all wrecked goods carried to that Island are Sold in
his name as the Auctioneer, M." Fitzpatrick acting as his deputy,
agent or attorney, is unquestionably true. I derive my information
from M* Thomas Murphy, a gentleman of this place of respectability
and intelligence, who was at Key West about two months ago and saw
advertisements of good's for sale at auction in the above mentioned
manner, and a number of persons belonging to this place and who
went to Key West several months ago have lately returned sick and
in great distress. They all confirm the Statement of M* Murphy
and say that it was generally understood and believed at Key West
that Col: Walton was the partner of M" Fitzpatrick in the Auctioneers
business carried on there.
I do not indeed Know of any express law which forbids the Secre-
tary of this Territory, though holding a high honorable and profitable
office by appointment of the President of the United States, from also
holding a very profitable office by appointment of the Governor of
this Territory, and exercising that office by deputy some five or
Six hundred miles from his place of residence. But there appears
to me to be a great impropriety in Such an arrangement. My views
of the matter may however be erroneous, and I respectfully Submit
the above information to the consideration of the President.

[Enclosure]
The Secretary of War to Delegation of Florida Indians "
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 10* May 1826.
TO THE DELEGATION OF FLORIDA INDIANS, FRIENDS & BROTHERS,
I have considered your request to have your boundary line extended,
and made it known to your Great Father, the President. I am di-
rected to answer, that he gives his consent for you to occupy the Big
Swamp until he may have a call for it, when he will expect you to
move within the limits of the survey. He sent you this message by
Governor Duval.
Your Great Father does not wish to oppress his Red Children.
He has heard of your sufferings, and sent you some help. But he
wishes me to inform you, that you have had time to plant and gather
your crops, that you must rely for the future, on yourselves, and by
your industry provide for your own support.
Brothers—Your Great Father has heard that you have runaway
Slaves in your Country, and that many of your people hide them
from their owners. The Treaty provides that you should give them
* See ante, p. 185, n.
* Humphreys wrote DuVal from Baltimore, Md., June 4, 1826, that he had
just embarked the Indians on board a ship bound for St. Augustine, and that he
was waiting for a boat to New York, whence, after seeing George Walton, who
had left for that place three days before, he would proceed to his home in Massa-
chusetts. The Indian delegation, he stated, was satisfied with the visit, and
Hicks had made a good impression in Washington (NA, SF, 22 Cong., 1 sess.,
nomination papers, W. P. DuVal). See also Humphreys to Secretary of War,
May 19, 1826 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Seminole), submitting a statement of the
expenses of the Fla. Indian delegation (present).

up. It is expected that you will do this; and that you will hereafter
so soon as a Slave runs into your Country, take him up and deliver
him to the Agent for his rightful owner. It is said that the whites
have some of your Slaves. The agent is directed to see justice done
you, and wherever he finds your slaves in possession of the whites to
demand their surrender.
Brothers.—Now that you are settled in your new homes, I have to
call your attention to a few things. Your young men are not always
good. They go into the settlements and steal, and kill stock, and
alarm the whites, and the Women and Children. This must not be.
You will therefore give orders to your young men to keep within your
limits, and if they will not obey you, you must punish them. If
you do not, Your Great Father will order his agent to let a heavy hand
fall upon you. If the whites trespass upon you, do not strike—but
go to the agent—he is directed to protect you. You must listen to
these directions. Your Great Father will be kind to you, if you obey
his Counsel—but if you do not, you will be punished.
Brothers—Your Great Father expects you to live in peace with
one another, to be industrious and sober. Drunkenness is a curse,
and no Indian ought ever to get drunk. It makes him a beast—
and brings him into trouble. Let alone the mad water, and be sober.
Brothers.—The Treaty provides a thousand Dollars for the support
of a School at the Agency. This is intended to benefit your Children.
It is time it was in operation. It is there your Children will learn to
read, and write, and keep accounts; and how to make ploughs, and
wheels, and looms and how to use them, and all other things useful
to you. Your Great Father expects you to encourage these improve-
ments in your Children. The agent is directed to seek for a Teacher,
and when one goes out, he will go under the protection of your Great
Father.
Brothers—I explained to you that I did not expect you could live
so well where you are, as on lands where the game is plenty and water
good and abundant. Your Great Father owns a great Country over
the Mississippi, and is willing to give you a large portion of it, when-
ever you may incline to go. And, if a few of your Chiefs think proper
to visit it and bring you back word what sort of Country it is, they
can go, and the agent will be directed to send them, and pay their
expenses. It is expected that some of your friends of the Musk-
hogues Tribe will go and look at that Country—Your Chiefs might
go at the same time.
This advice is for your good—and is given to you in friendship.
I hope you will follow it.
Brothers—I once more tell you, your Great Father will protect you,
through the agent, from the bad conduct of the whites, and he will

severely punish you if you do not prevent your bad men from going
into the settlements and doing harm to the whites. This you must
not forget. If you will take the property of the whites the value
of it will be taken from your annuity. The agent is ordered to do so.
Brothers—I shake hands with you, and wish you, prosperity and
happiness."—

SIR, In answer to your request, that I would furnish you with such
information, as I possessed, in regard to the public road, between this
City and Tallahassee, lately laid out and constructed by Mr Bellamy,
under a contract made with Capt. Burch, of the Army of the United
States, acting on behalf of the United States, I have the honour to
State, that I have no personal knowledge of the condition of this road,
nor how far M. Bellamy has fulfilled his contract, having never myself
been on the road, nor seen the contract in question. All that I know
of this road is derived from the information of others, some of whom
had travelled for a considerable distance on it, and others reported to
me the general opinion of travellers. Mr Streeter, the Sheriff of this
County, and post master in this City, mentioned to me, some time
ago, that the road was very badly made. Mr John Robinson of New
York, made a visit to Tallahassee, from this place, about a month
ago, and travelled, as he informed me, about a hundred miles on the
road. He stated to me, on his return from Tallahassee, that the road
was made in a very slight and insecure manner; and the stumps of the
trees left standing to a considerable height on the road. Lieut.
Cooper of the army of the U. S., visited Tallahassee, soon after
* Samuel Cooper.

Quartermaster General, May 19, 1826 (NA, WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File),
printed, Boyd (ed.), op. cit., pp. 172–175.


## p. 544 (#562) ############################################

544 T E R R H TO R J A L PA P E R S
Mr Robinson returned from that place, and confirmed, to the utmost
extent, the statement which M. Robinson had previously given of
the condition of this road. I did not myself converse with M*
Cooper on the subject, but was informed by Lieut. Brown, of what he
had reported. M. Gould, the editor of the newspaper printed here
also informed me, that all travellers agreed in opinion that the road
was very badly made, and by no means conformably to the pro-
posals for the contract published by Capt. Burch.
I understand also, that M* Waters Smith, the U. S Marshal for
this district, Mr Streeter the Sheriff, and M. Reynolds, the Mayor of
this City, and Lieut Brown have all recently been on a part of the
road, between this City and the S" John's river, and that it is their
unanimous opinion that the road is very badly made.
With regard to depositions to substantiate these facts, I do not
believe that I can conveniently procure them. Both M. Robinson
and Lieut. Cooper, who gave information respecting the road beyond
the St John's river, have left this City. Besides, permit me to ob-
serve, that depositions do not appear to me to be the best mode of
ascertaining the true condition of this road. Contradictory deposi-
tions may probably be given by the friends of the Contractor. The
best, and indeed, in my opinion, the only sure mode to obtain correct
information on the subject, would be to send an officer of the Army
to examine the road, all the way to Tallahassee. On his return he
would be able to make a report that might be depended upon.”

SIR, In compliance with your request, in answering your enquiries,
relative to the public road between S. Johns, & the Ockolockeney
Rivers, I shall describe briefly, to the best of my recollection, the state
of said road, over which I travelled, in the month of March last.
About nine miles from the River S" Johns, I entered on the road
alluded to, & continued my journey thereon about Twenty miles—
The road, to the best of my judgment, is not more than Sixteen feet
wide, and although, I am not much conversant with roads, yet, I am

inclined to think, that the distance of Sixteen feet, is too narrow for
the ordinary purposes of travelling, in this part of Florida:—On the
part of the road on which I have travelled, many places are low, and
in rainy weather usually overflow’d and necessarily require to have
causeways to make them passable.—I have observed only one cause-
way, which appeared to me to be roughly done, & imperfect; and
according to my opinion, the road in other places, required causeways,
& bridges, to make it suitable for travelling—
The Stumps were generally too high, to make travelling convenient
for Carriages, Waggons &c, and on the whole, the Road, as far as I had
an opportunity of observing it, did not appear to me, to be constructed,
in conformity to the Terms which I had seen in the Proposals pub-
lished in the East Florida Herald of the 4* January 1825–
This simple statement of the part of the Road over which I
travelled, is submitted according to your request, not with a view of
impugning the diligence, & correctness of M* Bellamy, who no doubt,
had many difficulties to contend with, but of giving a candid descrip-
tion, without reference to the parties concerned in any way whatso-

TALLAHASSEE 17 May 1826
SIR I understand that an appropriation of 20,000 dollars has
been sanctioned by Congress for the relief of the Florida Indians *—
As their supposed starving condition has been ascribed to the treaty
concluded with them nearly 3 years since, and has given rise to some
very unjust reflections on the Commissioners who negotiated that
compact, I feel authorised to address you once more on this Subject
that any future distress among the Refugees may be ascribed to the
true cause, and not to Individuals who have had no agency in pro-
ducing them—
The provisioning the Emigrant Indians was one of the stipulations
in the treaty, and the liberality of that article, I am inclined to think,
contributed in some degree to the distress now complained of, for it is
a singular fact, that that portion of the nation who were considered as

excluded from its provisions, are now in a condition greatly superior
to those who have been bountifully fed the previous year—The provi-
sioning the Indians for one year was intended to assist & facilitate,
not prevent their immediate location, and the issues should have been
controlled not by numbers solely but by settlements, and actual loca-
tion with improvement of the soil should have been received as
evidence of their title to the bounty extended—In this way the issues
would have operated as a stimulant to the cultivation of the earth,
and the Indian would have early discovered that being fed one year
was not intended to produce a starving condition the next—The plan
adopted was however on principles somewhat the reverse—Camps
were in some instances permitted to be formed in the neighbourhood
of Depots, provisions were consumed as if there was to be no termina-
tion to the issues, and all exertions were suspended on the part of the
Indians even to the neglect of the hunting season, as if the Govern-
mental bounty of the present was to last through succeeding years—I
do not say that this was general; The most deserving Chiefs with their
followers had more foresight and early commenced those agricultural
establishments which were necessary for their future subsistence and
comfort—But the Refugee party, who merit neither the sympathy or
bounty of the General Government acted quite the reverse and those
are the men who are now reported to be suffering, and who will con-
tinue in a suffering condition, as an apology for their depredations, the
moment the governmental bounty is suspended.
In thus adverting to the mode adopted in issuing provisions to the
Indians under the stipulations to that effect in the treaty, I would
wish to be understood as speculating solely on its supposed effects,
and not as distantly reflecting on the agents who were governed by
what had been the invariable practise elsewhere—A different plan
however, limited as will be suggested in this communication, is calcu-
lated in my opinion to produce the results contemplated, and the
relief extended to the Suffering Indians may be made by judicious
management the means of concentrating locating, and acquiring a
control over them *—
It is not the incapacity of the country to Sustain the Indians which
has produced the condition to which a portion of them are reduced, or
which has impelled them to the acts of depredation complained of; but
the same restless, lawless spirit which has hurried them into all the
irregularities of which for years they have been guilty and to which
there will be no termination without the exercise of some authority on
the part of the General Government with a view to the introduction

of wholesome discipline among them—Though late with the means
again at command, it is not an unpropitious moment to act with
effect, and the interest which in common with the citizens of this
territory I feel on this subject will be my apology for again suggesting
to your consideration, that simultaneous with the recommencement
of the issues of provisions there should be established a military post
on the northern limit of the Indian Country; That the issues of provi-
sions under the control of the agent should be within the country
allotted the Indians and confined to those who actually commence
improvements and are unremitted in their efforts towards raising the
necessary supplies for their subsistence the succeeding years—That all
those who will not concentrate within the boundaries marked, or who
may be found beyond them after a certain period should be considered
as Outlaws to be delt with according to instructions from the President
of the U S or as any territorial law may direct—The effect of such a
policy rigidly enforced will at once draw the line of distinction between
those Indians who merit protection and those who merely hang upon
the advanced settlements to depredate and plunder—These under the
enforcement of a necessary discipline will either return to the Creek
nation from whence they absconded, or quit the territory for some
other country more congenial to their habits—They are a band of
restless savages who have infested our Southern border ever since the
termination of the Creek war of 1813—Wandering Ishmalites their
hands are, and will continue to be raised against every people who will
not assume the authority they have power to exercise, and subdüe
repress by compulsion irregularities which moderation cannot

[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Seminole: C*]
[May 17, 1826]
Talk of the Florida Delegation of Indians delivered by Tuckasee
Mothla, the Head Chief, in reply to one from the Hon" James
Barbour Secretary of War,
Brother We have heard the talk you sent us by our Agent—You
say our Great Father gives us permission to occupy the land we
ask for (the Big Swamp") until he may want to send us from it—
This does not please us—The land we occupy, we expect will be
considered our own property, to remain as such for ever, unless we may
think proper to part with it—If this is refused us, we can not be happy,
for we do not like the thoughts of being put to the trouble of moving
again—The hardship we suffered from our first removal, gave us pain
enough—We do not wish to feel it again, and we have such confidence
in the justice of the our Great Father, that we do not believe he will
force it upon us, but will comply with our demands and give us more
land—This was promised us by the Treaty of S*Augustine—We only
ask that this promise should be complied with—It is necessary to
make us comfortable—The tract of land embraced in the present limits
of our Territory ef lahd, is small & very poor—We cannot live on it—
Many have been obliged to Settle in the Big Swamp where some good
land has been found–Give that to us also—We shall then be able to
make bread for our wives & children and shall be satisfied—When we
left the good land about Tallahassee and Mickasuky which is now
covered by the White Skins, we stopped at the Big Swamp because we
knew we could not live further South, and because we were to hold by
Governor Duval, that we might do so; and that we should have the
land—We now claim the fulfillment of his promise, and of that in the
Treaty.—We were often deceived by the Spaniards—They made
promises which they never kept—But we were told, “the Americans are
a straight people—We believed it—We hope we shall never have cause
to change our minds.—
You say our Great Father, sent help to our people, who have been
hungry because they could make no corn last year—We feel thankful
for this and will not forget it.—
You tell us at the same time, that our Great Father says we must
in future rely upon ourselves & by our industry, provide for our own

support—We do not complain of this, but we expect he will not deny
us such lands as will enable us to do so—You Say too, our Great
father does not wish to oppress his red children—We believe it and
that he will keep the treaty & give us more land.—We ask that the
north line of our territory may be removed so as to embrace a small
swamp called Wectooxy.—This will enable us to live and make us
contented.—
Brother, you tell us that our Great Father owns a great country
over the Big River towards the setting sun and that he is willing to
give us a part of it if we will go there and he advises us to send some
of our chiefs with the Muscogees when they go, to look at it, and
bring us back word what sort of Country it is—We have already said
we do not intend to move again—If the Muscogees have a disposition
to go further towards the setting sun, we are perfectly willing they
should go; but we will not go with them—We have no friends there,
the people of that country are strangers to us—The Muscogees in-
vited us to go with them, but it was only to make their party
stronger—We will not involve ourselves in the troubles of the Mus-
cogees—We are a separate people and have nothing to do with them—
We came brother not to see the Muscogees, but to hold a talk with our
Great father on our own affairs and to claim of him more land in our
own Country—Most of us were born on the land we now inhabit &
that which we claim to be surrendered to us.—here our navel strings
were first cut & the blood from them, sunk into the earth, & made the
country dear to us.—We have heard that the Spaniards sold this
Country to the Americans—This they had no right to do, -the land
was not theirs, but belonged to the Seminoles—Brother, we have
come here, where we should find Spanish, English, French and
Americans; to talk with our Great Father about this matter & have
it put right—We have not yet seen our Great Father, —We have come
many days travel to see him and do not wish to return without
shaking hands with him—
You tell us brother, that our Great Father has heard that we have
runaway Slaves in our Country and that many of our people hide
them from their owners—It is true that some slaves who run away
from the whites have come into our Country—Most of them however
were given up, before we left home:—we think that by this time, the
rest of them are with their owners—We left orders with some of our
chiefs to have them taken and brought to the agency
We do not like the story that our people hide the runaway negroes
from their masters
It is not a true talk—Our people have not done this—We do not
consider ourselves bound by the Treaty, to take up any runaway
slaves, but those who have entered our country since the making of

the Treaty—But we have never prevented the whites from coming
into our country and taking their slaves wherever they could find
them & we will not hereafter oppose their doing so, but will give them
all the assistance we can.—
Brother, –We are glad to hear that our negroes held by the whites,
are to be claimed for us. This is right, and we hope that our Great
Father will put it in the power of our Agent to see justice done us in
this matter—We do not know if the white people will mind his talks
when he demands our property, for they are not always willing to do
right when they can avoid it—The laws of our nation are strong &
oblige a man having the property of another in his possession, to give
it up to the right owner.—The laws of the whites, who have so much
better sense than the red men, ought not to be less powerful and just—
Brother—You say that some of our young men are not always good
and that they go among the whites and kill their stock—A few of
them we know have done this and we have punished them for it, and
we have lately made such laws as we think will prevent their going so
any more—It is not our wish to disturb our white neighbours but to
live in friendship with them.
Brother—You tell us that our Great Father wishes to place a school
in our nation to teach our children to read & write—We do not wish
one at all—We do not believe the great Spirit intended we should
know how to read & write; for if he had intended this, he would have
given us the knowledge as early as he gave it to the white people—
Now it is too late; the white people have gained an advantage, we
can never recover and it is better for us to remain as we are, red men &
live in our own way.—Brother, among our people it is thought that
at the time when there were but two kinds of people, the red and the
white, on the earth, a book was placed by the Great Spirit in the hands
of an old man, blind, and with a long beard, who told the red and the
white man, that he who killed the first Deer, should receive the book
as his reward & be learnt to read it—Both went out to hunt different
ways—The white man after going a little way, found a sheep, which
being not so wild as the Deer, he easily Killed-
He took this sheep to the blind man & told him it was a Deer—
The old man believed him and gave him the book and learnt him how
to read it—The red man soon after brought in a deer, but he was too
late—the white man had got the book—If this cheat had not been
practised, the red man would have been now as the white man is &
he as the red man-
Brother—If the Great Sprit had intended that the red men should
know how to read, he would not have allowed the white man to take
this advantage of us.

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
ST: AUGUSTINE, May 18" 1826.
GENERAL, I have the honor to report my arrival at this place
last evening, having travelled hither with a view to the Inspection
of the Road opened under M. Bellamy's contracts made with me
as Agent for the United States, the time being about to expire when
they were required to have been completed. Major Pierce handed
me this morning your letter of the 21" April last in relation to certain
complaints made by M. Rodman respecting the Road,” also a copy
of his letter making the complaint. If public Rumour is to govern
respecting the fulfilment of these contracts, as much perhaps would
be said in its favor as against it according as different persons might
view it, & according to the seasons, whether wet or dry; in fact it is
rare that any two persons perhaps should be found who would agree
in opinion, so various are those which I have myself heard expressed,
respecting the most proper mode of construction for a Road. But
any complaint or discussion of this kind was, & is, wholly unneces-
sary, for I have myself decided that the Road under neither of the
contracts made with M* Bellamy is completed according to the
letter of the contract of course neither has been received. That from
* A brief reply by the Secretary of War, May 22, 1826 (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent,

northern line of their country farther north and regretted their attitude toward
education. See post, p. 557.

the Ocholochonee to St: Johns is not yet entirely completed as he
had himself intended it for offering to inspection, & his hands are
still at work on it. That from St: John's to this City he considers
as being completed. I have examined it and in my opinion, all that
could be required under the contract has been done, with some excep-
tions of but little consequence, considered as to the labor which it
would require to complete it. The contract states that in any differ-
ence between the Contractor & myself, an umpire shall be chosen by
us jointly, to decide such question. This however I have not done,
preferring, in consequence of your letter to Major Pierce to await
further instructions from you, under the belief it is quite possible
that it is your intention to appoint a Commissioner to inspect and
receive the Road independent of myself; and in that case anything
now done by me would be a dead letter. Although between this
and the St: John's some work remains undone which In my opinion
ought to have been done, yet much more has been done in other
places than the contract, or even practical use viewing it in connec-
tion with what was to be the general mode of constructing the Road,
required. The land between this place & the St. Johns is low pine
barren, a great portion of which is covered with water in rainy seasons,
but it is firm hard sand with scarcely a rod of miry & marshy ground.
Such places however in this low land as were particularly low & wet
have been to a very considerable extent ditched & thrown up; and is
now that the country is dry, a fine loose sand, not as convenient to
travel over as if it had been left in its natural state, yet the throwing
it up will be in future of very great service to the Road. There is
also much of the low lands of the same description west of the St:
Johns River that have been thrown up. I have all along been per-
fectly aware in my different examinations of the Road that the con-
tract had not been strictly complied with, but I was anxious to have
it opened through as speedily as possible & placed in travelling order,
& therefore forbore to direct such portions of it to be altered or im-
proved until the whole should be recommenced; the contractor
having always expressed the utmost willingness to comply with any
of my Requisitions hereafter. Accordingly the Road is now opened
to this place, & is in as good travelling order as any rough unbroken
Road constructed through a wilderness can be-
I knew that much had been said about the Road, & the more,
because many persons expected it to be a turnpike, & in consequence
of that, also of my own situation in regard to M.” Bellamy's family, I
requested Capt. Clark Ass: Q M to join me at Tallahassee to view
the Road with me which he has done, & coincides with me in opinion
as to the non-fulfilment of the contract in the construction of the
Road. In expressing such an opinion however it is not to be under-

stood that there is any material deficiencies nor such as could not be
easily remedied, but sufficient only to prevent its being accepted in
its present state."—
The time for the completion of the first of these contracts expired
on the 31* December last, & the second expires on the 30" June next;
but the first having been extended by me, (if my act in that respect
is approved, of which I am not advised,) both expire on the latter
date; & the bonds will be forfeited to the Government if it is thought
proper to exercise such power, in case the Road should not be then
received. The primary reason why these Roads were not finished
long since arose from the unusually wet seasons since the contracts
were entered into. In fact to such an extent has the water, to my own
personal knowledge, covered the low grounds & filled the ponds on
this Route, that it was impracticable to causeway & construct the
Road properly until in the present spring since the first of March last.
If I had had the troops on many parts of this section of Road, I should
unquestionably have abandoned the work until a dry season could
have enabled me to work to advantage.—
In reference to my instructions touching this Road it is possible I
may have been mistaken too as to the meaning." They required that
all the Streams should be bridged & the miry, marshy, ground cause-
wayed. Many seem to be of opinion that all the low, sandy, pine
lands either were to have been, or at least ought to be thrown up. If
that was the intention, I have mistaken the meaning of the order, &
have erred both in explaining what was required to be done to such
low grounds under the advertisements & when forming the contracts.
++ that was the intentień I have mistakeh—If the Road was really to
have been turnpiked, it would cost at least $200,000 to make the Road
from this place to Tallahassee, so much of that description of land is
to be found on the Route. on this subject I request you will please
to inform me. My own impressions certainly were, that a good
practicable Road, which could be passed at all seasons, wet or dry,
with carriages, was all that was intended either by your instructions
or the Act of Congress. That system I have endeavored to adhere to
in its construction. It surely cannot be expected that any Road
should be entirely exempt from the casualties of freshets or hurri-
canes,—even the most permanently constructed turnpikes require
constant repairs to preserve them from being broken into Ravines,—
of course the causeways on this Road must be subject to being swept
away; though so far, not one was swept off or injured, although not
fully completed & secured, in the very heavy Rains of the last winter.—

I have now but one favor to ask of you in relation to these con-
tracts;—That some other person may be forthwith appointed to act
in my stead in examing & receiving the Road.” And when such
inspection is made I shall of course accompany the Commissioner on
the Road. I request you will please to reply to this letter as soon as
convenient as I think it important both to myself & the Contractor
that a decision should be speedily had; and if a Commissioner is to be
appointed I will thank you to inform me who he is. I am of opinion
that the inspection should commence at Tallahassee.—
I shall leave here tomorrow for Tallahassee where I shall remain
until I receive your letter, (if no duty requires my immediate return to
Pensacola,) which I request may be forwarded in duplicate, one to
Tallahassee & one to Pensacola. I am myself desirous to remain in
that Section of Country until this Road is completed & the business
settled.—
I shall from Tallahassee write again on the subject of the width of
the Road which I think it unnecessary to increase to the full twenty
five feet for any practical purpose; though I should prefer having it
done for appearance sake, in case I can command the services of the
Troops at Pensacola, & there is money for the purpose."—

COMMISSION OF THOMAS DOUGLAS AS UNITED STATES
ATTORNEY (EAST FLORIDA)
[NA:SD, Attys. Comms. Perm., Bk. 1]

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, President of the United States of America
To all who shall see these presents, greeting:
Know Ye, That, reposing special trust and confidence in the
Integrity, Ability, and Learning of THOMAS DOUGLASS, of Indiana I
have nominated, and, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate," Do appoint him, Attorney of the United States, in and for
the District of East Florida and do authorize and empower him
to execute and fulfil the duties of that Office according to Law; and
to have and to hold the same with all the powers, privileges, and
emoluments thereto of right appertaining, unto him, the said THOMAS
DOUGLASS, for the term of four years from the day of the date hereof
unless the President of the United States for the time being, should
be pleased sooner to revoke and determine this Commission.”
In Testimony Whereof, I have caused these Letters to
be made Patent, and the Seal of the United States to be
hereunto affixed. Given under my Hand, at the City of
Washington, the twenty Second Day of May in the Year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and twenty Six, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the Fiftieth.

By the President,
H. CLAY. Secretary of State.
* Nominated on May 16, 1826 and confirmed May 22 (Senate, Exec. Journal,
III, 540, 542). The commission was transmitted to him on May 25 (NA, SD,
Dom. Lets., XXI). He acknowledged it on June 22, 1826 (NA, SD, Acceptances),
and on Aug. 22 wrote that he was on his way to Florida (NA, SD, Misc. Lets.).
Douglas was reappointed on May 25, 1830, May 8, 1834, Apr. 21, 1838, and
July 13, 1842. Some account of his activities as United States attorney can be
found in his book entitled Autobiography of Thomas Douglas, Late Judge of the
Supreme Court of Florida (New York, 1856).
* Other applications for the appointment are in NA (SD, Applications).
Thomas F. Cornell, a resident of St. Augustine for nearly four years and a prac-
ticing lawyer, and acting district attorney, applied to the Secretary of State,
Mar. 28, 1826. With his application is a recommendation from Waters Smith,
dated Mar. 28. Pending the arrival of Douglas, Cornell was appointed by
Judge Smith as acting District Attorney (Smith to Del. White, Jan. 27, 1827,
NA, HF, Rept. 105, Comm. on Terrs., 20 Cong., 1 sess.). A bill to compensate
Cornell for this service passed the House, May 12, 1828 (House Journal, 20 Cong.,
1 sess., p. 730), but failed of passage in the Senate (Senate Journal, 20 Cong.,
2 sess., p. 130). Another lawyer resident in East Florida, Benjamin A. Putnam,

To HIS EXCELLENCY WILLIAM P. DUVAL, Govt of Florida.
SIR, The Secretary of War directs me to state to you that the
President being satisfied that the section of Country assigned for the
Florida Indians does not contain a sufficiency of good tillable land for
their support, and upon their earnest entreaty to have the limits
extended so as to embrace the “Big Swamp”, as well as the Big
Hammock, he has concluded under the provision of the Treaty,
vesting such power in him, to extend the Northern line so far as to
comply with the object of the Treaty in this particular. It is deemed
however, important that in fixing the limits, that suitable, and well
defined lines be first specified, as well to avoid difficulties in regard to
what are the true limits, as to govern the operations of the intercourse
Law. You will therefore report such designations as shall embrace
this Big Swamp, provided it shall be necessary to include it all: If
not, such portion of it as may be essential to give these people a
sufficiency of good tillable land."—
I have &c. &c.

however believe he has never examined the County, his information
is the same as mine, I immagine; obtained from the Citizens, their
statements vary very much, and their knowledge of the County
appears to me to be very limited, never haveing traveled through:
except on the old trail leading to S' Marys. this they describe as
being a very low swampy County, which will require causewaying,
and the ground thrown up for several miles, it will be therefore
necessary for me to examine the Country well before I can determine
and mark out the route, this Cannot well be done before the rainy
season is over, which is generally about the Middle of September,
any attempt at present would be useless should the rains continue as
they have for the two last seasons, this will cause no delay in opening
the road, for the Troops cannot Commence the labour before the
first of October, I think then if the seasons should prove favourable,
the road may be compleated by the last of December.
I have fully assertained that no supplies can be obtained in that
Country, except a little Corn, and that is very doubtfull, as their
Crops at present look miserable.
As the Supplies both for the Troops, forage for the Teams, tools
baggage &c. must be transported one hundred and thirty miles,
before the work Commences, and then to Continue on as they progress,
it will require at least Eight good substantial Mule Teams, four Mules
each, besides two or three extra Mules to carry water to to the working
parties, these Teams, with Waggons, Harness, forage &c. must be
transported from Pensacola, I shall immediately make my requisitions
on Capt Burch that he may have time to procure the supplies and
transport them to this place by the 15" of September.
Could a portion of the supplies be furnished from Charleston and
transported up the S" Johns to Picolati, the point where the road
from Pensacola crosses for Augustine, the land carriage from that,
to where this road will intersect, I believe will not be more than thirty
five or forty miles, and probably part of the Supplies may be taken
up black Creek to the ferry in barges, I have not been able as yet to
obtain any Correct information on that Subject. the report of the
Citizens vary on that point, I have found that the only means of
acquireing a Correct knowledge of the Country streams &C. is to
make a personal examination.
be assured Sir, I shall exert myself to acquire a knowledge of the
Country. to obtain the Supplies, and faciliate the opening the road
in the shortest possible time.
I am happy to say that Col” Brooke is disposed to give every
facility in his power to compleating the work.”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY JOHN W. SIMONTON
[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 2 sess.:Pr]
[May 28, 1826]
To the Members of Both Houses of Congress.
The establishing of a Court at the island of Key West, is founded
on a necessity so strong, that little need be said to prove its propriety.
The Senate have thought proper to sanction a bill for that purpose; *
it is presumed the reasons which induced it, when properly presented,
will claim an equal force before the House of Representatives, to
whom the bill from the Senate has been referred.”
The population of the island is at present nothing short of three
hundred souls, while the county of Monroe, of which this Key is
81 Present.
* Acknowledged June 27, 1826 (NA, WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 9). See post 614.
* Passed Apr. 26, 1826 (Senate Journal, 19 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 185,267, 270).
* In the House the Committee on the Judiciary reported the bill which was
referred to the Committee of the Whole House, May 4, 1826 (House Journal,
19 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 474, 475, 511). No further action on it is noted. A bill
providing for a southern judicial district was finally passed and approved May 23,
1828 (4 STAT. 291–292), the court to be located at Key West.

the Capital, amounts to seven hundred, which is daily and rapidly
increasing. It must hence result, as matter of course, that differ-
ences and disputes of a civil, and charges too of a criminal nature,
must occasionally arise, requiring the interposition of the Judiciary.
Protection and allegiance are reciprocal terms. It is a principle
for which the United States have always contended, and which,
even in their colonial state, they boldly asserted. But when it is
borne in mind that the population of this island, being citizens of
the States, are at a distance of four hundred miles from Pensacola,
which is the nearest point to which a judicial reference can be had,
the trouble, expense, and difficulty, to which they must and will be
subjected, must at once be obvious. If a civil suit shall arise, thither,
or to St. Augustine, which is a hundred miles more distant, must the
parties proceed, to obtain a decision of the difference; while, should
it be a criminal matter, the accused, contrary to that lenity and
indulgence which other citizens of the United States are possessed
of, must necessarily be carried to a distance from his friends and
home, put upon his trial, remotely from the point where his witnesses
are; and, if a poor and humble man, be greatly without the means of
enforcing their attendance. The affluent and the wealthy are never
without the means of sustaining and defending themselves, and derive
other facilities than those which the law itself extends. Legal inter-
position in their behalf is perhaps not a matter of such great necessity,
although it is still right and proper, that even for them, proper tri-
bunals should by the government be established. But with the man
who is without property and without friends, whose life and liberty
alike deserve to claim protection from his country, the thing is dif-
ferent. Charge him with an offence, and without a court to hear him,
he must be seized and carried to Pensacola or St. Augustine for trial,
where to be confronted with witnesses will be difficult, and where
the appearance of his own for the purpose of defence and acquittal,
will be rendered by the distance impracticable, if not impossible.
Difficulty of prosecution will exist on the one side, while on the
other the means of defence will be procured at great expense, and at
still greater hazard.
Considered in this point of view only, it would seem, that enough
is urged to induce a belief, that the measure proposed is correct and
right. A reference to our former history will show, that in our list
of grievances, pressed against the mother country, was the sending
our citizens abroad for trial; and certainly it was strongly urged.
It was decried as a grievous and heavy imposition, and one altogether
contrary to the rights of the governed. But in what consisted the
difference, in the cases then complained of, and in the present?
To be sure, the distance was greater from America to England, than


## p. 562 (#580) ############################################

562 T E R R H TO R J A L PA P E H S
from Key West to the United States. Yet in the principle there was
no difference. In both there is perfect identity. The complaints
then urged was the inconvenience to which the accused was sub-
jected, the increased hazard necessarily to be met, -the injury done
to the unoffending, in forcing them to appear as witnesses on the
prosecution, and the unavoidable consequent and increased dangers
to which the accused was exposed by being dragged to a distance
from his home and friends, where character might aid him, and from
witnesses whose attendance might not be in his power to procure.
The Government of the United States, it is respectfully conceived,
ought not, in cases of such strong resemblance, so soon to forget
the strenuousness with which the right now asked for was by them
so fearlessly urged and maintained. Were the citizens of Key West
within any reasonable distance of a court, where judicial investiga-
tion could be had, the cases would be different; but, surely it cannot
be considered other than a grievance, when it is apparent that no
remedy is presented, short of proceeding 4 or 500 miles to obtain
it, at great cost, and at an imminent risk both to life and liberty.
Nor are the people of the Island alone interested in this business.
The frequent wrecks which take place along the reef of Florida, makes
it matter of interest to the citizens of our commercial towns, who of
course are in want of some tribunal competent and independent,
which, in reference to all the circumstances, may decide upon the
amount of salvage, properly chargeable on the various shipwrecks
that take place. The property when abandoned must in some way
or other be disposed of. The wrecker, with a view to his own interest,
will carry it to that point, where least hazard from the dangers of the
sea will be encountered, and where on its arrival it may most speedily
be decided on. Heretofore, for the want of a court, the parties
interested have consented to refer the matter to arbitration, and
thereby to have the salvage ascertained; this most certainly they had
not merely the power, but the right to do. If, as is alleged to be the
case, higher rates of allowance have been made, than was required
by the risks and labor encountered in rescuing the property, it only
proves the necessity of creating a tribunal clothed with Government
sanction, that thereby such errors may for the future be prevented
or avoided.
Previous to the treaty which ceded Florida, persons engaged in
wrecking were in the habit of carrying property thus obtained to
New-Providence or to Cuba. They were points which could most
easily be reached—at less expense, and at less hazard; and, of course,
were resorted to, in preference to those which were more distant.
The consequence was, that the revenue of the United States was
thereby impaired. To prevent this, Congress early after the cession


## p. 563 (#581) ############################################

F L Q R J D A T E R R H TO R Y 563
of Florida, passed a law, requiring that all wrecked property should
be brought to the United States, and denouncing against those who
should attempt to carry it beyond our limits, severe forfeitures.
The provisions of this law, were doubtless more readily complied
with, for the reason that the port of Key West, being contiguous to
the point where the wrecks took place, induced no great advantage
in taking the cargoes there; but let Congress, by any embarrassment
thrown in the way, impose the necessity of their proceeding to a
more distant port, or to one where an adjudication cannot readily be
had, and forthwith, will all the property found there be carried
to ports beyond the limits of the United States, to New Providence
or Cuba, to the injury of the revenue, and certainly not to the benefit
of the owners. To prevent this, laws may be passed; but to enforce
and render them effectual, will require all the energies of the Govern-
ment. Over and above this, by a transfer of the cargoes to Nassau
an additional injury will be sustained to the commercial interest, by
diverting the Spanish trade entirely from this section of the country.
Capitalists and capital will always go where profit is to be found, a
law established then, which shall recognise Key West as the point of
resort for the various wrecks that take place along that coast, will
so attract public attention, as that property will always bring its
fair and proper value; and thus every thing of suspected injustice to
owners be avoided. Already considerable capital is centered on the
island, in addition to which, merchants from Havana, only about nine
hours sail, will, as they have usually done, resort there when sales
are about to take place.
In a single year, from December 1824 to December 1825,
$293,353 00, of wrecked property; was sold there and never but in
one instance did it fail to bring nearly its value, some of it going even
beyond its value. Since December, the amount has greatly exceeded
the proportion of the previous year, nor has the sales been of less
value to the owners.—During this time, or rather since October, 1824,
the duties accruing to the Government at Key West, as I have been
informed, have exceeded $100,000 00," most of which would have been
lost to the United States, if by any embarrassments thrown in the way,
the wrecks had been carried to Nassau; and this indeed would have
been the case, if, under the provisions of our law, the wreckers had
been required to proceed to any remote or inconvenient post.
The case alluded to, where the property did not bring its full value,
is that of the brig Hercules, Capt. Seaman, of New York. Of this
I speak with confidence, having been at the Island at the time this
cargo was sold. Respecting this brig, incorrect representations have
*A part of which has been paid away in Debentures [Footnote on the MS.].

been made. She had been wrecked and her cargo brought something
less than $100,000. Insurance had been made upon her cargo for
$208,000. It does not however follow, that it was in fact worth that
sum. Be that as it may, owing to the circumstance of her having
heeled and received a considerable quantity of water into her hold,
some of the most valuable goods on board were materially damaged.
Upon this vessel it is alleged, $72,500 was paid for salvage; this is not
true. The amount received by the wreckers was $25,800 or there-
abouts. Thus, instead of $72,500 as has been represented, a much
less sum was paid, making a difference between the amount imputed,
and that actually paid, of $46,700.
Shortly after the sale Mr. John Searle, agent of the under-writers,
arrived at the Island, and proposed to pay $72,500 to have returned
to him the vessel and cargo as it was when wrecked. P. C. Greene &
Co. acceded to the proposal, and set about to re-purchase the goods,
although they were in the hands of various purchasers, and actually
paid 40 to 50 per cent. advance, in some cases, to obtain them. Some
of them, however, could not be procured, and for this deficiency a
deduction proportional to the sum first offered was made, and the
contract was thus concluded. It is from this eircumstance that the
imputation has obtained currency that $72,500 was allowed for sal-
vage, when, in fact, and in truth, it was the result of arrangement,
and compromise.
One objection to the establishment of a court, is found in letters
insidiously pressed upon Members of Congress from St. Augustine.
Who, let me ask, are the persons who urge these objections? Have
the people met and presented any memorial? Have the merchants
there, who understand the nature and force of business, come forward.
Not at all. It proceeds altogether from one, two, or three emigrant
lawyers, who have gone to Florida in quest of better prospects than
they could find in a fair competition of talents in the States where
they resided. They have discovered, forsooth, that the island is
sickly, that designing men live there, and that the commercial interest
of the country materially demands a change of places for the sale of
wrecked property—and that place is ST. AUGUSTINE.—Now is it not
obvious to every one who will reflect for a moment, that interested
and selfish considerations alone, must influence the writers of those
letters? Bring, if it were possible, the wrecked property to that place,
and of course the lawyers, by their libels and suits, must and will be
benefited: and hence is found the cause of their deep solicitude—
their great exertions for the public good.
In some respects I am connected with the firm of P. C. GREENE &
Co. It is a mercantile house established upon capital, and is in good
credit. The island is partly owned by the firm, who, with a view to

add to its prosperity, have given, rather than sold, lots in the town,
with a view to its improvement. This firm, to be sure, having an
interest, may be benefited by whatever shall conduce to the interest
of the island. Their's however, is an open, not occult interest. They
may be employed as Commission merchants, as has already been the
case. They may purchase wrecked property, and in doing so will
enter into a fair competition with the rest of the world. Beyond these,
they have no interest, and whatever of imputation or suspicion, upon
an interest thus declared may be circulated to their prejudice, is pre-
sumed to be met and over ruled by the substantial reasons which
are here urged in behalf of the proposed measure. The interest of
the commercial part of the community—justice to the wreckers, who
venture their lives and property—and above all, protection on the
part of the Government to the inhabitants of the Island, demand
loudly the adoption of the measure that is asked for by the bill enacted
by the Senate.”

longer than usual, it is Owing to the difficulty of obtaining trans-

would not approve. On my part the returns shall not be delayed.”
I have no recollection that I ever have exceeded in any instance,
the Sum set apart for the Superintendancy, And shall not.
I am Called on by the Department to explain the necessity for the
use of Six horses And a Waggon And by what Authority they have
been purchased
Enclosed is a Copy of my letter to Co" Humphreys of the 7"
January 1826.” The Agency then was about 70 Miles from Tampa
Bay—it is now about 98 Miles. The Supplies for the use of the
Agency are drawn from Tampa Bay, a Waggon and Team was
necessary, but the Agent Could not during the whole year Procure
one. I brought one with me to this Country which the Agent desired
to obtain. Owing to the circumstance of my being the Superintendant
I refused to sell it to him until it was suggested that Capt DE Burch
of the Quarter Masters Department, who was in the habit of procuring
such articles for the Army should value it. This was done. I
submit it to the Secretary either to Approve or reject the purchase,
And if rejected the loss shall be mine—but as the Agency Cannot
be Supported without One (for none can be hired in that quarter) it
will be necessary to purchase another, which will be done unless the
Department direct otherwise.
The other two horses making Six are under my Charge and were
purchased for the Department in the year 1824 at the time the
Indians were removing from this part of the Country, My accounts

GENERAL, When I addressed you from St. Augustine on the 18th
Inst.” in relation to the complaints touching the manner in which
the Road had been opened by M. Bellamy, I had determined to notice
the matter no farther until I should know what steps Major Pierce's
report & my letter would cause you to take. But the receipt of the
papers enclosed, numbered from 2 to 8, (including my letter to Gov"
Duval numbered 1,) renders it necessary both in justice to myself
& to M.” Bellamy that I should take up the subject again. These
papers have been furnished unsolicited by me excepting that of the
Governor. But a volume such might be obtained for asking if I
thought it at all necessary. In fact was the matter left to vote but
few in the Country would, I am persuaded, be found to condemn
the Road. I have learnt recently that my name received no small
share of abuse by persons whom I never saw or heard of, on a report
being circulated that I had rejected the Road to the injury of M"
Bellamy, before I had even inspected it with a view to receiving it.—
Those numbered from 6 to 8,-were forwarded to me from Alachua
County; with these persons I am personally unacquainted but some of
whom are known to me by name & that they support a respectable
character where they reside;—with Colonel Dill however, I have a
personal acquaintance; he is as respectable amanasanyin the Country,

is so completed, the only possible doubt which could arise as to
its construction under the contract, (for I have myself given positive
directions in all the most difficult ponds & places, for making the
Road,) is to what was intended to be meant by the marshy, miry,
& swampy ground, requiring the ditches of 4 feet wide & 3 feet deep.
According to my judgment & my explanation of the Contract when
it was entered into, there is but very little such ground on the whole
route. Can it be supposed for a moment that any man but a madman
would take contracts to open a Road of 212 miles, with a Stipulation
to turnpike more than one hundred miles of low woods with earth
dug from ditches of such dimensions & the whole floored underneath
with timber? or could it be expected that a turnpike Road should be
constructed, numerous streams bridged &c. &c. for four hundred
miles in a Wilderness Country, for the Sum of $.28,000,—? In
truth, so rigidly has the Contractor adhered to my directions in con-
structing the Road, doing much more work in many places than his
contract required, that when it is so finished as that I should be willing
to accept & certify its completion, that the investigation would in
reality rest upon my conduct and not on his work.—
I am informed by Capt. Clark that the road opened by him has
been approved by you upon a report of the manner of its construction.
I have never seen a foot of this Road & have heard only the most
favorable accounts of it, but if comparisons could, or ought, to
determine the correct performance of my own duty, or the faithful
performance of this contract, I would most gladly submit this Road
to the test of the comparison with his, when viewed by competent
judges of such work, regard being had to the Country over which
they have respectively been opened, the amount of labor bestowed on
each; and the way each has been laid out. Both Roads have been
travelled over by Gov" Duval, and his opinion of the one opened by
me is fairly expressed in his letter.—My original intention was after
this Road should have been completed in such manner as I was willing
to receive it, to make to you a detailed report respecting it, describing
the Country &c. &c. leaving the final decision with you as to whether
the Balances of the Payments should be made.—And I firmly believe
that such a course would even yet ensure as much justice to the
Contractor & to the United States as any arbitration which could be
had.—

I enclose a letter from the Mayor of St. Augustine" designating
the point at which it was desired the Road should be brought to the
St. Sebastian's, opposite to the City, & which was accordingly done.
In this case the Contractor made a causeway on the City side of the
River, over the mud, for the more convenient landing of the ferry
Boat, estimated by good judges to be worth $200. for which he
expects to receive no compensation as it was not in his contract nor
required by my instructions.—
As it appears to be the intention of the Government to increase the
road to the full width contemplated by law, I will only remark that
no great practical benefit to the Country or the Road can result from
it, on the Contrary, it will then grow up more rapidly. The direction
being from West to East it will be only used by travelling persons,
for the most part on Horseback, & not for the business of the Country,
hence it will have but a single track; and the open woods of this
Country will allow of wagons passing each other at any point where
they may happen to meet.—But as the law requires it, & most of the
people of the country expect it, I should be pleased to receive an order
to increase its width. If the troops remain at Pensacola, I should
prefer to employ them under my own direction to increase the width,
at least as far as the Appalachicola, if not for the whole route. And
if any part is put out to contract, it ought to be from that River to
St. Augustine, though I would prefer that no part of it should be. If
it is to be done at all I should be pleased to receive my orders immedi-
ately, so as to commence on the 1" of October next, & I think that
by the 31* of March ensuing it would be completed to St: Augustine.
If the fall season is lost for work, nothing of any account can be done
during the winter & spring, & a postponement for the next summer
would necessarily take place. An additional appropriation of $.7500
will be necessary to complete the work in that manner, if done by
the troops, & $.11000, if by contract. It would not require so much
by $.1500 to finish it by the labor of the troops but for the great
scarcity of forage in Florida, which greatly augments the cost of
transportation of supplies. Corn has been worth here throughout
this season $.2.50/100 & $.3, per bushel, & there will be as great
scarcity the next, owing to the demand occasioned by settlers. In
New Orleans & in Pensacola both corn & hay have been equally
scarce & proportionably dear.
As nothing will be done by me in relation to M. Bellamy's contract
until I receive a reply to this letter, I request you will be pleased to
address a duplicate of your answer to me at this place, as well as to
Pensacola. It is my intention to make the contracts for the Coleraine

of the Territory, it must be supposed that you feel as deep an interest
in its improvements as any other person whatever; and of course
would decide upon any public work affecting its prosperity & facilities

interests having biased the expression of an opinion derived from a
free exercise of a sound judgement.—

CAPT. DANIEL E BURCH Asst. Quarter Master. U. Army
SIR Your letter of the 25 int is received, in which you request my
opinion of the road as made by M. John, Bellamy, under his contract,
I have travelled on this road from Gadsden County to Alachua
County a distance of more than one hundred & fifty miles, and do not
hesitate to assert that for the whole distance, considering the low and
swampy situation of much of the ground over which the road passes
that it is decidedly the best new road I have ever seen, when M*
Bellamy shall finish the causways by adding more earth, the road
will be excellent. I do not think the stumps are too high and more
labour has been bestowed on the road than I had expected, knowing
the appropriation was small, for a road so lengthy, -If this work had
not in my judgement, been executed as was expected, I should have
considered it my duty to remonstrate to the War Department.
Many of those who complain of the road no doubt expected to see a
turnpike but as much and in my opinion even more has been done
than I could have believed it was possible to do with the whole appro-
priation for this object.

SIR. An act to provide for the surveying of private claims in
Florida was passed by the H. of Rep" but I very much regret that it
was laid over in the Senate for want of time to Act upon it.”
As it is probable that this bill will be acted upon and become a law
at a very early period of the next Session of Congress, and as little or
no progress can be made in surveying the private claims until Novem-
ber next, and it being somewhat doubtful how far the provisions
of the 13th Section of the Act of 1823 "repeals those of the 6th Section
of the Act of the 8th May 1822,” It may be advisable to suspend all

private land claims in E. Fla. on Apr. 14, 1826 (House Journal, 19 Cong., 1 sess.,
p. 434). Del. White transmitted the bill to George Graham on Apr. 20 with a
request for an amendment providing for surveys (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.,

contracts for the survey of private claims for the present. If however
individuals insist upon having their claims surveyed and connected
with the Township lines at their own expense you may cause such
surveys to be so made, provided they be within the Township lines
that have been run.
I enclose for your information a copy of the bill above referred to
as it was amended and passed the House of Representatives. Under
the provisions of this Act I have no doubt that you would in a very
short period be enabled to complete the whole of the surveys of the
private claims in Florida.”

GENERAL. I had the honor to receive on the 1* Inst. (by the way
of Pensacola from whence it was forwarded,) your letter of the 21"
April "last enclosing one from M Rodman to the Secretary of War."—
And will now endeavor to give you as faithful a report of my proceedure
in opening this Road under the contract with M. Bellamy as is in my
power to do, together with a description of the Country through which
the Route passes; on which together with my letters of the 18" * &
29th Ulto.” I rely for my exculpation from the alledged neglect of
duty as charged by M Rodman. In relation to this Gentleman I
have only to observe that his own character, (with him personally
I have no acquaintance,) as a public officer has not been such as
altogether to free him from reproach, nor is it such in my opinion as
to qualify him for a Censor over the officers of the Government. I
am aware, however, that to impugn the character of others is not the
mode to exculpate myself & I will forbear further remark excepting
this:—That when he was called upon by M* Bellamy to know from
what authority he had derived his information, & why he made the
report; he stated that he had been directed by the Government to

report upon the Road, & that as a public officer he was bound to
comply; and added that his principal ground of complaint was the
narrowness of the Road. This however I take to have ben a rank
falsehood, for I can never believe that M. Barbour would descend to
such a mean system of espionage without some better authority for
the truth of the allegation than M. Rodman's assertion:—He is &
has long been the known deadly enemy of M." Bellamy, & to that
source do I ascribe his report & not to any orders from the Govern-
ment.—Governor Duval's statement in regard to the Stumps, is a
full refutation to the assertion that “they are left standing to a great
height.” And the known fact that the causeways & Bridges of the
Road, in the very worst part of it too, have already stood near a
“twelvemonth,” including an uncommonly & extraordinary wet sea-
son, that of the last winter & spring, in their unfinished & insecure
state, without sustaining the slightest injury is sufficient evidence
of the falsity of the assertion that “they are absolutely good for
nothing.” In truth there are no Creeks of any importance on any
part of the Road opened by M. Bellamy. When M* Rodman stated
“that all travellers agree in stating that the work is done in the
slightest manner possible,” he well knew that he had not given the
opinions of all the travellers, for there were two intelligent men, as
respectable as any in the City of St. Augustine, resident in the place,
who had stated the reverse, & of whom he might have enquired if he
was solicitous to render equal justice to all concerned in his Report,
by presenting the proof on both sides of the question for the considera-
tion of the Secretary of War. Major Pierce informed me that Mr
Rodman, when called upon, stated that he had never seen the Road
himself & gave up two informants only." When the statements of
those two Gentlemen are received, if you should call for either of
them, I trust that as one of them is a Military Officer he may be
required to give a full & detailed report of the Country he passed
through, its general & particular character; and to designate particu-
larly what parts of the work was objectionable, also what Bridges are
spoken of, the streams they are over, size, description, sources, char-
acter &c. &c. When called upon to make a report in this manner he
will find it both more difficult to fix his objections upon particular
places, & to offer his own suggestions in the way of improvements
than to say in general terms, –all is bad, or, all is good. I will
further remark that as the Road was not such as he could travel by
the way of Picolata, when he visited Tallahassee, he did not come
on it at all until he arrived at the St: Fé natural Bridge 85 miles
west of St: Augustine; and from thence to Tallahassee, this report
will shew that two thirds of the way is high dry ridges, or either oak

or Pine woods. Nor had any other person travelled that part of it
at the time when M* Rodman wrote his letter.—
First; as to the Country:—Commencing at the Ocholochonee River
it is high rolling pine Barrens & oak woods to the Aussillee River, a
distance of 41 miles. on this part of the Road there are neither low
grounds nor streams of any importance; and but one that presents
the least obstruction, being a pond drain, full & wide in wet seasons,
but lost in the dry seasons. This has been bridged and causewayed
in the most permanent manner, the causeway being made of logs two
deep in many places, & as the swamp was not suitable for ditching,
the causeway is completely covered with earth carried on to it. The
Swamp was itself a hard sand & but for the water with which it is
flooded in rainy seasons, did not require any Causeway at all. This
work was done exactly according to my positive directions. There
is also a small stream which sinks into the ground just above the Road;
but in very heavy floods of Rain the Sink is insufficient to vent the
water, & it consequently runs over the Road for about 150 yards,
which is here a dry, sandy, Hammock; and even when fullest, which
rarely occurs & then never lasts more than two or three days, pre-
sents no serious obstruction to passing it with carriages or wagons.—
It would not have been proper to make a raised Causeway through
this Hammock, for it could only have served to dam up the water to
a greater height, when it would have had to vent itself over the
Causeway, tearing it to pieces in such a manner, each freshet, as to
render it impracticable until repaired. This place has been com-
pleted under my directions & much work is done that could not have
been required of the Contractor, for there is no miry ground in any
part of the Hammock. Likewise at the Aussillee River, the whole
way through the swamp, (or rather Hammock for it is not a swamp,)
has been ditched and thrown up, though the whole was a firm hard
white sand, without the least appearance of marsh or mire. At this
River I directed a ferry flat to be built & a ferry established in lieu of
the Bridge, because I found by long experience & knowledge of the
River that it was the only sure means of passing it at all seasons.—
This River is not fed by springs, but is the outlet of extensive ponds
& Savannahs, hence in very dry seasons it is an insignificant looking
stream, sometimes fordable at the ferry even, but in time of heavy
Rains it is swoln into a large River, & at such times after crossing
the Bridge, the traveller would have found swimming water for more
than a quarter of a mile through the low grounds. The selection of
the Route on this Section of the Road has been along the highest
ridges, avoiding the small ponds & steep declivities, meeting alto-
gether my fullest approbation.—


## p. 576 (#594) ############################################

576 T E R H I TO R J A L PA P E H S
Second:—From the Ausillee River to the Suwannee River, a distance
of 42 miles, the land is in general low flat pine woods, (with occasional
ridges,) of hard, firm, sand, spotted with numerous ponds & grassy
places, through which it was with great difficulty that a Road could
be selected at all.—The low and grassy places of this section have
been ditched & thrown up, and The largest of the Ponds, (of which
there were three very large & deep) on this part of the Road have
been causewayed with timber in a permanent manner, the whole
covered with earth carried on to them, for in such places it was
impracticable to ditch, the earth being a firm, hard, & fine sandy
bottom, in many places two feet under water. Two attempts were
made to causeway the two largest of these ponds, without succeeding,
owing to the quantity of water in them; & by one of those attempts
the Contractor lost two months work of all his hands, in consequence
of my having directed them to be brought away from another & distant
section of the Road where it was dry & where they were at work;—
just at the moment they commenced at the Ponds, a heavy rain set
in & rendered their efforts to work fruitless. The causeways in these
ponds have been constructed according to my directions and are
permanent, being raised by layers of large logs above the water &
covered with earth. About six miles west of the Suwannee, there are
two creeks & one pond drain, breaking through the high pine woods
like artificial canals, the largest of which is not in common times ten
feet wide, but which in heavy Rains raise to a very full height. These
are Bridged. This Section of the Road was the most difficult from
Pensacola to St: Augustine. The selection of the route through it
& the construction of the Road itself, are much better than I had ever
expected them to be.—In fact it is such a Road that unless in un-
commonly wet seasons, when it is by no means difficult, it is as easy
for carriages to pass over as the highest pine Barrens or Oak woods
on the whole route.—
Third;—From the Suwannee to a point eight miles East of the
St. Fé Natural Bridge, a distance of 52 miles in all, the whole way is
on dry Sand Hills, and needed nothing but to be opened. The growth
is scattering pine, & the ground almost destitute of herbage. For the
first 48 miles of this section there is not a stream nor a Rod of low
grounds for the Road to cross, the greatest difficulty is want of water
for the traveller to drink, there being none except in Limestone Sinks
& that very scarce indeed. This is as handsome a stretch of straight
Road as I have ever seen in any Country.—At the St: Fé natural
Bridge, it is sometimes interrupted by very high waters when the sink
is not sufficient to vent the water & it flows over the lowest part of the
ground. In this place I have caused a dam to be thrown up in what
is apparently high dry woods, of near six feet high, with a good foot

F L Q R J D A T E H R H TO R Y 577
way along side of it raised wholly out of reach of water. This work
was done by my directions, was very considerable, and is wholly out of
reach of the Contract; but no objections were made by the Contractor
to performing it when required by me to do so.
Fourth:—From thence to St: Augustine, a distance of 77 miles, the
Country is in general flat, not however without occasional extensive
dry Ridges, some of them being very high ranges of Sand Hills. The
flat woods is spotted with almost innumerable ponds & low grassy
places. all the low places in this part of the route which could require
it, & even more according to the letter of my directions, have been
ditched & thrown up; +h like Haahher and East of the St: John's River
near one fourth of the whole way has been ditched & thrown up. In
like manner a Causeway or landing place for the ferry Boat has been
made on the City side of the St. Sebastians River worth in labor at
least $.200, neither required by the Contract nor by my directions.
It is certainly very useful now that it is made, but it was by no means
necessary in my opinion, particularly if a Bridge is to be built over
the River. Through this route there are no creeks, but some occa-
sional pond drains of no importance, & dry, excepting in Rainy
Seasons.—
These flat woods or pine Glades throughout Florida along the route
of the Road, are much subject to being covered with water, but they
are not the more difficult of being travelled over on that account, as
they are uniformly of hard, white, sand equally firm & clear of bogging
in wet as in dry seasons. Boggy ground is only to be found in Florida
among the high sand hills; & there, in wet seasons, the hollow places
are absolutely impassable if a step is taken out of the beaten trail or
Road.—
In regard to the Stumps, they were directed by me to be cut hollow-
ing into the Centre; for, according to the experience of others more
versed in such matters than myself, added to my own observation, it
greatly facilitates their being rotted out by the retention of the Rain &
moisture; and this very circumstance now makes them appear higher
than they really are. If scarfed off on the outsides they would appear
to be cut very low down.—My directions were to cut them where the
swell of the roots is joined to the trunk of the tree, which is as low as
I thought necessary & is as low as I ever saw any cut. If they had
been cut lower, it would have been the easiest method for the Con-
tractor to have dug up the trees entirely by the Roots. I can assert
with truth that there is not a Stump left in the whole Road, not even
from the largest trees, which could obstruct the passage over it of the
lowest constructed Carriage now in use.—
In regard to the Causeways I have to state that they are both per-
manently & fully made so as to be passed now as easily and as safely


## p. 578 (#596) ############################################

578 T E H P J T Q R J A L PA. P.E. R. S.
as they ever will be, but they are not finished in such a manner as that
I am satisfied with them either with the quantity of dirt carried on to
them, or in their being secured by riders staked over them. And the
Bridges are not covered with such planks or puncheons as I require.
The main object which I have always kept in view is now accomplished,
to have the Road opened & placed in travelling order throughout its
extent, without stopping the progress of the work to dwell upon un-
important particulars; and the Contractor is now at work with all his
hands completing the Road under my directions, as was always his
intention to do.—
The Contract itself under which M* Bellamy worked merits some
remark, in the way of explanation, from me. By your orders I
required that the Contractor should work wholly under my directions,
which is fully & repeatedly expressed under the severe penalty of an
entire forfeiture if he failed so to do. Under such a stipulation it
was necessary for him to know the utmost limits to which I should go
with such directions; hence the precise stipulations respecting the
depth & width of the ditches, to be dug in Swampy, miry, & Marshy
ground; the width & manner of securing the Causeways; & the mode
of constructing the Bridges. I have frequently deviated from the
exact letter of the contract in the ditches at the Causeways, for it
would have been absurd to require a ditch to be dug where it was
wholly useless, merely because the contract so expressed it;-the
only object in having ditches at all at the Causeways was to obtain
earth sufficient to cover the poles & timber of which they were made.
But on the other side of the question under the same stipulation, I
have required a great deal of work to be done on the Road more than
was expressed in the contract, as for instance, in ditching & throwing
up certain places in the low sandy, pine woods,-This ditching &
throwing up presents now only banks of fine white sand, soft &
unpleasant to travel over; & if the Road was to be examined now that
it is an uncommonly dry season, by persons unacquainted with the
real situation of the Country, it would appear that the whole of that
kind of work was wholly useless, as well as many of the Causeways, &
all the Bridges that have been built; so perfectly firm & hard is the
way throughout.—
In seleeting constructing this Road I have spared no pains in select-
ing the best route, & according to my judgement in directing how the
work should be done; and as I would answer on my conscience before
my God I have never spared the Contractor in his work, of which he
has frequently complained to me, though never to others, to my
knowledge. And I have no hesitation in saying that although in
some places, I might with troops, have made the work of smoother
appearance, yet it would not have been more permanent in its char-

acter; and also that the Contractor has in many places done work in
ditching & throwing up, that I should have wholly passed over with
troops.—This Road has been four several times inspected by me
during its progress, viz: in May, & in September 1825; and in February,
& at the present time, of this year. At the first inspection made, if
I had not found that the work was not going on well I would have
most certainly stopped all further proceedings, both to save the
Contractor from a useless expenditure of time & labor; & that the
United States might not have the final completion of the work de-
layed by his incompetency to perform the work properly. The
manner in which the Road has been laid out, & the selection of the
ground would have done him credit, if there had been nothing else to
recommend his work, in the opinions of persons competent to judge
of such matters, & who were also acquainted with the general face of
the Country through which it passes.—
And I now repeat that when the Road is finished so as that I am
willing to receive it & certify that it is completed according to the
Contract & my directions, it will no longer be a question affecting
the Contractor or his contract; but a decision as to whether I have
opened the Road according to the views of the Government or not.
I will not therefore disguise from you the fact, General, that although
I have requested another person to be appointed to inspect this Road
when it is completed; yet if you are satisfied with, and approve of
my conduct in relation to this Road upon receiving my reports of
the 18" & 29* Ulto. and the documents enclosed therein, taken
together with this letter, it would be infinitely more grateful to my
feelings that the inspection & receipt of the Road should still be left
with me; but if you determine otherwise I shall be perfectly content
to acquiesce in your decision. There is no duty to perform, in the
range of the duties of Quarter Master, that could possibly have
exposed his conduct to more animadversion than this of opening
Roads where there were so many conflicting interests & opinions
brought to bear upon the officer & his work; to say nothing of the
evil-minded whose only delight is to vilify others. If superceded in
any manner whatever at this moment, it will be immediately said that
it was for misconduct & I shall be made to suffer when conscious of
having never swerved from my duty. The Road will be completed
about the first of august if the rains should not set in so violently as
to prevent it.—The Contractor has labored under many difficulties
& suffered many delays in his work in consequence of the very un-
commonly rainy year last past. It is perfectly within my knowledge
that there has never been a suitable time for opening the Road,
with any economy of work, through the low pondy country from the

time the Contract was entered into until the first of March last; and
the Country is now as dry as it has been heretofore wet.—
Through the whole route from this place to St. Augustine the
Country is, after passing the Aussillee, a barren wilderness, & no
point of it afforded supplies. Hence instead of paying $.16,000, on
these Contracts, if it had been opened by the troops, on so long a
line of land transportation as it necessarily is from St. Marks East-
wardly, the extra expenses alone for the troops would have amounted
to upwards of $.20,000,—on the closest & most economical calculation
that I can make. Any Contractor under ordinary circumstances
must have been ruined under the contract, but M* Bellamy had his
own provisions, teams, & negroes.—
I have from the present case learnt one lesson for life on the subject
of contracts;—never again to undertake the superintendence of the
execution of a work under a contract, but to leave the whole of the
operations to the Contractor, & let his work be judged of when com-
pleted, under the letter of the Contract, and by that alone.—
I enclose herewith a paper containing a summary of the instructions
I have from time to time given the Contractor relating to the manner
of performing his work; * and which in all cases has been adhered
to.—
I request General you will please to address a Duplicate of your
reply to this letter," & of your orders in consequence, to me at this
5 Present.
* No reply found. See the Quartermaster General to the Secretary of War,
Nov. 21, 1826 (NA, WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 10, printed, A. S. P., Mil. Affairs,
III, 343), of which the following paragraphs are pertinent: “The road to communi-
cate between Pensacola and St Augustine in Florida, authorized by an act of
Congress of the 28th of February 1824, has been completed—It is about four
hundred miles in length and has been made sixteen feet wide throughout. The
act referred to authorized a road twenty five feet wide, but the sum appropriated
being less than two fifths of the estimate, it become a question whether only a
part of the road should be completed, or the amount appropriated be applied to
the opening of a communication between the points indicated, of less width, but
sufficient for military purposes—The latter was thought most advisable by your
predecessor; and I was accordingly instructed to cause the road to be opened six-
teen feet wide. Should it be thought necessary to increase the width the work
might be done by the troops at a comparatively trifling expense, but I should
consider the utility of the measure somewhat problematical—the road is at present
sufficiently wide and well constructed for all military purposes—and certainly so
as it regards the use to be made of it by the inhabitants of Florida.
“The road from Tampa Bay in Florida to Colerain in Georgia has been com-
pleted by the troops from the former place to Wantons about one hundred and
twenty miles—A detachment under direction of Capt Clark of the Quarter
Masters Department is employed on the section of that road extending from
Wantons to Black Creek a branch of St John’s river which it is believed they will

JAMES GADSDEN TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:ALS]
WAS-CESSA June 5, 1826
SIR I have just received your letter of the 2" of May," and though
exposed to the imputation of having acted under the honest convic-
tions of a deceptive judgement; I see no reason in your report or the
evidence on which it was founded to change the opinion expressed by
me of the capacity of the country as originally defined to sustain the
Indians intended to be located on it—The Governors report on the
subject” is founded on a partial examination of a very limited portion
of the district set apart for the Indians, and Mr Chairs acknowledges
in his statement he has seen but a very small part of the country—
It is not however to maintain opinions expressed, or so much to
prevent any extension of territory to the Indians if deemed necessary
by the Executive, as to guard you against a too confident reliance on
the supposed cause of past distresses among the savages of Florida,
that I again address you on this subject—The Indians have always
been in possession of a greater extent of land than that defined in the
Treaty, and they now have had yielded to them what they themselves
acknowledge fully equal to their support—If too much reliance there-
fore is placed on this single fact as an atonement for the past, and a
guarantee for the future, I apprehend we may defer untill too late the
only corrective to the irregularities which have been, and will be con-
tinued to be committed by our Red Neighbors—I am not unwilling to
deny that the ordinary (and in this case probably the extraordinary,
embarrassments incident to a removal to a new country, have not been
without their agency in producing much of the distresses reported
Creek to Coleraine a distance of fifty six miles was put under contract in July
last—the Contractors have stipulated to complete it by the 31st of December;
and I have every assurance they will fulfil their contracts. . . .” See post,

among the Indians; but their principal sufferings may be traced to other
causes which will continue, when the former, greatly diminished by
the extension of territory of a superior quality, are removed—It is to
these causes that I would direct your particular attention and which
are to be traced to the peculiar character of the Indians among us—
I beg you to seriously consider their origin, the dis-cordant and restless
materials which are united in the composition of their population, and
their whole history, for it is only upon a thorough knowledge of these
that any system can be successfully put in operation, to check their
future irregularities, bring them under proper subordination and
ameliorate their condition—I regret the necessity of intruding upon
you any further correspondence on this subject, and though the opin-
ions expressed may have very little influence on the policy, the Presi-
dent may determine to pursue, yet it ought not to deter me (from my
past agency in our Indians affairs and from the known exposed situa-
tion of some of the settlements in Florida), from placing at your dis-
posal the information my opportunities have enabled me to collect &

most essential service in warning vessels of approaching danger.
Four ships lately have been entirely indebted to the warnings of the
bells of the light vessel. Employment for the wreckers diminishes
daily, and some of them have left the wrecking ground.
The Bahama Turtlers who have heretofore occupied the Florida
coast in pursuit of that employment, to the number of twenty or
thirty vessels, have been turned off by Capt. Doane, so that this
lucrative branch of business, is reserved exclusively for American
enterprize.
This is a just measure. No American dare approach the West
Indian coasts without being subject to seizure; and while we are
excluded from the benefits of fishing on British ground, it would be
unjust for them to occupy ours.

Laborde, consisting of 4 heavy Frigates, Sloop of War and Gun Brig,

SIR, Circumstances have rendered it necessary to substitute you
for Captain Burch, in the duty of inspecting the roads opened by Mr
Bellame and others associated with him, under Contracts with Capt
Burch, of the 21" Decem" 1824 for the section extending from the
Ocholochony river to the St Johns,” and of the 28th of September
last, for the section lying between the latter river and St Augustine"—
You will, therefore, repair, as early as practicable to Tallahassee
where you will meet Capt Burch and Mr. Bellame.
Captain Burch has been instructed to furnish you with one set of
the original contracts which are in his possession, and to accompany
you in the course of your inspection "-explaining the contracts
wherever they may appear doubtful or ambiguous, and rendering you
every assistance not incompatible with a strict neutrality on his
part.—
You will find the contracts long, but sufficiently explicit, it is
believed, to enable you to comprehend them clearly. You will give

respects, for your guide—endeavoring, to the best of your ability,
to render justice to the contractors, at the time that you guard the
rights and interests of the public."
Should you accept the road in its present state, as complying with
the conditions of the contracts, you will give the contractors certifi-
cates to that effect—If it be found defective, and they acquiesce in
your decision as to the work necessary to be done to render it accept-
able, you will urge them to its immediate completion and remain in
the vicinity with a view to a final inspection: and if they disagree
with you as to present dificiencies, the umpire must be immedi-

THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL TO JOHN BELLAMY
[NA:WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 9]
June 10th 1826.
JN° BELLAME Esq Tallahasse Flo.
SIR, I received, yesterday your letter of the 19* ulto,” on the
subject of the roads opened by you in Florida, under contracts with
Capt. Burch, and have, in compliance with your request, which had
been preceeded by a similar one from Capt Burch, determined to re-
lieve him from the delicate responsibility, which, under existing
circumstances would attach to him, in the duty of inspecting and
receiving those roads.
Captain Isaac Clark, Assistant Q Master at Tampa Bay, and who
has some experience in respect to roads, has been appointed to make
the inspection, and is ordered to repair to Tallahassee, as early as
practicable, with a view to the immediate performance of this duty,
where he is advised he will meet both yourself and Capt Burch.
As there are other individuals besides yourself, parties to the first
contract, it will be necessary, in order to provide against any after
objections to Capt Clark's decisions, that a formal agreement should
be signed, substituting him for Capt Burch, in regard to the inspection
under the contract.
In making this arrangement, it is understood, that Capt Clark
merely takes the place of Captain Burch, for the single purpose of
inspecting and receiving the roads—the necessity of your appointing
a person to act with him is therefore, not seen. Should you and him
disagree in opinion, as to the defects, if any, of the roads when offered
for inspection, the fifth article of the first contract which is adopted
in the second, prescribes the course to be pursued—and it is deemed
proper not to deviate from this prescription, though your proposition
is, in every other view, unobjectionable.
I have instructed Capt Clark, in the performance of the duty
assigned to him, to take the contracts for his guide, and to endeavor,
whilst he guards the public interest, to do you justice. I hope there
will be no disagreement between you ultimately, as to the work still
necessary to render the roads conformable to the terms of the con-
tracts—but if there should be, it is expected that the umpire which the
contracts provide for, will be forthwith appointed, and his decision,
if it impose additional work on you, speedily executed. Captain

[NA:TD, ST, Lets. to and from Collectors: C]
Copy ST: AUGUSTINE 10* June 1826.
SIR, The sloop Splendid, Captain Johnson of New York, Seized by
Capt: Doane on this Coast for a violation of the revenue laws, going
with an enrolment and license on a wrecking voyage within the
Spanish dominions, has arrived here, and has been libeled in the
Superior Court of this district. The trial is fixed for the 26" Inst:
The Court has appointed M. Cornell, a young gentleman of the bar
her to act as District attorney until the gentleman appointed by the
President arrives. I have drawn the libel myself and shall assist
him in the prosecution but I deem it advisable to employ additional
Counsel, and presume that a moderate charge for Counsel fees, in
case of condemnation would be allowed by the Government, out of
the property Sold. There will be no fee paid, if no condemnation
take place. Please let me Know if such a charge would be allowed.
The portion of the fee which I think ought to be charged to the United
States will be fifty dollars. Capt: Doane will probably agree to
allow fifty dollars more. And one hundred is the least that (I can
expect)—any lawyer of talents and respectability would take as a
compensation in a case of this nature. The vessel seized is estimated
to be worth about $2.000 *—
As the transactions at Key West in regard to the wrecking business
have produced much sensation in the Sea ports of the United States
where insurance had been effected on the property wrecked, and
saved by the wreckers, and as many facts have come to my Knowledge
evincing the irregularity and inequity of many of those transactions,
I take the liberty to invite the attention of the Government to this
Subject. I am perfectly convinced that no advantage has resulted,
and none can result to the government, by the making of Key West a

port of Entry. It has been the means of giving encouragement and
protection to every species of smuggling, and to admit every Kind
of depredations upon fair and regular commerce.
I take the liberty to refer you to a communication on this Subject
published in the East Florida Herald of the 30th of last month signed
Amicus Floridae, one of the numbers of which paper I sent to you
by the last mail. The facts stated in that article have been confirmed
to me by persons entitled to credit. M. Simonton's address, to which
that article was answer, is full of errors and misrepresentations.
The facts mentioned in a note to the communication respecting
the Smuggling of the Quicksilver, is undoubtedly true; and it was
done in a manner almost openly under the eyes of the Collector or
some of his officers. Capt: Johnson the master of the Sloop now under
Seizure here has informed me, that he was at Key West at the time
of the arrival of the Spanish Ship Tarantula there, and saw all the
quicksilver landed from that vessel. It was immediately carried
over to the Havana. The business was conducted by a person who
had been previously employed in the custom house but had for some
cause or other not Known recently left that employment. He was
Known to be worth nothing before this transaction took place, but
soon afterwards boasted that he was worth $20,000—He has since
gone to the North. Capt: Johnson was unwilling to give me his
name. I have reason however to believe that his name is James B.
Lauring, and the same person sailed from Key West as master of a
small schooner called the Mary M°Coy which touched at this port
on the 16" of January last, hence went to Charleston and thence to
New York. I suspect he has returned to this Coast on a wrecking
voyage. When he was here I had not heard of this affair. There
can be no doubt that smuggling is carried on very extensively at
Key West as well in regard to wrecked goods subject to duty, as to
Colonial produce introduced from the Havana. I do not Know
that the Collector of that port, when there himself, is deficient in
vigilance, but he is often absent for a long time, and he has not had
good officers under him. He has lately appointed a gentleman by
the name of Fry (who was a clerk of our Legislative Council during
the last Session) as Deputy Collector, M. Pinkney himself intending
soon to leave the Island, and to be absent for a considerable time. Mr
Fry was recommended to him by Col: Walton, the Secretary of this
Territory, who also holds the Commission of Auctioneer for the Island
of Key West, granted to him by the Governor of this Territory,
though never nominated as the law requires to the Legislative Council.
Mr Fry, for aught I Know may be well qualified for the discharge
of the duties of Deputy Collector at Key West, but I was not a little

surprised te at his name lately, as one of the arbitrators, in a wrecking
case which came under the operation of the new System of Arbitration
adopted on that Island. Capt: Johnson declares that it will be impos-
sible to prevent smuggling at Key West, unless an Inspector of ap-
proved honesty and courage, should be stationed at every ten paces
all round the Island; that boats laden with colonial produce from the
Havana, may easily land any goods in every part of the Island. I
take the liberty with great respect, to suggest for your Consideration,
as a partial remedy for this evil, that orders be sent to the Collectors
of the Atlantic ports, directing them to admit no goods of any de-
scription to be brought from Key West, without a special, and detailed
certificate of transportation accompanying them certified by the
collector of that port. The ordinary coasting manifests with a
general oath and certificate endorsed on them, are in my opinion,
altogether insufficient, with respect to goods shipped from that Island,
to guard against frauds upon the revenue. Under the present regu-
lations at all the Custom houses particular certificates of transporta-
tion are Sent only with merchandise intended to be exported for the
benefit of drawback. It is the easiest thing in the world to ship
from Key West, for Charleston, Baltimore or New York, a large
quantity of sugar and coffee which may have been Smuggled into
that Island, under a general coasting manifest with scarsely any
risk of detection it may be landed on its arrival at any port in the
United States. There is not one man in a hundred that cares a Straw
about custom house oaths. Besides, let it be recollected that only
the oath of the Master of the vessel is required to these coasting
manifests and he only swears to the best of his Knowledge and belief,
that the duties have been paid or Secured. The owner as shipper of
the goods, makes no oath whatever. I have no doubt that the four
fifths of the coffee and sugar sent from Key West to Charleston have
never paid a cent of duty to the U.S.—With respect to drawbacks,
it appears from the report lately made to the House of Representatives,
in answer freña to a call for an account of the revenue collected at
Key West, that a very large portion of the amount of duties collected
there in 1824 was represented by drawback, and it is deserving of
consideration whether there have not been some errors committed
in this matter.
Captain Doane of the revenue cutter Marion has assured me that
to his certain Knowledge drawback has been allowed on goods ex-
ported from Key West to Havana. The Collector may have mistaken
the law on this subject.
I hope you will excuse this long letter but before I close it permit
me to observe that the cutter Marion is of much too large a draught of
water to be of much service on this coast. She cannot approach the

reefs, but at a considerable distance, and could not pursue any small
vessel close along the Coast, engaged in Smuggling or in the violation
of the Slave acts. The cutter Florida which was previously on this
coast draws only Six feet water is a fast sailor and is much better cal-
culated to cruise among the Florida Keys and along our Coast. I think
it would be highly beneficial to the revenue, and well worth the ex-
pense, to have a Small tender, of light draught of water, that would not
cost above One thousand dollars, to accompany the Cutter, and go
among the Keys and on the reefs, and to be ready to cummunicate
frequently with this port. The iniquitous proceedings which have
for some time past been carried on at Key West, cannot continue long.
Congress will I humbly conceive, at the next Session, be sensible of
the propriety of abolishing the custom house there, and should that
event take place, almost all the wreckers will come here with the
goods saved from shipwreck. Indeed the numerous suits lately
brought by the insurance Companies in New York against one of these
men, will convince them that their only Security for a fair and reason-
able salvage is the adjudication of a Court of admiralty.

TO, THE HON* RICHARD RUSH Secretary of the Treasury Wash-
ington.
P. S. Since writing the foregoing I have received Some further
information in regard to the object for which the Schooner John
Richard has Sailed frena for Nassau and I have now but little doubt
that it is an expedition to bring Slaves into this Territory. The
number I understand is about one hundred and that instead of their
being landed (as was at first conjectured would take place) on this
Coast, they will probably be carried to the coast along the gulph of
Mexico and put on shore somewhere between Tampa Bay and St.
Marks. The father of one of the persons presumed to be engaged in
this affair, resides near Tallahassee and is well Calculated to afford
every facility to the enterprise. Indeed I doubt whether a Single
individual could be found at Tallahasse who would throw any obstacle
in the way of its accomplishment, afterwards or in aid in the detention
of the offence. It will be a very easy matter after these slaves are
landed to spread them in the interior of the Country, and gradually
afterwards dispose of them as the owners may see fit. I greatly fear
that there is but little chance of the vessels being intercepted on her
voyage on her approach to any part of the shore of the gulph of
Mexico between the points I have mentioned for it will probably be
too late to send any effectual orders to the Commanders of any of
the armed vessels of the United States at Pensacola or Mobile; and it

will be equally impracticable for the Marion to go round to the gulph
in time to be of any use. However the vessel sent on this expedition
may possibly, by some cause or other, be detained at Nassau, for a
longer time than those concerned in the enterprise calculate; And upon
that presumption, it may still be advisable to despatch orders to some
of the commanders of the armed vessels of the U. States at Pensacola
to Cruise along the Coast of the gulph in search of this vessel.

SIR. We have seen published in the National Journal an Act of
Congress giving the right of pre-emption in lands to certain Settlers
in Florida.”
Foreseeing many difficulties and embarrassments, which will prob-
ably arise in carrying this law in to effect, and perceiving that it is

based on a former Act of Congress entitled an Act giving the right
of pre-emption in the purchase of lands to certain settlers in the
Illinois Territory passed Feb. 5* 1813,” we have deemed it expedient
to ask some information with regard to the proceedings had under the
last mentioned act.
It appears from the Law that the Register and Receiver are made
the Judges of the rights of individuals accruing under this act, we
would respectfully enquire the manner in which the evidence in behalf
of the claimants should be taken. Whether it should only be de-
livered verbally by the Witnesses in the presence of the Receiver and
Register, or whether it should be reduced to writing and a report
thereof made to the department.
The 1* Section of this act provides “that every person or the legal
representatives of any person &c” shall be entitled to the right of
pre-emption in certain cases, and under certain conditions. It also
provides, “that no more than one Q Section of Land shall be sold to
any one individual in virtue of this Act.” We would here enquire
first, what is understood at the Department by the words “one Q”
Section,” do they mean the one fourth part of an entire Section, or
may they be construed so as to signafy two contiguous and adjoining
eights of different Sections? This is a question of considerable im-
portance both to the Government and to individuals.
We would next enquire whether the same person can enter one
quarter section by virtue of his own Settlement and cultivation, and
an other quarter Section as the “legal Representative” or assignee
of an other person. We will here State the case as it will most fre-
quently occur. In the year 1822 A, improved a Q Section, in 1823
he sold his improvement to B, who in 1824 improved an other Q"
Section himself, is B entitled to a pre-emption in both the quarter
Section which he improved and the one he purchased from A. If he
be entitled to both in what manner and form should the one he
purchased from A be entered so as to designate it from the one he
himself improved, and make it conformable to the proviso of the 1"
Section of the Act of 1813, which prohibits the entry of more than
one Q Section of Land by the same individual. We request to be
informed generaly of the proceedings under the Act of 1813.
We have the honour to be Very Respectfully Your Obt Sv"

[NA:WD, QMG Reg. of Contracts, Bk. 2]
[July 1, 1826]
Construction of a Road.
Captain Daniel E. Burch, Asst. Qr. Master of the Army of the
United States, with Francis J. Ross and Davis Floyd, of Florida:
Articles of Agreement made and entered into this first day of July,
1826, between Francis J. Ross of Duval County, and Davis Floyd of
St. Johns' County in the Territory of Florida, of the one part, and
Captain Daniel E. Burch, Assistant Q Master of U. S. Army, Agent
for the United States of America of the other part, Witnesseth:
Article First.—The said Francis J. Ross and Davis Floyd, for and
in consideration of the sum of Nineteen hundred and twenty dollars,
hereafter to be paid to the said Francis J. Ross, his heirs, executors,
&" has, and doth agree to the following conditions: for the faithful
performance of which they hereby bind themselves, their heirs,
executors, &" in the penal sum of Nineteen Hundred and Twenty
Dollars.
Article Second.—The parties to the first part hereof, agree to open
and construct a Road from the ferry on Black Creek in Florida,
(which will be ither Hogan's or Branning's, at my election to be
designated hereafter) on the nearest and best route by “Gravelly
Hill” to the “King's Road” in Florida, to intersect it at or near
“Six Mile Creek Bridge” so that the point of intersection shall be to
the southward of said Bridge, but as near to it as the nature of the
Country will permit.” The route for the Road is to be opened and
constructed in straight reaches twenty feet wide throughout; the
trees to be cut so low as that the stumps shall not present any obstruc-
tion to Carriages passing over them; all timber, brushwood, and other
impediments, to be cleared out and removed therefrom; and holes in
the ground to be filled up and levelled. All marshy, miry, swampy
ground, of a boggy nature is to be causewayed with logs or poles cut
fifteen feet in length, to be secured at the sides with riders firmly
staked down, and to be covered with dirt to a sufficient depth to
render them a smooth Road, dug either from ditches alongside or

St. Mary's River, (where it is crossed by the “King's Road” in Florida,) to a
point near to, and south of “Six Mile Creek Bridge” on said “King's Road”—

carried on to them. The low, Savannah ground of a miry nature,
is to be ditched and thrown up so as to make a firm good road. All
branches, Streams, Creeks, or lagoons that are swimming at any time
whatever for horses, or such as have boggy bottoms and banks, are
to be bridged with good substantial bridges, built of durable and
lasting timber, the flooring to be ither of plank or sawed puncheons;
and built so high and to be out of the reach of being swept off by
freshets. Such small branches or streams as have firm, sandy bottoms
and banks, that are never full to swimming for horses, may be left
as fords, the banks to be properly dug down. In the causeways, or
in places where the ground is ditched and thrown up, requiring a
passage to be left for the drain of the water, either open ground sewers,
or hollow sewers, are to be constructed of logs or poles of suitable size.
Article Third.—The parties to the first part hereof do agree to
complete said Road and to have it ready for delivery to the party of
the second part, or his legal successors in Office, on or before the 31*
of December, 1826.
Article Fourth.—It is mutually agreed by the contracting parties,
that when the said Road is reported to said Burch as being ready for
delivery, that either he, or his legal successor in office, shall imme-
diately thereafter attend for the purpose of inspecting it; and further,
that previous to its being received, it shall be then inspected in the
presence of the said parties, by two disinterested persons; one of
whom to be appointed by said party of the first part, and one by the
said party of the second part; these two having authority to appoint
a third person to decide and settle any difference of opinion arising
between them, regarding the work done, having reference to this
contract; and upon the certificate of these Commissioners, or of any
two of them in case of the appointment of a third, that the road is
opened and constructed according to this contract, the party to the
second part hereof, as agent for the U. States, stipulates that the said
Road shall be received, and that payment of the said sum of Nineteen
Hundred and twenty dollars, shall be made to the said Francis J.

PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT BY INHABITANTS OF
DUVAL COUNTY
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:DS **]
- [July 4, 1826]
To The President of the United States.
We the undersigned inhabitants of Duval County, in Florida beg
leave respectfully to request the attention of your Excellency to the
present situation of the Indians within this Territory. It is known
to your Excellency that a treaty was concluded with these Indians
in 1823,” defining certain limits within which they were to be con-
centrated early in 1824; and that subsequently a survey and sale of
the lands, in part, on which they had resided was made. We had
reasonably calculated that this measure would have been carried
into effect and the Indians removed from among the settlers; but we
have the mortification to find that large numbers of them have been
constantly suffered to roam through our settlements without control,
killing up our Stock of cattle and hogs and pulling corn from the
fields for their subsistence: we have submitted to these depredations
and injuries a long time under the hope that our rights and privileges
as citizens of the United States, in the undesturbed possession of
our own property, would not be utterly overlooked and neglected;
and now finally beg leave to represent to your Excellency that unless
something effectual be done shortly in our behalf, by the concentration
of the Indians within their own boundaries, necessity will compel
us, for the preservation and rightful enjoyment of our hard-earned
possessions in the wilderness to resort to means within our own
strength. and And resources for restraining the excesses of these
Indians; and moreover, of punishing them in a summary manner
when caught in the fact of depredating upon our own property.—For
losses already sustained and such as may occur in future we shall
confidently look to the justice of the Goverment for indemnity and
remuneration *

laid before the President.

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE, July 9" 1826.
GENERAL, I have the honor to report that I have made contracts
for opening the Road from St. Mary's River to Black Creek,” which
are enclosed herewith; also copies of all the proposals received, and
of the advertisement on which they are based.* The terms are very
reasonable & will cost less than if I had hired hands to work under
my own superintendence. The contracts are taken by men living
on the line of Road; one residing at Gravelly Hill, & one near Jackson-
ville, (which last place is six miles from “Six mile creek”, at the cross-
ing of the “King's Road” on the St. John's River, and six miles from
Gravelly Hill,) hence they could perform the work cheaper than
others. The contract made on the “King's Road” will complete so
much of it towards St. Augustine; comprising nearly one half of the
whole distance & more than one half of the entire labor. In making
these contracts I have Stipulated for the full width that can ever be
intended for the Road to be made, in order to save future work on it,
or dissatisfaction as to the width:—the “King's Road” to be 25 feet
wide, & the remaining part 20 feet wide. From the failure of the
bill making additional appropriations for Roads in Florida I am
aware that the amounts contracted for on this will exceed (added to
the expenses of the troops about to work under Capt. Clark,) the
amount of money appropriated, but it is now too late to retract;
and in any event I should have considered your order as imperative
upon me to have the road opened. Moreover, the present reduced
price of cotton operates so favorably on labor that these contracts
are highly advantageous to the Government—The proposals will

* The advertisement asked for proposals for constructing the road from Camp
Pinckney on the St. Marys River to Black Creek, the road to be divided into
two sections, the first extending from the St. Marys to Six Mile Creek and the
section from the latter point to Black Creek. The following proposals are present:

shew the various estimates placed upon the value of the labor to be
performed by the different Individuals proposing.
If it can be done in anticipation of the passage of this Bill at the
next Session of Congress," I would suggest the expediency of making
immediate contracts for continuing the “King's Road” without delay
from “Six mile creek” to Smyrna; or at least reopen and repair it as
far as St. Augustine or Tomoka. Colo: Gadsden's estimate for the
whole route from the St. Mary's River to new Smyrna is $.11000;
but his estimate was based upon the employment of the Troops, con-
sequently is not a correct standard for contracts. But still, I am quite
positive that I can get the contracts taken & the Road completed under
that estimate, now that a part of it is taken off by making the Road on
it to Wantons; even if each appropriation is made to bear its own share
of that contract.—
I enclose herewith a paragraph cut out of the East Florida Herald
of the 13* June last published in St. Augustine,” believing it possible
that it might meet your eye, & if unnoticed & uncontradicted by me
produce an unfavorable impression. The statement is utterly false
with the single exception that I did send the advertisements to the
Commanding officer of the Post—I believe six or seven in number.
The facts are these;—I received your order on the 25" May" &
immediately caused a sufficient number of hand bills to be printed;
which were distributed in ample numbers to every section of Florida,
and along the seaboard of Georgia, addressing them to the Postmasters
with a request that they should be posted up and distributed; besides,
availing myself of private conveyances to distribute them through the
Country; so that by the date when this paragraph appeared in the St.
Augustine paper there was scarcely a man in Florida, even in the
remote corners of the pine woods, who did not know of the advertise-
ment. Conscious that if your orders to have it opened this season
were to be fulfilled, no time should be lost, I appointed to meet the
persons wishing to propose, at a central point between the two sections,
in order that they might, when examing the routes preparatory to
offering, at once put in their proposals and know the result. If I had
appointed to receive the proposals at Tallahassee or Pensacola, three
months at least would have been lost in receiving & answering the
proposals, and in closing the contracts. I did not publish it in the
newspapers because I knew that neither the one printed at St. August-
ine or at Tallahassee had sufficient circulation in the country to render
it of any consequence that I should do so; and in all cases previous to
this last, as well as it also, I depended for the publication of the adver-

tisement much more upon the hand bills than upon the newspapers.
Notwithstanding the Editor states he could not get one of the adver-
tisements so as to publish it, yet it appears that that difficulty was
afterwards removed, for I have observed that he did publish it in a
subsequent paper. It is useless, nay it would be tiresome, to trouble
you with the detail of the causes why I am thus honored with the
notice of the Editor of this paper, but I may say that it is not to any
interest that either he or those who write for his paper really feel for
the improvement & prosperity of the Territory; scarcely one of them

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours 1"
Ult° * covering a Bill, providing for the survey of the private claims
in Florida, but which, for the want of time was laid over by the
Senate—
I should have been pleased to have seen that Bill, a law; with the
exception of the 8” Section in the original, which has no connection
with the general provisions of the Bill, and which will be opposed if
attempted to be passed at the next Congress—I beg leave therefore
to suggest to your mind the propriety of having that section stricken
from the Bill for the following reasons—When I was ordered to this
section of country in 1814 *—to open my Office and enter on my
official duties, I purchased from a Gentleman resident here his im-
provement in houses and open land (situated on the quarter section
which seems to be embraced by this section of the Original Bill,)
which enabled me to commence the immediate execution of my
duties, and I have at much expence added largely to said improve-
ments since the purchase—Some time after my occupancy, this
quarter was reserved among several others as I am told by the Acting
Governor of Florida—

On the passage of the Pre-emption law,” believing myself entitled
under its provisions to the purchase of said Quarter, I applied to the
Register & Receiver at Tallahassee for this purpose, and was refused
on the ground that the quarter was reserved, although the reservation
was made long subsequent to inhabitation and improvement; I
therefore prayed and obtained a Mandammus returnable to next
court requiring the Register & Receiver to shew cause: and I mean to
take the question to the Supreme Court of the United States if it becomes
necessary—As this subject is therefore before the Judiciary and in all
probability will not soon be acted on, and being determined to have
any disposition of said property by Congress opposed, until a final
decision is had it might throw difficulties in the way of the passage
of an Act otherwise very important-

10.000 which will complete the payment of the Surveys executed, all

weeks ago, * respecting the public road, lately opened between this
place and Tallahassee, induces me to address you on another subject
of a very alarming nature, and of the highest importance to the peace
and security of the inhabitants of this Territory. I allude to the
unsettled State of the Indians, and the outrages which they have
recently Committed in this district. I beg leave to refer you, for
the particulars of these depredations, to an article in the East Florida
Herald, printed in this place, a copy of which paper I have the honour
herein to enclose.”
The inhabitants of this City and of the neighbouring Country are
now greatly excited and justly alarmed. They consider their lives
and property in imminent danger.
We have only one small company (about 50 men) of United States
troops stationed in this place.
Major Gen" Scott came here, a few weeks ago, and withdrew an
entire Company from the Garrison here, and sent it to Savannah in
Georgia, notwithstanding the most urgent remonstrances, and a
petition from the inhabitants entreating that these troops, at this
* See ante, p. 542, n.
* Not present. This, or some other article in that newspaper, elicited from
the Pensacola Gazette & W. Fla. Advertiser, Sept. 22, 1826, the following editorial:
“The Militia.—We observe that our brethren of East Florida, are agitating in
the Herald the question, why is not the Militia of our Territory properly organized,
mustered and exercised? This question with equal propriety might be asked
here—but who shall ask it? The people will not, for mustering is almost always
done with reluctance. Are there not officers, who have sworn correctly to per-
form the duties of of their offices, whose duty it is to see into this matter? We
think there are; we have for these three years had a General, Colonels, Majors
and Captains of Militia but we have never seen or heard of the privates who
compose the Brigades, Divisions, Regiments and Companies of their commands.
If the Militia laws are salutary, it is time they were attended to—if they are not,
let them be repealed. It is worse than ridiculous to have laws in our statute
book, which are a dead letter and only serve to add to the importance of some
individuals, by giving them imposing titles. We have lately observed in the
South Carolina papers, the trial, condemnation & sentence of a Militia officer,
for neglect of duty; but in this Territory, were Justice in this respect attempted,
there would be none left unimpeached of whom to form a Court, nor even an
officer to order it to be held—from the Commander in chief down, not one, we
believe, has done his duty! We speak with regard to the Militia of this County—
further we are not informed.
“We copy into this paper, an account of the formation of a Volunteer Militia
Company in St. Augustine, under the name of the “Florida Rangers.”—We think
that Volunteer Companies excite a spirit of emulation productive of a handsome
appearance in the Militia and are therefore pleased that the plan has been adopted.”
The account of the Florida Rangers mentioned above appeared in the E. Fla.
Herald, Aug. 8, 1826; reprinted in the Fla. Hist. Quar., XXIV (Apr. 1946), 290–291.

time, might not be removed from this place.” We have no militia
to rely upon for protection, in case of danger or attack of any kind:
There has never been any organization of the Militia in this part of
the Territory, though we have an excellent system of militia laws,
and a numerous band of officers, appointed by the Governor. There
has never been any enrolment, muster, or exercise of the inhabitants
in militia Companies or regiments. The arms sent here by the
General Government several years ago, for the use of the Militia
have never been distributed. No steps whatever have been taken,
as far as I can learn, by the Governor, who is, by law, declared to be
the Commander in chief of the Militia, to carry the militia laws into
effect.***
Under these circumstances, it is natural that the inhabitants Should
appeal to the Government of the United States for protection.
It is probable that you have been induced to order the troops to
be withdrawn from this place, by the representations made to your
department by the Governor of this Territory. When the Governor's
letter mentioning that these troops were of no use here, appeared in
print, it excited the greatest astonishment in the minds of the
people of this district. At that time the Indians were wandering all
over the Country; were in a famihed state, and Continually commit-
ting depredations upon the property of the inhabitants, and threaten-
ing their lives.
Neither the Governor, nor the Secretary who acts for him, during
his absence, has been in this part of the Territory, since the Sümmer
Autumn of the year 1823; and it is presumable that they are both
entirely ignorant of the real State of affairs in this district. The
Governor himself was absent from the Territory for upwards of a
year in 1824. & 1825.
I have taken the liberty frankly and candidly to make this repre-
sentation to you, in the hope that you will see the propriety of either
ordering the Company, lately withdrawn from this place, to be sent
back, or a full company from Some other post to be sent hither,
with all possible despatch.
Until the Indians be all removed, and quietly established within
the boundaries allotted to them by the late treaty, there can be no
peace or security for the inhabitants of this Territory.

GENTLEMEN, Your letter of the 15" of June " addressed to this

on the provisions of the 1st Section of the Act of 1813," those of the
Act of the 24" April 1820," making further provision for the sale of
the public Lands, and the uniform practice since the passage of the
Act of 1820.
The late Act refers to the Act of the 5* February 1813, as to the
manner in which the right of preemption is to be established, and that

Act declares, that “in every case where it shall appear to the satis-
faction of the Register & Receiver, that any person, who has delivered
his notice of claim is entitled according to the provisions of this Act
to a preference &c" under this provision the Register and Receiver
become the sole judges of the right, of the party claiming to a pre-
emption—and they will of course take such measures, and prescribe
such forms of evidence, as will satisfy their judgement as to the pro-
priety of granting a certificate. The evidence, I should think, ought
to be written, in the form of an affidavit or interrogatories, and sworn
to and duly certified by an acting Justice of the Peace, and if the
witnesses are not personally known to the Register & Receiver, their
credibility ought to be established by the evidence of persons of known
character & standing. It will be necessary to guard against fraud
by every possible precaution on the part of the Officers.
The land granted as a preemption must consist of an entire legal
quarter section, or fractional quarter Section, and not of two eight
parts of different quarters. The provisions of the 3" Section will not
vary this rule, it affects the apportionment of the quantities, to each
individual. Great precaution will be necessary to guard against
imposition on the government from applications under the provisions
of the 3" Section. Where Settlers have sons, over 21 years of age,
or overseers, attempts will be made to obtain more than one pre-
emption, and where there are two or more separate, distinct and inde-
pendent families settled on one quarter Section (which are cases
intended to be provided for) they will attempt to enter distant &
more valuable Land; they should be confined to the immediate
neighborhood as far as practicable, and to the particular sections into
which any of their improvements may extend.
The term “legal representative” in its strict import, is a repre-
sentative in law, and not by assignment. By adhering to this con-
struction of the term, and by granting your certificates to the original
claimants you will be releived from much embarrassment—if the
parties wish to assign their claims after confirmation, it can be done
in the usual manner and patents will issue to the assignee
It is necessary to forward a list of preemptions granted specifying
the tract, quantity and name of the person to whom granted It will
be unnecessary to forward the evidence, which will be carefully
preserved in your Office"

I have received yours of the 27" Ult.” The past winter an almost
succession of weekly complaints was made about the Mail to and
from St Augustine and Georgia—it was either delayed, wet, or neg-
lected and exposed—the complaints may have been groundless—yet
they appear to have a foundation—and it evidently shewed that there
was a want of confidence in the line or the conductors of it—added
to this, was the fact, that Mr Dagget a Post Master was virtually a
Contractor under you, and when Specially prohibited by Law from
so acting—under these circumstances it appeared to me to be proper
to make provision to employ a Successor to you under the hope of
restoring that confidence in the Mail route, which was lost through
your Agents, but the Authority given to your Post Master was not
absolute—he was directed to ascertain the most favorable terms for
which the Mail could be carried—he was then to forward the terms to
me for my decision—and I have decided not to close with the terms
submitted to me through his agency, provided the Mail continues to
be carried faithfully by you or your agents—The Mail must be

SIR, Your letter of the 9th of June " has been referred by the
Secretary of the Treasury to this Office. On reference to the Act
passed the 2nd day of March 1819,” to enable the people of Alabama
to form a Constitution you will perceive that the original provisions
of the original Act relative to the selection of lands for the use of a
Seminary of Learning in Alabama were changed, and the discretionary
powers of the Secretary of the Treasury enlarged. In all cases where
portions less than entire Township have been selected by the Secretary
of the Treasury for the use of the Seminary of Learning in any State or
Territory, it has been done under an Act granting authority to the
Secretary of the Treasury to select in specific quantities of less than
one entire township, and I have no doubt that on application from the
Governor & Council of Florida, Congress would grant to the Territory
of Florida that privilege as to the selection which has been specifically
granted to several of the States.”

STAUGUSTINE July 18, 1826
SIR I take the liberty of addressing you in relation to the occupa-
tion of certain rooms in Fort Marion as a county jail It will be seen
by, the copies enclosed that the Marshall of the District has been
directed to permit the Sheriff to occupy in common with him some part
of the Fort as a jail.” This he has refused except upon conditions
which cannot be compiled with by the Sheriff as I am informed by him.
As there never has been a prisoner committed in this County for any
crime against the United States and it is probable there may never be
it appears to have been the object of Gov" to grant this jail for county
purposes. Two things will probably be recollected: formerly the
Marshall had charge of the prisoners who are now in charge of the
Sheriff and as a law passed by the Legislative Council of the Territory
and approved by Congress prohibits the levying any tax for the pur-
pose of erecting county jails in the counties of St Johns and Escambia
it is presumable that it was intended the public buildings should be
used in those Counties. The Sheriff has heretofore kept his prisoners
in his own house as the house he then ocupied answered the purpose
The one he at present ocupies does not and he has been lately com-
pelled to refuse to recive prisoners delivered to him in consequence
of having no safe place of keeping. These reasons induce me to
request of you that directions may be given to enable the Sheriff to
occupy some part of the Fort as a jail."

DELEGATE WHITE TO GEORGE GRAHAM
[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.:ALS]
HARRODSBURG KY. July 19th 1826 *
SIR, The Agent of the Deaf & Dumb Assylum, of Ky,” called on
me yesterday to solicit my assent, to the location of the land in
Florida, as represented in the plat forwarded from your office, &
to the location of such parts as should be covered by the claims of
settlers on other contiguous public lands—Against both of which as
the Representative of the Territory, I feel it my duty to protest—& I
am gratified to perceive that there is such a coincidence in our opinions
on this subject. I do not think the Act of Congress * confers any
such power on the Secretary, & in giving instructions to locate it in
bodies of four sections each he has given the most liberal construction
that the law will warrant, & one which if not sanctioned by the prec-
edent in the donation to Connecticut, I should say was not warranted
by the letter or spirit of the law. The idea that they could hold over
the settlers was so preposterous as to require not even a passing
remark. The Act granting preemptions confers a title to the
spot on which the settlement was made.” The other gives a title
to be located in one of the Territories, the location to be approved by
the Secretary before any title to any specific land vested, & as the
preemption law passed before the location & approval there was a
vested right in the setlers, & I beg in their behalf most respectfully
* A letter by White of the same date on this subject was published in the
Pensacola Gazette & W. Fla. Advertiser, Aug. 25, 1826, and another of Sept. 26
was published in the issue of Sept. 29, 1826.
* Rev. Samuel K. Nelson was authorized by the Secretary of the Treas., May 4,
1826 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd., Sec. Treas., printed, A. S. P., Pub. Lands, v,
479), to locate a township for the Ky. Asylum in “not less than four entire &
contiguous sections.” Nelson wrote to the Secretary, June 20, 1826 (NA, HF,
Orig. Repts., TD, 20 Cong., 1 sess.), listing the lands he had selected in forty-two
sections of five townships to which a reply was made by George Graham, June
26, 1826 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 17, printed, A. S. P., op. cit., p. 483),
to the effect that the selection had not been made according to instructions.
Nelson expressed his disappointment to the Secretary, Aug. 18, 1826 (NA, HF,
loc. cit., printed, A. S. P., op. cit., p. 479–480), to which the latter replied, Sept.
5, 1826 (NA, HF, loc. cit., printed, A. S. P., op. cit., p. 481), that he would sanction
some of the selections made. This information was relayed to the Reg. and Rec.

and Some alarming outrages and depredations, which they have
recently committed in this district, have excited very Serious appre-
hensions, among the inhabitants, for the Safety of their lives and
property; and these apprehensions are greatly increased, in conse-
quence of the absence of the Indian Agent from this Territory.
Your petitioners beg leave further to State, that from the Scattered
population of the Yeomanry of this Territory, the ordinary Militia
movements are impracticable, and no reliance can be placed on this
Source for Such prompt defence, as may be necessary against the
ravages of the famished tribes of Indians Still remaining amongst
us; and the present feeble force of the United States troops, in this
quarter, is totally inadequate to prevent the incursions and violence
of the Savages, and afford the necessary protection to the inhabitants.
Your petitioners therefore pray that the Company of United States
troops, lately withdrawn from this place, may Speedily be returned,
or that Some other Company may be Sent hither, without delay; and
that for the future, at least two full companies may be kept here,
until perfect tranquility and security be restored, and all the Indians
be removed within the boundaries assigned to them by the late
Treaty.”
And your petitioners will ever pray &c.

TALLAHASSEE, July 20* 1826.
GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of a com-
munication to Capt. Clark respecting that part of the road from
Coleraine to Wanton's allotted to him to open, & of the documents
therein referred to. Although I know that the ground over which

the route to Branning's ferry would pass is the highest & best; and
the easiest for constructing a Road, avoiding altogether the St: Fé,
a difficult Stream to Bridge permanently, & bad to pass any how
when full; yet as the Route to Hagan's is so much desired by the
people I have recommended it to Capt. Clark in preference to the
other. The change in the route thus proposed will be but a slight
deviation from that recommended to your notice, on which the last
order was founded, & consists only in going to the upper ferry on
Black Creek, by keeping the Road on the west side instead of the
East side of the “South Prong” of Black Creek."—

(Copy.) TALLAHASSEE, July 20* 1826.
SIR, I enclose herewith certain papers from Sundry Citizens of
Florida numbered from 1 to 4 * respecting the Route for the Road
from Wanton's to Black Creek. There are two routes which will
come under your notice to choose between; the first to cross at
Branning's & the other at Hagan's ferry; for either of which I have
provided as you will see by the enclosed advertisement.” These
ferries are two & a half miles apart, “Branning's" being to the East, &
“Hagan's” to the west of where the “South prong” empties into
Black Creek. The first route, (Wiz: to Branning's,) is, leading from
Wanton's about eight miles up the “St. Mary's Road”, where there
is a trail turns off to the right & intersects the Road opened from
Pensacola to St. Augustine about nine miles eastwardly from where
the said St. Mary's road crosses the said Pensacola & St. Augustine
road; thence it continues on said Pensacola & St. Augustine road for
a distance of about twelve miles, passing by the Scrub Hammock
at the Internice ponds & Town about two miles, opposite to a large,

approval of the change of route. See Burch to Clark, July 21, 1826, NA (WD,

Fla. Hist. Quart., XIV, 175—176, enclosing copies of road contracts, including that
of Dec. 21, 1824 (ante, p. 128), for his use in connection with the opening of the
road in question. See post, p. 642.

open, clear-water, pond where there is a trail turning up to the left
hand, (north,) leading directly to Branning's Ferry, distant twenty
miles, & crossing two of the branches of the “South Prong” which will
require to be bridged. The Major part of this route is over high sand
hills. The second route is that recommended by the citizens, Viz:—
leading from Wanton's along the “St. Mary's road” to “Kingsley's
pond”, where it turns off to the right for Hagan's ferry, distant
therefrom eighteen miles. This route is through flat, wet, pine
woods to Kingsley's pond; from thence it is high sand ridges. The
chief obstruction in this route is bridging the St: Fé River. Both
routes will be about the same in point of distance, (say a little up-
wards of fifty miles,) but will, I believe, be as to shortness a little in
favor of going by Kingsley's pond. Both the places named for ferries
possess about equal advantages, there being no swamp or marsh on
either bank at either place. The Country nearest to the intended
road susceptible of much improvement or settlement lies to the west
of said St. Mary's Road; & in it are the Settled parts of Alachua,
commencing at the St. Fé natural Bridge & extending to the Alachua
Savannah, these Settlers carry their trade & purchase their supplies
either at Black Creek or at St. Mary's hence the road is all-important
to them, for if opened by Kingsley's pond, it will open to them a good
Road to Black Creek; thence to Jacksonville on the St. John’s; &
thence to St. Marys; in lieu of the difficult & precarious route they
now pursue along the “St. Mary's road” over an entire wilderness &
crossing the overflowing creeks forming the head branches of St.
Mary's River. The inhabitants at and below Sanfalaski fall into the
“St. Mary's Road” by cart paths, south of where it crosses the St.
Fé; & those of Dills' Settlement to the northward of the same, by a
cart path which crosses the St. Fé at a fording place lower down. No
Survey of these routes is at all necessary, as the Route from Wanton's
by the way of Kingsley's Pond to Hagan's ferry is a broad cart road.
And the route from Wanton's in like manner is fully designated by
the nature of the Country & by the routes already open therein, as
mentioned above. Flanking parties detached from the working
party to select & lay off the road, on whichever route may be chosen
keeping that as the general guide, will be sufficient to ensure the best
selection of ground for the Road to pass over. The intermediate
Country between these two Routes is altogether impracticable, being
occupied by the large marshes & ponds forming the head of the St:
Fé River; by other large ponds & Marshes including the extensive
ones of the Internice; & by the head branches & waters of the
“South Prong” of Black Creek which takes it rise here & has its

course running northwardly between the two routes, into Black
Creek. The first named route is most assuredly the best ground for
a Road & is that over which I had it always in contemplation to open
it if the route by Black Creek was approved, but it will be removed
to such a distance from the present population as to be out of their
reach, & it will pass over a Country in which there are no Settlers &
from its nature will never possess any of consequence. Whereas the
second named route, although much of it will be through a flat country
& more difficult of making a Road; yet as it will accommodate so well
the entire population of that part of the country & is so much desired
by them, I should not hesitate, if my opinion can be of any weight in
determining your choice, to adopt it for the route of the Road. I
should have answered your letter of the 28* May asking for informa-
tion respecting that part of the road allotted to your Superintendence,
at an earlier date, but I had understood that the people of that section
of Country would make some representations respecting it either to
you or myself, & I was awaiting a knowledge of that, in order then, to
to give you the fullest information in my power. I request that when
you have determined at which ferry you will bring the road, Hagan's
or Branning's, you will notify M. F. J. Ross, Contractor for that
Section of the Road at as early a date as possible, that he may be
governed accordingly in opening the Road:—his address is at Jackson-
ville, Duval County, Florida.—I have enclosed to Gen' Jesup copies
of this communication & of the papers therein mentioned. A copy of
my letter to him is enclosed herewith.—

I hesitate not to say, that some decisive step must be taken early,

between their own Situation And that of the Creeks—they have, and
do presume, that so far from meeting the punishment, they merit
for their Conduct, that the Government will protect them in their
COurSe.
Provisions have long since been transported to Tampa Bay for
the Indians—the want of Subsistence Can no longer be used as a
pretext for their conduct. The fact is, the best hunting ground is
within their own limits, yet they will not hunt, but in our settlements,
where they supply themselves with the Cattle and provisions of the
Settlers
I have had my house crouded with Indians for Six months, many
of them when sick come to me to be taken Care of—Common humanity
will not permit me to drive these people away when disease is preying
upon them—My private expence is not a little increased in this way.
In fact Sir, I must say that the interest of the people is suffering
so much, and my trouble and responsibility so greatly increased, that
it has become necessary for me to Apply again to the Department of

SIR, In obeidence to instructions of the 9" of June " I have
examined the road from the Ocholochony River to this place, I find
the road generally constructed according to the contracts, as ex-
plained to me by Cap" Burch, the instructions given by him to M.”
Bellamy &c.; I have pointed out to M* Bellamy some defects, prin-
cipally in the cause ways between this and the high grounds in Alachua,
he immediately set his hands to work, on the west side of the St
Johns River, and accompanied me to this place for hands and has
returned with them to complete the work required between this place
and the St Johns, so that in very few days the road will be completed,
M. Bellamy evinces a disposition to perform everything required of

him by the Contract, The nearest practicable route has been selected
for the road—but it is to be regretted it passes over a very low country,
which during the rainy season is covered with water in many plaeces
for ten miles in extent, the water however is never so deep but
that Teams can pass over it, the foundation being a firm hard sand.
in order to have a dry road at all seasons it would require sixty miles
of turnpike, this does not appear to have been contemplated by the
Contract in as much as it is neither miry, boggy, nor swampy;—
through this low section of Country I have been very particular in the
examination, and the very heavy rains that is constantly falling at
this season, enables me to judge of it correctly, and I am satisfied
that no miry ground has been left, without a causeway, The Country
bordering upon this section of the road is not susceptible of cultiva-
tion, consequently there is no settlements, between this and the
Alachua, a distance of ninety miles, travellers for the sake of accom-
modation leave this road at Alachua pass by Wantons to Palatki
Ferry on the St Johns even the mail travels that route at present.
The consequence is the Ferry at Picolati is not worth the attention of
any responsible person, and those who do travel this route are sub-
ject to disappointment in crossing the River. how this evil is to be
remedied I cannot say.—
So soon as M* Bellamy has completed the work I have directed, I
shall furnish him with the requisite certificates and return to Tampa
Bay.”
I have the honor to be Sir with great respect Your O” Ser*

SIR, A communication has been received from a citizen of Florida 10
inclosing the accompanying Newspaper essay which he asserts is a
true representation of the condition of your militia—at this time the

I have felt it my duty to submit it to your particular consideration
with a view to ascertain its correctness—and if true to suggest the
necessity of adopting immediate steps on your part to place your
militia on the most respectable footing—and furthermore how far
there is actual danger to the repose of the Territory to be apprehended,
and to what extent from the Indians—and what aid, is required from
the United States."

It would have contributed largely to the restoration of tranquility in

effects—The depredations complained of are committed by a small
party of wandering Refugees who can only be restrained by force;
and the better part of the nation would wish to See it exercised—They

Interpreter (whom I had despatched to Collect the Indians near the

this duty) have returned to this place. M. Doyle reports that the
Indians had moved off to Tampa Bay, and he Could not find one
remaining—The Supplies have no doubt drawn them to their own
Country
If it is possible for you to order a Block house to be established at
the Mouth of the Suwannee river and direct that one Company or
even 25 men Should occupy it, I believe it would at once induce the
Indians to remain within their limits. The Mouth of the Suwannee
is their Crossing place when they Come into the Settlements West
of that River—the Continuance of the force at that point will not
be required longer than 18 months after their establishment, for I am
Convinced the population of this part of Florida will be so numerous
as to controul the Indians who may wander West of that river, after
that period-

The expence of this Station will not be greater than at any other

If it is possible for you to let me have sixty five rifles and Accoutre-

This Country, from its extensive frontier is greatly exposed, And

S*AUGUSTINE 14 August 1826
SIR Having signed the memorial addressed to you by the Inhabit-
ants of this place," on the subject of the Florida Canal, I feel desirous
of explaining my views in relation to the route recommended; in order
that I may not be supposed to have united in the representation alluded
to, without that due consideration & Knowledge of the circumstances
of the country, which as an old resident of the territory might be prop-
erly expected from me. I beg leave first to observe, that I am fully
aware, that no entrance or port suitable for the reception of ships,
has been supposed to exist on any part of the coast west of Tampa Bay;
but as the greater portion of our western sea board, has never been
surveyed, I think it highly desireable that the route above referred to,
should be examined, as in the event of its being found unsuitable for
a Ship channel, it is, in my estimation, likely to prove the most
eligible direction in which to open a canal for boat or Steam navigation.
A canal in this direction, would pass through the richest part of
Florida, and would also place an inexhaustable Store of valuable
naval materials, at the command of the Gov". As a ship channel
however, is, I understand, the object of the Government, I take
the liberty of observing, that should the rout recommended in the
memorial be found unadapted to this purpose, that a canal upon the

the text of the letter nor the map has been found; it was answered by Macomb
on Sept. 4, 1826 (NA, WD, CE Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 3), stating that the letter
and map would be presented to the Board of Internal improvement. This action
was acknowledged by Bernard, Sept. 17, 1826 (loc. cit., Lets. Recd., B 166).

scale desired, may, I am persuaded, beat once opened from Tampa Bay
into the deepest waters of the river S. Johns, in which direction,
there would be but few obstecles to encounter, and comparatively
Speaking, but a short distance to be Cut. I feel convinced that even
from S* Marys, no other than a boat channel can be formed, from
the want of a proper harbour in the opposite direction on the Gulf of
Mexico. Tampa Bay is the deepest point on the western Sea board
of this penensula (as far as our present Knowledge extends) and may
as I have before said be easily connected with the navigable waters of
the St Johns. Wishing to be brief, and to intrude as little as possible

SIR, In your advertisement for opening the road from Coleraine to
Black Creek, we observe that you have designated either of the ferries
at Black Creek to cross at. It is of importance to us as inhabitants
of the Country that this road should leave Wantons and continue
the route along the present road from Alachua to St: Marys, crossing
the Santafee at the ford, thence to Kingsleys Pond and leaving it on
the left hand, cross Black Creek at the upper or Hagens ferry. This
route will open a Communication for the people residing in the lower
part of Alachua County to the tide water on St. Johns both at Black
Creek, and to Jacksonville, by a road to be opened from Gravelly
Hill, to the latter place, a distance of Six miles; moreover, such route
will accomodate the inhabitants of this Section of Country generally,
more than any other, in their Communications with each other;
we therefore hope that our request may prevail.

SIR I had the honor to receive your letter of the 6" instant *
with the paper printed at S*Augustine. There have been but two
regimental Musters in the Territory and these have been in Jackson
and Gadsden Counties, Company Musters have been common
throughout the Settlements in Florida with the exception of the
Counties of Escambia & St Johns. That the Militia is not properly
organized is readily admitted, and I believe this is the fact in most
of the States. It is admitted that the Officers are not equipped and
it would be difficult in many parts of this Country to procure the
articles required for this Object. Had a rigerous observance of the
Militia law been exacted (except the Brigadier Generals who are

appointed by the President with the advice of the Senate) Not an
Officer but would have resigned.
The Citizens of Florida are enterprising bold men and like the
mass of our best Citzens who have emigrated to new lands and
Countries do not bring, but come to acquire fortune, Not one in
five hundred has yet had the opportunity to purchase the cabin he
has built or the land he has opened in the forest to protect and sup-
port his family.—Nor is it probable that they would be inclined to
devote their slender savings for this anxious object, to uniform them-
selves—Many of our citizens now go twenty and thirty Miles to
Company Musters, that are unable in a large district thinly settled
to attend the muster of the Regiment. Gen.' Hernandez had fifty
Stand of Public arms from me he has made no report of their dis-
posal. Gen' Call who also received the remaining fifty has divided
them between two fine Companies of Volunteers which together with
private arms have placed them in a Situation for service.
I have been actively engaged during the Spring and summer in
trying to excite our Citizens to form themselves into Corps, There
are at this time four Companies of volunteers commanded by good
officers, If I had two hundred muskets, and one hundred rifles, to
place in the hands of such men as belong to this Territory, we would
want no aid or assistance from the United States to control the
Indians in Florida, if any danger is to be apprehended it is from about
two hundred lawless Indians Most of whom are the notorious Mico-
suka tribe, I had the honor last spring to give you this information
and to assure you that Nothing short of force would control this
banditti, They are the Outlaws of their own Nation and have Many
of them fled from Merited punishment which awaited them at home,
The great body of the Nation have long since quietly Settled on
their lands, and are friendly and attentive to the advice given to
them, The Nation have in Council Condemned the Indians who
have Constantly been depredating on our Settlers, but these fugi-
tives go wandring over the Territory, dealing destruction on the
Cattle and rifling the plantations, I apprehend more danger is likely
to arise from our own Citizens who are and have for some time
been ready to redress by force of arms the wrongs and injuries they
have sustained. It has required all my vigilance and influence to
restrain this hostile disposition, There is no danger of the Indians
resorting to arms except in self defence, they are entirely sensible
of their feeble situation and dependance on the Government—Some
Indians lately Murdered another on Major Woodruff's * plantation
on the S" John's River, for what cause is unknown The Indian that

was Murdered had resided some time with Maj Woodruff, I have
now his application sent to demand of the Chiefs that they surrender
the Murderers. And in case of Neglect or refusal it is hoped the
department will empower Me to send a force into the Nation to
arrest the Offenders
I would respectfully reccommend that a Block house be established
at or near the Mouth of the Suwannee River * which is the great
Crossing place of the Indians who travel west one Company if Sta-
tioned there for 18 Months will prevent in a great Measure the Indians
from depredating on the Citizens after that time the population will
be so much encreased in that quarter that the force May be withdrawn.
If previous to this however a detachment of regular troops could
be ordered from Pensacola or Tampa Bay to land at Fort St Marks
and scour all the Country between that place eastward thro' Alachua
County destroying all the Indian Settlements out of their limits, I
can assure you that No More Complaints will be Made of Indian
depredations, The moment they find the Government determined to
enforce the treaty they will at once submit. The disturbances in the
Creek Nation occasioned by the death of M*Intosh and other Causes
have mainly Contributed to Make a part of the Florida Indians
restless, turbulent and factious at home and insolent and daring
abroad 85

be a just subject of alarm—yet if circumstances exist to produce a
well grounded apprehension of such an event measures should be
adopted to prevent it. A dispersion of troops beyond necessity is
attended with inconvenience, and a detriment to discipline—with

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO ELIAS B. GOULD
[NA:PO, PMG Letter Book I]
POST OFFICE DEP' 31" Aug 1826.
Mr E. B. GoulD, St Augustine Florida,
I regret that any unpleasant differences have arisen out of the
investigation which was lately made at your instance—From the
facts which were developed by this enquiry; I have no doubt, that
the miscarriage of your papers, heretofore, may in a considerably
degree be attributed to the manner in which they were put up and
directed. I have taken great pains to ascertain the causes of the
failures of newspapers so frequently complained of, and I have ascer-
tained facts, that justify a belief, that five out of six failures may be
ascribed to this cause. The reports which have been made to me from
one distributing office, will sustain this statement.
It is remarkable, that Since I have been in the Dep', I have not
rec" a Single complaint, of the failure of “Niles Register,” and this
can only be accounted for, by the great care with which their paper is
prepared for the mail, where newspapers are folded when damp from
the press, and are only secured by a tender envelope & paste, it is
unreasonable to expect, that they will be safely conveyed to the places
of their destination. Strong wrapping paper and twine should be
used, and the direction should not be left to the least competent person
in the printing office, which is sometimes the case. If papers were
prepared for the mail in this manner, there would be little or no com-
plaint of failures. I do not wish to be understood as exculpating Post
Masters from neglect in the transmission of newspapers—No doubt
they are sometimes culpable and to correct this evil my duty &
inclination unite.
When P. Masters, who are sworn officers, & in many instances
highly responsible, men, are charged not only with carelessness, but
with the most culpable omissions of duty, which is sometimes done,
and even corrupt motives ascribed to them, it is to be expected that
they will become somewhat excited. Great allowance is made, and
should always be made, for the feelings of a printer, who is charged

more secure than those in any other part of the territory; that even depredating
Indians do not intend hostilities. See post, p. 642, n.

with neglect in not forwarding his papers to subscribers, when he
believes his duty, in this respect, has been strictly discharged—
I am sure your motive was laudable in your late complaints, and H
hope, that the investigation which has been had will produce some
good effect, and that so far, as the miscarriage of your papers have
arisen from the negligence of P. Masters, there will in future be no
ground for complaint. I shall ever be ready to enquire, on complaint
being made, and where negligence in any office continues, after
notice has been given to the P. Master, a more effectual step will be
taken—
So far from cherishing any hostility against any person who com-
plains of an evil, real or supposed, in this Dep', and asks for the remedy,
I feel under obligations to such person, for enabling me to correct an
irregularity, if it exist. It is a subject of regret, that this feeling does
not extend, at all times, to all who are officially connected with me—
It is expected that there will be delays in transmitting documents—
they sometimes amount to many Wagon Loads & can only be for-
warded when the size of the mail will admit— -
Some of the documents of last winter, are not yet printed—through
the summer, they have been forwarded in the mail, in almost every
direction *—. - -

GENERAL, My accounts entire for expenditures on the Road from
Pensacola to St. Augustine being now rendered and my duty in
respect to it ended I enclose herewith my own accounts for transpor-
tation of baggage incurred in part on that account; and also for a
per diem while necessarily employed on that duty agreeably to your

Delegate from Florida stating that it was agreed by yourself & by
M. Calhoun that I should receive the said sum of $.3 p" day for the
whole time I had been & should be thereafter employed on that
service. These Gentlemen had interested themselves in my favor
knowing the fatigue & exposure caused by performing the duty, &
the necessity of having some allowance to meet my increased expenses,
independent of giving me a just remuneration for individual labor
& services rendered not exactly in the line of my duty as Quarter
Master. The transportation account includes only such journies as
were made connected with the Road service separate and apart from
the daily travel performed while present with the troops & elsewhere,
which is altogether omitted, though very considerable if it had been
taken into the account. The Per diem account, although such was
the understanding at the time as stated, above, is not made for the
whole time I was superintending this work, but only such periods
during the time as I was actually engaged in the same. By an
examination of my accounts it will be seen that of the Appropriations
of $.28000 for this Road I have received from the Treasury $.27069,
of which there is an unexpended Balance of $.1501.08/100, which
added to the amount undrawn is $.2432.08/100. The accounts now
presented for your decision amount to $.1853.58/100 leaving still, if
admitted an unexpended Balance of $.578.50/100. In addition to
this balance there was a considerable quantity of property trans-
ferred to the service of the Q Mrs: Dept. in closing my accounts
for the 2" Q of 1826, of which no valuation has yet been made nor
credit given therefor to the Road account. The account for trans-
portation of baggage however properly belongs to the Q Mrs: Dept.
to pay, because it was chiefly occasioned by my duties as Quarter
Master at Pensacola & therefore should not be charged to the Road
account.—
I also enclose for your decision my accounts for services performed
in relation to the Road from Coleraine to Wanton’s, lettered A. B.
& C.”—The first lettered A. is for the examination & survey of the
Route for the Road previous to issuing the proposals for contracts
for opening it. In this service I consulted the strictest economy.
By reference to my Returns of property on hand at the time in the
Qr. Mrs: Dept. as well as the Road account it will be seen that I
had not a single disposable pack-horse or mule. The purchase of
four mules alone would have been $600, and I could not have marched
a detachment with less than twelve mules. The expenses of forag-
ing &c. for these and of the Detachment marching to Wanton's
would have exceeded the amount of the account presented for your
* Not present.

consideration, to say nothing of the purchase of the mules; and so
soon as I should have returned to Pensacola the mules would have
been no longer wanting for public service, the proof of which is the
fact that I have not had to purchase either a mule or Horse since,
but have had extra ones both for issue & sale. And in any event
if I had gone to the expense of fitting out & marching a detachment
thither I should still have required the services of some intelligent
person acquainted with the country as a guide. Whereas the whole
expense, in lieu of having a detachment & public means of trans-
portation, is the charge for my private transportation of baggage;
and the charge for a per diem as was allowed to me in the former
survey of a Road. The second account, lettered B., is charged for
transportation of baggage while on a journey from Tallahassee to
Jacksonville; & the third, lettered C., is for the per diem of $.3, while
engaged on that service in the same manner as is charged for serv-
ices on the Pensacola & St. Augustine Road, the interval thus
employed being left out in that account. These two sums amount-
ing to $.143.72/100 comprise the whole charge for a journey & serv-
ice that merely being paid for, not $500 would have been the least
inducement to me to have performed; nor could hardly any respect-
able man in the Country been found who would have incurred the
risk of such a journey at that season of the year on any account
whatever; but my orders were imperative & I was aware that
obedience was my province.—
Respecting the transportation accounts I do not suppose there can
be any difficulty; but in the case of the per diem in the accounts I
respectfully solicit your interest in favor of having them allowed.
And if they are allowed I am myself conscious that it will be money
dearly earnt. But if my Allowances are limited to the transportation
of baggage alone it will not cover my actual expenses. For the last
three years I have been a Slave to these duties, connected with my
regular duty as Q Master at Pensacola; & have not allowed myself
scarcely a day of recreation or for the enjoyment of society.—And in
addition to my services in regard to these roads, I believe my reports
& accounts in your Office will shew that my regular duties alone as
Quarter Master at Pensacola during the whole time I have been on
this station have been as active & more exposing, & the disbursements
as great, as those of any other officer of the Department. Such
continued exposure to the wet & rain of the Winter, & the heat of the
Summer sun in travelling have at length seriously impaired my health,
& I now find that rest & care are absolutely necessary for its restora-
tion. I would not again make the three several journeys across the
Peninsula of Florida & afterwards returning to this place (as per-
formed by me since May last,) incurring the same risk of fever by

exposure in an uncommonly hot Summer, for the whole amount of
these accounts, -transportation of baggage & per diem together.—
When the decision on these accounts is made I request that they
may be returned to me in order that my accounts for the Pensacola &
St. Augustine Road may then be finally settled & closed.—
From an examination of these accounts of mine together you will
perceive that I have made distinct & separate charges for the two
services to each; and not blending them together by charging either
a per diem or transportation for both at one & the same time, though
engaged in both services at the same time.—
I also enclose for your consideration an account for a per diem while
engaged in the Survey & opening the Road to Fort Mitchell." It
appears that it had an endorsement on the back of it made in your
Office, but afterwards erased, from which I infer that you, at least,
thought it equitable; and induces me to present it now a second time.
Indeed your letter of 29* November 1824 * authorizes me to charge
transportation in lieu thereof, which however I have not yet done as
I preferred again submitting the original account, & which but very
little exceeds the allowance of transportation if charged.”—

Gov" should be resurveyed at the public expense. You will much
oblige me, by furnishing an estimate of the expense which the public
would incur in making such resurveys in Florida, & what portion of
it would be required for the year 1827. This bill not having been
acted upon, your surveying for the winter of twenty seven will neces-
sarily be very much curtailed. You have already more Township
line surveyed than will be required, or which can be sectioned off
for two years. You will find much embarrassment arising from
surveying so many Township lines run previous to sectioning of them
off, particularly if the sectioning of them is delayed for any length of
time. My instructions to run off the township lines were given in
consequence of the peculiar situation and extent of the private claims,
and from a firm belief that an Act relative to the surveying the private
claims would have been passed at the last Session of Congress. That
Act having been deferred from the want of time to act upon it, it
becomes necessary and proper to curtail our surveying operations
until next fall, when I hope much may and will be done. The Lands,
which I think it now most desirable to have surveyed, are those lying
South of the St Johns River, and between that River and the Atlantic
as far South as Smyrna, and as this section of the Country is prin-
cipally covered by private claims, many of which have not yet been
confirmed, I should think it better to suspend the contracts until the
claims are finally acted upon, when the contracts can be made for
the complete surveying of the Townships. The only surveying there-
fore which I think you would be authorized to contract for, at present
for the year 1827. would be, for the sectioning of such Townships,
the lines of which had been run, which are of good quality, and which
were certainly known to contain no private claim, if there be any
of this description between the Suwannee & the Atlantic, they should
be surveyed this winter so as to bring them into market as soon as
possible. If an Act pass at the ensuing Session of Congress authoriz-
ing the survey of the private claims at the public expense, it will
embrace an appropriation for that purpose, and the surveying of the
private claims at the public expense may commence as soon as prac-
ticable next Autumn. It would not, however, be prudent to make
contracts in anticipation"

DUNCAN L. CLINCH TO THE ADJUTANT GENERAL
[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., C 224:LS]
Cantonment Clinch, FLORIDA 18* October, 1826
SIR, Having received information during the months of July &
August last, from persons of the highest respectability residing in the
interior of Florida, that parties of the Seminole Indians, were roaming
through the settlements alarming the inhabitants by threatening
their lives, and Committing the most lawless depredations on their
stock of Cattle and Hogs, and destroying their Cornfields, and that
unless protection was given, that many of them would be Compelled
to leave the Country—I Considered it my duty from instructions
heretofore received, to say to the Governor of Florida, in a letter dated
on the 4" of August,” that if he Considered the aid of the Military
necessary for the protection of the lives and property of the Citizens
of the interior of Florida, that I would promptly render him such aid
as was in my power, to effect this desirable object—In reply to this
letter Governor Duval, writes under date of the 19* September,”
which letter I received on Yesterday, and Confirming the reports
before alluded to, and requests the aid of Two Companies or such
number of the United States Troops, as I may from my knowledge of
the Indians and the situation of the Country, Consider necessary to
enable him to Compell those lawless Indians to return to their Na-
tion—But in as much as the alarm of the inhabitants have in some
Measure subsided, I have thought it most proper to inform the
General in Chief, of the Course I had proposed taking, to aid in the
protection of those settlements—and after submitting to him my
views as to the Course best Calculated to effect this desirable Object,
to await his Orders, before I proceed any farther in the business—
Such is the peculiar situation of the interior of Florida, owing to a
variety of Causes, that it will be some time before the settlements
will be sufficiently Strong, to protect themselves from the depreda-
tions of those wandering and lawless parties of Indians, unless they
are Compelled to remain within their own limits—To effect this
object, I would strongly but respectfully urge the necessity and
importance, of having one Company of Troops Ordered to Talla-
hassee, subject to the instruction of the Governor, there to be joined
by a Confidential Chief and twenty or thirty Active young Warriors,
selected from the Towns on the Appalachicola, to Scour the whole
Country, between Tallahassee and the Seminole Agency, Compelling
every Indian to return within their prescribed limits—after the per-
formance of which duty, to have the Company stationed at some

healthy Site, within a striking distance of the Agency for the Seminole
Indians—This would not only give Confidence to the present Settlers
and induce hundreds of others to Come into the Country—but would
enable the Agent to Controul and keep in Check the whole of the
nation,-As all experience goes to prove, that the appearance of a
Military force, has more influence on the minds of the Indians than
all the Talks that are held with, or the presents that are given to
them—The expence attending this movement would be small in
Comparison to the protection given, and the good that would result
from it to the Territory—The Troops could be landed at St Marks
at very little or no expence to the Government, and from thence,
there is an excellent road to the Agency—I am also induced to believe
that the expence of Supplying the Troops Stationed near the Agency
would not be any thing like as great, as has generally been imagined,
as the River Ocklawaha, runs within a short distance of the Agency,
and is said to be navigable for large boats or Schooners—Governor
Duval, informs me, that he has written to the Honorable Secretary
of war, on this subject," and as I know that he feels the deepest
interest in the prosperity of Florida, and that his information is much
more Correct and extensive than mine—I Consider any further re-
marks on my part, entirely unnecessary"—

honor to receive Orders N° 61, directing a Company of the 4* Infy.

lish a temporary military post, with the view to repress Indian incur-

will, of course, be complied with, without a moment's unnecessary
delay. But I, at the same time feel it my duty to state, that I am
fearful that the position selected for the military site, is too remote
from the main body of Indians to have the desired effect.—As it
must be at least one hundred miles from the Agency, and will still
leave all that section of Country lying between the Suwannee, S*
Mary's, and S. John's, exposed to their lawless depredations.—
The Settlements in the largest part of this section of Country,
are sparce, and the inhabitants less able than those of almost any
other part of Florida, to protect themselves, as many of them rely
entirely on their stock for the support of their families.
The establishment of a small military post near the Seminole
Agency, would not only give protection to this section of Country,
but it would also prevent the Indians from Crossing the S" John's
and harassing the settlements of some of the most respectable plant-
ers in Florida. It would also give equal protection to the settle-
ments west of the Suwannee river, as the Commanding Officer could
Co-operate with the Agent, with much greater effect, when near him,
than he could at a distance of one hundred miles "–
With consideration of high respect, I remain Your Mo. ob. S"

months after the work was finally accepted by Capt. Clark, when
public opinion may be supposed to have passed sentence on the
work & awarded either merit or blame to those concerned.—
Since my arrival here I have learned from Gov" Duval that an
order had issued for the establishment of a Military Post, consisting
of one Company, on the Suwannee River; and also that he had made
a previous Requisition on the Commanding Officer at Pensacola for
two Companies to repair to Tallahassee, scour the Country, & com-
pel the wandering Indians to leave the Settlements & go within
their boundaries. This last had been anticipated by Colonel Clinch
on account of the difficulties which had arisen from their constant
depredations; and I may now daily expect from him orders to pro-
vide the necessary transportation, after landing at St. Marks, for
them while marching through the Country; which, being on the Spot
where it will be required, I can effect with promptitude.
For this transportation, and the calls which will be made upon me
for materials & funds necessary in establishing the contemplated
Post, I shall require a remittance on that account of six thousand

of the 11* Sept'" written in my absence, are received. Your
bill for Eight hundred Dollars in favor of H. W. Braden, Esq. on
account of the survey of the Indian boundary has been paid.
Four thousand Dollars will be remitted to New Orleans and placed
to your credit in the Branch Bank there, as part of the provision made
by Congress for the supply of the wants of destitute Indians. I am
charged by the Secretary of War to call your special attention to this
provision; and to remark that it was made expressly to save the
Indians from suffering; and to relieve them, only, in their need.
Nothing is more certain, than that the very knowledge on the part
of the Indians that such a resource was provided would so act upon
their exertions to which necessity might prompt them as to relax
even these, and induce them to throw the entire burden of their
wants upon the Government; and when these twenty thousand
Dollars, should be expended, they would be not a whit better off,
than they were at the time the provision was made.

It is, therefore, made your special duty, so to apply those means,
as to obviate such a consequence. The Indians should be thrown
upon their own resources; and even permitted to feel that their own
labor was essential to their living—and then, and when this should
be found inadequate to supply their necessities, timely, and cautious
aid should be given them; but even then, in such manner as not to
lead them to expect its recurrence.
As those Indians have subsisted thus long without this aid, it is
hoped they have learned how to take care of themselves; and that,
but little, if any more of the appropriation will be required, except
on the failure of their crops, or some unlooked for emergency. The
balance of the provision made by a resort to the Contingency of the
Indian Department of the 2000, and 5000$, it is deemed not necessary,
for the present, further to touch, especially as the fund is so low, as,
to be scarcely able to bear the customary drafts upon it; and it is
hoped that no more may be needed from the appropriation made by
Congress. Of this however, you will be better able to judge, as the
condition of the Indians and their wants shall be from time to time,
make known to you. Whenever, therefore, it shall be necessary
to resort to the provision of the Government, it will afforded out of
that made by the Congress.
I need not tell you that Humanity to the Indians requires it of the
Government, no less to throw them upon their own resources, than
to feed them and keep them from starving when these shall prove
inadequate.
You will consider, therefore, the remaining Sixteen, (after deducting
therefrom the amount drawn for on account of the 2000, and 5000, $)
out of the Twenty thousand Dollars, provided by Congress,” to be
all that is now applicable to the supply of the wants of the Indians;
and this only in the way that has been stated.
To obviate the inconvenience of drawing, as you have stated them
to be so great, the Secretary directs me to inform you that he will
request it of the Treasury, in the future, to remit upon his requisitions.
You will therefore, in the future, give timely advice of the sum, or
sums, needed by you, stating the object, or objects for which they
may be required, when remittances, if in the power of the Treasury,
to make them, at the points where the funds may be required, will
be made.”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF THE
WESTERN JUDICIAL DISTRICT
[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[November 6, 1826]
To the Honourable Senate & House of Representatives in Congress
assembled.
The undersigned, inhabitants of the western judicial district of
Florida, most respectfully represent, that the nearest land office is at
Tallahassee, distant from most of us two hundred & thirty miles,
entirely removed from the ordinary business of the inhabitants of
this district, and separated from us by an uninhabited wilderness;
and hence it becomes onerous and oppressive for the people of this
District to make journies so long and difficult, for the purpose of
attending sales, entering lands, or securing pre-emption rights, which
the bounty of Congress has conferred on many of your petitioners.
That the construction, which the Register & Receiver at Tallahassee
have given to the act of Congress, granting pre-emption rights to the
citizens of this Territory; to wit; that all those, entitled to pre-emption
should enter & pay for their lands before the first day of January
next, however remote their claims may be situated from the lands
then offered for sale, we consider contrary to the spirit meaning of
the act, & as tantamount to a denial of the bounty intended by
congress. For many are unable yet to comply with the conditions,
and if all are called upon to pay for their pre-emptions at the same
period, the circulating medium of the Territory is insufficient to meet
the occasion, & the purchases, that the citizens will otherwise make.
Besides in the Western District the surveys are yet incomplite, & it
is impossible for all those entitled to pre-emption rights to designate
their claims in the manner contemplated by the act of congress. We
pray, that your Honourable bodies, would establish by law another
land office at Pensacola, which shall embrace the business arising in
the western judicial district. This point will better accommodate the
people of the district than any other, as they resort there for a market
for their produce, & for the purchase of their supplies.
Nor will another office be equal to the ratio established in other
places. In Alabama there are five land offices, while in Florida there
are but two, & yet the latter has more square miles of territory than
the former. It is, we concieve, essential to the rights of the citizens
of this district, that a land office be established at Pensacola, and,
that a time certain should be fixed for those entitled to pre-emption
to make entry & payment for their lands.” And will ever pray &c.

SIR A Company of the United States Infantry under the com-
mand of Capt F L Dade have gone on to the Suwannee to establish
a military Post." It will be some time before the Commanding
Officer will be able to Select a Cite for the Post and obtain the neces-
sary Supplies. Co." Clinch believes and has so informed the war
Department that the Post should be established near the Agency,
this was what I always desired and would have greatly prefered. If
the Secretary would be pleased to modify the Order So as to permit
Co'Clinch to Select the most eligible point for the Post that would
enable the Commanding Officer to Controul the lawless Indians it
seems to me much good would result from it—near the Agency water
transportation may be had to Supply the Post.
I directed Maj. Phagan last Summer to take up his residence in
the vecinity of the Apalachicola Indians,—this was necessary owing
to a sett of white men who reside near the Indians, whose lawless
conduct has hitherto annoyed and injured the Hadians them—the
Sub Agents presence was required to protect them and their prop-
erty from these men—no legal proof could be procured of their steal-
ing the horses cattle and hogs of the Indians but I had no doubt
of the fact.

Valuable lands belonging to Individuals.
My own Opinion is, as I formerly wrote you that an experimental
line should first be run to ascertain what good lands may be included
north of the Big Swamp, and then the true line Could be afterwards
run and marked so as to give to the Indians as much good land as
their numbers required "-

TALLAHASSEE 10" Nov 1826
SIR. The enclosed copies of Judicial decissions of the Superior
Court of this District," will inform you of Some of the difficulties
the Register and myself have encountered in carrying in to effect the
law granting pre-emptive rights in Florida."
The claim of Gov" Duval (which you will find among the decissions)
is for one of the quarter Sections reserved from Sale by the Register
and Receiver for the use of the Town of Tallahassee, under the au-
thority given them in your letter of March 1825.” The pre-emption
law only excludes from entry such land as had been previously re-
served from Sale by former Acts of Congress. But as this reservation
had been made by the department for the Special use and benefit
of Tallahassee, and as it was never intended for the use of any individ-
ual. The Register and receiver were unwilling to allow the entry.
This decission of the court you will percieve is against us, but we
have appealed from that decission; confident as we are that it was
never the intention of Congress to grant this land to any individual.”
In an other case you will discover that the Court has given a differ-
ent construction to the terms legal representative, than that intimated
in your instructions to the Register and Receiver. Under this decis-
sion we are now acting and with less embarrassment, than I at first
apprehended. The words “inhabited and cultivated” as expressed
in the law, have also been greatly enlarged in their Signification by
the decission of the Court. The Register and Receiver had construed
them to mean a fixed residence, and an actual tilling of the Soil,
Sowing reaping, &c. But the Court has been much more liberal,
and perhaps more correct. We have already had many cases of
mandamus, under this law and shall probably have many more before
its expiration We are extremely desireous of being informed how
far we shall be justifiable in pursuing the instructions of the depart-
ment in opposition to the decissions of the Court. At present we
have acquiessed in the decission, until further advices can be further
advised by the Department.”
Very Respectfully Your Ob*S*

To the House of Representatives of U States—
The undersigned a portion of the Inhabitants of East Florida, beg
leave to represent, that They are subjected to great inconveniences
by the present arrangement of the Mail, which can be easily remedied
without an increase of expence & the Mail transported by a safer
conveyance & more expeditiously than at present. The Mail from
S’ Marys to Saint Augustin is now conveyed on horseback over a
road almost impassible & at the hazard in high water of a total loss
of the Mail, through a Pine Desert where there are not now & never
will be Inhabitants—
The Settlements are near the Coast and towards the mouth of the
River S" John & they take leave to say that if the Route was altered
so far as to allow the transportation by water through an inland
Navigation from S' Marys to Jacksonville and direct a Post-Office at
the mouth of St John called the town of S" John or the Bluff where
there is now a Port of Delivery & an increasing Population—It would
accomodate all the Inhabitants of Amelia Island and on the Coast
and on each side of the River S" John which constitute the principal
settlements of Three Counties—
The undersigned are of opinion that the Contractor would transport
the Mail in this way for a smaller sum and at the same or a less time
which is submitted for your consideration with other details which
will be given to you by our Deligate in Congress *
We are with high Considerations of Respect Y M* Obed" Serv"—

veyed under the Spanish Government; and what portion of it would
be required for the year 1827*—In answer, I have to remark; that
I have no data in my possession whatever, to found an estimate
upon—The suspension of the Surveys for the ensueing season I con-
sider a very prudent measure, and from the best information I can
obtain at present, I am decidedly of the opinion, that there is no land,
Townshiped, east of the Suwannee River, free from private claims;
that is of the character, which you have authorized the survey of; I
therefore shall decline making any contracts until an Appropriation
is made for laying down the private claims—I expected to have been
enabled to forward you the whole of the surveys which have been
executed; in all the present month, but owing to the confinement of
M” Butler, together with the loss of one of my sons, I have been
thrown back in my business. I shall however soon be enabled to
finish them, and shall forward them from time to time, as they may
be finally completed—I wish you to have the Bill for the Surveying
of the private claims in Florida, disencumbered from the Section
which authorized the Legislative Council to dispose of a part of the
Quarter Section on which I reside, as I have petitioned Congress for
permission to enter the same under the pre-emption Law; * it having

SIR I had the honor by the last mail to receive your letter of the
6" Inst: * The $2000 and the $5000 which you suppose is unexpended
except so far as the drafts have been paid was actually laid out, a
part in last February and the residue in May in the purchase of
provisions for the Indians and the same as you will see from the returns
of Oren Marsh the Sub Agent was long since issued to the Indians.
My letter of the 8" day of August 1826." to the Secretary of War
will Shew that I sent Maj Phagan with the drafts to New Orleans to
purchase provisions, and that he failed in getting them negociated.
You are requested to read the whole letter of which the enclosed is
an extract.
I had visited the Indians last winter and Spring at their Towns,
and immediately sent the Sub Agent on my return here to New
Orleans as Stated to procure provisions. The extreme wants of the
Indians required this should be done promptly, and at the time there
was no other fund at my disposal than the $2000 and $5000. I am
therefore personally responsible for the money thus expended and
have been injured by not receiving it in due time. -
The drouth last summer which destroyed the crops in North and
South Carolina and Georgia, entirely ruined the crops of Corn &
Potatoes from Alachua to Tampa Bay And although when I saw
them last Spring they were very promising, the Indians are more
destitute than ever. The white inhabitants must, with all their
care, and industry Suffer for provisions until their next Crop.

The letter of the Secretary dated 13" of July last "was immediately
acted upon. The Chiefs of the nations were assembled and distinctly
informed that no rations should issue to the Indians who did not
permanently reside within their boundary. Under the instructions
received, the Indians expect to receive Corn and Salt, and in fact
they cannot exist without it. They are now Apprised that after
the present sum of $20,000 is expended that they are not to receive
and must not expect another supply of provisions from the Govern-
ment
I have long entertained the opinion you have expressed that these
people should be thrown on their own resourses. And if their crops
had not wholely failed I should not have expended a dollar of the
$20,000 Appropriated until I had Orders to do so. Under all the
Circumstances I must advise that the whole amount be furnished
as early as possible to the Indians—the Corn will not reach Tampa
Bay until it is almost time to plant as I shall not order a further Supply
until I hear from you, although I am Confident the Indians will
suffer before that time. I have incurred much and heavy responsi-
bility in making purchases without funds in hand, and will in future
under no state of things ever place myself in a Similar Situation
My great anxiety to meet the views of the Department and to act
promptly has had the effect to involve me in trouble, it does seem to
me, that my efforts to serve my country, and their Consequent
responsibility, will ruin me, unless I am seconded promptly by your
Department
You have before this received the returns of the Sub Agent Mr
Marsh of the issues that have been made during the present year to
the Indians these issues are considerable and the only bill I have
drawn on the Department for the whole purchases, was the one in
favor of Mr Braden and lately of $6525 Doll" in favor of M Crupper *
for corn and Salt. long since delivered and issued to the Indians. If
I had not provided for the wants of the Indians at the time I did the
whole country would have been over run by them, for a starving
people cannot be controuled even by force.
I have acted throughout with a steady view to economy and the
interest of the country, and shall regret sincerely if the Secretary
should be dissatisfied.
I am anxious to surrender my Situation as Superintendant and
request you will solicit M Barbour to get a bill passed giving the
entire controul and management of the Indians to the Agent. My
duties as Governor are too much interfered with by the business of

A Motion for a Writ of Mandamus
[C] [October 14, 1826]
In the Matter of Robert Butler, on a Matter Writ of Mandamus.
This is a Motion for a Peremptory Mandamus; to be directed to
the Register and Receiver of the Land Office, Commanding them to
admit the entry of a Certain tract of land, described in the proceedings,
on an alledged prêemptive right.
By an Act of the Congress of the United States, the Executive of
Florida was authorised to Select three quarter Sections, adjacent to
that assigned for the Metropolis; of which a reservation was made.
In pursuance of this Act a reservation was duly made, Compre-
hending the land in question.
By the Act granting the préemptive rights of Florida; reference is
made to another Act, granting préemptive rights in another quarter.
According to my Construction of the two acts taken together, the
latter is to be Considered in the same light as if it had been re-enacted,
in the same words, in the former; with the necessary explanations
exceptions of geographical identificationtień and of time.
The latter expressly excludes public reservations from the right of
prêemption.
It is therefore, the Opinion and Judgement of the Court, that the
present applicant Cannot sustain a legitimate right of préemption to
the land in question, and that the motion for the Mandamus must,
Consequently be overruled.
The Meritoriousness of the Claim being equal to, if not transcending,
that of others, the peculiar hardship of the Case is perfectly obvious;
but a remedy can only be sought in a prompt resort to the legislative
power, whose liberality and Sense of intrinsic justice have held seldom
been appealed to in vain, and, among the enactments of which, prec-
edents, granting relief in similar Cases are to be found.

I rec" y” application to change the route between S. Augustine &
Tallahassee & to establish a P. O. at Pilitica,” sometime since, but I
have not been able to satisfy myself in regard to making the change
you propose. Our knowledge of Florida, is limited, & it is difficult

DELEGATE WHITE TO GEORGE GRAHAM
[LC:Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser, Jan. 5, 1827 *]
Washington, Dec. 5th, 1826.
SIR—I understand that the Register and Receiver of the Land
Office in the Western District of Florida, entertain an opinion that
no claim can be presented, under the act granting the right of pre-
emption to the purchase of lands, in that Territory, approved 22nd
of April 1826," after the first Monday in January next. This opinion
I learn, from a letter addressed to me by the Register, is founded on
a construction of that act, and the one passed for Illinois Territory,”
which has been made the basis of our law. The introduction of an
act, framed in reference to the local condition of another country,
upon the organization of land offices somewhat different, it was fore-
seen would produce some confusion, and might admit by its ambiguous
phraseology of a variety of interpretations, and I should have been
pleased to avoid any reference to that law; it was deemed proper by
some of the friends of the bill, however, to incorporate that law, with
a view of availing ourselves of the benefit, of the precedent established
by Congress for Illinois Territory. If therefore, there were contra-
dictory provisions, or the context should be considered doubtful,
a reference to the well settled rule of construction, the intention of
Congress, would reconcile these discrepancies. In my humble judg-
ment, however, the law does not, either from the context or the

intention of Congress, as it may be collected from the whole act,
warrant such a construction. The act for Illinois, requires that
claims shall be presented two weeks before the “commencement of
the public sales in the district wherein the land lies.” It is evident
that the “commencement” here spoken of, is of each public sale of
that portion proclaimed, and not of the first public sale in the District,
and if that was the law in Illinois, it is entirely inapplicable to Florida,
as the “public sales” in that District had commenced in May pre-
ceding the passage of the law; besides, in another part of the Illinois
act, it is required that the quarter section shall be designated in the
notice. It is impossible that this requisition could be complied with,
when the public lands were not surveyed, and it must be apparent
that such was not the intention of Congress, as that body had at the
same session appropriated $24000, for the continuation of the surveys
in Florida,” and any rule that would exclude those who could not
present their claims, from these considerations, would be repugnant
to the spirit of the law, and would render the intention of it, inopera-
tive, so far as it affects the interest of a large portion of the people
of that Territory.
Besides, in a subsequent section of the same act, the claimants in
Mississippi and Alabama, who had exhibited their proofs several
years before, and whose claims were reported upon by Commissioners,
are given two years to enter them. It could never have been intended,
that the people in Florida should designate sections and quarter
sections, where there had been no surveys—procure proof, and take
out their titles in the short space of a few months. The law can
only mean to require, according to this view of it, the claimants
within the District proclaimed for sale, to file their notices two weeks
before the commencement of that sale, and in this opinion I am
confirmed by the Committee who reported the bill. If you should
concur in this view of the subject, I have to request that instructions
may be issued to those officers accordingly, and if not, I must make
an application to Congress for an amendment of the law. I beg
leave to request as early an answer as may be convenient to you.
I am with great respect,
Your Obe’t. Servant.

Capt. Dade.” It may serve to attach them to us; whilst the service
may shew them the objects and purpose of the Government. I
accompany this also, with five Medals for the five Apalachicola Chiefs,
to be given to them in token of the friendship of their Great Father,
and accompanied by such remarks in reference to the obligation which
this mark of distinction confers upon them, to be firm in their friend-
ship and sober and upright in their conduct towards the Government
and Citizens of the United States.
The orders to Col° Clinch have been so modified in regard to the
location of a site as to authorize him to fix it in his discretion. The
Secretary approves the location of Maj. Phagan; the cost of building
his Cabin, (1403) will be allowed when it appears in your accounts.
In refering Major Coffee to you for the direction and termination
of the lines of the survey he was directed to make, the Department
was governed by your knowledge of the Country, and besides, it had
no instructions to give; You were informed of the object of the
executive which is to give the necessary extension of limits to the
Indians; and these, as you had been appointed to examine the Country,
it was reasonable to suppose you could best fix; and especially so as
to avoid coming in contact, as far as possible, with the settlements of
the Whites. One of your three letters before me of the 9* bears out
this inference—for you say, you understood when the Chiefs were
at Washington that a promise was made them that their line should
run to a place called Wetomkee, and then say, this is not necessary,
and besides, it will take in some valuable lands settled by Individuals.
Now this was precisely what the Department wished to avoid in re-
fering Major Coffee to you. It was not intended to give more lands
than should be necessary in this extension; nor, if that could be
avoided, to interfere with lands settled by Individuals. To whom
could the subject then be referr'd so well as to yourself? You will
therefore direct Maj Coffee upon such a basis—That is give the
Indians a sufficiency, and avoid as far as possible embracing the
lands settled by Individuals—You are referr'd to my letter of 22"
May last; * and which was as specific as it was possible to make it.
In regard to the promise made the Indians when here, that their
line should run to Wetomkee, I have to state that this, is believed
to be the first time I have heard that name in reference to this subject.”

had served under him. See also DuVal to the Secretary of War, Jan. 29, 1827

SIR. After the date of my letter & Communication of the 6"
Inst. Information was received from Gen' Call and Col° Gadsden
that on yesterday morning the Indians Committed a Murder of the
70 Answered post, p. 717. See DuVal to the Secretary of War, Dec. 14, 1826
(NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.), disclosing anew the Indian hostilities which had
aroused the country. He did not believe that the main body of the Seminole
nation was involved but just the Mickasuky tribe which could only be controlled
by force. See also John Bellamy (Bellame), writing from Leon City, to the
Secretary of War, Dec. 31, 1826 (loc. cit.), stating that the Indians had preyed
on his property for two years and that his inability to obtain redress for dam-
ages had resulted in an application to the War Department. Additional docu-
ments regarding the Bellamy claim are: McKenney to Bellamy, Feb. 8, 1827
(loc. cit., Lets. Sent, Bk. 3), with advice that the claim should be submitted to
the Governor or the Indian Agent; DuVal to the Secretary of War, Nov. 29,
1827 (loc. cit., Lets. Recd., Fla.), embodying a report on the matter; and McKen-
ney to DuVal, Dec. 19, 1827 (loc. cit., Lets. Sent, Bk. 4), advising that the Sec-
retary had allowed $1,642, to be diverted from the Indian annuities, to pay
the claim. -

most Shocking Character on the West Side of the Oscilla River.—One
white man four children & one Negro. were the victims and the
house burnt to ashes.
From Circumstances of recent origin an opinion exists that the
discontented Creek Indians together with the Indians formerly of
Mickasuky have lately been Communicating freely. and have threat-
ened to destroy our Citizens and lay waste the Country. This
Outrage is the forerunner of some Desperate Movement of these
restless beings of both Nations. I have given Orders for the im-
mediate assemblage of the force of Alachua and the adjoining Counties
for the protection of that Section bordering on the Indian reservation,
Capt. Dade has been instructed to fall back on the Oscilla; "And as
it is of the utmost importance that the North Section of Middle
Florida should be ocupied with a view of intercepting any force that
might from the Creek Nation attempt to form a junction with the
Seminoles,” I require that you sheuld detach at least three Companys
from your Command and that the same be despached to this point
with all possible expedition
In making this request on you Sir I have not perhaps such authority
from the general Government as you would Consider obligatory on
you. But as the Executive Officer of this Territory having the
Charge of the Welfare of its Citizens who belong to the great family
of the Nation, I make this appeal to you claiming all and every
responsibility arrising out of it.”

71 Cn Dec. 14, 1826, Duval informed the Secretary of War that he had counter-
manded the orders for this move as he was afraid such action might be con-
sidered by the Indians as a retreat (NA, WD, AGO Lets. Recd., D28, filed with
Dade to the Adjutant General, May 6, 1827).
* The letter to Brooke is almost identical with the above except at this point
appear the words: “And to effect this the more certainly their usual means of
water transportation from the Coast to the Oscilla should be seized with great
despatch.” Brooke informed the Adjutant General, Dec. 18, 1826 (NA, WD,
AGO Lets. Recd., B212), of the Indian hostility in E. Fla. and recommended the
establishment of a string of four blockhouses to control the area from the Suwannee
river to the St. John’s river. He enclosed letters from DuVal, Dec. 9, 1826, and
from Oren Marsh, Dec. 12, 1826, amplifying the dangers. See also Gaines to
the Commanding General, Jan. 1, 1827 (NA, WD, West. Dept., Lets. Sent,
Bk. 4), informing him of DuVal's requests for aid and that he was on his way to
Tallahassee to take personal charge of the matter if necessary.
* See Governor Troup, of Georgia, to the Secretary of War, Dec. 8, 1826
(NA,OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.), enclosing documents connected with Indian hostili-
ties near the Florida line which would require defensive measures, and stating
that officers were instructed to follow defensive tactics only and to disband
promptly.

as I understand, that the adjustment of your account has been delayed in conse-
quence of defalcations on his part materially involving the settlement with you,
I deem it a duty I owe to you and to him to state that, such is not the fact—and
for your satisfaction I herewith inclose you Copies of my letters to him under
date of the 14th June & 27th Sept" last past the balance standing against him on
the Books of this Office is, $4,860.53 to which he has an offset of $2,952.60 paid
by him to M. Crupper for provisions furnished, and suspended in the Settlement
of his account in consequence of his not having filed the Contract under which
the provisions were furnished—he will now be credited with that Sum (the Con-
tract having this day been filed in my Office) which will reduce the balance
against him to $1,907.93 exclusive of his Claim for Salary, and a small amount
of suspended vouchers as acting Governor, which he stated when last here, he

MEMORIAL TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.:DS]
[December 14, 1826]
To John Quincy Adams, President of the United States.
The memorial of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida
respectfully sheweth, That your Memorialists are fully persuaded
that it is the intention of the general Government, to afford every
possible means within its control, to protect and secure the rights
of the citizens, when compatible with national justice.
That Congress at its last session with great liberality, and a just re-
gard for the interest of our Territory, extended and granted a right
of preemption to the early settlers of the Territory,” with provisions
however that the same be complied with, and perfected at the Land
Office, two weeks previous to the land sales, which take place on the
third Monday in January next, at Tallahassee.
Of these inestimable previleges, thus granted by the generosity of
Congress, the citizens of this Territory are about to be deprived.
The present Indian hostilities having called them from their homes,
and compelled them to take up arms in the defence of their country.
The receiver of public monies, whose duty it is to receive and grant
those preemption claims, is now at their head aiding in suppressing
the incursions of the savage foe, and endeavouring to afford protection
and safety to our frontier settlements.—From these facts the Presi-
dent will readily perceive that the citizens of Florida cannot avail
themselves of the privilege of pre-emption previous to the day ap-
pointed by his proclamation for the sale of lands in this District;
and that the same will be lost to them unless he will postpone the
land sales to some future period; Which your Memorialists in the
name of the people respectfully request may be done.
Your memorialists can state with certainty that not more than one
third of the pre-emption claims alluded to, have been adjudicated
upon, and the probablity is that the receiver of public monies, as
* Act approved Apr 22, 1826, 4 STAT. 154–155. See Call to Graham, Sept.
15, 1826 (NA, GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee), inquiring as to the method
of reporting preemption claims, whether monthly or when the whole is completed;
and Graham to Call, Oct. 9, 1826 (loc. cit., Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 18), advising
that reports on preemption claims should be transmitted monthly.

well as the pre-emption claimants will be employed in the protection
of the country during the whole time which is allowed by the procla-
mation for their adjudication and settlement.
Your memorialists would further represent, that in their opinion
under the present disturbed situation of the country, the land sales
would prove prejudicial to the interests of the general government,
as their can be no doubt but what purchasers would be prevented
from attending the sales in consequence of the present Indian dis-
turbances
That under any circumstances, your memorialists are of opinion
that a potponement of the Land sales at this time, would prove highly
beneficial to the interests of the Territory, as well as the general
government, as the lands in this Territory are daily increasing in value
Your memorialists earnestly hope and respectfully request, that
the attention of the President may be drawn to this subject immedi-
ately; as there is scarcely time for the information of the postponement
in the event of that favour being granted to us, to reach Tallahassee
previous to the day fixed on for the sale above mentioned
All of which is respectfully submitted
Resolved, That the above memorial be received, and that the
Governor of the Territory be authorised to employ some suitable
person to carry this memorial to the City of Washington; and deliver
the same to the Delegate in Congress; And if possible to bring with
him the determination of the President upon the subject of the memo-
rial; And that the expence of the same, be paid out of the Treasury
of this Territory "

SIR, I understood from you the other day in a conversation I had
the honor to have with you, that a discretionary power had been
given to Col Clinch of the 4" Regt Infantry, to place the new mili-
tary post about to be established for the protection of the inhabit-
ants of Florida, in such a position as would be calculated to effect
that object, —I learn from the Adjutant General, that the order to
which you refered, had not reached his office, from which I am
induced to believe, there has been some mistake, unless it was issued
directly, from your department to that officer—The post where it
is now established is of no sort of use in protecting the inhabitants,
from the depredations of the Indians, or restraining them within
their boundaries—It is established 120 miles from their Northern
limit, leaving the whole country between Swanee, & St Johns, &
over the latter, exposed to the Indians—I shall shortly send an appli-
* Graham wrote Call, Dec. 21, 1826 (NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 18),
that Lafayette was willing to let Edmund Doyle have the quarter section of the
Lafayette grant, which he had improved, for one-third down and the balance in
a year at $10 an acre. The Marquis had declined an offer of $5 an acre, but had
expressed a willingness to pay for the improvements. Call inquired on Aug. 11
(NA, GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee) what amount would be paid. Doyle
petitioned, Feb. 6, 1826, for remuneration for a tract improved under Spanish
laws, which had been ceded to Indian chiefs (House Journal, 19 Cong., 1 sess.,
pp. 223–234, 273). A letter from Call to Graham, July 8, 1828, concerned the
balance due to Lafayette from Doyle, who had informed Call that $600 had been
ordered to his credit at the U. S. Branch Bank at New Orleans (NA, GLO, Reg.
and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee).

That instead of enjoying this security, we have been wofully dis-
appointed in finding the Indians, to this day, spread over the Coun-
try, in the same manner as if no treaty had existed; and in the
consequences resulting from their roving habits. We are subjected
frequently and almost daily to the losses and alarms incident to
burning the woods, killing our cattle and hogs, stealing our corn,
potatoes and other provisions, and incessant intrusion on our farms:
and we regret also that in stating these grievances we should have
to add, that the Indian Agent is absent from the Territory.
Your memorialists are impressed with the belief that the white
people generally of East Florida, have borne the vexations of which
we complain, with a forbearance which cannot be considered by the
Administration in any other light than as highly creditable to them:
yet when we reflect that repeated collision is apt kindle into irrita-
tion, and that the encroachments of the Indians cannot fail to lead
to such a result: we beg leave most earnestly to urge on the atten-
tion of Administration the fatal consequences to which an excitement
of this sort may lead. and we ask that these consequences may be
averted, and that our persons and property may be secured, by the
entire removal of the Indians from Florida, or by such other measures
as the Administration may have it in its power to adopt.

DANIEL E. BURCH TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
WASHINGTON CITY, December 20th 1826.
GENERAL, I have the honor to enclose for your information a Chart
of the Mouth of Suwannee River in Florida taken by Capt. Baker of
the Transport Florida." In November last he had been ordered
thither to transport a Detachment of Troops from Pensacola intended
to occupy a Station on that River, but in consequence of the Shoals
was unable to get the vessel in. The Detachment then returned in
her to St. Marks from whence they Marched to the Suwannee Ferry,
a distance of nearly a hundred miles. This ferry is upwards of a
hundred miles by the course of the River above the Suwannee Old
Towns, which are about forty five miles above the Mouth of the River,
& are also the position it is expected the Troops will occupy, being the
principal crossing place for the Indians when entering the Settlements
West of the Suwannee River. To transport supplies for this detach-
ment, first by land to the Suwannee ferry, & then by the River to the
Post, will be attended with difficulty, delay, & great expense, & the
entrance to the River by Sea is barred by its numerous Shoals, so as
to render it unavailable by that Route for transportation.—If I may
be permitted the expression of an opinion it is that this Post, if estab-
lished, cannot have the desired effect of restraining the Indians. It
will be about eighty miles from the Indian Country, & not in the
vicinity of any white Settlements. It would prevent the entrance of
the Indians by that particular route only into the Settlements West
of the Suwannee; but will afford no protection whatever to the Settle-
ments East of the Suwannee.—From a personal knowledge of the
place too I am confident it will prove to be very unhealthy on account
of the Ponds & extensive Swamps near to it. A position at or near
the Indian agency would be more healthy, have the full effect of
restraining the Indians within their limits, & could be more cheaply
& easily supplied, even if the Supplies were carted there from Tampa
Bay.—

and that the State of Alabama will adopt the Same measure over
the Creek Indians residing within her boundary.
It Seems to me certain that if this policy is pursued, Florida will
become the theatre of war, and that a Strong Military force Should
be ordered into this Territory for the its protection in this event. The
Department will no doubt be apprised of the proceedings of the
Legislatures of Georgia and Alabama, and will promptly afford the
most ample protection to our Citizens
I have ordered out Several Companies of Militia who are now
in Service—a number of Indians have been Sent to their own Country
South—and but one Indian has been Killed Since I last wrote to you.
This Indian was one of the party Concerned in the murder of M"
Carrs family, in his pack was found Some of the Clothes that belonged
to the family—I have not yet heard from the Agency, nor from
Co” Brooke. Commanding at Tampa Bay—As Soon as the disposition
of the Siminole Nation is ascertained & Communicated to me, Your

Some provision Should be made for the Support of the Militia who
now are, and may in füther future be ordered into Service—
Thus far but little expence has been incured, Some Corn, pro-
visions and Amunition was purchased and distributed by my order,
the whole it is believed will not exceed $800 or 1.000 dollars.”

I have found it impracticable with any degree of accuracy to com-
ply with that part of your instructions which requires me to include
the Sales of Land under the pre-emption Law in the same return with
other Sales. It frequently occurs that after an entry is made, though
supported by the Strongest testimony, that the claim is impeached
and Shown to be fraudulent. Many of the claims acted on during
the last month are impeached, or contested by other claimants who
are now engaged in procuring testimony to Shew the incorrectness of
the claims which we have approved, and to establish their own right
[to] the Same land. Until these claims Shall have been Settled I have
thought it best to retain the papers, and inform you only of the amount
received under the pre-emption Law during the last month, which is
ten thousand ninety one dollars twenty nine cents. It is already
ascertained that a part of this Sum has been received on fraudulent
claims, and it will be my duty to refund the amount to the claimants
in these cases and take back my receipts
Under the pre-emption Law you will percieve Sir, that the Register
and Receiver have no power to Summon witnesses in behalf of the
United States, in consequence of which they are frequently imposed
on by interested and dishonest witnesses, who establish all that the
law requires to be proven when the claimant in reality has not the
Shadow of right. Unless the land Sales are postponed the office will
close against the pre-emptioners after the first monday in next month,
immediately after which all the cases arising under that Law will be
reported to the department. Some of the pre emption cases reported
in my last return have lately been impeached and I have to request
that the patents in all cases arising under this law may be suspended
until the office is finally closed

To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America, in Congress assembled—
The Memorial of sundry Inhabitants of Key West, and Persons
engaged in wrecking and fishing on the Coast of Florida, most respect-
fully represent:
* The best printed text of this treaty is in Hunter Miller (ed.), Treaties and
other International Acts of U. S., II, 318–345. Andrew Ellicott was the com-

That Key West is situated immediately on the Gulf of Florida in
24'24” North Latitude, about midway between Cape Florida and
the Tortugas Islands, and seventy eight Miles North half East from
the City of Havana, That it possesses one of the best and safest
Harbours in the Southern Section of the United States, where Vessels
of all Classes can enter and depart at any time, even without the aid
of a Pilot, and from its local advantages generally, bids fair to become
a place of great importance, not only in a commercial, but in a political
point of view to the United States.
That wrecked Property to a great Amount has been brought here,
and disposed of under various Laws and regulations of the Territory,
which in many instances has not only given great dissatisfaction to the
Owners of the Property, but to the Salvors. That the distance from
hence to Pensacola, St Augustine and Charleston is so great (the
nearest being four hundred and fifty Miles) that carrying wrecked
Property from the Reef to any of those places would be attended
with great delay, risk and Trouble, and in many instances could not
be carried there at all, on account of the perishable state in which it
is frequently found, and in most instances the Wessels wrecked, could
not be sent away at all, as they are generally in such a cripled state
that they cannot go to Sea with safety—
That at present when Property is saved, there is no Tribunal on
the Coast that has any controul over it, and it can be carried away
by the Owners, in defiance of any thing that can be done by the Salvors
or Inhabitants, as has already been the case in some instances
That the Revenue collected here from wrecked Property and
otherwise, within the last two or three years, has amounted to up-
wards of One hundred thousand Dollars as can be seen by having
reference to the Returns made by the Collector of this Port.
That there are at this time between Forty and Fifty Wessels engaged
in wrecking and fishing on this Coast, the most of which belong to the
Atlantic Ports of the United States.
That the County of Munroe of which Key West is the Capital,
contains a population of five or six hundred Inhabitants, the most of
whom get their living by wrecking, fishing and Turtling, and for the
want of a Court or proper Tribunal, the Revenue Laws of the United
States are liable to be daily violated, as by sending a Wessel of the
class already described to Pensacola or St Augustine, for any alleged
violation of the Law, for adjudication, would be attended with more
Expence than the Property would defray, even in case of confiscation
That One hundred and fifty Wessels of various descriptions have
entered at this Port since the first Day of January last, as you will
perceive by an abstract from the Books of the Collector annexed

[December, 1826]
To the Honorable James Barbette Seeretary ef War Sir Senate & House
of Representatives in Congress assembled
The undersigned Inhabitants of East Florida and in the line of
communication between S" Augustine and Pensacola, beg leave to
represent, That the main road recently made between these places by
virtue of an appropriation from Congress, is in a condition so incom-
plete and imperfect as to be impassable." In its direction it has been
run unnecessarily circuitous, evidently to avoid expense in ditching &
causeways And in reference to the width which was contemplated by
law to be 25 feet, instead of this it is so narrow in many places as not to
admit of two carriages passing each other: where it runs through pine
land the trees and stumps are so imperfectly removed that they cannot

reported a bill to establish a southern judicial district in Florida, which was
laid on the table on the 28th (ibid., pp. 168, 252). See act approved May 23,
1828 (4 STAT., 291–292), authorizing the establishment of the court in question.
* Burch defended this road in a letter to the Quartermaster General of Oct. 3,
1826 (NA, WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File). He attributed the attacks on
the road to disappointment of those whose locations were bypassed by the route.
He enclosed letters from William Hort, Jacob Robinson, Judge Brackenridge, and
Col. Clinch commending his work.

be passed, and in places where the road leads through flat ground, the
ditches instead of being sufficiently continuous to serve the purpose of
draining, are cut in a manner so broken disjointed and slovenly as to
serve no good purpose whatever. Where the road runs through low
lands the few causeways that are made, are so narrow that a cart can
scarcely pass, and they have been constructed in so careless and im-
proper a manner, with logs and mud, that the holes and obstructions
render it dangerous for horses to pass them; and throughout the whole
line there is so miserly a deficiency in bridges and causeways as scarcely
to entitle it to the name of a road. Under these circumstances there-
fore we ask leave to suggest, that if upon due examination it shall be
found that there has been a misapplication of any part of the appropria-
tion for constructing this road, that the same may be directed into its
proper channel: but if the case should be otherwise, and that the whole
of the appropriation has been regularly applied, then we lament its
insufficiency for the object; for independently of the consideration that
ourselves and the rest of the community in Florida derive no advantage
from this road in its present imperfect and useless condition, in our
ordinary intercourse and communication; we are shut out from the
benefits which a well constructed road would naturally induce in a
new Country, in the increase of population and its attendant conse-
quences of increasing the value of private as well as public property.
And we beg leave to submit whether, if these considerations be not
sufficient to induce a further appropriation to compleat the road,
whether the interest of the United States at large does not imperiously
demand it, in having a free passage for waggons and munitions of war
between the several posts which this line of communication embraces.
We trust that these observations will be favourably received by
the Department Congress, and that measures will be adopted to
compleat this important line of communication."

SIR, Having received from the Department of War the several
despatches from the Governor of Florida concerning the late Indian
disturbances near the Alachua Settlements," I have determined after
full consideration to place the whole subject in your hands and invest
you with full power and responsibility for the defence of Florida.”
I have little doubt at present that the troops of your own Regiment
including the force at Tampa Bay will suffice for this object. If not,
the Company of Art” at St Augustine and after that, the Battalion
of the 1* Infantry at Pensacola will be subject to your orders. This
latter force however should not be diverted from its destination up the
Mississippi unless the emergences of the case shall imperiously
demand;—in deciding which, you will exercise a sound discretion.
In the measures you may think proper to adopt you will never lose
sight of the great objects of the Department of War, the defence &
security of the inhabitants from hostile aggression; but it is equally
necessary to observe, in your dealings, a constant and rigid deference
to the dictates of Justice. In this respect, it will be necessary to make

all due allowance for the agitated temper of the public mind with
regard to the Indians, and the deplorable straits which have driven
many of them to acts of violence or trespass, for which the main
body of the tribes may not be accountable. With our power, I hope
also that they may be made to feel our justice.—
It is confidently expected that, with the troops of the regular Army
at your disposal, you will be able to accomplish the object in view
without resort to Militia, unless demanded by a more serious crisis
than now appears.
You will communicate frequently with these Head Quarters and
freely with the Executive of Florida;—and make such requisitions,
from time to time on the Quarter Master General's & Subsistence
Departments as the emergences of the service may require.—
General Gaines is to be expected soon in Florida, and in the event
of his arrival near you, you will exhibit to him this letter and receive
his further directions.”—

GENTLEMEN, I enclose a copy of my letter addressed to you on the

Legislative Council," and which are this moment received, that you
will have postponed the public Sales. In which event you will give
notice that the lands which are now proclaimed for sale on the 15th
Inst, together with the following townships and fractional townships
will be proclaimed for sale on the 3" Monday in May next.”
The persons who have claims to preemptions, within the Townships
now proclaimed for sale, will of course have a right to complete their
Title to the same until within two weeks of the period at which they
may be reproclaimed.—And if it should so happen that a portion of
the lands proclaimed may have been offered previous to the receipt
of this, and there should be within such portions, lands claimed as
preemptions which have not been sold at such public sale, I have to
request that you withhold from private entry all such lands until
further advised.
It is to be understood that the claimants to preemptions have a
right to complete their titles to the same, and make payments at any
time within two weeks previous to the periods at which the Township
within which such claims lie, are proclaimed for sale."

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL 20
[NA:SF, 19 Cong., 2 sess.: DS 21 |
[January 6, 1827]
To the Senate and house of Representatives of the United States in
congress assembled
This memorial of the Legislative council of Florida, humbly repre-
senteth, that under your patronage they have beheld our Territory
prosperously situated, increasing in population and gradually de-
veloping those resources of wealth, with which she is by nature so
lavishly endowed.
With due gratitude for past favours, your memorialists from a
belief that the General Government will ever conceive the growth of
Florida intimately connected with the prosperity of our rising re-
public, have again presented themselves as petitioners before you,
and ask that relief only which Congress in its wisdom may deem
expedient to grant
Your memorialists represent as the most serious grievance which
afflicts our Territory the present location of the Indian tribes within
our boundary; but above all, that they have been permitted to roam
through the country, plundering those whom their avarice might
seize on, and murdering those whom their revenge might select
The tract of country assigned them by the treaty of 1823 * has
always been complained of by them, as incompetent to their support,
and the additional grant subsequently made them, has been the
occasion of much dissatisfaction among many of our citizens: and
probably not without cause; In addition to this, the present location
ef is in the pathway of our settlers, and has already seriously im-
peded the settlement of the fairest part of Florida, and will now
cloud all its prospects. The land in this vicinity is excellent; and
but for the obstruction of this impertaht unfortunate, though not less
obnoxious tribe of beings would before this have borne on the current
of the St. Johns, all the rich and luxuriant products of a tropical
climate; besides they have never gone within their boundary but have
scattered themselves in different parts of the Territory, and to the
great annoyance of our citizens they have stripped the corn from
our fields before our eyes; they have burned our houses, and murdered
our citizens. All this they did, and have been doing for the last season

within twenty miles of the walls of St. Augustine and with impunity.
But more recent outrages have been committed which has thrown a
damper on the spirits of our agriculturists, and present our country
under a gloomy aspect. The most inhuman butcheries have been
committed by them; a whole family has fallen a sacrafice to their
vengeance, and individuals have been murdered while on the highway
and engaged in that industry which constitutes the soul and energy
of our country; our corn houses have been broke and plundered; our
cattle killed, and our citizens driven from etir their homes, and
threatened with all the horrors of Indian cruelty within the space of
the last two months, and within forty miles of our capitol. The
vigilince of our Governor, and the prompness of our Militia have for
the present checked their outrages, and in some degree, quieted the
fears of our citizens, but at what time and in what place, the bent
bow, will let slip its arrow, the blood of our citizens will we fear, soon
proclaim. In this gloomy situation of our Territory, your memorialists
beg the speedy removal of these people out of the Territory. If
they are dissatisfied with their present situation as appears, if they
have never complied with the stipulations of their treaty as is mani-
fest, if they have been guilty of the most glaring and unprovoked
outrages, certainly, they have forfeited their claim to humanity, and
are the fit subjects of our policy. We most earnestly recommend
that they be forthwith, called to their boundary; and commissioners
appointed to hold a new treaty with them, stipulating their immediate
removal, from the Territory to the Indian Country West of the
Mississippi, and that the commissioners be vested with full power to
carry the same into execution.” It is not to be forgotten that these
Indians have already cost the United States more than one hundred
thousand dollars, and that their present condition requires another
appropriation, or else they will be compelled to have resort to unlawful
means for subsistence.
Your memorialists would further recommend, that a regiment be
ordered to some point on the St. Johns, at as early a period as possible,
for the protection of our frontier settlements, which are in that region
entirely unprotected. Especially do your memorialists urge the adop-
tion of this measure since it is by some confidently believed, that the
Nation is bent on war, whether true or not, your memorialists will
not pretend to determine, but nevertheless do unhesitatingly say,
that their present movements, have a suspicious aspect.
The Council beg leave to call your attention to another subject
intimately connected with the prosperity and settlement of the
* See resolution of Jan. 4, 1827 (House Journal, 19 Cong., 2 sess., p. 123),

country; and dependent entirely on the will of congress; it is the
erection of a tribunal for the adjustment of land claims in East
Florida. The great delay which has attended the fulfilment of that
part of the treaty on the part of the United States, has been an incal-
culable impediment to emigration, and the cause of much distress
and disappointment to our citizens; large purchases have been nego-
ciated, conditioned on the confirmation of the Grants, by the United
States, which are now in the same state of uncertainty that they
were four years ago. this has kept the capital, both of the speculator,
and the land holder, idle, and in numerous instances has prevented
the introduction to the Territory of slaves, and by consequence has
kept the resources of the country unemployed, it is further repre-
sented for the information of Congress, that it is believed the unad-
judicated lands in East Florida would support a population of twenty
thousand individuals, and it is most confidently asserted, that the
delay in settling these claims has kept out of the Territory, more than
ten thousand emigrants, that before this would have been settlers in
it but from, the fact that they were unable to obtain safe titles to
lands they had selected to settle on; either from the United States
or private individuals without being judged importunate, Your memo-
rialists press on Congress the consideration of this subject, at as early
a period as practicable.”
Your memorialists beg leave to call the attention of congress to
another subject intimately connected with the interests of this Terri-
tory, and in different relation to the United States deserving their
attention; it is the establishment of a judicial district, at or near Key
West, a court at er hear with with the same jurisdiction of the other
Superior Courts in the Territory established at this place would afford
great protection and relief to commerce, by the speedy interposition
of the laws of the United States in cases of wrecked property; It is
not to be forgotten that the revenue to the United States from the
customs at this place during the last year amounted to a sum exceeding
sixty thousand dollars.
At present there is no protection to individual rights in that section
of the country or measurably so, partly from the mixed character of
the population that might be expected in such a situation, and partly
from their great distance to any high court. It is also stated that
there are at, or near Key West, a population of about three hundred
souls, and whether fixed or transient, should be controlled and gov-
erened by the penalties of law.
By an act of Congress, the secretary of the Treasury was author-
ised to select two entire Townships of land, one in East, and one in

West Florida for the endowment of a college.” Your memorialists
beg that so much of the law as requires that these Townships should
be selected, one in East, and one in West Florida, and that they shall
be selected entire be repealed, and that they executive of the Territory
be allowed to select the same in fractions or parts of sections and where
he may choose provided such selection shall not interfere with the
rights of any individual; The reason is obvious, because under that
law the Territory would receive little or no advantage from the appro-
priation, and the intention of Congress would be defeated, for in
neither section of the country can be found good land enough un-
claimed by individuals and in one body to include the donation.
Your memorialists think it their duty further to state, that in the
present situation of the Territory, a requisition of two hundred stand
of rifles and the same number of muskets to be at the disposal of the
Executive for the use of the Territory, would be of infinite importance,
this is recommended for a great variety of reasons, the principal of
which are, the more effectual organization of the Militia, and to re-
lieve our poor inhabitants from the expence of arming themselves in
those cases of inability which often occur
Your memorialists would call the attention of Congress to another
subject. By an act of Congress approved 24th. May 1824 One quarter
Section of land was given to the Territory for a site on which to locate
a permanent seat of Government, to be sold, and the proceeds to be
appropriated for the erection of public buildings.” In conformity to
this act, the quarter section was located and sold, and the funds
appropriated to the erection of a capital, which is now in a state of
progression. By the same act the Executive of the Territory was
authorised to select three other quarter sections to be reserved from
sale at the general sale of land in East Florida, these reserves were
made
Your memorialists respectfully request that Congress would by
special act grant these reserves to the Territory, to be appropriated
as the Governor and Legislative council may deem most conducive
to its present and future benefit this is more especially requested at
this time, since it is believed that at no period could the liberality of
Congress be extended with as many arguments of the necessity and of
as much certainty of advantage as the present presents.

the Legislative Council the appointment of all officers, civil and of the
militia, not otherwise provided for by law.” The people desire the
privilege of electing all their county officers except the Judges of the
Inferior courts; and as this is a subject of little or no importance to
the public at large, your memorialists conceive no impropriety in
the ehange can be supposed in this change”
Your Memorialists further represent as a great impropriety, that
officers appointed by the United States, to fill offices within this
Territory for example the district Attorney and Marshal of Middle
Florida, who have for the term of two years received the emoluments
of the same, and have never resided a day within a hundred miles of the
district in which their duties were to be performed.
1** Your memorialists further represent as a grievance, several
provisions in the organic law of the Territory passed by Congress in
1826.” one of which is the law preventing the Judges of the Superior
Courts from being required to hold a court but in one other place in their
respective districts, than the one assigned by the law of the United
States. This law seems to have had its origin in a mistaken knowledge
of the true interests of the people of this Territory, and to have been
adopted in direct opposition to their unanimous voice. Your memorial-
ists are constrained thus plainly to speak because they are anxious
and determined to lay before you the glaring oppression of this law;
why the Judges of the United States courts should be discharged from
that duty they are paid to perform, and why your obedient citizens
should thus be laid under tribute at the expence of that tribute
subsistence they owe themselves and their families, are questions we
are unable to solve. The inconvenience and distress occasioned to
your citizens is easily conceived when it is known, that under the
present restriction, suitors and jurors may be compelled to attend
court at a distance of one hundred and fifty miles from their homes;
In some instances individuals have been under the necessity of selling
their horses and cattle to defray the expences of attending a court
where they had no business; we most earnestly desire that this restric-
tion on the Legislative Council in the organic law, may be recinded,
and we do with due deference to your decision think that the Legisla-
tive power of this territory would never impose an unjust duty on any
public officer, or misrepresent the true interests of their constituents.”

Another change is prayed for in the organic law which makes the
marshals of the districts the ministerial officers of the courts, and gives
them all the duties of said officers whether arising under the laws of
the United States or of the Territory. Your memorialists think it a
matter of much indifference to congress whether the business of our
courts arising under the laws of the Territory be done by a United
States or Territorial officer, and that under this view of the subject
congress would gratify the people whose innocent prejudices in a free
government should ever be regarded by giving them this prerogative,
this part of the organic law was adopted in direct opposition to the
avowed will of the great mass of the people
Your memorialists for the information of Congress recommend the
erection of a light house at some point at, or between St. Marks and
the Appalachicola: and also one at the mouth of the St. Johns,”
The commercial interests of the community require and have seriously
suffered for the want of these guides at these places and especially
at the latter
We also strongly recommend the establishment of a custom house
at Jacksonville on the river St. Johns; And for these reasons, that it
will be a great relief to ship masters coming from a foreign port; who
are now compelled to travel from forty to fifty miles to enter their
vessels, and because it is a place of considerable enterprize. Another
reason why this point is recommended in preference to any other, is
partly the healthy situation of the place and its commodious distance
from the mouth of the river, and partly because it is the centre of
navigation in East Florida
On the subject of the florida canal, your memorialists deem it
scare necessary to touch; but in passing cannot but acknowledge their
gratitude for the attention already bestowed on that important sub-
ject by the wisdom of congress, and most anxiously wait their decision
And finally under the liberal patronage of the General Government
we think the prosperity of our Territory will outstrip the anticipa-
tions of its warmest advocates. The representations of the enemies
of our Territory that it was barren and worthless, have already been
refuted by the agricultural experiments of our yeomen; and when
the great variety, and facilities of our soil and climate shall be properly
developed all those erroneous opinions will be corrected.

In explanation of the cause which has delayed the answer to your

I have to assure you that I will not allow an hour to pass that can
be made applicable to your communication, without employing it
for that purpose.
With every disposition in the Department to secure justice to the
Citizens of Florida, by a restoration of their runaway slaves, it is not
known how any steps can be taken except such as are authorized by
the intercourse law of 1802. An express order was issued to the agent,
on the 28* Feb* * last, in relation to this subject. It is not known
what effect his late absence from the Territory may have had in delay-
ing its execution; but now that he is about to resume his duties it is
to be hoped the proper steps may be taken to recover the Slaves, and
give them back to their proper owners.
Would it not be advisable for all concerned to forward descriptive
lists to the Agent? It would doubtless facilitate the recovery of their

The appropriation in question, however, was actually made by an act approved

In regard to your purpose “shortly to send to the Department an
application, for the losses sustained by the inhabitants from the
Indians,” I am directed to state that every possible attention will be
paid to such application; but to suggest whether the objects of the
applicants would not be more readily subserved by passing these
claims, as is customary, through the hands of the agent, or the Gov-
ernor of the Territory, whose duty it would become to examine and
report them to the Department with such testimony as might be
adduced in their support—And especially so as they will have to be
tested by the intercourse Law of 1802," it being the only authority on
which the Department can act in regard to claims of any kind, whether
these relate to spoliations committed by the Indians on the whites, or
by the whites on the Indians.
The Secretary regrets that any portion of the Citizens of Florida
should suffer by the depredations of those unfortunate people, and
would be happy, as he believes their own interest would be subserved
by it, to promote any proper measures that may be devised for their
removal from Florida into a Country where they would be at once freed
from the temptations to depredate which the supplies of their more
provident neighbors set before them; and from all occasions, it is to be
hoped of future wants, and sufferings.
On the subject of the notice taken by the Grand Jury of the Superior
Court of East Florida, of “the manner in which the Indians are per-
mitted to overrun the Country to the great injury and alarm of the
inhabitants,” " I am directed to state that every measure of pre-
caution has been taken, and instructions duly issued by the Depart-
ment to ensure a fulfilment of the stipulation in the Treaty which
provides certain limits for the Indians, and to insure their occupancy
of the same; and it is with regret that the measures adopted in con-
formity to those instructions appear not to have proved successful.
I am directed to state also that the memorial of certain planters and
Citizens of East Florida lying South of S*Augustine, to the President
of the United States has been read by him; * and that the causes of
complaint have heretofore, as stated, been attempted to be removed.
In the first instance to provide the Indians with the means of subsist-
ence until they could provide something for themselves, he ordered
Governor Duval to expend at one time two thousand, and at another
five thousand Dollars from the Contingent fund of the Indian Depart-
ment; and that subsequently the Congress provided 20,000$ for the
same object.” These provisions it was hoped would have kept these

suffering people quiet, until, by the adoption of other measures which
were directed, they would have been settled within the limits assigned
to them by the Treaty, and made something themselves on which
to subsist when the cause of the complaint now made would have
ceased. That these measures should have failed, is a source of regret,
to the President, who will be happy also in carrying into effect any
measure that may secure to the Citizens of Florida a freedom from their
present relation to the Indians, of that Territory, and the Indians a
home that shall not have connected with it so many temptations to
pillage; and where their wants may be supplied by the bounties of
nature, and in a Country that shall promote alike their own happiness
and the peace and security of our border population.

SIR I have the honor to transmit to you a copy of a report from the
sub agent Oren Marsh on the subject of the disposition and temper of
the Seminole Indians.” I am convinced that the Mickasukee tribe
are hostile, and that they never will remain within their limits except
by force—no other part of this nation has given so much trouble as
this tribe, I know them well and can assure you they are most aban-
doned and lawless Indians. They will do mischief if not intimidated,
and I must advise that a competent milatary force be stationed near
the agency. I have found it necessary to order out the sub agent
Maj. Phagan with another party of the Apalachicola warriors, to
arrest all wandering indians west of the Suwannee,” Maj. Phagan is
an excellent man and valuable officer, he divided his party and with-
out doing any injury to Indians he succeeded in driving out of the
Ocilla Swamps the Indians who were concerned in the late murder,

concerned in or knew of the murder committed on the two Paris:s
lately murdered in Georgia. I hope from these prisoners to obtain
the necessary information the whole of the party that were concerned.
The militia and Indians who were called out have behaved well and
are all discharged. No other Indians than those I reported to the
Secretary have been killed or injured—and those were part of the
company who murdered M. Carrs family. The prisoners here are
treated with humanity, but are strongly guarded, and will be exam-
ined in a day or two—when I will communicate to the department any
information, which may be obtained deserving of notice.
Owing to the recent troubles the expences of the Indian department
have been greater than would otherwise have been.” But the Secre-
tary will see that the state of affairs did not permit me to consult him
on the subject of the expense as it was unexpected, and delay might
have been as injurious as it would have been imprudent. I have no
fear of general hostilities, but danger is apprehended from the maraud-

agent shews that from these indians our frontier settlers have much to

[NA:GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee:LS]
Land Office TALLAHASSEE 10th Jamy 1827
SIR In anticipation of the public land Sales directed to be held
at Tallahassee on the 15" Ins" on the 1* day of this month we closed
our Office against the pre emption claimants. This we deemed to
be our duty under the provisions of the act of the 5* Feb 1813, which
requires “that all lands to be sold by virtue of this act shall be entered
with the Register at least two weeks before the time of the commence-
ment of the public Sales in the district where in the land lies.”" The
term “district” in the commencement of that act, as well as its Sub-
sequent introduction in the proviso, we concieve can only be applied
to the Eastern and Western Land Districts of Florida, and not to the
Townships proclaimed for Sale. If the Sale should actually take
place on the 15" Inst, we shall be bound by the law so far as we are
the judges of it, to consider all the unadjusted claims bared by its
operation, and we shall await the further instructions of the Depart-
ment on the subject. The claimants have had timely notice of our
view of the law, and have generally governed themselves accordingly.
Our Office was crowded for weeks immediately preceding the time we
had appointed for closing it. the Q#ee. A few of the persons en-
titled to the right of pre emption were unexpectedly called out against
the Indians, in consequence of which they were eempelled te unable
to make their entries two weeks before the time appointed for the
public land Sales. These persons we have since permitted to make
their entries Sihee that time, believing that the measure would be
approved by the Government. You will percieve from our returns
that the numerical order of our receipts and certificates has been is
greatly disarranged, but this is a dificulty which we have found it
impossible to avoid. It has frequently occurred that claims Sup-
ported by the fairest and most undoubted testimony, in the first
instance, after being entered have been impeached, and on a reexami-
nation we have been compelled to reject them.
Having no power under the law to Summon witnesses in behalf of
the U. States we have been compelled alone to act on the exparty
testimony of the willing witnesses introduced by the claimants.
In every instance we have endeavored to execute the law agreeably
to our understanding of its provisions, and the instructions of the De-
partment on the Subject, but we regret to inform you that we by the
mandate of the Judge of the Superior Court of this district we have
been compelled to act in total disregard of both. The act of the 5*
612 STAT. 797-798.

of February 1813 as well as the orders of the department requires that
the entries under the pre emption Law shall be made in entire q"
Sec" to be bounded by the Sectional and divisional lines, yet you will
discover from the writs of Mandamus accompanying many of our
receipts, that we have been compelled by the process of the Court to
permit entries to be made in 8" of Sections to Suit the convenience
of the Settlers, and the entries thus made are frequently in different
Sections, Townships and ranges. The opinion of the Court in this
regard though truly absurd is less exceptionable than in those cases
where there are two persons entitled to the right of pre emption
Settled on the Same Q Sec" We have been compelled to allow such
persons to enter thee Q Sections, though the law emphatically pro-
vides “that in no instance Shall any person be entitled to a preference
in the purchase for more than one Q Setion in addition to his portion
of the fractional Q" Setion on which he lives.” We are clear ea in
the Subjeet opinion that the term fractional Q Section is applicable
alone to the fractions made by the Surveyors of the land. and that
an entire Q Sec" containing its full compliment of one hundred and
Sixty acres, cannot become fractional by the Simple circumstance of
two persons Settling upon it, when the Settlement of one person would
not produce the same effect. Extraordinary as the opinion of the
Court on this Subject appears to us, we have conceived it to be our
duty to obey the mandamus and leave the department to exercise its
discretion in issuing or withholding the patent in Such cases. It is
certainly an abuse of the liberality of the Government which requires
correction. Fortunately the opinion of the Court on this point was
not given until a very few days before the office closed in consequence
of which there are but few entries made under this Singular decission.
It is very important however that the deeissieh opinion of the depart-
ment on this Subject Should be known as early as practicable, for if
the public Sales should not take place on the 15" Ins" the office, will
again be opened. There are yet many claims to be adjusted, and in
every instance where there are two persons on the same Q Setion,
(which is frequently the case, or may be made the case, when they have
the right by judicial decree, to Say that two 8" in different Sections,
Townships, and Ranges, form a Q Section) they will endeavour to
enter three Q" Sections instead of two.
We have the honour to be Very Respectfully Your Obt St

MY DEAR SIR I received a letter a few days since from my friend

of Florida was about to become vacant.” It will become Col: Whites
duty to recommend some gentleman in Florida, and I would not have
him to do otherwise. This sentiment, I impressed upon you when I
had the pleasure to see you in Washington on my way to this place.
I could not permit Col: White to endanger his bright prospects in
Florida by any act of frendship to me; and were he to exert himself
in my behalf, his constituents would very properly become dissatis-
fied—Yourself, and some other of my friends in Washington will
therefore confer on me the favour, of presenting my recommendations
to the Executive—A general letter, signed by every member of that
Branch of the Legislature to which I belong, may be regarded as expres-
sive of the wish of the State upon this subject; and I flatter myself
that there will be no difficulty in obtaining such a letter. I wa now
enclose it to you but it yet wants the signatures of a few o our Senators
who are absent from Richmond—Several of them will write letters
to their acquaintances in Washington—My friend M. Cabel" has
written to M'. Wirt to secure his influence in my favor. The appoint-
ment will not, I presume, be made immediately, and I shall have
time to send you such testimonials as my intimate friends here can
procure. They will entitle me to the appointment if it is given to
any gentleman out of the Territory—A letter from Judge Brooke"
to M Clay would be of service to me, and as I believe you are a rela-

the pleasure to know him, but he is now in Fredericksburg—Some of

* The Navy Department approached the live oak problem in different ways.
The Secretary ordered Melancton T. Woolsey, May 1, 1827 (NA, ND, SN Lets.
to Officers of Ships of War, Bk. 17), to plant live oak seedlings on the naval reserve
at Pensacola. Elias Wallen and William R. Taber informed the Board of Navy
Commissioners, May 8, 1827 (loc. cit., Bd. Navy Commrs., Misc. Lets. Recd.),
that they would not be able to deliver live oak timber according to their agree-
ment; they were given a new contract, July 1, 1827 (loc. cit., Contracts, Bk. 5).
And, finally, Charles Haire was appointed agent to investigate and mark live oak
areas in West Fla., Nov. 12, 1827 (loc. cit., SN Lets. of Appointment), informed of
his duties by the Secretary on the same day (loc. cit., General Let. Bk. 16), and

of the Arduous duties which have devolved upon them under the pro-

Congress, and that proper representation on that Subject would be
required to enable Congress to come at a reasonable equivalent—
I have been conversant with the duties of those offices since their
commencement, and can unhesitatingly say that they have been ardu-

such as required extensive proof and research in administering justice
to the claimants and the Government—

D SIR Having learned from an experiment of nearly two years
what the Offices of Register and Receiver are likely to be worth in
this district, we would represent that the Compensation falls very far
Short of all reasonable expectation both there and here and we deem
it a duty we owe to ourselves to call the attention of the department to
the Subject. Our returns to the G L. office will Shew what has been
received by us under the best circumstances that ever can occur and
[MS. torn]t will be found that after deducting a very reasonable
estimate for Keeping these offices the time is very near at hand that we
shall actually Sink money by them and that at the best they have very
little (if any) more than met the actual expences attending them, to
the North and West where clerk hire, boarding &" is very low it would
be very different, but there is more than one hundred per cent differ-
ence in regard to these expences there and here. Both our offices
require Clerks of the very first accuracy and respectability and it is
well Known that Such clerks in Orleans Mobile and other Southern
cities are getting from 700 to $1200 Pr. annum say $700
We pay for boarding $20 Pr. month 240
very indifferent office rooms rent for $10 Pr. month 120
For fires candles & incidental expences 100
$1160
And we might Safely venture to Say that considering the Small
portion of this little territory that is good land and the great proportion
of that that has been ocupied by preemptions and donations to indi-
viduals and public institutions that from and after the ensuing May
Sale we Shall according to the present arrangement be brought in debt
by them. We therefore hope th[MS. torn] the department will make
such represent[MS. torn] of this matter or take Such Steps as to place
[MS. torn] on a better footing we have no objection to a Safe limit

SIR. On the third day of the public land Sales we received by
express your letter of the 6" inst with its enclosures.
In Consequence of the representations of the Legislative Council *
we had Anticipated the postponement of the Sales, but as there were
many persons present at the time appointed who were desirous of
purchasing and as the lands first to be offered were generally of the
most inferior quality we Continued to offer a Small quantity each day
until the return of the express. Four townships only were offered in
the three days Sale very little of which was Sold and generally at the
Government Price. The Indian alarm was a very unnecessary One,
and had it not have been encouraged by the precipitation of the Legis-
lative Council the Sale would have been well attended and the lands
would have sold for good prices.
The Office will again be opened for the adjustment of Pre emption
Claims According to your instructions.
The lands remaining unsold together with those you have designated
in your letter of the 16" inst * will be immediately advertised for Sale
on the 3rd Monday of May Next. We enclose for the information
of the department a Copy of a Resolution of the Legislative Council

veyors Office we find that the greater Part of that tract of Country has
not been Sectioned in Consequence of which it Cannot at that time
be brought into market but as we Concur entirely in opinion with the
Legislative Council with regard to the great importance both to the
United States and this Territory in having a Population thrown into
that Part of the Country as early as Practicable and believing that
this Can only be done by Offering the lands for Sale on the 3rd Monday
of May next, we have agreed to assume the responsibility of inserting
in one Publication of the lands to be offered for Sale at that time the
following Townships Subject to the approval or disapproval of the
President,
In Range 7. Townships 4.5. 6. and fractional townships 7 & 8.
In Range 8. Township 4.5. 6. & 7. and fractional Townships 8: & 9.
In Range 9. Township 8, & fractional Townships 9. 10 & 11.
In Range 10. Fractional Townships 11 & 12. The greater part of
these lands are said to be poor tho' the fractional Townships Are
considered fertile and very desirable, You will at once Perceive the
importance of bringing these lands into market when you are informed
that except in the immediate neighborhood of this place there is not
an inhabitant east of the Meridian and South of the base line.
The lands having been Surveyed will not populate until they are
offered for Sale as no man will risk his improvements on lands which
he may daily expect to be brought into market. The Sale of these
lands will immediately bring those in their neighborhood into notice
and will add much to their value, These Additional Townships may
be Considered by the department as forming too great a number to
be offered at one time, but when you Consider the large proportion of
poor land and the number of acres which have been & will be Covered
by Preemption Claims You will find there will not be more good
land Contained in them than the market will require. If there was
Sufficient time we would prefer Presenting the Subject to the depart-
ment before we make the advertisement but this not being the Case
we can see no possible injury which Can result from their being ad-
vertised as there is Ample time for us to receive the instructions of
the department on the Subject before the Sale *

[Enclosure]
Resolution to the President by the Legislative Council
[January 20, 1827]
Resolved That the President of the United States be requested
to cause to be offered for sale at the next Land Sales in this Territory,
All the Lands South of Township Six, Ranges Seven, eight, nine and
ten, S. & E. below the Basis Parrallel, which will bring into market of
Range Seven, Township Six, Seven and fraction of Townships eight;
of range eight, Townships, six, seven, eight and fraction of Township
nine; of range nine, Townships, six, seven, eight, and nine; of Range
Ten, Townships six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven and fraction of
Township twelve.
The reasons which induce the Legislative Council to deem this
course advisable, is the fact, that very few settlers have yet occupied
that section of country, and the Indians have been in the habit of
cultivating all the good lands in those townships, which has supported
large bodies of them so near the vicinity of the settlements of the
emigrant as to create considerable alarm among them; the late Indian
murders were committed by Indians who have formed part of these
settlers, and until the good lands of this section of country are disposed
of to actual settlers it will be impossible without a large Military force,
to keep the Indians from occupying it.
The lands upon the Stinhatchie river which waters some of these
Townships are good, and it is believed if they were offered for Sale,
would be immediately occupied, and form a barrier against the further
intrusion of the Indians. Those lands which form the remaining part
of these Townships are well adapted for grazing, and would be profit-
ably used for that purpose. From these reasons, it is believed that
their sale at this time would advance the interest of the Territory and
afford protection to our frontier settlers.
Therefore resolved, that the foregoing resolution, be transmitted
to the President of the United States for his consideration

TALLAHASSEE Jany. 23" 1827
DEAR SIR We have learned that at the passage of the preemption
law for Florida of of 1826 * an effort was made to get an appropriation
for carrying it into effect by us and that it was objected that it would
be impossible to say at that time what would be a proper compensa-
tion, we have acted on upwards of four hundred cases more than three *
of which has been confirmed these comprehend all as we believe that
are within the limits of the lands proclaimed for sale in this month
and some beyond those limits and shall be able to make report of them
by the next mail to the department, and not seeing how else Congress
can learn anything of the difficulties attending this business we have
thought it only proper to represent to you, that we were closely em-
ployed in this business at the office every day in the investigation of
these claims for about five months, and toward the close of the time
our office was kept crowded until late at night, we would represent
that besides the usual proofs necessary to prove their preemption
rights it involved the impeachment of Testimony in numerous cases
all of which had to be patiently attended to and these contested
claims had in most instances to be laid over from time to time to give
the parties an opportunity of getting additional testimony, and from
the circumstance of the surveys being made after these settlements
were made in perhaps half the cases two or more were thrown on the
same quarter section which entitled them to one or more q sections
of the nearest land of equal value and it was indispensable to have
proof that the quarters chosen in addition were the nearest of equal
value; this circumstance alone produced a great deal of Controversy
among the claimants, for the same tracts were wanting by others in
the same neighbourhood having also a right to lands of equal value
near them and these numerous cases presented continual difficulty
and labour. In fact it has been the most harassing and difficult and
disagreeable business that has ever fallen to our lot, nor was it in our
power during the whole time to attend to anything whatever apart
from the office.” We will also represent that it increases the duties of
our clerks beyond what they can well accomplish for which extra
service they have a just claim as it occasioned them to do a great deal
of their work in the night and if they are not remunerated they will

THOMAS L MCKENNEY Gen.' Super" of Indian Affairs
SIR Under the Command of Maj. Phagan the Sub Agent there
were three Indian Chiefs and fifty warriors—they arrested many
Indians, but injured none.
Their conduct was such as to meet my approbation, and their
services tended greatly to restore peace and order between the hostile
Indians and our citizens. I have given to them in presents for their
services $250 with my promise, as they expected something more to lay
their services before the Department. I will Suggest Sir, that Maj
Phagan ought to receive some Compensation for his arduous Services
in Commanding the Appalachicola Indians—he is a most valuable
Officer and deserves the patronage of the government—There is no
duty that he hesitates in performing, he is honest, active, and brave
The Indians were in Service 30 days—If the Department can allow
the Sub Agent the pay and emoluments of a Captain for one month for

DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 30th Jany 1827
To THE HON” THE CHAIRMAN of the COMM" of IND: AFFAIRs,
U. S. Senate.
SIR, I have the honor to accompany this with the copy of a letter
from Governor Duval to the Department; " and of one to him from
Oren Marsh, Sub-agent." From these letters may be inferr'd the con-
dition of the Florida Indians; and the high probability that they will
be unable, in the future, to derive a subsistence from either the forests
or the soil.
It will remain for Congress to decide what further provision, and of
what kind, ought to be made for the preservation of the Florida
Indians; and this disposition is made of the subject with a view of
possessing the Committee of a knowledge of the existing state of things,
and of enabling it to make such report to the Congress as the case may
require, either in a general provision for their removal to a more pro-
ductive Country, and which I esteem to be preferable; or in the event
of failure in such general provision such other measures of relief as
may be esteemed best. There can be little doubt but the Country is
inadequate to the support of those Indians.
* In another letter of Jan. 29, 1827 (NA, OIA, Lets. Recd., Apalachicola),
DuVal informed McKenney of the expense of $300 for expresses and $250 for
supplies for the Apalachicola Indians who served on the frontier. On Feb. 24,
1827 (loc. cit. Lets. Sent, Bk. 3), McKenney authorized the $250 and advised
DuVal that his accounts in this matter had been referred to the Auditor of the
Treasury.

GEN LAND OFFICE, 31 Jan 1827.
HON JOSEPH M. WHITE H R.
SIR, In reply to your letter of the 30" Inst,” requesting my
opinion as to the construction of the 3" Section of the Act of the 22d
April 1826,” relative to preemptions, I have to state, that alth" the
provisions of that Section allow as a maximum to each person entitled
to a preemption, who may be settled on the Same Quarter Section, one
quarter Section in addition to a portion of the quarter Section or
Fractional section on which he is settled, yet it does not necessarily
follow that in every possible case, the Register and Receiver would
be justifiable in allowing entries for the maximum quantity. On
this subject, I think the Act has invested the Register and Receiver
with discretionary powers, which will and ought generally to be
exercised in favor of the Settler, and allow to him the maximum granted
by law, yet there are many conceivable cases where the Officers may
be justified in refusing to grant them their certificates for this max-
imum.
I enclose for your information a copy of the instructions * given to
the Register and Receiver under the Act of the 23" April 1826, in
relation to the propriety of that part which confines the location of
entire legal quarter Sections, as fractional Sections, I refer you to the
provisions of the 1* Section of the Act passed the 5* of February
1813,” and to this construction of the Act, this Office will adher until
it be otherwise provided by law.”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF EAST
FLORIDA
[NA: HF, 19 Cong., 2 Sess.: DS *]
[January 31, 1827]
To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States, of America in Congress assembled.
The Memorial of the Subscribers, resident inhabitants of the
Eastern District of the Territory of Florida, respectfully sheweth.
That your Memorialists have viewed with pain and grief the course
of legislation pursued, on many occasions, by the Legislative Council
of this Territory.
At the late Session of the Council several acts were passed, which
your Memorialists consider as repugnant to the Constitution and laws
of the United States, and Subversive of the Soundest principles of
justice, law, and good morals.
Among these acts, your memorialists respectfully invite the atten-
tion of Congress to one entitled “An act dividing the Territory of
Florida into thirteen districts and providing for the election of members
of the Legislative Council,” ” by the eighth section of which, declaring
the qualification of electors, it appears that the Spanish inhabitants
of this Territory, who were residents at the time of the Cession of
Florida to the United States, are entirely excluded from the right of
voting at such elections.
Your Memorialists entertain the firm belief that it never was the
intention of the Government of the United States to deprive any
portion of the permanent population of this Territory of the elective
franchise; and desirous of cultivating and Supporting the utmost
harmony and good feeling between the native Citizens of the United
States and the ancient inhabitants of this Country, and that they
should enjoy, to the utmost extent, all the Civil and political rights
of Citizens of the United States, while resident in this Territory, your
Memorialists earnestly pray that Congress will, by a declaratory act,
place them upon the same footing as citizens of the United States,
in regard to those rights, and by that means put it out of the power of
the Legislative Council, in any manner whatever, to infringe their
rights and privileges, or render them in any degree questionable.
Your Memorialists cannot forbear to express their deep regret that
many of the acts of the Legislative Council passed at their late Session
should go into operation before they shall have received the sanction
and confirmation of Congress; and they respectfully pray that an act

SIR, I arrived here yesterday in eighteen days from Richmond,
which place I could not leave earlier than about noon of Jan 14* from
a variety of circumstances beyond my control. Indeed the accounts
of Indian disturbances on the line between Georgia and East Florida
by rendering it doubtful, for a short time, whether the Commissioners
could proceed in their work if arrived, seemed to me fully to justify
the short delay I made, in weather of almost unexampled severity as
to cold, while suffering an indisposition infinitely the most serious
for eleven years back.
I found lying at the Post Office here a packet for me containing,
relative relative to the claim of Baley" for Indian rations, several
papers, to the subject of which I shall devote a very particular atten-
tion before I leave Georgia and shall forward a report containing
all the information I can obtain, and my opinion, as soon as the duty

of running the line will permit me. The important packet containing
the papers from the Department of State mentioned in the com-
munication from that over which you preside, dated Dec. 23" has not
yet reached me. The report of the Commissioners” appointed under
the third article of the treaty of San Lorenzo el real * is a document
without which the Commissioners cannot well proceed. Since I
had the honor last to address yet the Department I have seen that
treaty and have procured a copy of Ellicots journal,” from which I
have the first information that the two extremities of the line to be
run have been geographically determined, and the Eastern which
was not certainly indicated by the treaty, actually marked, so as to
be readily and surely discoverable at this time. But I have no
evidence that the report made jointly by the two commissioners,
which by a provision in the treaty was to make a part of it of course
is now binding upon the United States and Georgia, does correspond
fully with what is stated in the journal. Still I cannot entertain a
doubt about that correspondence as the journal was prepared for the
press after the report had been received and acknowledged by the
two governments. Upon finding that the packet expected in conse-
quence of the communication to me from the Department of War
of Dec 23** had not arrived, I immediately enquired of the Governor
here whether the State or any individual possessed the report in
question and am informed that it cannot be procured here. On that
occasion I found that the journal of the United States Commissioner
Ellicot was here considered as sufficiently authentic, and that it was
expected I should proceed “in conjunction with the representative of
the constituted authorities of Georgia” to run a straight line from
the mound thrown up by the two commissioners at the outlet of the
waters of the Oko-a fon-ooka swamp into the S*Mary's river, to the
junction between the Chatahooche and Flint branches of the Apalachi-
cola river, which line was to constitute the permanent boundary
between the State of Georgia and the territory of Florida. The
commissioner for Georgia is at his residence in Darien 170 miles from
this place. I shall set out for that place on Sunday or Monday next,

my horses requiring that much rest before I can resume my journey
with certainty of the performance from them which is requisite.
I have only to assure the Department that there shall be no want of
diligence or fidelity on my part upon the occasion, but I cannot omit
to remark that the expense of the work must be greatly increased
from the necessity of proceeding without money there being only 80
dollars in my hands at present. If the report of the Comm” in 1800
should not reach me in time I shall be under the necessity of proceed-
ing by Ellicot's journal but shall be very exact in the application of
the information it contains, as a very little deviation might leave on
the Georgia side of the line some of the most valuable parts of the
great Ooka-fon-ooka swamp, in which besides its capacity to undergo
general draining there are some of the most fertile lands of all the
South, appearing like islands, or rather Oases, in the marshy desert.
Nothing requisite shall be neglected so as to allow of any disagreement
between that terrestrial arch of a circle which is already the geographi-
cal line, and the future boundary of jurisdiction, its constituent,
which is now to be traced and marked. The Eastern extremity is
considered here to be in Latitude 30°. 34’ . 48’’. I am not yet
informed what means are contemplated by the Georgia party for
connecting the compass line so as to ensure its correspondence with
the terrestrial arc, but I cannot try it my astronomical instruments
for the purpose being in their possession, nor does it seem to be ex-
pected here that any such means will be used. I do not pretend to
be a practical astronomer having never had it in my power to procure
the necessary instruments to qualify myself, but I have a sufficient
acquaintenance with the theory of the science to enable me to detect
all errors, and of course to guard against them. Nothing whatever
in the guise of advantage, or of the still greater temptation; relief,
could induce me to undertake what I did not feel an entire conscious-
ness of the capacity to perform. If I had escaped malicious insinua-
tions, predictions and constructions, I should have been surprized, in
the actual state of our public morals. It shall be my care to insure
the falsity of that future malice which I must as certainly incur as
I live.36

DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Off: Ind: Affairs, 3rd Feb 1827
TO THE HONble JOHN M BERRIEN
SIR, I have the honor in compliance with your request made of me
to day,” to state, that in my opinion it is not possible for a Sub-agent
of Indian Affairs to subsist, in Florida, at the present rates of living
in that Territory upon the allowance which the law provides, viz:
500 Dollars. My opinion is based on the returns which are made
from the Governor, who is Ex officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs;
and which show the prices of the means of living; and upon the fact,
that, to retain the services of those agents, of whom there are two—
Maj. Phagan and Oren Marsh, -the Governor has brought upon
himself an obligation of about two thousand Dollars, in furnishing
them with supplies, without which he writes they could not have lived.
The Hon.” The Chairman of the Commitee of Indian Affairs of
the Senate, self-moved, I mean without any recommendation, from
the Department, at least none is known to me, has very providently
proposed an increase on the Salary of Sub-agents, from 500 to 750$,
but this, as I see from the tenor of the bill, will be applicable to those,
only, who fill independent posts—I mean posts not within the limits
of a principal agency. Could the bill not be amended, so as to provide
for the same pay to the Sub-agents in Florida? indeed I think the
provision should embrace all.”
If necessary, I will send to you extracts from Governor Duval's
letters, which will be full on this subject.—

GEORGE GRAHAM TO THESECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets Sent, Bk. 18 *]
GEN LAND OFFICE, Feb 8 1827.
HON RICH* RUSH-
SIR. I now return the papers relative to the decisions of Judge
Woodward in relation to the preemption claims in Florida which had
heretofore been submitted to you," but returned with a request
that I would make out a statement, shewing the points on which the
decisions of the Judge interfered with the instructions from this
Office.
From a comparison of the instructions marked A." with the deci-
sions of the Court, marked B & C, it will appear that there are two
points on which the decisions of the Judge conflicts with the Instruc-
tions to the Land Officers.—
First. That the assignee in the meaning of the Act granting preemp-
tions * is, a legal representative, alth" the case referred to by
the Judge is as much against as in favor of his decision. I do
not consider this a question of such moment as to appeal from the
decision.—
Second. That the tract allowed as a Preemption may be located in
eighths of Sections. This decision is in opposition to the express
terms of the 1st & 2nd, Sections of the Act of the 5 Feb. 1813.
L. U. S. p 496," and to the practices and usages of this Office
under that Act.
The decision of the Judge it is presumed is founded on the provi-
sions of the 1st section of the Act of the 24 April 1820," which
authorizes the public Lands to be sold in half quarter Sections—
and this Act would have justified the decision, but for the proviso
to the 1 Section of the Act of the 5" of Feb. 1813. the 2'nd Section
of said Act & the evident intent & spirit of the Act giving the
right of Preemption passed the 1 Session of 19 Congress p. 26.

SIR, Frequent complaints have been made to the Department
respecting Slaves claimed by Citizens of Florida, which are in the
possession of the Indians; all of which have been acted on here, in
issuing such orders to you as it was expected would be promptly
obeyed—and lead to such investigations as should issue in fixing the
right of the Claimants, or establishing the contrary—and that these
proceedings would be followed by the proper reports to the Depart-
ment. Nothing satisfactory has been received of you.
I now, by direction of the Secretary of War, again call your atten-
tion to this subject, in a general way; and particularly in regard to
the claim of Margaret Cook; and require it of you forthwith to cause
the Negroes, claimed by her, to be surrendered to her upon her enter-
ing into a bond with sufficient security of which you will judge to
abide by the decision of such Tribunal as it may be esteemed proper,
by the Secretary of War, to establish to decide upon the claim.
You will at the same time satisfy the Indians of the propriety and
Justice of this course. Tell them the claim is set up; and that this
act is merely to secure the property until the right is decided, when if
it be in them they will be restored; and if, in th claimant they ought
not to expect to hold them.
It is expected of you to report generally upon such other like claims
as may exist in regard to Slaves."—

GENTLEMEN, The several communications of M" Call” furnishing
extracts from the decisions of Judge Woodward relative to points
arising under the Act granting preemptions in Florida,” were sub-
mitted to the Secretary of the Treasury,” who is not disposed to assent
to the correctness of any of those decisions, and he has therefore
instructed me" to request that you would cause appeals to be entered
in all cases where the decision of the Judge varies from your own view
of the Law, or the instructions you have received from this Office:—
One case of appeal on each point, will be sufficient to test the principle
with an understanding that the other cases are to await the decision
on the points on which the appeal is taken—
* Gen. Bernard submitted on Feb. 13, 1827 (NA, WD, CE, Bd. Inter. Improvts.,
Lets. Sent), a plan of operations for the spring which was adopted by the Chief
Engineer and issued in instructions to the Board (Mar. 12, 1827) reading, insofar
as Florida was concerned, as follows:
“The Board will commence its operations by the examination in Florida. At
St Augustine, Lt Col. P. H. Perrault will be ready, it is hoped to offer to the Board
a completed Map of his surveys. Should additional Surveys be necessary, in the
opinion of the Board, the Board will direct them to be executed by Lt Col. Perrault
and his Brigade without loss of time so that they may be completed early enough
to be used by the Board before the next Session of Congress.
“Before leaving Florida, the Board will examine the Harbour, Navy yard, and
vicinity of Pensacola, with a view to the defence of the Harbour and Navy Yard,
by means of fortifications” (NA, WD, CE. Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 3). See

As it respects the right of the party to a preemption under the law,
the decision of the Register and Receiver has been considered as
conclusive under the law, and no enquiry is made at this Office, on
what testimony it was granted—therefore no notice of this question
was taken in my instructions, except such as was precautionary—
The law inexpress terms requires, inhabitation and cultivation previous
to the 1* of January 1825, and if your own decisions on this point
have been controlled by the Judge and persons admitted to the right
of preemption under the law, who in your own opinion have no such
right, you will of course cause an appeal to be taken from the decision
of the Judge—And also in all those cases where under the control
of the Judge you have granted Certificates for preemption in eighths
of Sections. From the enclosed copy of my letter to the Secretary
of the Treasury you will perceive that the question in relation to
legal Representatives is considered as not a material one."
With regard to the appeal taken in the case of Judge Duval, I do
not understand whether it is taken on the part of the Land Officers,
in behalf of the Gov" or for the benefit of the Territory, in either
event however I am not sufficiently in possession of the facts, to give
an opinion on the subject. I request to be informed of all the facts
in relation to the selections & reservations of any quarter Sections for
the use of the Territory either by the Governor of the same or by the
Land Officers.”—

Georgia. and Florida, and Communicated to him the arrangements I
was about to make, to Carry into Effect the views Contained in your
Communication of the 4" Ult”,” A Copy of which I received in

Excellency, and he assured me, that when Carried into effect that he
felt Confident that they would give Protection and Security to the

to receive your Communication of the 6" Ultimo," and I have Com-
municated to his Excellency Governor Troup, the arrangements made

that Section of Country lying between Tallahassee and the Suwannee
River—Two Companies near the Florida Agency, charged with the
protection of the Country lying between the Suwannee and S" Johns
Rivers—Three Companies at Cantonment Brooke, with instructions
to protect that part of the Indian frontier lying on the Gulph, and to
prevent the Indians from passing into the Settlements through that
Channel—The Commanding Officer at S*Augustine is charged with
the protection of the Settlements East of the S" Johns—The Com-
manding Officers of these several Post have received instructions to
keep the Indians within their limits, unless they have a written
permission signed since the 1" of January, 1827, by the Agent for
Indian Affairs—On the arrival of the Company of the 4* Infantry
from Orleans, I shall have four Companies of the 4* Infantry at this

of Georgia, or to whatever point their services may be required—
From all that I have been able to learn I feel Confident that there is
no hostile intention on the part of either the Creek or Seminole
Nation, nor the least Concert between them—The outrages and
murders recently Committed in Georgia and Florida, were the Acts
of a few desperate Outlaws, three of whom it is beleived, have already
atoned for their Crimes, and efforts are making to have the others
taken and brought to justice—

SIR, I have the honor to inform you that after waiting at Milledge-
ville from Thursday 1" to Thursday 8* instant in the hope of receiving
a dispatch containing the report of Andrew Ellicot & Don Estevan
Minor made to Government by the former in 1800, which still appears
to me to be the only authentic document upon which the present
Comm" for runing the same Boundary line can proceed with entire
satisfaction to themselves, as the result of those operations as far as
it could then be obtained is obligatory and final, I repaired to this
place. Having now a strong belief that the packet with its important
inclosures has someway miscarried I have been engaged since Monday
Evening the 12* inst., when I first saw Mr Spalding, in making
arrangements for proceeding immediately to the performance of our
duty. A copy of the proceedings necessary before actual commence-

negotiation with the Bank of Darien made upon Tuesday the 13th
inst, has provided the funds requisite for commencement, and it has
been agreed that the work shall be performed at joint charge of the
two Governments by a single party under control of the two Comm”
acting in conjunction with precisely equal powers. I had the good
fortune to procure in Richmond the journal of Andrew Ellicot which
is completely in detail, and was prepared by him for the press after
the report was made. I have no hezitation under the actual cir-
cumstances to consider as entirely authentic what he there says was
the result of the joint operations of the two Commissioners and the
final agreement between them. I am allready assured of the complete
ostensibility of the mark which Ellicot says in his journal was made
in presence of the two Comm” by their joint order to designate the
Eastern extremity of the line. We have nothing therefore to do but
to run it so that it shall coincide as nearly as we can possibly make
it with the present Geographical line, the arc of a terrestrial great
circle, never yet traced and marked. From all the accounts hitherto
received by us, the Ook-fon-ooka swamp is absolutely impenetrable
by men bearing compass and chain, without first opening a Vista
and then making a foot bridge. We expect to have to depend upon
a traverse as we are not authorized to proceed in that only complete
but very expensive way. A competent surveyor could not be procured
in Georgia for less than 8$. a day, all expences paid besides. I could
have brought one from Virginia far superior to the best in this State
for five dollars. Having with much pains satisfied myself fully of the
thorough competency of the surveyor appointed by the authorities
of Georgia, I have consented to accept of him, allthough he is not at
all an astronomer and must proceed by geometrical means alone,
unconnected by any astronomical operation, which may answer
sufficiently well on the present occasion. His demand was ten dollars
per diem but I cannot consent to give more than 4$ for his compen-
dation from the United States. The men requisite will be engaged
from one dollar a day to 20$ the month, with the exception of two of
a superior order whose services cannot be dispensed with. The
whole provisions and other equipments must be procured in Savannah
and steps are allready taken for that purpose. Nothing whatever
can be had in or near the country through which the line runs, to which
we shall be confined at least 3 months. We could not make our
preparations even with a smaller sum than 1500$. Mr. Spalding

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF ST. AUGUS-
TINE AND EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 19 Cong., 2 Sess.:DS]
[Referred February 19, 1827]
To the Honourable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America, in Congress assembled.
The petition of the subscribers, resident inhabitants of the City of
St Augustine, and the Eastern district of the Territory of Florida,
respectfully Sheweth:
That your petitioners were all resident inhabitants of Florida at
the period of its cession to the United States of America, and many
of them natives of said County, but are not citizens of the United
States either by birth or by naturalization under the laws of the United
States.
That your petitioners have been impressed with the belief that in
virtue of the 6* Article of the Treaty with Spain,” by which the
Floridas were ceded to the United States, your petitioners were ad-
mitted to all the Civil and political rights and privileges of Citizens
of the United States; but your petitioners have lately understood
that this construction of the said treaty is not warranted by the
Constitution of the United States.
Nevertheless your petitioners have confidently relied on the pro-
tection of the Government of the United States for perfect security
in the enjoyment of their rights and privileges as such Citizens, equal
and coextensive with those of native and naturalized Citizens, under
the Constitution and laws of the United States.
But your petitioners, with the deepest pain and apprehension have
just learned that the Legislative Council of this Territory on the 11"
day of January Instant, passed an Act entitled “An Act dividing the
Territory of Florida into thirteen districts and providing for the elec-

tion of members of the Legislative Council” by the 8* Section of
which Act your petitioners are deprived of the rights previously
exercised by them, of voting at any election for members of the said
Legislative Council.” And your petitioners are seriously appre-
hensive that the said Legislative Council will, at their present Session,
also repeal that part of the Law of this Territory passed the 3" of
July 1823, by which the right of Suffrage is expressly secured to your
petitioners for deligate to Congress."
Your petitioners cannot forbear to express their astonishment at
this shameful outrage, on the part of the Legislative Council of this
Territory, upon the rights and the feelings of the ancient inhabitants
of Florida, and they confidently rely upon the justice and magnanimity
of the Congress of the United States to interpose a barrier against so
wanton and unmerited an Act of oppression.
Your petitioners pray, that Congress will, at its present session,
pass an express and a definitive law, by which the elective franchise,
in all cases in this Territory, shall be secured, beyond the control of
the Legislative Council, to all resident inhabitants at the time of the
Cession of Florida to the United States, and who, in other respects,
shall possess the same qualifications to vote at elections, as those
required from Native or naturalized Citizens of the United States.
And your petitioners will ever pray &c *—

DEPARTMENT OF WAR, 26th February, 1827
To THE HON” J. M. WHITE, of Florida, Ho: of Rep" U.S.
SIR, I have the honor in reply to your communication of [blank],”
made to the President of the United States, to state that the Presi-
dent is solicitous for the peace and safety of the Citizens of Florida;
and is anxious for the welfare of the Indians who reside there. He
is of the opinion that both would be promoted by the removal of the
latter to a Country more congenial to their habits, and better adapted
to supply their wants. There are no means, however, at the disposal
of the Executive for the promotion of such an object. But as it is
believed from your statements from time to time made to the Depart-
ment, that the Indians are themselves desirous of removing, it is
considered that perhaps preliminary steps might be taken to embrace
their views on the subject of removal, and the terms upon which they
would agree to go. The President is entirely willing if it be your
pleasure, to engage in the trust, to refer the procurement of such
information, to you; * and if you shall find in the prosecution of
this Trust that a few hundred Dollars are required, to pay the expense
of agents in communicating with the Indians under your directions,
your bills for as many as five hundred Dollars, drawn on the Depart-
ment for such purpose will be paid.
Should it turn out that the Indians are willing to remove, the terms
on which they may agree to go can be embodied and signed by them,
and conditionally by you, when on their being received here, should
they be approved, they can afterwards take a more formal shape and
be embodied in a Treaty, the provisions for which will of course be
referr'd as usual to the Senate, and the Means to carry it into effect
to the Congress.
It is believed you would be safe in agreeing upon the following
outline—First, a Country to be given in exchange North of Arkansas
and West of Missouri, in suitable quantity, and to each Indian a

filed with the Commissioners. The 7” Section of this act has invested

and judicial—and for the due execution of which it will be indis-
pensably necessary that you commit the surveying & laying down of
the private claims, only to your most experienced & judicious Deputies,
in the fidelity & judgement of whom, you have the most implicit
confidence.—
My letter addressed to you on the 9" July 1824 *—with the Dia-
grams accompanying it, will have anticipated the necessity of any
of any further instructions as it respects the mode of connecting the
private surveys with the township lines, & giving to them and the
public lands in each township the proper sectional number.
The Commission for deciding on the private claims in East Florida,
being still open it will be unnecessary to take any immediate measures
for surveying the claims in that district, which have heretofore been
confirmed—Your labours at present, will therefore, be exclusively
directed to the survey of the private confirmed claims in West Florida,
and as these are not very numerous, and I beleive generally well
defined and well known, I trust you will be able to have them com-
pleted in a reasonable time and without much difficulty—For this
purpose I would recommend, that you divide West Florida, into such
number of districts as you may deem expedient, by natural boundaries,

that you assign a particular deputy to each of those districts, whose
duty it shall be to survey the private claims and connect them with
the township lines—That you give public notice of the name, residence
and time that such deputy will attend in each particular section of
the Country for the purpose of surveying the private claims, which
notice should include a copy of the 7" & 12* Section of the act now
forwarded.—
The 8" Section provides for the return of the surveys to the Register
& Receiver, this of course cannot be done until the township Plat be
completed—The public lands therefore in each township should be
Surveyed at the same time that the private claims within the same
are surveyed, if the land be of that quality which it is deemed expedient
to section off, and on this subject your deputies must be instructed
by you—The 9* Section requires those claims which you may think
improperly located or invalid from any cause, arising out of fraud or
otherwise, to be disignated on your plat in the same manner & having
the same sectional numbers as if they had been approved.
The 10* Sec: provides that the expence of surveying shall be paid
by the public—there will be an appropriation of ten thousand dollars
applicable to this particular object,” & which I presume will be suffi-
cient to meet all demands for the present year—but should your ex-
penditure necessarily exceed that amount, you will stipulate for the
excess to be paid from the appropriation for 1828–The lines actually
run between one private claim and another, or between a private
claim and the public lands; should be but once charged, unless it be
indispensably necessary to re-measure the same line twice,—Your
account for surveying, private claims will be kept seperate and distinct
from that for surveying the public lands, and where a line is common
to both, one half of the expence must be charged to each.
The 11" Sec: provides that no patents shall issue for interfering
claims, until there shall have been a legal decision—In all cases there-
fore of interference between private claims, where there may be any
doubt as to the priority of title, it will be prudent to run out all the
lines of each, but in cases where there is no doubt, or where the parties
agree it may be proper to designate the interference of the weaker
claim only by dotted lines on the plat.
Under the provisions of the 12" Sec: you will take care to designate
in the township Plats the claims referred to, so far as you are furnished
with or can procure the means of doing so.
A remittance of five thousand dollars will be made you immediately
after the appropriation is passed for surveying the private claims as
referred to above.—

I shall however come to the City as soon as a Secretary shall arrive
here to take charge of the Government—I have no expectation of

my appeal, I must either apply to the Attorney General or the Presi-

matter. An appeal to Congress may be necessary—but I think not—
I know that $5,00 is the Salary allowed to a Sub Agent, and his pay

what is right—It seems to me where the Secretary is satisfied it was
proper and right that a moderate provision should be made for these

Land Office, TALLAHASSEE 27* Feb. 1827.
SIR. We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 5* Inst" enclosing Sundry depositions in support of the claim
of Peter W. Gotier Jr to a preemption.
We regret to inform you that those depositions contain a very partial
and uncandid Statement of the facts, which you will readily percieve
from the enclosed copy of the testimony on which this claim was
impeached and rejected.”
It is a fact notorious in this country, and one well known to M*
White himself, that Peter W Gotier Jr never did reside in this Terri-
tory
It appears from the statement of Jacob Robinson that he owned
one or more of the Negroes which were employed on his fathers planta-
tion on Chipola, for which his father has actually obtained a preemp-
tion. It does not appear that Peter W Gotier Jr ever did either by
himself or Agent make any seperate distinct or independant improve-
ment from that of his father, and we are clearly of Opinion that he
has not even the Shadow of a Claim to a preemption.
The claim of Gotier Sen was only recognized by the most liberal
construction of the law, for he never has lived resided in this Territory
nor do we believe he is yet an inhabitant; but he had made extensive
improvements and had been a Cultivator of the Soil.
Jacob Robinson and James Webb two of the witnesses on whose
testimony the claim of Peter W Gotier was rejected are his personal
and devoted friends. Robinson is one of the nearest Settlers to the
place where he claims preemption, and well knew that the said Gotier
never had been an inhabitant of this Territory within the terms of
the Law
We have no doubt you will be frequently troubled on questions
of this kind; but we have the satisfaction to know that the documents
on file in our office will support the correctness of our proceedings,
and we believe that our Official conduct will bear the test of the
most rigid scrutiny. Our errors (for no doubt we have committed
many) have generally been in favor of the settlers claimants, and

you a caveat against the emananation of a Patent to Jacob Robinson
& Peter W Gotier." The preemption law passed April 18" 1826 *
had received a liberal construction from the Department, and the
Register & Receiver. Claimants were however confined to an
entire legal quarter Section and were not permitted to enter in eights
of Sections and no claimant was permitted to enter in his own right,
more than one quarter Section in virtue of this law, except in the
case where two or more had Settled and improved a fractional quarter.
In such case they were permitted to have a division of the fractional
quarter & each to purchase a quarter in addition. Such Settlers
coming as was believed by the Register & Receiver within the Provi-
sion to the 3"Section of the pre-emption law, The law was executed
in obedience to this construction until near the Close of the Office
when Jacob Robinson of Chippola (and whose improvements are
embraced by this location) brought a case by mandamus before the
Judge of the Superior Court for the middle district of Florida, requiring
the Register & Receiver to Shew cause and praying the preremtory
mandate of the Court to Command Those officers to permit him to
entertain his pre-emption. 1" in eights & 2", that where two or
more have Settled on & improved the Same quarter Section though
entire that they Should be entitled to a division of the quarter includ-
ing their improvements and each to an additional quarter Section.
It was resisted by the officers and Council for the asylum in argument
had before the Judge. In the course of which instructions from the
department were produced which were clear & positive upon both
points. It was insisted in argument that the term quarter Section
had a determined Signification which was to be found in the Acts of
Congress that in the use of the term Congress. had uniformly kept
up the Same Signification, that it was intended to mean Something
more than 160 acres of land that an equally important part of the
Signification is the particular manner in which it is to be bounded as
is Specifically Pointed out in the law. that the beginning to each
quarter was given by the Surveyor—that two eights of the Same or
different Sections was not a quarter Section within the meaning given
by Congress to the term, that though the two eights would include
the quantity yet boundary which is equally important under the
law, was not complied with The Second Section of the law of 1813
to which the preemption law of this Territory refers was adverted to
wherein it directs “The Same to be bounded by the Sectional lines

to obtain two eights adjoining which would be bounded on neither
Side by a Sectional line. These arguments taken with positive
instructions from the Department, it was contended Should be
Sufficient to Sustain the negative of the first point made in the Case,
particulary when it was recollected that a previous question had
been made to wit whether the Superior Court, could righfully exercise
a Superintendance & controul over these Officers and the Department
in the execution of the pre-emption law or whether Congress had not
made the Register & Receiver the Sole Judges as the law gave them
the power to adjudicate claims pass upon testimony &c & had provided
no appeal nor given to any jurisdiction a right to control them that
they were Sworn officers and must execute the law according to
their understanding of it; that it was necessary that he the Judge
Should be entirely satifyed that he had the right to control or dictate
to the officers in the discharge of their duties under this law and
that the construction contended for by the applicant is clearly Correct
to enable him to Sustain and enforce the position. As to the Second
point, it is clear from the law itself that the case above alluded to was
the only one under this law where the Claimant or Settler would be
entitled to a preference in becomeing the purchaser of more than
one quarter Section of land. To this it was answered that in case two
or more had Settled upon the Same quarter that they were by the law
entitled to a division of the Same to be made by the Register &
Receiver which division when made would give to each the fraction
of a quarter and although the term fractional quarter Section had a
technical meaning known and in use in the Surveying and other
departments yet that this law was to be liberally construed against
the government & in favour of the Settler and that the division
above mentioned would bring those Settlers in the provision to
the 3” Section of the pre-emption law and of this opinion was Judge
Woodward—he gave his opinion for the Applicant on both points
and gave the order for the pre-emptory mandamus to issue which
was done and obeyed by the officer. I enclose a copy of the mandate
as it issued in favor of Jacob Robinson and another in behalf of
Peter W Gotier. I have felt it my duty to lay this matter before you

& guidance-
From a memorial presented to Congress by the Legislature of
Florida,” I am apprehensive that much difficulty is about to arise
under the decision of Judge Woodward in relation to the reserved
Sections as located by the Lieut. Governor-In addition therefore
to the cases referred to in my previous communications it will be
proper and necessary that you appeal from any decision given by
Judge Woodward which shall go to invalidate the last reservations
made at your Office by the Lieut. Governor and which tracts so re-
served were witheld by you from sale in conformity to such reserva-
tions—
I understand that one among other objects is to claim the quar-

The application to his Excellency was entirely irregular, and must
have originated in misconception. The Bond in question was given
in 1822, under a Law of the Territory, authorising the appointment
of Keepers of the public Archives, and was of course made payable
to the Governor & his successors. Maria Machado was one of the
sureties of the present Keeper of the Archives upon this Bond, which,
however, expired by the operation of the act of Congress passed 3d
March 1825, requiring that officer to give Bond in a penalty of
twenty thousand Dollars. and authorising the President to commis-

reason to believe that madame Machado had the least ground to
apprehend any mismanagement in his office. About the time when

of a letter. If “letters are mailed at y' office addressed to persons
entitled to receive them free,” when you can discover that they
enclose letters to persons who are not entitled to that privilege, you
cannot ascertain, without an unlawful investigation, that the enclo-
sures are not on the business, personal or official, of him under whose
frank they are conveyed. The law provides, that in case of improper
enclosures of letters, it shall be the duty of the person to whom they
are enclosed to correct the error by returning them to the P. O. to be
marked with postage; & the fulfilment of this duty must be confided
to his own sense of propriety & moral obligation. When this is not
done, the fair presumption is, that their franks cover nothing but what
is the proper subject of their franking privilege; & on this, it is safest
to let the subject rest.”

7000$. There can be no doubt but this amount has been applied by
you to the purposes of your Agency—but it is equally certain that it
has been so applied without Authority. I need not add that such a
mode would soon involve the Department in inextricable difficulties.
It can best judge, and alone jude, what can be sent for the purposes
of each Agency, but if remittances for other objects are used in addi-
tion the consequences would soon become serious. I really (if the
re-imbursement of the appropriation for the school has not been made)
do not know what course to take. It would be extremely gratifying
to releive the case of its embarrassment, and I would cheerfully do it,
if I knew how. The same difficulty exists in regard to the remittance
for stock cattle.
The subject, in essence is this, (supposing your accounts to shew a
disbursement to the amount—of all the remittances—) There has
been used for the Indian Department, through you and for your
Agency, 7,000.3 more than was intended by the Department—The
remedy is, and this is the only one known to me, to withhold part of
the usual remittances for contingences until these sums are reimbursed,
when the money can be applied in the one case (the 6000$. for the
stock cattle) and reimbursed to the school appropriation in the other.
In pursuance of this plan 1000 dollars of the 1860 that would have
been remitted to you under the apportionment for the first half of this
year, for your contingences, is withheld, and will be paid towards the
apportionment for stock cattle to the person claiming it. This will
leave you 860 dollars for your contingences to include your pay for the
half year—which being, (including Office rent) 425. will leave for
contingences for the first half year 435 dollars.
If however you have reimbursed the 1000.3 as directed, this amount
1000$ will be remitted, on your giving this information.
I know no way to releive you from the dilemma in which you have
placed yourself in applying remittances for specific cases, to other
objects, and hope it may be agreeable to you.”

the Treasury of the decisions of Judge Woodward on points arising
under the Act granting preemptions in Florida and requesting that
appeals may be entered in all cases where the decision of the Judge
varies from our own views of the Law and the instructions we have
rec" from your Office, We regret to inform you that we are unable
to enter appeals in any of those Cases which have already been

require that the appeal should be entered in Open Court during the

having elapsed no appeal can now be entered
We take this occasion to remark that we have always been highly
dissatisfied with the decisions of Judge Woodward particularly in
those Cases where under his mandate, the Claimants were permitted
to enter lands in eighths of sections, and where the two persons lived
on the same quarter section they were permitted to enter two other
quarter sections in addition to the quarter on which they lived—The
Law confers this privilege in those cases alone where two persons live
on one fractional q' section, which is a technical term and not to be
applied to entire quarter sections containing their full complement of

appealed that the Council might have an Opportunity of prosecuting
the Appeal if it should so decide.

SIR, I am directed by the Secretary of War to enclose to you a copy
of a letter addressed by Col° Humphreys the Agent, to me,” and to
call your attention to the Act of the Legislature of Florida to prevent
Indians roaming at large &" " as referred to by—Col.” Humphreys.
I am directed to state that it is hoped under the present state of
excitement and the wretchedness of these people, that this act will not
be enforced. Exceptions may be very properly taken to it on other
grounds. It can hardly be conceived that the Indians would submit
to the chastisement contemplated by the act, without seeking to be
revenged. Out of this, feeble as they are, and for that very reason
appealing to the sympathies of the Government and people, not of
Florida only but, of the U. States—they might afflict the citizens of
the Territory, in the destruction of many lives, whilst the occasion
of their excitement and revenge might make it less a matter of con-
cern with every body. It will therefore be best to avoid on your part,
(by refraining to execute the provisions of the Act,) being the cause
of an excitement the issue of which cannot be foreseen.
It is hoped, however, apart from such conjectures as these, that the
present miserable and perishing condition of these people may induce,
in the citizens of Florida dispositions of forbearance and kindness,

the West of 2'. 27’’. in every five miles. The line soon entered a swamp
of such extent that although completely seperated from the great
Okfonooka by a narrow and low but dry isthmus covered with long
leaved pine and fan Palmetto it did not emerge under 15 miles.—In
a few chains under 30 miles the Suwany river was crossed without
making an offset, and there is now no ground to apprehend that such
an interruption in the work will take place on any part of the Line
except in the case of ponds too deep to pass but beyond which the
Signals can be distinctly seen.—The Line misses the Suwantichée,
but intersects the Aläpäháw and Withlacóoche branches of the Suwany
river—Of the chain of Lakes lying on this part of the Line all except
this, near which we now are, will be in Georgia, some of the others are
10 or 15 miles in circumference. This is a mile long and not much less
in width, with transparent waters and dry banks, in the midst of a fer-
tile country, with scenery truly picturesque and highly beautifull.
Of the climate I can say nothing more than that since the 25" day of
January, when I entered South Carolina, there has been an uninter-
rupted continuance of the finest Spring weather I ever witnessed in
my life, with no more rain than what has afforded a variation as agree-
able as necessary to vegetation I have not had the honour as yet to
receive any communications from your department since I left Rich-
mond, but trust that I may nevertheless, before I reach the Chata-
hooché, be gratified with the answer I have so long and so much
desired to my application from Albermarle early in December for a
copy of the report made by Ellicot and Minor in 1800.” As yet I can-
not myself say what resolution I shall take as to marking the line
permanently, if I remain unprovided with that important document,
which must have been lost in the endeavor to transmit it to me by
mail. I shall go to Talahassee from the nearest point of the line to
that place with the hope of finding the important communication
there—I have strong hopes that the line now runing will terminate
so near to the western extremity of the true boundary that the return
line will soon coincide with it; in which case we have no more to do
than to make a small mound at each of the mile stakes allready erected
and inscribed with the distance as the Line has advanced. The last
operation will be to continue the boundary eastward untill untill it
reaches the S" Marys river.—The two most important geographical
facts allready ascertained are, that the head Spring of the S* Marys
lies to the South of the point where the line will intersect that river,

name of the King's Road from the Georgia line, by St Augustine to

quarters, directs the Commanding General of the Western Dept., to

Execution of this work.” You are charged with the Superintendence

ss The pertinent portion of this order (no. 17) reads:
“4. The Commanding General of the Western Department will direct the
disposable force, at the most convenient Stations, to be employed in opening and
repairing the public road in the Territory of Florida known by the name of the
Kings Road, from the Georgia line, by St: Augustine, to New Smyrna; and, in
‘opening the Communication between Mochetto or Halifax, and Indian Rivers,
in the line of communication to Cape Florida, conformably to the Act of the 2nd
of March, 1827. The General Superintendence of this road, will devolve on the
Assistant Quarter Master who may be assigned to that duty.
“5. The Military Roads from Pensacola to St: Augustine, and from Colerain in
Georgia to Tampa Bay, whose completion is enjoined by the above named act of
March 2nd. 1827, have already been constructed and finished by the Army.”

issued by the Western Dept. on Apr. 22, 1827 (NA, WD, Hdqrs. West. Dept.,

of the operations connected with it, and will, when the means are
furnished you, commence the work and prosecute it with all practicable
economy and despatch—The track of the old road, it is presumed, is,
for the most part, sufficiently wide already—The law is silent on this
point—The road, should, however, be wide enough at all places, to
admit of the ordinary vehicles passing each other on the route—In
other respects, the face of the Country through which the road passes,
will indicate the kind of work and finish which should be bestowed
upon it, to render it durable and passable at all seasons; but you must
distinctly understand that the appropriation is not be exceeded.”
By the same act of Congress, the sum of Five thousand dollars is
appropriated for the Construction of a bridge across the St Sebastians
River, on the military road leading from Pensacola to St Augustine.
This object also, is confided to your superintendence, but it must be
executed by contract—with a view to economy you will invite pro-
posals for this work, having previously conferred with the Mayor of
St Augustine as to the particular description of bridge which is neces-
sary—But in the formation of a Contract you will bear in mind, that
the sum appropriated is under no circumstances to be exceeded.—Nor
will a contract be concluded until the right of way be secured—This
it is understood from Captain Burch, was denied to him, on a former
occasion, on both sides of the river—It must not be purchased now-
if it is not given by the holders or bought and transferred by the City
authority, the bridge cannot be commenced until you first report to

Some of the claims under the preemption law * have been im-

best to report the whole for the present, and inform you hereafter of
such as may be rejected. I have to renew my former request that no
patent may be issued to any of the claimants under that law for some
time.” The impositions which have been practiced under the law will
ultimately be detected, and we may have an opportunity of correcting
the evil.
In my last I mentioned that my deposites during the month of
February were near 70,000 dollars. This estimate was correct, but a

you to my letter to Gen Call on this subject.” Your letter with the
plat shall be forwarded to the Gen', and the existing state of things,
arising out of the decision of Judge Woodward, as I understand it,

As the private confirmed claims in West Florida, are not very
numerous, and lying principally around the Bay of Pensacola, I flatter
myself that you will be able to have them completed, and returned
early in the ensuing Winter.
It will not be advisable to enter upon the surveying of the private

will not be until next Winter.

LT F D. NEWCOMB A. A. Q Master Cantonment near Wantons
SIR, Your communication of the 1" Ulto," has been received, ac-
companied by your reports for the month of February.
Both the Secretary of War and the Q Master General are absent
from the City—But, as the opening of a road from your position to
the Ocklawaha, and the improvement of the navigation of that stream
from the point where the road shall strike it, to its junction with the
St John's river, appear to be objects of great importance with reference
to the transportation of the supplies for Maj Glassel's Command," I
feel it to be my duty, in the absence of higher authority, to authorize
the work. You will confer with Major Glassel on the subject, and
request of him a detail of the requisite force, to accomplish the con-
templated work at as early a period as practicable:—And as the
suggestion appears to have met his approbation, it is not doubted, that
he will render every facility in his power, consistent with a proper
regard to the other objects confided to him.
The troops who shall be engaged on this work, will be entitled to
the usual allowances in such cases.—
In answer to your enquiry in relation “to the materials that will
be allowed for quarters”, I can only remark, that, situated as you are,
it is impossible to send materials to you; and, that being supplied
with tools and nails, it is presumed, the mechanics of the command,
are competent to procure the necessary timber, and construct such
buildings as would answer the purpose at a temporary position.
Before you bestow any labor upon the Ocklawaha, it will be proper

to examine it carefully, from the point where the road is proposed to
intersect it, to its mouth, in order to ascertain whether it will, with
the improvements suggested, answer the object in view. The neces-
sity for this however, will depend upon the present state of your
information on the subject; but I would remark, that nothing short
of personal observation should be relied upon.
On the accomplishment of the work, a cargo of supplies will be
sent from some of the depots on the East side of the Peninsula, ac-
cording to the arrangements of the Subsistence Department.
Be pleased to report fully on this subject, in the course of your

TO THE REGISTER AND RECEIVER at Tallahassee
GENTLEMEN I now return seven Certificates for Preemption rights
which were issued under writs of Mandamus, if there are any others
similarly situated which have been forwarded by you to this office
you will be pleased to designate them, & they shall be returned—
Those now returned embrace two distinct questions arising under the
provisions of the act granting Preemption rights in Florida—The
first is whether the qr: Section granted under the 1* Section of the
act * shall be confined to sectional lines, and the second is whether
under the provisions of the 3" Section of the act, any person is en-
titled to more than the quantity of one quarter Section except in those
cases where two or more persons are settled on a fractional qr Sec-
tion.—On both these points it is believed that Judge Woodward has
given a decision not in conformity to the letter of the law, and the
issuing of the Patents for those Certificates is suspended for the
present *—Due respect however must be paid to the decisions of the
court, and as you have now lost the opportunity of appealing from
such decision in those particular cases, it is deemed proper to take
no other measures at present than that of merely suspending the
issuing of the Patent under an expectation that similar cases may
probably occur on which you will avail yourself of an appeal, the
issue of which appeal will decide the course which the Executive will
take in relation to the cases on which Patents are suspended.
The Certificates now returned will therefore remain with you untill
further instructed in relation to them. It will however be proper to
reserve from sale, the half quarter sections which the parties respec-
tively in your opinion would be entitled to, should the decision of
Judge Woodward be ultimately overruled—If no other cases should
occur, the probability is that, Patents will be issued on the Certificates
now returned.”

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 817
On the subject of the law passed by the late Legislative Council of
Florida to prevent the Indians roaming at large through the Territery
Country. This law has never been executed in any instance to my
knowledge, by any Citizen of this Territory. The parties of friendly
Indians who have been sent by the Chiefs into Our settlements to
bring home their wanderers have in a few instances flogged their own
people who have disobeyed their laws. The Chiefs have repeatedly
requested me, to have the wandering Indians who Came into Our
settlements without permission taken up and flogged—this was
never done, but the law is well Calculated to restrain the bad Indians
within their limits They are apprised of it, and so far, without
pressing its execution it has had the effect intended
I regret that the Agent without knowing the facts, (for he has but
recently returned to Florida) should have stated that the late murder
near Tallahassee was Occasioned by the head of the family having
whipped an Indian to death—The fact is M. Carr. whose family was
murdered had not been at home for many weeks before the murder
and was absent at the time and did return for several weeks after—
I never heard of this statement before and the Agent has taken it only
on idle rumour—If I am permitted to express my own Opinion as to
the exciting cause which produced the late murders in Georgia &
Florida—I would say it sprang from the belief On the part of the In-
dians that some persons in Georgia had stolen their horses—they
certainly lost some horses in the vicinity where they murdered the
two men in Georgia, And threatened to take satisfaction for their loss.
The Agent has suffered his feelings to mislead his judgment And
really has mistaken the facts.
I hesitate not to aver, that the Citizens of Florida have evinced
more good, humane, feeling, patience, and forbearing towards the
Indians under severe loss' And frequent insult, than I ever witnessed
in any frontier Country.
These people had been indulged so much that they became wanton
and insolent. Fed at every white mans house where they called,
they mistook humanity for fear, and for kindness and hospitality
paid them by robbing their houses And fields and killing their Cattle.
The great body of the nation have always behaved properly; but can
it be expected, when the Seminole nation is formed in part of the
outlaws of the Surrounding tribes, that such men can be governed in
any other manner than by force
I have never been considered as deficient in humanity—No man in
my situation ever took more pains or trouble than myself to protect
and Civilize these unfortunate people; but long experience has satisfied
me that too much kindness is as fatal to their happiness as too much
severity. There is no Consideration that could induce me to suffer

Indian Office TALLAHASSEE April 17* 1827.
Co! THOMAS L M*KENNEY Gen Super" of Indian Affairs
SIR I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the 20" of
March 1827 *—and in answer to the same I state that the remittence
made on the 28” of January 1825 of $1000 appropriated by Treaty
for the School for the Florida Indians never came to my hands; * but
was received by the late Actg Gov. Co' Walton, as it appears from the
Books in my Office, a Copy of his receipt to Thomas T Tucker Esq *
is herewith transmitted to you
The Six thousand dollars included in the remittence made to me on
the 17th day of August 1824 * for the purchase of Stock Cattle was
accounted for by me at the proper Department and the account
adjusted when I was in Washington in February 1825.
You are mistaken when you Suppose that either of the Sums
mentioned were used by me for the Agency—You will find that not
One dollar of either Sum was Appropriated by me for the Agency.
The $6000 was used in paying for the Indian Improvements, which
was fixed by the Treaty at $4.500. Eight hundred dollars more was
expended in the purchase of Stock Cattle for the Appalachicola Indians
And the balance went in the payment for rations.
The $4.500 intended to pay for the Indian Improvements had not
at that time been remitted And as it was highly important that the

Indians Should remove to the Country they were to inhabit in time
to raise a Crop for the year 1825, And as they Confidently expected
to be paid for their improvements before their departure from their
homes, the $6000 was Applied as I have stated—If it had not been so
applied at the time; the Indians would not have removed unless
Compelled by force—Maj Chaires was only entitled to $5,200 of the
$6000—for $800 as I have stated was paid by myself for the Stock
Cattle furnished to the Appalachicola Indians—If then, the late Actg
Governor Walton had paid Maj Chaires the $4.500 which he received
for Indian Improvements, And which had been Settled for by me;
but $700 would then have been due to Maj Chaires for the Cattle he
furnished for the Indians And which Sum Should have been taken
from the Appropriation for rations. I believe you will find from the
Account as Settled by me for the year 1824, at least that Sum was paid
for rations furnished by Capt M Crupper & Maj Chares over and
above the remittence actually made to me at that date for this specific
object.” I am entirely Sensible of the difficulties which must result
in closing the accounts with te the Department if the Sum allowed
for a Specific object, is exceded or improperly applied; but Surely the
Government would have Considered me as acting most Strangely, if
I delayed the Payment for the Indian improvements with Six thousand
dollars in my hands, when the Cattle too, were not delivered nor
ready for delivery, And when the delay might have Occasioned the
detention of the Indians in this quarter for Some time. I enclose to
you the several receipts of Co' Walton for money he received during
my absence from the Territory.
All the difficulty in the case is that I have Applied one specific
appropriation to Another object more pressing at the time, and
equally specific; but not as you Suppose for the use of the Agency,
but actually in Accordance with the Treaty—All which I Could
demonstrate to your Satisfaction if I could visit Washington City *
I am respectfully Your Obt Servt.

SIR, Yours of the 26th of March * is rec'd, and I enclose a Copy
of mine of the 8th March last,” lest the original may have miscarried
My wish is to get all the private claims in West Florida Surveyed and
returned in the course of this year & the ensuing winter. It would
not I think be expedient to commence the surveying of these private
claims, or to extend the Surveying of the Public Lands in East Florida
until the final confirmation by Congress of the reports of the Comm”
which will I presume be had at the next Session.—
You will please put the Reg' at St Augustine in immediate posses-
sion of the Township plats of those Lands which have been sectioned
off in that Land Dist. It is possible, though I think not probable,
that there are some persons settled within the limits of those surveys,
who may be entitled to preemptions & who wish to enter them.
Should the surveying of the Private claims in West Florida exceed
$10.000. the excess must be paid from the appropriation of 1828.”

HON JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War
SIR I have the honor to inform you that all the Indians with the
exception of one called Billy who resides in the Creek nation, that are
alive and concerned in the late murders committed in Georgia and
Florida, are prisoners.” They were taken by a detachment from the
command of Capt F L Dade and a party of warriors Sent by the Agent
Col Humphreys under the command of Neamathla a chief who was
on a visit to you last Spring, with the other Chiefs from Florida–
Three other Chiefs, and ten warriors assisted Neamathla; their con-
duct deserves praise and reward. These chiefs have requested me to
represent the Services of themselves and warriors to the President of
the United States—They Say that for the last three months they have
been actively engaged in Seeking the offenders, that they have Suffered
many privations and encountered great fatigue in apprehending the
murderers. And pray that compensation may be made to them; The
three chiefs deserve notice and it Submitted to your judgement if
it would be proper to Send Elukee, Mathla Tuchab chee Harjo and
the Yellow Snake each a medle—I hope that you will consent to com-
pensate these Chiefs and their followers.
The prisoners were found on an Island near the Sea cost where
they had planted corn and perhaps never would have been taken but
for the Skill and management of the Indians who trailed them to their
hiding place—They Surrounded the prisoners and took them by
Surprise no resistance was made—but the chiefs were Solicitous to
put them to death according to their own laws—this I had expected

appropriation out of which to pay it.-Governor Duval, it appears,
applied this remittance to the purposes of his Agency, in the press of
demands upon him, at that time:—He made it a part of his Contin-
gencies. The only remedy in the power of the Department, the
specific appropriation being closed, by the remittance made to Gov-
ernor Duval as Stated, is to retrench the allotment for his Contin-
gencies in such sums as may be possible, so as not to embarrass the
Indian Department in Florida, overmuch—and thus repay, to the
object of the Specific appropriation, the amount diverted from it by
Governor Duval. I told you I should recommend this course to the
Secretary of War. He approved it as being the best that could be
done, but feeling at the same time the direct obligation to pay you at
once, were there means to do so, at his disposal.
In pursuance of this plan, there has been deducted One Thousand
Dollars, from the allotment for Governor Duval's agency for this

SIR. My letter to you of the 13" inst " was not designed to in-
sinuate a Suspicion of your having improperly sought to ascertain
the contents of letters, for no Such Suspicion existed. You had very
properly communicated what appeared to you a violation of the frank-
ing privilege; and my answer was designed to advise you of the proba-
bility of a mistake on that point, since it is not certain that the en-
closure may not relate to the business of the person who gives the
frank.—
In stating that this cannot be known without violating the Sanctity
of a letter, there is no implication intended, but it is simply to Shew
that a person may be under a mistake when it would appear to him
that the law was violated. I am not certain that officers of the Treas-
ury Department have not violated this privilege; but from the diffi-
culty which exists of obtaining full proof, of the fact, and from the
responsibility of their Station, it seems more Safe to presume that
they are not in the habit of transcending the bounds of the law."

SIR, Your communication addressed to the Secretary of War on

now engaged in running out the private claims on the Bay of Pensa-
cola, it is desirable that they should be furnished with Copies of the
surveys of the lands reserved for military purposes on that Bay or the
Island adjacent thereto, has been received and referred to this De-
partment.
A part only of the system for fortifying the Bay of Pensacola has
been projected by the Board of Engineers; and until the whole system
be completed the Department will not be able to determine and desig-
nate the extent and positions of lands which may be required as sites
for fortifications for the defence of that Bay: nor is the Department
aware that any reservations for military purposes have as yet been
made in the Territory of the Floridas
The Board of Engineers are now on their way to East and West
Florida in the execution of instructions from this Department: and
when in the latter territory will be directed to ascertain and report
the situation and extent of such sites as may be necessary for the
works destined for the protection of the Bay and Harbour of Pensa-
cola, according to the plans they may devise for that important object.
As soon as their report is received the result will be communicated
to you.”

what was to be done. I suggested the propriety of spedily taking
position at or near the ferry on the Suwannee. He agreed with me
but believed that my stay there would be short as both himself and
Col. Clinch had recommended a removal of the Compy. to the Agency
or its Vicinity. I returned to St Mark on the 17" Nov" and on the
18" took up the line of march. On the 24" I reached the Suwannee,
and selected such a position on its Eastern bank as in my Judgment
was the most eligible in obedience to Order N° 61. of the 22" Inst."
The position was not designated by the Govenor of Florida. That
it was the most eligible one, that could be selected on that Stivañña
river and was not only calculated, but did go far “to repress Indian

following facts connected with it—M" Cook assignee of M. Floyd
carried the mail in a very unsatisfactory manner, and I found it
necessary to prepare for making a change, or substituting another

agreement or not, as appeared proper, and on the reception of his
communication on the Subject, I decided to let the contract of Mr
Cook remain, and not to employ you as his Successor. He has con-
sequently been paid for the Service claimed to be performed by you.
I have however with a disposition to do justice between you and the
public directed an enquiry to be made, to ascertain the ground of
your claim, and the extent of Service you have performed, and ex-
penses incurred. As soon as I obtain the information I will inform
you of my decision.—

We propose to leave this place tomorrow to reconnoitre the country
between the heads of S" John's river and Tampa Bay in order to test
the comparative advantages of a route in this direction with the
routes pointed out in our former instructions.

MILLEDGEVILLE May 15, 1827.
SIR, I have had the honour to transmit to you by mail three several
packets containing the communications made by the Governor of
Georgia to the Comm” of that State while we were upon the line, and
a correspondence between the two Comm” which took place upon
the suggestion of M* Spalding who declared that he deemed that
formality necessary.” In consequence of the last communication
from Governour Troup all further proceedings stoped on the 26"
April; the Comm” of the United States being entirely unprovided
with means to continue them, or any accrediting testimonial which
might have supplied the place; which he regrets the more, from the
conviction he is under that the result would have been accepted by
the Legislature of Georgia and a final Boundary established without
that additional expence which has been by the interference rendered
unavoidable. The expenditure made on this occasion has proved
much greater than any one expected, but it is manifest that the
U.S. Comm” could have no control over it, and that he could not
do otherwise than submit to the judgement of the Com" of Georgia
upon every question of that nature, for the alternative was allways
to require the Com" of Georgia to submit to him, who was much less
qualified to judge of such things in Georgia. Much might have been
saved by bringing out one half at least of the party from Virginia,
as was proposed. In that case the work would have been completed,
and a new investigation for the head of the S" Marys made, which
the two comm” had indeed agreed to make when they arrived at the
Eastern end of the line; that of the U.S. having proposed to take the
responsibility upon himself of concurring, from the entire conviction
that the result would thoroughly support the view taken by Congress.
By crossing the S" Marys at Ellicots mound above and below on
horseback repeatedly, while Mr. Spalding had crossed it only once
upon a log, I had satisfied myself of the accuracy of Ellicott and
Minor. Immediately above the mound B. the river could not be
navigated in a canoe, for it is a narrow rivulet in the middle of a wide

bog, while immediately below, all in sight of B, if the ground was
cleared of trees & shrubs, it is a river boatable for 15 tons. above it
came to my horses knees: below, half way up the saddle skirts, at the
same time. It is true that following the course of the greatest length
of one of the swamps which supply the river you will go southwardly
a little, and that swamp after rains has a perceptible motion in its
Waters, but another swamp trends West, and is much more extensive,
with much the greater part of its extent on the North of our line.
The question made by Georgia now is too trifling in my opinion to
have produced those consequences which the ferment excited about
Milledgeville, I conclude, has rendered expedient. A letter from a
Secretary of War in 1819 authorized Georgia to expect a new investi-
gation to determine the exact locality of the head of S' Marys.” The
expression used is “the acquisition of the Floridas may change the
character of the Boundary” But that investigation was really made
by Georgia in 1819, and the report concludes in these words, “we are
therefore of opinion that Mr. Ellicott and the Spanish deputation
were correct in establishing on the Northern branch the point of
demarcation between the State of Georgia and the province of East
Florida” The question now made did not occur to the three Comm”
of 1819, all appointed by Georgia. This correspondence will be found
in the Department of War, and the report as communicated by
Governor Rabun." It is proposed here to send a Georgia Surveyor
to search for the head of the River." I cannot omit to declare my
* The Secretary of War to Gov. William Rabun, Mar. 2, 1819 (NA, WD, SW
Lets. Sent, Bk. 10).
80 A letter from Rabun to the Secretary of War, Mar. 3, 1819, states that
after a careful examination the commissioners had found the head of the St.
Marys River to agree with the report by Ellicott (NA, WD, SW Lets. Recd.,
R 124).
90 John McBride, whose report on the survey of the boundary between Georgia
and Florida, May 17, 1827, is in NA (OIA, Lets. Recd., Ga.), and a copy in
NA (HF, 20 Cong., 1 sess.), made a report to Gov. Troup, Aug. 7, 1827, relative
to the source of the St. Marys River (copy in NA, HF, Orig. Mess. Pres., 20 Cong.,
1 sess.; printed in S. Doc. 55, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 6-11; H. Doc. 87, 20 Cong.,

22 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 48–52; S. Misc. Doc. 25, 33 Cong., 2 sess., pp. 238–243).
This report was transmitted to the President by Gov. John Forsyth, of Georgia,
Nov. 20, 1827, as evidence that “the source of the St. Mary's is the lake or spring
from which issues the most southern branch of that river, and therefore the spot
at which must terminate the straight line to be drawn from the junction of the
Flint and Chattahoochee rivers” (copy in NA, HF, Orig. Mess. Pres., 20 Cong.,
1 sess.; printed, S. Doc. 55, 20 Cong., 1 sess., p. 6; H. Docs. 43 (pp. 47–48) and

of Georgia preposterous (Memoirs J. Q. Adams, Nov. 30, 1827, VII, 364-365.
See also ibid., pp. 371-372, 378-379,385–386, 409, 428,429).

sentiments in regard to this proposal, that they may not be unknown
when that case comes up hereafter. Whoever he may be, he will not
venture to give an opinion adverse to the public wishes, if the excite-
ment in the public mind should be considerable at the time upon the
question, which is not the case now generally, I am very sure, for
many more persons have expressed their regret at the interruption
than the contrary. Yet, no doubt, by taking a dry time a survey
may be made of the rivulet runing into S' Mary's near the mound
and the point determined geographically where it ceases to be a
rivulet and becomes a bog, supposing the astronomical results of
Ellicott by which the Geographical position of the mound has been
determined to be correct. and their verification by a practical astron-
omer furnished with perfect instruments and allowed several weeks
at each extremity of the line ought not to be omitted on such an
occasion. With respect to the Western extremity enquiry should
then be made whether a point in the bed of the river, rarely ever
uncovered there, has not been taken for the junction, one mile or more
south of the cape or head land forming the point of the fork, where
the banks of the two rivers unite, and their waters join, except in
very uncommon dry seasons. Cypress and other aquatic trees grow
all over the bed of the rivers to the south, and their streams are seen
meandering through them. That is the case with Suwany, where it
is very rapid. I must be permitted to declare my opinion that if
Georgia and the United States were to leave the geometrical operations
precisely as they now stand, it would give general satisfaction here-
after. If the line run Westward on this occasion as far as the
Wythlacóochè 68 miles, and the line run Eastward to the same,
93 miles, with the short course of river between were adopted as the
permanent boundary, there could not be any dissatisfaction on
either side, now or hereafter; and no further expence would be requisite.
One straight line will intersect the Wythlacooche more than once, and
will leave small portions of Florida on its North, and like fragments
of Georgia on the South, forming fractional parts upon a general survey
of no value whatever. These two lines are sufficiently marked as
they are now; the first here mentioned by mile stakes numbered, and
the second by five mile hillocks, made with a hoe, and both, well, by
blazing trees on both sides.
When the party broke up, the majority proceeded to Darien with
the provisions which remained, while the Commissioner and secretary
with the surveyor chain carriers and signal bearers, set out directly by
the head of the Allapaha a branch of Suwany river, and the south bend
of Altamaha for Milledgeville. I accompanied those of course, with
the view first to close the commission and get copies of all documents,
and next to obey the order of the Department issued from the office of

Indian affairs under dates of December and February last in regard
to the claims of Baley and Brodnax" for supplies furnished to the
friendly Creek Indians who had been expelled from their country
when McIntosh” was assassinated. When we arrived at the Alta-
maha, the waters of Oakmulghee were so high that it could not be
crossed, and we had to make our way, after separating from the
Surveyor and his men, along its banks for 50 miles up to the ferry at
Hartford, before we arrived at which we had numerous creeks to pass
by wading up to the shoulders, on account of the unsoundness of their
bottoms, and were thereby delayed untill the night of the 6". On the
morning of the 10" the comm” separated. I have a copy of the
account of expenditure but I have as yet received nothing from the
Surveyor, for whose residence in Putnam County I shall set out
tomorrow, being sure of concluding today the business devolved on
me from the office of Indian affairs. Here I may be allowed to inform
you that the Creek Indians of the party friendly to the United States
are at this time allmost starving, the only subsistence of men women
and children being the root of a kind of Bamboo called here China
briar, the Smilax Pseudo-China of the Botanists, which is rendered
esculent only by a tedious preparation and has not—nutritive virtue
enough to save the lives of their children, all of whom will probably
perish without immediate relief from the United States, as most of
those of the Seminoles in the Peninsula of Florida have allredy done
from want of wholesome food. No other aid from the United States
than the issue of one peck of Corn a head per week would be necessary
or expedient. Brigadier General Ware" of the Georgia Militia would
be the best person to address to on this occasion if it should be resolved
to do any thing in this case of the utmost possible wretchedness into
which their civil broils have brought the part of the Nation allways
faithfull to the United States. I have no doubt that the whole Creek
Nation could be easily prevailed upon now to consent to move over
the Mississippi, and the Seminoles will gladly share their destinies
at this time. But a special mission from the President, best perhaps
composed of the Military of some rank, will be necessary on the
occasion in my opinion. Nothing is likely to be done unless the
authority be so new and of such dignity as to render useless or vain
and unavailing in result all factious contrivances to thwart the views
of Government from illwill to the Agents employed by it. These
savages are as credulous & indicisive as they are ignorant & capricious.

With them idle tales or malicious representations & statements have
as much effect as accurate information. Every thing which fosters
and strengthens their natural suspicion and jealousy is well received
by them. Whatever is done with them must be quick done by a
commanding influence. I trust what I have here said needs no
apology as my attention has been turned to this subject by duties
which have been assigned to me from a branch of your Department.
I have allready forwarded my report in the case of Baley and shall
send that in the case of Brodnax by tomorrows mail. The decisions
I have made in these cases have been founded upon evidence which
would have satisfied my mind as a juror in making up my opinion for a

the persons to whom I have had access, and who were in the way to

have been duly considered by me, notwithstanding their want of
weight from want of character.
I am authorized to say in regard to the question with Georgia about

made under the auspices of both the Federal Government and the State of Georgia
during the territorial period of Florida. Inasmuch as the survey of 1827 ac-
complished nothing definite, the Surveyor General of the Territory of Florida
was obliged to continue operating without a better northern boundary than
that of the survey of McNeil of 1825. A line was finally run in 1857 by B. F.
Whitner, Jr., and J. J. Orr between the mouth of the Flint River and the Ellicott
mound on the St. Marys River. This line was accepted by Florida in 1861 and
by Georgia in 1866, and it was confirmed by an act of Congress approved Apr. 9,
1872, which settled and quieted the land titles south thereof (16 STAT. 52; Frederick

distress for want of food had fallen upon the Creek Indians of Mc-
Intoshes party, as very unfortunate, and I feel very sure the Colonel
has had some bad, if not insidious advice given him on that subject.
They would not only enter their names now but would actually follow
him like hungry dogs to be fed, any where he might lead. My in-
formation is derived from many persons whom I have met at different
times, some every day for a few days back, immediately from among
them. The wretchedness of the Florida Indians was communicated

been previously received and acknowledged—The Register at S*Au-

mail the plats and field notes of those Surveys addressed to “the
Register of the Eastern Land District” unless an opportunity by
private Conveyance shall occur in the mean time-I have received
on the 7th inst, “the acts passed at the Second Session of the nineteen
Congress” and by last mail a book of State papers relating to the pri-
vate land Claims in Florida, which will enable me to Commence at an
early day the Contemplated Surveys; and I trust shall be enabled to
report them in Sufficient time to meet your wishes.
The Receiver having informed me that he was instructed to reserve
from Sale Neamathla's reservation on Rocky Comfort,” I have dis-

that reservation, and Calculate the adjoining fractions that they may
be Sold. The reservation has been long abandoned and Neamathla

SIR We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 13" ult * in which you request further information on the Sub-
ject of the reservations made adjacent to the Town of Tallahassee by
the Lieut Governor and by the Register and Receiver.
The enclosed diagram we hope will furnish the information required.
The reservations made originally by the Lieut Governor, consisted of
the South East qr and the North West and [Nort]h East q" of Section
36 Township one Range [on]e North and West and the South West [q]r
of Section 31. Township one Range one North and East, when the
last named Township was selected by the Agent] of Gen' Layfayette
it was deemed expedient by the Lieut Governor to Select another qr
Section in lieu of the one he had previously taken in that Township,
and in conjunction with the Register & Receiver he Selected the five
qauarter Sections designated as reserves South of the Bases Parallel.
as this reservation was made jointly by the Leiut Governor and the
Register and Receiver at the same time it is impossible to say which
particular quarter Section was reserved by the Lieut Governor. The
North West qr of Section 6 within th[is] reserve has Since been entered
by Gov" Duval under the preemption law. The checkered qr Section
designates the Town of Tallahassee. The q(r] marked C was purchased

CAMP KING (Florida) May 16" 1827–
SIR, In answer to a communication received from Maj. T. Cross,
Act” for the Quarter Master Genl., authorising “the improvement
of the navigation of the Oklawaha” &c, I have the honor to tender
the following report.—
One of the principle tributaries of the Oklawaha, has its origin
three miles from Camp King, in what is called the “Big-Spring”,”
which is from 6 to 7 fathoms in depth, and from 30 to 40 yards in
width;—it forms a convenient place, for landing the supplies intended
for this post.—A road is already opened to the spot intended for a
landing, and the opening of this branch to its confluence with the
Oklawaha, and the latter stream, from thence to its union with
the St. Johns; will be commenced by the 24" of the present month,
and compleeted, probably, by the middle of June; so as to be navigable
for large boats & barges.—Three boats have been built, or are now
finishing, suitable for the work which with one of a smaller class,
that I shall hire, and the Tools I have provided, will comprise every
facility for succesful operation.—
* Answered post, p. 884. See post, pp. 855, 955.
* Ante, p. 811.
* This allusion is to the spring which became famous in later years as “Silver
Springs,” the development of which as a major tourist attraction began towards
the end of the century. Regarded as the largest spring in Florida, it gushes
from the limestone rock, giving rise to the Silver River flowing eastward into
the Oklawaha River. The spring appears as “Silver Spring” on John Lee Williams'
Map of Florida (New York, 1837).

The articles which will be most wanted at this post, and which
will be absolutely necessary, to render the Quarters comfortable in
Winter, will be window-glass. Bricks & Lime:—We will want also,
plank for flooring &c, as we cannot saw by hand, all that will be re-
quired;—together with nails, Iron and Steel.—Maj. Glassell re-
quested me to mention the above named articles, as those that would
be indispensably necessary—
The Character of the “Big Spring” branch or river, being somewhat
singular, I hope the General will excuse me, for giving a slight sketch
of it;—It seems a river issuing from the bowels of the Earth, and with
the exception of the part I have before mentioned, it is subterraneous
altogether.-The principle characteristics, of the small streams in this
country, are, that they sink into the earth and appear again at inter-
vals, that do not exceed two miles, and that their courses can be
traced by the growth above them; but of this, no part is known save
this branch, which appears to be the trunk of a large river, and its
course cannot be determined, by any variation in the growth of
timber.—The water is so pure & clean, that when the surface is
unruffled, at the depth of 37 feet the most minute object may be
discovered, even to the smallness of a pin, with as much ease, as
through a glass medium of ordinary thickness.—
The current of this Stream, from its head 'till it joins the Oklawaha
is from 1 to 2 miles an hour—the distance 15 miles *—

The tables of contents will exhibit the private claims and the Public
Lands separately—that for the public lands will in all cases be added
up and exhibit the total quantity. As the private Claims will some-
times cross the Township lines, the totals in that table cannot be
always accurately stated. The subdivisions of the sections made
fractional by the private claims should be exhibited on the Township
plats in the same manner as those made fractional by other causes.—
It is altogether at the request of the War Department that the
Indian claims are reserved from sale.
I will thank you to state as nearly as practicable what amount of
money will be required by you to pay for surveying to be executed in
1827. I should think that you have Township lines enough already
run out. It must necessarily be late in the Spring of 1828, before you
can commence the surveys of the private Claims in East Florida, but
when you do commence you should be prepared to proceed rapidly
with them, in the mean time such Townships in West Florida as
contain private Claims and those not heretofore sectioned, so far as
they embrace lands of good quality and desirable to be brought into

MAJ GEN ALEx MACOMB Chief Engineer
SIR. My last communication (dated Tampa Bay Brook's Cantone-
ment May 23°)" informed you that Capt" Poussin and myself were
about to embark on the Revenue Cutter, Alabama, Cap" W Foster,
to proceed to the examination of the coast extending from Tampa
Bay to Pensacola. We left the former place on the 24" of May &
reached the latter this day.
Among the objects examined, S" Joseph's Bay has received the
attention to which it is entitled. The channel into this Bay lies and
runs round the northern end of the Peninsula forming the Bay. Its
width, on the bar, varies from 150 to 200 yards. The bar is from
500 to 600 yards in width measured in the direction of the channel
and lies about 3% a mile from the inner point of the Peninsula: the
depth of water over it was at full tide, 19% feet; at low tide may be
reckoned at 17 feet.
During the examination of this coast, we have derived from Capt."
W. Foster, not only the most effectual cooperation but also the most
valuable information. And, in order to ensure more fully the ac-
complishment of this examination, Capt Foster, before leaving Pensa-
cola, had procured the most experienced pilot on this coast.

DEAR SIR, I enclose a letter from Gen LaFayette; * if you will
transmit your answer, to me it shall be forwarded to him.
17 On June 18, 1827, Gen. Bernard reported his arrival at New Orleans after
examining the country between the Bays of Pensacola and Mobile and various
forts (NA, WD, CE Bö. Engrs. Int. Improvts., Lets. Sent). After his return to
Washington, Bernard called upon the President and stated that a ship canal
across the isthmus of Florida was impracticable and that the most that could be
effected was a canal six feet deep for steamboats, and that a canal between Mobile
and Pensacola Bays was practicable (Memoirs of J. Q. Adams, VII, 353). Major
Perrault also returned to Washington to work on a report and maps. Numerous
maps of the bays, sounds, and rivers of Florida based on the surveys of 1826–1827
were prepared and are preserved in NA (CR, CE); most of these were published
as insets on the map facing p. 854. The report was submitted to the Chief Engineer
by Gen. Bernard, Feb. 19, 1829, and was printed, without the map which was
published separately, in S. Doc. 102, 20 Cong., 2 sess. and in H. Doc. 147, 20
Cong., 2 sess. Major Perrault had submitted on Feb. 1, 1828, a report entitled
“A Report on an intended communication bet. the Atlantic and the Gulf of
Mexico by cutting a canal through the Peninsula of Florida,” together with the
following additional reports: Nov. 9, 1827, by Lt. Huger on the line from St.
Marys to the Suwannee and from St. Marys to Black Creek, May 27, 1827, by
Lt. Brisbane, reconnaissance of the St. Johns River, Oct. 20, 1826, by Lt. Canfield,
the Suwannee, St. Marks, and Santa Rosa Sound. These were transmitted to
Gen. Bernard by the Chief Engineer on Feb. 8, 1828, for the use of the board in
preparing its report.
See the Chief Engineer (or his office) to the Secretary of War, Feb. 12, Feb. 15,
Mar. 15, May 3, and May 31, 1827 (NA, WD, CE Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 4),
requesting, on the respective dates, that the following sums be sent to Perrault
for the canal survey: $600, $1000, $200, $1576, and $867. See also id. to
DeRussey, June 16, 1827 (NA, WD, CE Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 3),
directing him to pay an account in the sum of $893.50 for the hire of the Sloop
Ann Maria for the survey in Florida under Perrault up to Feb. 12, 1827, the
amount to be charged to the Florida canal survey; Capt. Winslow Foster to
Bernard, Apr. 25, 1827 (NA, WD, CE Bd. Engrs., Inter. Improvts., Lets. Recd.),
advising of his arrival at St. Marks, there to receive on board a party to examine
the Gulf Coast.

but if he desired it, the sale might take place in December next, when
you will perceive there will be a public sale at Tallahassee. Will
you be so good, as to give me your opinion, how far such a sale under all

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a Copy of a
letter addressed by you to Major Gen Gaines, dated on the 15*
Ulto:* and in reply thereto, have to State that having been charged
by the General in Chief, with the defence of the frontiers of Georgia
and Florida, and having been vested by the same authority with full
powers to dispose of the Troops Stationed in Florida, in any way
that I should think best Calculated to effect this object—I did so,
and reported to him, through your Office, as will appear from my letter
dated on the 13" February, 1827,” a Copy of which is herewith
enclosed—From this letter you will also learn that the Company
Commanded by Captain Dade, and Originally Stationed on the Su-
wannee River was drawn back and established on the Oscilla River
and much Credit is due to Cap' Dade and his Command, in Con-
junction, with a party of Indians, sent to his aid by Cap" Glassell,
for their zeal and Activity in Scouring the Country, lying between
the Suwannee and Oscilla Rivers, and taking from their lurking
places, fifteen or twenty Indians, supposed to have been Connected
with the murderers of Carrs family—which prompt and energetic
measures, have in a great measure, quieted the fears & apprehensions

of most of the inhabitants in that Section of Country—Cap' Dade
was instructed to take a healthy position near the Oscilla River, and
to make his Command Comfortable by erecting temporary Huts—
and it was not my intention that the Company should have Occupied
that position for a longer period of time, than the fall—by which time,
I believed that, that Section of Country, would have gained sufficient
Strength, from the great number of families removing to it, to take
Care of itself—It appears however from your letter to Major General
Gaines, that the Hono: Secretary of War, has on information no doubt
much more Correct than any I have been able to obtain, formed an
Opinion on this Subject, different from the one entertained by the
Officer who has the immediate Command in this Section of Country—
and in Carrying the Order for the removal of the Company from the
Oscilla into effect, the responsibility is of Course removed from that
Officer to the Authority from whence it eminated—I was under the
impression that my letter to the General in Chief, as before alluded to,
Contained Sufficient information as to the distribution and location
of the Troops in Florida—but on referring to that letter, I find that
I should have been more explicit as to the location of the new tempo-
rary Military post, directed to be established pursuant to Order 79,
of 1826*—and I now have the honor to report that in Conformity
to that Order, I Caused the post on the Suwannee river, to be aban-
doned, and a Site Selected near the Florida Agency for the new post,
which post is now Garrisoned by two Companies of the 4* Infantry
Commanded by Captain Glassell and to which he has given the name
of Cant. King—From my knowledge of the Indian Character, I
Consider this post of more importance, in Controuling the Indians,
and in giving protection and Security to the inhabitants of Florida,
than any other post in the Territory, as it is in the immediate vicinity
of the largest number of the Florida Indians, and between them and
the white inhabitants—& I am also of the Opinion, that it is of the
first importance that it Should be garrisoned by two Companies
for altho' much Credit is due to Major Pierce and Cap" Glassell and
their Commands, for their zeal and Activity in Carrying into Effect
the instruction given them, relative to the Indians, Still in a Country
like the One assigned to their protection, but little can be effected
with one Company—with a knowledge of these facts, & a full view
of all the Circumstances Connected with this Subject—I have Con-
sidered it my duty to Suspend the removal of One of the Companies,
from the post near the Florida Agency until I receive further Orders
on that Subject—and at the same time, beg leave to recommend in the
Strongest terms, that the two Companies be continued at that post,

of troops from the post near the Aucilla (Oscilla). See Gadsden to the Secretary
of War, July 8, 1827 (NA,OIA, Reg. Lets. Recd., No. 2), expressing the hope
that the order for removing the troops from the post near the Aucilla and Pensacola
may be reconsidered for the security of the inhabitants. This letter was answered
July 17, 1827 (NA,WD,SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 12), to the effect that the com-
manding officer at Pensacola had discretionary powers for continuing the troops
in Florida and that the company near the Aucilla would not be removed until

JOSHUA A. COFFEE TO THOMAS L. MCKENNEY
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.:LS]
S* AUGUSTINE June 13th 1827.—
SIR, I now forward you my Report as promised in my letter of the
14" ultimo,” as full & explanatory as I can possibly make it—No
private claims, or white settlements have been interfered with, except
Big Swamp:—it was necessary to embrace all that tract to give the
indians a sufficient quantity of good land to cultivate, and their
attachment for that Swamp is inconceivable. Big Swamp contains,
about Eight thousand acres of the first quality hammock lands,
Five thousand of second quality hammock lands, & three thousand
of Oak & Hickory lands of the second quality.—You will perceive
by my Report that I have described the country on the East of the
Ockelewaha River:—no white person would think of residing on that
River with but One or two exceptions, even in the event of a removal
of the Indians, and those exceptions would only be suitable situations
for stock or cattle owners as there is but little good hammock land
attached to any of those situations, say from fifty to One hundred
aCreS.
The amount due me by the Government I hope you will transmit
to me as early as possible—Lieu' D'espenville will forward his acc"
from Savannah or Charleston; the amount due him will be deducted
from the Acc" curr” forwarded to you on the 15* May last.*
One hundred Dollars was paid to two Indians for finding Lieu"
D'espenville whilst lost, when on that duty. He was lost four days;
the fifth day at about 2 o’Clock P. M. he was found by two indians—
Every exertion by myself and party had been used without success
until I employed indians, and no reward less than the amount above
stated would induce them to assist me in the search; I commenced
at Ten Dollars and continued to increase as the case became more
desperate until One hundred dollars were offered, when about ninety
of the Warriors turned out, & the second day two of them came up
with him, consequently they were entitled to the reward. I have
given Lieu' D'espenville my Certificate of the payment of that am",
but have not charged it in my acc" with the United States. I con-
fidently rely on this am" being paid when said certificate is forwarded
to your Department.”

vising that he had arrived at St. Augustine a few days before, having completed

S* AUGUSTINE June 1* 1827.
SIR, I herewith transmit to you a plat of the Indian Boundary as
extended, together with field notes of the same, * agreeably to your
instructions, and a copy of my instructions from His Excellency
Governor Duval.”
In running the line I have not interfered either with white Settle-
ments, or individual Claims, except in Big Swamp;—it was necessary
to embrace the whole of it, to give the indians a sufficiency of good
land for their support.—There is no good land embraced in the line
north of Big Swamp, except small detached hammocks.—Wetuxy,
about eight miles north of the Agency, contains only, about one thou-
sand acres of good land:—The Cowpen Swamp has also some small
hammocks of from fifty to one hundred acres.—You will perceive by
the plat that the line was continued across the Ocklewaha River, and
passes a little south of the middle grounds, between the Rivers S*
Johns & Ockelewaha:—this line I think was all important to exclude
them from the River St Johns & the white settlements on the Tomoca.
and Mosquittoe Rivers, and to remove those indian settlements on
the west banks of S" Johns River, they not having recognized the
Ockelewaha their boundary as specified by the treaty. The Country
embraced by that line is only adapted for them:—there is no good
land, except very small detached hammocks on the margins of the
Swamp of the Ockelewaha River, and a small portion of pine land,
that many of them cultivate, with but little success; the remainder
consists in ponds and scrub of the most inferior quality. By the plat
you will observe many indian settlements, some of which are from
twenty five to thirty years standing, the breaking up of which, would
have created much confusion & distress among those unfortunate
people, whilst the Country they occupy is not worth any thing to the
Government, at the Same time they appear perfectly Satisfied with
their Situation—

Big Hammock runs nearly parallel with the Gulf of Mexico for
many miles, which you will observe by the plat, but contains but
little good land, & that, at the north west end:—This Hammock is
principally occupied by the indians formerly called the Red Sticks;
they removed from the State of Alabama during the late war and are
an industrious friendly people—
The north line is about three miles south of Wetomkee:—the
indians are generally satisfied with their new limits, and have a suffi-
ciency of good land.—Line N° 1. running West passes through low
flat pine land, and numerous cypress swamps & ponds:—the land is
extremely poor.—Line N° 2, running North passes through the same
description of Country. Line N° 3 running North 22° West passes
thro’ cypress swamps & ponds for some miles in extent, after which
the Sand hills commence & continue the balance of the line. —Line
N° 4. running North 15° East, passes thro' high sand hills the whole
distance, the growth of which is dwarf pine, black jack, & saw pal-
metto, and the country very poor. Line N° 5. running North, passes
over the same description of sand hills for some miles & then crosses
the Amaxura River, after which the country becomes low & swampy,
for some miles, and then the Sand hills commence & continue to the
North west corner, with the exception of one pond called Stony Pond,
one mile across—The north line running North 80° East passes
thro’ high lands for the first Sixteen miles:—a small part of this dis-
tance you will observe that the line runs thro' small skirts of hammock,
& a portion of mixed land of no value:—the balance of this line runs
thro' low pine land, interspersed with cypress swamps ponds, branches
&"—The Ockelewaha River has on both margins, with but few ex-
ceptions, extensive Cypress swamps, from a half to two miles wide;—
the parts of the river where those swamps do not exist, runs thro'
extensive saw grass marshes, from one to three miles wide, which
makes it impossible to approach this River, except at places where
the indian trails cross it. After crossing the river & its swamps, a
bay gall occurs, which is one mile thro’; then commences the Scrub
of the most steril kind and continues the balance of lines N* 1, 2, 3,
& a part of N° 4 which the plat will show. From this point the
country commences with undulating pine land, free from all small
growth, except saw palmetto, interspersed with clear water ponds,
and the land unfit for cultivation. The balance of line N° 4 passes
thro’ Creeks, swamps, and low flat saw palmetto land of no value.
Line N° 5 runs thro' Cabbage palmetto swamps & Creeks, also low
flat pine land with saw palmetto, until it unites with the Cypress
swamp South of the head of S" Johns River.

The party was then compelled to retrace the line to the trail, which
conveyed us to Tampa Bay, crossing the heads of the Amaxura &
Hillsboro Rivers. Those rivers where crossed by the party, are
nothing more than flat cypress ponds with small running streams:—
You will also observe by the plat, that between the heads of those
rivers & lake Ahapopka, that there is a chain of sand hills for some
miles of considerable heighth, say from forty to Sixty feet above the
ordinary level of the Country. I was informed by the indians that
those sand hills continued South some miles—I have to report the
unavoidable loss of two horses, one of which I was compelled to re-
place by the purchase of another, but some hopes yet remain that
one of them will be recovered; if so, it shall be immediately reported
to your department. My principal guide was all important; without
him the party would have been compelled to have reconoitered in
many places for days & in some for weeks for the purpose of crossing
the pack horses: Many of the Swamps are very extensive, & im-
passable except at certain places. You will observe by a copy of a
letter dated September 1* 1826 * from the Q Master General; &
received by me the 19* of the same month instructing Lieut. Harvey
Brown, the assistant Q Master at this post, to furnish me with the
necessary outfits &", from which date I commenced my preparations.
I also forward a copy of a letter from Gov. Duval dated at Talahassee
Oct. 14* 1826 * requiring my services. I have dated my accounts
from the 17" of October, but I was engaged in preparing immediately
after receiving Gen' Jessups order to Lieut. Brown for the necessary
outfits—If you think I am entitled to my pay from the 19" of Sept
at which time I commenced my outfits, you will confer a great favor
by allowing the same, which will give me Twenty seven days addi-
tional pay—You will also observe by an order from the Adj* Gen"
dated August 4*.* that Lieut D'espenville was instructed to join me
at S*Augustine by the 25” of September if his military & appropriate
duties could be dispensed with; he did not join me until the 15" of

Q Master at this post, & Camp King were worn out in the Service—
You will perceive by my vouchers that I had with me Indian guides
at the request of the Chiefs, which right they claimed under an article
of the Treaty. I was also advised by Col. George M. Brook to receive
them that they might see, that the line was run agreeably to the talk

of this Territory from the evils of an Indian population immediately
on their borders."
From the complaints which have been so repeatedly made, of the
influence of the agents of the Government, and of traders, who reside
contiguous to, and in, the Nation, in creating prejudices against
contemplated negotiations, and by improper interference, and advice,
obstructing the natural currant of the wishes of the Indians, I deemed
it proper to employ Special Agents to go into the Nation and ascer-
tain thoroughly their views, on the subject of removal, to the West
of the Mississippi before it was known that I had any authority on
the subject.”
They were instructed to ascertain as far as practicable, whether
the body of the Nation itself, uncontrouled by the influence to which
I have alluded, or the authority of their own chiefs, would be dis-
posed to emigrate, and, I regret to say, there is a decided repugnance
to it, among all classes of the tribe, and I am satisfied that those who
have written to the Department of War, suggesting their willingness
to go, have consulted more their own wishes, than any correct knowl-
edge, or information of the disposition of the Indians.
The causes which have produced this decided repugnance are
1*—Their entire ignorance of the Country, to which it is proposed
to remove them.
2"—Their attachment to the land of their nativity, which operates
more strongly on Savage than Civilized Communities.
3”—Their fear of the Indian tribes in that quarter, and an appre-
hension that they would all be exterminated.
The extension of their Northen boundary line, and the payment
of the sum appropriated at the first session of the late Congress in
provisions, have operated as auxiliary causes, to make them better
satisfied with their location, than they otherwise would have been.
These are obstacles in the way of any negotiation with them, that
can only be removed by an actual examination of the Country itself,

United States, to protect them against the intrusions, or agressions

of those who inhabit that Country. That they must eventually be
removed, or perish, I think there can be no question. The Territory
which has been given to them in the Treaty of Camp Moultrie and
the removal of the Northern boundary, in conformity with one of
its provisions, contain land enough, capable of Cultivation, to sup-
port a population of the number composing the Seminole tribe, if
it were cultivated with the care and economy, usually employed by
our industrious white population. But with their habits of life, and
ignorance of the arts of husbandry and agriculture, it is imposible
that they can live within the present assigned limits—I understand
that General Gaines has made a report on this subject, * from a
more minute examination of the Country than I was able to give it;
I shall therefore, only refer to his report for an accurate detail of facts.
It is exceedingly difficult to make them believe, that any plan,
proposed by the Government is for their benifit. The traditions of
their fathers, and the history of the past, has impressed them with
melancholy forbodings of their future destiny. They receive with
great distrust any proposition, for the amelioration of their condition,
proceeding from our Government, and it will require something more
than promises to convince them that the humane plan of colonization
recommended by the late administration, and improved and digested
under the present, will be condusive to their improvement, and
happiness. As the Government, however, has discharged its obliga-
tion to humanity, by offering them an exchange highly beneficial to
themselves; it now remains for it to discharge a duty equally imperious
to the people of this Territory, by confining the Indians to their
boundaries, and thus secure the inviolability of the persons, and
protect the property, of the inhabitants of this Territory, until the
Indians shall discover that they cannot live there, and petition for
the exchange; or until Congress shall change the present policy by
which they are governed, of treating with them as independent
nations, and take them under their absolute controul, and Legislate
for them, as Minors', incompetent to take care of their own affairs.
I take great pleasure in saying that every facility and assistance
in his power, was afforded me by the Agent during my visit to the
nation, and I had every reason to beleive that he gave his hearty
co-operation to assist me in executing the wishes of the Government.
I consider it highly important, to continue two military Cantone-
ments in the interior of the Country to confine the Indians within
their limits until they have become permanently located.
I would also, most respectfully recommend that a deputation of
the Chiefs be sent over the Mississippi, to examine the Country,

under the direction of some discreet person, who is friendly to their
Colonization there. The names which I enclose will perhaps be
better qualified than any other of the Tribe, being the most intelligent,
and trust worthy—
Although I have not succeeded in carrying into effect the humane
intension of the Government my visit there, will not be without its
benefits. The Indians were assured in positive terms, that for any
injury in future to the persons, or property of our Citizens the ag-
gressors only would not be holden responsible, but the Nation itself,
whose duty it was to controul their people and to prevent such out-
rages. They appear entirely friendly and I do not think will be
disposed again to commit any improprieties
The presence of a Military force, however, is a salutary check
upon them."

executing the Act of 22" of April 1826, granting preemptions to
settlers in Florida,” I have the honor to report, that compensation
has in no instance been allowed to the Register and Receivers for
extra services in executing the several Acts granting preemption
rights.
A number of the Officers have presented claims for such services
& are under an impression that an allowance will be made by the
Executive Gov" but no final decision has yet been had.
On reference to the Laws of the US, it appears that the first Act in
relation to preemption claims passed on the 10th of May 1800," See
Laws U States Vol 3. page 391. 16 Sect. Under this Act no additional
compensation was allowed the Officers, it was however very limited
as to its object.—The next act on the subject passed on the 3" March
1801." See Laws of U. S. Vol 3 page 429—the 3" 5" & 6th Sections
of this Act, direct the mode in which the right of such claims Should
be decided, and specifies the fees that are to be paid, all of which
were payable by the party claiming the preemption. It is proper to
observe that at this period, the Surveying fees, and fees to the Land
Officers were paid by the purchasers of the public Lands.
The principles of the Act of 1801 were not extended to any other
cases except those of Ohio.
In Mississippi, the Commissioners who were authorized to adjust
private claims, and who received a fixed compensation were also
empowered to grant preemptions to certain Settlers.”
The next Act which passed on this subject, was the Act of the
5th of Feb. 1813." See L U. S. Vol 4 p. 496. This Act invests the
Register and Receiver with judicial powers and authorizes them to
grant the preemption when they are satisfied that the party claiming
has the right—and it grants no compensation except a fee of 25 cts, to
the Register for receiving and filing each claim.
All the subsequent Acts granting preemptions in Missouri," Arkan-
sas," Lousiana" and Florida,” have been based upon the provisions

of that of the 5" of Feb 1813, And the Claims, therefore, of all the
Officers who have acted under those several Acts, including that of Feb
1813 must abide the decision now to be made.
It may here be proper to observe that at the passage of the Act
of the 3" March 1801, the Compensation of the Register was, a half
per cent on the amount of money entered with them, & certain fees
of Office, that of the Receiver was one per ct on the Am" of monies
received. An Act of the 26" of March 1804,” abolished the fees
paid by the purchasers of Public Lands, and gave to the Register &
Rec' a Salary of $500 pryear, and one half proent in addition to
the percentage previously granted to those Officers.
The Act of 1813. and the subsequent Acts relative to the pre-
emptions certainly impose extra duties on particular Land Officers for
which there has been an omission, at least, apparently, on the part of
the Legislature, to provide a special Compensation, except that of
25 cts, to the Register for receiving & filing each claim. Under these
several Acts, and the Claim now presented, two questions arise
First. Can the Executive supply the omission of the Legislature &
grant a fair remuneration to the different Officers who have Acted
under the Several Acts that have been passed?, and
Second If the Executive deem it expedient to grant such remunera-
tion in what manner shall it be made so as to give to each Officer
a reasonable Compensation and in due proportion to the services
rendered?
As to the general principle involved in the 1st Question, I beleive
there has been several instances where the Executive under the
general powers with which it is vested, of causing the Laws to be
executed has supplied the evident omissions of the Legislature, by
remunerating services required by law, but for which the Law had
omitted to provide compensation
If it be decided to grant a compensation in these cases, then a ref-
erence to Legislative provisions in analogous cases would necessarily
be resorted to for establishing a rule for fixing the rate of compensa-
tion. A reference to the Land Laws will shew that where the law has
granted compensation for extra services, it has given to the Officer
$5: a day when a full days work was expected to be performed—as
in the case of Superintendants of public Sales &c.—but in those cases
where the services required of the public Officers did not depend upon
themselves, but upon the convenience or whim of other persons, and
where the performance of the duty might occupy them only a few
minutes in the day or perhaps a whole day, the law has granted a
*See Law U S. vol 3. p. 596. . [Footnote on the MS.]. The section of the act
referred to is in 2 STAT. 282.

compensation in proportion to the services actually rendered. As in
the Case of the Act of the 3'd of March 1803 above referred to, and
in the instances of the several Acts granting relief to the purchasers
of public Lands, which grant fees to the Officers for each case in which
they may Act—the allowance in the latter case is a dollar to each
officer for each case of relinq" of a tract of Land, and in the former,
it was something more than a dollar to each Officer, in every case of a
preemption for one quarter Section.
On a reference to the returns of M" Ward, the present claimant, it
appears that the number of claims acted upon and admitted by him
vary from one to fifty eight on those days on which he was employed
on this business, it would therefore appear that a per diem allowance
would not give a compensation bearing any just proportion to the
services rendered.
I should therefore recommend that the allowance be a specific one
to each Officer for each preemption granted or acted upon—And
having reference to the provisions of the Laws, and the facts, above
stated, that compensation should not be less than $1. and a quarter
for each case, to each officer, nor more than $1.50 exclusive of the
25 ct" allowed by Law to the Register.
It appears from the returns of the Officers at Tallahassee that from
the 1 of Aug 1826 to 31 March 1827, they admitted 325 Claims."

SIR, Your letter of the 30" ulto, has been received." Since my
letter of the 25" ulto to Major Glassell," and that to you of the 7"

give, a preference to the Alachua settlement over that on the Ausilla,
in the selection of the “temporary position,” which he was authorized
to establish last fall.—In that event, accommodations for the single
company intended to occupy it will be necessary; and the labor which
has already been bestowed upon that object, by your preparations,
may not be lost. Should things take this course, the mechanic about
to be discharged from the command; and whose services are repre-
sented as necessary, may be employed at the rate mentioned—He
will not be retained however, a day longer than necessity requires.
With the reduced garrison designed for this position, it is believed,
the necessity will not occur, for sending materials from Charleston or
elsewhere, as requested in one of Maj Glassel's former letters—As the
post is altogether “temporary,” any thing more than comfortable
huts, for the company, would be improper. The transportation of
brick, such a distance, could not be justified by the circumstances of
the case. Suitable chimneys, can be readily constructed with logs
and clay.”

damus from the Judge of this District was duly received,” and should
have been sooner answered but we have delayed doing so until the
Preemption Claims should be settled within the district of Lands
proclaimed for sale in May last.”
We have now to inform you that no case of mandamus under the
preemption Law has occured at this office subsequent to those here-
tofore reported and since the death of Judge Woodward we feel well
assured that no others will occur. Agreeable to your suggestion we
have reseved from sale the half quarter Sections of Land to which the
Claimants would have been entitled had we been permitted to ad-
minister the Law without the interfereance of the Courts and we
have again to renew our objections to the issuing of Patents in those
Cases where entries have been made under Writs of Mandamus—It
is proper that the department should be informed that in those the
whole responsibility was assumed by the Judge, and that the Register
and Receiver did in most of those Cases even examine the testimony
on which the Writs were issued—As an evidence of the inattention
and incapability of Judge Woodward at that period to discharge his
official duties we inclose a Copy of the evidence on which a Mandamus
was granted in the Case of Peter W. Gotier assignee of A W Sauls
from which it will appear very satisfactorily that the claimant was
not entitled under the Law—We believe that errors not less fatal have
occured in many other instances and that the only means by which
fraud and imposition on the Government can be prevented will be to
remand these cases to us for Correction—It is a fact well known
that Judge Woodward never examined the evidence in any of these

We are convinced that he had no permanent residence in Florida
prior to 1826 according to the Strict letter of the Law he would not
have been entitled to a preemption but as he was one of the earliest

Whilst, on this subject, I would also mention, that the corporation,
have likewise possessed themselves of two or three other lots of land
which, I believe, has not been assigned to their use, by the Secretary
of War;—these they have leased out for 4 or 5 years;—on one of them
was a large, old, stone building, known as the dragoon barracks,
which they rased to the ground & sold the stones."
This city is very poor, and needs all the assistance which it can ob-

Settlements should be early formed there to prevent the hunting
incursions of the Indians which leads to depredations on the Stock
of individuals where they are thinly settled & important from the
recent removal of the Troops from the Oscilla Country to Pensacola.
I would suggest for your consideration whether or not it is desireable
to have Forbes Claim Townshipped entire, with a view to ascertain
the quantity of land contained theiren. As I have strong grounds
for beleif that there are 2:000:000 of acres in the survey and I believe
their grant was for 1200:000 acres—Should you deem it important I
should like your authority for doing so that I might take advantage
of dry seasons to accomplish it: as heretofore I was unable to effect
it from high waters.
I have just received a letter from my deputy Col” J W Exum at
Pensacola: the the following is extracted for your information—“On
my arrival I made application to the Mayor, his Clerk, and several
of the Aldermen of the city as also the Keeper of the Archives & City
Surveyor for the plan of the City, I was unable to obtain one, therefore
by the assistance of the City Surveyor, & Keeper of the Archives,
I have been employed ever since I reached this place in measuring &
beleive I have or will have in a few days a correct plan
“I did at first find some difficulty in measuring after leaving the
English plan—the measurement being in perches or Arpents of Paris
measure—that difficulty is surmounted but that is not the worst.
I fear—I find some claims commence at a picket #45. 10:15 & as far
as 25 miles from a defined point. The word about appears to be
a common Commencment & running about N. N. E. (or some other
mariner point) to a piquit so many Parisian perches &" but never
Closes”
The foregoing will give you some idea of the maner in which the
surveys of private Claims have been executed and prepares my mind
at once for a contined scene of vauge & clashing interests—The
Surveyors however which have been selected for this important duty
I have the most implicit Confidence will perform it in a masterly
manner, and when the Surveys shall have passed the ordeal of this
office, I trust will be found to meet with your entire approbation.
By next mail I shall forward my quarterly accounts for the quarter

SIR, I received your letter post dated Washington June 1" acknowl-
edging the receipt of the papers forwarded by me"—I have enclosed
to you a package by this days mail in which eleven cases are impeached
which I hope you will also file as caveats in the claims set forth—
You say in your letter that you have filed them as caveats to await
such legal decisions as may be had thereon–From that expression
I would infer that the validity of those entries must be determined by
the Judiciary—It has been the practice of the Register and Receiver
after granting certificates to reinvestigate claims and set aside entries
where in their judgement they had been obtained on incorrect testi-
mony or by any other improper means—
From what I have understood from them, that an entry made under
preemption claim might be made void either at their office or at yours
any time previous to the issuing of the Patent, which opinion I
supposed they had obtained by a correspondence with you—
If the validity of these entries and justness of these claims are to
be determined by legal decisions, I am at some loss to know in what
way it is to be had—Some of the cases depend on testimony, others on
questions of Law arising out of facts, which appear in the office of the
Register and Receiver—
If the Institution.” I represent had such evidence of title as could
be read in a Court of justice, these questions could be tried by bringing
actions against those who are in possession of the land—Will a
decision be had here, or at Washington, -and in what way will the
question be brought up-
Will you do me the favour to give me some information on these
Subjects—or your opinion—I expected you would have answered my
letter which accompanied the papers you acknowledged the receipt
of—Perhaps you considered it unnecessary or out of the line of your
business"—

SIR By the last mail I received a communication from Major
Cross of the 25th May.”
I had previously received a Copy of the order from the Adjutant
General to Gen. Gaines dated 15" May,” but as yet have received
no orders for the removal of the other company now attached to my
command.
Notwithstanding the term “temporary” used in referrence to the
continuance of one Company in the interior of Florida, I am led to
believe, from the strong desire therefor, & apprehensions of the re-
newal of Indian outrages manifested by many very respectable
Citizens of the Territory, that the Secretary will be induced to con-
tinue, at least one company for a much longer period, than his order
appears to Contemplate.
Should one company be continued even for the winter, it will be
absolutely necessary to have brick, & lime as stone cannot be procured
in this quarter that will answer to make a chimney: lumber will also
be wanted, which may probably be procured on the S" Johns at a
much less cost than at Charleston.
On the subject of the Oklawaha, I have the honor to enclose you
a copy of the report of Lt Searight, who returned on the 18" ult.
from clearing the River, which he did more superficially, than he was
ordered, in consequence of the sickness of nearly one half of his

River seems not to be much enlarged by this accession of water: but
receiving its character from the Spring Run, which is very deep and
clear, is seldom less than eight feet, and frequently fifteen or twenty
in depth:—this depth continuing for some miles as well as its trans-
parency. The bottom is, however, very irregular.
The Guide twice directed to take what I conceived to be not the
main channel—Upon inquiry he informed that the larger streams
dissipated themselves in the Swamps. This I did not then credit:
however, I followed his direction whilst descending; resolving to
ascend the largest stream. This I did: but was obliged, ultimately,
to make use of two very narrow and shallow passes—and although I
carefully examined the shore, which was between me and the larger
body of water, I could not discover any stream which I supposed was
the one I was in search of.—Small streams are continually running
into and out of the channel—so that within a few miles it may vary
from ten to twenty or thirty yards in width, and from two feet to six
or eight in depth—and conversely.
The water in the narrow passes was less than two feet: frequently
the boats, which draw less than a foot, got fast in the mud, or sand,
as it might happen. One of the places, through which I was com-
pelled to pass, is not more than nine or ten feet wide and two deep—
'Tis a mere cut-off, perhaps twenty yards in length—a larger passage
is close by this, but at present there are not more than five or six
inches of water in it. For half a mile above, and some distance
below, the stream is very narrow and quite shallow; and here and
elsewhere the River is difficult to navigate, even with canoes, from
the short and frequent bends, and the rapidity of its current; some-
times running directly (perpendicularly) upon the bank, and with
such velocity that the boats, with no little difficulty, are kept off the
shore, with poles; oars being here useless—Generally there is too
great a depth of water, or of mud, to use setting poles.
The highest water-marks I saw, were a little more than three feet—
but the more distinct, and where the water appears to continue the
longest time, are about two feet above the present level."

SIR, Herewith is respectfully transmitted a copy of Colonel Clinches
communication of the 8” of June,” and also a copy of my answer
thereto, of yesterdays date *—The tenor of the information, official
or otherwise received from Florida corroborates the opinion enter-
tained at the Department, that perfect tranquility is restored in that
quarter, and that the outrages committed there in the winter were
not indicative of any general Spirit of Indian hostility, but, rather,
ascribable to the wantonness of a few individuals of the tribe, whilst
the Nation, dreampt not of War or devastation.—Colonel Clinches
better knowledge however, & approximate position, enable him to
pass a maturer judgement on this subject—and hence, as a precau-
tionary measure, the continuance of the two Companies at the Post
near the Alachua Agency, which he has strongly recommended, has
been unconditionally approved. The “further Orders,” which may
be needful in the case, are now appropriately referred to the action

I am informed by the Commissary General of subsistence, that you
have been authorized to draw upon the depot at Charleston for the
necessary supply of provisions—In doing so, you will, as agent of this
Department, advise Lt Rigail," who is acting in its behalf at Charles-
ton, minutely as to the course to be pursued in making the shipment
and endeavor to meet the transport at the head of navigation, with
boats to take out her cargo, or at the store house at Picolata, so that
she may not be detained.
The suggestion to store the supplies in the first instance at that place,
seems judicious, as it might happen, that your boats would not pre-
cisely meet the transport on her arrival, or might be insufficient to take
the whole of the cargo: But, if that course be adopted, a guard should
be kept there for the safety of the supplies until they can be carried up.
Perhaps, when the waters rise in the Ocklawaha a small coasting vessel,
large enough to take the requisite supply of provisions from Charleston,
could ascend to the mouth of the creek—If it should promise this, after
your examination of it, Lt Rigail should be advised on the subject, and
informed as to the draft of water, in order that he may make his con-
tract conform to it.
It appears that Col Clinch has fixed upon your position, as inti-
mated in a former letter and that both the companies now there, will
remain for the present. The necessary accommodations must, there-
fore be prepared for them—but it must never be lost sight of, that the
position is temporary, and that the accommodations should be of a
corresponding character.
Not knowing, precisely, the kind of boat suited to the occasion,
orders cannot be given, to forward the two, you say will be required,
from Charleston. Can they not be built by the troops? Or by storing
at Picolata, will not the three you have, be amply sufficient?"

For the gratification of the citizens, I proposed for three separate
places, though I was aware, at the time that at two of them, no
bridge could be built for the sum;-at the third place, which is
the most eligible, the owner of the land refuses to give a right of
way; —North of this, about one eigth of a mile, the property on each
side of the river belongs, I believe, to the U. States, and the situation
is very good, though not quite so convenient as the others;-I invited
proposals for this place also;-On each side of the river where the
bridge must cross there is quite a wide marsh, over which, it will be
necessary to make a substantial causeway;-I invited proposals for
it, but received no answer bid;—I would suggest, whether this might
not be done by the U.S. Troops;-if so, the materials extra pay &"
would amount, I think to about $150 or $200

GEORGE GRAHAM TO DAVID THOMAS
[NA:GLO, Misc. Lets. Sent, Bk. 191°]
July 20th 1827.
DAVID THOMAS, Esq Tallahassee F
SIR, Your letter of the 3’d July inclosing descriptions of eleven cases
of preemptions in which you request patents to be suspended,”
has been rec" & Caveats entered in those cases.
All the evidence of title which the Deaf & Dumb Asylum of K” has
at present, or can have in relation to the disputed cases which you have
reported to this Office, is, the law granting the preemption, the au-
thority to the Agent to locate and the approval of the same by the
Secretary of the Treasury.
The manner in which they are to proceed under such title is a ques-
tion on which the Trustees or Agent will take proper legal advice.
I presume, however, that the evidence of title is entirely sufficient
to enable them to institute suits in Chancery against the parties
holding preemption Certif" issued by the Reg. & Rec. for the purpose
of trying the right of title.
The extent to which the Executive can act, in those cases where
preemption Certif" have been issued, is to withhold patents, when the
Cert" has been irregularly issued.
The Reg & Rec. have been requested to report all Cases, where
on a revision of the testimony, they are of opinion that the Cert. has
been irregularly granted,” and patents will be withheld in the Cases
thus reported by them.

there is Corners marked all through the Country many of which are

that at the change of Flags all the property in the Town was delivered
over by the Spanish Authorities to the Commissioner authorised to
receive it & put, by him in charge of the military authorities, in which
it remained until Dec. 1821, When the President of the U. States
made a distribution of it, between the civil & military authorities;—
I was accordingly ordered (I enclose a copy of the order) to execute
the orders of the President, which was accordingly done, & the civil
authorities were immediately put in possession of the lots & buildings
appropriated to them by the President, & I took charge of the re-
mainder, (including the lines of the town, & the two lots ef which
the municipal authorities have rented out);-Since then, no other
disposition has been made of the public property that I am aware
of;—at the last Session of Congress the public square was given to
the City & this is the only property which they legally possess.—I
made application to the Mayor for his authority for taking possession
of this Property, & he says that he has none.—
I have the honor to enclose you a note which I addressed the Mayor;
notwithstanding which he persisted in pulling down the pillars, in
consequence of which I applied to the U. S. Attorney, (a copy of my
letter, I also enclose) who took legal measures to stop them.

I think the conduct of the Mayor very extraordinary, for certainly
no injury could accrue, by the short delay which I requested, & I can
account for it, in no other manner, but this, the stones are worth from
$500 to $800 and he, himself has purehased is to receive them, for
filling a part of the ditch which will not cost more than $100 or $150.—
I think, Sir, that admitting the Sec. at War has permitted them to
occupy this property, that the case is in no manner altered;—for then,
they are only tenants & surely have no right to destroy the property,
& appropriate the proceeds, to their own benefit.
I am the more anxious that my conduct respecting this property
should meet your approbation, because the Commanding officer re-
fused to interfere, & only a sense of duty, could have induced me, to
the disagreeable office of interfering with the civil authorities of the

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL 33
[NA: OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.: AD]
[July, 1827]
To The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in
Congress assembled.
This memorial of the Legislative Council of Florida humbly repre-
seneth, that under your patronage they have beheld our Territory
prosperously Situated: increasing in population, and gradually de-
veloping those resources of wealth, with which She is by nature so
lavishly endowed.
With due gratitude for past favours, your memorialists, from a
belief, that the General Government will ever conceive the growth of
Florida, intimately connected with the prosperity of our rising
republic, have again presented themselves as petitioners before you,
and ask that relief only, which Congress in its wisdom may deem
expedient to grant.
Your memorialists represent as the most serious grievance, which
afflicts our Territory, the present location of the indian tribes within
our boundary. But above all that they have been permitted to
roam through the country, plundering those whom their avarice
might seize on, and murdering those whom their revenge might Select.
The tract of Country assigned them by the treaty of 1823 * has
always been complained of by them, as incompetent to their Support;
and the additional grant Subsequently made them, has been the
occasion of much dissatisfaction among many of our citizens; and
probably not without cause. In addition to this, the present location
is in the pathway of our Settlers, and has already seriously impeded
the settlement of the fairest part of Florida, and will now cloud all
its prospects. The land in this vicinity is excellent, and but for the
obstruction of this unfortunate, though not less obnoxious tribe of
beings, would before this, have borne on the current of the St Johns
all the rich and luxuriant products of a tropical climate. Besides
they have never gone within their boundary, but have scattered
themselves in different parts of the Territory, and to the great annoy-
ance of our citizens. They have stripped the corn from our fields
before our eyes; they have burned our houses and murdered our
citizens. All this they did, and have been doing for the last season
within twenty miles of the walls of St Augustine and with impunity.
But more recent outrages have been committed which has thrown

a damper on the spirits of our agriculturists, and present our Country
under a gloomy aspect. The most inhuman butcheries have been
committed by them; a whole family has fallen a sacrifise to their
vengeance, and individuals have been murdered while on the high
way and engaged in that industry which constitutes the Soul, and
energy of our country. Our corn houses have been broke and
plundered; our cattle killed, and our citizens driven from their homes,
and threatened with all the horrors of indian cruelty, within the
space of the last two months, and within forty miles of our capitol.
The vigilance of our Governor and the promptness of our militia
have for the present checked their outrages, and in some degree
quieted the fears of our citizens, but at what time, and in what place,
the bent bow will let slip its arrow, the blood of our citizens, will we
fear, soon proclaim. In this gloomy situation of our Territory, your
memorialists beg the speedy removal of these people out of the
Territory. If they are dissatisfied with their present Situation as
appears: if they have never complied with the stipulations of their
treaty as is manifest; if they have been guilty of the most glaring
and unprovoked outrages certainly they have forfeited their claim
to humanity, and are the fit subjects of our policy. We most earnestly
recommend that they be forthwith, called to their boundary: and
commissioners appointed to hold a new treaty with them, stipulating
their immediate removal from the Territory to the Indian country
west of the Mississippi and that the commissioners be vested with
full power to carry the Same into execution.
It is not to be forgotten that these indians have already cost the
United States more than one hundred thousand dollars, and that
their present condition requires another appropriation or esle they
will be compelled to have resort to unlawful means for subsistence.
Your memorialists would further recommend, that a regiment be
ordered to some point on the St Johns, at as early a period as possible
for the protection of our frontier settlements, which are in that region
entirely unprotected. Especially do your memorialists urge the
adoption of this measure since it is by some confidently believed that
the nation is bent on war; whether true, or not your memorialists
cannot say.”

DELEGATE WHITE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla.: LS]
[July, 1827]
HON JAMES BARBOUR Secretary of War,
Sir, I hope that I may not be deemed importunate, if I beg leave
again to request your attention to the subject of the Indians in
Florida, so vitally important to the people, whom I have the honor to
represent. Were I not again and again to press on the attention of
the department of War the necessity of removing them, I should
virtually abandon the interests of my Constituents, and leave their
persons a prey to the capricious mercy of the savage, and their prop-
erty, subject to his precarious sense of moral honesty, and obligation
to the laws—You have learned from the correspondence with your
Department that a large family of women and children, since the
meeting of the present Congress, have been butchered by these
Indians, and their bodies consumed in the flames of their dwellings,
within 20 miles of Tallahassee. If then Sir, I did not urge to this
Government by every obligation, of justice and policy, by every Con-
stitutional injunction, to secure to the Citizen of these U. States the
inviolability of his person and property I should be unworthy to be
trusted with the destines of a people, whose confidince it would be my
pride to possess, and whose best wellfare will never cease to be the
ruling principle of my conduct. With what confidence, could I meet
them on my return if I had been silent here, when there they had not
been safe, in their houses? If I remained unmoved, when helpless
women and children had been butchered and burnt. No Sir, it must
still be my pride, that I was importunate, if unsuccessfull, and that J
laboured assiduously if I laboured in vain.—
There are many considerations suggesting the necessity of the
speedy removal of the Florida Indians—The early history of the
States, is full of the danger, ever incidint to frontier settlements, with
Savage borderers—I will not trouble you with examples—I mention
the fact, barely to shew its universal application to the planters of
that Territory. Every Settlement is on an Indian border—Every
plantation in East Florida is necessarily a Frontier, in many instances,
from 20 to 60 miles distant, from a Civilized neighbour. I will not
waste your time, by pointing out the perils to which a planter so
situated is subjected: The inability to procure relief, when he is
threatened with the Tomahawk: the certainty of insult, when his
wild Visitant, infuriated as he ever is by drunkenness, would sacrifice
a family for the refusal of rum: when he dare not complain from the
dread of vengeance, unrestrained by the apprehension of dedection—
In a word, when the constant sense of impending danger, damps his

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 899
exertions and embitters his life, is it wonderful in such a state of
insecurity, that new settlers are detered from coming, and old ones
driven away? It is a fact sir well known, that Major Woodruff late
of the army, now one of the largest and most valuable planters on
the East of the Suwanee, has long been on the point of returning to
Georgia, and nothing has saved to us that judicious planter, but the
immensity of his crops. He has already had one man murdered at
his house, and after the recent melancholy fate of the Carrs, his sense
of insecurity will be doubled. And this is the condition of East
Florida. No planter would venture to leave his family at home in
the country, during his own absense. In a thickly settled community
the presence of these indiands would not be so dreadful an evil.
There one neighbour would be a safeguard to an other. There too,
the weight of population, would give to the white man a consciousness
of security, and to the Indian a corresponding dread of detection.
There punishment would follow on the heels of crime, and operate
to prevent its repetition. There would be the moral influence of
civilized example. Here Sir, it is awfully the reverse. The Indians
are the prevailing population, and the whites are considered, as solitary
and unprotected intruders: But I will not dwell on this picture. I
will shew you a happier prospect. I will refer you to the condition
of Florida west of the Suwanee—filling with emigrants from every
portion of the union—Forrests falling before the axe of Industry and
fields of cotton blooming where they stood—I will shew you a city,
in the place of a wigwam—and a press inculcating the mild principles
of republicanism, where the war hoop was lately heard. And, Sirr
why is this? The land claims have been adjusted, and the savages
expelled—it needs no comment.
I might point out the impolicy, to the Gen' Government itself of
the present location—That they have already paid near $200.000,
in the few years since it was made—That they have given away
4,032.000 acres of land a portion of which is better fitted for sugar
and cotton, than any in the Union. That the game was exhausted,
and annual appropations must be made to keep them from starving.
That the want of game, would drive them to depredations on the
cattle of the whites, who by retaliation would render bloodshed, if
not war inevitable, and finally, their utter extermination. That the
ground now covered by their location, embraced many private grants,
which the U States must pay for. That their present position ren-
dered military posts indispensible, which were more costly in an
unsettled country, I might urge that it was impolitic if not dangerous
in case of invasion, to leave an interlal foe, as numerous as the whites,
in a frontier remote from the States, and inaccessible, in the moment
of need, to be tampered with, by such enemies, as it has been our lot

to find. Sir, such men as Nicols, and Ambrister, and Arburthnot,
aided by British arms and British gold operating on savage cupidity
would revolutionise East Florida and massacre the whites, before the
people of Georgia could hear of the danger.
There have been brought to my notice many case of individual
damage, committed by Indians on individuals the property of respecta-
ble planters, particularly in the county of Alachua. This Sir, is a
growing County; with a large body of good lands, and many wealthy
landholders. Such, and so great, I I am given to understand are the
losses sustained by the inhabitants of this county, that it would be abare
actof justice, to direct, the Indian agent, in accordance with the act of
1802,” to remunerate the sufferers, out of the annuity allowed by
congress to the tribe-Independent of the justice to the parties, in
making the Indians pay for the stock they had stolen, it would have
the double effect of preventing the repetition of such offences in future,
and of curing all heartburnings arising from the necessary retaliation of
the whites. It would compel the Indians to rely more on their own
honest industry, and by preventing feuds and private quarrels spare
to humanity the recurrence of such dreadful scenes as have just been
presented by the tragedy of the Carrs. To this desirable resultnothing
is necessary but to direct the Indian agent, out of the annuity granted
them, to pay to the people of Alachua, whatever damage and loss, he
may ascertain by proof to have been sustained-I submit this proposi-
tion to you, in full confidence that you will leave nothing undone, which
humanity and justice require you to do.—
I will not here detain you Sir, with the importance of East Florida,
it was fully appreciated by the Government before the purchase was
made—That importance is in no danger of being diminished as the
Country is known, and its resources developed—As long as sugar is a
staple, and cotton a necessary, as long as the fruits of the tropics are
prized—and as long as health is deemed a blessing, East Florida will
be important to the planter and St Augustine necessary to the valetu-
dinarian. And now Sir, it rests with the Government of the U States
whether this shall be its most important acquisition, or remain a barren
wild, safe, only to the savage tread, whether it shall teem with every
fruit, and every luxury, springing from the arts of civilization, or
whether the hut of the honest planter, shall prove his cemetery. I
have already addressed to the Department a letter on this subject. I
have appealed to the Government on the behalf of my suffering fellow
citizens: by every claim of justice and humanity: by the lives and

property of my constituents, by the horrors of the present, and the
hopes of the future: I have appealed to the true policy of the Govern-
ment; to its econemy in peace, to its safety in war: to the obligation
upon it to protect its suffering Citizens—It is now ascertained beyond

Congress—The remainder of the appropiation of twenty thousand
dollars will soon be exhausted—Your Agents in Florida inform the
Government that the game is destroyed, and the climate and country
unpropitious to the cultivation of corn.—The Indians are now reduced
to the necessity of subsistence by the plunder of the inhabitants of
East Florida, or to the dreadful alternative of absolute starvation—
This is no picture of fancy, it is an awful reality—our only resource is
the interposition of the Executive
I have therefore most respectfully to ask, that a commission may be
constituted to treat with them for a cession of their lands, (which are
not adapted to any cultivation known to them,) for others west of the
Mississippi, where there is game and land less valuable to the U States,
and suited to their natural habits, and cultivation.
The most of these Indians are a part of the Creek Nation, and could
be incorperated with the emigrant party—They avow their willingness
I understand to go, and indeed when they perceive, as they must do,
that they must emigrate, or perish, there is no question as to the selec-
tion they would make.”
I have the honor to be with high considerations of respect Y Ob"
Servant.

SIR, I have received your letter of the 31* ultimo," in relation to
the encroachments of the Corporate authority of St Augustine, on
the public reservations at that place.
It is perfectly clear from the documents furnished, that the Civil
Authority even of the United States, has no claim under the original
distribution made by the president, to the property in question. And
as to the municipal authority of St Augustine, it can have no claim
whatever, under that distribution, for it was merely a division of the
property transfered by the Spanish authority, between the Civil func-
tionaires of the United States and the military.
Whatever property may have been given to the Corporation of St
Augustine by Acts of Congress, will not be interfered with—but,
taking the original distribution for your guide, you will take and
retain possession of all the lots &" reserved to the Military, until some
authority be produced coming from a competent source, to justify a
surrender of them.

Augt 18, 1827.
COL° ROBT BUTLER Tallahassee F.
Sir Your favor of the 24 Ulto." covering a letter from y' Deputy,
M” Exum, complaining of the difficulty of surveying private claims
in consequence of the refusal of the claimants to shew, or aid in
shewing their boundaries, has been rec". The act passed at the last
Session of Congress * relative to the surveying of private claims varies
materially from that originally drafted, & is defective in several
respects, yet no provision was made in the Act as drafted against
the particular difficulty your Deputy complains of, to wit, that the
claimants will not shew their boundaries. It is difficult if not im-
practicable to make any legal provisions by which the owner of a
claim confirmed on a survey or grant could be compelled to shew
their boundaries. The advantages however of obtaining a resurvey
& procuring a title immediately from the U.S. are such as it was
presumed would have made every claimant anxious to obtain such
resurvey & title. The object of a resurvey on the part of the U
States is to ascertain the vacant & public Lands. The claimant has
obtained, it is true, a legal right under the confirmation but in cases
of controversy as to title, he must be able to shew in a Court of
Justice that his survey was legally made under the Spanish Gov' &
must prove his boundaries. Whereas by a resurvey and title derived
from the U. S. he is relieved from all difficulty. These advantages
ought to induce all honest bone-fide claimants to give every possible
facility & information by which their claims could be resurveyed and
a different course can be accounted for only from ignorance or fraudu-
lent intentions. When the refusal arises from the first cause every
possible precaution should be taken to satisfy the party of its evil
consequences and every exertion should be made to survey his claim
correctly, but the attempts of the latter should not be permitted to
arrest the progress of public surveying.
Under the provisions of the 7th Section of the Act of the last
Session, your Surveyors should be furnished with as accurate a
description of each claim confirmed as the records will afford, with
this description, which is all important, and such documents and
information as he can procure from the claimant he is to make the
survey, but if he cannot ascertain the location from the description

thus obtained, and the claimant refuses or declines to furnish the
necessary information then the Law cannot be carried into effect in
relation to such claim and the Surveyor will proceed to survey the
residuary Lands in the Township as public Lands, leaving the claimant
to establish his claim in a Court of Justice, in case of controversy
with other confirmed claims or with purchases under direct title from
the U States.
Every precaution should be taken to give notice to claimants of
the time when the District of Country in which their claims are
situated will be surveyed and in the public notice which you were in
my letter of the [blank]. last requested to give," you should state
distinctly the course that will be pursued, when the boundaries of a
claim cannot be ascertained from the documents furnished by the
Keeper of the Archives or those in the possession of the Claimant.
It is proper to observe that the law presumes that the information
to be derived from the records will enable the Deputy to locate &
resurvey the claim, but if this information does not enable him to
make the survey and he is obliged to depend upon the information
of the claimant he should make to you a particular Statement of the
facts, to enable you to exercise the power with which you are invested
by the last clause of the 7th Sect: of the Act of Feb’ last.—If marked
trees are shown by the claimant the Deputy will generally be able,
with tolerable accuracy, to ascertain, whether the age of the marks
corresponds with the date of the survey.
The Act of the last Session (8 Feb) is altogether silent as to the
mode of surveying the few claims in West Florida which were confirmed
on account of occupation or cultivation previous to 1819. If there-
fore the Commissioners Certif. of Confirmation does not designate
the manner in which they are to be surveyed, these Lands must be
surveyed as other public Lands designating the Section in which each
claim respectively may lie, and particularly noting whether the im-
provements extend to more than one Section and whether there be
two different improvements in the same Section. With this infor-
mation the claims may be located in entire Sections or by eighths of
Sections in as compact a form as possible so that the actual improve-
ments do not interfere.
As the survey of the private claims will be attended with some
difficulty your Deputies may be unwilling to enter to Contracts to
survey them or may fail to execute those which they have undertaken.
You should therefore let them distinctly understand that no other
surveying will be contracted for until the private claims are surveyed,
and that such Deputies who contract & execute their contracts for
* Ante, p. 768.

private claims, will have the preference in obtaining Contracts for
other surveying—and in all cases where a Deputy fails to execute a
contract for surveying private claims no other should be granted to
him.—
Being thus possessed of the views of this Office & having before you
the laws and Reports of the Commissioners, it is hoped & believed
that you will be able by a careful investigation of the subject to give
such particular instructions to your Deputies as will ensure the sur-
vey of the private claims in West Florida. The survey of them in
East Florida will probably be attended with more difficulty & embar-
rassment. It is desireable therefore that you should suggest such
amendments of the Act of the last Session as experience may point
out as necessary, and I will submit them to the Land Comm” "

Township 7 Range 12 N & East. on which the principle improvements
of the said Abraham Philips were situated. The other eigth of this

cultivated the same quarter Section. Some time afterwards the
attorney of Ephraim Philips, the other heir of Abraham Philips
applied at this office for an entry on an eigth of Land in a different
Section which had been located by the Agent of the Kentucky Assylem.
The Register and Receiver refused to permit the entry, 1* Because
the claim of Abraham Philips whether located by himself or his heirs
must be confined to an entire legal quarter Section, and could not be
located in two eights of different Sections. 2" because the land
intended to be entered had been previously located by the Agent of

To WILLIAM M M*CARTY Acting Govt of Florida
SIR. Various applications (among which is the enclosed,” from a
very respectable citizen of this vicinity have been made to me for
permission to purchase negroes, from the Indians of this Territory;
entertainting doubts as to my authority to grant the permissions
Solicited, I thought it proper, to refer the Subject to the Superin-
tendant, for decision.
I have no question, that in many cases, if not all it would be an
essential advantage to the Indians, to Sell their Slaves at a reasonable
and fair price—The capitol realized from the Sales, might be invested
in much more useful & profitable property—The negroes of the
Seminole Indians, are wholly independent, or at least regardless of
the authority of their masters; and are Slaves but in name; they
work only when it suits their inclination and are their own Judges,
as to what portion, of the products of their labour, Shall go to their
owners; their habits are, with few exceptions, indolent in the ex-
treme, on which account, their example is calculated to have a bane-
ful influence upon the Indians, whom it is desirable and necessary to
withdraw as fast as practicable from their erratic and idle habits, to
the pursuits and practice of industry, without which, they will not,
as game is rapidly diminishing, be able much longer, to exist in
Florida
A more Substantial reason however, than the one above offered in
favour of allowing the Indians to dispose of their Slaves exists in the
fact, of the great influence the Slaves possess over their masters, which
is uniformly exercised in exciting their jealously of the whites, whom
they artfully represent, as being hostile to all who differ from them
in complection, and the recollection of the many acts of injury and
injustice, which the Indians have received from their white bretheren,
it may be easily imagined, would make them give ready credence to
these cunning Suggestions of their negroes; whom they look upon,
rather as fellow Sufferers and companions in misery than as inferiors.
There are Several owners of slaves, who have resided Some years
in the Territory, but who really belong to the creek nation, to which
they are desirous to return; but cannot prevail upon their Slaves to
accompany—for which reason, they have made repeated demands
for liberty to sell them I have refused, because uninstructed relative

property. The laws of most of the States have sanctioned this course,
and in the case of defaulting Collectors of Internal Revenue, the acts
of Congress expressly direct that the Treasury Warrants to be issued

that any departure from this course, whereby a loss shall accrue to

SIR, It is the opinion of M* Allen & myself that, a Sale of public
lands in East Florida Should be advertised for the spring of 1728.”
There are many who wish to purchase, in this Territory, tho perhaps
not those lands now surveyed—It would bring settlers to the country
& encourage an examination of the soil—It is probable that the most
of the private land Claims will then be Settled, & we are of opinion
that much good public land will remain to the government.

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your very in-

for the particular manner in which you have compiled with my request
of the 24th July.”
The instructions given to my Deputies together with their patient
forbearance, and Solicitations have overcome the difficulties pretty
generally; and I have every reason to believe that they will happily
succeed in the execution of their contracts—
Inclosed you will receive a diagram exhibiting the manner which the
private claims are laid down and the residuary lands connected—The
corners under my instructions are marked with the claimants name
and U.S. fronting the public lands: independant of the usual marks—
To enable me to render perfect my returns, I request you will have
the goodness to direct this Office to be furnished with a copy of the
field notes of a Township having private claims therein which are
approved and suggest any alterations you may deem necessary in the
draft now forwarded.
I shall take occasion to examine the Subject of improvement on the
present law; relating to private claims; and will furnish Such Sugges-
tions in time for the meeting of Congress, as my reflections produce.

SIR By the last mail I had the honor to receive your communi-
cation of the 16” August.”
Under a belief, when I first came here, that this post would be as
permanent as the continuance of the Indians on these lands, I had
laid off the officers quarters to have chimnies of brick in the centre
of each block: I shall however now make them of logs, and at the
ends.—I have also, ever since my arrival used every exertion to
curtail, as much as possible, expence to the United States, by sawing
lumber; in which I have so far succeeded, as to have a sufficiency
for tollerable comfort, altho' more is wanted; to supply which I keep
one saw in constant opperation, which is all my present diminished
force will admit of.
I lately sent the Acting Ass. Q Master to examine the direct land
route from this to Palatka on the S" Johns. to ascertain whether a
waggon road could be easily made: and having, for many reasons,
strong doubts that the channel of the Oklawaha, partially cleared
out by Lieut Searight, in June last, was not the best or deepest, I
have again dispatched him with a boat and five men to endeaver
to ascertain if there is not a better one; and was under a hope that
his return would have enabled me to forward by this mail, both his
and the Acting Ass. Quartermaster's report for your information on
the question as to the most economical mode of supplying this post.”
They shall be forwarded as soon as practicable.

SIR On the 22" September " I stated to you that I would trans-

and Searight, on the land and water routes to Palatka, so soon as
the return of the latter would enable me to do so.
You will see by Lieut Searight's that he has found a much better
channel than at first discovered; and, inasmuch as he thinks the
river two feet lower than its usual height, there is every ground to
believe that it may be rendered navigable for boats drawing three
feet water.
Had I another company here, I think, with the addition of Negroes
that would be furnished for their rations by the inhabitants of
Alachua, to further an object so important to them, I could effect it,
at least so far as to secure great advantages to both parties.

SIR, In obedience to your orders I have examined the Country
between this Post and Palatka, on the St. John's, as carefully as the
nature of the duty required, and have the honor of making the
following REPORT:—
The nearest route for a road, would be in a direction from this,
N.E. varying a few points to the N. & E. in order to obtain the
highest land—the distance about 50 miles.—The first 7 or 8 on this
route is generally a white sand ridge; from thence to the outlet of
Orange Lake, a distance of about 20 miles, the Country is low and
* Proclamation, if any, not found.

interspersed with cypress, clear water ponds and swamps, which
extend from Orange Lake to the Oklawaha, in a general direction
from N. W. to S. E;—during the wet season, this whole extent of
Country is inundated;—the water on its surface being from 6 to 18
inches in depth.—There is but one place, where the Orange Lake
Creek could be bridged, with any prospect of its remaining when
the waters were high, or of its being useful when they were low—
this is, at the high banks between the upper & lower crossing places,
used by Indians,—A Bridge could be constructed at this spot, of
30 feet span, at slight expense and labour.—From this Creek to Deep
Creek, 6 miles, the Country continues low, the soil firm, the route
crosses frequently little runs—connecting cypress ponds and swamps
with the Oklawaha, which will render it necessary to causeway in
one or two places—The banks of Deep Creek are so low, that it will
be difficult to make a substantial bridge, and will require 10 rods
causewaying on either side.—A Flat bridge, of about 40 feet, could
be constructed, based on mud-sills and supported by braces to trees,
above and below, and connected with the causeway, which would
probably be the most durable, at the least expense of time and
labour—It would require renewing, with every year, in the covering
only.—Eight miles from Deep Creek this route unites from Wantons
to Palatka, distant from Palatka 8 miles.—After uniting with this
road there remains but one Creek to pass, over which can be thrown
a Bridge of logs and poles that will answer every purpose.—The
Country continues low & in many places covered with water in the
rainy season, but the soil is so firm that no causewaying will be nec-
essary.—After leaving Orange Lake Creek, another route might be
had, by taking a direction a little E. of N. which would pass the
Head of Deep Creek and an extensive cypress swamp, uniting with
the road from Wanton's—distant from Deep Creek 8 or 10 miles,
and from Palatka 20 miles;—three or four miles of the last 20, would
be through a swamp, which requires causewaying, in any season, and
is altogether impassable in the wet.
No road can be obtained which will be serviceable when the streams
are high.—A rough wagon road may be made, on the nearest route,
that will answer for all the purposes of transportation in dry weather,
in extent, for $499,99 $.400 supposing it to be cut by U. S. Troops.

SIR, I have received your letters dated the 6"" and 7" insts * and in
reply to the first, I have to inform you, that the Kings road is to be
repaired under your direction from St Augustine to the point six
miles north of the St Johns river, where Cap" Clarke commenced his
operations in repairing the Northern Section of that road.
In reply to the second I have to inform you that in settling the the
accounts of the expenditures on the Pensacola and St Augustine
Road, there is a balance of about $554 which may be added to the
appropriation for the bridge. In relation to that work you will
observe the instructions contained in my letter of the 26" of last
March,” not to commence until the right of Way be secured without
expense to the public—If individuals choose to surrender that right
to the public, or if the corporation or County Authorities obtain it
and duly authorize you to proceed, you may commence the work
either by Contract, or by the labor of the troops, provided you can
obtain a sufficient number in the latter case you may consider yourself
authorized to employ master mechanics, and others if necessary, to
aid the troops, but you must distinctly understand that the whole
expense of the bridge, causeways, and the continuing the Pensacola

There is about 2000 Bushels of Coal, laying on the Beach, above high

Bushels each, as might be required for Ballast, or vessels bound to the

Scantling going to decay fast, this will always sell well to the Inhabi-
tants, for the purposes of building Houses wharfs, &C.. I did not
think it prudent to dispose of any of the above mentioned property, on
several Accounts; first, that my orders did not warrant such a respon-
sibility, and secondly that I confidently beleive that most of the
property may be disposed of at a much more advantageous rate to the
U. States, if sold at such times as there may be a demand for it.—
I would recommend Mr. Pinkney, the Collector, and a Mr. Brown,

There are many greivances complained of at Key West.—The
Inhabitants are extremely annoyed, and the further Settlement
prevented, by the pretensions of “P. C. Greene & Co.” who claims to
be with his partners sole owners of the whole Island, and entitled to
monopolize its Commerce.—By virtue of his pretended title, he has
prohibited and prevented, the erection of Buildings, he has prevented
the Inhabitants, from keeping Stock at large on the Island, for their
Comfort and conveniance, from building wharfs, or landing Goods on
the Beach, without paying wharfage.—
I understand several Merchants, at the Havanna, have expressed a
wish to transfer their Capital to Key West, but are prevented by the
uncertainty of titles to lots, and from the Apprehension of difficulties
to be thrown in their way by the Firm of Green, who refuses to sell his
pretended Claim.—
This Statement of Greivances is drawn from such information, as
was offered me, by Mr. Pinkney and others at the Island; and I
regret to say that I beleive, many of the evils complained of do really
exist.”—

TO HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN Q ADAMS,
SIR, As an officer of the government, and a member of the Bar, I take
the liberty of laying before you a grievance, under which the people
of this Judicial District are now suffering, and against a recurrence
of which I believe you possess the power to relieve them.
The hon. Henry M. Brackenridge, who fills the office of Judge of
the Superior Court, for the District of West Florida, left here in
November 1826; remained absent during the whole of the winter, &
* Gen. Scott was directed on Dec. 1, 1827, to modify the orders of the Western
Department so as not to require too frequent relief of the detachments working
on the road (NA, WD, AGO Lets. Sent, Bk. 8). Scott had assumed command
of the Western Department at Cincinnati on Nov. 1, 1827, exchanging posts
with Major General Gaines. See Galt to Clinch, Dec. 24, 1827 (NA, WD, West.
Dept., Lets. Sent, Bk. 4), ordering the detachment of the 4th Infantry, then em-
ployed in road cutting, to remain until completion of the road, or until further
orders. See also Clark to the Quartermaster General, Dec. 31, 1827 (NA, WD,
QMG Consolidated Corr. File), reporting his arrival at Cant. Brooke, and ad-
vising that Gen. Scott had countermanded his order relieving troops on the road;
and the Secretary of War to White, Dec. 29, 1827 (NA, WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil.
Bk. 12), acknowledging a letter of Dec. 25 (not found) and advising that no
change was contemplated for the present relative to the disposition of the Florida
troops.

wrote to the clerk of his court, that he would not be present to hold
his term in May last. In consequence of this no witnesses were
summoned, and no preparations were made for the trial of the causes
then upon the Docket, (amounting to fifty one in number). Hence,
(and owing, in some measure, to the additional fact that the laws of
the last Legislative Council of our Territory had not yet been pub-
lished) there was no business done at the May Term of the Court.
It is due to Judge B. to say, that the only ostensible ground for the
motion, made at that Term, to continue all the causes was our desti-
tution of the late laws. He arrived, however, not until the day before
the time appointed by Law for the opening of the Court and it is
easy to conceive into what inextricable confusion the business of the
court would have been thrown, and what manifest injustice must
have been done to many of the suitors, by his proceeding to try the
causes on the Docket, even had we been in possession of the Laws
Before Judge Brackenridge had been three months in the Territory,
he again left the District and only returned to it to hold a court
in a County 150 miles distant from this place.
The time for holding his court in November is now past, and it is
convenient for him to be again absent. Thus we are left almost
entirely without the administration of the Laws, for although our
County Courts have in many respects concurrent jurisdiction with
the Superior Courts, yet in consequence of the fluctuations & frequent
changes which our County Court system has, from time to time
undergone, almost the whole business of the Territoy has accumulated
in the Superior Courts
Among the most prominent evils, arising out of the absence of
Judge B. are the following
1* Persons charged with capital offences against the United States,
lyeing in prison long after they should have been tried
2" Wessels coming into port with slaves on board and no manifest
according to the act of Congress of 1807,” and the impossibility of
getting an order of seizure
3" Officers in the service of the United States, bound in special
bail to appear at Court, and yet liable at any hour to be ordered
* Approved Mar. 2. 1807 (2 STAT. 426–430), prohibiting the importation of
slaves after Jan. 1, 1808. Cf. post, p. 956.

away, and to be thereby subjected to the ruinous necessity of paying
the amount in which they are bound.
4* A disposition on the part of such as have become special bail,
to surrender their principals to prison, -dispairing of relief in any
other way
5* A general suspension of the criminal laws of the Territory.
It is true that Judge Brackenridge by way of excuse for his late
purposed departure from the Territory wrote word here in September
that he was not coming on in November because it was sickly in
Pensacola and this though he had been already informed that the
disease had abated and was disappearing entirely. Judge B. has
been long enough in the southern country to know that in November
there is very seldom the least danger from fever in this climate He
knew, also, or ought to have known, that the 7" sec. of the Act of
Congress of 1823, authorised him, in case this place should be visited
by malignant fever, to adjourn his court to any other time or place;”
but the event proved that more than a month before the time
appointed for holding the Court the fever had entirely disappeared.
Should Judge B's stay abroad now continue as long as his friends
expect he will have been absent from the scene of his duties fifteen
months in a year and a half.
I have given him notice of my intention to forward to you the
foregoing statement against him.”

SIR, Advices from the Deputies engaged in laying down the private
claims in the west, induce a belief that they will Soon Complete their
labours, and I regret to Say that they will not even Save themselves
under their Contracts.
I have informed them that I am Authorised to extend their Con-
tracts, as Some remuneration for the difficulties encountered, and shall
in pursuance of Your instructions proceed to have executed the Sur-
veys intimated in a former Communication *
The receipt of Your last instructions * will enable me to make my
returns to your Office in a manner I hope entirely Satisfactory.
From a Careful examination of the law of the last Session of Congress
relating to private Claims "I am not able to recommend any addi-
tional provisions that would have a Salutary effect: unless it can be
amended So as to give an additional Compensation to the Surveyor,
which from experience proves inadequate to the duties.
The additional labours imposed upon my Office without any Com-
pensation attached thereto, Must be Submitted to, under a hope that
time will be allotted for their execution Corresponding with the duties
to be performed. To induce private Claimants to give the necessary
information to the Surveyors, it will only be necessary I apprehend to
give timely notice informing them that when they fail to attend or
furnish the necessary evidence, that the lands will be Connected and
Surveyed as public lands for Sale.

SIR, There is no law which authorizes the selling of pamphlets for
postage. Agreeably to the 2" article of instructions XVIII you should
have notified the publisher of the death of Dr. Cosby on the receipt
of the first number of the Recorder after his death; then it would
have rested with him whether to have directed its return or otherwise.
The sending of accounts with newspapers as authorized in the 13"
Sect" of the post Office law, has no reference to pamphlets;* yet as
publishers of pamphlets have generally conceived the priviledge as
extending to them, it has never been the practice of the Department
to enforce any penalty with out notifying them of their error and
cautioning them against a persistence in it. The exact form pre-
scribed in that section is seldom observed by editors, yet where there
is no evident intention of violating the law, and when no injury is

The undersigned, inhabitants of S’ Augustine, Matanzas and

ment, that the funds which it has so liberally appropriated for the
repairing of roads and opening of Canals through the Territory,
should be applied, as far as practicable, to purposes of immediate

communication, sufficient for every present purpose,—that therefore
the sum necessary for the completion of this route, might more
advantageously be employed, in effecting a communication between
the Matanzas and Hallifax rivers, which streams approach, at their
sources, to within seven or eight miles of each other, and run through
a well peopled and extensively cultivated district, where such a work
would be of incalculable and permanent public benifit.—It is esti-
mated that after completing the road from the Georgia line to Tomoka,
there will be a surplus sufficient for carrying into effect the improve-
ment here recommended, so that no additional appropriation for the
purpose will be necessary.—This would at once lay open the rich
sugar lands of the South to the benifits of navigation, while the
Planters in that quarter would be enabled to Ship their produce
with more safety through the Port of S." Augustine, where there is
a lighthouse and Pilots, and where the bar is deeper than that of
Musquito, which forms at present the only passage by which they
can transport their corolps to market.—S" Augustine, the Capital
of this Section of the Territory, would be greatly benifited by such
a canal, as it would thus be made the depot for the produce of all the
regions lying to the South of it and would be supplied with provisions
of all kinds at a cheap rate & by a direct and easy channel of communi-
cation. There is another consideration that may be deemed worthy
of attention by your Honorable body, that this work would tend to
give access and an enhanced value, to the public lands in this quarter,
where the soil is adapted to the cultivation of the best staples of the
South, and where there exist large bodies of Live oak suited to the
purposes of naval ship building.—
The obvious expediency of the measure, and the presence of their
able Delegate, who can supply whatever further information may be
wanted on the subject render it unnecessary for the undersigned, to
enlarge upon these topics, or to tresspass any longer on the atten-
tion of your Honorable body.—They therefore subscribe themselves
with due respect.

That the said sixteenth Section is the only place suitable for said
location on account of water, prospects of health & general conveni-

That other situations which would be suitable are so remote from
the centre that the inhabitants cannot agree to a location upon any
of them, & that every effort which has been made for two years past
to effect a location has failed—
That a location upon the aforesaid sixteenth Section will meet with

Col° Humphreys bill, of 750$, for Salary, for the last two quarters of

doubtless make such remittance out of the sum paid to him as he may
esteem proper. My letter of 20" March, already referr'd to, will
explain why the sum paid is so small.
You will inform Col° Humphrey's that no future payment will be
made on his bills if drawn direct on the Department. His accounts
must pass through, and be adjusted, and reported by the Superin-
tendent. I have in the present case deviated from this rule, fearing
it might injure him to return the bill.

But it is esteemed proper that no purchases be made either directly or

forced to receive on board a part of the slaves and the crew (60 or 70
in number all armed) of the Guineaman, who immediately made all
sail for the Coast of Cuba where they landed the Slaves. The ves-
sels were given up to the American Captains and The Florida has
just returned. The balance of the Slaves 121 in number were put on
board the Sloop Surprize of this Port who has brought them here &
delivered a manifest of them. I have thought it my duty to seize
them and now hold them subject to the disposition of the President.
I have placed them in charge of the Deputy Marshal here, and it is
proper that clothing should be provided for them as they are nearly
naked & liable to perish with cold. I have directed the Deputy
Marshal to purchase provisions & sufficient blankets to protect them
from the cold. I have notified the District Attorney of the circum-
stance, and will be glad to have the pleasure of the President con-
municated to me: The case is a novel one, and I trust that the measures
I have taken may meet your approbation.
I beg leave to remark that the interests of the United States ab-
solutely require the establishment of a Court at this Island having
admiralty jurisdiction.” & I am convinced that a cutter placed under
the immediate control of the Collector would be attended with the
most beneficial results. Under the present arrangement not the
least service has or ever will be performed by either of the Cutters
Marion or Florida which latter vessel has not been in this Port since
10. October, & Capt. Doane with his usual disregard of his instruc-
tions sailed from hence the 7" instant for S*Mary's. The interests
of the United States on this coast have always been in great measure
dependent upon this office, & I never can expect to receive any aid
from the Cutters under the present arrangement.
I therefore respectfully request that the Cutter Florida may be
placed under my direction and paid off in this Port, where she can
always get a crew or ship them in Havana. I assure the Depart-
ment that this measure should it meet your approbation will be of
much importance in guarding the Revenue of the U. States.

SIR, The establishment of a Mail Route from Pensacola to Mobile,
renders the road you recommended last year a matter of much greater
interest to us than it was before—The transportation of the Mail
from the latter place to New Orleans has increased the facilities for
travelling so far that all the Western part of Florida would go that
way if the road was opened—I hope you have not abandoned the
idea of having it opened without a special law—If so, I will endeavor
to have one passed—as it would have the appearance of a great deal
of legislation for Florida, & as the object is so small I would much
prefer that you would order it to be done out of the Contingencies of
your Department—I received a letter from Capt Burch by the last
mail strongly urging the measure"—
I have received from several persons in Pensacola a Complaint that
a Block house on the public square is used for a Powder house—It
is represented that none of the U States stores are in it, but those of
the Corporation placed there by permission of some of your officers—
They express a wish that you will give an order for its (the house)

THE HON: HENY CLAY. Sec. State, U. S.
SIR—I hasten to reply to the charges of M" Wright,” the District
Attorney at Pensacola, which I assue you, have filled me with aston-
ishment; and I trust, the President will see from the explanations,
I am about to make, that they are unfounded and malicious.
It is true that I took advantage of the vacation, after the Novem-
ber Term 1826, to proceed to the city of Washington, where I had
business, and thence came to this city, on an occasion, which deli-
cacy forbids me to explain, but which, would be felt by the coldest

heart. The charge of M" Wright, presupposes, that it was a neglect
of duty to be absent from Pensacola; if I were Mayor of the city,
or Judge of the County Court, there might be some justice in the
complaint; but as a territorial Judge, I had duties to perform, out of
that city, and out of the district, which would have required me at
any rate, to have left Pensacola after the court; and the discharge
of those duties, or my own convenience, might have induced me to
remain in some other part of the district, two hundred miles from
Pensacola, or at Tallahasse, until the next term, that is, durg the
whole period of the vacation.
Having held the court for Judge Woodward the year before, and
transacted other business appertaining to his Office, to enable him,
to go to Michigan to settle his affars, I had a right to expect, that he
would in return perform similar services for me, under the law of the
territory approved by Congress, authorsg the Judge of the adjoining
district, to act in the place of the absent judge. Being informed,
however, that I could not depend upon his going to Pensacola, I
determined to make evey exertion to reach that place in time, and had
the good fortune to succeed. But I have no recollection of having
written to the Clerk, that I would not be at Pensacola, much less
that there would be no court, for I was certain that it would either
be held by Judge Woodward or by myself, nor was any one authorised
to give currency to such an idea, and I beleve no such idea ever did
prevail. On the contray, the Marshall was directed by me, to summon
Grand and Petit juries, which was done, and they attended. Nor do
I beleve that any one neglected summoning witnesses, or preparing
himself, under the belief there would be no court. It will be per-
ceived that the charges of M" Wright, are founded upon the evils
which might have occurd by my not holding the court, not upon
what actually did occur. On my arrival, from a supposition that
some inconvenience might be occasioned by my coming unexpectedly
to some, I adjourned the court for a week, to enable evey one to
prepare. At the end of that week, it was again opened, and I do
aver that there was not a syllable of complaint for want of preparation,
or of any confusion or inconvenience, occasioned by my absence, as is
represented by M. Wright, nor was there the slightest ground for it.
Every Case the cousel were ready to try, I was disposed to hear, and
all the cases in equity, admiralty, as well as indictmets, one of these
a capital case, were disposed of. The cases on the civil docket were
continued by their express consent, for the reason, that the law
changing the mode of proceeding in civil cases had not been promul-
gated; and that this was the only reason assigned, or which could
have been assigned. M. Wright with that inconsistency, which is

F L OR I D A T E R R I TOR Y 961
peculiar to such minds, admits that these cases would have been
continued, but that even if they had not been continued, such was
the confusion occasioned by my absence, that they could not have
been tried; here is a complaint founded on supposition, when in point
of fact, it admits there was no ground for it. I ought not to be
condemned for the evils which I might have occasioned, but for those
which my conduct actually occasioned. I appeal to you, Sir, whether
there is any candor, or justice, in this kind of accusation. The
business of Pensacola, being almost exclusively confined to the city,
for there is little or no population in the country, a few hours, would
at any time have been sufficnt to collect parties and witnesses. I do
aver that no such confusion as M. Wright speaks of, did occur, or
was likely to occur. It is true, ther was confusion, but it was confined
to Mr Wright himself, who had been endeavouring to injure me in my
absence, and was disappointed in an opprtunty of preferring charges
against me, which he had threatened. The motive of my absence at
the time, was considered an ample excuse by every one but himself,
and would have been, even if I had not arrived to hold the court.
The second charge, is, if possible, still more uncandid, and malicious.
Mr Wright states, that I had scarcely been three months in the ter-
ritory, until I again left the district, and only returned to it, to hold a
court 150 miles from Pensacola. Now, it is true, that my duties
called me to the interior, and if they had not, the yellow fever would
have driven me from Pensacola, as well as M." Wright himself. But
the truth is, that instead of travelling across the Country, threugh
through the burning sun of July, I preferred going by water sea, and
landed at S* Marks, whence I proceeded to Tallahasse and Chipola,
where I did not find the district attorney, having about that time
taken a trip to Louisville in Kentucky; but whether he had returned
or not I am unable to say; nor was it of any importance, as his place
was filled by a young gentleman of amiable manners, and promising
talents, M. Baltzel. To bring this charge to bear upon me, it was
necessary for M" Wright to shew that it was my duty to reside in the
district, whereas the act of Congress only requires a residence in the
territory, having duties to perform out of the district, of as much
importance as those within it. To shew that I have not only been
anxious to discharge my duties, but also willing to oblige others, by
performing these duties, when I thoght it might render them a service,
I take the libety of enclosing a letter from Judge Randal," for your
persusal.
As to the last accusation, I trust my explanation will be equally
Satisfactory. Shortly before the yellow fever had declared itself in

Pensacola, my wife and myself, had both been very ill; she had been
at the point of death, but about the time she became convalescent,
a packet vessel fortunately put into Pensacola, and considring it
indespensible that she should go to a Northern climate for her recovery,
I placed her on board, among strangers; and nothing but an anxiety
not to be found wanting in my Official duties, prevented me from
accompanying her. Late in the fall, I learned at Tallehasse, that she
was dangerously ill, and from feelings which I trust, no man who wears
a heart would consider criminal, although M. Wright, in the narrow-
ness of his soul, calls it consulting my convenience, I set off from
Tallehasse, to undertake the arduous journey through the whole of
the Southern States, but was unfortunately detained by a violent
attack of bilious fever in Georgia, which prevented me from reaching
this place, in time to take passage in the Schooner Orleans, Capt
Munro as I should have done; the vessel havig sailed shortly before
my arrival—But had I been so fortunate as to have reached the South,
my duties would not have called me to Pensacola, and I should have
been absent from it, during the whole vacation, and as it is, I shall
probably be at Pensacola, some months sooner than if I had never
left the territory.
As to my being absent at the November term, it is not true, that
I was informed that the sickness had subsided at Pensacola; I had
every reason to believe the contrary, and from my experence in the
climate, which has been four times that of M" Wright, I am well
satisfied, that it is never safe to venture where it has been, until after
frost. But this was not the only reason assigned by me; M' Wright
well knew, that the Marshall was dead, and that he had left no deputy,
at Pensacola, there could be no jury summoned twenty days before
the court, therefore no buisiness could have been done, even if I
had been there. Indeed, it was owing to this circumstance, that I
was induced to seize an opportunity of fulfilling one of the most sacred
of private duties, when I thought it would be least detrimental to the
publick service. And here, may I be permitted to remark, that this
is the second time I have ever been absent from the territory during
seven years; that in the discharge of my official duties, I never lost a
term of any Court, where it was in my power to attend it; that I have
performed an annual circut of one thousand miles, travellng at all
seasons, in the rains of winter, and under the burng heat of summer,
through a coutry almost a wilderness, with wretched accommodations,
and often none at all; but not with impunity, my health has often
suffered, in fact, I have not escaped a single summer, and twice, (in
1822, and 1825,) I narrowly escaped death—For the truth of this, I
confidently appeal to our delegate in Congress M* White—to whom I



## p. 963 (#991) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 963
most respectfully request, the charges exhibited by M Wright,
together with my defence may be presented, that he may state his
knowledge on the subject.
It is true, that the act of Congress makes it optional with the judge
in case of yellow fever, to adjourn the court to some futue day. But
no act of Congress can create ubiquity, and it might be necessary for
me to be absent during the whole vacation in some other part of the
teritory. As to the specifications of the district attorney, they are
either of imaginary evils, which have had no existence, or they are of
such a nature, as would occur even if I had not lef the teritory; they
are entirely local, and my duties at this vey time, would have com-
pelled me to be absent. I cannot, however, refrain from expressing
my indignation, and disgust at the singular disregard to truth, in the
ascertion, that I have ben absent fifteen months, out of a year and
a half!
I trust, that from these explanations the President will be satisfied,
that the accusations of M" Wright, have their origin in private malice.
I have long marked this young man's malignity towards me, but I
have most sedulously endeavoured by kind and conciliatory treat-
ment, to overcome his animosity. It is a most painful circumstance,
to be continually exposed to insult from a narrow minded, conceited
subordinate officer, of stinted intellect. The Judiciary of the terri-
tory, is in fact the government of the terrtry, and unless its parts
move harmoniously, the publick, as well as the private interest, must
suffer. The charges, the occasion, one, on which no man of the most
ordinary feeling, would ever bring forward even a well grounded ac-
cusation, the destitution of truth and candor on the face of them, the
want of good sense which they evince, leave no doubt of the weakness,
and wickedness of the accuser. Under a solemn sense of duty to
myself, and of a like duty to the Judiciary of the territory, I most
respectfully, but most earnestly, request, the dismissal of M Wright,
from the office of district attorney. During six years, I have dis-
charged my duties with unremitted attention, duties of great impor-
tance and various, for a salary which evey one admits to be moderate,
and that there is no ground of complaint against me, in relation to
the manner in which they have been discharged, is clearly proved by
this very accusation, for if there were, one actuated by so much malice,
could not fail to lay hold of them. An independent and upright
discharge of the office of territorial Judge, in a state of society new,
and composed of various materiels, must necessarily expose him to
much enmity, and in proportion to the difficulty of his situation,
ought to be the support of the governmet. But when a person who
holds a small office from that governmet, can presume to treat a judge
with indignity, endeavour to excite senseless clamor, against him, to

necessary to give a salutary lesson, that may serve as a warning to

HON. JOSEPH M WHITE
SIR I hope you will excuse me for calling your attention from your
important trusts, and diverting it for one moment to the condition of
our main Road from St Augustine, to Tallahassee. This road, you
will recollect, was only partially constructed, the funds appropriated
by Congress, for the purpose of compleating it, having either been
insufficient, or improvidently expended by the Commission who had
them charge; and such is its actual condition, at this moment, that
it is impassable for wheel-carriages, and the communication which it
was intended to produce, from the East to the West of Florida by a
Main High Way, is, in this condition of the road, far from being
attained.
The expense necessary to complete this road might be heavy, were
it not for the circumstance, and it is for this reason that I now invite
your attention—that the troops of the United States might be judici-
ously employed in the promotion of this object; as those stationed in
Florida are now concentrated and employed, in completeing the high-
way from the North to the South of the Peninsula; and on their return
Westwardly, from this operation, the completion of the road West-

wardly to Tallahassee, would be a work convenient for them, and in
their way.
Notwithstanding this assistance however, to be derived from the
troops, expenses could not be altogether avoided; and from communi-
cations I have had on this subject I am induced to beleive, that a
fund of Eight Thousand Dollars would be absolutely necessary, in
conjunction with this auxilliary, to open and complete the main road
in question. And considering its importance, not only to the Terri-
tory, but to the Sinews of the United States, and the advantages of it
with which you are intimate and capable of representing; I hope you
will excuse me for asking your attention to it, and joining our fellow

RESOLUTION OF THE TERRITORIAL LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
[NA: HF, 20 Cong., 1 sess.: DS *]
[December 28, 1827]
Resolved, That the Delegate in Congress from the territory of
Florida, be, and he is hereby respectfully requested, to use all proper
exertions to procure the passage of a law, authorising the Sale of the
lands reserved in this territory for the establishment of a Seminary
of learning, and for the use of Schools; at Such times, and under such
regulations, as the Governor and Council may by law direct.
In urging this request, a second time, upon the Consideration of
Congress; the members of this Council disclaim all intention of mani-
festing a feeling of discontent, as respects the Course heretofore
pursued by that Honorable body, towards this territory: On the
Contrary, they have much reason to felicitate themselves on the
munificence which it has ever seemed disposed to exercise, and do
most sincerely appreciate the liberality with which their petitions
have been regarded; but while they deny all intention, or even right
to Complain, they nevertheless consider themselves entitled to the
privelege of presenting, at all times to the Consideration of Congress,
such alterations in their Systems and laws, as will, in their opinion,
Conduce to the general advantage of the Community, which they
represent. The subject proposed in the foregoing resolution, is one
so important to the interests of Florida, and so vitally Connected
with the growth and prosperity of the institutions, which it has
manifestly been the object of that honorable body to encourage and
support, that the members of this Council Cannot believe that an
apology will be Considered necessary, for presenting it a second time;
indeed, they would Consider it an aberration from that strict line of
duty, which their obligations to the territory, and to the Government
of the United States impose, were they not again to present this
matter to the Consideration of Congress, and to submit a few of the
most prominent reasons, upon which they have predicated their
opinions.
Congress, at its last session, passed a Law granting to the Governor
and Legislative Council of this territory, the power to take possession
of the lands, which are the subject of this resolution, and to lease the
same from year to year, and appropriate the money arising trom such
leases, to the use of schools, and the erection of a Seminary of learning.”

necessarily incurred, in placing them in this train of ruin and de-
struction.
An additional reason, not indeed directly Connected with the
funds to be raised from these lands, has also had its influence with
the members of this body, in inducing them to present this request,
to the Congress of the United States. The territory of Florida is
known to possess an extent of maritime frontier, surpassing in expo-
sure any other portion of the union; it is also known to embrace an
immense tract of Country, the most of which is of such sterility, as
to present an insuperable barrier to settlement, and that its means of
defence in times of invasion, must of necessity be less, than its situation
requires. It would therefore seem, that every effort should be re-
sorted to by the government, to invite within its borders, a permanent
population, which would be identified with it in interest, and would
be disposed to defend it against foreign assailants; but if the school
lands, located as they are, in the best sections of the country, should
be kept under a lease, this desirable object would be wholly defeated.
Persons who depend upon renting lands for a support, are generally
of an unstable and itinerant Character, and having no permanent
interest in the government, would be indisposed to promote it in
peace, or defend it in war.
As the resolution herewith submitted, is only intended to request
the passage of a law, authorising the sale of these lands, at such times,
and under such regulations, as the Governor and Legislative Council
may direct, it would appear unnecessary to suggest at this time, any
mode for their future disposition; but as the success of this application
may in some degree depend upon the Correctness of their views on
this subject, the members of this body believe, that a full development
of them, will not be Considered irrelevant.
Into some parts of this territory, a tide of emigration is at this time
most rapidly flowing, and not a doubt is entertained but it will Con-
tinue to flow, as long as lands susceptible of profitable tillage, can be
procured: and when all the good lands of those sections of Country
are settled, emigrants will be directed to other parts of the territory,
which have not as yet attracted their attention. To dispose of the
school lands, therefore, upon the most advantageous terms, it is neces-
sary that the Governor and Council be at liberty, to bring them into
market, at such times as they will be in the greatest demand, from the
influx of population, to the particular section of Country, in which
they are situated. It is also Considered, that the most advisable
plan to dispose of them, will be to sell them upon a Credit of, from one
to ten years: the principal to be secured by personal security and a
lien upon the land, and to bear a reasonable interest from the sale,


## p. 972 (#1000) ###########################################

972 T E R R I TOR I. A. L. PA P E R S
to be paid annually, to the Commissioners or Trustees of the School
fund. By an adoption of this Course, it is believed the lands will sell
for a price, greater than they would Command at any future period,
and would yield an annual revenue in interest, infinitely larger than
Could ever be realized from rents.
The members of the Council are well aware of the objections which
exist to a sale of lands upon credit, but they are Convinced, that little
reflection is required to shew that those objections Cannot apply to
the school lands in this territory; the quantity to be brought into
market at any one time, will be too small to invite foreign speculation;
they will therefore be purchased by persons settling in the Country,
and the payment will be amply secured. Instead of their being ruined
in the hands of tenants, by an improvident system of Culture, they
will more likely be improved by owners, who will be looking to future
benefits and advantages, and if from non-payment, they should, at
any time, revert to the government, they will return with an increased
value.
With regard to the fund to be raised from a sale of these lands, the
members of the Council would only observe, that when Collected, it
might be securely and advantageously vested in some stock, which
would give an annual income, amply sufficient to carry into effect,
the beneficent designs of Congress, in setting them apart.
In Conclusion, the members of the Council would respectfully re-
mark, that if rules have been established by Congress, in relation to
the disposition of the lands reserved for Universities and the support
of schools, which are adverse to the request they now make; they
can but hope, that the reasons here assigned, added to the peculiar
situation of the Country in which they live, will be Considered as afford-
ing sufficient grounds for a departure from those rules, so far as the
territory of Florida is Concerned.—

which were urged at that time, with an increased force, arising from

MY DEAR SIR I presume by this time you have arrived at the

you to bear in mind (if you can possibly spare time from the mul-

section of the Country who holds you in high esteem & regard, and
who will be always gratified if you will give him some evidence of its
reciprocity, by occasionally informing him how you & yours are and
how they get on in the great world"—
On my last cruise I learned something of the character & settlement
at Key West and as the representative of this territory I give it you,
not confident however you will derive any original information from
it but with the belief at least it might be useful—
You are aware that a person, named P. C. Green & his Copartners
claim to be sole owners of the island and with this claim pretended or
real, assume a monoply of the commerce, & therefore prohibit &
prevent the erection of any buildings, either houses or wharves &
exact wharfage for goods landed on the beach, nor will he or they
permit cattle to run at large on the island although there are I learn

near 250 inhabitants who require whe require something of the kind
whe aettially reqtt for their comfort & better subsistence.
I have understood also there are several Merchants at Havanna
who have expressed a wish to transfer their Capital to Key West,
but are prevented from the uncertainty to titles to property & from
apprehension of difficulties being thrown in their way by the firm of
Green, who will not dispose of their pretended claims. I believe
there is not a doubt if a certainty to titles could be made apparent,
there would be an increase of population, & a valuable improvement
in buildings & cultivation. I understand M. Green has proved the
island is capable of producing in abundance all the fruits of the
tropical climates—
You are also aware there are no civil magistrates on the island,
hence the Lex talionis" is the law of the land by common consent.
You are also aware there is not on the island an admiralty Judge,
of the imperious necessity for one I have no doubt you will coincide
with me, when I assure you I have been informed & I believe the
wrecks that occur on or near the island & that are brot in to Key
West average one every week in the year, the amount of the property
of these wrecked vessels is immense, Most of the wrecked vessels
are foreign & bound from Jamaica & Cuba & Gulph of Mexico to
Europe and as a portion of the proceeds of their cargoes go into the
treasury of the gen" gov" as revenue the necessity of an Admiralty
Judge is very obvious—the Custom now is to choose two disinterested
Men as Arbitrators who decide the question of salvage the wreckers
are entitled to, where there are conflicting interests such a mode must
naturally be offensive to one of the parties, the several days of bad
navigation to St Augustine together with the small draft of water on
that bar, makes it impossible to carry the vessels & goods rased to
this port hence Key West is the port they must resort to. the sal-
ubrity of the island is as good if not better than any in the West
Indies of Gulph of Mexico, there was a stagnant pool in the rear of
the town at the time our squadron under Porter rendezvoued then &
there together with the very great & useless exposure of the officers &
men & total want of system I have not a doubt were the causes that
led to so many deaths, but since whieh a canal has been made so as

to admit the ebb & flood of the sea into the pool the place has been
entirely free from sickness & as a very good evidence of the fact Porter
lay nearly a year at one time at that anchorage since he has been in
the Mexican service without being at all effected by the diseases
incidental to all tropical climates. Under all these impressions then
I am convinced that with a little law & a good deal of justice & the
land claims perfectly & immediately adjusted, this little island will
become of much importance to the nation,
If I were with you I could point out to you on the chart where a
change in the rout of our vessels bound from the northern ports to the
Gulph of Mexico, will soon take place, I mean vessels drawing not
more than 13 feet water, by casting your eye over the chart of that
part of the Gulph near Cape Florida, you will observe vessels drawing
any water may go inside the bar & navigate inside to Key West in
not less than 5 fathoms, thence they can proceed by Key West to the
Northw" carrying 13 feet into the Gulph of Mexico shortening the
distance 150 miles and avoiding the dangerous & treacherous naviga-
tion around the Tortugas.—I must not omit (as I have carried you
so far into my prosing letter & perhaps told you every thing you knew
before) to apprise you of one other fact of which I know you are
ignorant & that is the rise of property at Key West, I last month
leased by the year some houses belonging to the U.S. and that which
only produced $180. p. annum rents this year $1760—one house
alone & that about the size of a man of war's Cabin, rented for $1082–
last year it rented for $80—these facts speak for themselves.
As you must be sick & tired & as I am a little of the latter myself I
will close with many sincere wishes of health & happiness for you &
yours.

master, and Date of First Return. The names of the bondsmen are written in red ink above the names of the postmasters. The dates
of the first returns in these books are the nearest that can be found to the establishment dates. Given in the books, but not listed

* Robert Mitchell was not the first postmaster at Pensacola. The Pensacola Floridian, of Aug. 18, 1821, contains a notice of the
establishment of a post office at that place and of a regular weekly mail to Claiborne, Ala., the point of intersection with the eastern,
northern, and southern mails. In the same newspaper appear a number of lists of letters remaining in the post office at Pensacola, ad-
vertised by the post master, Cary Nicholas, who was also one of the publishers of the newspaper. These lists appear in the issues of
Oct. 8, 1821, Jan. 7, Apr. 13, July 27, 1822, and Mar. 8, 1823, over the name of Cary Nicholas, and others in the issues of Apr. 19,
July 5, and Oct. 25, 1823 over the name of Robert Mitchell. The lists were usually advertised quarterly and appeared in several suc-
ceeding numbers of the newspaper. Similar lists were published in the Pensacola Gazette and West Florida Advertiser during 1824–1828.
*The St. Augustine East Florida Herald, of Feb. 7, 1824, contains the information that the mail had commenced running between
that place and Jefferson, Ga., in the previous week through Jacksonville, where John L. Doggett had been appointed postmaster and
would immediately open a post office.
* Lists of letters remaining at the post office at St. Augustine, advertised by the postmasters, are to be found in the following issues
of the St. Augustine East Florida Herald: Apr. 5, July 19, and Oct. 18, 1823; Nov. 20, 1824; Jan. 25, 1825; Apr. 4, July 4, and Oct. 3,

RESOLUTION BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[NA:SF, 20 Cong. 1 sess:DS *]
|January 1, 1828]
Resolved, That the Delegate in Congress from the Territory, be
requested to use his exertions to obtain the passage of a Law in that
body, providing for the gradation of public lands in Florida according
to their relative value; for instance, all lands that shall remain in
market one, year, can be entered at one dollar per Acre, two years,
seventy five cents, three years, fifty cents, four years twenty five
cents, and after five years at the price of surveying such land with
interest.”
In submitting this request and plan of gradation, to the considera-
tion of Congress, the Legislative Council are not insensible of the
liberality heretofore extended to the people of Florida in the purchase
of public lands, and make their suggestions with all possible deference
and respect to the better judgment of that body, and would beg leave
to remark, that such a plan of graduation would be admirably calculated
both to guard the interest of the general government, as well as to
promote the interest of Florida, as there would be no additional
expence attending such graduation and sale, and by which too, every
one could become identified with the soil, it matters not how limitted
his means might be.
Florida is not less exposed than she is conspicuous, possessing a
Sea coast almost equal to any two States in the Union indented with
Ship harbours and inlets affording a ready access to the maratime
and naval operations of both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
Ocean, hence it is all important in order to resist the hostile arma-
ments of an enemy in time of war from possessing those points so
vitally important, not only to Florida but to the whole Southern
Country, that a dense population should be induced if possible to
settle on the extended and diversified range of poor land spotted with
small Hammocks, that constitute at least three fourths of Florida,
which never will be inhabited at the present minimum price of public
lands, but would soon present the aspect of cultivation and industry,
should a plan of this kind be adopted. In all privileges of this sort
the agriculturalist is to be exclusively benefited, forming as history
and experience has taught mankind to be the nursing mother of a

that internal improvements would suffer from a lessening of the Treasury income.

WILLIAM. H. HUNT TO THE POSTMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:C*]
Post Office, PENSACOLA 4" January 1828.—
HON: JOHN M*LEAN, P. M. Gen" Washington
SIR, Conceiving that I might obtain useful information, with
regard to the arrangement of the Mails at Mobile and Blakely, and
be enabled to arrange our mails in the manner most beneficial to our
citizens, by a visit to Mobile:—I accompanied the mail rider on
Friday last left this place at 12 O'clock, arrived at Perdido that
evening. 21. miles
from the Perdido River to Hall's there is no house— 35. “
from Hall's to Blakeley (measured)— 14. “
making from Pensacola to Blakeley— 70 Miles.
This is five miles further than it is generally estimated, but I am
confident, if it was measured, it would exceed, rather than fall short
of my estimate. The present road is in many places very circuitous
and might, with a trifling expense, undoubtedly be shortened 12 to 15
miles. Some persons think as much as 20. This is certainly very
desirable and might easily be accomplished by the Troops at this
place, if an order from the Q Master's Department to that effect
could be obtained. I am informed that the Q Master at this place
has been instructed to survey the route, and believe he has performed
that duty and reported the result, I therefore presume that the order
may be obtained by your solicitation.
I have arranged our temporary Mail to leave here at 12 O'clock
every Friday—arrive at Blakeley on Saturday night cross to Mobile
on Sunday Morning & return to Blakeley in the evening—from
whence it will immediately start on its return, and arrive here on
Tuesday at 12 O'clock. This is the best arrangement practicable, in
the present situation of the road. The Ferry Boat crosses every day
from Blakeley to Mobile and returns in the evening, which detains
the Mail nearly a whole day, & makes it impracticalbe “to go and
return in three days.” All mails meet at Mobile on Sunday morning,
that evening is therefore the best time for our mail to leave there, and

it arrives here in proper time on Tuesday, to forward any packets,
which may come in it, by the Mail, to other parts of our Territory.
It is my opinion that, without some clearing out of the present Road,
the Mail cannot be carried with convenience, in a stage, even in the
time now allowed—Still it is highly desirable that it should go in a
Stage—and if a direct road is cut, it may be transported in one, still
more speedily. This route, though not likely to be a productive one
to the Department, is one which will afford much accommodation to
the Citizens of this place and indeed of the whole Territory, in facil-
itating their correspondence with Mobile, New Orleans, and all of the
States of Louisiana and Mississippi, and it has been suggested to me
by several, both here and at Blakeley, that it would be very acceptable
if the Department would allow two Mails a Week between the two
places. Could this be done and the Steam Boat communication
between Mobile and New Orleans be permanently re-established, the
mails on the route would be increased an hundred times, and the
intercourse between the cities and States above mentioned greatly
facilitated.—
The expenses on the route, as now arranged, must be at least $14
a week to the contractor, besides the risk and wear of horses, and I
expect that competition will be such as to make bids lower than the
contractor can make anything by-unless passengers in a Stage
contribute to keep him. Should this be the case, I trust that it will
be considered, in deciding on the request to allow two mails a weeks.—
My expences on the trip were eighteen dollars & fifty cents, respect-
ing which I await an answer to my last; addressed to Mr Bradley.
Permit me to request that this letter may be shown to the Hon:
J. M. White, our Delegate in Congress; that he may communicate
to you his views of the Subject."—
Very Respectfully, your obedt Servt.

the collection of Duties on Imports and Tonnage in Florida and for
other purposes” approved the 7” May 1822,” You will perceive
that foreign goods, wares, & merchandise, cannot be imported from
any port in Florida for the benefit of drawback “unless the same
Shall have been imported directly into the Said Port from a foreign
Port or place—
We cannot See any just reason for placing the Ports in Florida
under those peculiar restrictions from which, Ports of United States
are exempted; these restrictions operate with extreme Severity against
the Ports of Pensacola and Key West, which from their local positions,
are be:ter adapted for an advantageous trade with the Island of
Cuba & the Ports of Mexico, than any other Ports within the Sover-
eignty of the United States, and they would in Our opinion enjoy a
large portion of the trade of those Countries provided these restric-
tions were removed—As the Law now Stands, goods imported into
Key West direct from a foreign Country, can be Shipped with deben-
ture, but if transhipped Coastwise from New York to Key West
this privaledge is denied:—It Cannot surely be considered advisable
in wise legislation to retain a Statute, which merely gives trouble to
the Merchant, but which can be so easily evaded; for example, goods
are shipped from New York for Bermuda, the drawback forthwith
attaches, and the debenture becomes effectual
These goods then can again be reshipped, and arriving would as
coming direct from a foreign Country be entitled to debenture, when
reexported from Key West and the Merchants in their trade to the
Islands and to the Maine would attain all the benefits they desire;—
Thus You see the Law can be most easily evaded, with this only
inconvenience, that a Shipment via Bermuda would impose some
additional trouble and expense beyond what would be incurred if
drawbacks were admitted on Shipments made Coastwise from Ports
or places in the United States—Any increased expense that can be
avoided, Should be, because every increase of it will have a tendency
to place us on terms of less fair competition with the Merchants
residing at New Providence—The advantages to be derived from this
trade is of more importance, than one who has not reflected upon
the Subject, might at first conceive—The contiguity of Key West to
Cuba and the Ports of Mexico, gives it in point of Situation a decided
Superiority over other Ports of the United States for a trade with
those Countries—

Hides, Sugar Coffee &c. and in exchange require, large and various

Supplies of Articles, which they have been in the habit of procuring
heretofore at New Providence and at Jamaica *-
So important have the British Government considered this Com-
merce, that for the last Twenty Years; free Port licences have been
extended to the Spanish traders by which they are exempt from all
and every sort of Port charges—But the proximity of Key West which
is only about eighty miles from Cuba, a distance that can always be
run in a night, induces those traders to prefer a commerce with it.
The passage is so short and so Safe, and withall every thing of risk
from Privateers and pirates being saved, they will always prefer it
while they can be Supplied with articles Suited to their purposes—
This tho, Cannot be the Case unless the prevaldge of drawback is
allowed, for at present owing to the limited State of Capital and the
facilities afforded at our home markets, importations direct from
Europe do not take place—the Consequence is, that unless Congress
grant the ef relief sought for, a great portion of the Spanish trade now
so valuable to the Commerce and Navigation of the United States,
must continue to go to the Ports of Jamaica & New Providence—
It has been urged that the arrangement Sought for be obtained
would increase the Chances to fraud on the Revinue; and that an
illicit trade from Key West to the United States might be the conse-
quence—This certainly is a far fetched Suggestion and applies in
point of probability no more to that than any other Port or place in
the Country;—The Same thing might be imputed to Shipments for
drawback from New York, Boston Pelad" or Baltimore and with
much greater Seeming plausibility; because Key West being Con-
tiguous to the Maine land in Florida where the population is few and
Scattering precludes every inducement or attempt at fraud persons
being never disposed to place property where there are none to con-
sume and purchase it;-But besides this an ample and Sufficient
answer to this objection is, that the Supposition of frauds of this
character, goes to break down the whole doctrine and System of
debenture; in as much as its feasibilities from any other Port, is just
as great as it could be from Key West-

deeming it necessary to go minutely into detail, to ehe those so famil-
iar with the Commerce and Navigation of the Country as you are:-

MORRISON AND OTHERS
[NA:SD, Misc. Lets.:C *]
KEY WEST January 5* 1828
HON. HENRY CLAY, Secretary of State,
The Memorial of the Undersigned respectfully represents, That on
or about the 20" day of December last, Your Memorialists saved His
Britanic Majesty's Schooner Nimble, together, with the persons on
board the Spanish Brig Gurrero from the Coast of Africa, laden with
Negroes, both of which were ashore on the Florida Reef—that after
the Schooner Nimble was repaired sufficiently to sail, (her Rudder
and False Keel both having been carried away) she was brought,
together with her Officers and crew, to this Port.
Your Memorialists would further state that after the arrival of the
Nimble at this place they were desirous to effect an amicable and
speedy Adjustment of the Salvage, and for this purpose proposed to
Lieut Holland, the Commanding Officer of the Schooner, to submit the
matter to arbitration, being the usual tribunal resorted to in such
cases, but Lieut Holland positively refused to have any other adjudica-
tion than that of a Court of Admiralty. Your Memorialists finding
him obstinate in his determination, and to preserve Amity, agreed to
all the propositions of Lieut Holland, and proceeded to take the

testimony in the case, (there being no Court at this place,) before a
Justice of the Peace. Your Memorialists would further state, that
when the depositions were completed, they sent them to Lieut Holland,
for his perusal, under the expectation that he would, according to
agreement, corroborate all the Statements contained in them, by his
certificate or Affidavit, and return them; but to the great astonishment
of your Memorialists, Lieut. Holland did not even look at the deposi-
tions, and in defiance of all law (there being no physical force in the
Port sufficient to detain him) made Sail, and left your Memorialists
without any compensation for their arduous toil, and expense in
saving him and his Wessel & Crew from inevitable destruction. For
the particulars of this transaction, from begining to end Your Me-
morialists respectfully call your attention to the documents herewith
transmitted."
Your Memorialists would further represent, that a p[MS. torn] of
the Negroes taken from the Wreck of the Brig, were carried to Cuba
and the residue brought to this place, and delivered over to the highest
Civil Authority on the Island, to be disposed of according to law—
that they were and still are, entirely ignorant of the mode of proceeding
prescribed by law in such cases, and that they adopted this course as
being in their opinion the correct one. They would further state,
that they have been informed and believe, that the Collector of this
Port Wm Pinkney Esq either has or intends to set up a claim against
the United States for the bounty allowed to Citizens for Capturing
of Wessels laden with Negroes from the Coast of Africa, thereby
assuming to himself the attitude of your Memorialists, and excluding
them from all benefit or emolument (if any there be) arising from the
Capture, if it may be so called.
Your Memorialists would further state, that if they have proceeded
illegally in regard to the Negroes, it is attributable only to their
ignorance of the law, regulating the subject, as will appear in the
opinion of your Memorialists to your entire satisfaction, from the
papers herewith enclosed, and to which they beg leave again to refer,
for the particulars in relation to the Negroes.
Your Memorialists would further represent that they each command
a Vessel, and pursue the Wrecking business as their sole Avocation—
that they have incurred much trouble and expense, and are compelled,

[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 1 sess.: LS]
WASHINGTON Jany 6. 1828.
HON* J. C. ISACKS Chairman of the Committee of Public Lands.
SIR. Having understood that your Committee have before them
a bill, the object of which is to grant two additional quarter sections
of land in the vicinity of Tallahassee to the Territory of Florida,"
I beg leave through you to place before the Committee, a Statement
of facts in relation to the reservations made under an act of Congress
entitled “An Act providing for the Seat of Government in the Terri-
tory of Florida, and for other purposes”, approved the 24" of May
1824.50
In accordance with the act referred to, the executive of Florida
selected the South East Quarter of Section 36 in Township One,
Range One North and West, which is now the site of Tallahassee,
and the late acting Governor George Walton, during my temporary
absence from Florida, selected three other quarter sections of land
adjoining the same, as directed by the act of Congress: a copy of

his letter to George Graham commissioner of the General Land Office,
dated Feb 16** 1825 is herewith transmitted."
The Committee will see that the whole Section authorized to be
selected in pursuance of the act aforesaid, was located long previous
to the selection and location of the Township of land granted to Gen-
eral Lafayette by the United States. None of the quarter sections
thus reserved for Florida, were claimed by any person at the time of
the location.
The whole country around the seat of the Government, up to the
date of General Lafayette's location was open and could have been
reserved from sale, with the single exception of the quarter section
on which I resided, and which could not under the Act of Congress
have been taken for the Territory, as it did not adjoin, but only
cornered on the South East extremity of the quarter section on which
Tallahassee is established.
In the month of February 1825, I visited Washington, and was
solicitous that Congress should give four other quarter sections of
land, as I understood it had been the practice to grant two sections
to the Territories, but the Session was drawing so near to its close,
as to preclude the hope that a law could be passed before the dissolu-
tion of Congress. I called on the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, and requested that four additional quarter sections might be
reserved from sale, as I hoped Congress would ultimately grant them
to the Territory, and orders to this effect, I believe, were transmitted
to the Register and Receiver of the Land Office at Tallahassee.” On
my return to Florida I found that the quarter section of land which I
had settled on and inproved in the Summer of 1824, previous to any
locations whatever, and months before a Surveyor had appeared in
Florida, was during my absence reserved from sale. This reservation
however gave the Territory no claim to the land I had settled; and
under the preemption law passed by Congress to secure to actual
settlers their improvements,” I claimed with justice the quarter
section on which I had built and resided in the year 1824.
The Honorable Mr M"Kee* of Congress selected for General
Lafayette a Township of Land adjoining Tallahassee on the East, thus
covering one of the quarter sections that had been previously located
by the acting Governor as described in his letter of the 16" of February
1825," It is believed the Township granted by Congress to General
Lafayette was not designated by his agent until April 1825."

Under the preemption law before referred to, as one of the first
actual settlers, I made application to the Register and Receiver of the
Land Office to permit me to enter the quarter section of land on which
I had resided, but under the peculiar circumstances of the case, they
thought proper to refuse the entry. My petition was presented to the
Honorable A. B. Woodward for a mandamus to compel the proper
officers to admit my right, and after a full examination of the evidence
and an elaborate argument by counsel for and against my claim, the
Court decided that I was entitled to the land, and ordered the Register
and Receiver to permit me to make my entry, as I had a right to do
under the preemption law. This was done, and all the papers in rela-
tion to my claim was transmitted to the Commissioner of the General
Land Office, and I have understood my claim has been sanctioned by
the Department.” If I am mistaken in this fact (for I cannot say
positively) it will be easy to obtain the information from the Land
Office.
It may be proper also to state that all the papers on which the Court
acted in my case were submitted by me to the Legislative Council of
Florida, at their first Session after the decision, to enable them to
prosecute the case if they believed the Territory had any claim to the
land. The Council, believing that my claim was valid and just,
refused to direct a further prosecution. Unwilling however to see the
claim of General Lafayette lessened even one quarter of a section, I
offered to surrender my land & houses to the Territory, if the Legisla-
tive Council or Congress would pay me for my improvements, so as to
enable me to build another dwelling even as rude as the Hull I now
inhabit. I flatter myself that the Committee will grant four quarter
sections of land to the Territory,” in addition to the section given by
the Act of May 1824, if it has been usual to allow so much to other
Territories, and the generosity of the Committee will never permit
them to grant less to one Territory than they have bestowed on others.
Should further information on this subject be desired, on application
to Mr Graham, it will no doubt be promptly furnished.
It may not be improper to state that but for the house I erected at
considerable expense, no other could have been obtained sufficiently
large and dry, in which the Public business could have been transacted,
and the records and papers have been safely preserved.
I solicit you, Sir, to assure the Committee that however just my
claim may prove, I would rather surrender the land and my humble
dwelling without compensation, than see the Territory deprived of one
acre of land by any act of mine. If the Committee shall consider me

SIR. In consequence of the receipt of the Report of the Register
& Rec at St Augustine relative to private claims in East Florida,” it
becomes necessary to apply for an appropriation for surveying private
claims in Florida. I therefore respectfully suggest than an appropria-
tion of 10.000 dollars for that object be applied for in addition to the
unexpended balance in the Treasury ($5000) which will it is expected
be sufficient to meet the expenses of surveying the private claims in
Florida 61

SIR I had the honor to receive a communication from you on the

Chief Blount and which was transmitted to the Secretary of war by
the Hon” J. M. White Delegate of Florida—The sub-agent John
Phagan Esq is greatly abused & misrepresented in this petition. He
is a man of correct and humane feeling, of decided character, and tried
integrety and is an excellent and faithful officer,
The conduct of the sub-agent has been enquired into by the Acting
Governor W* M M*Carty Esq and has met his decided approbation—

as his letter to me of the 18" of Decm” 1827 will shew—(herewith
transmitted).”
The letter or petition seems to have been written and witnessed by
a cirtain Stephen Richards—who was formerly the Interpreter for
the Florida Indians, but his conduct was so improper, and he was so
much in the habit of violating the law—respecting the intercourse
and trade with the Indians—that I felt it my duty to dismiss him
from the agency—This was done in accordance with the expressed
will and at the request of John Blount, (who is made to sign this
petition) and the other chiefs—
Richards is known to be destitute of character and is in fact con-
sidered as a most unprincipled man by the honest citizens who know
him—No statement he can made will be entitled to credit, unless it
is supported by respectable evidence.
Since the location of M Phagan on the Appalachicola River this
man Richards has been prohibited from trading with and cheating
and taking from the Indians their property, and I entertain no doubt
that it has been owing to this improper conduct, and deceitful influ-
ence that the chief John Blount has become so refractory. This M*
Richards has been labouring everer since Maj. Phagan, settled among
the indians to destroy his character and influence with them
It may be necessary to remove Blount down into the nation, in the
manner provided or directed by the late Treaty if he does not conform
to laws provided for the regulation of trade, and the Government of
the Indians"

house near to, and improving the navigation of the river S." Marks."
From the great increase of population in Middle Florida, her exports
will soon be considerable, and can only find their way to market
through the port of S’ Marks. It is Stated by gentlemen acquainted
with the bay of Appalachee and the river S" Marks, that vessels draw-
ing fifteen feet can approach within five miles of Fort St Marks.—
From the Devils Elbow, as it is called, to the fort, the channel at two
points is obstructed by rocks which can be easily removed. Six or
seven thousand dollars, from the best information, would effect this
desirable object.
The whole country from Little River in Gadsden county, and for
twenty miles east of the Ocilla River, a distance of Sixty Seven miles,
must depend on S' Marks as their only port.—The Ocilla River Sinks
near the Gulph of Mexico, and passes under a natural bridge of lime-
stone, which is a barrier to navigation. A Survey of this natural
bridge will demonstrate that a Small appropriation will remove the
obstruction.
The interest of that part of Georgia which is Situated north and
east of Tallahassee will be as much benifitted by the improvement in
the navigation of S’ Marks, as any part of Florida, for it is their only
outlet to the Gulph.
I trust you will be able to Satisfy the Committee who may report on
your resolutions," of the advantages which will result to the country
generally, by effecting objects So useful.
* The resolution introduced by White on Dec. 12, 1827, related to making St.
Marks a port of entry, improving the harbor there, and removing obstructions in
the Ocilla River (House Journal, 20 Cong., 1 sess., p. 43). A Senate resolution
submitted by Sen. Josiah Johnston, of Louisiana, Dec. 31, 1827, concerned the
improvement of the harbor and the erection of a lighthouse (Senate Journal, 20
Cong., 1 sess., p. 65–66). On Jan. 15, 1828, Johnston submitted another resolu-
tion concerning the establishment of a port of entry at St. Marks and the improve-
ment of the Apalachicola and Aucilla Rivers (ibid. 93).
" In accordance with the resolutions referred to in the preceding note, a report of
the Senate Committee on Commerce, Jan. 21, 1828 (NA, SF, 20 Cong., 1 sess.;
printed, S. Doc. 50, 20 Cong., 1 sess., and Pensacola Gazette and W. Fla. Advertiser,
Mar. 7, 1828), recommended a survey of St. Marks river and harbor with a view
to their improvement and favored the establishment of a lighthouse and port of
entry in the area. Filed with the MS. report are additional documents concerning
the improvement: L. and M. A. Armistead to White, Dec. 11, 1827 (printed,

extract from a report by Lt. Swift (undated), and a “Sketch of the river St. Marks,

apparently resulted from a request by Del. White to the Chief Engineer, Jan. 2,

It appears from the above statement, that one of the Quarter Sec-

Township subsequently selected for General Lafayette, and the local
authorities in Florida not being willing to interfere in any manner
with the munificent grant of Congress to that illustrious Patriot con-
sented to withdraw their claim to that Reserve, which being pre-
viously appropriated might have been held by them.” In the selec-
tions afterwards made for the same object one of them included the

of preference in the purchase of lands to settlers te Settlers prior to
the 1* Jan 1825.” Whether this dicision was correct or not the
Committee do not deem it their Province to inquire: to obviate any
difficulty however the Committee have received satisfactory informa-
tion that Governor Duval offered to the Legislative Council the
Quarter Section in question after it was adjudged to him, upon their
paying him for the improvements actually made by him.
The Territory of Florida will have by the bill now reported the
quantity usually granted in other places for this object with the ex-
ception of this Quarter which they can acquire upon such just and
reasonable terms, that if they do not accept them, the Committee
conceive no further grant ought to be made by the United States.
They do not doubt however that this claim will be arranged between
the Governor and the Territory in a way satisfactory to both without
any legislation on the Subject.
Upon the subject of the Third Section of the bill, the Committee
refer to the petition marked B and made a part of this Report."
(Insert it)"
The Laws of the United States give to each County in the Territory
the right of preemption to a Quarter Section of land,” the reasons for
a change are fully set forth in the foregoing representation:
the County will be enabled to select the Quarter they desire by a
transfer of the same quantity for the same use for which that was re-
served, whilst the interests of the inhabitants are carefully protected.
It is a question in which the United States have no direct interest:
no land is asked for, or granted: a commutation which can only be
effected by our law, is afforded for the convenience, and at the appli-
cation of a large number of inhabitants.
The Sixteenth Section of each Township, it may be necessary to
remark, is reserved for the use of Schools, one Quarter of this is to be
exchanged for another Quarter to which the County is entitled, and
the Committee do not doubt that the remaining three Quarters by the
location of the County Seat would be more valuable than the whole,
even if another was not transferred for the same object.”

The Committee on Roads and Canals, to whom were referred two
memorials from the people of East Florida,” concerning certain roads
therein, and a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 18"
of December, 1827,” instructing them to inquire into the expediency

report:
The Country between S*Augustine, on the Atlantic, and Pensacola,
on the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of four hundred miles, is so thinly
peopled, as to be wholly incompetent to improve and repair the
Military and post road connecting these points, so essential to the
protection of the Territory of Florida. They are at the extremes
of a line passing the military post called Cantonment King, deemed
essential to the security of the infant Settlements in its vicinity,
from the neighboring Indians, and that of Tampa bay, as well as
by the town of Tallahasse, the New Capital of the Territory of
Florida. The importance of the road connecting these positions, is
illustrated by the past experience of the Federal Government, in

act of Congress of 1824,” appropriating 28,000 dollars for its con-
struction. This sum, spread over a distance of four hundred miles,
then, unmarked even by a hunter's path, was indeed, inadequate
to its object. Still, however, the subjoined letters” evince that much
must have been effected by its expenditures, since a very moderate
sum is now recommended as sufficient to provide for the most essential
repairs of the road. (See letters marked A. & B.) The Committee
are assured that, before the Bill which accompanies this report and
contains an appropriation to the above object,” shall be taken up
in the House, a report will be received from the Engineer Depart-
ment,” demonstrating the practicability of completing the navigation
referred to in the first and second sections of the same bill, by the
sums, of which the Committee recommend the application to this
object.

[FSL:Fla., Terr., Legis. Council, Journal: M*]
[January 16, 1828]
RESOLVED, that our delegate in Congress be requested to use
his endeavors to have the following mail rout established in Florida,
Viz. from Pensacola to M°Caskels ferry, thence to Pitmans ferry,
thence to the Seat of Justice for Walton County on rockey river,

Seat of Justice for Jefferson County, thence to Hickstown Madison
County, thence to Micco town in Hamilton County, thence to Dills,
thence to Black creek, thence to Jacksonville thence to S*Augustine,
and from the Agency by the way of Wontons to Dills.
The reason which the Legislative Council offer for this change is
first because the present rout goes through a dreary unsettled Sec-
tion of Country missing several of the principal settlements and
seats of Justice for many of the counties in this territory. Secondly,
because it is the impression of the Legislative Council that the pro-
posed rout will be equal if not shorter than the present rout between
Pensacola and S” Augustine, and besides that it will be of eminent
advantage to the citizens of the Territory. The Legislative Council
would also recommend, the carrying of the mail from Tallahassee to
St. Marks, also the establishing of the following post offices, viz.
at Hickstown in Madison County, Micco town in hamilton county
and at Black creek in Duval county, all of which is respectfully
submitted.”

That the subject having been already anticipated by our Delegate
in Congress, they do not conceive it necessary at this time to renew
the request.—Notwithstanding, the committee are perfectly aware
of the advantages to be derived to the Territory, by the removal of
the tribes to their destination, beyond the Mississippi, and of the
injury she has sustained by their present location.
The same committee who were directed under a resolution of the
Council “to enquire into the present situation of the inhabitants of
this territory in relation to the Indian tribes within the same, and the
probable causes that have influenced said tribes not to be removed
out of the country” have the honor to report: That during the last
year, with some painful exceptions, the Indians have been confined
within their boundaries; these exceptions, it is believed, arose from
an open violation of the laws of the Territory, prohibiting them from
roaming at large. To whom this blame is to be attached, it is not
for your committee to say, but hope hereafter, more vigilance will be
used by the proper authorities, to prevent similar occurrences.
Your committee have further to state, that much complaint exists
in the country, on account of the reluctance with which runaway
slaves among the Indian tribes have been surrendered by the proper
authorities to their lawful owners. Whether this zeal to retain prop-
erty in the nation arises from an over solicitude to protect the unfor-
tunate red man, or is to be attributed to other motives, your com-
mittee have no documents before them to prove. But that there is
complaint, a reference to the numerous letters on file in the war office
at Washington will declare. Your committee further state, from
such information as common report of facts, which they believe
susceptible of legal proof, an illicit traffic is carried on and counte-
nanced among them.
The probable causes that have influenced said tribes not to be
removed, your committee conceive are to be traced to interest and
unwarrantable interference on the part of those connected with them.
It is further believed that their removal, an event intimately con-
nected with the prosperity of the territory, will not be effected, until
different sentiments are diffused among them.
Under this view, your committee recommend the adoption of the
following resolution.
RESOLVED, That a copy of this report be forwarded to our
Delegate in Congress, requesting him to submit the same to the
consideration of the proper authorities.

SIMON BERNARD TO DELEGATE WHITE
[NA:HF, 20 Cong., 1 sess.:ALS"]
[January 18, 1828]
Gen" Bernard has the honor to present his respects to M'. White,
and, in answer to his note of the 16" instant,” to submit the following
remarks and valuations.
Two water communications might be openned between S* Mary's
harbour and S" John's river: one for boats through what is called
Inland-Passage, and which, on account of the numerous, short and
narrow windings, could not admit of the passage of sloops unless
large expenditures should be made. The other should be a thorough-
cut canal from Belle-river to a branch of Nassau river, and would
form a link of the line of the contemplated inland-navigation along
the coast: the expense of its execution will be considerable.
In regard to the former, or present existing communication, the
points where the tides meet are those that require improvement.
The first obstruction is found between St Mary's and Nassau and
consists of a shallow channel, two miles in length, left dry at low
tide, and affording about three feet at high-tide. To improve this
channel to a depth of four feet at common half tide and on a width
of thirty feet, the expense would be about . . . . . . . . . . . $8.600.
The second obstruction, between Nassau and Talbot-inlet, is seven
hundred yards in length left dry at low-tide: to improve this channel
to a depth of four feet and on a width of twenty yards it would re-
quire about . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $3.300.
The third obstruction, between Talbot-inlet and the S" Johns, on a
length of four hundred yards, has but one foot water at low-tide; to
improve this place, it would take about . . . . . . . . . . . . $1.400.
The fourth and last obstruction is at the Sisters: it is a narrow bar,
which would require for its improvement about . . . . . . . . . . $340
Therefore, to render the Inland-Passage navigable, throughout, at
half-common tide, for boats drawing more than three feet six inches,
an expense amounting, at least, to $13,440 dollars will be necessary.”

EXECUTIVE OFFICE Jam 20th 1828
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
SIR. The Council having rejected my nomination of Waters Smith
Llewellen Williams, Faquier Bethune, Paul M*Cormick & Squire
Streeter, and having recommended others in the place of those I have
named, I deem it proper to respect that recommendation.
* A report of the House Committee on Military Affairs, Feb. 1, 1828, recom-
mended appropriating $50,000 to begin the works at Pensacola (NA, HF, Repts.
Comm. Mil. Affairs, 20 Cong., 1 sess.; printed, H. Rept. 119, 20 Cong., 1 sess.).
This sum was appropriated by act approved Mar. 19, 1828 (4 STAT. 256). Capt.
William H. Chase was designated to superintend the construction but delay was
caused by difficulty in locating the site (Chase to the Chief Engineer, Feb. 22,
1828, NA, WD, CE Lets. Recd., C 281; Chief Engineer to Chase, May 27, 1828.
loc. cit., Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 3). The Board of Engineers met at
Newport late in the summer by direction of the Chief Engineer (Chief Engineer
to Bernard, Aug. 6, 1828, A. Mordecai to Chase, Aug. 7, 1828, loc. cit.). Differing
in opinion the board members decided to give Bernard time to complete plans
for the fortification (Bernard, Joseph G. Totten, and Chase to the Chief Engineer,
Sept. 8, 1828, loc. cit., Lets. Recd., B 539). Chase made his way to New Orleans,
requesting that $10,000 be deposited at Mobile; the office of the Chief Engineer
complied (Chase to the Chief Engineer, Sept. 24, 1828, loc. cit., Lets. Recd.,
C 341; Mordecai to Chase, Oct. 4, 1828, loc. cit., Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk.
3). Late in 1828 Chase reached Pensacola from New Orleans and began prepa-
rations to build the military work that was to be named Fort Pickens (Chase to
the Chief Engineer, Dec. 15, Dec. 16, Dec. 21, 1828, loc. cit., Lets. Recd., C 366,
C 360, C 365). Additional correspondence may be found in the cited files of the
Chief Engineer concerning the construction of the fort for which $440,000 was
appropriated between 1828 and 1834.

request that Congress may extend to us, the right of removing our
preemptions to unsold lands—We are all and but few in number

fore feel confident, that your Honorable Bodies, will now grant to

the removal of such tribes of Indians as may consent to go west of

effected—
Co." Thomas. L. M*Kenney, is better quallified to suceed in this
measure than any other person, and if he can be sent to Florida next
spring. he will do more to conciliate the Indians and satisfy them,
of the advantage which will attend their change of residence, than all
the commissioners you could select. My acquaintance with the In-

whether I would clear out Live Oak and Cedar Timber, cut from
lands occupied by persons entitled to the right of preemption, under
is See ante, p 504, n. In his annual report of Nov. 26, 1827, Barbour again
urged the adoption of a general system of removal (NA, WD, SW Lets. to Pres.,
Bk. 2; printed in Cong. Debates, 20 Cong., 1 sess., pt. 2, appendix, p. 2789, and in
S. Doc. 1, 20 Cong., 1 sess., p. 47).
* No reply found, but DuVal evidently had an interview with Secretary
Barbour; see DuVal to McKenney, July 17, 1828, post, vol. XXIV.

the Act of Congress, of the 22. April 1826;” To such applicants,
I gave for answer that, although the Law gives them the right of
preemption, yet, that the absolute right to the Land cannot vest
in them, until it has been regularly brought into market, purchased
at public sale, or subsequently entered, and paid for; that until this
was done, The right remains in the United States. When your con-
venience permits, I will be gratified with your opinion on this subject.
Some complain of my being unnecessarily rigid on this subject,
as well as on the nature of the evidence required, of Timber being
cut from private Lands. It has I understand, been the custom to
permit idle vagrants, who have no regular home, or stake in society,
and who are generally employed as labourers to bring Timber to mar-
ket, to take their testimony, that the Timber has been cut from
private Lands; such testimony I consider, to say the least, of a very
equivocal nature. Almost my first act was, to let it be distinctly
understood, that such testimony would be rejected by me, and that
I would require the evidence of some respectable free-holder, properly
authenticated before a judicial officer; the consequence has been,
that hardly any Timber has been brought to this place, since I have
been in the office. There are many settlements, valuable only for
the Live Oak hammocks on them, and if the Timber was destroyed,
both the Land and Timber, would be lost to the Government, and the
right of preemption would never be claimed.
There has for several years past, been great devastation and
slaughter of valuable Timber, and I have no doubt but most of it was
from public Lands, and it is much to be regretted, that this waste of
valuable Timber, is generally confined to that which is most valuable
to the United States, being on convenient water courses, affording
every facility of transportation, whenever the Government may re-
quire it. It becomes the serious duty of every officer, to nurse and
protect an article, so essential to the wealth and prosperity of our
country. If I have, in this conscientious opinion of my duty, done
injustice to any individual, I much regret it, and it will afford me
pleasure to corrected.”
I have the honor to be with great respect Your most Ob" S**

THE POSTMASTER GENERAL TO DELEGATE WHITE
[NA:PO, PMG Letter Book Tl
POST OFFICE DEPART Jan. 29. 1828
HON. Jose.PH M. WHITE Ho. of Rep
A few days Since I rec" a letter from the P. M. at Tallahassee on
the Subject of the currency which should be received for postages.”
He stated that he had formerly been in the habit of receiving notes
of different Banks, and had sustained a loss in consequence of it.
The answer given him is the same which has been uniformly given
to Post Masters in other places; viz, that a P. Master is not bound to
receive any other money for postages than what is current with the
revenue officers of the U. States. It always affords me great Satis-
faction to accommodate the wishes of the Citizens of any community;
but the United States knows of but one currency, and for the proceeds
of the Dept, its head must account in that currency. Should a Post
Master be directed to receive other currency, and a loss should be
sustained, that loss could not justly fall upon the P. Master, and the
accounting officers of the Treasury would not admit it to the credit
of the Dept. To assume this responsibility in one case, would involve
the necessity of doing so in others; and the consequence would be
ruinous.

within the limits of the following described townships and fractional

TO CO'JOSEPH M WHITE, Delegate in Congress,
SIR, The public road now making from Camp Pinckney, Georgia,
to Musquito, under the Superintendance of Lieut Brown of the
Quarter masters department is nearly completed.
The work, So far, has been accomplished to the entire satisfaction
of this community: no road at the South, it is Said by those who have
had opportunity for comparison, is Superior to it—and it will remain
a permanent benefit to East Florida.
The bridge, over the S* Sebastian's, we are informed, is Soon to be
erected, and it is an object of great interest to the whole of this Section
of Florida—We therefore earnestly request of you, to use all proper
exertions to obtain from the department of war an order, charging
Lieut. Brown with the Superintendance of this work, and that it be
executed by the troops now detached on the road, aided by the
Company of artillery, in garrison at this post—And then we shall
feel assured, that the bridge will be well and durably built, in a manner
corresponding with the importance of the object—
We have Solicited your particular attention to this Subject, as our
delegate, because we understand, that otherwise, the bridge may be
built by contract, which will not only more than double the expense,
but we shall then fear, that we may Suffer, as heretofore, in the
construction of public roads in the territory, where the unfaithfulness
of the contractor, has nearly or quite defeated the munificent inten-
tions of Government in our favour—

[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 2 sess.:ADS “]
[February 13, 1828]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress Assembled
The Petition of William Hasell Hunt respectfully sheweth, that
he has for the last two years held the Office of Clerk of the United
States District and Superior Court for the Western District of Florida:
That a Law of the United States approved May 26th 1824, entitled
“An Act to amend an act entitled ‘an act to amend an act for the
establishment of a Territorial Government in Florida, and for other
purposes’ ” provides, that the Clerks of the United States' District
Courts in Florida “shall receive, in all cases under the laws and
constitution of the United States, the same fees, which the Clerks
of the District Courts of the next adjoining States receive for similar
services.”* That your Petitioner is credibly informed and well
convinced, that the Clerk of the United States' District Court for
the Territory of Orleans, and for the State of Louisiana has uniformly
charged, been allowed, and received, a per diem allowance, for every
day said Courts has been held, of Five Dollars. Your Petitioner is
further well informed and believes that it was the intention of Con-
gress, at the time the law was passed which is quoted above, to allow
to the Clerks in the Territory of Florida the same per diem compensa-
tion as the Clerks in other United States' courts have always been
allowed: Nevertheless Your Petitioner most respectfully represents
that he has never been allowed or received one dollar as a per diem
allowance or compensation for attending the United States' District

& Superior Court of West Florida as Clerk thereof—but that his
accounts therefore, though regularly examined allowed and signed by
the Hon the Judge of said Court, have uniformly been disallowed &
rejected, on settlement of the Marshal's accounts at the Treasury
Department.
Your Petitioner further states and represents that during the two
years which have elapsed since he received the appointment of Clerk
as aforesaid the profits of said office have not amounted to the sum
of Three hundred Dollars for the whole time.
Your Petitioner, therefore, most humbly and respectfully prays
that a law may be passed, allowing to your petitioner the sum of one
hundred and seventy Dollars, which is justly due to him; as will
appear by reference to the accompanying account. And that by a
law which cannot be misunderstood or misconstrued, the Clerks of
the United States' Courts within the Territory of Florida, may be
placed on a footing with the Clerks of other United States' District
Courts on the subject of per diem allowance.

WASHINGTON CITY, February 16* 1828.
HoN* JoSEPH M. WHITE Delegate of Florida. Washington City
General Bernard had the honor to receive M* White's note in
relation to the coast of Florida on the Gulf, and more especially to
Pensacola-Harbour and S" Joseph's Bay. At the entrance of the
former, and over its bar, there is (at low tide) twenty feet of water;
at the entrance of the latter, and over its bar, there is (at low tide)
seventeen feet about. From the shallow bay of Vacasausa to Mobile
Bay, over the bar of which there is a depth of sixteen feet at low tide,
Pensacola and S. Joseph’s Bay are the only harbours of importance
to our national navy. On account of a greater depth at its entrance,
and of being more easily defended by land batteries, Pensacola has a
decided advantage over S. Joseph's Bay.”
With great respects.

SIR, In reply to the enquiries Contained in your note of this

importance of fortifying the harbour of Pensacola remains unchanged—
Recent examinations have only served to confirm this opinion, and to
demonstrate the superior advantages which this Harbour is found
to possess over all others on this Coast, as a site for a naval deposite.
The Bay of St Josephs, which was at one time supposed to possess
advantages superior to those of the Harbour of Pensacola, has been
particularly examined during the past year by a member of the
Board of Engineers, and is found to have a less deposite of Water on
the bar than can be carried into Pensacola.
The Department feels satisfied therefore of the urgent necessity of
providing for the defence of a harbour, the security of which will

JOHN W. SIMONTON TO PHILIP P. BARBOUR 57
[NA:SF, 20 Cong., 1 sess. :ALS]
WASHINGTON CITY March 5 1828
SIR For the purpose of showing to your Honorable Committee, the
necessity of establishing a court of Admiralty & of general jurisdiction
at Key West—that is, of erecting an additional Judicial District in
Florida, to include within its limits, the Islands and Keys, and Such
portion of the Southern extremity of the Peninsula, as may make a
convenient division of the present district of East Florida, I beg leave
respectfully to Submit for your consideration, the following facts and
Statements, –
Key West, from its general Geographical character and relations,
and from the existing population within the contemplated district,
must doubtless be considered the only eligible peint point, at which
the court can at present be directed to be holden,-
Its remote position, forbids the idea, that it can in practice, receive
any judicial benefits from the either of the three courts which have
already been established in Florida viz at Pensacola, S' Augustine &
Tallahassee, -the former place being nearly six, and the two latter
upwards of four hundred miles distant, It is therefore at present,
* Brown was authorized, Apr. 10, 1828 (NA, WD, QMG Lets. Sent, Bk. 12),
to divert the fund as he requested. In the voluminous correspondence concern-
ing the construction of the bridge the following letters are of interest: the Quarter-
master General to Brown, Sept. 18, and Nov. 28, 1828 (loc. cit.); and Brown to
the Quartermaster General, Mar. 11, Apr. 18, June 3, July 2, July 30, and Oct.
12, 1828 (loc. cit., Consolidated Corr. File). The last letter contains an estimate
of the materials and labor required to construct the bridge.

and will continue to be, unless a court is established there, completely
without the benefit of law, because beyond the reach of its judicial
administration
Key West, with the Southern portion of Florida is already too im-
portant, while it is rapidly advancing in consequence, to be suffered
to remain in this unprotected and lawless state—Its commanding
position on the Gulf, not only with respect to the vast commerce
which is carried on between the Mississippi and the Atlantic ports
of the U States, but as to Cuba also, and the whole sea board of
Mexico & Central America—Its valuable Harbor, its important trade,
which, if fostered by Government, may be increased to an Amount
which I should be unwilling even to name to the Committee—Its
advantages with a proper court, to guard and regulate the immense
wrecking business of the Florida reef & coast, and in that way, to
subserve the interest of humanity and of commerce, are each of them,
considerations that may well be urged on the attention of Congress.—
At least two hundred vessels from various domestic and foreign
ports, enter the Port of Key West every Year, and the Revenue col-
lected there and actually paid into the Treasury since the year 1823
amounts to $63.276.18/100 while all the other ports of the Territory
has only paid, since the commencement of the Government in 1821,
the sum of $6,792-64/100, making a difference of $56,483.54/100,”
Besides which there is at least from three to four hundred thousand
Dollars worth of wrecked property brought into that port every Year
which cannot be disposed of under existing circumstances, without
giving great dissatisfaction to the parties concerned.—The valuable
fisheries also, of that coast, should not be forgotten, There is at
present upwards of thirty fishing smacks, owned by entirely by
American Citizens, engaged in carrying live fish to the Havana Market,
which brings into our Country at least $75,000.00/100 annually
in specie-
Beleiving that the propriety and advantages of the proposed Court,
not only to Florida, but to the U States and to Commerce generally,
are so evident when presented to view. that the brief sketch which
I have given, will effectually recommend the subject to the Considera-
tion of the Committee—I will not longer intrude upon their time in
respect to it

confined to entire sections.

The term of “a Township of Land” as a description of a grant of

V, 482).
* The act approved Apr. 5, 1826, must be intended (6 STAT. 339); there was
no act of 1827 relative to the Asylum. See White to Graham, Feb. 8, 1828
(NA, GLO, Misc. Lets. Recd.), enclosing documents and expressing the hope
that claims of the Asylum not made according to law would be rejected. The only

Township lines of the public Surveys
When however Congress has granted a Township of Land to be
located, according to this restricted sense of the term, the word
“entire or complete” has been uniformly used.—See the Resolution
of the old Congress granting “one complete & entire township” to
A H. Dorhman for services rendered to the US." Land Laws p 198.

The Act granting a tract of Land to Gen' Lafayette designates the
grant as “one township of Land” to be laid out and located under the
authority of the President in any of the unappropriated Lands of the
U.S.82
When this Act was passed it was the general impression that the
Land would be selected in Florida a very small part of which Territory
had at that time been surveyed; if the word “entire” therefore had
been inserted in the Act it would have confined the location to
the lands actually surveyed or would have deferred it until the Land
intended to be located should have been regularly surveyed.
On the passage of the law it was therefore decided that the term
Township of Land as used in that law, was not be taken in its most
restricted sense, and in deciding on the manner in which it should be
located a reference was had to the only case which the Law afforded
of a grant of a Township for a similar object, to wit, that to A H
Dorhman, and directions were given to confine the location to a

Township of the public surveys if the Lands selected by the Agent
should have been surveyed, but if they had not been surveyed, then
to confine the location to a body of Land six miles square, with the
lines running to the cardinal points. This township was however
located on one that had been previously surveyed as public Lands.
The Act granting a township of Land to the Kentucky Asylum for

Congress p 24.” directs its location in one of the Territories on Lands
to which the Indian title had been extinguished and in each of which

The act making this grant, as it passed in the H of Rep" limited the
location of the Land, by express words to an entire body, but this
part of the Act was stricken out in the Senate. Under this view of the
question you decided that the terms, one township of Land as used

Map itself contains so many notices of Routes & of places that ther
is but little left to state beside, except in explanation. -
The whole country between this and Mobile Bay is a sterile Pine
Barren, without a single plantation's space of good land; and is
consequently entirely unsettled, excepting here & there a family
whose only business it to raise stocks of Cattle, on which they depend
for support.
First are the Roads to Mobile Point. That from Pensacola to
Mobile Point is strictly a Military Road, and when opened, will be
used for Military purposes only.—The nearest as well as the best
Route for this Road is to cross the Perdido at Innerarity's and Bear
Point.—This route is nearly a direct line & will not exceed 55 miles
in distance. It is about 25 miles from this place to the extreme end
of Innerarity's point, -the country, is flat, low and wet, but perfectly
firm, pine woods, & will require only one Bridge, at the little Bayou
near Cant Clinch, over which there is now a Bridge.—The remaining
streams it crosses are in considerable rivulets & having sandy bottoms
require no bridges. From Bear Point, the first fifteen miles is over
a very high, sandy, open Black Jack Ridge, which extends itself
along the coast, varying from half a Mile to a mile in width, between
the Lagoons along the Seashore & the low, flat, pine woods back:—the
next eight miles is over the same kind of sandy Ridge, but the growth
is an almost impenetrable thicket of scrub Oaks—and the remaining
five miles will be along the Sea Beach. This part of the Route is
intersected by no streams whatever.—There is no person to keep Ferry
at this crossing place, nor is there ever likely to be one except in time of
war.—But as there is a ferry a few miles above, called “Pancho's
ferry,” I have traced out that for a Road, for present travelling by
that ferry.—You will notice that the old spanish Road leads to this
place; & from thence I have marked a trail to be opened by Miflin's
Mills, to interesect the Road proposed from Blakely to the Point,
which it will do in about twelve miles from Pancho’s. This Route
to Mobile point is about Sixty miles—not much longer than the
other but will require four considerable Bridges in that distance of
twelve miles. These Creeks however are but seldom swimming,
though in heavy rains they are swolen, especially Soldier's Creek
and Mill Creek, into torrents but being short they run down in a
few days time, & then become easily fordable, therefore it would
be unnecessary now to expend the time & labor to bridge them.—The
Road from Blakely to Mobile point must necessarily pass down as
marked & intersect that which is proposed to go direct from Pensacola
by Bear point near eighteen miles from the Point; consequently there
will be but one to open for that distance; and moreover after they

and which will be more trouble to clear out than ten times the distance
of open Pine Woods. The Route from Blakely will be on the Ridge
between the waters of Perdido and Mobile Bays; and crosses no
streams requiring Bridges except the Bay Minette, over which there
is now a Bridge. This Ridge loses itself near the Head of Bon Secour
Bay & the Road then enters on flat, low & wet, but firm, pine land
for six or eight miles until it strikes the black Jack Ridge, before
spoken of, near the sea coast.—The distance from Blakely to Mobile
Point on this Road will be about Sixty five miles.—
Second, are the Routes to Blakely.—of these there are three;—first
by “Panchos ferry,” and which continues for near fifty miles along
the old spanish Road leading to the “Willage” where there was a
ferry formerly to cross over to Mobile. The distance to Blakely on
this Route is about Sixty miles; the first thirty miles being of the flat
Pine woods & the remainder a high dry Pine Barren. There is but
one Bridge upon this Route;—being the same with that where the
Road from Blakely to Mobile Point will cross the Bay Minette—
Indeed it would be the same Road for near thirty miles of the dis-
tance.—The distance by this Route from Pensacola to Blakely is
about Sixty miles.—
The second Route is by “English's Mills & Blunts ferry.” This
Route has once been travelled but is now abandoned; and is not to be
thought of as a route for the Road.—Ten thousand dollars expended
on it from here to the Perdido would not make it as good a Road as
that which now leads to “Owen's ferry” on the Perdido is, in a
state of nature.—It is however the Route which has had most favor
with many of the people here because it has been represented as being
the shortest; but those who entertain these opinions have in general
no personal knowledge of it whatever; nor of the country generally.—
It is undoubedly shorter than that by “Owens ferry,” but it is about
the same distance as that by “Pancho's ferry.”
The Third Route is by “Owens ferry, Bell fountain & Halls.”—
This Route is a high dry Ridge requiring no Bridges, & crosses no
stream but the Perdido River.—The distance on this Route is about
seventy five miles; and is now the only Road used for travelling in
carriages between the two places. Although this Route is the longest,
yet as it is a good Road, practicable at all seasons, & not liable to be
interrupted, by having a wide ferry, as is the case at Panchos, which
could not be passed in windy weather; it has a decided preference over
either of the other two Routes. moreover opening & straightening
it will abridge the distance materially.
The shortest Route to connect Pensacola & Mobile being about
fifty miles is the old spanish Road terminating at “the Village” on

Mobile Bay & would require very little labor to clear it out; but the
want of a ferry here; and the great advantage of a permanently
established steam ferry Boat making a trip daily between Blakely
& Mobile determine that to be the most suitable pont for the Road
to terminate at:—Besides the regular mail route goes to that place.
The intercourse to be carried on by means of these Roads, when
actually opened & put in order is very little indeed; and as there are
no merchantile transactions between the places will ever be limited.
Therefore no great expense should be incurred in opening them.
Whatever may be done on any of these Roads by the Military, will
so remain; and if streams be crossed and bridged, there are no In-
habitants to keep up the Roads in the same condition; and in two or
three years at farthest when these bridges get out of order, travellers
would be forced on the old Routes.
I would myself recommend only, that if any thing be done, the
Routes should be properly blazed out & the immediate trace of the
Road cleared of all obstructions by Logs &" and making passable
causeways over boggy places, if there should be any such places:—
In short to make nothing more than practicable country Roads, such
as is done by the Inhabitants themselves when opening Roads through
their Pine Forests.—Experience demonstrates that a Road opened
to any width by cutting away the large timber, unless it is very much
used, grows up to be in a year or two a thicket of Pine & Oak Bushes.—
It is not probable that there will be during a period of Peace, any
intercourse with Mobile Point from either Pensacola or Blakely ex-
cept as a Bridle way for Persons on horse back; and but seldom travel-
led in that way even.—But between Pensacola and Blakely there will
always be travelling in carriages, therefore it would be proper to bestow
the most labor & pains on this Route.
If, however, any, or all of these Routes, be opened in manner only
as I have suggested, an army may at any future time hereafter, be
marched over them accompanied with their baggage, at the rate of
Twenty miles a day; by having a body of fifty Pioneers moving in
their front.
All the Routes which are proposed to be traced out & opened in
this manner, are marked on my sketch with a line of red ink.—
I have not made any estimates of the expense of opening these
Roads; for the whole cost of opening such Roads if done by the troops
stationed here, and under the orders of the Com" Officer, Col” Clinch,
would be so inconsiderable as not to be felt in the expenditures of
the Quarter Master's Department, and would be hardly worth notice
for a special appropriation on account of the expense the Dep" would
incur.—I have on hand all the Tools necessary; and a part of the

Transportation, the remaining part of which would be hired at a
very small expense. And I estimate that two working parties of
25 men each would complete the whole in a month's time.—
The distances are as follows viz:—
From Pensacola to Blakely by way of “Owens ferry” is 75 miles
From Blakely to Mobile Point--------------------- is 65 —“—
From Pensacola to Mobile Point by the way of Inner-
arity's and Bear point-------------------------- is 55 —“—
From Barrancas to intersect this Road-------------- is 10 —“—
From Pensacola by the way of Pancho's ferry to the
intersection of the Road from Blakely to Mobile
point----------------------------------------- is 27 —“—
From Barrancas to intersect the Road to Pancho's
ferry------------------------------------------ is 7 —“—
From Pancho's ferry towards Blakely to intersect the
Road from thence to Mobile point---------------- is 18
Total distance 257 miles
You will notice on my sketch the vestiges of a Canal marked as
existing between Bay John and the little Lagoon, near to Mobile
point.—This canal has never to my knowledge been spoken of before
or noticed by any one and was shewn to me by one of the old residents
of the Country who informed me that there was no account or tradi-
tion whatever respecting it among the oldest Inhabitants; so that
it must refer itself for its history to some former period before the
occupation of this Continent by the present race of white Inhabit-
ants.—The distance between the Bay John and little Lagoon where
this canal or ditch connected them, is about half a mile; The timber
has grown up in it as large as elsewhere, and where it passed across
the Black Jack Ridge, the sand has nearly filled it up, though it is
very plain even there; in the Marsh on the Margin of the Bay John,
it is more plain; and in the Hammock on the margin of the Lagoon
it is some five or six feet in depth.—There could have been no object
in such a canal unless to connect the waters of Bon Secour with
Perdido Bay for Boat navigation; and I found it to be the opinion
of those persons who have their cattle in that Range & know the
Country, that the “Little Lagoon” connects itself with the “Cross
tree's Creek,” & so forms the Communication with the Perdido.
And from the Perdido to the “Grand Lagoon” (which is connected
with Pensacola Bay at Barrancas,) there is a low portage of Two
miles only.—
It is almost inconcievable to those who are not personally acquainted
with the Country, how easily and at how little expense, the waters of
Mobile Bay might be connected with those of Pensacola, for all pur-

poses of Steam Boat navigation; & even for Schooners of respectable
size & burthen.—And I think that the facilities which would be ob-
tained to commerce by such a communication, will before many years
cause its being carried into effect.”—

DEAR SIR,-I this day have been favoured through your goodness,
with a perusal of the bill introduced by Mr. King,” and “twice read”
in the Senate of the United States, “supplementary to the several acts
providing for the settlement and confirmation of private land claims
in Florida,”" that such a bill will pass both houses of Congress, and
become a law of a country, famed for the liberality of its laws and
justice, I cannot for a moment believe: the interests of individuals to
be sacrificed, in violation of a treaty, which should be sacred, and
where the faith of the Government is pledged for its just fulfilment!
I can speak feelingly on a matter which will so deeply touch my in-
terests, acquired after a residence of sixteen years in Florida. Now
at an expense of nearly 44,000 dollars say forty-four thousand dollars,
actually expended in the improvement of property, obtained long
prior to the date of limitation, the 24th of January, 1818, from the
lawful authorities of the King of Spain," in confidence of that right

to concede what then belonged to the Spanish Crown, I have improved
those lands as my own; and my books of accounts can be produced,
to show the correctness of what I assert. Perhaps there is no other
individual who has expended so large a sum based on the faith and
justice of the Government. You will recollect, perhaps, from my last
communications on this subject, that I have a Grant for 16,000 acres
of land, divided in three different surveys. Now it is proposed by
this bill to allow me (a league) 5700 acres, in one survey, -5700 acres
of pine land which the Government would sell me for a less number
of dollars. Moreover, to show the inconsistency of such a bill, I
would observe, that in fulfilling the conditions of my Grant in the
first place at the expense of 10,000 dollars, with interest, I built a
water mill at the back line of one survey; and recently a steam mill
in the front line, as per the annexed; which are more than a “league”
apart. Would the gentleman of the Senate wish to deprive me of
either the one, or the other? For I have a right to the whole, or none.
I only ask any one to take this, as a case in point, to themselves, and
it will show the injustice of such an act.
If possible, I will visit Washington during the next week, and I
think by a personal interview with some of the members of both
houses, I will be enabled to get a separate bill, or to have some influ-
ence, as a person largely interested, in preventing the one in its present
shape from passing. I am certain, very certain, however, it will be
resisted by you to the last. Begging you will excuse the manner in
which I have hastily expressed myself on this subject,”

It appears from the correspondence of the Reg & Rec' of the L. O.
at Tallahassee that in the progress of their decision of the cases of
preemption rights, some errors have been made by them; that some
claims had been admitted on insufficient or fraudulent testimony, and
that several of the claims granted had been located on lands previously
located for the Deaf and Dumb Asylum of Kentucky. Under these
circumstances they requested that the patents in cases of preemption
might be suspended.” The papers were returned to them from this
office with instructions to revise their decisions & report those cases
in which they were of opinion that the patents ought to be suspended
and the reasons for such suspensions"—that report is marked N° 1.
& contains upwards of 40 cases on which the patents are now sus-
pended.” These cases may be divided into the following Classes.
1st Class. Embraces eleven cases suspended on the ground of
fraud or insufficiency of evidence to establish the right of preemption
on the part of the Claimant. This Class of cases depend entirely
on facts of which under the law, the Reg & Rec" are the proper Judges.
I should therefore recommend that they be instructed to reexamine
& decide on the facts, after giving due notice by advertizement, to
the party claiming the preemption and to the party disputing the
right of the time when they will take it up & decide on the cases
respectively & that so far as it respects the Gov" this decision should
be final
2" Class. Embrace Eight cases suspended on the ground that the
claims originated upon lands without the limits of the location for
the Kentucky Asylum, and subsequently to Said location the claim-
ants made their entries within the same and one case where the
location was removed a distance of about 15 miles from one part of
the public lands to another. All these cases it is believed arise under
the provisions of the 3 Sect of the Act giving the right of preemption,”
where two or more persons had Settled on the same quarter Section
& were authorized to purchase one or more quarter Sections as the
case might be, & they have been removed from three fourths to
fifteen miles from the place of original Settlement.
So far as it respects the U.S. these are cases on which a revision
of the decision of the Reg & Rec" should not be required. Altho’
under a fair construction of the Act those officers had a discretionary
power to limit the locations made under the [the 3* Sect. of the

Act to a reasonable distance from the tract originally settled, yet
after they had exercised that discretion with all the facts before
them, which they can now have, I should not think that the U.S.
could with propriety require that a revision of those decisions should
be had.—Eight of these cases are however located by the Deaf &
Dumb Asylum on the ground that the original settlement was without
the limits, and that the relocation was made within the limits of
their locations after they had been approved by the Sec of the
Treasury Altho' by a fair construction of the law the Register &
Receiver might have exercised a discretionary power in limiting the
relocations under the]" provisions of the 3" Section of this law,
yet there is no express provision giving a preemptive right to any
particular quarter Section under the 3" Section as there is under the
2"Section of the Act, which does give a preemptive right to any of
the adjoining % Sections. I therefore Consider these relocations as
having been made on lands previously appropriated and rightfully
claimed by other persons under the decision of the Secretary of the
Treasury, and therefore void. In the ordinary cases of this kind
which occur at this office, patents are issued to the first purchaser
and the money refunded to the last purchaser.
3" Class. Embraced three cases suspended upon the ground that
the claims originated north of the Alabama line. The line run by
Ellicot as the line of demarkation between the U S and Spain, has
always been deemed the Southern boundary of Alabama. In survey-
ing the lands in Alabama the Surveys did not in many cases abut on
this line, and Col. Butler the Surveyor for Florida, was instructed to
connect his Surveys with those that had been made in Alabama,"
Such parts of those Surveys however which lie north of Ellicott's line
are within the State of Alabama, and the sale of such lands within
them as may have been sold at Tallahassee require to be legalized
by an act of Congress.
4th Class. Embraces eighteen cases suspended under writs of man-
damus, the lands having been located in eights of different Sections
and quarter Sections, and not as the law required in quarter Sections.
5th Class—embraces three cases suspended under writs of manda-
mus allowing three quarter Sections to two persons who had settled
on the same quarter section, contrary to the provisions of the 3"Sect.
of this Act.—
In relation to these two classes of claims, see the papers & corre-
spondence relating to the decisions of Judge Woodward marked N° 2
& N° 3.—

as an omission.

The fair construction of the 3"Section of this Act, taken in connec-
tion with its general provisions, and without reference to the proviso,
would be, that where two persons had settled on the same quarter or
fractional quarter Section, they would be entitled to purchase one
other quarter Section; that where three persons had settled on the
same quarter or fractional quarter Section they would be entitled to
purchase two other quarter sections and so on, because any other
construction would give the right of purchasing any number of quarter
sections; the term “more” being unlimited. But the proviso to this
Section would seem to make this construction incontrovertible. The
portion of the fractional quarter Section was given in addition to one
entire quarter, because it might occur that several persons had settled
on a fractional Quarter Section that did not perhaps contain 20 acres
of Land.
In relation to these two classes of claims, I would therefore recom-
mend that the writ of error be prosecuted, and that a decision as to
the two points be had at the next Court if possible, in which decision
the Gov" would acquiesce.—
6th Class.—embraces one case suspended on the ground that the
Claimant is a free negro. I know of no law of the U States which
prohibits a free negro from purchasing lands, unless there be some
express law of the Territory by which they are excluded from pur-
chasing, I perceive no reason why a patent should not issue.—

Many difficulties arise in these Surveys such as the impracticability
of closing many private claims from marshes & quagmires impass-
able, numbers have never been Surveyed, other than beginnings
established, or calls depending upon each other, the amount of land
Seldom corresponds with the grants when run to the calls thereof,
and many claim interfere with each other—Some of the claims have
So indefinite beginnings that to identify them would be impossible,
others Can Never be surveyed owing to the location being imprac-

ditions, to be made part of the Said Charter:
That the route of the contemplated canal Shall be determined, by

the Chipola Canal Company shall conform thereto in the execution of
the powers vested in them to construct a Canal; and that their future

that the Bar at Pensacola should be so deepened as to enable vessels
of the largest Class to enter the Harbor. Can you oblige me by
furnishing from your Department an Estimate of the Expense of
removing the Bar, so as to admit a Wessel drawing 27 feet—as I wish
to make immediate use of the information, you will confer a favor, by
an early answer.—A general estimate without stating the particular
grounds of it will be sufficient”

SIR, The payment of the Militia named in the muster rolls you

into service in obedience to Gov. Duvall's requisition and that a due
proportion of Officers to the number of privates, only were detailed.
In the muster rolls furnished there are 5 field and staff, and 2 com-

Were there any other companies than Capt" Arnan's detailed If
not why were those Officers detailed?
If satisfactory answers can be given to these questions, and the
pay rolls which are enclosed herewith returned signed by the persons
named, with an order from them on the back to remit the money to

SIR I had the honour of addressing you on the [blank] of February
last" on the subject of 121 African negroes then in my custody at
Key West; I have since removed them to this place for greater safety;
while they were at Key West, attempts were made to take them
from the possession of my deputy by force and by bribery; and the
night before I removed them from the Island, an attempt was made to
carry off a part of them; Cap: Doane of the Revenue Cutter Marion
assisted me with one of his officers, and part of his crew, to protect
the Africans; and on a requisition from Col" Pinkney and myself,
convoyed the vessel in which I transported the negroes, from Key
West to this place: I deemed it absolutely necessary to remove the
negroes from Key West; they were not safe there, but the removal was
attended with considerable expense: They were placed in my custody
perfectly naked, many of them sick and extremely weak and feeble;
it was necessary to clothe them, and humanity required that medical
aid should be furnished the sick: I have used the greatest economy
in the disbursements, and for their removal, clothing, medical at-
tendance and rations, have paid upwards of Three thousand dollars:
I am not in a situation to lay out of so large a sum without serious in-
convenience, and as it is almost impossible to raise money in Florida,
I hope you will take this case into consideration, and advance to me
Four thousand dollars: Should this case come within the acts of

The Governor of Florida requests “that one company of regular

“near the centre of population”, “as a nucleus for the militia” in
reference to the blacks of that vicinity—it being “known that many of

withdrawn from Florida, to the vicinity of New Orleans"—leaving
an insufficient number for the establishment of a new post; that the
distribution of regiments, into detachments of less than several com-
panies, greatly augments the expense of their maintenance & is
highly injurious to their efficiency, &, finally, that I am not aware
that we have ever established a military post solely on the grounds of
the Governor's application.
I am also required to report on the proposition, submitted by the
same authorities, of sending two companies to garrison Thompson's
Island (Key West) in reference to the growing importance, & the
defenceless state of the U. States' revenue at that place.
I have already stated that, four of the companies, now in that part
of Florida within this department, will soon be withdrawn, & have
also suggested the impolicy of a too minute distribution of those
which will remain. I beg leave to add, that the known unhealthiness
of the Island would render me extremely reluctant to send to it a
permanent garrison, except, in a case of high necessity; that, to my
knowledge, the United States' naval commander on the West-India
station is in the habit of sending vessels there for the protection of
our commerce & revenue, & that, for the same purposes, the Island
was, very recently, the centre of the cruising limits of the Revenue
Cutter, The Florida.
For the foregoing reasons I should, without special instructions,
deem it inexpedient to establish, at this time, a new military post
either near the head of S*Mark's river, or at Thompson's Island.
Whilst on the distribution of the troops in that part of Florida
which is within this department, I will request you to call the attention
of the Secretary to paragraph, 2, of my orders of the 3rd instant—a
copy of which has been already forwarded to your office. It will be
seen that in the excution of the orders from general head-quarters,
therein referred to, I deemed it expedient to break up the the post,
Camp King, occupied by a single company. This was done under
the general authority to send four companies of the 4th Infantry from
Florida to the vicinity of New Orleans, without specification of the
posts from which they should be taken;—from the considerations
suggested above, & from the conviction that the importance of the
post was by no means commensurate with the extra expense of send-
ing to it supplies, over land, from Tampa Bay, 120 miles.—The com-
manding officer at Cantonment Brooke will be instructed, should he
deem it necessary to the protection of the Indian Agent & his au-

Your letter of the 10" ult” ” has been duly considered. Of your
disposition to observe the law, I am satisfied. The Section which
provides that “No Post Master, or Ass" P. M., Shall act as agent for
lottery offices, or under any color of purchase or otherwise, vend
lottery Tickets,” effectually cuts off the distinction which you make
betwixt W. H. Hunt Lottery Agent, and W. H. Hunt P. M. The
same person cannot act in both capacities, because the law renders
the office of the one incompatible with the business of the other.
The intention of the law is rightly apprehended by you; but as Con-
gress determined to Secure that intention by Suffering no P. M. nor
Ass' to hold the Situation except on the condition that he would be
entirely disengaged from lottery business, their law cannot be evaded.
There must be no connection whatever betwixt a P. M., or a person
employed in his office, and a Vender of lottery Tickets.

ROBERT BUTLER TO GEORGE GRAHAM
[NA:GLO, Lets. from SG, Fla.:LS]
Surveyors Office TALLAHASSEE April 15" 1828.
SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
under date 27" ultimo" in answer to my letters of the 11" ultimo."
The instructions furnished will enable me I hope to make my returns
Satisfactorily.
The returns of M" Donelson" will not be completed in time this
evening to check them with his account, and I am therefore induced
to Postpone the forwarding of my Quarterly account until the Suc-
ceeding mail. From information obtained of the Country South and
East, I am induced to believe that the Sum of Six thousand dollars
will be ample for all the purposes required in my Office until I can
take up the Surveying East of the Suwannee river, and have therefore
to request that you will not have the residue forwarded, as I have no
wish to have a control over more of the public funds than my duties
require from time to time.
Enclosed you will receive a copy of the Survey of Forbes claim"
furnished me in 1824, by M. Carnachan," upon which I founded the
Connection of the Public Surveys.
In the progress of my examination of the private claims which have
been Surveyed I find the absence of the report of the Register and
Receiver of claims which appears to have received the Sanction of
Congress in the 5" Section of an act approved 22nd April 1826."
I have written to M'. Cairo " for a copy, but fearful he may not
be in possession of it, will be obliged to you to direct a copy to be
Sent to this Office, Several township plats otherwise ready to be
forwarded to your Office must be withheld on that account.”

surveys (NA, GLO, Lets. from SG, Fla.), which were acknowledged on May 2
(NA, GLO, Lets. to SG, IV), and concerning which Graham wrote on May 5
that the surveys were not numbered in the usual manner and that he should be
governed by instructions in the future (loc. cit.).

THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:ND, SN Executive Letter Book, No. 1]
NAVY DEPARTMENT 16th April 1828
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
SIR. The 3" Section of the “act for the gradual improvement of
the Navy of the United States”, authorises the President, “to
take proper measures to preserve the live oak timbers growing
on the lands of the United States,” and “to reserve from sale such
lands, belonging to the United States, as may be found to contain
live oak or other timber in sufficient quantity to render the same
valuable for Naval purposes”.”—
The 3" Section of the “Act making appropriations for the support
of the Navy for the year 1828”, appropriates Ten thousand dollars
for the purchase of such lands as the President of the United States
may think necessary and proper, to provide live oak and other timber
for the use of the Navy, to be paid out of the money appropriated
for the gradual improvement of the Navy."—
Under these provisions a purchase has been made of all the private
claims upon the neck or isthmus of land between Santa Rosa Sound
and Pensacola Bay.—A purchase has also been made of a part, and
Contracts are now making for the remainder of the Claims upon the
tract lying between the Navy Yard at Pensacola on the East, Perdido
River and Bay on the West, Big and Rill Bayou on the North, and
the Gulf of Mexico upon the South.—When these latter contracts
shall have been completed, the United States will own the whole of
these two tracts of land."—
* Approved Mar. 3, 1827, 4 STAT. 242.
* Approved Mar. 19, 1828, 4 STAT. 256.
* Land for the live oak plantation was acquired by deeds of Mar. 10, 1828,
from Joseph M. White and Henry M. Brackenridge, through his attorney in
fact, Joseph M. White. The deeds are printed in A. S. P., Naval Affairs, III,
932, 941. The original deeds together with maps, tracings, and descriptions of
the land are in the Real Estate Division, Bureau of Yards and Docks, Navy
Department. Correspondence and articles of agreement relative to the pur-
chase of the land from the files of the Secretary of the Navy are printed ibid.,

Examinations have been carefully made under the direction of the
Navy Department into the situation of both these tracts and I have
to report, that, on both, there are large quantities of valuable live
oak, and other timber, useful for Naval purposes, and that they are
both admirably fitted, by their location and other circumstances, for
the planting and Cultivation of live oak, and that by a prudent use
of it, forests of that timber may there be created which will be
incalculably important in the future progress of the Navy.—
I have also consulted the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
who informs me that it is not important to the public interest that
these tracts should be offered for sale."—
I have therefore respectfully to request, that directions may be
given to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, to reserve
both from sale, and that they may be placed under the exclusive
control of this Department, with a view that the timber upon them
may be preserved and nursed, and live oak planted upon such portions
where it is not now growing, as are fitted for it."—
The reservations desired are.—
1* All that tract of land lying between Pensacola Bay and Santa
Rosa Sound, and extending East wardly to a line drawn from the
head of East River (which falls into Pensacola Bay at East River
Bay) due South until it strikes Santa Rosa Sound.—
2" All that tract of land lying between the Navy Yard, Perdido Bay
and River, the Gulf of Mexico, and Grand or Big Bayou, and a line
p.931 et seq., and H. Rep. 102, 21 Cong., 2 sess., together with subsequent cor-
respondence concerning the management of the plantation, which was entrusted
to Henry M. Brackenridge by appointment of Dec. 6, 1828 (NA, ND, SN Gen-
eral Letter Book, No. 17; printed A. S. P., op. cit., III, 946). The correspondence
relating to live oak became very voluminous, and from 1828 is bound in separate
volumes entitled “Live Oak Letters”. In this series are to be found the original
letters from Brackenridge and others concerning the live oak plantation. Not
all of the letters from Brackenridge found their way into that series; others are
in NA (ND, SN Misc. Lets. Recd.), where also are found a few from Del. White.
Reports from Samuel Davis, the overseer on the plantation, are in the sources
cited above.
* Not found. See the Secretary of the Navy to Graham, Jan. 4, 1828 (NA,

to the Secretary, Dec. 19, 1827, and asking if prevention of the timber depreda-
tion could not be handled through the General Land Office. On Feb. 8, 1828
(NA, ND, SN General Let. Bk. 16), Cornell was informed of his appointment as
assistant to Charles Haire in the examination of the public lands (ante, p. 731,
n.). Word of the appointment was sent to Haire at Pensacola, Apr. 15, 1828
(loc. cit.), from which place he had reported to the Secretary, Mar. 22, 1828 (NA,

DELEGATE WHITE TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., W 36:LS]
WASHINGTON 16 April 1828.
TO THE HON. JAMES BARBOUR, Secretary of War,
SIR, I have just received information, that an order has been issued
by Major General Scott, for the Evacuation of Camp King, near the
Indian Agency in Florida, and directing the Company of the 4”
Infantry, now stationed there, to join the Garrison at Tampa.”
I am aware, Sir, that the Indians within the Territory of Florida,
at present are quiet, and have recently given no indications of an
unfriendly disposition; but the removal of these troops—the abandon-
ment of Camp King, will leave them without check; and will expose
an extensive planting district in East Florida, and the Whole popula-
tion of the Alachua Country, now for the first time, after a succession
of embarrassments and misfortunes, exhibiting a State of decided and
growing prosperity, to all the apprehensions and hazards of an
unprotected frontier, bordered by Savages.
At Camp King, these troops are posted between the Indians and
White Settlements; and under the circumstances, interpose a sufficient
security: remove them to Tampa bay, and they are more than a
hundred miles in advance, leaving the whole Indian Nation in their
rear—and the white population, their cattle, Slaves and plantations
unguarded, and open to every variety of Indian assault and depre-
dation.
At best the removal of these troops, will lessen emigration, and
retard the Settlement and prosperity of this valuable part of the
Territory.
Viewing the subject as I do, I should forego the performance of a
duty, and hazard the interests of my constituents, expecially in that
part of Florida to which this communication has reference, did I not
zealously urge on your consideration, the importance and necessity of
countermanding the order for removal, and continuing the Garrison
at Camp King, for the present, and till the accumulating population
and increased strength of the Country, shall be equal to its own
protection.

If the demands of the service generally, have made it necessary to
withdraw any part of the Military force from Florida, so that three
companies only, can remain for Camp King and for Tampa bay, -I
beg leave to state, from my local Knowledge of the district, that these
companies divided, and one remaining at Camp King, will afford a
much more effectual and satisfactory protection, than would the
three concentrated at Tampa.
I have the honor to be [MS. illegible.]

removal of the troops from Camp King, advises that it may not be

INDEX NOTE
In compiling the list of names of persons for this index, deficiencies in spelling
found in the text have been corrected, in so far as sources now available permit,
and variants found throughout the text have been assembled in parentheses. The
nearly illegible character of the handwriting in some instances, which leaves the
reader in doubt as to the writer's intent, and the obvious ignorance, or careless-
ness, often displayed by the signatories account for many variations in orthog-
raphy. With respect to the signers of petitions, like names, with identical spell-
ing, are also frequently attached to successive documents on related subjects from
the same locality; yet a comparison of the handwriting discloses occasional impor-
tant differences. In such instances separate entries have been made in the index,
though the reader is warned that names were often written in by hands other than
the subscribers’; finality in this regard cannot therefore be established in every
case. On the other hand the fact that the same name is variously spelled in
sequential documents does not argue against identity of person, which is likewise
disclosed by a comparison of handwriting as well as by such other tests as docu-
ments of legal record, genealogical data, and whatever knowledge of the various
residences of a given person may be derived from the papers embodied in the
present volume. But whenever there is doubt as to such identity a separate
entry has been made. In some instances the index material is organized according
to office or function under a duplication of the principal entry (see DuVal, Wil-
liam P.).
Names of English origin have been listed in the index as written (if the signature
was not by mark); but Spanish names, which appear in the text written phonet-
ically, with much variation, have been entered in the index under the forms com-
monly used in available sources, followed by their variants in parentheses.
