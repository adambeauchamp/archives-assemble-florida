FLORIDA. T E R R I TOR Y 5
That by the last Act of Congress" providing for the election of
members of said council it was provided that the representation there-
of, should be appointed by the Legislative Council, Since that time
thre[e] new counties have been established, and the powers of Said
council not being adequate to give to them a participation in the
legislation of the Territory, this act to equalize the representation
thereof is necessary.
The Legislative Council consists of about eighteen or twenty mem-
bers, and it appears by their appropriation Bill that they employ nine
clerks, about one clerk for every two members, the result of which,
most unnecessary and unaccountable increase of offices, has produced
annually appropriations for arrearages to cover balances due for
printing the laws, and other useful and necessary objects. The regular
appropriations being absorbed by this host of Clerks.
Last year the appropriation was exceeded $2400, and this year the
sum demanded over the usual appropriation is about four thousand
dollars. The committee think it necessary to check this growing evil,
and to reform this manifest abuse, in the local administration. They
have also this year added, one more printer to the list of publishers
of the laws, and have provided for payment to a clerk in the Executive
Office, which Congress has repeatedly refused to Sanction.—Among
the extravagant items to Swell the appropriations, are excessive sums
for revising, stitching laws, Printing-Jetraals, making Manuscript
copies for laws for State Department, when the laws are directed to
be printed, and can thus be preserved in a much more useful form.—
As the organic act of Congress declares, that their acts are in force
until annulled by Congress,” the Committee deem it indispensable to
have their acts sent every year to the two Houses of Congress, that
all obnoxious provisions may be annulled.
The Section of the act relating to Judicial proceedings," affects ex-
isting remedies, prevents the execution of judgments rendered in
obedience to existing laws, and impairs the obligation of contracts,
and is therefore annulled.
The Act regulating the terms of Courts in East Florida," provides
a more convenient and economical arrangement, and requires the
approval of Congress before it can go into effect.
* Approved Apr. 28, 1828, 4 STAT. 265.
* Sec. 5 of act approved Mar. 30, 1822, ante, XXII, 391; 3 STAT. 655.
*An act in addition to the several acts now in force regulating judicial proceed-
ings, approved Feb. 15, 1834 (Fla. Terr., Acts, 1834, pp. 15–19).
"An act to alter and fix permanently the sessions of the Superior Court of the
District of East Florida, approved Feb. 15, 1834 (Fla. Terr., Acts, 1834, p. 45).
This act was approved by Congress in an act approved June 18, 1834 (4 STAT.
677, sec. 5).

PETITION TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE SENATE
[NA:TD, ST Applications, Collectors of Customs:DS*]
[April, 1834]
To his Excellency the President of the United States and the Honorable
the Senate assembled.
The inhabitants of Fernandina, a Seaport town, in East Florida,
beg leave to State, that the nearest Custom-house in Florida is Seventy
miles from this place; and Since they have been deprived of a Revenue
officer, to perform the duties required by law, they have Suffered from
the loss of the Small trade which they formerly had, and are now much
reduced; as all vessels are obliged to go into Georgia, to enter and
clear, and the Small craft belonging to this place are obliged to pro-
cure their papers from the Said office.
We therefore, respectfully pray, that it may please the President
and the Senate, to restore to Fernandina its privilege, as a port of
delivery, and appoint a Surveyor for this Station.
And your petitioners will ever pray &c

DELEGATE WHITE TO WILLIAM WILSON
[LC:Tallahassee, The Floridian, May 24, 1834]
WASHINGTON, May 8th, 1834.
Dear Sir—I send you a Bill and Report, relating to the local Gov-
ernment of Florida and making some important changes.”
This Bill gives the new Counties a member of the Council. It
was considered proper that every County should have one Represent-
ative without regard to the number of its population. Although
numbers are the basis of representation, and equality in the distribu-
tion is just and desirable, it cannot always be attained.
When I came to Congress, the President appointed the Legislative
Council, and nearly the whole body were selected from Pensacola
and St. Augustine. Considering the geographical divisions of the
Territory, or the Judicial Districts of East, Middle and West Florida,
* Nominated Apr. 9, 1834, and confirmed May 8 (Senate, Exec. Journal, IV,
390, 401).
* Transmitted to Chandler May 9 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets., XXVI). His acknowl-
edgment, June 10, 1834 (NA, SD, Acceptances), states that he was a native of
Georgetown, D. C.
* H. R. no. 457 and Report no. 431. The report is printed in Repts. of Com-
mittees, Vol. 3, 23 Cong., 1 sess., under date of Apr. 30, 1834. Cf. House Journal,
23 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 576, 587, 596,628, 633, 785. The bill as reported became
law in act approved June 18, 1834 (4 STAT. 677).

10 T E R R H TO RIA L PA. P.E. R. S.
the representation is as equal as I could make it, and as the Legisla-
tive Council have power to regulate the whole subject, they can make
such amendments as may be necessary. The truth is that there are
petty politicians in all communities who live by exciting popular
tumult. There may be some of these to find fault with the arrange-
ment, and compare the numbers of some Counties with others.
Exact equality is impossible. It was my wish that Leon county
should have had three, but the committee would not consent to that
number in any County, and as the Legislative Council sits in that
County, it is probable the wishes and interests of the people will be
duly considered and taken care of.—Every one will admit that this
is a great improvement.
I regret to say that the expenditures of the Council created some
dissatisfaction here. They have been limited by this bill. The ar-
rearages would never have been provided for if this bill had not
been reported and passed. The subject was taken up in both Houses,
and the report of the House of Representatives you will find printed
and enclosed herewith. The other Report drawn up by an eminent
statesman and lawyer, would have been made by the Judiciary Com-
mittee of the Senate, if this bill had not been taken up out of its
order, and passed in the House of Representatives.
The 21st section of the Judicial act, produced great dissatisfaction.
Though it might be expected that I should feel some interest on the
subject, when its object was so apparent, I did not feel the slightest
concern—I did not consider it of sufficient moment to answer the
first letter I received on the subject. The law as applied to all past
liabilities is a nullity, and will be so regarded. It is unconstitutional
and void.
It would have produced no emotion here, but for a letter from
Mr. Thompson, in which he stated that it had actually been pleaded
to exempt a deputy marshal from his defalcation from a liability
created, and adjudged under existing laws.
The Legislative Council never could have intended this for such a
purpose. If it has been smuggled in with any design to be used in
that way, the object could never have been perceived by the majority
of the Council. To declare that an execution shall not issue on a
judgment rendered, is not only unprecedented, but is in fact a con-
tempt of Court. As applied to every thing which occurred before
the passage of the law, it is unjust, unprecedented, unconstitutional
and void.
The Legislative Council could never have intended it to be so
applied; and the Court will maintain its jurisdiction and legal rights
by disregarding it. Fortunately too, the 25th section of the Judici-

ary Act of the U. States gives a writ of error for any amount, to the
Supreme Court in all cases where the Constitution is involved.”
In one week more the act will be annulled, but I should have been
equally willing to refer it to the Courts. The committees were unan-
imous in considering it unconstitutional, and in violation of the
organic law, as applied to all liabilities prior to its passage.
I am your most ob’t servant,
JOS. M. WHITE.
WILLIAM WILSON, Esq.
PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF THE
TERRITORY25
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[Referred May 9, 1834]
The undersigned Merchants, Marriners and others interested in the
Commerce and navigation of the Gulph of Mexico but more especially
of the S. Marks Bay & River—Beg leave respectfully to represent
the necessity of a Light House on South Cape Promontory which
forms the Western Shore of Apalachie Bay—
By reference to a Map of these waters it will be seen that South
Cape is the most prominent point of land and the first which is made
by all Vessels approaching the Coast and bound for S' Marks—Its
distance from S' Marks Light is more than 20 Miles, in a South West
Course—The eastern coast of the Gulph below the bay abounds in
Shoals extending a great distance from Shore, and Vessels coming
from that or a Southern direction in avoiding the danger of these
Shoals invariably make the first land off the abovementioned point—
From such a distance the Light at S*Marks situated as it is entirely
within the Bay contributes nothing to the guidance or safety of Vessels
of the larger class—A Light on that point would therefore be of the
highest importance, not only to the trade of S’ Marks but to Vessels
approaching the Coast, and bound to more Westerly Ports—Besides
the reasons here given others of equal force are to be found in the
dangerous shoal which extends from the Cape itself to a distance of
8 miles from shore and on which disasters are of frequent occurrence—
A large portion of the trade of this part of Florida is with the City
* Act approved Sept. 24, 1789, 1 STAT. 73–93.
* This document was evidently transmitted in a covering letter of Feb. 20,
1834, from Jesse H. Willis, the collector of customs at Magnolia, to Del. White.
In the same file is a letter from Willis to Capt. Henry D. Hunter, of the revenue
cutter Taney, Apr. 24, 1834, asking whether South Cape on the west promontory
of the bay was not a better site for a lighthouse than the east end of St. George's
Island. Hunter's reply favored South Cape.

of New Orleans—Wessels arriving from the Westward derive no benefit
from the light at the Mouth of this Harbour which cannot be seen until
after completely doubling the Cape, and the smaller as well as the
larger classes of Vessels are obliged to Anchor or lie to at a distance
of 25 or 30 Miles from Shore from the danger of approaching too near
these shoals, —This in bad weather is always attended with great
delay inconveniance and danger.—A light on the Cape would insure
safe navigation to Apalachie Bay which bringing the S' Marks Light
in view would enable the vessel to steer into safe anchorage ground-
It is universally conceded that the present light should have been
placed on the site which your Memorialists are now solicitous to have
one erected and it is understood to have been the wish of the present
Superintendant to have it placed but that the site having been selected
it could not be changed—

SIR I herewith inclose you a monthly report of the work of im-
proving the harbour of Apalachicola for the months of April & May
1834.” The operations have gone on with a success beyond my
expectations, and will be completed in the course of the month of
June to give a free channel of ten feet water, which is about two feet
better than the old circuitous one The Steam Engine & dredging
Machinery are now almost entirely worn out & unfit for use. It is
by constant repairs that if can be made to hold out to finish the work.
As the machine & boats can be of no use for any other work I would
recommend that it be sold at auction at Apalachicola where it will
be wanted to fill up their Docks &c with.

It will be remembered by the Department that an experiment was
made to cut off some bends in the Apalachicola river & reported as
unsuccessful. Time has however proved to the contrary as they have
washed away as much as it was thought desirable when the work was
done.

me an estimate be necessary I cannot conceive why it was not sub-
mitted in the usual & customary form.
When Congress have decided that a work shall be executed after it
is actually commenced the estimates go to the Committees of Ways &
Means except for Florida—We have to wait for the improvements
of Georgia or have a sum large enough to deter Congress moved by a
Delegate without the aid of even a recommendation of a Department—
If that estimate had been sent in the first instance it would have
been an easy matter, or if you will now send it in the regular way it
may be granted—There is not a work in the whole union more useful

the boundary of the grant to John Forbes & C° to establish which,
a Suit is now depending in the Supreme Court of the United States,
in the name of Colin Mitchell and others, vs The United States.”
This claim you will discover is founded on a Sale made by the Indians
to the House of John Forbes & C** At the date of this Sale, St
Marks was a regular Fertress Fortress garrisoned by the troops of
Spain. It continued to be occupied as a Military Post, until formally
delivered to the United States as public property under the 2"Article
of the Treaty of 1819.
Perhaps nothing could involve a greater absurdity than the propo-
sition, that the Indians, most of whom inhabited the Territory of
the United States could convey to a company of foreign Merchants,
an extensive body of land within the dominion of Spain, and on
which was situated a Spanish Fortress, then garrisoned by her troops.
To obviate this absurdity the Counsel for the claimants now con-
tend in argument that they do not claim the land within gunshot
from the Fort, although the grant expressly conveys all the land
within its limits without any reservation whatever. This is however,
most evidently, a conclusion formed since the commencement of the
Suit, and since perhaps they found from the facts placed on the
record, they could not maintain their right to the Fortress, and it
might present a most embarrassing feature in the whole claim. That
they did claim it originally, and that they do still claim on the Record
all the land within the limits of the grant, I refer you to the Petition
of the claimants found at page 15 of the printed Record of the case,
in which they say “they are not apprised that any portion of the
land claimed and within the proper boundary of the same as estab-
lished by the said cession of 1811, is held by any title adverse to
their own, unless it be a few Sections or portions, entered or sold by
the United States without a knowledge of the boundary of the Same.”
The land thus refered to in the Petition is situated Six or eight
miles from S' Marks, and is no part of that which the Bill before
Congress authorizes to be sold. But if it were otherwise, it is evident
from the language of the Petition, that it is still claimed as a part
of the grant. The Petition was no doubt intended, and to be good,
must conform to the provisions of the Act of 1824 found at page 872
of Clarks Land Laws.” This act requires a particular designation
of the boundary of the land claimed, and requires the Petitioners to
* See ante, XXIV, 975.
* See ante, XXII, 211, n.

set forth fully and particularly in their petition whether “the United
States be interested on account of the lands within the limits of such
claim, not claimed by any other person than the petitioners.” If
these Petitioners did not intend to claim the land on which the Fort
is situated, and that within gun gun shot from its walls the fact
should have been specified in their Petition. As the record now stands
they do present a claim to this as well as all the rest of the land within
the limits of the grant.
Knowing as I do from mortifying experience the disposition of the
Court to avail itself of every circumstance however remote, or trivial
to sustain the claims against the government, it has occurred to me
that if the Bill should be passed by Congress authorizing the Sale
of the lots at S*Marks, that an argument will be based on this fact,
to show that there was nothing absurd in the Sale of the Fortress
by the Indians and that though the claimants could not take the
Fort and the adjacent land under the Sale, yet the Sale for the resi-
due of the land is good. The reason assigned why they do not claim
the Fort and the adjacent land is, that the Laws of Spain forbid the
Sale or grant of lands to individuals within gun shot of the Fortifi-
cations. That is very true, but that Law is not more imperitive than
the law which directs lands to be granted only in proportion to the
ability of the grantee to cultivate and improve them. It is not more
imperitive than the law which declares that lands shall not be granted
to foreigners who have not taken the oath of allegiance, Nor is it
more obligatory than the law which directs that the land shall not
be granted to individuals on the Sea Ports. Yet these several laws
have all been violated in the present grant.
I have thought it my duty to give you this information, that you
may should you think it necessary, either have the passage of the
law opposed, or have it so expressed as not to effect the interest of
the Government on the trial of the important case now depending
in the Supreme Court. I have not seen the Bill and therefore can
form no opinion on the Subject. I have given you the facts from
which you will be able to form a just conclusion after reading the Bill."

FLORIDA TERRITORY 19
PETITION TO THE DELEGATE IN CONGRESS BY CITIZENS
OF JACKSON COUNTY
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[June 8, 1834]
TO THE HON. JOSEPH M. WHITE–
The undersigned Citizens of Jackson County in the Territory of
Florida, respectfully represent, that under the existing arrangement
of the Post Routes they are without any mail communication with
the adjacent Counties in Alabama with which, from their vicinity,
they are in great need of a direct communication.
The present route extends from Webbville to Campbelton, by which
this section of the Country is Supplied with the Tallahassee Mail
weekly but if we wish to avail ourselves of a mail communication
with the Citizens of the adjacent Counties of Alabama living at a
distance of twenty or forty miles from us, our letters must take a
most unnecessarily circuitous route, either by Marianna, Mt Vernon,
Columbus (Georgia) Montgomery (Ala) or by Pensacola, Blakely
Claiborne & Sparta (Ala). This inconvenience, we earnestly hope
will not much longer exist, as we think it need only to be known to
be remedied. We are satisfied that the Citizens of the Counties of
Henry, Dale, Covington, & Conecuh in the State of Alabama feel
equally anxious as ourselves for a Mail communication, so much
needed by them & us—
By the proposed alteration of the Post Road from Marianna to
Oak Hill now making the Village of Webbville will be deprived of a
mail, or must with us be supplied by a seperate route from Marianna.
In this event we beg leave to suggest as the most judicious arrange-
ment, that the route be extended from Marianna Fl. via Webbville
& Campbellton to Daleville in the State of Ala.
The distance is not greater than fifty five miles from Marianna to
Daleville, & the additional expense of transportation will be but
trifling when compared with the benefits resulting to the Citizens of
West Florida & the adjacent counties of South Alabama.
Permit us therefore to direct your attention to this Subject & to
request that you will take such steps as you may deem necessary to
effect an object so much desired.

SIR, In reply to your letter of the 4th instant," covering a petition
of Messrs: Russ and Roach of Florida," I have the honour to state
that the persons named, with others, engaged to repair the military
road in Florida from Pensacola to Tallahassee, in the manner and
within the time set forth in their contract, of which the paper sub-
mitted with your letter is a correct copy.
In the early part of the spring of 1833 I received information from
various private sources that the labour expended upon the road was
intirely misapplied; and on the 15th of April I received a communi-
cation from the District Attorney of West Florida with a presentment
by the Grand Jury of Washington County of which paper numbered
1 is a copy." Paper No. 2. is a copy of the report of the Officer ordered
to inspect that part of the road complained of."

Papers No. 3 & 4 are copies of reports from Captain S. Shannon

From the latter report it will be seen that they declined appointing
an Inspector when called on to do so. No. 5 is a copy of my instruc-
tions to Captain Shannon directing him to apply the appropriation
to the repair of the road, in the manner which he might think best."
No. 6. Is a copy of a letter of Captain Shannon," with a copy of
an account of Mr. Russ for labor said to have been expended on the
road and for other objects connected with it. These papers contain
all the information which I am able to give on the subject of the
contract.
The contractors having abandoned the work, and failed to appoint
an inspector according to the terms of their contract, when required
to do so, forfeited all legal claim to payment for the labor performed;
and no other course was left to the Department but that which I
directed in my letter to Captain Shannon. I think however a fair
compensation should be made to the Contractors for the labor actually
performed, so far as it was advantageously applied; but Congress
only can authorize it."
I return the petition, Contract and other other papers: and I am,
Sir, &c.

The committee on the Judiciary to whom was referred the Peti-
tiehs memorials of the citizens of the counties of Walton & Escambia,”
praying for an increase of the Salary of the West judge of the Western
District of Florida, respectfully report to the Senate,
That the petitioners, are numerous, seme of thena including the
grand jurors impannelled at the November term of the Superior court
for the County of Escambia, in 1833. The petitioners concur in
representing that the Salary of fifteen hundred dollars is inadequate,
compared with the onerous duties, & travelling to which the judge of
this District is subjected: That at the time the Salary of fifteen hun-
dred dollars was established, the judge was required to hold his the
courts but at two places, the ene at Pensaeela; the ether Pensacola,
and such other place in the District, as should be designated by the
Legislative Council. That by Subsequent acts of Congress, the
Legislative Council have been authorized to compel the judge of this
District to hold courts at such places & at such times as the said
Council should direct: * and in pursuance of that authority the Coun-
cil have required the judge to hold courts twice, in each year, in Six
counties: that another court has been added by Congress & by the
Council,” A court of Appeals, to be holden once a year at Tallahassee,
by all the judges:* That the judge of the Western district, in addi-
tion to the twelve terms of the Superior court in the Six counties,
and the term of the court of Appeals, is compelled to hold two extra
terms, the ehe for the trial of admiralty cases, the one at Pensacola,
the other at Appalachicola; that he is compelled to reside at Pensa-
cola; that Appalachicola, is growing in business & importance, &
promises to become one of the most commercial places on the Gulph
of Mexico: that in travelling from Pensacola to Appalachicola, the
judge is subjected to great charges & risks, by the great distance &
difficulty of passage between these two places; that he is now com-
pelled to travel not less than two thousand miles every year in the
performance of his official duties, which travelling is through a new
country with a population thinly scattered: Moreover they state that

formerly the judges were allowed an extra compensation of eight
hundred dollars per year, each, for adjudicating upon the land claims:
but at the last Session of the Congress, this extra allowance was di-
rected to be continued to two of the judges only, whereby neither the
judge of the Western District, nor any of the other judges, have re-
ceived it, the act not designating which two of the judges should
receive such extra compensation, there being land claims in all the
districts. The petitioners state, that from the labours imposed upon
the Judge, the expenses, difficulties, & distance he has to travel, a
salary of three thousand dollars would be but reasonable.
Your committee is of opinion that the Salary ought to be increased
and according report a bill, “To increase the compensation of the

SIR, When your Contract shall be executed, and your instructions
and Diagram furnished, you will make all the necessary arrangements
to proceed by the first day of October next, to the south boundary
of Township Eleven on May's Meridian, being the line between
Ranges 23 & 24, and run thence a true Meridian south eighteen miles
without regard to that extended by May, marking and posting regu-
larly, and having the same bearing of the principal Meridian at
Tallahassee—When you establish that point, being the south bound-
aries of Townships 14, you will then extend a true parallel East,
having the same bearing as that extended from Tallahassee, until you
reach the Atlantic Ocean, and if obstructed by impassable objects,
you will traverse south round the same by regular and established

Township lines, with their true bearings until you regain the true
point across the obstacle so traversed, and extend as before—The
correctness of these lines must stand the test of the strictest scrutiny;
and your compass and chains must be strictly adjusted with the
office Compass and chain, & afterwards claim your unremitted atten-
tion—You will cause a notice to be published at St. Augustine, and
elsewhere posted, of the probable time and place you will be able to
commence the survey of District C,-after the extension of the Par-
allel is made, which forms the Northern boundary thereof, that all
persons interested may attend with the necessary evidence required,
to have their private Claims laid down, and return a copy of said
notice to this Office with your work when executed—You will com-
mence the surveys in your District on the West, and extend them
to the Atlantic, taking special Care to cause the Range lines to have
the true Meridian bearing, with the important view of having all the
work from the second Parallel south free from all irregularities
The most pointed regard for the interest of the Government and
its Citizens, must be rigidly adhered to; and you are therefore charged
to keep your instructions as your polar star—You will recollect that
I hold it inadmissible to over-run your Contract.—A copy of the Dia-
gram is forwarded to the Keeper of the Archives with a notice to be
published from this Office, independent of the notice required of you—
The Meridian and Parallel contemplated to be run by you forming
the ground work of certain Districts, it will suggest itself to you how
important it is that you should not fail in the execution of the same
in due time.

[NA:ND, SN, Live Oak Letters:ALS]

SIR I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 7" Inst,” together with an extract of the 3"Section of the act for
the gradual improvement of the Navy of the United States “approved
March 2" 1833," and an extract of a letter from Wylie P. Clarke
Esq " late Live Oak Agent to your Department in which Mr Clarke
Says that Maj Clements informed him that “thousands of Live Oak
trees have recently been cut down by trespassers on Public Lands on
St Johns River and on the Atlantic Coast,” and that a private com-
pany there have lately furnished an order for Naval timber to the
amount of $120,000
In reply to which I have to observe that I have made Some enquiry
in relation to this matter and am perfectly Satisfied that Since the
discontinuance of the Live Oak Agency in this District (where my
attention has been more particularly directed to this Subject) or
indeed for Some time before, no considerable number of Live Oak trees
have been cut in East Florida upon any lands public or private.
Of the order for naval timber mentioned by Mr. Clarke I know
nothing; and cannot find a person who has ever before heared of it;
if Such an order has lately been furnished to any person here, I am
very Sure that it has not been filled
In a country where the population is So Sparse as it is in this, and
where the Surveys are necessarily old & the lines consequently difficult

to trace, it would not be extraordinary if persons in procuring Live
Oak timber Should, with the best intentions, occasionally pass the
boundaries of private right, or that a few trees Should be cut on public
lands; but of the Small quantity which has been cut within the last
few years, the greatest part has no doubt been obtained from private
lands the titles to which have been confirmed; or from the principles
Settled by the Supreme Court in the Land Cases taken up by appeal
from our Court and lately decided there) must as a matter of course
be confirmed.
The United States Surveyors have lately Surveyed in this District
as public many tracts of private lands which are embraced in the two
classes above mentioned, those which have been confirmed, because
the proper evidence of that fact was not furnished them; and those for
which claims are now pending in our Court under the acts of 23" May
1828 * and 26th May 1830," which provide for the Settlement of Land
Claims in Florida, because by their instructions they were only author-
ised to Survey as private lands Such as the keeper of the “Public
Archives” would certify had been confirmed
Upon these tracts which were considered & treated by the Surveyors
as public lands, Some Live Oak trees may recently have been “cut
down,” and it was these doubtless, to which Maj Clements alluded;
but it is very Singular that notwithstanding that gentleman while he
was in this District was frequently at my office, and other public
offices, he never once mentioned the facts Stated by Mr Clarke to
myself or (So far as I can learn) to any other officer of the government,
or any one else here.
I Shall make farther enquiry upon this Subject and no pains on
my part Shall be Spared to prevent the committing of trespasses on
the public lands, or to bring offenders to justice.
That no one may plead ignorance of the law I have caused the act
entitled “an Act to provide for the punishment of offences committed
in cutting, destroying, or removing live oak or other timber, or trees
reserved for naval purposes.” approved March 2" 1831”" to be
published in the Florida Herald a newspaper printed in this City."
I was induced to do this in Some measure by the fact, that Several
Saw Mills have lately been put into operation in this District for the
purpose of Sawing lumber for exportation, Some of the proprietors
of which as was reported to me were procuring pine logs from public
lands to Supply their mills; and an idea Seemed to prevail that there

was no law prohibiting the cutting of pine trees on the public lands,
and that it might therefore be done with impunity.
While upon this Subject permit me to Suggest whether it may
not be advisable to charge the marshal of this District with the duty
of protecting the “Public Timber” he has a deputy in almost every
county in the District who must of course be well acquainted with
the Situation of the lands and what is done upon them in his county,
and the marshal must from the nature of his duties; either in person,
or by his Deputies be constantly passing through the country to
Serve process &c. and can better attend to the interests of the govern-
ment in this behalf than any other public officer, and as it would
come in his way; he could afford to do it for a much less compensation
than a Special agent: & besides the District is So extensive that no
one individual can properly discharge this duty, and the interposition
of an agent is So Seldom necessary, that the expediency of keeping
Special agents in constant pay may well be doubted as may the
propriety of leaving this portion of the public property entirely un-
protected.

SIR I herewith inclose my quarterly accounts of disbursements
for improving Apalachicola Harbour for 2" Qr 1834 and a monthly
report of operations of same work for June 1834.
The improvements at Apalachicola have been completed according
to the original plan of them: with a success answering their highest
expectations.” Vessels of all classes that trade to Apalachicola pass
the new channel freely. A Ship from Liverpool passed up to town a
few days since through it.

I perceive by a vote of the House of Reps that the “Harbour Bill”
was laid on the table.” Should this embrace the funds asked for the
St Marks Harbour & River, I would suggest the propriety of requiring
a fund for Apalachicola Harbour to pay to St Marks Harbour &
River the value of the Boats, Machinery &c furnished by the latter
to the former work, which is justly chargeable to it, and that the said
boats &c be also sold for the benefit of the latter work. Had a proper
allowance been made for these fixtures there would have been funds
enough last year to finish the St Marks river to make it boatable for
the last six months. The situation of this river is now such that for
the want of a few Hundred dollars, the amount expended upon it will
be of no avail if nothing more is done. The channel of the river has
washed considerably in debth where it has been worked upon, and but
for some stumps that were left too high and were intended to be cut
lower had the funds held out last year boats could at this time be used
on the whole extent of the river improved—It is estimated that the
surplus fund of the Apalachicola Harbour with the proceeds of the
sales of the boats &c will be sufficient for this service required, as
may be seen by my last annual Report & Estimate.
I hope to be pardoned for this anticipation of a failure to accomplish
an important improvement that has been nearly brought to comple-
tion, and for suggesting “Ways & Means” for it. The interest I feel
in the work impels me to this course.
I will further mention to the Department that I have in a great
measure promoted a scheme for a Rail Road from this place to St
Marks. A Company for which is now formed and about to go into
operation, and I have engaged to serve as Engineer for them provided
my duties were such that I could find time sufficient for it, which
would be the case were they the same as heretofore. This is a work
of the first importance to this country and to get an Engineer from
the north would be too great an expense for the Co. in its present
state: And as I have promoted the work thus far I feel anxious to see
it in progress of construction before leaving the country, I would
therefore request, if I should not be continued here on duty, that I may
be allowed a furlough till Jan. to forward this enterprise."
* This happened on June 20 (House Journal, 23 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 786–787).
The bill was subsequently reconsidered and passed (ibid., p. 819), and approved
June 28, 1834 (4 STAT. 702–704). It embodied an appropriation for the St.
Marks harbor and river.
* Gov. DuVal applied to the Chief Engineer, Apr. 8, 1834 (NA, WD, CE Reg.

Florida and expressed the desire of the citizens that he survey the proposed railroad
route.

it, and the services of all persons attached to it, not authorized by
treaty Stipulations, are discontinued. The duration of your own
agency is limited to the 31st day of December next. This period
was designated under the impression that the removal of the Semi-
noles would commence within the year. No appropriation, however,
having been obtained, all that can be done the present season will be
to make the preliminary arrangements. You will be advised by the
Commissary General of Subsistence, of the measures contemplated
for the fulfilment of the provisions of the treaty, which are connected
with this subject: Meanwhile it is desirable you should return to your
agency, as early and speedily as the state of your health will permit.
The prompt preparation of your accounts, and the Settlement of all
the business of the Superintendency, up to the date of your arrival in
Florida, is indispensable. The Sub-agents have been advised of the
change, as it effected them. Their compensation and duties and the
pay and employment of all others, not sanctioned by treaties, will
cease upon the day of the receipt of that letter of advice. Every
account should be forwarded as early as practicable, and when the
Settlement is completed, the balances that may be due to yourself
or others will be remitted.
Your own compensation is unaltered.
All annuities for Indians will hereafter be paid by Military officers,
designated by the Department.” The annuities for the Seminoles,
and the sums appropriated in fulfilment of treaty provisions, and for
the current expenses of your agency and the Superintendency will
be remitted, with the necessary instructions, when the Department
is informed that you are on your way to Florida.
The duty of investigating the claims against the Seminoles for
Slaves and other property, alledged to have been Stolen by them, and
for the payment of which Seven thousand dollars have been appro-
priated, is entrusted to you. You will proceed to collect and em-
body the evidence of the parties, and report all claims, that in your
opinion ought to be considered as within the intent of the treaty.
You will be allowed your necessary expenses, while performing this
duty, and if the circumstances should seem to demand it, a small
extra compensation."—

SIR, Sometimes in the month of May last I had the honor of de-
positing in the Post Office at Key West, a letter addressed to the
President of the United States;" covering my accounts against the
United States, (certified by the Judge of the Southern District of
Florida) for the Sum of eleven hundred dollars, for services rendered
by me in two land cases pending and decided in the District Court
at Key West. In that letter I took the liberty of saying that as I
proposed visiting my wife's family here, I hoped the President’s
answer would be directed to me accordingly. Permit me Sir very
respectfully to inquire whether my claim is included in the appropria-
tion bill of the present or past year and if so, to what quarter I may
look for payment. I presume his Excellency must have received my
accounts and that he would not have objected to their amount. Be
pleased Sir to answer me at this place and you will confer a great
obligation upon”

DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs, July 21. 1834.
TO CAPT. J. B. F. RUSSELL, U. S. Army, &c,
SIR, I enclose copies of recent Acts of Congress, relating to Indian
Affairs, and of Regulations" for giving them effect. Under the au-
thority vested in the President by the 4th Section of the Act, to pro-
vide for the organization of the Indian Department,” you have been
selected to make the payments for the Seminole and other bands
residing in the Territory of Florida. The Specie annuity due them
amounts to Five thousand dollars; and the further sum of one thou-
sand dollars is payable for the support of a Blacksmith's establish-
ment. You will obtain a draft at the Treasury upon the Bank, which
is nearest and most convenient, for which you will receive specie,
and transport it to the agency by the safest route. You will com-
municate with the Indian Agent Gen' Wiley Thompson as to the
time and place of payment. These will be determined by him, and
he will also make the preparatory arrangements for the payment.
He will obtain the necessary provisions by requisitions upon the
ass' Commissary at Camp King, to an amount not exceeding three
thousand rations. The payments, on account of the Smith's establish-
ments, will be made upon the requisition of the Agent, attached to
an account, receipted by the parties, and attested by himself. The
law prohibits any allowance for your Services, beyond your actual
travelling expenses.
As it is possible, that Gen.' Thompson may not be able to return to
the agency, at the time it shall be necessary to perform the duty herein
assigned you, I have to request, that you then execute his duties,
as prescribed in the Regulations. And that you will take such meas-
ures, as you may deem necessary for the safe keeping of the buildings
of the Agency, and other public property, until his arrival.
You are requested to inform the Commanding Officer at Camp
King of the time and place of payment, that he may be present.
* “Regulations concerning superintendencies, agencies, and subagencies,”
and “Regulations concerning the payment of annuities,” are printed in S. Doc. 1,

COLONEL JAMES GADSDEN, Wascessa, near Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, Not having succeeded in obtaining an appropriation at the last
session of Congress to complete the repair of the road from Pensacola
to Saint Augustine, it will not be in my power, I regret to say, to do
any thing on that important route. I hope to be more successful at
the next Session. It is really extraordinary that Congress should
direct the building of an arsenal in Florida, within a single march of
the Shore of the Gulf of Mexico, and deny the means of opening
avenues to it by means of which only could we defend it in time of war,
or even in peace, in the probable state of the British West Indies.”
With respectful consideration, &c.

To CAPT. J. B. F. RUSSELL, U.S. A. Washington,
SIR, Intelligence, recently received for Gen.' Thompson, induces
the belief, that he may not be able to return to Florida immediately.
It is probable therefore, that it will be necessary for you to assume
more of the duties of Indian Agent, than was contemplated on the
21st instant." That you may be prepared to do so, a personal inter-
view with Gen' Thompson is desirable. You are therefore instructed
to proceed to Elberton in Georgia, the place of his residence. You
will ascertain from him what part of the public business urgently
demands attention, and the best means of accomplishing it; the public
property requiring care, and the best means and agents for securing it.

economical mode of assembling and provisioning the Indians, and
making the payment. If the rations required for the Indians, con-
vened at the payment, cannot be procured from the Commissary's
Stores at Camp King, you will purchase them upon contract, to an
amount not exceeding three hundred dollars.
The accompanying blanks, with the regulations, exhibit the form
in which your accounts and vouchers will be made out. They will be
transmitted to this Office through the Indian Agent.
I enclose an extract of a letter from Col° Gadsden, relative to a
robbery of Blunt, the Appalachicola Chief, alledged to have been
committed by a man named Price.” This man, it is stated by Gen."
Thompson, resides upon the Chatahoochee, near the State line of
Alabama.” He may be sheltered by the Slaves or Indians in the
Territory. I will thank you to made the discovery and apprehension
of this person, a principal object, while you are in the Territory; and
to communicate whatever intelligence you may collect, to the United
States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
The funds for the payments in Florida will be given to you in a
Draft upon Charleston. This Draft you will probably have no
difficulty in cashing at Augusta. You will obtain such kinds of Specie
as you shall learn from Gen.' Thompson will be most acceptable to
the Indians.
You will call upon M* Richards whenever you may require the

suit. And besides this, I give you below the substance of charges
preferred against him while Post Master, which he met by what
amounted merely to a general denial, but which were so far sustained
as to cause and justify his removal.
He was charged with being suspected of an improper agency in the
loss of several sums of money enclosed in letters and deposited in his
office for transmission by mail. That the most respectable merchants
of the place had so little confidence in him that they sent their letters
to be mailed at an office 40 miles distant:—that he had opened a letter
in his office addressed to another person, without authority to do so—
that he was habitually intemperate—that he was suspected of destroy-
ing M" White's report, left at his office, to be sent per mail—that he
charged double postage on single letters, and that he mismanaged
the office generally. And after his removal he held the office in
defiance of his successor, untill after proceedings were taken into
Court, and a special order sent by the Post Master General—conduct
highly improper and reprehensible.

SAMUEL SHANNON TO THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL
[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
PENSACOLA Flo 20* Sept 1834
GENERAL, The bad condition of the mail road between this place
and Blakely induced me, in passing over it lately, to make a mem-
morandum of its present state and the cost of completing or making
it good, and I respectfully beg leave to submit for your consideration
the inclosed estimate for that object"
This road has been cut out and so far completed as to admit of the
travel of the mail coach on it by the mail contractor at his individual
expense, the distance by it from this to Blakely is but 50 miles, being
12% miles shorter than the old road; 17 miles of the distance is within
the Ter” of Flo. the other 33 miles is within the State of Ala but passes
altogether thro. public land
The making or rather the finishing of this road is important to
government on several accounts first for the reason that it is part of the
route of communication between the Mil” Post at this place and that at
Mobile point and between this and the Arsenal at Mt Vernon Ala, it
is also part of the mail route to Washington and the North, as well as
to New Orleans and Mobile and is in that respect important to both
the Mil” and Naval establishments at this Station, and it will at the
same time inhance the value of the public land, thro. which it passes,
to a much greater amount over its present worth than the cost of
making the road
It is desirable to complete this road in preference to repairing the
old one on acct of the distance being so much shortened by it and the
expense will not be much greater than that of repairing the old road
which must be done or it can be no longer used ”

“Straight Channel”, which has been attended with the greatest
Success: So that the vessels of the largest class trading to that place
pass through it to the wharves of the town”—It remains yet to be
determined whether or not it will be necessary to obstruct the other
outlets of the river to throw the water more forcibly into the new one.
Should it be necessary—the funds in my hands will be enough to
construct a boom on the main one to retain the drift-wood and effec-
tually force so much of the water into the cut as not only to keep it
clear but cause it to deepen.
The expenditures upon the St Marks river have been to improve
it by opening a channel to a point about 2 miles South of the St
Augustine road, and it was intended that it should be completed by
this time for barge navigation, but the want of funds last year and the
high waters of the present have prevented—The heavy rains of this
Season have caused the river to rise so as to prevent the possibility of
working in it. The work is therefore suspended for a time
The expenditures in the harbour have been in the preparation of a
diving bell on the plan of my last report made to you; the completion
of which has been retarded by the Sickness of the hands employed to
construct it and the difficulty of procuring others to work. It is now
nearly ready for operation, to be imployed in deepening the cut in the
Devils Elbow; which consists in removing the broken stones, from
blasting, that the dredging buckets could not take up, while the work
was carried on—
The funds available for this improvement as well as at Apalachicola
I deem sufficient for the purposes designated above: and thus I make
no estimate of funds either for a new appropriation or the final com-
pletion of the works, as the present available ones may be taken for the
latter *—

THE ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE TO THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL
[NA:SD, Dom. Lets., xxvil]
Department of State WASHINGTON 20 Oct 1834.
BENJAMIN F. BUTLER Esquire Attorney General of the U.S.
SIR, As there is little hope that the Commissioners appointed for
the purpose of reclaiming the Louisiana and Florida Archives at
Havana will be able to complete the examination of the vast mass of
papers,” from which the selection is to be made, before the next
term of the Supreme Court, it has been thought best to make a direct
and explicit application to the Governor General of Cuba for such
documents as are more immediately required, in reference to the
causes now pending, and of which the decision cannot be delayed
beyond the next winter. This course is adopted, under the idea
that there may possibly be some books or records, within the knowl-
edge and control of the Authorities of the Island which may cast
light upon the disputed titles, and from their containing, or omitting
to contain, the proceedings in relation to the grants, in question,
may afford evidence either of a positive or negative character in
favor of the United States, but which from some cause have not been
submitted to the inspection of the Commissioners. If such should
exist, it is thought that a direct appeal from this Government to the
Captain General may be the means of drawing them forth, and
securing the benefit, if not of the originals, at least of authenticated
copies. Although it must be admitted under a knowledge of the
circumstances which have already expired, in relation to this busi-
ness, that the chance of any favorable result from this application,
is very small, there is yet an unwillingness on the part of the Presi-
dent, that any step should be omitted, which may, by any possi-
bility, elucidate the supposed rights of the Government in these
controverted questions. I have the honor to request therefore, in
order that the intended application may be made, in such manner as
to preclude all doubt or evasion on the part of those to whom it is
addressed, that you will state with as much precision as you can, the
nature and description of the documents for which a demand should
be presented—
It may be proper, at the same time, to mention that it is not in-
tended by this proceeding to interrupt the examination which M"
Robinson has been, for some time, conducting, but that all the papers
selected by him, which may be thought of any consequence, in refer-
ence to the causes alluded to, are expected to be received in this

SIR. The settled determenation of a Majority of the influential

by the Treaty at Paines Landing,” with the temper indulged by them
towards Holate Emartla, as Manifested in Council, added to the
threats which we have heard have been made against him & some

Chiefs and families, in some danger—We are therefore decidedly of

you have suggested to us, that would be afforded to him & others
who are in danger by permitting them to go to the Reserve on Apa-

very important to them it was my duty to give them reasonable
time to make up their minds upon those points, but that when they
should retire to deliberate upon those propositions, to carry with
them the recollection that what I had said to them was in persuance
of instructions from the Government—conformable to the stipula-
tions of their solemn Treaty, and therefore must stand
The succeeding day on their intimation, we again met in council,
when they, through the same Chiefs repeated in substance what they
had said the preceeding day—I expressed to them my regrets that
they should so openly manifest a total disregard of the obligations
of their Solemn Treaty with the United States
They then requested that I as their Agent and friend would give
them my views & opinion upon the subject of their relations with the
United States: in complyance with which I gave in substance what
you have in my second talk herewith inclosed—During the delivery
of my second talk I was frequently interrupted by some of the Chiefs,
especially a leading Chief who was a member of the exploring Deliga-
tion, a circumstance so unusual in an Indian Council as to satisfy
me that they were not only affraid that I would produce a proper
impression on the minds of the Indians, but that they are obstinately
fixed in a resolution to disregard the Treaty of Pains Landing"
While I was pourtraying to them the inevitable & utter ruin which
would overwhelm them were it possible for them to remain in their
present location a fiew Years longer, silence ensued their previous fre-
quent interruptions, they were awe struck by the pictures I presented
to them of utter dessolation and hopeless wretchedness, and their
minds, especially Micoanopas (whom the Indians look to as a prin-
cipal Chief) seemed ingrossed and deeply interested. At that impor-
tant crisis I heard Powell a bold & dashing Young Chief who was
seated by Micoanopa, and who is vehemently opposed to the removal
of the Indians speak to the latter, apparently in much earnestness;
and the Interpreter informed me subsiquently that Powell then urged
Micoanopa to be firm in his resolution—
Holate Emartla, one of the principal Chiefs displayed a magnanim-
ity of character and a nobleness of soul merriting a better fate than
that which I fear awaits him—He was in very bad health, said but
little, but that little was a bold & manly declaration of his deter-
mination to adhere in good faith to his engagements with the United
States, and it was coupled with a reproof upon those who evinced
a disposition to prove faithless. Holate Emartla and Fuckaluste Hajo
one of his confidential Chiefs, are of opinion that their own people

informed me secretly, that their lives were threatened that they
believed themselves & families with some of their people are in danger
and they appealed to me for the protection which would be afforded
to them by permission to visit their friends on the Apalachicola River
under expressed stipulations that they will promptly return to the

when called on by me—This protection I have on mature delibera-
tion determined to afford them when it shall become obviously nec-
essary: but I directed Holate Emartle to be on the look out, stay as
long as he can in safety, as I confidently expect that the Government
will soon enable me to protect him & his people here, which he seemed
delighted to hear. If however he finds himself in great danger before
the much to be desired moment when the Government will have a
sufficient Military force in this section, I have determined to permit
him & such of his people as are in most danger, to occupy the Reserve
on Apalachicola River recently evacuated by Co' John Blunt & his
party there to remain under all existing treaty limitations restrictions
and provisions, until called thence.
You have herewith enclosed a copy of the opinion expressed to me
by Cap" Russell & Graham as to the necessity & propriety of the
permission which I have determined to give to Holate Emartla.”
A full view of all the circumstances leaves me without doubt that
these deluded people have determined to resist the execution of the
Treaty of Pains Landing, and I now have as little doubt that this
delusion has been induced by some of the causes of hostility to emi-
gration suggested in my Report to the Superintendant of Indian
Affairs in Florida, dated the 1" of January 1834 *—There are many
very likely Negros in this Nation: Some of the Whites in the adjacent
settlements manifest a restless desire to obtain them; and I have no
doubt that Indian raised Negros now in possession of the Whites—
some of the Negros in the Nation, with some of the Indians, have
been induced by bribery or other wise, to stir up hostility among
the Indians to the intended emigration, for the purpose of detaining
the Negros here until the Territorial Jurisdiction shall be extended
over the Indian country so as to enable fraudulent Claimants to
prosecute their claims in the Territorial Courts: Or in the general

scramble which [may grow out of a worse state of things give] "the
avaricious & unprincipled an opportunity to effect their object by
some other means—
It could not have escaped observation that the Indians after they
had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of
Powder & Lead—I saw one Kegg of Powder carried off by one Chief,
and I am informed that several whole Keggs were purchased. I did
not forbid the sale of those articles to the Indians, because as such
a course would have been a declaration of my apprehensions, it might
produce a sudden and immediate eruption—It may be proper to add
that I was heretofore informed that the Chiefs have a deposite of
Forty or Fifty Keggs of Powder, which I did not credit at the time.
Having thus given you a full view of the existing state of things
here, I feel it an imperious duty to urge the necessity of a strong
re inforcement of this Post, and the location of a strong force at
Tampa Bay, as early as possible—An imposing force thus promptly
marshaled to coerce these refractory people will have the effect to
crush the hopes of those who have been tampering with them—awe
the Chiefs into a proper respect for the Government—Afford protec-
tion to the neighbouring white settlements, and superceede the neces-
sity of Holate Emartla & his followers fleeing the country—
I was informed that it has been usual to make presents to the
Indians during the payment of the Annuity—I did not feel myself
authorized to pursue the custom, and therefore declined doing so—I
did however distribute among them a small quantity of Tobacco, an
article as indispensible in their estimation almost, as provisions—
In pursuance of your instructions, I am desirous to close the busi-
ness of my Superintendency of Indian Affairs in Florida—I cannot
however accomplish this object until I receive the requisite funds—I
did anticipate the arrival here of the funds necessary to effect this
object some time ago but owing I presume to the want of Mail facili-
ties, I have not received from your Department any communication
of a later date than the 6" of August last"—
I have commenced the settlement of the business of the Superin-
tendency as instructed, up to the date of my arrival here, which was

To that date Cap" Russell on my requisition paid the Striker in the
Seminole Smithery—Eben Beale, the Black Smith whom I left em-
ployed, abandoned the Shop on the 5" of May last—He was con-
sequently only paid to that date, at which time Capt Graham em-
ployed a Slave belonging to the Suttler here, M Erastus Rogers, to
supply Beales place until I should return to the Agency—This Slave
was employed because a white man could not be obtained who could
be relied on—Since my arrival I have sought to employ a white man
as Gun & Blacksmith, but fear I shall not be able to obtain one in
this Country who can be relied on. The Slave now engaged is a good
Smith; And I submit to you whether I shall continue him—On my
arrival here I found the Striker indulging in intemperance and I dis-
charged him Cap" Graham furnished me with a man from the Can-
toonment to aid in the Smithery during the Assemblage of the Indians
when there is always much work required to be done—I promised
the man some compensation for his service—I have tried to obtain
an Indian to serve as Striker and failed, and have been as unsuc-
cessful in my application to the Whites—If permited I will continue
M Rogers Smith, and employ an intelligent Slave in the adjacent
white settlements who hires his time of his owner and is desirous to
undertake as Striker—I can controul these men should they be em-
ployed and submit the subject to you because I am aware of the
policy which justifies the regulation that requires the employment of
white men when Indians competent to perform the Service cannot be
found—The compensation due to Erastus Rogers for the services of
his Smith from the 5" of May to the 30" of September last, was not
paid, because M* Rogers is absent and left no person duly authorized
to sign a receipt
The existing state of things here has brought me to the conclusion
that it will be proper for me to remain at the Agency, and receive here
the claims against these Indians provided for by the Treaty of Pains
landing, the adjustment of which has been commited to me
I herewith inclose to you an estimate of all balances within my
knowledge due from the Government to this Superintendency with
the exception of the claims for salary & expenses in favour of the late

JOHN RODMAN TO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
[NA:SD, Misc. Letters:LS]
Collector's Office, S*AUGUSTINE, 4* November, 1834.
SIR, I beg you to excuse the liberty I take, in addressing a few words
to you, on the subject which I consider as proceeding from the negli-
gence and inattention of the Marshal of this District in his official
duties.
He has a very fine room in our new Court Hall, in which his office
is kept; but it is the last place in this city to find him or his Deputy,
at the usual hour of business. His office is shut and no person in it,
either in the forepart of, or afternoon of the day, unless he be acci-
dentally there.
This is a real inconvenience, often important to members of the bar.
He has a very good Deputy, and when obliged to leave his office on
business, it appears to me that his Deputy should be found in it.
But in fact, not one time in twenty, has he any occasion to leave his
office on business. It must proceed from sheer idleness. His office
hours need be only from 9 o'clock in the summer and 10 o'clock in the
winter until 2 o'clock, our dinner hour in this country; and not at all
after dinner.
* Answered by the Secretary of War, Nov. 24, 1834 (NA, OIA, Lets. Sent,
Bk. 14), expressing disapproval of the demands made by the Indians. He en-
closed a speech to the Seminole chiefs (present, dated Nov. 22, 1834) in which he
accuses them of dishonor and states that the President will not listen to their
demands. See also the Adjutant General to Clinch, Nov. 24, 1834, (NA, WD,
AGO Lets. Sent, Bk. 11), enclosing General Order No. 72 (loc. cit., General Orders,
Bk. 6) which ordered units of the second and third artillery regiments to the
vicinity of the Seminole villages. Clinch's acknowledgment was dated at Fort
King, Dec. 24, 1834 (loc. cit., Lets. Recd., C 551).

I have not the least personal objection to Mr. Blair, our marshal.
He is a very polite and amiable man, and faithful in his attention
to business placed in his hands; except the difficulty to catch him at
his office, to put business in his hands, or to examine papers in his
office.
As his appointment is from the United States, no Territorial author-
ity can regulate the discharge of his official duty, nor does our judge of
the Superior Court conceive that he can make any rules respecting it.
The Clerk of our Superior Court is equally negligent, in attending
at the usual hours of business in his office. But our judge of the
Superior Court, if he see fit, can himself order a remedy of that evil,—
In truth, I am sorry to say, it is a prevalent vice in public offices in
this country

SIR. An Act of Congress was passed at the last Session authorizing
the survey and laying out of a Town at St Marks in the Territory of
Florida; and the disposing of one half of the Lots in the Same *—As
this act originated in the Solicitude expressed by this community on
the subject; I may be excused, I trust, in conveying to you the con-
tinuation of that solicitude as to its early execution—The interests of
the Middle District of Florida have been very much affected for the
want of a Commercial Depot and a home market for the produce of
the Country—Nature pointed out the site of the Old Fort of St Marks
as the most eligible; but the peculiar situation in which it was placed
precluded the possibility of obtaining such an individual right to
property as would justify improvements on the premeses—The old
buildings of the Fort have been occupied as Store houses &c untill

they have become no longer tenantable, and our Planters generally
in the disposing of their crops have been subjected to tributes, and
embarrassments, which the growth of a Town at a site so favourable
as that of St Marks can alone remove—These considerations induced
many of them, and the undersigned among the number, to urge upon
our Delegate and Congress the necessity of an act similar to that
which was passed the last Session—The Legislative branch of our
Government having listened to our Memorials, we have only to look
to the Executive for the consummation of the benefits of the law
passed in our behalf—May I again invite your attention to this
subject; with a hope that the Surveyor General of this Territory may

SIR, I have the honor to submit for your consideration a letter
dated the 7" inst. from General Gadsden of Florida in relation to the
sale of part of the lots in the Town of St. Marks," and have to state
in relation thereto, that by the Act of the 30" of June last,” you
are authorized to direct the Land Officers at Tallahassee to offer one
fourth of the lots in that Town at public sale, according to the plan
made out by the Surveyor General, but that as the site of that Town is
understood to be embraced by the large claim of Innerarity & others
now pending for decision before the Supreme Court of the United
States, it was my opinion that no sales should be made until that claim
was finally disposed of, and I now beg leave to request your directions
whether any measures shall be taken under those circumstances to
carry the provisions of the Act into immediate operation.
I am &c.

few lines on the subject, as I am in some measure bound to interest
myself for the Commercial welfare of our own people.—
You are probably aware that Indian Key is a small Island—70
miles or thereabout from Key West containing about 10 or 12 acres—
almost an entire rock—the principal rendezvous for the wrecking ves-
sels.—There are about 150 people residing upon it, all more or less
connected with the “wrecking-business”,-which is the only one in
which they can engage.—The place offers no facilities for trading,
excepting to a very limited degree, and unless they get our Admiralty
Court removed thither, they cannot expect to have any importations
from Foreign Ports even if their request should be granted, unless
the inhabitants should think proper to import West India Produce
to the amount of their own consumption.—
I do not know what reasons may have been advanced by the appli-
cants, but it is evident to us that the measure is aimed at the pros-
perity of Key West:—the supposition obtaining, that if able to get
the Key made a Port of Entry it will be a stepping stone towards
the removal thither of the Admiralty Court from Key West; and that
then the entrance, adjudication &c of wrecks will be all within them-
selves—That such regulations may be necessary some years hence is
not impossible, but they are not certainly at present, as every facility
is granted the people there they can possibly require consistent with
propriety & the laws, by having an officer of the Customs stationed
there who grants permission for landing of Merchandise out of Coast-
ing vessels; and is permitted to execute other duties not strictly in
the line of his functions as an Officer of the Customs, but which under
the peculiar circumstances of the place the nature of their trade &c
I consider proper should be left discretionary with him.—I hope this
statement of mine will have some weight with you for I assure you,
constituting Indian Key a Port of Entry—will be a most unpopular
measure here.—
You must pardon me, if before concluding—I diverge from public
concerns to those of a private nature—My commission expires in
January—and my application for renewal is on file at the Depart-
ment—Should there be other applicants for the office you probably
know it and if in that case, you will consult with my Father-in-law,
Mr. Parker of New Jersey, -upon what will be best for my interests,
I shall consider it another obligation added to those already received

SIR, I have received your letter of the 1st instant,” on the subject
of the reported unwillingness of the Seminoles to remove West of the
Mississippi—I agree fully with you in your views on the subject. I
have not the least doubt but that the arrangement with them was
fairly made and fully understood. I know by experience how easily
the Indians are induced by the representations of interested men to
delay their own engagements and to determine upon a course utterly
irreconcilable with their promises and their welfare.
The views you have taken as to the proper measures to be adopted
meet my entire concurrence. And you will see by the enclosed Copies
that the course indicated by you had already been determined upon
by this department. I trust that the orders given will be found suf-
ficient to obviate the difficulty. It is due to the important part that
you had in the negotiation that full information on the subject should

The Negro man Jim alluded to in the letter is believed to have
great influence over his Master Old Vacca Perhassic, for which reason
I took a great deal of pains to impress Jims mind favourbly upon the
subject—I think there is no doubt that Econchattee Micco & his band
will go whenever Vacca Perhassic shall consent to do so—Shall I visit
them for the purpose of effecting their removal? They may be dis-
posed to follow Blunt to Texas—Blunts Wife is a Daughter of Vacca
Perhassic: or they may prefer to surrender their reserves in terms of
their Treaties—should they be disposed to follow Blunt they will of
course it is to be presumed, expect a liberal allowance for a relinquish-
ment of all claims within and upon the United States—If they prefer
to surrender their reserves in Terms of the Treaty, and emigrate to
Arkinsas, it is barely possible that they may insist upon some allow-
ance in addition to the sums stipulated by their Treaties (Three thou-
sand dollars for each reserve) for such surrender: And I suggest this
bare possibility for the purpose merely of submiting to the Secretary
of War whether it would not in such an event be advisable to add a
small sum—if found indispensible—for the purpose of effecting a
total removal of all the Indians from this Territory
Should it be thought advisable to intrust me me with the duty of
makeing the attempt to effect the object of their removal, please fa-
vour me with full instructions upon the subject—If the information
afforded by M. Richards may be relied on I submit to you that there
should be no delay

Ocklawaha in East Florida"—I do not find the Estimate on file
which you request; and I have no means of ascertaining the sum
necessary to accomplish the work; but I think ten thousand dollars
would be as much as could be judiciously expended during the next
season, and perhaps that sum would be sufficient to remove every
obstruction. So long as the Seminole Indians remain in East Florida,
troops will be required at Fort King; and the most convenient and
least expensive avenue through which to supply that post would be
the Ocklawaha, if properly improved.”

SIR, Enclosed you will receive a copy a letter from M* Ming on
the subject of M Levy's claim forwarded that you may be in posses-
sion of all the facts of which I have any knowledge of—Seeing the
advertisement of sale of certain lots in the Town of S’ Marks," I take
the liberty to suggest for consideration the following—When I was
instructed to make the plan of said Town I was only authorized to
survey the exterior: and a question arises in my mind, whether the
lots will sell unless regularly surveyed and staked, and I would strenu-
ously recomend that the sale be made of the fourth part, on the South
in a compact form; thereby securing their sale beyond any question,
and hereafter enhancing the value of the remainder—These sugges-
tions are given for your consideration—I again beg to be put in
possession of the funds necessary to meet the liquidation of the work
expected to be returned by M. Washington and should you determine
to have the scite of S’ Marks regularly surveyed the whole amount
heretofore requested in addition to the small amount on hand, will
not be more than sufficient for current purposes—
I request your early attention to these subjects and remain Very

To COL” ROBERT BUTLER,
SIR, I have just returned from the place called the “Water Pens”
but did not survey Levy's claim;—M' Charles Waldron went with
me but could not shew the beginning or identify the claim so as to
enable me to make the survey—it seems that it was surveyed in 1819,
the following is an extract from the certificate of the surveyor—“I
hereby certify that I have measured and laid off for Don Juan de
Entralgo, notary of Government and the Royal Domain in this City
a piece of land which contains 1000 acres, situated to the south east
of the Savannah of the deceased chief of the Seminoles Known as
Bowlegs and part on a lake by the side of which the said Bowlegs
had a cow pen. The first line of the said land begins at a [blank]
marked X and runs South 12° West, Seventy chains and seventy one
links, and ends at a pine marked X”. Now the Grant calls for the
“Water Pen” about 2 miles south of the Lake, the Survey calls for.
M" Waldrons could not shew any part of the old line and gave it
over until M. Levy came.
The Survey of the grant is made on the South side of the Lake
called for in the survey. The reason I have alluded to the Original
Survey, is that if I ever should be Called on again to make the survey,
I should be glad to hear from you on the subject, as the old Survey
and calls of the Grant do not agree. I think I have done my duty
as a Deputy Surveyor about that claim—
On the opposite side of this leaf you will find a copy of the notice
delivered to Charles Waldron, as agent of M Levy. I shall leave
here in a few minuets for my District and would be glad never to hear
of M Levy and his claim again. Two of my hands are sick

GOVERNOR EATON TO DELEGATE WHITE
[NA:TD, ST Lets. from Judges, Marshals, Attys.:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE 16. De" 1834
DEAR SIR. The present plan of discharging the claim of the Legis-
lative Counsel is very objectionable. The small amount due to each
member occasioning the necessity of seperate drafts and seperate cer-
tificates by the governor imposes it seems to me a very unnecessary
trouble. Wher'fore may not the Sec of the Treasury alter this?
Much incovenience will be saved, if he would direct the appropria-
tion to be placed in the Union or Central Bank of this place to the
credit of the governor; and for cautions sake, make the same to be
drawn out upon the check of the Secretary approved by the governor;
or either being absent, upon the check of one of them. Please bring
this to the consideration of the Sec. The Legislative council is shortly
to meet, and the proposed arrangement will be matter of much con-
venience to the members. -
An act of Congress passed 18 June sec 4 says “the expenditure
of the Legislative Council for pay, mileage, printing & incidental
expenses shall not exceed $7,000.” " But in the Civil list appropria-
tion passed afterwards (27 June) there are appropriated $9.173."
Now which will the Secretary be directed by. The first sum will
not answer, as you will perceive by referring to the estimate I sent
you by the last mail. That estimate proposes $10.305; & in it there
is nothing new I believe expect $300 proposed for a Messenger
Why it it, that every Bureau office at Washington is allowed some
one to clean the rooms—make fires, go to the po. office and take

care of things, & the same thing be refused to the governor of a ter-
ritory. After a short time Florida, it is probable will be the only
one remaining.
A clerk to keep the records up is necessary; and the Council by
appropriating from their funds $400 have admitted the necessity.
But the Council may discontinue this; and withal no qualified young
man can be obtained for that sum; It is practacable to obtain some
young man, who pursues other business, & occasionally gives his
attention to our records tho not exclusively. If Congress would give
a clerk at $800 the records might then be properly kept up, which
heretofore has not been strictly the case "-

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY STOCKHOLDERS OF THE
TALLAHASSEE RAILROAD COMPANY
[NA:SF, 23 Cong., 2 sess.:DS*]
[Referred December 16, 1834]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress Assembled.
The Petition of the undersigned stock holders in the Tallahassee
and S*-Marks Rail Road Company respectfully represent.
That Your Petitioners under a charter obtained from the Legisla-
tive Council of Florida, aided alone by their own resorces, have en-
gaged in an enterpise to construct a Rail Road from Tallahassee to
S. Marks in the said Territory. S. Marks was delivered by the
Commissioner of the Spanish Government to the Commissioner of
the United States under the treaty of 1819 as public property. That
the land at and ajoining to that place belongs to the Government
of the United States. That the old Fort of S. Marks has long since
been abandoned by the Government as a Miletary Post and is now
in a state of delapidation and ruin. That the said Fort was erected
by the Government of Spain in the Year 1759 as a defence against
the neighbouring Indian Tribes, and is not calculated either by its
position or its structure to defend the Bay and Harbour of S’ Marks

against an approach by Sea. That neither the Old Fort or the situa-
tion on which it stands can ever be advantageously used by the
Government as a place of defence, as will more fully appear from
the report of the Engineer Lieu' G W Long hereunto annexed.”
Your Petitioners further represent that the land ajoining the Old
Fort of S. Marks for the Distance of near one mile is an impenitrable
Marsh except where it has by artificial means been elevated for the
Construction of Roads or other purposes. That the grater part of it
is covered with water at every high tide and that without great labour
and expence it can not be appropriated to any use whatever. That
although in its present condition it is of no value, yet by the successful
enterprise of your Petitioners in the constructing a Rail Road to ter-
minate at that Point and the facility it will afford for the transporta-
tion of earth to fill up the Marsh, and elevate the ground above the
flowing of the tide, the said land will become valuable and an im-
portant acquisition to Your Petitioners.
Your Petitioners further represent that some of their fellow Citi-
zens, with great labour and expence have ditched and elevated a small
portion of the ground near the Old Fort, on which they have erected
warehouses and other buildings. Wherefore Your Petitioners pray
that after granting to each of said individuals one lot of ground to be
surveyed in such manner as to give to each the benefit of his improve-
ments as near as practible consistant with the future convenience of
the place." That Congress may be pleased to grant to the Talla-
hassee and S' Marks Rail Road Company one hundred acres of land
embraced in the following boundries (to wit Commenceing at low
water mark at the Point of confluance of the Rivers S* Marks and
Waccolla and entering up the Margin of said Rivers, untill by a direct
line from one River to the other there will be included the number of
acres as aforesaid according to the plat herewith exhibited
And your petitioners further pray that Congress may be pleased to
grant to the said Company the land on which the said Road may be
located and for the distance of one hundred yards on each side thereof,
so far as the same may pass though the lands of the United States"

PRESENTMENT OF THE GRAND JURY OF ST. JOHNS
AND MOSQUITO COUNTIES
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 2 sess.: AC *]
[December 20, 1834]
SUPERIOR COURT-EAST FLORIDA
Extracts from the Presentments of the Grand Jury for the Counties
of St. Johns and Mosquito at the June Term 1834–
The Grand Jury further present that the final completion of the
inland Steam Boat Navigation from the Northern to the Southern
and Western States has long been regarded by every enlightened and
patriotic citizen as a desideratum in the history of our country adding
link to link to the chain which binds in one common bond the varied
interests of this great confederacy giving fresh impulses to the enter-
prise of the capitalist, the speculations of the Merchant, and the
industry of the Agriculturist—In adverting to these improvements
the necessity of a further appropriation being made to complete
inland navigation from St: Marys to St Johns River, presses with
irresistable force on the minds of all capable of appreciating its advan-
tages; the Steam Boat now running between Savannah and St: Johns
river being under the necessity of passing from the Bar of St Marys
to that of the St: Johns by Sea in consequence of the obstacle adverted
to—The opening of a water communication from the cities of Charles-
ton and Savannah by the St: Johns six mile creek and the Matanzas
river to Cape Florida Key West and the Spanish and British posses-
sions would prove it is believed to the commercial interests of this
union a blessing more widely felt than the influence of that great canal
the fame of which has covered the remains of its great projector with
imperishable honor;” To effect this great object a distance of twenty
three miles only at intermediate points require to be cut.
The Grand Jury having learnt that the proprietor of the Steam
Boat Florida now running as a Packet between Picolata on the river
St: Johns and the city of Savannah, touching at all the intermediate
places are anxiously to procure the contract for carrying the mail of
the United States from Savannah to this City, and being apprised
that much additional speed would thereby be given to the conveyance
of the mail by means of such Steam Boat, the mail being brought
to this place at least two days sooner than it now is, and having also
understood that the proprietors of the said Boat will the event of

their procuring the carriage of the mail continue the trips of the said
Boat during the whole year, thereby causing, as it naturally must,
much travelling, to and from this city, and finally as the Grand Jury
think tending directly to the establishment of the main travelling
route through this country from the north to new orleans. They
therefore think that every aid should be given to that enterprising
company as a means of accelerating the conveyance of the mail, and
as a step in the promotion of so important an object.
And they further present that the repairs of Fort Marion, and the
continuation of the Sea Wall of the city of St: Augustine has hereto-
fore been repeatedly urged *—The importance of completing a
Barrier to protect this ancient city from the inroads of the Ocean,
cannot be overlooked; and we rely on the exertions of our Delegate
to obtain from Congress that aid which alone can save our city, when
visited by storms, from unundation and ruin-
They further present, that the United States Bridge across St:
Sabastian Bridge Creek, and the causeways, leading thereto, are in
an incomplete state, and they indulge in the hope that congress will
make further appropriation for the completion of this work, and pass
some needful law for its permanent preservation—as also that the
road from Matanzas to New Smyrna is impassable for a horse, and
that the mail has to be carried for a distance of thirty miles on foot,
the Bridges and Flats having been burnt by the Indians setting fire
to the Marshes; and recommend the erection of a Bridge across Tomo-
ka Creek, as being more convenient and less liable to accident, than
the Flat formerly kept at that Ferry.
The Grand Jury further present, as an evil requiring the attention
of the Government, the present neglected and unexplored state of
that portion of this Peninsula lying South of the 29th degree of
Latitude, which, while it forms in all probability the most valuable
division of the Territory, has become a source of injury to its best
interests, by affording a refuge for runaway slaves, and for bands of
Indians of bad character, who are there beyond the reach of civil
prosecution, and the control of the Agents of the Government. We
consider as a circumstance operating greatly to the disadvantage of
East Florida, that the resources of so large a division of its Territory
comprising a soil and climate, which, (from information obtained
through casual explorers and other indirect channels) are in the
highest degree valuable, are suffered to remain undeveloped and
unexamined, while it forms an obvious opprobrium to the General
Government, that so extensive a portion of its domain, lying in the
immediate vicinity of the Atlantic States, and forming the most

exposed frontier of the Union, should be allowed to continue in this
obscure and neglected condition—
It is believed that valuable stores of Live Oak and other Naval ma-
terials exist in this region; which are daily abducted or destroyed with-
out the Knowledge of the Government; and that the Revenue Laws
are often contravened or evaded by the facility offered for smuggling
and other infractions of the Regulations of the Government in this
remote and unguarded portion of our Maritime Frontier. They there-
fore respectfully recommend that the proper authorities of the Terri-
tory proceed without delay to bring this important subject to the par-
ticular notice of the General Government, who, it is most anxiously ex-
pected, may be induced to order a Military expedition to be fitted out
for the purpose of examining into, and completing the Geography of
this interesting portion of East Florida, Further that three citizens
of suitable information, and residents of this Territory shall ac-
company said expedition, for the purpose of acquiring a full knowledge
of the Agricultural resources of that country.
The Grand Jury concur with the Sentiments set forth in the present-
ments of the Grand Jurors of Duval county generally, and particu-
larly as relates to the Salaries of the Judges of the Superior Courts of
this Territory, as being inadequate to the high laborious and re-
sponsible duties which they are required to perform, and also regret
to learn that the additional sum of eight hundred dollars allowed to the
Judge of this District for his extra services in the Settlement of Land
claims is still withheld from him *—

ELBERT HERRING TO WILEY THOMPSON
[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 14]
DEPARTMENT OF WAR, Office Indian Affairs, December 23, 1834.
TO GENERAL, WILEY THOMPSON, Seminole Agency, Florida.
SIR, I have received your letters of the 2nd ins** with one from the
Interpreter, Richards.
I transmit a copy of the Treaties with the Appalachicolas,” and ask
your attention to their provisions. You will perceive that these trea-
ties present three alternatives to the Indians.
1. If under the 2nd article they remain upon their reservations, the
United States will withdraw their protection, as soon as the Seminoles
and Blunts band have emigrated. During this period, the United
States will pay to them their proportion of the annuity of 5000$, se-
cured by the treaty of Camp Moultrie, and the balance of this annuity
for its unexpired term, when this period is closed.
2. If they sell their lands under the 2nd Article and remove to
Arkansa, at any time prior to the completion of the removal of the
Seminoles, them they must pay, from their private resources, all the
expenses of their migration and subsistence.
3. If under the 2nd Article they surrender within the same period,
their reservations to the United States and join the Creeks and
Seminoles, in Arkansa and give up the treaty made with themselves,
the United States will pay them Three thousand dollars for the reser-
vation granted by the 2nd Article, and extend to them all the bene-
ficial provisions of the treaty of Payne's Landing, a copy of which is
enclosed.
These three propositions of the treaties are distinct and intelligible,
and the Department cannot vary them.
If they follow Blunt to Texas, then the United States will be bound
by the first proposition, to pay the annuity as there stated, and
nothing more.
No provision is made by the treaty, for a surrender to the United
States and a union with Blunt in Texas. If they surrender to the
United States, and join the Seminoles in Arkansa and relinquish the
treaty made with themselves, then the 3rd proposition as above
Stated, will be binding upon the United States and upon them.
You are requested to explain these treaties to the Indians, that they
may understand all that it is in the power of the Government to do
for them.
I am &c.,
ELBERT HERRING.

[December 30, 1834]
Report
The Committee on the Territories to whom was refered the petition
of the inhabitants of Appilachicola praying for a court at that place"
Report—
That this town is situated at the mouth of the River of the same
name, in the present District of West Florida and is rapidly increasing
in population and Commerce—
It appears that they have not had a Court for Eighteen months, &
that it will be impossible for the Judge who resides at Pensacola to
hold the regular Courts at this place, situated as it is at the distance
of 400 miles from the former place—
The Committee for the purpose of obtaining information invited
the Delegate from Florida to come before them in the hope that some
modification of the Districts might be made to avoid this expense of
another Tribunal—They learn that this is impracticable—
Pensacola is the rendevous of the West India Squadron. The Court
there has the powers of a Circuit & District Court of the U States—It

The District of West Florida after this new District is created will be

It has an extensive Foreign & Coast wise navigation Ships near 40
thousand Bales of Cotton which in a few years the Committee are as-
sured will amount to 100 thousand—

constructed Mills, and various other valuable improvements, situ-

adjacent River, Black Water,-that for the distance of two or three
miles above the junction, the former stream is not adapted to the
purposes of Navigation necessary for their Business and the con-
venience of the neighborhood—They therefore have contemplated
constructing a Canal to unite with the River, in the aforesaid dis-
tance—The line of which Canal must pass Eastwardly through parts
of three Sections of Public Lands (viz Sections 3. 4. & 5 of Range
28–Township 1 north & west) and a large part of this Land they
would be compelled to purchase, in order to Secure the benefit of this
improvement—Thereby involving themselves in an additional expence
of one thousand Dollars or thereabouts, which would in no way
benefit them, as the whole of said Lands is of the poorest kind of flat
Sandy Soil, & Swamp, and not convertible to any uses whatever—

their use & benefit, so much only of the Public Land aforesaid, as may
be barely necessary for the cut of the Canal and its banks, to say
Eighty feet in width or thereabouts, (embracing an equal portion of
that space on each side of the centre line of the Canal) for its whole
extent thro the public lands, as before designated—
They feel confident in the assurance and pledge, that the passage
of this canal thro the public lands will not in any way prejudice their

at this time nor ever has been any Settler nor improvements on the

SIR I have just returned from an excursion through the Seminole

purpose of consulting with Maj. Zantzinger” the Officer in Command
there, as to the measures (in cooperation with the Post at Fort King
and this Agency) necessary to effect the objects of the Government—
Having determined by the aid of the Military, to restrain the Indians
from passing without their boundary, as far as practicable; and there
having been but one trading house in the Nation; and that located
near the Northern boundary of the Nation, it was due to the southern
section of the Nation to afford them an opportunity to obtain con-
veniently, supplies of provisions and goods suited to their wants. To
effect this object, and remove a plausible pretext for those Indians
passing without their boundary I Licenced William G. Sanders of
Tampa, to locate a Trading house at the Bridge across the big Hills-
borough river, on the public road leading from Fort King to Tampa;
and took his Bond in terms of the late Act of Congress reorganizing
the Indian Department.

HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN HEATON (Confidential)
SIR. It has been suggested to me that an attempt (perhaps a deter-
mined effort) will be made during the pending Session of the Legisla-
tive Council of Florida, to subject the Seminole Indians to the juris-
diction of the Territory. It is confidently believed that the object is
the accomplishment of a fraud on these Indians. There are many
likely Negros now in the possession of these people, to a considerable
portion of which, there are conflicting claims. Some of these claims
are hopeless, unless the Indian laws and Indian testimony can be re-
pelled. If the jurisdiction of the Territory should be extended over
the Indian Country; and the contest waged in the Territorial Courts,
the object in view will be effected. Hence the effort (should it be
made) to subject these people to Territorial jurisdiction. Your Ex-
cellency knows that the laws of Congress, and the regulations of the
War Department predicated upon those laws, requires a submission
of all claims against Indians to their resident Agent; and by him to be
reported to that Department. The claims I allude to are with held—
it is believed—for the purpose of accomplishing by the aid of the Terri-
torial jurisdiction, what the claimants who are sensible of the injustice
of their claims, cannot hope to effect, by a submission of their claims
to a fair—to the regular & legal test. You are apprised, no doubt, of
the extremely delicate state of our present relations with these people—
If the interposition which I thus deprecate, should be attempted, it

To the Honorable the Senate & House of Representatives of the U States

The undersigned, Merchants and others of the Island of Key West

Pensacola Apalachicola Tampa Bay & S' Marks, and also on their
return voyages—All masters of vessels acquainted with this passage
now avail themselves of it; rather than go round the Tortugas as it
shortens the passage about one hundred & fifty miles—
The number of vessels passing through this passage are now very
great, but there is a general complaint on the part of navigators of
the want of a light, at the entrance of the passage for their govern-
ment in bad weather when pilots are most wanted and when they

far I may be authorised to interfere with the Survey already executed
without instructions from the Treasury and a copy of the decree by
him alluded to, does not admit of much doubt on my part.
The other Case refered to, ineludes involves a difficulty of much

Congressional provision. One other case of M* Levy's at what is
called the “Water Pen” not mentioned in his letter but which has
been the Subject of Correspondence between us, I hope will be ar-
ranged at last without much difficulty. He has promised to identify
the beginning as Contemplated by the Grant, and as that instrument
has not given any Calls either of Courses and distances, and as the

TALLAHASSEE Jan' 18" 1835
SIR Agreeably to your directions I make the following “detailed
report” on the works of improvement entrusted to my charge in this
part of the Territory of Florida–
My first duties were on the improvement of Apalachicola river for
which there was $8.000.00 appropriated in 1831.” This work was
carried on during that year, by clearing the river of logs & rafts that
had lodged in it, and the banks of heavy timber where it was liable
soon to fall in and afford new obstructions to the Navigation.—In the
Summer of 1832 this part of the improvement was brought to a close
and in the following Session of Congress, by a Survey & Estimate of
mine, an appropriation of $7.500 was made for a new & Straight chan-
nel from St. Georges Sound to the town of Apalachicola.” This im-
provement was to Save a circuitous route of about six miles from the
Sound to the town by a Straight cut of about 1% miles, and also to
acquire a greater debth of water than was there had. The work was
carried on in 1833 & 1834 by a dredge boat and has been attended with
the greatest success, so that a full rigged Ship passed up to town
through it, within a week after it was completed. These works thus
far have been attended with useful results, with which I am well
satisfied—There is a small balance unexpended of these appropriations
still in my hands—
At the commencement of the year 1832 I was directed by you to take
charge of the improvement of the St. Marks river & harbour,” at
which time the work in the harbour had been commenced with a
dredge boat & apparatus to deepen & Straighten the channel. The
space of the harbour that required this improvement was about two
miles: intercepted with oyster bars and mud Shoals. The only diffi-
cult place of this work was in cutting through an oyster bar at the
Devils Elbow, where a Stratum of rotten limestone was found but

seven feet below water level at high tide. The plan adopted to deepen
the channel through this cut of about 100 yards in length was to blast
the stone by means of canisters of powder with tubes to come out of
water which were adjusted in holes drilled for the purpose. This oper-
ation broke up the bed of Stone so completely that now with a diving
bell it is easily removed out of the way.—The improvements on the
river consist in cutting a canal through the Natural Bridge at Rock-
haven, which was about 600 yards of Canaling, and to open the river
& swamp for scow naviagtion for about 14 miles above the Nat.
Bridge to a point near Col Gadsdens plantation or about two miles
South of the St. Augustine road. This improvement has been in
progress since the fall of 1833 when the water has been low enough to
carry in on. There now remains but a few weeks work with a small
force of 10 or 15 hands to complete it as far as it is deemed practicable
to expend money upon it.
The funds available for the river & harbour when I first took charge
of the work 1" Jany 1832 was $10.734.80 and there have been appro-
priated at different times since by Congress for the same $10.600.00
There remains now unexpended of these funds but about $1200. which
will complete the work in about Six weeks unless the water should rise
to prevent any farther work on the river, in which case there would be
a few hundred dollars that could be put in the hands of some agent
here to expend the following year to finish it.
In 1833 an appropriation of $5000 was made for the Ocklockney
river which was placed in my hands for the purpose of its improve-
ment." A force of hands was placed on that river in the Summer of
the year of the appropriation to clear the Channel of logs, snags &
rafts. This force commenced work at the mouth of the river &
worked upwards—effectually removing the obstructions, till they
reached Memsons Mills one mile below the bridge on the road from
Tallahassee to Quincy; when the funds were exhausted and the work
was stopped for the want of a further appropriation. Distance of the
river improved about 130 miles—
Independent of the above works, I have gratuitously made a
Survey of the St. Andrews Bay Canal, Mouth of the Aucilla R. Little
R. Originally for the Apalachicola harbour, & again for its extended
improvement & the Chattahoochie R. & Still more recently with a

with St. Marks.

to arise, or not; nor whether the services of the law Agent will be
requisite during the present year. Nor can I express any well grounded

Extract of a letter from Gen D L Clinch to Col Jos M. White
“But the most important point, to the people of E Florida and the
one that has been most grossly neglected is Bellamys Old road, leading
from Alachua Court House, to Picolata Ferry on the St Johns. From
St Augustine to Picolata is 18 miles and from Picolata to Alachien
Court 55 miles, making seventy three miles from Alachien Court to
St Augustine. In fact, this is the only point, to start from, in opening
a communication with the Lawrence river, as the Steam Boat Com-
pany have already gone to much expense, in erecting a good house, &c
at Picolata, and it must in time be the great thoroughfare, for the
trade of Alachua County, and the people of that county, are begining
to take a deep interest in the road, and I have been informed that they
were about to get up a memorial to you for an appropriation to repair
Belamys old road, from the Courthouse to Picolata. I will however
respectfully suggest and urge on you the importance of getting about
$5000 appropriated to repair Belamys Old road from Picolata to
Alachien Court house.””

FORTHKING. 22" January 1835
Sir/ I wrote to you a few days since via St Augustine,” but as the
letter may not reach you as soon as by the regular mail route, I have
thought it proper to write to you again, on a subject which formed
part of my last communication. In that communication, I stated,
that if it was the intention of the Government to remove the Seminole
Indians west in the Spring, with or without their consent, that it
would be necessary in my opinion, to send four additional companies
to this Post, & two to Fort Brooke, & two Six pounders to each Post—
The more I see of this Tribe of Indians, the more fully am I convinced
that they have not the least intention of fulfilling their treaty stipula-
tions, unless compelled to do so by a stronger force than mere words—
Their minds have been so completely perverted, by a set of interested,
& designing men, that no argument or reasoning will have the least
influence with them, except the argument of force—& if a sufficient

military force, to overawe them, is not sent into the Nation, they
will not be removed, & the whole frontier may be laid waste by a
combination of the Indians, Indian negroes, & the Negroes on the
plantations—It is useless to mince this question; it should be met &
met firmly, if their treaty is to be carried into effect, —& I do not
hesitate to state, & I do so from some small knowledge of the Indian
Character, that a large majority of this Nation have not the most
distant idea of going west, & that they will not do so, unless compelled
by a strong military force—I have therefore felt it my duty to make
known to the General-in-Chief my views on this subject, & to call for
a sufficient Military force, completely equipped for active field service,
(& not with 13 rounds of cartridges priman) so as to enable me to
assume any attitude that the Government may think proper to
order me to take, in relation to this wilfully deluded Tribe”—It is to
* An inevitable limitation on the selection of documents for publication in this
series is imposed by budgetary considerations and has therefore been the com-
pelling reason for the establishment of rules of both inclusion and exclusion.
Two editorial principles laid down at the beginning of the series of Territorial
Papers publications were (1) that less relative emphasis is placed upon documents
relating to Indian and military affairs than upon those pertaining to civil ad-
ministration, and (2) that papers heretofore printed are not viewed, except in
special cases, as subject to republication. These principles have been elaborated
in the prefaces to volumes relating to the various territories covered from 1934 to
the present time (see, for example, ante, vol. XXII, pp. vi-vii). An unhappy
result of the general application of these rules in the case of Florida Territory
has been the necessity of omitting many of the more colorful descriptive accounts
of the Seminole Indian embroglio-segregation, emigration, war—which seriously
disrupted for many years the orderly procedure of civil affairs. The issue of
selection is somewhat eased, however, by the well-known fact that the papers in
question have, in the main, been published. Under the circumstances, there-
fore, extensive republication cannot be justified. But there are a good many
relevant documents which have not been printed, and it is my purpose to select
from such unprinted papers a minimum quantity for reproduction in this edition.
The following publications cover with fair completeness the Seminole affair
for the years 1834–1844. The American State Papers, Mil. Affairs, VI, 56–80,
406-410, 433–443, 783, 817–818, 992–1002, 1026–1032, and ibid., VII, 111–115,
125–466, 518–525, 794–894, 951–955, 985–997, embody an official documentation
of the war and its antecedents. John F. Sprague, an active participant in the
war as an army officer, in his The Origin, Progress, and Conclusion of the Florida
War (N.Y., 1848) has interlarded a narrative account of the conflict with a large
number of official and unofficial papers. Of the 527 pages of the book in question
approximately 262 pages contain documents bearing directly on the origin and
course of the war. Senate and House Documents for the 24th and succeeding
Congresses also contain a vast quantity of relevant papers, see especially S. Docs.,
25 Cong., 1 sess., no. 139, 26 Cong., 1 sess., nos. 1 and 278 (1836–1839), 27 Cong.,

It will be of interest to students of the Seminole War to know that the letters

1853, and the papers of the Seminole Agency, 1824–1876, have been microfilmed

RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[NA:HF, 23 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[February 6, 1835]
Whereas the County of Walton has not received the advantage of
a pre-emption to a Quarter Section of land as given to other Counties
in this Territory for the County Seat, and to build Court houses and
Jails: And whereas the principal good lands in said County are now
entered or otherwise appropriated: And whereas there is now by
law a Superior Court held in Said County, and owing to the sparse
population thereof, that it will be too burthensome for the Citizens
therein, to build a suitable Court house and Jail for the accomodation
of said Superior and County Court by way of taxation.
Be it therefore Resolved by the Legislative Council of the Territory
of Florida, that our Delegate in Congress be requested to endeavour
to obtain from Congress a donation of a Section of land to be located
by the Said County Authorities, upon any public land in said County
not otherwise appropriated, to aid them in building a Court house
and Jail in Said County.
Be it further resolved, that a copy of the foregoing preamble and

RESOLUTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[LC: Fla. Terr., Legis. Council, Journal:Pr.]
[February 12, 1835]
Mr. Brown, on a former day, offered the following Preamble and
Resolutions, to wit:
Whereas, the increasing labors of the Judges of the Eastern and
Western Districts of Florida, render it impossible that said Judges
can attend to the various Counties of said Districts to hold the Courts
therein, and to dispense equal justice amongst the good citizens of
this Territory; and whereas several of the Counties of said Districts
are now deprived of a Superior Court from the utter inability of said
Judges to perform the travel and labor which would be imposed on
them by the establishment of a Superir Court in each of said Counties,
It is therefore Resolved, That our Delegate in Congress be, and
he is hereby requested, to endeavor to obtain by all means in his
power, the establishment, in this Territory, of a new Judicial District,
to be called the Judicial Distrct of Suwannee, and to be composed of
the Counties of Madison, Hamilton, Columbia, Alachua, and Hills-

GOVERNOR EATON TO THE SECRETARY OF THE

[NA:TD, ST Lets. from Judges, Marshals, Attys.:ALS]
Tallahassee 13* Feby 1835 FLORIDA
SIR I have rec" your letter concerning the mode of paying off the
members of the Council.” I regret the conclusions you have arrived
at, as to the mode, & hope you will, the reasons being placed before
you, be disposed to change it.
The mode heretofore pursued, was for the Governor to give to each
member a certificate of the pay due to him, which was of par value or
less than par, according to the speculative whims of the fraternity of
brokers; and then, those certificates found their way to Washington
where they have been always paid at irregular periods, thereby
giving increased trouble to those who had to settle the accounts there.
To avoid inconvenience, then, both to you, & to myself; & to avoid
loss & trouble to the members, a pay roll, showing what each member
could claim for pay & mileage and contained upon a single sheet, was
filed with the Union Bank at this place, which agreed to advance the
pay as called for, I giving a draft for the amount at the close of the
Session.” Now at the moment when the Session is about to end
(day after tomorrow) your letter informs me that a draft will be given
by you on Mobile or New Orleans, if the Receiver Gen Call cannot
pay it. Gen'Call is not here, he has gone to Washington. Under
this view I hope the draft to be made, now, will be paid by you."
Hereafter by your directions Gen'Call can make his Deposit in “the
Union Bank of Florida” at this place, and then thro it, the payments

Union Bank.
* Del. White was asked to intercede on this point in a letter from Eaton, Feb.
6, 1835, which was transmitted by White to the Secretary on Feb. 25 (NA, TD,

can be made, which the acts of Congress authorise. The draft I made
will be accompanied by the Pay roll, so that the charge, & credit may
both at once be entered on the books of your Department
The particular features of the case as shown are such as to induce a
hope, that you will not cause to be protested the Bill, which now, is
unavoidable to be drawn, under the previous arrangements which I
have made with the Union Bank. As the law does not inhibit it, I
hope your regulations made at the Department will not."

HON* LEVY WOODBERRY Sec of the Treasury
SIR In reply to the enquiries contained in your letter of the 7"
instant," received by this evenings mail, I pray leave to refer you to
a copy of the Charter of this Institution, herewith enclosed." You
will there see the principles upon which the Bank is founded; & by
which it must be governed.”
Its Capital Stock is not subscribed in the ordinary way; but the
individual Subscriptions are secured by bond of the parties, and
mortgage upon property of ascertained value.
Its operating, or monied Capital, is raised by a Sale of the bonds
of the Territory of Florida, made payable to, (and yet payable by)
the Bank
I have marked the Sections of the Charter, which develope its
principles.

Of the Territorial bonds described in Section 10, Sales has been
made to the Amount of half a million of dollars—Of which the amount
of Three hundred & sixty thousand dollars, have been delivered, &
Payment received. The remaining One hundred and forty thousand
dollars in bonds, were forwarded to New York last week; and will
be paid for, upon their receipt there.
The Contractors for the purchase of the above half Million, have
the Option of taking another half million at an encreased rate of
premium—the Option to be declared on or before the 1* July next.—
And the Bank is pledged that bonds, exceeding the amount of One
Million of dollars, shall not be offered for sale prior to 1* June 1839.
The Capital of the Bank therefore is $1.000.000
Of which there has been paid in $ .360.000
And in a few days the Amount paid in will be $ 500.000.
Should the Contractors decline taking the Second half Million of
bonds, they will be sold to other parties. No refusal, however, is
anticipated.
The Union Bank commenced its operations on the 16" Ultimo.
The enclosed, is a Statement of its affairs, exhibited at the last meet-
ing of the Board of Directors on the 18" instant. When it had been
one month & two days in operation.
The Shares in the Capital Stock of the Bank, are of One hundred

SIR, An appropriation of ten thousand dollars" has been made by
Congress for clearing out the Ocklawaha river from the Saint John’s
to Glassell's Spring near Camp King." You are charged with the
superintendence of the work; and you will take immediate measures
to cause it to be executed. You will consult General D. L. Clinch as
to the propriety of performing the work by hired laborers or by details
from the troops—if the General should think proper to cause the
troops to be employed you will provide whatsoever may be necessary
to facilitate their operations. You will report to me from time to
time the progress which you make, and whether you complete the
work or not during the present season, you will make me a detailed
report of the work performed, and the actual condition of the improve-
ments in time for my annual report.
I have this day required for you the sum of Two thousand dollars
on account of the special appropriation for the work—You will keep
the accounts for this work separate from you accounts for the Quarter
Master's Department, and should you find it convenient to use tools,
or means of transportation, or supplies of the Quarter Master's De-
partment, you will cause them to be valued, and regularly transfer
them to the work. The list of articles, with the value, properly certified
must accompany your property accounts. Further remittances will
be made on your estimates.”—

Tallahassee FLORIDA March 2. 1835
DEAR SIR I recv" your letter,” showing the different appropria-
tions which stand to the credit of this Territory. I thank you for the
information, for indeed so loosely have the records of this office been
heretofore kept, that nothing could be obtained from them. There
are outstanding claims against those appropriations, that ought to
be paid; but I am not willing to be making drafts by piecemeal on the
secretary. Nor do I see the use of any such course.
Will you see M* Woodbury upon this subject and ask if he will
not remit to me warrants, on Mobile, or New Orleans, for the whole
of the several appropriations standing to the credit of this Territory,
so that the people here, entitled to receive it, may be paid by the
Union Bank from time to time, as their claims are ascertained. It
is the simplest and best mode, of disbursing the money. It will be
less troublesome to him, and to myself. Or may I make out a draft
upon him payable at Washington, or N York in favor of the Bank
here, and then thro it, make the disbursements, as they may from
time to time be needed
Please ask him also, if I may draw upon him for my own salary.
That I do not want here; but to be permitted to make a draft on him
for the amount, after the 30" March, when 3 quarters will be due to
me. Please answer me early
respectfully yours
J. H. EATON
Ask Mr. Woodbury also, if Mr. Walker shall draw as secretary for
his salary, or will the approprtn for that purpose be transferred to
the Bank here also—

stated.—
The improvement of the river has been completed as far as was
the first plan of it. A boat has this Season made several successful
trips on it. More might be done to advantage in deepening some
parts of the channel; but the funds having been exhausted, I have
this day brought this work to a close.
The public property used on these works has been stored in Magnolia
with the purpose of selling at Auction all but the Bellboat & Bell.
I have been informed that an appropriation has been made for the
improvement of the Chipola river; *—There is three or four miles
of this river through a cypress swamp where there is deep water
through a thick growth of large trees, which I am acquainted with
from personal examination. These trees ought to be cut at least
three feet under water, and I think by cutting the trees down at the
waters surface & then sinking the bell over the stumps that a ready
means will be had to accomplish the work of cutting the stumps out
of the way—On this account I shall make no further disposition of
this Machine till instructed by you.
I shall close my accounts of the works I have had under my charge

I feel it my duty to suggest to the Department, that in any future
movement of Troops, for this Section of Country, from any point on the
Sea Board; that they be ordered via the mouth of the St. Johns River,
thence up the river to Palatka on the West Bank of the St. Johns
about 100 miles from its mouth, and 70 miles by the waggon road to
this Post. (any vessel that can cross the Bar at the mouth of the
river can ascend to Palatka,) The Asst. Q Master at this post, with a
short previous notice, could have transportation in readiness at
Palatka for this Post. There would be much saving of both time
and expence by this movement. I am respectfully Your obt Servant

The distance across the country from St. Augustine to Palatka is
but 30 miles, but for 10 miles of the distance there is no waggon road—
and at high water or of a wet season, it is impossible to pass the road
even on horse Back without swimming one or two creeks. and from
St. Augustine via Jacksonville to this place is 150 miles—over a very
heavy road. The most expeditious route for troops from St. Augus-
tine to this post is to march across the country over a pretty good
road a distance of 18 miles to Picolata, and there take the steam Boat
to Palatka a distance of 30 miles. where they could take a good waggon
road to this place a distance of 70 miles.

OPINION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
[NA:JD, Atty. Gen. Lets. Sent Book, A2]
ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE March 20, 1835
Report of the Atty General in General Calls case
The Attorney General in pursuance of the reference made to him
by President, in relation to the additional compensation claimed by
General Call for arguing the case of Colin Mitchel and others against
the United States has the honor to report he has no reason to doubt
the statements contained in the letter of General Call to the President,
and that upon the facts so stated he is of the opinion that General
Call is justly entitled to an additional compensation beyond the
amount agreed upon in 1829." Considering that General Call has
attended the Supreme Court of the United States three several Terms,
including the present Term, exclusively for the arguing the case of
Mitchel, for two of which Terms he has as yet received no compen-
sation, except an allowance for travelling and contingent expenses,
and that the case Forbes &" west of the Apalachacola was not brought
before the Supreme Court by appeal I am of the opinion that besides
the usual allowances for travelling expenses for the present Term,
General Call ought to receive the further sum of One Thousand Dol-
lars in full for his services in the case of Mitchell The amount allowed
him for those services will then be $1500 besides traveling expenses,”
which added to the fee paid him in Arrendos case will in truth be $500
less than he ought have reasonably expected to receive for his services
in the Supreme Court in the three causes when he entered into his
engagement with the United States to argue those case.”
All of which is respectfully submitted.

following is extracted:
“The opinion is formed that if a Rail Road is constructed from Tallahassee to
St Marks that the former will be the place of trade, and the latter will only be a
depot for the reception of supplies and the shipment of produce. By means of
the Rail Road, (the distance being only twenty three miles) the two points would
be brought very close together—So that the business of trade as well as the Collec-
tion of the Customs could be transacted with every facility at Tallahassee.
“In conclusion I would recommend that if the Government determine to
abandon Fort St Marks and dependencies as a position for defence—a grant
should be made to the Rail Road Company of Ten Acres of land at the confluence
of the St Marks and Waculla Rivers reserving all that portion of it embraced by
the walls of the Old Fort, and by all the public buildings now standing in the site,
reserving also the right of way to the said reservation. The limits of the reserva-
tion to be defined by commencing at a point on the Waculla River where the
walls of the Fort touch the same River and following the foot of the said
walls to the Eastern corner of the Bomb proof Building following along that
building at the Eastern and Southern front to its Western corner, and thence
following a West line to the River Waculla. This reservation to be held by the
United States until the effects of the Rail Road are ascertained—when, should it
be found necessary to occupy the said reservation for the use of the Custom House
&C the same to remain in possession of the U States and a quantity of land equal
to the quantity of the reservation to be given to the Rail Road Company in order
to make up the full complement of the Grant made by Congress of Ten Acres of
land—Should it be decided on the contrary to establish a Port of Entry at some
more healthy and equally convenient point as at Tallahassee then the said reserva-
tion to be given up to the Rail Road Company.” The Chief Engineer replied
May 5, 1835 (loc. cit., Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 5), approving his proposals.

[NA:TD, ST Lets. to Cabinet and Bureaus, Bk. 1]
TREASURY DEPARTMENT 234 March 1835–
T. L. SMITH Esq." Register of the Treasury
SIR, In reply to the suggestion in Governor Eaton's letter, of the
2" inst,” referred by you to this Department, I am happy to submit
the following remarks.—
1. In respect to any outstanding appropriations in favor of the
Territory of Florida or for public expenditures within it the Depart-
ment is ready to pay them to the proper officers at any moment
when it is shewn by him that the money is needed or has been ex-
pended properly. The usual course and forms will it is hoped create
no delay or inconvenience—and the money when required in pursuance
of them will be paid at Mobile, New Orleans, or any other point
more desirable. The system of paying on drafts was abolished, in
almost every instance, the first year of General Jackson's administra-
tion: and is never resorted to now—except to save the credit of the
Government, and when the draft has been drawn under a mistake
as to the present usage. 2"—In respect to the salaries of all the
officers in the territory—they can receive their pay of Gen: Call, the
Receiver of public money, under a late Circular, or can have
warrants for them on Mobile, or any other Bank more convenient—
at the end of each quarter—according to another Circular issued
last autumn. This Department will use every effort to make prompt
early and convenient payments to all public officers and creditors—
though it will not be practicable to do it, except in such a way and in
pursuance of such forms as are established for the safe and uniform
disbursement of public money"—
Yours respectfully,
L. W-Secy of the Treas"

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE

[NA:JD, Opinions Attys. Genl., Bk. D]
ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE March 26th 1835
SEMINOLE INDIANS, Treaty with them
SIR, In your letter of the 21* instant," after enclosing to me
a communication of Governor Eaton,” in which he suggests doubts
concerning the validity of the Treaty with the Seminole Indians, con-
cluded on the 9" of May 1832,” and ratified on the 9th of April 1834,
in consequence of the delay which took place in the ratification; you
requested my opinion upon the validity of the Treaty, and upon
the right of the United States to remove these Indians in the years
1835, 1836, and 1837.
There is certainly great force in the suggestions made by Governor
Eaton; and as the Government, in its relations and intercourse with
the Indians, is necessarily & obliged to become, for all practical
purposes, its own interpreter and judge, it is under the highest obliga-
tion to make no claim under the treaty, and to set up no construction
of its terms, which are not fairly authorized by its sense and spirit.
And if it can be shown, that a material change of circumstances con-
nected with the question of removal, had actually occurred, during
the period which elapsed between the signing and ratifycation of the
Treaty, then it is plain, that the Indians can no longer be held to it;
unless by some act since its ratification, they have recognized and
affirmed its validity.
In the present case, as no time was limited for the ratification of
the Treaty; as the supplemental articles of the 28" of March 1833,”
treated it as yet in existence, although not then ratified by the Presi-
dent and Senate; and as no material change of curcumstances is
suggested, I think it must be deemed a valid and subsisting treaty.
If the Treaty be valid, the particular intent to remove in 1833,
1834, and 1835, must yield to the general engagement to remove in
three years from the ratification; and the same provision must be
made for the unforeseen case which has now arisen, which was ex-
pressly made for the case actually anticipated. It was evidently the
understanding and design of the parties, that the removal should
commence with the year following the ratification, and that the

WAR DEPARTMENT March 27 1835
TO BREVET BRIGD GEN" D. L. CLINCH Fort King, Florida.
SIR, Governor Eaton has transmitted to the Department the
copy of a letter which he has written to you on the Subject of the
removal of the Seminole Indians from Florida.”
The doubts Suggested by Gov. Eaton in that letter, and in one
addressed by him to this Department * concerning the validity of the
Treaty ratified with the Seminoles in April 1834,” in consequence of
two of the years during which they were to remove having expired,
have been considered by the President. On a full examination, how-
ever, of the Subject the obligation of the Treaty does not Seem to be
affected by this circumstance, as the postponement of the ratification
was occasioned by a Stipulation in the Treaty requiring an examina-
tion of the western Country, and the Subsequent assent of the Semi-
noles before the Treaty could take effect. The ratification was given
as soon after this was effected as practicable.
You will therefore proceed under your original instructions. If
any delay, however, has occurred in consequence of this enterposition
of Gov. Eaton, your conduct in postponing the Subject will be entirely
approved.
Let me however add that in the execution of the task committed
to you I am very desirous that no harsh measures Should be used
which can possibly be avoided. It is only in the last resort, and
under the conviction that the peace of that part of the Country re-

honor to request your attention to the Diagram forwarded you last
year shewing the relative position occupied by these Surveyors re-
spectively, and to remark thereon that the Indian boundary con-
trary to all expectation and information received was found to be near
the South boundary of Towns 13 extending East & west from into
Ranges 19 & 24 widening as going South into the 26 Range on the
East and embracing nearly all of 19 on the West—To guard against
such a possibility I had instructed the Surveyors to extend South on
the East & West of said boundary, which has been accordingly done—
Lake George & St Johns River both are found to be something East
of the Diagram representation. To effect the Object of this Office
however the Mess" Clements obtained permission to run the Paralel
through the Nation, and effected that object thereby attaining, the
correct data to extend the Surveys South as instructed, but the Sur-
veys above could not be connected to the Paralel within the limits of the
Indian boundary, but have been (without the same) both E. & West.
As soon as practicable after the arrival of M" Kerr, I shall have a
rough draft made out and forwarded for your satisfaction explanatory
of the facts here communicated. In drawing your attention now to
these facts, I advise you that on the East between the Indians and the
Atlantic, below where the Surveys are now extended, the Country
is represented to be for some distance a wet Savannah generally im-
passable except in boats, save a narrow strip near the Margin of the
Atlantic; and again on the West not more than two Townships wide
from the Marsh of the Gulf to the Indian boundary aforesaid until we
near the Bay of Tampa. I would suggest for your consideration,
whether it would not be important and desirable to suspend the
public Surveys in that quarter until the Indians shall have been re-
moved agreeably to the stipulations of the 7" Article of the Treaty
with the Seminoles at Camp Paynes landing on the 9" day of May
1832." to enable the extension of the future Surveys regularly on the
whole line of the new paralel and taking also into view the quantity
of work now & to be received in the Office under the Contracts for-
warded last year and that of M Washington a few weeks since and
remarking upon their complex character from the great number of
private claims in some of them, rendering the duties of this Office
extremely onerous—Under all the circumstances I feel constrained
to say, that I can but hope, that if any amount of work shall be or-
dered by you, it will be limited in its quantity, and with these views I
submit the subject for your instructions desiring that I may be ad-
vised thereof as early as practicable to enable me to give the necessary
notice and instructions and have the contracts executed in due time

SIR; The enclosed copies of a communication made direct to the
Hon: Sec of War,” & of a paper signed by a majority of the principal
& Sub-Chiefs of the Seminole Nation,” will inform the general-in-
chief, of the measures that have been adopted in relation to the re-
moval of that Nation to the West—The greatest exertions have been
made, & the strongest arguments urged by General Thompson &
myself, to induce these people to comply with their treaty stipulation,
& to remove to their new homes, without being forced at the point
of the bayonet—They were told at last that their great Father, the
President, had told them that they must comply with their treaty &
go to their new homes; that it was his wish that they should go quietly
& peaceably; that he had caused every arrangement to be made for
their comfort & convenience on the journey; but that he had also
given me the means, if they would not comply with their solemn
treaty, to compel them; and that I would do it—The fact is, the
appropriation for their removal was made so late, that the agent of
the government could not have made the necessary arrangements for
their removal, before the hot season set in, if the Indians had have
been willing to commence removing at this time; but there was not
one that would consent to an immediate removal—The arrangement

the strongest measures could have induced them to enter into it—
I have strong hopes that if the same measures are continued, the
whole Nation may yet be induced to move together by the 1" De-

of the general-in-Chief, that I have made the following disposition
of the Troops placed under my command—Bt Lt: Colonel Fanning,

absence, will be left in command of the Troops in Florida—Bt
Major Zantzinger with his three companies at present at Fort Brooke,
will continue in command of that Post; & is charged with the protec-
tion of that section of country, & with keeping the Indians within
their southern boundary—Bt Major Dade will remain at Key West,
& is directed to give protection to the settlements near Cape Florida,
& to order within their limits, all the Indians that may be found in
that quarter—Captain Thruston " with his company, is ordered to
take post about twelve miles northwest from this, & near the boundary
line, where there are comfortable quarters for himself & command, &
is charged with keeping the Indians within their northwestern bound-
ary, & with giving protection to that section of country—Captain
Drane is ordered to return with his company to Fort Marion, & is
directed to proceed as soon after his arrival at that Post as may be
practicable as far South as Mosquito, or Indian rivers, where it is
reported there are a large number of Indians, & to compel them &
all others that he may find between those rivers & a noted trading
place on the St Johns river, called Volusia, to return within their
limits; & he is charged with the protection of the country east of the
John’s river—The four companies left at this Post, will act as cir-
cumstances may require, & can be made comfortable at very little
or no expense to the government—Asst Surgeon Weightman will
return with Company “D” 2"Artillery to Fort Marion; Asst Surgeon
Archer * will remain at this Post; & Asst Surgeon Clarke * will be

The General, before his departure, and in conjunction with Gen.'
Thompson, the Indian Agent, effected an arrangement with at least
one half of the Seminole Chiefs, by which they and their followers
and their negroes are to leave Florida for their new homes on the
1* of December next, and there are strong reasons to believe that
before that time all the discontented chiefs will come into the measures
of the executive and depart with their brethren. I much fear that
the harmony of this arrangement and the just expectations of the
executive will be destroyed by the cupidity of our own citizens.
Under an impression that the Indian negroes can be bought for little
or nothing, speculators will shortly be flocking in the Country—The
Negroes, who are bold, active and armed will sacrafice some of them
to their rage. This is not all: they will quit the party of their owners
who are disposed to emigrate and join the discontented chiefs who
only want this encouragement to resist the mandates of the Govern-
ment.
Under the circumstances, Gen.' Thompson has particularly requested
me to write and obtain, if possible, orders to turn back every white
man who shall attempt to cross the Indian boundary, and whose
business is not immediately with the troops or public agents here.”

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO WILEY THOMPSON
[NA:OIA, Lets. Sent, Bk. 16]
WAR DEPARTMENT, April 29, 1835
TO GEN WILEY THOMPSON, Seminole Agency, Florida,
SIR, I have received a letter, dated the 12th instant, signed by
Stephen Richards, in behalf of John Yellow Hair."
I have to request that you will state to the latter, that having
signed the treaty made with Mulatto King on the 18th June 1833,"
he is to be considered a party to and bound by all its stipulations.
The second article gave to Mulatto King and Tustenuggy Hajo
“for the benefit of themselves, Sub-Chiefs and Warriors” three sec-
tions of land. These Sections they were authorized to sell, with the
consent of the Executive of Florida. If they did sell them, they were
to choose a country for themselves, and remove thither at their own
expense. The 4th article provided that if they would dispose of their
land to the United States, and emigrate to the Seminole Country
West of the Mississippi, the United States would pay the expenses
of their removal and subsistence, together with three thousand dol-
lars for their reservation, By the 3rd article it was stipulated they
should receive their proportion of the annuity of 5000$ while they
remained, and their proportion of it for its unexpireded term, when
the Seminoles completed their removal.
When Yellow Hair, thro' you, signified his intention to emigrate
with Blunt & Davy, he was informed that he would not thereby en-
titled himself to the benefits of the treaty with them, but would still
be bound by the above stipulations. His proportion therefore of the
annuity for the last year was given to Capt Russell, and has this year
been placed in the hands of Lieut. Harris. The three sections are
granted to the two Chiefs jointly, and by the 4th article, the right of
determining the manner in which they shall be disposed of is granted
to “the chiefs & warriors, parties to this agreement. This Depart-
ment cannot adjust the amount of Yellow Hair's interest, nor enter
into a separate arrangement with him for its relinquishment. If
the land is sold under the 2nd article, and these Indians remove to
any other place than the Seminole Country West, the United States
have only to pay them annually their proportion of the annuity.
But if they surrender their land to the United States, they they will
be benefitted by the provisions of the 4th article.
If Yellow Hair has sustained inconvenience and loss, in conse-
quence of his removal with Blunt, he cannot ask the Department to
1" NA(OIA, Lets. Recd., Apalachicola).

remunerate him, as he was told beforehand that the proceeding would
not be Sanctioned.
You will also say to the chiefs, that Yellow Hair has not lost his
interest in their reservation by his removal, and prevent them from
depriving him of any of the benefits provided for in the treaty.—

SIR, I have obtained authority to employ you in Florida in super-

road from Saint Augustine to Tallahassee and you will endeavor to
ascertain as well from observation, as from inquiry, the parts of the
road that require particular and immediate attention—You will be
able to obtain valuable information on the subject from Colonel
Gadsden, General Clinch, and no doubt from others. The object
will be to apply the appropriation to such parts of the road as most
require repair or reconstruction, and if it should not be sufficient to
complete the whole, to ask for whatsoever may be further necessary
at the next session of Congress.

SIR—Your letter of the 6th Ultimo," has been received at this
Office. Captain Bradley has been assigned to the superintendence of
the road to which you refer; but there can be no objection to your
superintending that part of it between Saint Augustine and Picolata.”
The repairs on that portion of it, however, will not be commenced,
until the repairs be either completed, or in a state of forwardness,
between Picolata and Newmansville."

service of the Department, of $1,500, on your estimate for the present
Quarter.

Warrant for $2000 on acct of the app" for clearing out the Ocklawaha river, in
his favor. Has consulted with General Clinch in relation to that work—who
says it was impossible in the present state of affairs for any step to be taken in
relation to it—but thinks it probable after the 20th inst. the preliminary prepara-
tions might be commenced—It cannot well be done during the Summer months
in consequence of Sickness—& the vast number of the Sand flies, Musquitoes &
other troublesome and annoying insects—Will endeavor to forward the work
when commenced to the best advantage should the Troops be employed-
requests they be allowed in addition to the 15 Cts allowed by law—15 Cts from
the appropriation—as they will be subject to great labour, toil & exposure and
deprived of almost every comfort, Says, that if the Dept has not placed in other
hands the appropriation for opening the Road from St Augustine via Picolata
to Pensacola, or could it be divided, he could easily attend to that part from
St Augustine for 100 miles distance.”
15 Dancy had written the Quartermaster General, Mar. 20, 1835 (NA, WD,

St. Augustine-Tallahassee road in preference to clearing the Oklawaha River, in
order to gain a reputation in the more populated parts of the country.
* Dancy was instructed on June 6, 1835 (loc. cit., Lets. Sent, Bk. 21), to take
over from Bradley the superintendence of the St. Augustine-Tallahassee road,
the latter having been relieved because of ill health. Bradley was instructed on
the same date (loc. cit.) to turn over to Dancy the orders relative to the road

ROBERT BUTLER Esq. S. G. Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, Herewith you will receive a printed copy of the decisions
made by the Supreme Court of the United States at their January
term 1834, in eleven land cases in your Territory,” by which those
claims have been confirmed, and I have to request that you cause
those claims to be surveyed, in strict conformity to the decision in
each case, with the least practicable delay. Where the lands con-
firmed by those decrees have been already surveyed as public lands,
the lines of the claims when surveyed will have to be connected with
the public surveys in such manner as to enable you to ascertain with
accuracy the contents of the Sections which may be made fractional
thereby. When, as in the case of the 20.000 acres confirmed to
Moses E. Levy, within the bounds of the Arredondo grant, the survey
is situated in whole, or in part, within the lines of a previously executed
survey of a confirmed claim, you will in directing the survey of the
tracts now confirmed, cause such accurate connections to be made
between the lines of the two claims as may be necessary to show all
the information which may be desireable respecting the nature and
extent of the interference.
I think it will be advisable, whenever you know the address of the
parties interested in the cases, to notify them in writing as to the
time when you propose causing the survey to be made, in order that
they may have an opportunity of furnishing such information to the
Deputy Surveyor, as they wish to place in his possession."

relates to the repairs of the road from Pensacola to Tallahassee and
thence to Saint Augustine, I have to say, that you will commence, if
you have not already done so, the repairs of the part from Pensacola
to Tallahassee, provided the season and other circumstances render
it proper to do so. In making the repairs, you will be careful to com-
plete, thoroughly, every part which you begin—no part will be
partially done. The amount appropriated for the whole extent of
the road is Fifteen Thousand dollars,” a part of which will be expended
on one end and a part on the other; for the present you will consider
$7.000 as applicable to that portion under your immediate charge,
of which $4000 is this day requested to be remitted to you. You
will make an estimate of such additional sum as may be required to
complete the repairs from Pensacola to Tallahassee, in time to be

ROBERT BUTLER TO ELIJAH HAYWARD
[NA:GLO, Lets. from SG, Fla.:LS]
Surveyor Generals Office TALLAHASSEE June 10" 1835
SIR Your letter of instructions under date 22 Ultimo covering
Eleven cases of Land Claims decreed by the Supreme Court at their
January term 1834 has been received,” and I shall loose no time in
preparing the necessary instructions under the decrees aforesaid
preparatory to their execution, at the same time premising that the
performance of this duty on the part of the deputy Surveyors who
may be assigned thereto, will be greatly unprofitable if not a loosing
business, being a highly responsible and vexatious duty arising out
of the conflicting opinions of the claimants with the duties of these
Officers and the detached nature and small extent of the work to be
executed, yet in all respects requiring the expensive outfit in hands
and equipage as that of an extensive contract.
An imperious sense of duty, will alone induce its engagement by
the Deputy Surveyors.
The Season is now so far advanced as that it is deemed highly
impolitic and hazardous to despatch Surveyors until the month of
October shall have arrived, and this will afford the claimants suffi-
cient time to have the necessary documents prepared to meet the ac-
tion of the Surveyors without any delay in the execution of their
labours, which is alone an important consideration taking into view
the immense expense incurred by them under their most diligent
sense of oeconomy and active movement; supplies of every description
being so extremely high and scarce.
From the cursory reading of the several decrees, I find it will be
necessary for the claimants to furnish the decrees of the Court below
together with the plats of Surveys therein recognized, and also copies
of their grants &c to enable the Surveyors to comply with the several
mandates of the Court above. Will you have the goodness to direct
two additional printed copies of the decrees aforesaid to be sent to

me, as it is important that each Surveyor at least should be placed
in possession of One.
You suggest as proper that I should notify the claimants in writing
as to the time I propose having the Surveys executed &c. I desire
that I may be permitted to publish a notice in the paper of this place
making the necessary requirements of the claimants, & one of each
can be sent by mail to their address leaving no door of censure open
or excuse on their part for inattention. The propriety of this step
will I trust be readily seen by you, and I permitted to adopt it. In
the mean time I shall prepare the notice and instructions and await
your answer.
Should the foregoing remarks suggest to your superior judgment
any any additional instructions, I will be thankful for their trans-
mission.
I would particularly call your attention to the decree in favor of
G JF Clarke for sixteen thousand acres which requires to be run out
within the original Grant, wherein the Court remark (page 17) “But
we do not think these irregular surveys affect the title under the
Original grant, unless the lands have been acquired by others. The
vacant lands within its bounds still belong to the Appellee, and may
now be surveyed by him.” The Court then decree in favor of the
survey by Don A Burgevin for 8000 acres and order the Court below
to adjudge “that the residue of the said granted land be surveyed to
the said petitioner within the limits of the grant” I ask the question;
ought not the survey to be one and entire under the calls of the
grant paying no regard to the survey of 8000 acres within it or must
that be also surveyed; and in the event that part thereof (meaning
the entire grant) shall have been acquired by others can I go without
the limits of the Original grant for compliment or simply shew inter-
ference as heretofore? Are not all surveys decreed as valid and
found fraudulent to be corrected?
To enable me to secure the services of two Deputy Surveyors in
the execution of the foregoing decrees I shall offer them the execution
of some unfinished work on the West of Suwanee River which could
not be executed at the time the surveys were in progression there
owing to an extraordinary freshet in said River. I learn that there
is some desirable land within the district unsurveyed.
I have just seen a copy of the Decree in favor of Colin Mitchell
and others made at last term of the Supreme Court * and from the

SIR, In obedience to your orders of the 5" May *"I have caused
a Survey to be made of Fort S*Marks and its vicinity at the junction
of the St Marks and Waculla Rivers, and now enclose you a Map *
of the same.
The Law of Congress grants to the Tallahassee Rail Road Company
“ten acres of land at the junction of the S*Marks and Waculla Rivers
(the point where the Road terminates) exclusive of such portions as
shall be actually improved by individuals and now in their occupancy,
and also exclusive of such portions as, in the opinion of the President
it may be expedient to reserve for the national defence or other
public use.” "
In laying off the reservation of the Site of the Fort I have adopted
the line F’ F’’ F’’’ F’’’’ commencing at the Waculla river and
following the walls and pickets of the Old Fort until they intersect
the St Marks River. Exterior to this line and parallel to it I caused
thirty feet to be laid off for a ditch. The line A.B. was then run at
the distance of 100 feet and parallel to the ditch—this line is marked

limits of the reserve for the U. States.
Within this line several persons have occupancy. On the exterior
of the line several portions of the land, actually held and improved by
individuals are numbered from 1 to 25.
The reservations for the U. States and for individuals occupy the
whole of the land immediately at the junction of the S" Marks and
Waculla Rivers, leaving exteriorly to it a marsh subject to the daily
overflowing of the tide and is totally unfit for the purposes of a depot
desired to be obtained by the Rail Road Company. For these
reas [ons] and adopting what I believed to be the spirit of the law
of Congress, I directed the location of the grant to the Company to be
made in such a manner as the President & directors should desire—
accordingly the location indicated in the Map was selected by the
President of the Company.
I have furnished the President and Directors with a copy of this
Map together with a letter informing them that when the sanction
of the Secretary of War shall have been obtained the Grant will be
finally confirmed.
The interference of other more pressing duties rendered it necessary
for me to employ an assistant in making the survey.”

he had become interested in the publication of the Columbus Sentinel and in
practicing law at that place and therefore resigned the appointment as attorney
at Key West (NA, SD, Resignations). He had applied for the appointment in

SIR, In reply to your letter of the 10" inst: * I have to state that
I do not perceive any objection to your giving the notice to the claim-
ants under the decrees made by the Supreme Court in 1834, required
by the letter of the 22" ult” * by publishing such notice for a few
times in the newspaper at Tallahassee," taking such other measures
as may be necessary to ensure the reception of such notice by the
parties interested in those claims.
In relation to the case of Clarke claiming 16.000 acres, I am of
opinion that in the first case the tract of 8000 acres within the limits
of the original grant as surveyed by Burgevin, and now confirmed by
the Supreme Court, must be surveyed, and if the District Court has
taken the further proceedings in the case required by the decree of
the Supreme Court, then the residuary 8000 acres are also to be sur-
veyed. In neither case, however, can you go without the limits of
the original grant to get the specified area; and if there are other
claims interfering with the original grant, then the nature and extent
of such interferences must be ascertained and exhibited upon the plats.

THE HON: LEVI WOODBURY, Sec'y of Trea'y.
SIR: In relation to your reference to this office of the letter of the
9" Instant,”fromColin Mitchel respecting the survey of the lands con-
firmed to him and others, at the last Term of the Supreme Court of The
United States,” I beg leave to remark that the opinion of the Court
states that “the lands are in four separate tracts, extending from the
Mouth of the S" Marks outside of the Islands along the Seacoast to
the West end of S. Vincent's Island, West of the Mouth of the River
Appalachicola; thence to that River about five miles from its Mouth,
up the same for many miles; thence by a back line to a point on the
Western Bank of the S" Marks, above the Old Fort of that name,
and down the said River to the Sea.” It also states that “it is un-
necessary to refer to the boundaries of the separate tracts, or the
particular designation of the lines and points of the whole body of
lands, as they are not a subject of controversy in this case.”
The Decree confirms the claims of the Petitioners to all the lands
within the limits of the first three described tracts, and also to the

fourth tract, with the exception of the part thereof in the immediate
neighborhood of, and including Fort S. Marks, which is directed to
be reserved as the property and for the use of the United States, the
extent and boundaries of which Reservation are to be ascertained
and determined by the Superior Court of the Middle District of Flor-
ida, upon the principles laid down by the Supreme Court. The decree
then orders and directs the Clerk of the Court to “certify the same to
the Surveyor General of Florida, pursuant to law, with directions to
survey and lay off the lands described in the petition of the Claimant,
according to the lines, boundaries, and description thereof in the
several deeds of cession, Grant, and Confirmation by the Indians or
Governor of West Florida, filed as exhibits in this case, or referred to
in the records thereof, excepting nevertheless such part of the tract
granted in 1811, lying East of the tract granted in 1804 and 1806,
as is hereby declared to be the Territory of The United States, pur-
suant to the exception herein before mentioned, and to make return
thereof according to law as to all the lands comprehended in the three
first herein mentioned tracts. And as to the tract last herein men-
tioned, to survey, and in like manner to lay off the same, so soon as
the extent of the land herein excepted and reserved for the use of
The United States shall be ascertained in the manner herein before
directed.”
In answer to an application made to the Clerk of the Supreme
Court he has informed this office that he has made no communication
to the Surveyor General respecting this decision of the Court, but
he has sent to this Office a certified copy of the decree in the case.
The Surveyor General in writing to this Office under date of the
10th Instant,” says, “I have just seen a copy of the Decree in favor of
Colin Mitchel and others, made at the last Term of the Supreme Court,
and from the complex nature of the boundaries, including Islands,
together with what may be the final determination of the Court below
as to what extent of domain will be awarded The United States at the
Fortress of St Marks, I feel very solicitous that when you may instruct
me to have that survey executed, that the path of duty may be plainly
marked out by the authorities at Washington where every point of
information and documents exist touching the subject. It appears by
said decree that the several deeds of cession, &c, filed or referred to
in the record are to have their lines, boundaries, &c, all laid off by the
Surveyor General.”
If instructions are now to be given by this Office to the Surveyor
General, in relation to the execution of the surveys, I beg leave to
request your directions upon the following points:

1* Are separate surveys to be made of each of the first three men-

2" Is the survey of the fourth tract to be delayed until the land,
excepted from the confirmation in this case, and reserved for the use
of The United States shall be ascertained in the manner pointed out in
the decree; or shall the exterior lines of the claim be now surveyed,
leaving the reserved tract at S* Marks to be surveyed whenever its
extent and boundaries shall be determined by the Court below?
If the surveys are now to be made, I propose furnishing the Surveyor
General, with the printed Copy of the Record of the Court below, now
in this Office, in which the boundaries of the particular tracts are
described, and instructing him to have the surveys executed in strict
conformity to the decree of the Supreme Court.

that part of the road between Tallahassee & St Augustine. I have
not pass'd over that road since Oct. 1833 at which time I made an
examination of it to estimate to estimate the cost of the repairs then
required; in the report accompanying that estimate a change is recom-
mended in part of the route:” The route proposed is from Talla:
follow the old Mil” road to Magees (56 miles) near Sampala Lake
thence take the North (instead of the South) side of that Lake follow-
ing a road partially cut out by M* Leavingston to a ferry lately estab-
lished over the Suwanee a mile and a half below the junction of the
Withlacoshee with that river (21 miles) thence a route marked out
about three years ago direct (not by the Ross Springs) thro: Alagator
Settlement to Roberts the site of Columbia County Court House
(38 miles) and thence to cut a road to intersect the Alachua road at or
near Ubanks (45 miles) and follow the Alachua road to Jacksonville
(5 miles) thence the old Kings road to within six miles of St Augustine
and thence the road now used to the latter place (39 miles) making a
total distance of 204 miles; The amount estimated for was $10,900–
and I presume it will require full more than that to accomplish the
object at this time.
The repairs required between Tallahassee and Magees the place of
leaving the Mil” road are, the stumps to be cut out of the tract of the
road, a Bridge to be made over a creek fourteen miles east of Talla:
and one about two miles East of Ocilla river, and several low places to
be causwayed in the whole distance; at the time of making the estimate
I was urged to include in it the cost of a Bridge over the Ocilla but did
not do it for the reason that it frequently overflows its banks to too
great an extent to Bridge and were the river only to be bridged the
ferry boat would most probably be layed aside and the travel would
then be interupted at times by high water. Whereas by continuing
the ferry the Boat can always be taken to the edge of the water high
or low, from Magees to the Suwanee the road requires to be better cut
out and straightened it passes over good ground & requires but one
small Bridge & no causwaying: by refferance to Searcys map of Flo.
it would appear to make very much of a crooke in the road to take it
North of Sampala Lake, it is not the case however it makes much less
of a bend than to go to the South of it, the lake is not correctly layed
down on the map; from the Suwanee ferry to Roberts” which is situ-
ated directly north of Alagator Lake three miles. the road has been
marked out and carts have travelled it and part of it has been par-
tially cut out, it requires to be cut anew in part and straightened, there
are no bridges required, about one and a half miles next west of Davis'
place is low ground most of it will require to be thrown up from Rob-
"Ante, XXIV, 890.

erts' there is a trail or road leading to Jacksonville which crosses Big
Creek near its mouth, this trail should not be followed for besides mak-
ing the distance full one third more it is not so good a route for a road
as the direct one. from Roberts a new road should be cut to intersect
the Alachua road near Ubank's place. in this distance two Bridges
over creeks will be required and perhaps a third small one, and towards
the east end of it many low places will require to be thrown up. From
Ubanks to Jacksonville but little if any work is required, from Jack-
sonville to St Augustine some little repairs to the old Kings road is
required and some causwaying near St Augustine and perhaps some of
the Bridges on the old Kings road may require to be renewed by this
time

* Among the duties of the territorial secretary as prescribed by the Ordnance
of 1787 (the Northwest Ordnance), and repeated in the laws establishing subse-
quent territories (see act establishing Florida Territory, ante, vol. XXII, 391), was
to “record and preserve all the papers and proceedings of the executive, and all
the acts of the Governor and legislative council, and transmit authentic copies of
the proceedings of the governor, in his Executive Department, every six months
to the President of the United States”. These journals, as kept by the various
secretaries in the different territories, followed no consistent pattern either of ar-
rangement or content. A few contained lists of appointments and copies of
official documents, such as correspondence, proclamations and orders. Examples
of this type are represented in Territorial Papers, III (N.W. Terr.), 263–535; x
(Mich.), 713–733; x1 (Mich.), 76–101; xv (Mo.), 37–47, 187–196; xvii (Ill.), 619–
672. Others contained only lists of appointments, as ibid., XIX (Ark.), 789–814.
With respect to the Territory of Florida, the originals of its Journals of Execu-
tive Proceedings have disappeared (if they existed-there being no evidence of
their receipt by the Federal Government); and no one of them has been printed.
But there is a copy each of three of the journals present in NA (SD) covering

Governor Eatons answer to Col" Murats letter concerning the directory
of the Union Bank of Florida
Your letter soliciting the interference of the Executive because Col."
Nutall whom you aver to be a partner of Col" Braden and hence dis-
qualified to be a director of the Union Bank has been received and
read. I beg leave to say that admitting the fact of partnership to
exist, about which I know nothing; No authority or right exists for
me to interfere; Infractions of the charter are matters for the Juditiary,
not the Executive to enquire about, the Governor shall nominate five
directors and with the consent of the Council may appoint them,
But here his power ceases, and should a vacancy from any cause
whatever occur, the Board only by the Charter is compitent to supply
the vacancy; In support of your application you refer me to a law
of the present session, which grants authority to the Governor to
remove from office Justices of the Peace; Auctioneers and other officers
for satisfactory cause shown, The law is misconceived by you: A
director is not an officer, His is mere trust, But suppose the right
do exist, still another difficulty arises, which is that sufficient cause
is not shown, Cause for removal from office must be a something
done by the individual complained of and not by another. The
complaint made by you, does not show, a culpability on the part of
Col" Nutall, but on the part of the Stockholders, for selecting him to
be a director, he being as you state a partner of Col” Braden, In this
point of view the error is theirs not his; But taking the fact to be,
as it is stated there would be no right, both being duly chosen, to
remove Nutall more than Braden; At any rat I cannot perceive any
authority, that I can have to interfere

SIR Last year the appropriation for the contingencies of the Exec-
utive Office of Florida was $350, the same has been made this year,
making for the two years $700" I have made a draft on the appro-
priation for 1834 for 15375/100 and on that for 1835 for 3850/100 the
balance remaining then for the two years then is $518
The office is without the comforts which should belong to it. A few
chairs, some stained (painted) desks and an old pine table, make up
its cataloge of furniture, there are no curtains to the windows, no settees
as you have in the City & no decent cases in which to preserve the
books and records of the office and no carpet to the floor.
I disire to avoid any expense upon anything of uncertainty of right;
and therefore ask you and therefore ask you to say; whether I may be
at liberty out of the balance of these two appropriations of 1834 and
35 for contingencies to expend it for such purposes as I have suggested
Evidently they are contingencies to expend for such purposes, I have
proposed, I beg the favor of you to advise me whether I can do so,
or not & I will be governed accordingly.
The draft made upon you and forwarded 18" Feb' last for pay of
members and Officers have never been heard from altho 44 days
have intervened, which is double the period for a letter to go to and
return from Washington City

EXECUTIVE OFFICE 2 April 1835
SIR A petition addressed to the Legislative Council has been
forwarded to me, Charging Balley Winn Justice of the Peace for
Jefferson County with certain enormaties and offences & asking
that he may be removed from his said office; By a cirtificate accompan-
ing said petition it appears that the Grand Jury have found a Bill of
Indictment against the said Winn which is yet pending before the
Court
A statement of the facts being certified to me I shall feel myself
constrained to act, but when it further appears that the matters
complained of are undergoing a juditial enquiry, the subject is pre-
sented in a different form; and I am to forbear until the party can be
heard in his defence. The finding of a Grand Jury is always of ex
parte character, and altho it creates a strong presumption of guilt
does not necessarily make out the certainty of guilt pending a criminal
prosecution, The Executive should forbear doing any thing, which
by possibility even; could effect the rights and interest of the accused;
The removing the incumbent from office before trial, might create a
prejudice against him on the public mind, too strong for him to resist,
A further reason for now refusing to act is, that by the present law, the
Court is authorised upon conviction to make the removal from office
a part of the sentance to be imposed under all the circumstances, I
do not think it a proper case for the Executive to interfere with,
The law having taken hold of the matter its action must be wated for

It has been represented to me that Isaac Nathans of Jackson County
lately at the Superior Court held for said County was found guilty
of an assault and battery on a certain Rob" W Bell and that a fine
greatly disproportionate to the offence charged has been assessed
in as much as his precunary circumstances are moderate; It is shown
also that the battery was of a mild not violent nature, occasioning no
boddily injury to the party; and the provoking cause (to wit) the abuse
and slander of the female part of his family, rendered his conduct
and course in a great degree excusable if not entirely justifiable It
further appears that said Nathans bears a reputation of being an
orderly, quiet, and peaceable member of Society; and that tho present
when the assault was committed by Sewell upon Bell it was unknown
to him that any thing of the kind was meditated.
Now I Jn” H Eaton Governor of the Territory of Florida in virtue
of the Authority to me confided, do hereby release, acquit, discharge
and pardon said Isaac Nathans of Ninety-five dollars, part of the fine
of One Hundred dollars so assessed against him at the recent Superior

regret that I do not feel authorized to interfere in their relief, but in
the absence of all law authoriseing such interfereance on the part of

The law requires the Clerk on his election to give security but pro-
vides no way for the release of the security or for the giving of new
security by the Clerk should the security first given be released by the
Executive, there would be no authority to demand of the Clerk new
security and the public interest might thus be placed in the hands of

164 T E R R ITO RIA L PA P E R S
receipt of information from the department of my appointment to
take charge of that part of the military Road te Tallahassee from
St: Augustine to Tallahassee,” I proceeded to examine the road
from this place to a distance of about fifty miles; and being within 20
miles of Newnansville—My examination had more particular reference
to the part of the Road, from the St: Johns River to its intersection
with the road from Tampa Bay to Colerain Ge" being about 38 miles.
This road was formerly opened by M. Bellamy I believe about
1824 *—The work was badly done, the Trees having been cut out for
a width of 20 feet—and the stumps left standing from 1 to 2 feet in
height in the road. The causways were badly made, and in no instance
were they raised to a sufficient height to ensure a dry bed for the road.
The trace of the road, in many instances being very serpentine, merely
to avoid an occasional low spot of ground, in the direct course. In
proceeding from the river, there will be ditching and causwaying on
the first 12 miles of about 3 miles (summing up all the low wet places,)
In straightening the road, there will be a considerable quantity of
cutting & grubbing (the grubbing will would be common to both the
new and old trace.) From the 12" mile to about the 27" mile the
country is generally high and rolling and sandy—there will be but
little work required on that distance, cutting out fallen logs and in-
creasing the width from 20 to 30 feet. From the 27" mile the country
again becomes flat, requiring ditching and causways for about 3 miles
in the next 10 miles and opening from 20 to 30 feet. This is the only
part of the road as yet examined by me west of the St. Johns River—
I shall endeavor to leave this between the 1" and 10" of August, to
examine the road from this to Tallahassee, and shall report the state
of it immediately on my return.
On the 20" instant I broke ground on the west bank of the St.
Johns River, with a force of 25 men, which has been gradually increased
to 35 men. I have employed as yet none but white laborers. Several
days were required in getting them well organized and putting the
tools &c in order. I have the party, now divided into three squads—
The one employed in cutting and opening out the road. The second
in ditching and causwaying; The third in grubbing and taking out
the stumps of trees. The leading points in my instructions to my
director are the following. To cut and clear out the trees for a width
of 30 feet—To cut down all trees, within 20 feet of the edge of the
road that have an evident inclination towards the road.—To have
the stumps and roots taken our for a width of 25 feet.—To have the
causways and bridges 20 feet wide, the former from 1% to 2 feet higher

than the adjacent ground—and the latter above the highest waters—
To follow the old trace unless by varying from it, there is a saving
of distance, and improvement in the bed of the road—
I feel confident, should we all continue to enjoy health, that I
shall be able to give you a good account of my progress at the end of
August. I have been compelled to give high wages, averaging $20.
per month, but good men could not be obtained at this season of the
year to work in the country for less.
I will now proceed to give you my ideas in relation to the Road—
for which purpose I will consider it as divided into three sections.
The first from St. Augustine to Picolata on the St. Johns (18 miles).
The Second from the St. Johns to Newnansville distant about 60
miles—The third from Newnansville to Tallahassee about 30 miles—
The third section is now travelled, by the mail and all travellers from
west to east & the reverse, and I am told is in pretty good condition.
The second section was cut out some 8 or 10 years since, but for the
want of a good ferry across the St. Johns, and the fact of the road
having been badly constructed it has been entirely abandoned for the
last 5 or 6 years. With the road well constructed and a good ferry
at the St. Johns it will soon become the general thoroughfare, from
east to west, as there will be a saving of 40 miles by this route from
St. Augustine to Newnansville, from the route necessarily travelled
between said points at present via Jacksonville-and all the Alachua
Trade will seek this road. The first section is now and will continue
to be that mostly travelled Picolata being the point on the St. Johns
at which the Steam Boat from Savannah lands passengers. There
is now stages 2, 3 & sometimes 4 running weekly & twice a week with
passengers, between the St. Johns and St. Augustine-It is not
withstanding the worst part of the whole road that I have seen, being
extremely crooked and passing a greater part of the distance thro' a
low flat country which at a wet time is so boggy as to render it almost
impassable, and my opinion is that it would cost more to repair and
make good the old trace—than it would to lay out a direct trace from
St. Augustine to Picolata—with some slight variations from a direct
line. I have to request permission from the department to change the
location, wherever there is a manifest advantage to be gained either
in distance or quality of the ground for a road. This part of the road
is destined to become a very great thorough fare-and my opinion is
that a good and direct road should be constructed at once, and if the
Department approves it, I will on my return from Tallahassee raise
a party and commence work at once from this city to Picolata—I
make the above suggestions, from the present conviction the $4000.
will make good the road from the St. Johns to Newnansville, and
the remaining $3000. could not be more usefully applied than from St.

I am very respectfully Sir, Your obt. Servant
F. L. DANCYLieut. & A.A.Q. Master
"A second report by Dancy to the Quartermaster General, Sept. 30, 1835
(NA; WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File), contains a minute description of the
terrain within which the St. Augustine-Tallahassee military road lies, and con-
cludes with the following recommendations:
“It now remains for me to give my opinion of the relative merits, between this
route, and that described by Capt: Shannon in his report dated 5th July 1835.
The two routes pursue nearly the same track from Tallahassee to the Aligator set-
tlement there being however from 5 to 7 miles difference in the estimated dis-
tance, in favor of the route proposed by him and passing thro’ the same region of
country—and distant at no one point but a few miles from each other, there can
be but little difference in their cost of construction. At Aligator the two routes
diverge the one to Jacksonville and the other to Newnansville. Capt: S. states
the distance from Aligator to Jacksonville as being but 50 miles: where as my in-
formation, (derived from those who have repeatedly travelled the route, and those
who live, both at Alligator and Jacksonville, for I have not been able to examine
it) states it as being 75 miles, thro a low flat pine Barren covered with the Scrub
Palmetta and interspersed with numerous boggy Swamps & ponds & even in a dry
season, as being almost impassable for loaded teams—and that to render it a firm
dry road, would require ditching and causewaying for two thirds of the whole
distance. I rather think that Capt. Shannon has been misinformed, or that from
the lapse of time, he has made a mistake in the distance of 25 miles—I was de-
sirous of examining it, to be certain before making this report, but it has been out
of my power to do so, (on acct of my official engagements).
“Again, let the distance be what it may, it matters but little, in comparing the
two routes, for their objects I conceive to be so perfectly distinct as to forbid a
comparison. The route via Newnansville and Picolata is for the accomodation
of the Alachua Country, which is fast rising to importance, being the most fertile
district in east Florida. This road will shorten the distance to navigable waters
for that region from 20 to 30 miles, besides opening to them a new and additional
market, both at Picolata and St. Augustine. The distance from the Atlantic
Coast, (by this route,) will be less to the Southwestern part of East Florida, will
be less than from Jacksonville by 50 miles: This (Alachua) region is fast increasing
in population, and its agricultural products are such as will not bear land trans-
portation to any great extent, without serious injury to its quality and vastly
diminishing its profits to the Grower—
“The distance from St: Augustine to Tallahassee via Jacksonville will be if my
supposition be correct 220 miles instead of 204 as stated by Capt. Shannon. From
the length of time that has elapsed since Capt. Shannon traversed the route and
made his estimate, I would say that 15 percent should be added to said estimate
($10,900) which would make it, the cost ($12,535.00) I say 15 percent from the
fact that from St. Augustine to Jacksonville 39 miles all the Bridges require
renewing.
“From the above Statements, I would recommend that appropriations be asked
for both routes from St: Augustine via Picolata and from St: Augustine via Jack-
sonville to Alligator, and thence one route to Tallahassee—
“The appropriation should then run as follows: From St: Augustine via Pico-
lata Newnonsville & Aligator to Tallahassee $10.246.33, add 10 percent for con-

WASHINGTON CITY 6. Aug. 1835
SIR In reply to your enquiry, at what time my salary as Gov' of
Florida shall commence, I beg to say, that my Commission bears date
in april; but as I was engaged in performing the duties of President
of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal C° until the month of June, I desire
that my Salary as Governor of Florida shall be considered as com-
mencing on the 1* day of July 1834, which will make one years pay
to be now due me."

SIR, Your letter of the 6" Ult” with your account, and N* 5 and
50 of your paper, (the Pensacola Gazette) have been received this day.”
I enclose a check of the Bank of the Metropolis on the Commercial
Bank, New Orleans for the amount of the account, $6125/100. It is
against the rule of the Department to pay accounts for publishing
the laws of the U.S. until it has evidence of the publication having
tingiences and the amount required would be $11,270.96. And for repairing the
Old Kings Road and opening a new road, from St: Augustine to Jacksonville and
thence to Alligator $7.545.00, which added to the former sum of $11.270.96 will
make for the Mil: Road from St: Augustine to Tallahassee and for the road from
St: Augustine via Jacksonville to Alligator the sum of $18,815.96 the whole of
which will be required to effect the objects as they should be done. Which is
most respectfully submitted.”

[NA:WD, QMG Consolidated Corr. File:ALS]
Garrison of Key West, FLORIDA, 14"August, 1835.
SIR, In consequence of the uncertainty of the arrival at, and
departure of the Mail from this place, by the way of Charleston, under
the last contract, I expect to be compelled to send the Motto occa-
sionally to that city. If she had not been absent at Nassua, in July,
I should have dispatched her on the 15" of that month, with the
public documents due the different branches of the Service, at Wash-
ington, and elsewhere, from this Post, and directed the Captain to
bring the mail. As the vessel which should bring it has not yet
arrived, and as we have been three months without the mail the
Motto sails with it to morrow, to Charleston. Under the previous
contract made with M. Oliver O'Hara, by the Post Office Department,
and disposed of by him to M' Housman of Indian Key, and Capt.
Cold of the Schooner, John Dennison, the mail which was carried by
Capt. Cold was received very regularly. The Citizens as well as the
Military here, would be glad if an arrangement to carry the Mail
could again be made with these persons. It is highly important to
the Public Service, that we should get it at this Post at least once
a month regularly, but if the contract for carrying it has been made, as
I understand it has, there is every probability, that we shall get it
very irregularly, and often suffer from failures. I will thank the
Qr. Mr. Gen' to see the Post Master General on this subject. You
will perceive from the enclosed communication from Gen Clinch
that the services of the Motto will be required, to enable me to execute

session of 1835 for which his account for $125 was certified (NA, GAO, Misc.

SIR, Your communication, enclosed with a statement made by
certain citizens at Cape Florida, in relation to the Indians, has been
received, and I am directed by General Clinch to say to you,
that the protection of the section of Country lying between Cape
Florida and Charlotte Harbor, is committed to your charge. You
will from time to time detach from your Company a body of men, of
which you will take the command yourself or not, as you may think
proper, to examine the Country lying between the above-mentioned
points, and to order and compel to return within their boundary line,
all the Indians that may be found without it.
After the 20" May, all communications for General Clinch, will
be directed to Fort Marion, St: Augustine, Florida.

ensueing year * have all been duly received, with their accompanying
documents respectively; and the necessary measures, have been
adopted on my part to have them executed at as early a period as
their requirements demand—It becomes my duty to inform you that
the business of my Office has been almost suspended for several weeks
past, owing to the indisposition of all my clerks, one of whom has been
absent with leave for some time, one other dangerously ill, and the
third I hope will sone be enabled to resume his duties efficiently, al-
though at no time entirely suspended—I have been enabled thus far
to attend to my branch of the duties, without any or but slight inter-
ruption. Much sickness prevails in the country generally arising as is
believed from a protracted rainy season (since the 1* June to the pres-
ent time.)
I have carefully examined the case of Panton Leslie & C° as com-
piled in the printed volume sent me, and hope to be able to have the
Decree in that case fully executed, and when completed shall be en-
abled to have laid down the Donation first above refered to.
Mr R B Ker D* Sur" (who returned near three months since) has
been confined with sickness, and as yet unable to make his returns for
the Office. M' Washington is shortly expected to arrive, whose re-
turns, together with M Ker's, will complete the contracts of last year.
The quantity of work on hand arising from those contracts, to-
gether with the work about to be executed under the orders recently
received will in all probability be as much as the Office can wade
through until the fall of next year, taking into view the sickness which
has prevailed in the country, and likely to continue for some time yet,
and under this belief, I shall be governed in making the required
estimate.
The late period (a few weeks since) that I became furnished with
instructions, to have the field notes of my Office transcribed under the
appropriations of 1834 * & 5.” has from the situation of the country,
precluded my making any arrangements touching that subject, not
being able to employ efficient Clerks up to the present period: conse-
quently no part of those appropriations have been applied, nor yet
can be, for a time to come.
My health has been slightly impaired for a few days past, but sin-
cerely hope that nothing serious may grow out of it. You will readily
perceive that the object of this communication is to afford you general
information, and I remain very respectfully Y." M* Ob" St

SIR. Enclosed I have the honor to forward you my returns con-
nected with the operations on the military road from St: Augustine
to Pensacola Fa during the month of August 1835. With an estimate
of Funds for the same for the month of September 1835. which I hope
will prove satisfactory.
Operations were commenced by me on the 20" day of July on the
west bank of the St. Johns River opposite the town of Picolata. I
can scarcely say that we had got well organized and prepared to work
to advantage before the 1" of August. Up to the 31" of August we
had cleared and grubbed the road 30 and 25 feet wide for the distance
of 15 miles—in which distance we had ditched and causwayed about
3,500 feet, made 5 bridges averaging 10 feet in length, where the road
had been previously opened every stump left had to be cut down to
the ground, which was worse than taking out a standing tree. The
causways will require some little work on them after they have been
allowed to settle, when I do not hesitate to say, it will be one of the
best roads in the Territory. I think I shall be able to accomplish the
distance to Newnansville for the amount stated in my communication
of the 31* of July ultimo to the department, which is respectfully
submitted.

In reply I have to state, that the act of Congress of 30th June
1834,” for the organization of the Indian Department, prescribes
that the agency for the Florida Indians should be discontinued on
the 31st day of December 1834. It is not in the power of this Depart-
ment to reestablish it after their removal, unless provision is made
by Congress, for that object.
You will please to communicate this answer to the Chiefs, and in-
form them that however desirous they may be to have a separate
agent, they cannot be permitted to make the want of one a reason
for postponing a fulfilment of their engagements to remove to the
country assigned to them West of the Mississippi.”

SIR. The Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, on the
14" of Feb’ last passed an act incorporating the East Florida Rail
Road Company,” with authority to construct a Rail Road from any
point on the St Johns river or its tributaries, or South and East of
said river to the Gulph of Mexico; and the Congress of the United
States on the third of March last passed an act making certain grants
to three Rail road Companies viz: one from Tallahasse to St Marks;
one from Pensacola to the Chattahoochie river “and also another rail
road authorized by acts of the Legislatures of the state of Georgia and
the Territory of Florida, from the St Johns in East Florida to the
Suwanne river in said Territory or to vacassa Bay at the mouth
Of Said river” *
We suppose the East Florida rail road company to be the one here
described; but as there is some ambiguity in the description, owing
probably to the haste with which the act was drawn and the late hour
of the Session at which it passed Congress, the company, on whose
authority and behalf we address you, before commencing their work
or entering upon any of the public lands for that purpose, are desirous

of your opinion upon the case, and of obtaining the consent of the
Government to take such of said lands as in their opinion this act of
Congress authorizes the Company to occupy.
If the act do not apply to the East Florida Rail Road Company, it
must be inoperative as there is none other to which it can apply; and
it is hardly supposable that Congress would pass a nugatory act
The constructing of this road through the public lands will add much
more to their value than the worth of the small strip granted by the
aforesaid act; and we have no doubt will be an inducement to the
Executive to afford every lawful facility for the prosecution of the
work. We have therefore to request that you will authorize the East
Florida rail road Company to take the timber and land along the line
of said road as specified in the aforesaid act, if in your opinion its
provisions are applicable, as we presume they are, to said Company
We have to solicit an early decision, as the Company are desirous
of prosecuting their work immediately, and to wait for an explanatory
act from Congress would lose to them the favourable season, and delay
their operations for a year *

SIR, In your communication of the 12" instant, you request me to
state, whether in my opinion, the Executive can, with propriety, un-
der the provisions of the Act of Congress of the 3" of March 1835,”
authorise the East Florida Rail Road company, to occupy the Public
Lands for the construction of their Road, with the other privileges
enumerated in the second section of said Act?
The 4* Section of the Act referred to extends the previous provi-
sions to three Rail Road companies, the last of which is described as
a Rail Road “authorized by acts of the Legislature of the state of

Georgia, and the Territory of Florida, from the St John's river in
East Florida, to the Suwannee river in said Territory, or to Wacosom"
Bay at the mouth of said river.” The act of the Legislative Council
of the Territory of Florida incorporating the East Florida Rail Road
Company, confers on that Company the privilege of constructing
a Rail Road, “from any point on the S" John's river or its tributaries,
or South and east of said river, to the Gulf of Mexico, or waters
emptying therein”. This law therefore, in effect, authorises a Rail
Road from the S" John's river to the Suwannee river (which empties
into the Gulf of Mexico) or to Vacasom Bay (which is on the Gulf of
Mexico); and if the Company determine to construct such a road,
I think it will be brought within the provisions of the Act of Congress,
unless there be some other Company authorised by acts of the state
of Georgia and the Territory of Florida, more nearly answering to
the description above quoted. I am informed by the communication
accompanying your letter, that there is no such other company, and

it is probable that in many of those cases where the proof was not
sufficient to entitle the claimants to the benefit of the Act of 22*

6th October, 1835.
THE REGISTER Tallahassee, Florida.
SIR, The following tracts, which were entered under Writs of
Mandamus issued by Judge Woodward, having been Suspended, for
Several years, in this Office, it is important that they should, if pos-
sible, be settled, and either confirmed to the claimants, or offered at
public sale. To effect this, you are requested immediately to re-
examine these cases, and see if they will not come within the pro-
visions of the Act of 19* June 1834." In those cases where eighths of
Sections have been entered under writs of Mandamus from Judge
Woodward, and where the requirements of the Act of 29" May
1830,” have been complied with, or, if they can be brought within the
provisions of the Act of 19* June 1834, that is, if Settlement and culti-
vation can be fully proved, as required by either of those acts, this
Office will not hesitate to issue the patents for the eighths referred to,
provided the claimants relinquish all further right to the benefits of
the Several preemption Acts. Where two individuals were settled
upon the Same quarter Section, and were, under Judge Woodward's
decision, permitted to enter two other quarter Sections, making three
eighths to each individual, when the law expressly says, that no indi-
vidual shall be permitted to enter more than one quarter Section, it
will be impossible to act unless the claimants will agree to Surrender
the right to one quarter, and receive patents for the other two, as
tenants in common.

You will observe that by the 7” Section of the instructions from
this Office under the Act of 19* June 1834,” a preemptor is considered
as entitled to enter the two contiguous half quarters, where the im-
provement is situated in different quarter Sections; and that under the
9th Section of the Same instructions, it is considered, that where two
individuals are Settled upon a quarter Section, it may be divided be-
tween them, and each shall be entitled to a preemption of 80 acres of
land elsewhere, &c— By complying with these provisions, such of
the individuals above stated, as have entered two contiguous eighths
of the Same Section, or who have entered eighths of different Sections
may at once receive patents for the Same.
It is probable that the Agent for the Deaf and Dumb Asylum of
Kentucky will withdraw the caveats which were filed against the
issuing of patents for the above tracts, as he stated in a letter to this
Office, dated 20" April 1830," that it is his wish to avoid, as far as
possible, all collision with preemption claimants, I would advise you
to consult with him, as he was written to from this Office upon that
Subject. You will, however, investigate these cases, and receive
Such testimony therein, and also in the foregoing cases, as in your
judgment is respectable, and sufficient to bring them within the provi-
sions of the Acts before referred to; if the claimants upon due
notice being given them. See proper to produce the Same. The
case of Peter W. Guatier should be carefully investigated:—he culti-
vated by his Slaves the NE 3% Sec 19. T 5 N. R. 10 W. but lived in
Georgia. Did he cultivate in 1833, and occupy in 1834, and is this
the only tract to which he lays claim as the original preemptor?
Your immediate attention is requested to these matters.

to be used to compel them to comply with their Treaty Stipulations—
Where the peculiar nature, extent, & exposed state of the Indian
frontier is taken into consideration, it will I think, be readily admitted,
that the force placed under my command is inadequate to enforce a
compliance with their Treaty, & to give such protection to the frontier
settlements, as their apprehensions from the Indians & from another
species of population, induce them to expect from the Government—
Under this view of the subject I am induced respectfully to submit a
few remarks, for the consideration of the General-in-Chief, & if ap-
proved by him, for that of the proper department. I consider the
force already in Florida sufficient to meet & controul the whole of
the refractory Seminoles, if they could be concentrated—But when
scattered over a large extent of country, composed of marshes &
swamps that are almost impenetrable to the white man, it is entirely
inadequate to give that protection & quiet to the frontier inhabitants
which they expect—Frequent applications have already been made,
from different Sections of the country, for protection, in case we should
have any difficulty in removing the Seminoles; & some of the most
respectable planters fear that there is already a secret & improper
communication carried on between the refractory Indians, Indian,
negroes, & some of the plantation negroes—For the better protection
of the frontier settlements, & to stop all intercourse between the
Indians & plantations, in case any difficulty should arise in removing
the Indians, I strongly & respectfully urge & recommend, the calling
into the service of the U. States, for the term of two or three months,
one hundred & fifty mounted volunteers, to be stationed at such
points as the Commanding Officer may think best to effect the object
in view, & not to be ordered within the Indian boundary, unless in
case of absolute necessity—This force to be held ready, but not called
into actual service until required; & to be disbanded as soon as their
services could be dispensed with—This species of force would, in my
opinion, owing to the nature of the country, be the most efficient &
least expensive under all the circumstances of the case, that could be
employed—Being well mounted & all of them good woodsmen & good
riders, & well acquainted with every part of the country-& many of
them deeply interested in its protection—would give them a decided
advantage over any other species of Troops for the kind of service
they would be required to perform; & I have no doubt they could be
raised without any difficulty—I have the honor further to request,
that one of the Revenue Cutters stationed on the Gulf of Mexico, maybe
ordered to cruise along the coast from Charlotte's harbour to Tampa
Bay, between the 1* December & 1" January next, & to cooperate
with Brvt Major Dade's command, in ordering in & securing if neces-

sary, all the Indians they may find on that coast; & on their arrival
at Tampa Bay, to remain subject to the orders of the officer command-
ing the Troops in Florida. A small armed vessel of that class would,
in my opinion, aid our operations very much, & could be placed on
that kind of duty for a short time without the least injury to the
revenue service—The Service assigned me, & the Troops under my
command, is arduous, disagreeable & perplexing, & without the least
prospect of reaping any honor; but it will be cheerfully performed to
the best of my abilities—I feel deeply anxious to remove the Seminole
Nation without resorting to force; but being on the ground, & in pos-
session of all the facts, I feel it my duty to state them for the informa-
tion of the General-in-Chief, & the Department of War, & to give it
as my opinion, that we shall have to strike a blow at the Mickasuky
tribe, before they will surrender the murderers of Dalton, or agree to
comply with their Treaty—This however, will be the last alternative;
but I earnestly request that the Government place the means in my
hands to enable me, when it becomes absolutely necessary, to strike
effectually, & to give protection to the frontier settlements; otherwise
many lives & much property may be lost—

ST AUGUSTINE Fort Marion 17, October 1835.
SIR, The enclosed copy of a letter from Lt Col Fanning ” [Marked
C.] is submitted for the consideration of the General in Chief. My
first wish is to carry out the humane and benevolent views of the Gov-
ernment, in relation to the Seminole Indians in the way most condu-
cive to their happiness and comfort and least expensive to the Nation
with these objects constantly in view. I may have rather under esti-
mated the means necessary to carry into effect the views and plans of
the Government. By refering however, to my letter of the 18"
January last,” You will perceive that I requested that Six Companies
might be added to the Command in Florida, four of which only were
ordered to Fort King. In my Communication of the 8. inst,” I
stated “I considered the force already in Florida sufficient to meet and
control the whole of the Refractory Seminoles if they could be con-
centrated. But when Scattered over a large extent of Country, com-
posed of marshes & swamps that are almost impenetrable to the white
man, it is entirely inadequate to give that protection and quiet to the
frontier inhabitants which they Expect” Since writing the foregoing
20 Copies of the proclamation were sent on Oct. 22, 1835, to the publishers of
the Tallahassee, The Floridian, the St. Augustine, E. Fla. Herald, and the Pensa-
cola Gazette for publication. See post, pp. 193, 520.

I have been informed by Asst Surgeon Archer” that nearly one hun-
dred of the Command now at Fort King have been more or less sick
within the last two or three months and although many of them for
fit for Garrison duty, and most of the others are convalescent, they
cannot be relied on, for active efficient service I therefore have the
honor respectfully to request that three additional Companies be or-
dered to fort King with as little delay as practicable, with an amply
supply of ball and buck shot cartridges. Should this request be com-
plied with, and the Companies ordered from the North it would be
economy of time and money to engage transports drawing not more
than eight feet water to take the Troops direct to the S" Johns river
and land them on the West Side of that river opposity picolata, where
there is a good road leading to Fort King and from which place trans-
portation could be sent to meet them if timely notice is given to the
Commanding Officer at that post.
It is extremely painful to me, to have to allude to myself in any of
my Communications but I am sometimes compelled to do So. It is
now nearly twelve months since I was placed in Command of the troops
in Florida during which time I have now no Staff, not even a private
with me, whose services I could claim except as a matter of courtesy—
It is true that Lt R. P. Smith who I consider one of the first Young
Officers in the Army of his rank has been kind enough to aid me with
his services—but he is now assigned to duty in another section of the
Country and I can no longer avail myself of his valuable Services. A
Colonel Commanding a Regiment has his Regimental Staff to aid him
in the discharge of his duties, I however whilst assigned by the Gen.'
in Chief to an arduous & important command have not even a con-
fidential private to Copy my letters and orders. I hope therefore the
Gen' in Chief will take this Subject under consideration. It is also
in my in opinion of the first importance that an experienced and
efficient officer of the Quarter Masters Department be ordered to join
the Troops in Florida with as little delay as possible”

WAR DEPARTMENT October 22d 1835
BRV* BRIG GEN. D. L. CLINCH, Fort King Florida.
SIR, Your letter of the 8th instant* to the Adjutant General has
been laid before me.
I am well aware of the disagreeable nature of the duties entrusted
to you, but I rely with confidence upon a faithful and judicious exe-
cution of them. It is very desirable to accomplish the object of remov-
ing the Seminole Indians without the application of actual force, and
I cannot but hope that such will be the result.” You will of course
proceed to embark and remove those first who are willing to go,
postponing any decisive course with relation to the refractory ones till
the others have set out. My impression is that they will then all
peaceably follow. Should they not however do so, agreeably to their
treaty stipulations and the arrangements they have entered into with
you, you will proceed to carry into effect your instructions. All proper
remonstrances and representations however should be previously made.
It is out of the question under any circumstances to leave a lawless
banditti, as they would then be if not removed, to form the associa-
tions which you apprehend with the negroes and to involve the frontier
in blood.
I have submitted to the President your proposition for the employ-
ment of a mounted military force, but there is, under existing circum-
stances, no authority for this measure. There is no appropriation
authorizing it, nor can the case yet be brought within the Constitutional
power of the President to call into service an additonal force for the
defence of the country. A few days since, on the representations of
Lieut. Harris, two additional companies were placed at your disposal,
and I have this day directed the Adjutant General to put two more
companies under your orders.” This will give you a force, as I under-
stand from the Adjutant General, of fourteen companies, making an
aggregate of seven hundred. This force, it appears to me, must be
sufficient for all the purposes required.
The President is disposed to direct a revenue cutter to aid your
operations, agreeably to your suggestions, if one can be spared for

protect the Inhabitants from any danger which may threaten them
in such an event.
Much apprehension is already manifested by the community at
large on this subject. And particularly as there are a large number
of Negroes amongst the Indians, who may be under the influence
of the Abolitionists of the North, whose machinations, are now en-
dangering our safety.
Under these circumstances I hope I may be excused for calling on
Your Excellency for such orders as may be deemed proper to avert
the evil alluded to. And that Your Excellency will also provide
me with from two to three Hundred musquets, with their correspond-
ing accoutraments to arm some of the Inhabitants of this City and
Jacksonville, together with Ammunition and the means necessary to
sustain such a force as may have to be called in to active Service.—
Should Your Excellency think proper to Authorize me to adopt
these precautionary measures. I deem it my duty to add, that from
one Hundred and fifty to two Hundred mounted men should be raised
from the several Regts and posted from Spring Garden on the river
S" Johns, thence northwardly to Pilatka, and from that point west-
wardly to the river Suwaney, as a cordon of safety, to prevent the
Indians from coming out of their boundaries and to aid the United
States troops if necessary.
The people of the Country are generally provided with fire arms
of some description or other, but, nevertheless, their appearance in
the field, on such an occasion, should be an imposing one.

11" day of June last two Deputy Surveyors to execute the Decrees
of the Supreme Court made at their January term 1834,” assigning
with said work a sufficient portion of the public land on the Suwannee
River to make their Contracts as I thought at least reasonable, iff
not desirable—The proposition was met by them and the necessary
Contracts and instructions were prepared accordingly to meet their
arrival at the time specified—
When they arrived (about the 10" Ult") I submitted these arrange-
ments for their examination, and I regret to say they declined entering
into the contracts deeming the Survey of those private claims so un-
profitable. I have the satisfaction however to state, that I have
just made an arrangement with another Deputy of experience, to
perform this work, who will enter into contract in all the ensuing
week and proceed for their execution forthwith—I shall forward the
Contract so soon as entered into, together with one other made some
time since for the Survey of the large claim, known as Forbes purchase
decreed by said Court at their last term.
Mr Washington has not yet returned from his tour, owing to in-
disposition as reported by him, and I contemplate that he, together
with M Goldsborough (who surveys the large claim above mentioned)
will survey the residue of the public lands contained in the Diagram
forwarded with my estimate, thus embracing all the work estimated
for during the ensueing year. The surveying of the private claims
under any circumstances is a very laborious and irksome business,

S* AUGUSTINE 3d Nov 1835.
SIR, I have the honor herewith to enclose you a duplicate requisition
for arms, ammunition &c together with a copy of a letter to the officer
in charge of the Arsenal at Augusta Georgia. Should the course I
have taken be informal, be so kind as to direct the officer in charge of
the Arsenal to comply with this requisition, & I will comply with
whatever form may be required.—
An express was sent into me last evening from the S" Johns river,
with a communication signed by several respectable Citizens residing
on that river, informing me, that a few days since, a party of nine
Indians, went to a place on Lake George, well known as the Silver
Spring, and owned by me, but at the time occupied by a M. Switzer,
who was engaged in preparing a very extensive orange Grove, who
after plundering the houses, set fire to, and burnt them to the ground.
At the time this outrage was committed, the place was in the care of
an intelligent Negro, M Switzer, having left the place a few days pre-
vious, in his boat, on business down the river. This outrage, as a mat-
ter of course, has produced a great deal of alarm & excitement in the
country—& I am hourly importuned for protection, arms &c from
every quarter— & I think it absolutely necessary that a few stand of
arms &c. should be sent here with as little delay as possible, to give
confidence to the citizens, & to enable them to defend themselves if
necessary, & particularly so, if I should be authorized to raise the

GENTLEMEN, You will herewith receive a number of copies of a
proclamation of the President of the United States under date of 13"
Ultimo,” directing that a public land sale be held at St Augustine on
Monday the 7" day of March next—You are requested to cause these
hand bills to be distributed throughout the Territory, so as to afford
due public notice of the sale.—
It is believed that a great number of the Townships proclaimed are
not in demand and that sales will be effected in but, comparatively, a
few Townships—Had it been practicable to discriminate between the
lands in demand and those which will not sell, the former only would
have been embraced in the proclamation—As the proclamation offers
more lands than can probably be set up in tracts of half quarter Sec-
tions within the legal period of Two Weeks, you will have to ascertain
before the sale in what townships the demand will be, and only set up
such as are called for—Those which shall not have been offered at
public sale are to be so reported to this office at the termination
thereof—Such will not be subject to private entry until again pro-
claimed and actually offered

GENERAL J. M. HERNANDES Florida Militia S*Augustine
SIR, I have received your letter of the 26" ultimo," enclosing one
from you to the Governor of Florida, respecting calling out a militia
force to defend the frontier against the anticipated aggressions of the
Seminole Indians.
The force under General Clinch will probably exceed seven hundred
men, and in addition to these, one of the public armed vessels has been
ordered to Tampa Bay on his suggestion, to co-operate with him."
It is hoped that these arrangements will be sufficient to induce the
Indians to remove peaceably, agreeably to their treaty stipulations.
As there is no appropriation for calling out the Militia, the President
does not feel authorized to take that measure until the reasons for it
appear more decided than they now do.”

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF
KEY WEST
[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[November 16, 1835]
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress Assembled:
Your memorialists, inhabitants of Key West Florida, respectfully
represent that, on the 8" day of November 1828 the Governor and
Legislative Council of Florida, granted a Charter to the Town of
Key West," which was accepted by the inhabitants and a town gov-
ernment under the said Charter was thereupon organised.—That on
the 2" day of February 1832 the Governor and Legislative Council by
“An Act entitled an act to incorporate the City at Key West,” “ in
several particulars amended and improved the charter of 1828:
and the citizens of Key West having received and accepted the
Said amended and improved charter, a city government was
established agreeably to its provisions—That on the 29" day of
January 1835 the Governor and Legislative Council of the Territory
at the instance of ill disposed persons; while the City government
with police and quarantine powers was duly organised under the said
Charter and the City officers in the discharge of their legal duties,
without notice to the Corporators and against their wishes, repealed
the said Charter thereby depriving your Memorialists of the benefits
and privileges of an incorporation.”—
Your memorialists do not admit the power of the Governor and
Legislative Council to repeal a Charter solemnly granted, accepted
and acted on by the corporators; without notice, against their consent
and wishes and without any alleged infraction or forfeiture of Said
Charter. And if the repealing clause itself be questionable, there
are also penalties and disabilities attached to the Act which are
repugnant to the act of Congress approved March 30" 1822 and
which infringe the restraining clauses of that Act as applied to the
Governor and Legislative Council of Florida, providing “that no ex-
post facto law, or law impairing the obligations of contracts shall

ever be passed, nor shall private property be taken for public uses
without just compensation therefor”
Your memorialists beg leave to refer to the Legislative Act repealing
the Charter of Key West (herewith attached) for palpable evidence of
personal legislation unparalleled in modern times,—for fines and
disabilities leveled against individuals, not designated by name, it is
true, but sufficiently pointed out by reference to their offices.—
The Citizens of Key West have now no benefit of a City government
in preserving peace and good morals or in directing the united energies
of the community to public improvement and comfort: nor have
they quarantine regulations calculated to prevent the introduction
of contagious disease into this exposed position; and in consequence
of resignations there has not been for some time a Justice of the
Peace upon the Island—From the little intercourse with the Seat of
Territorial Government a long time must necessarily elapse and
great inconvenience be felt before these evils can be remedied:—
wherefore your Memorialists pray that the Act of the Governor and
Legislative Council of Florida approved January 29" 1835 be disap-
proved and annulled by an Act of Congress—And your Memorialists
will ever pray &c—

SIR I have the Honor to Acknowledge the receipt of your communi-
cation of the 10" Ins” Conveying the sentiments expressed by the
President in the measures which I deemed it my duty to suggest
consequent on the removal of the Indians from this territory.
The Regular forces which have been ordered on this service, under
Gen Clinch, aught certainly to be sufficient to Convince the Indians
of the fixed determination of the Gov" to remove them; which alone
should be enough to induce them to move peaceably. But, whether
they will be actuated by correct impressions, or become obstinate
and refuse to go at all, are Circumstances, which, with such a people,
Cannot easily be foreseen. Should they refuse to go, and be roused
to Acts of aggression, which their late conduct indicates, much injury
may be done by them before the Troops, unacquainted as they are
with the Country, and being on foot, could possibly come up with
them to prevent it
In this state of uncertainty, it is natural to suppose, that much
apprehension will continue to be felt by the Inhabitants, for the safety
of their lives and property until the removal of these people is fully
accomplished.
I herewith respectfully beg leave to transmit to you the Annext
Copy of a letter of mine to the Colonels Commanding the 2" 4" &
6" Reg" of the Brigade” which I have the Honor to command to-
gether with the reply from Col Warren of the 4**Consisting of the
people of the Counties of Duval & Nassau, that you may see the
measures I am taking for the public safety. And the call which is
made for Arms, of which there is great scarcity throughout the
Country.
As the President does not feel Authorized to call out the Militia
until the reasons for it appear more decided, I have also respectfully
to observe, that in such an event, before orders can be received either

FORT KING 27 Nov 1835.
GENERAL A deep laid plan of villiany is just now developed.
Powell is at the bottom of it. The friendly Chief Charley O Matler *
was last night assasinated. It was also intended that Cohadjo &
Hotatkee OMatler should share his fate. There appears to be a gen-
eral disaffection of the Indians, and, no doubt, War is determined.
I this morning sent F. C° 2"Arty: to the Cattle pens, where the
Indians Cattle were to be disposed of. On learning the fate of Charley
OMatler, I immediately sent an express to Captain Mellon,” who had
commenced his march, to proceed in haste to Wetumpka and join
Capt Graham, and I directed Capt Graham, with the two companies,
to make a forced march to the place of the late Charley OMatler, take
under his protection Charley's family and his tribe, return with all
possible dispatch to Wetumpka and fortify himself, also, to notify
the settlers to be on their guard. Capt Mellon, after performing this
service, was to return to this post.
I am now in a situation of much embarassment, Pay Master Lytle *
with a party of four mounted men, will in a day or two be returning
from Tampa, I fear the worst on their account. To send a soldier
through the country would be folly, and I cannot obtain an Indian or
Negro. If I can possibly find means to convey information, I shall
not only direct Major Lytle not to attempt to pass through the
Country, but also direct the delay of the march of Frasier's " and
Gardiner's "Companies until the arrival of the remaining two com-
panies, already ordered from Tampa; so soon as they may arrive at
that place
Graham's Company marched to Wetumpka on the 18" inst all well;
on the 23” it had nine men prostrated by sickness Six of these I had
brought to this post. We have now more than sixty on the sick report

To the Honorable, the Senate, and House of Representatives of the United

The Memorial of the Grand Jury, for the County of Jefferson Terri-

of the County of Jefferson is wholly unfit for the accommodation of
the Courts, and the transaction of Judicial business, and whereas, also
the Records of the Several Courts, and of the County in their present
condition are subject to many accidents, and the officers intrusted
with the Safe keeping thereof, wholly unable to preseve them in proper
order for the want of Houses suitable for such purpose.
Therefore the Said County of Jefferson is desirous of erecting a per-
manent and commodious Court-House in the Town of Monticello, on
a plan to serve all the conveniences which ought to pertain to such a
building; but inasmuch as the funds of the County are limited, we are
unable to do more than finish the outer work of said building, Where-
fore your Memorialists respectfully Submit this their request, that
your Honorable Body will assist the County in the completion of this
building by an appropriation Sufficient to meet the expences of the
necessary and ornamental work of the building—
This Building will be fitted with two offices for the Clerk and Mar-
shal of the Superior Court, which said offices together with the Court
Chamber will be held subject to the use of the Superior Court and its

GENERAL I now write but know not when, or in what manner
I can convey my letter to you.
It is now a well ascertained fact that Powell was the first man who
fired on Charley O'Matlee, also that you are marked as a Victim;

therefore, be wary, come quickly, but come with force.—I need not
tell you of the practice of the Indians to send out small skulking
parties to way lay their victims.-
Another fact is ascertained.—It is their determination with the
mass of their force to attack this place, they having come to the con-
clusion that nothing effective can be done, whilst we hold it.—On
this score, I feel much less solicitude, than I do for the various detach-
ments I am compell'd to make to protect our supplies on their route,
and secure our communication.—
Permit me to give you at once my decided convictions of what
should be done, and done immediately, raise fifty or one hundred
mounted men with Rifles; pick up every man who is willing to join
you on your march.—Bring Drane's Company. Order in Captain
Grahams' as you come along, and then without a moments delay or
making further arrangements, take every man who can shoulder
a Musket, and dash vigorously on the Big and the Long Swamps.—
My word for it General—any other cause, any delay, will prove
fatal to the lives of many settlers, and probably to ourselves.—If
this blow be not promptly made, then will be the vast expence al-
ready incurred for the removal of the Indians, entirely lost to the
Country but if it be successfully made, then, I think all will move, and
there will be an end of the business.—
I believe that you will now wholly think with me, that if the idea
contained in my letter of, I think, the latter part of August, to strike
upon the Mickasuky's had been followed up, we should not now have
had this horrible state of things
This plot of execrable villany had been nipped in the bud.—
Again I must say—lose no time—make every exertion to reach this
post, where your presence is absolutely necessary.
I have the honor to be, General, with the highest respect Y Ob"
Servant

BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL D. L. CLINCH Fort King, Florida.
SIR, I have just received your letter of the 13th ultimo.”
When I requested in my letter to you of the 20th of October,” that
force should not be applied in the removal of the refractory Seminoles,
until those of the tribe who were disposed peaceably to go had pro-
ceeded to their embarkation, I did not intend to prevent all proper
measures for the apprehension of the Indians who had been con-
cerned in the murder of Dalton. On the contrary I concur fully in
your suggestions that these persons should be arrested without delay.
And you are authorized to proceed in such manner and at such time
as you may judge expedient to arrest them, and to deliver them over
to the civil authority.

HON' LEWIS CASS Secretary at War
SIR. An express arrived at this place on the 6* Instant, bringing
information of such a manifestation of the hostile disposition of the
Seminole Indians, as rendered in my opinion the employment of a
part of the Military force of the contry necessary for the protection
of the inhabitants, residing near the Indian limits.
Through this source I learn that a principal Chief of the nation,
who had made known his determination of delivering up his property,
to the Indian Agent employed by Government to superintend the
removal of those Indians, for the purpose of being sold preparitory to
his removal was put to death by his people," and another Chief averse
to their emigration, chosen in his stead. The habitations of the Indi-

ans in the vecinity of the United States troops were immediately
abandoned, and in two or three nights afterwards an attack was made
by a party of Indians on the House of a white man settler, who
though repeatedly fired at on succeeded in escaping with his fam-
ily, leaving his house to be pillaged, and distroyed by fire.
The apprehensions on the frontier is represented as being so great
that the people have desirted their homes and collected together for
their mutual protection and difence. The regular troops stationed in
the nation, consisting entirely of infantry and very limited in number,
I regard as incompitent to protect so extensive a line of contry.
Their movements must necessarily be slow, and the Indians secure
in their morasses and swamps, may in small bodies penetrate into the
settlements, lay waste the country, and retreat to their hiding places
without ever being brought into action.
Under these circumstances, I have ordered a troop of Baetihted three
hundred mounted riflemen, to be immediately embodied and engaged
in the protection of the Exposed Country, they are instructed not to
enter the Indian limits unless further hostilities are perpetrated on the
White Inhabitants, or in the event of the invasion of the Indian
Country by the United States Troops their services shall be required
by the commanding officer.
I have received no communication either from the United States
Agent stationed in the nation or from Gen Clinch the Officer com-
manding the troops on this subject.
But the numerous applications made to me, from the most respect-
able sources in that section of the Contry, have satisfied me of the
necessity of this measure.
From all the information I have received in relation to the disposi-
tion of the Seminole Indians to comply with the treaty providing for
their emigration I have no doubt that nothing short of compulsion will
induce them to do so; If this course should be determined on and the
requisite force for this purpose cannot be conveniently spared from
other points, a sufficient number of volenteers can be raised in this
Territory for that service.
I have the honor to be Yr Ob*S*

SIR I have the honor to enclose you an extract of a letter from L'
Col" Fanning” commanding at Fort King, from which you will learn
that the Indian Chief Charles O Mathlee was assasinated on the
26" Ulto; This Chief was one of the most Friendly, intelligent, and
leading men of the emigrating Party—and his murder gives stronger
indications in my opinion of a settled plan on the part of those op-
posed to emigrating, to commit violence on the friendly party, than
any thing that has occured within the last twelve months and this
feeling unless promptly checked by the presence of an active and
efficient force, on their northern and Eastern Frontier, will inevitably
extend to the settlements of our fellow Citizens, and result in the loss
of many valuable lives, and the distruction of much property.—The
regular force placed under my Command, is inadiquate to give, the
necessary protection to the inhabitants on our very extended frontier
and to effect the other important objects confided to their care; I
therefore have the honor respectfully to suggest to your Excellency the
importance of immediately calling Out, and placing on the Indian
Frontier; one hundred & fifty mounted men.—This force if ordered to
co,operate with the regular Troops under my Command, will in my
opinion be sufficient to give protection to the frontier settlements
extending from Indian River to the West Bank of the Suwannee.
I have on my own responsibility ordered one hundred musketts &
fifty rifles. Ammunition &c to be sent from Augusta Arsnal to this
place to be used in Case of an emergency.—Last evening a volenteer

SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 27th ultimo.”
The state of affairs in Florida, connected with the Seminole Indians,
appears to be such, as well from the report of General Clinch, as from
your own, that I am induced to accede to your proposition that arms
may be issued from the publick stores, for the defence of the settle-

rect the officer in charge of the arms at the nearest depot, to issue five
hundred muskets with their accoutraments and a proper supply of
ammunition, upon your requisition.—The whole to be accounted for in

FORT DEFIANCE Miconopy Dec. 9. 1835
SIR Since my last letter to the General in Chief,” I have been con-
stantly engaged in travelling through the Country to rouse and or-
ganize a sufficient number of volunteers to give immediate protection
to the frontier settlements. My first object is to throw a sufficient
force on the Indian line to drive these incendiary and murderous
wretches within their limits, and as soon as I am in sufficient force, to
strike a blow at their strong hold. I will teach them, that altho’ the
Government has been heretofore mild and indulgent to them, that it
knows when and how to punish them for their treachery and bad
faith.” It is truly distressing to witness the panic and sufferings of
the white frontier inhabitants. Men, women, and children are seen
flying in every direction, and leaving everything behind them save a
few articles of clothing. Many families that were comfortable and
independent in their circumstances, are now reduced to want; their
houses and their all having been plundered and burned by small bands
of Indians, who have spread themselves through the Country, taking
advantage of their knowledge of the swamps and hammocks to con-
ceal their operations. The first object of every one was to remove
their wives and children to a place of safety, and it was in vain to urge
them to organize and throw themselves in advance of the enemy to
check their progress. Nothing could be done until their families were
secured. I expect one hundred mounted men here to day. These
with the three companies that I shall have on the immediate frontier,
will I think be sufficient to drive the Indians within their boundaries
for a while. The loss of the vessel with our supplies has caused much
inconvenience, as it takes a considerable part of our small force to pro-
* Ante, p. 203.
* In an opinion rendered to the Secretary of War, Mar. 9, 1838 (NA, JD,
Opinions of Attys. Genl.), the Attorney General advised that a public war, within
the Constitution and the rules and articles of war, had existed with the Seminoles
since the day Congress had noted their hostilities and appropriated money to
suppress them. On Jan. 14, 1836, Congress voted $120,000 for the suppression
of the Seminoles; on Jan. 29, 1836, the sum of $500,000 was appropriated; on
Apr. 1, 1836, a like sum was made available; and on Apr. 29, 1836, $1,000,000
was appropriated (5 STAT.1, 8, 17). During the period July 2, 1836-Mar. 3, 1839,
a total of 16 million dollars was made available for the protection of the frontier,
including the Florida area, against Indian attacks.

tect the boats and wagons engaged in transporting provisions. The
uncertainty as to the time when the companies ordered from Louisi-
anna, will reach Tampa, and the distance they will then have to march
through a hostile country before they can join me, induces me to
request that four additional companies be ordered to join me, with
the least possible delay, completely prepared to take the field, with a
good supply of ball and buckshot cartridges. It is also very desirable
to have fifty good muskets and as many rifles sent at the same time,
as there is a great deficiency of arms in the Country. All the informa-
tion I receive in relation to the movements of the Indians, represent
them as being in considerable force, and manifesting a determination
to engage in War, murder, and plunder. It appears also that they are
joined by the negroes, and if they are not promptly put down, this
spirit may extend to the plantations. If additional troops are sent,
they should be landed on the West Bank of the St Johns River, at
Picolata, and march from thence to Fort King."

accomplished by great energy and perseverance. Three more com-
panies from N Orleans & Key West are daily expected. Two comp"
of the garrison here, and two of those expected, are by existing orders
to be detached to Fort King, leaving Dades, Zanzingers & my own
for this defence, perhaps 90 effectives. The sick reports are large from
fevers & inflamatory diseases. The garrison with about 100 citizens &
families, are every night within the pickets, as well as the publick
property. The supply of ammunition is scanty, for musquetry as well
as for our 2 6-pdrs.
A few hours since about 40 Indians, joined (with horses and families)
our friendly party, across the river. Before this may leave (via Pen-
sacola by return of our Transport) I may be able to report whether
they are driven in, or that whether they are seceders from the hostile
party, and indicate a dissolution of the mass. Our communications
with Fort King are entirely broken up, and we have no expectation of
communicating before the detachment of four companies, may force
it. Our Quarters supply of provisions may hold out—Indians will
receive rations for work, but as prudently as possible.
About 30 Citizens (of families taking refuge here) have assumed an
organization as rangers, and furnish patrols (mounted) by which the
approaches are well observed during the earliest morning, or other
hours, or circumstances indicating an attack—The Suttlers (Capt
Saunders) country store 30 miles from this was plundered a short time
back & three nights since, the crop & dwellings of M" Simmons, a
planter, were burnt.
Great confidence is felt by all, that an attack if seriously meditated
must fail, & by such a result materially aid the interests of the
government.

DIRECTORS OF THE EAST FLORIDA RAILROAD COMPANY
[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[December 14, 1835]
To the Honourable the Senate and the House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled.—The memorial of the
undersigned being the President and a Majority of the Directors of
the East Florida Rail Road Company, a Corporation duly established
by a Law of the Territory of Florida, approved on the 14th of February
A D 1835,” for the purpose of constructing a Rail Road from the
Waters of the Atlantic Ocean, through the Territory of Florida, to
those of the Gulf of Mexico, respectfully represents;—That the
Governor and Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, at the
last Session, passed certain resolutions recommending the enterprize
in which your memorialists are engaged,” to the favourable notice
of Congress, and asking in their behalf an appropriation of lands in
aid of the work. That this recommendation was made, not merely
with reference to the local benefits to accrue to the Territory of
Florida, but to the greater advantages which the whole Country will
derive from the Completion of the Road, which, in their opinion,
entitled it to the favourable consideration of Congress. The resolu-
tions referred to not having been received in Season for the action of
Congress, at the last Session, the wishes of the Legislative Council
were but partially fulfilled, by a grant of so much land, by Congress, as
Comprehended the site of the Road, together with thirty feet on each
side thereof.” Your Memorialists therefore respectfully ask, that
these resolutions may be called up, at the present Session, and receive
the favourable consideration of Congress.
The Company in asking of Congress a compliance with the resolves
of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, do it, less on
the principle of asking a direct donation from Congress, than on that
of an equitable grant of a portion of the benefits which the United
States will derive from the outlay of the capital of the Company, by
the enhanced value given to the public lands, Contiguous and adjacent
to the line of the Road, and to the benefits they will receive in the
transportation of Troops, munitions and the Public Mails. These
benefits are certain to accrue to the United States, if the work be
completed, but the profits on, and even the reimbursment of, the
Capital of the Company, are uncertain, depending on numerous

prudence. If there had been authority for raising the 150 mounted
men, recommended by me last Summer, the frontier settlements
would at this time, have been quiet; a great deal of property saved
& much distress prevented—It is also very much to be regretted as
our Indian affairs have taken the course they have, that the four
additional companies had not have been ordered from the Atlantic
instead of the Gulph, as in that event, they could have joined before
this, & I should have been in force to have opperated as soon as a
sufficient quantity of provisions could have been placed in store at
Fort King. As it is, it is impossible for me to form any idea when
they will arrive at Fort Brooke, between which place & Fort King,
a distance of one hundred miles, through the centre of the disaffected
& hostile part of the Seminole Nation, there is no communication, the
Indians having in several instances, stopped the runners, taken and
broken open the letters—Thus you will perceive, when the seven
Companies assemble at Fort Brooke, that my force will be equally di-
vided & neither strong enough to effect much in a Country like this—
As soon however, as the Volunteers called out by the Gov. of Florida
arrive, I will not delay a moment, but strike at once at their Strong-
hold. The last report from Brev. Major Dade, he was to leave Key
West in the Schr: Motto, on a short leave of absence from Lt. Col.

retreat to post with the loss of one man killed, and one wounded.
Believing that the frontier could only be Succesfully protected by

tender them to the number of five hundred men, that a force adequate
to this purpose might be in readiness if required by the U.S. Officer in

may approach in to the midst of the Settlements by ascending the
rivers in their canoes has induced me to adopt measures for their re-
moval or expulsion from this Section of Country although I have not
heard of any act of hostility being committed by them. As this can
not be done alone by a land force as they would be able readily to de-
feat pursuit by resorting to Their Boats, and as the Shallowness of the
water on the coast will not permit a vessel of any Size to be employed
I have made application to the Commanding Officer of the West
India Squadron and of the Navy Yard at Pensacola for a detachment
of boats to Cruise along the coast and up the river &c. to intercept
their retreat.
I will in the mean time however cause them to be communicated
with through an interpreter, and if found to be friendly will cause them
to be accompanied by a force Sufficient for their protection to Tampa
Bay for the purpose of being embarked. The Sum of three Thousand
Dollars has been advanced by the Receiver of public money's at this
place for the furnishing and provisioning the Florida volunteers.

CAMP NEAR FORT DEFYANCE 22nd December 1835
Head Quarters Florida Volenteers
SIR Having heard of the distress and I aha alarm on this frontier
occasioned by Indian depridation, I raised a detachment of 250
Volenteer mounted rifle men from my Brigade and under the orders
of the Acting Governor proceded to this border, where I found about
the same number of men under the command of Col" Warren of the
East Florida Melita. I have assumed command of the whole making
my force about five hundred men. They were raised however for
only four weeks, and many of them are badly armed and equiped.
The services of these Troops have been tendered to Gen Clinch, and
accepted for the prospect of protecting the frontier, I eah I can Sir
scarcely give you an adiquate discription of the frontier Inhabitants.
The whole country between the Suwannee and the S* Johns Rivers
for the distance of fifty miles above the Indian boundry is abandoned,
the fronter inhabitants shut up in a few miserable stockade forts and
the Indians traversing the Country at will burning & distrying where
ever they appear. Before my arrival a number of scrummishes had
taken place in which the Indians were invariably successful. A few
days since a Detachment of Col" Warrens command while on their
march in the margin of the Alachua Savannah, was attacked by a
party of Indians. His baggage guard was defeated and his baggage
captured. Two days after I marched on the same ground, recovered
one waggon a carryall and the greater part of the baggage, I had
intended to Camp that night at a house within one mile of fort De-
fyance Formerly called Micenopy where there was a supply of corn
& fodder. when my spies and advance guard approached they ob-
served a house on fire they pressed foward and found the trale of
a small party of Indians leading into a thick hammock they gave
pursuit and drove them into a hahameek pond in which there was
a thick undergrowth and a number of trees in which a htthaber ef the
Indians were concealed. The volenteers lead by Col" Read the
Brigade Inspector galantly entered the water and fought most bravely
at half pistol shot as long as an Indian or the flash of his gun could
be seen when the fight was over we found but four of the enemy killed.

my loss was four wounded among these was Capt" Lancaster of the

fighting bravely in the front of the action. They were are all doing
well except one of the privates whose wound I fear is mortal. I have
this moment received an express informing me that the Indians have
crossed the Suwannee River and are now burning and distrying at
the the old town. Many of my men are drawn from that quarter

A large body of Regulars & volunteers have marched to the Indian
Country about 150 miles south and east, but I am of opinion they will
not effect much as the Indians will fly to the swamps and marshes
where troops cannot go, and from their places of concealment will
occasionally come out and do much mischief.—They will also try to

of public money to the use of the Militia of the territory of Florida,

portions of the militia as General Clinch may require for the purpose
of repressing the hostilities of the Indians, and of affording security
to the frontiers. As soon as the necessary information as to the ex-
penditures can be obtained, an Appropriation will be asked of Con-
gress to meet the expenses incurred under these instructions.

DSIR Most painful intelligence has been received to day from the
Main land, of the massacre of two Companies U. S. Troops. with all
their Officers, while marching from Tampa Bay to Fort King."—
Intelligence has also been received that the Indians in the Vicinity of
Cape Florida have likewise massacred a family on the Coast, and that
the Inhabitants of all the Settlements in that vicinity are removing
down towards Key West.—
As we are in a very unprotected State, in consequence of the re-
moval to Tampa Bay, of the Troops and amunition of the Govern-
ment;" public meetings have been called to devise measures for the
protection of ourselves and the other Inhabitants of the Islands; and
among others adopted, it has been proposed to apply to whatever
Vessels of War, there may be in Havana, for the Security their pres-

presume, address you immediately on the Subject and you will allow

protection can be afforded them in case of necessity. Under ordinary
circumstances I should have consulted the department, and have
obtained its approbation of this measure before I acted, but I consider
both my family and my office in danger from the peculiar situation
of the place on the frontier settlements, and to wait the tedious transit
of the mail to and from Washington City to obtain its approval might
involve me in irretrieveable difficulties.
The Indians have fully made known their hostile intentions by
refuseing to comply with the terms of the treaty made for their re-
moval the limitation of which has expired, by killing all white persons
who come in their way, laying waste and burning plantations and
houses. The loss of lives and property has already been great, and
their ravages have just commenced. Their success in two engage-
ments seems to embolden to further depredations. They are repre-
sented to have two thousand warriers in the field, and altho will not
allow themselves to be brought into fair array. They will neverthe-
less fear, for sometime to come, do vast damage by Sallies from their
numerous hideing places upon the coast. All the families of the
place that are able have left it for more tranquil abodes, and under
the peculiar circumstances of the case I am confident mine will not be
made an exception by the act of the department
So soon as a better state of things exist, they will resume their
residence at the port of Entry. The office, will of course be continued
at Magnolia with such papers laws &C. (except those which for safety
I will also remove) as is necessary for its business, the duties of which

bring us out of the difficulties into which we have been thrown—I
stand myself but a spectator of scenes in which I have not participated;
though still ready, as I ever have & ever shall be, to peril my life in
the service of my Country—But that spirit of proscription; which has
directed its shafts even against the humble writer of these lines; has
made him an object even to be shunned by all the Public officers you
have sent here, and thinking they cannot do a more acceptable office
to you; they avoid the Counsel, or aid of him whom you have pro-
nounced unfit for Station—Be it so; I feel not the less for my Country
& my home, Everything I hold dear in this world is in this Territory,
& I regret to see it brought to the unhappy condition in which it now
is—I would Cheerfully render any service & stand prepared to do my
part with those who in the performance of duty look to the general
good and not to individual agrandisement—But enough of this—To
the Facts—The Army of volunteers & Regulars have met the Enemy
at the Withlacouchey & after a sharp contest for one hour seperated,
as it were by consent—The Army retiring to their old Camp at Lang
Syne, & the Indians remaining on the field of Battle—Since which the
Volunteers have returned home leaving Clinch with his regular force
reduced 40 or 50 by death or wounds in position on the frontier—In the
mean while the Indians have been encouraged & have burnt & de-
stroyed the whole country to the St Johns River—In this quarter
since the return of the Volunteers we have been standing still: nothing
doing & no probability of an adequate force volunteering for service—
Indeed, I doubt much whether anything will or can be done by us;—&
therefore we look with deep solicitude to the General Government
with a hope that some decesive & efficient measures will be taken at
Washington—I fear from present appearances that the Conquering
the Indians & removing them from the Territory; which will be a
necessary consecutive to the first, will now require time & the presence
of an Active force of Mounted Rangers to cooperate with Infantry &
Riflemen—I therefore previously suggested & again invite your at-
tention to the subject of a Regiment similar to Dodges " Rangers to
operate on the Florida & Creek frontier, untill the Seminoles be sub-
dued & both Creeks & Seminoles finally removed from the Country—
Something of this kind will be necessary—The People here cannot
leave their business, or will not voluntarily to fight the Indians—At
all events those who would volunteer would be too small in numbers
to effect the object—

troops in that quarter, to join their respective companies without
delay. Four of your Assistants have been accordingly removed, and
among these are Lieutenants Stockton and Henderson. This will
deprive you of the means, of doing more at present in reference to the
Road from Pensacola to Columbus, than the reconnoisance upon
which you are now engaged."
As it is presumed this will soon be completed, I have to call your
attention and to direct your service, in the execution of a law of
Congress in reference to the opening of a road from the Alabama line,
through Mariana to the town of Appalachicola.”
Inclosed you will receive the maps, and copies of the reports and
laws in reference to the subject.
As there does not remain more than 9.000 dollars of the appropria-
tion to be expended in the opening of the Road, you will limit your
operations to that part of the survey which lies between Appalachicola,
and the point where the survey is intersected by the road from the
Head of St Andrew's Bay.”
The object is to open a common country road, and the appropriation
being small, it is not supposed, that you will be able to give any at-
tention to ditching, or to the construction of bridges, but that you
will have to confine yourself merely to the cutting out, or in other
words, to the removal of the timber and undergrowth from the width
of the road.
In the execution of this duty you will be governed by the following
rules:
1* Sandy parts—these requiring shelter from the sun, will be
thirty feet wide.
2" Clay or damp parts—These requiring exposure to the sun will
not be less than sixty feet wide.
3" No Stumps to be left above the surface of the road, the small
growth to be cleared out also, and no refuse from felling of timber,
cutting or grubbing, to be left in the width of the road.
The work must be done by contract, and no money will be paid
* A report by Graham to the President and directors of the Alabama, Georgia
and Florida Railroad on a survey for a route for a railroad from Pensacola to
Columbus, Feb. 6, 1836, is printed in H. Doc. 176, 24 Cong., 1 sess., pp. 2–8.

JUDGE CAMERON TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[NA:SD, Misc. Lets.:ALS]
PENSACOLA W. F. Jam: 28th 1836
HON: JOHN FORSYTH
DEAR SIR! Allow me to draw your attention to a subject in which
I have some interest, and in which, I look for justice, chiefly through
your Agency.
Congress has thought proper, for the last two years, to withdraw
from the Judges of Middle and West Florida the extra allowance, for
determining Land Claims, to which, under existing Laws, they were,
in my Opinion, entitled. The Act of Congress of 26* May 1824 *
(and which is made applicable to Florida, by subsequent enactments)"
makes it imperative upon the Judge of the District Court of Missouri
to adjudge certain Land Claims, and allows him $800 per Annum, in
addition to his salary. In Florida these duties were required, and the
extra allowance made to all the Judges untill the Session of 1833,”
when it was witheld from me & the Judge of Middle Florida, while
it has continued to the Judges of the Eastern & Southern Districts.
It is true, that in East and South Florida, more of the Land Claims
remained to be adjudicated than in West or Middle Florida, but be-
cause the Judges of these two Districts had been more rapid in their
decrees, it was no reason why, having gone through most of these
Cases, they should have been put upon a worse footing than the other
two Judges. Besides, in West as well as in Middle Florida, Cases of
this kind have never ceased to be upon the Dockets of the Court,
and to this Moment, there are Cases in my District, upon which, I
am called, at each session of the Court, to make some order. I
cannot, for a Moment, believe that the Government or Congress
wishes the Officer of the Law to perform duties without paying them
a fair Compensation for their services, and must Conclude, that the
witholding the extra allowance, hitherto, from the Judges of Middle
104 STAT. 52–56.
11 Sec. 6, act approved May 23, 1828 (4 STAT. 285).

and West Florida, by Congress, was from want of due information.
I ask for this Additional Compensation, not only because I think that
I have a right by Law to receive it, but because my ordinary duties
are so disproportionate to the ordinary salary which I receive. Judge
Reid has arduous duties to perform, and he richly earns every Cent
that he receives from Government, and more: yet Judge Reid has not
half the travelling that I am Compelled to perform—he has not as
many Courts to attend, yet besides his regular salary & his extra
allowance he is allowed by Congress upwards of $1500 a year for Office
rent, Clerk hire & translator. Judge Webb has only one Court to
attend, besides the Court of Appeals, yet he receives his ordinary salary
of $2000, together with his extra allowance of $800. Pray, cast your
eyes upon the Map of Florida & look at my District! I have to hold
Courts in five Counties, twice a year, besides on yearly term of the
Court of Appeals: my travelling is more than 2000 Miles in the year
I am from home, on my official duties, more than 6 Months in the year:
from the nature of the Country & the distance of my Courts, my travel-
ling is not only great & fatiguing, but my health and even life are often
hazarded. And yet, for this I receive the salary of $1800 only, without
any perquisites or allowances. Such inequalities should not exist. I
beg you not to suppose, for a Moment, that I am objecting to the salary
of Judges Reid and Webb; far from it: they receive no more than what
they are justly entitled to, and yet, with due deference, I should think,
that Congress should do justice to the other Judges.
If you see this Matter in the light in which it presents itself to me,
I hope you will suggest to Congress to make an Appropriation whereby
I shall receive, at once, $1600 for the years 1834 & 1835, and $800 for
the year 1836 to be paid quarterly, with the ordinary salary.
I am much obliged to you for the interest you have manifested in
getting a Warrant for my son at West Point. I was much mortified
that the [MS. torn] has made his rule to operate upon my son, (the
rule to exclude all who were not 16 years of age) while others were
admitted under 16. However, it is best perhaps, as it is, and by
Another year, the reason will not prevail—my son will be better pre-
pared—and I hope, he then, will find no difficulties to his Admission.
I pray you to accept Assurances of the very high regard with which
I have the honor to be
Your friend & mo: ob: s”

W. A. WHITEHEAD. Esqr. Collector. Key West, Florida.
SIR, I have received your letter of the 15th instant," conveying an
account of the state of things in the Southern part of Florida, and at
Key West. Major General Scott has been ordered to the theatre of
hostilities, with full power to employ as much force as will be necessary
to subdue the Indians, and to remove them immediately from the
country. I am sure he will push his operations with great prompti-
tude and vigor. And I trust the difficulties in that quarter will soon
be terminated, not again to recur. I understand from the Secretary
of the Navy, that Commodore Dallas has reached Key West, and that
he has avowed his intention to remain there, in order to afford you
the necessary protection. In the meantime I have requested General
Scott" to detach a garrison to reoccupy Key West, as soon as he can
do so. I have also directed the Ordnance Department, to forward
without delay, 150 stand of arms, together with the necessary ammu-
nition, to the direction of the Commanding Officer, if there is one at
Key West, and if not, to your care."

WASHINGTON Feby 9. 1836.
SIR, In consequence of the nomination of Judge Randall not having
been made in due season, an entire term of the Court of Appeals has
been lossed to the Territory of Florida. This combined with the cir-
cumstance that few cases were decided at the term before the last, and
the fact, that the Court only sits once a year, has produced serious
embarrassment in the Territory.
To remedy this as far as practicable I have proposed a Bill to author-
ize a special term on the first Monday in May. I have just learned
14 NA (WD, SW Reg. of Lets. Recd., W97), text not found.

Sent, Mil. Bk. 18; printed, A.S.P., Mil. Affairs, VI, 1043–1044), ordering Scott to
assume command of the troops in Florida Territory, together with instructions.
Scott arrived at Augusta, Ga., Jan. 30, at Savannah on Feb. 9, and at Picolata,
Florida Territory, Feb. 21, 1836, which was the date he assumed command of the
Florida troops (ibid., VII, 223, 231, 238). The volume cited contains a vast quan-
tity of relevant correspondence (pp. 125–366) which was utilized by the Military
Court of Inquiry into Scott's conduct.

TO GEN THO" S. JESUP, Q.M. General,
SIR, In the 2" day of December ultimo, I received orders from Gen.'
Clinch, to proceed with “D” Company 2" Artillery to the Indian
Nation. The order was given on the 2" to march on the 3' by great
exertion I succeeded in obtaining the necessary means of transporta-
tion. It however left me, no time to settle anything relative to the two
appropriations under my charge, to wit: The appropriation for “re-
pairing the Military Road, from Tallahassee to St: Augustine F*””
and the appropriation for “Clearing out the Ocklawohaw River.””
On my departure I left a party of 35 men in charge of my assistant J.
Haslain at work on the road between Picolato & St. Augustine, with
instructions to prosecute the work agreeably to instructions which I
had previously given him, until the 31* of December'35, at which time
I directed him to close the accounts as far as possible, without my
presence. A few days after my departure for the Seminole Territory,
the excitement and alarm became so great, that all the hands I had at
work, were ordered into the Military Service by the Gen' commanding
the district, thereby breaking up the Party, of which I was immedi-
ately notified by my assistant. I have however, in consequence of

the duties which devolved on me, on my arrival at this post, been
unable to visit St. Augustine, for the purpose of settling the accounts—
A visit of a few days will at any time enable me to close them—and
the first opportunity will be seized for that purpose.
Relative to the appropriation for the Ocklawahaw River—I made
the necessary arrangements early in November for all the necessary
machinery Tools, &c. and provisions for 50 men for 4 months to be
shipped to Palatkia on the St. Johns River—Previous to their arrival,
the Seminole Indians commenced hostilities and on the 4” of Decem-
ber I was fortunate in intercepting the Steamboat at Picolata, with
all the above articles on board, and caused them to be landed and
stored at that place, instead of allowing them to be carried up to
Palatkia, which place was burned by the Indians a few days after.
Had they been taken to Palatkia they would have all been sacrificied—
I had in November received 3 lighters, at Palatkia (built by contract)
for the work. They were left at Palatkia in charge of the gentleman
inhabiting that place—but since the Desertion and burning of that
place, I have little hopes that they have escaped—However I have
received no definite information since then relative to them, as the
river above Picolata is entirely deserted. I should have commenced
the work on the 15" of December, had these unfortunate difficulties
not arisen—It has in consequence been entirely out of my power to
render returns relative to either of the above appropriations, and with
a knowledge of my situation, I must throw myself on the indulgence
of the Department. So soon as these difficulties are ended, I hope,
should I retain my scalp to the end, to prosecute the above works,
with the approbation & to the satisfaction of the Department.
Lieut Heintzelman reported to me for duty in the Q Masters De-
partment in the early part of January, and in consequence of the un-
settled state of the country—I directed him to take the post at St.
Francis Barracks, St. Augustine and await for further orders. All of
which I hope will meet the approbation of the Department.”

[LC:Pensacola Gazette, March 12, 1836]
WASHINGTON, February 16, 1836.
DEAR SIR.—I found it was impossible to create a fifth Judicial
District in the Territory of Florida. There is but one Marshal and
District Attorney in either of the other Territories, and we have four.
In nearly all the other Territories which have heretofore been
organized, there has been but one Court held for the whole Territory
at the Seat of Government; which, suitors and jurymen are obliged
to attend at the distance of 300 miles. The practice of having Su-
perior Courts in every County, was never permitted in any other
Territory before ours. The Judiciary expenses in Florida, exceed
that of any other's, more than 30,000 dollars a year. Under these
circumstances, although we obtained the favorable report of a com-
mittee last year,” it was impossible to hope for the passage of the bill.
Indeed I ascertained that the committee would not even report it
again this year, being composed of different members—They con-
sidered that such was the extent of the Western District, and the
great necessity of the Judge remaining at Pensacola longer in each
year than such an extensive circuit would permit, in consequence of
its being the rendezvous of our navy, and an important maratime
port where a Court of Admiralty should always be open, that the
next best thing that could be done would be to add the county of
Franklin to the Middle Judicial District, and dispense with two terms

have been destroyed, but we cannot expect to receive information

be applied to the repair of both roads and bridges while the troops are

& Dade; remonstrating against the multiplication of expenses, duties,
inconveniences &c arising from the measure,—praying Congress to
interfere, and by annulling the law, to reinstate them in their former
privileges and circumstances—
You will doubtless imagine that we must be but badly represented
in the Territorial Legislature to require so repeatedly the action of
Congress to prevent the execution of laws unnecessary—inexpedient
and burthensome to the people.—That we are so is not the fault of
those who reverence the laws that tend to the well-being of society and
which are calculated to improve the condition of this portion of the
Territory; and unfortunately, the Legislative Council are too prone to
listen to petitions and memorials that have been secretly prepared
without considering the effects that will result from the operation of the
laws based upon them.
So long as this continues to be the case, the aggrieved must trust
to the wisdom and Justice of Congress for the necessary supervision
over their rights and privileges in order that they may be protected
in the enjoyment of both.—
The memorial that went on to the Council for the division of the
County, was not signed, so far as I can learn, by one person residing
this side of Indian Key:"—or in other words, by any one who would
not be immediately benefitted by the measure; and without the knowl-
edge of the great body of the people inhabiting the County was sent to
Tallahassee and received the attention of the Legislature before any
steps could be taken to oppose it—This alone should operate against
the division, but the people have more substantial reasons as you will
observe on reference to the petition—
Our mutual friend Judge Webb was at Tallahassee at the time the
bill was under consideration, and knowing the great difficulty which
has always attended the obtainment of Jurors, suggested to a member
the propriety of making the Jurors of either County competent Jurors
in the other.—An amendment of the kind was presented but objected
to as it would “defeat the very object of the bill”—
If such is the fact, the “object of the bill” must be to put an end to
all criminal trials and important civil causes in the whole Southern
District;—making this the theatre for the performance by every vil-
lain who may choose to profit by the circumstance—of every crime
and misdemeanor without his being made to suffer the penalties of
any law.—
Being yet unprovided with a copy of the law, we cannot point out
its particular provisions. We are however, satisfied that such a bill

has passed and whatever may be its nature, so long as it operates to
effect a division of the County of Monroe as formerly established, is
uncalled for by the necessities of the people and contrary to the wish
of a large majority;—calculated to benefit a few at the expense of the
many;—and is subversive of the good of society by rendering it more
difficult if not entirely impossible to punish wickedness and vice
within the District.—Under these circumstances it becomes the duty
of every good citizen to procure if possible, the disapprobation of
Congress to the Act, and I feel no hesitation in calling for your aid to
effect the desired end.—

Petition and Remonstrance to Congress by Inhabitants of Monroe
and Dade Counties
[February, 1836]
To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled—
The petition and remonstrance of the undersigned, inhabitants of
the Counties of Monroe and Dade in South Florida, respectfully
represents that, the County of Monroe as formerly established,
comprehended the chain of small Islands along the Florida Reef and
a part of the main land:—that the principal body of the inhabitants
of this County was, and is yet to be found at Key West: a few families
only, residing in the vicinity of Cape Florida and a few more
upon the Islands most of which are still uninhabited:—that there
has always been a difficulty in obtaining a competent number of legal
jurors for the civil business of the Court in this District, and after

excluding the grand jurors and twenty allowed by law for peremptory
challenges, it has ever been found impossible to enter into a criminal
trial for capital offences:—that by law the Superior Court for this
District holds two sessions per annum at Key West for jury trials:
and owing to the length of the County, and the fact that all legal
jurors were called on at every term, the jury duty has been extremely
burthensome, taking those who lived at a distance from the place
of holding Court at least one twelfth of the year from their homes and
employments.”—
Yet the Legislative Council of the Territory at their last session
have passed an Act dividing Monroe County, so as to set off Indian
Key” and the settlements east of it as a new County to be called
Dade, and ordering two terms per year of the Superior Court to be
held at Indian Key.—This will double the Jury service, already oppres-
sive, if indeed any business can be transacted in Court: for if all the
jurors of the District are not assembled, no criminal business whatever
can be transacted.—We fear that several matters now on the calendar,
must be dismissed to the detriment of the public morals if the present
division of the County continued.—
Your petitioners would respectfully state that had it been known
an application for a division of the County was pending before the
Council strong opposition would have been made to the passage of
the act.—They remonstrate against this early and unnecessary multi-
plication of Counties, as imposing on them needless burthens and
expenses, which are not required for the public convenience.—The
County of Dade as now established, will not embrace within its limits
Ten families, even after those, who have fled from the main land on
account of Indian hostilities shall have returned to their homes.—As
Indian Key and all its buildings belong to one individual, the holding
two terms of the Superior Court there per annum, may possibly
benefit one man, but it will double the burthens of every other in
both counties.—
Your petitioners therefore pray, that the Act of the Governor and
Legislative Council of Florida to establish the County of Dade in
South Florida be disapproved and annulled by act of Congress, as
being premature, inexpedient, and extremely oppressive to the
people:—and they will ever pray &c

SIR, I have the honor to enclose you, a Resolution of the Governor

that the City of St Joseph shall be made a Port of Entry & delivery.
It is known to you that Congress alone have the power to establish
a port of entry, which will no doubt be done as soon as it is ascertained,
that there is any foreign Commerce to justify it.
I have presented this resolution in the House of Representatives
and had it printed, and referred to the Committee of Commerce who
will give to it such attention as it may be found to deserve.”

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF MONROE
COUNTY
[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:DS *]
[March 1, 1836]
To the Honourable the Congress of the United States.
We the undersigned inhabitants of Monroe County, Territory of
East Florida, crave permission to represent, That in consiquence of
the great inconvenience & disadvantage to many of us who reside at
the north & eastern part of this county, in being obliged to attend as
Jurors at Key West twice every year at seasons when our presence is
most required at our places of residence with no other means than small
open boats to travel by water a distance of between two & three
hundred miles, subject to all the ill consiquences of exposure to bois-
terous & disagreeable weather, with great hazard attending such a
mode of travelling for at least ten days & frequently owing to head
winds exceeds two weeks.
To alleviate our burthens the Legislative Council of this Territory
during their last session passed an act to divide Monroe County, And
while we felt peculiarly greatful of being thus relieved of so great a
grievance, we did not for a moment entertain a doubt but that every
man in this county would feel the same degree of gratitude.—And far,
very far from our thoughts did we for once believe that any person or
persons would manifest the least disposition or wish to abrogate such
a law.—But to our great astonishment & surprise a petition has been
drawn up at Key West & sent to the Honorable the Congress of the
United States to have this Act repealed;* what motives they may have
in desiring this law revoked we do not pretend to say, but it is to be
feared that a due regard for the interest of the settlers in the remote
part of the county is lacking.
It is well known that this county is coming rapidly into notice, for
the cultivation of sugarcane, sea island Cotton, Tropical Fruits, the
Mulberry tree & rearing the silk worm, to which the climate & soil
are both peculiarly applicable, perticularly at, and in the vicinity of

Cape Florida, New River & Indian River, and although the settlements
at each of those places have recently been abandoned in consiquence
of Indian incursion, twelve families from Cape Florida & New River,
and also twelve families from Key Vaccas have all fled to Key West
for protection, Indian Key is the only settlement within the new
county not abandoned, We have been able to keep our stand, with ,
our own inhabitants consisting of forty men under arms, and from forty
to fifty men at our command that are attached to vessels owned at
Indian Key, all of which men are residents of this county, & qualified
voters. And it is sincerely hoped & fondly anticipated that the time
is not far distant, when the red men will be obliged to give up their
hostilities, and not only those who have left their homes will return,
but many more will soon become settlers of this county.
The boundaries of Monroe County before it was divided will we
trust, be sufficient to prove the importance of having the Act alluded
too, to remain unaltered—The line commencing at Boca Gasperilla
the mouth of Charlotte harbour on the Gulf of Mexico and extending
up the northern margin of said Charlotte harbour to the mouth of
said Charlotte river, thence up the northern margin of said river to
Lake Macaco, thence along the northern margin of Line to the head
waters of Potomac river, thence down said river to its entrance into
the Ocean, together with all the Keys and Islands of the Cape of
Florida.—From the north eastern boundary of the County to Key
West, is a distance of three hundred miles, from Key West to the
western boundary is seventy miles. We therefore pray that the Act
passed by the Honourable the Legislative Council of the Territory
of Florida for having Monroe County devided, may continue
uninterrupted.

REMONSTRANCE TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF
MONROE COUNTY
[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:DS]
[No date, 1836]
To the honorable, The Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States, in Congress Assembled.
The undersigned, inhabitants of Monroe County, in the Southern
District of Florida, respectfully represent; That they are informed,
that Jacob Housman, the proprietor of Indian Key, in said district, is
causing petitions to be presented to your honorable bodies; praying
that Indian Key may be made a port of Entry. The undersigned
beg leave respectfully to remonstrate against the prayers of these
petitions. They desire to state to your honourable bodies, that they
reside upon the Southern Coast of Florida; that they are acquainted
with its topography; its Commerce; and the wants and wishes of its
people; and they deem the passage of a law establishing a port of
Entry at Indian Key, impolitic, unnecessary, against the wishes of
a vast Majority of its inhabitants, and as calculated to diminish the
Revenue of The United States.
The following, are among the many reasons for their opinion:
By referring to the Chart of the Southern part of Florida, it will be
seen that there is a chain of islands, extending from Cape Florida to
the Tortugas; a distance of about one hundred & Sixty Miles. These
Islands vary in their distance from the Main land, from ten, to Sixty
Miles. Their soil is generally sterile, and incapable of profitable

cultivation. Their inhabitants, therefore, export nothing beside
wrecked property, except live fish, turtle, and a little Salt, which is
begun to be Manufactured at Key West. They subsist principally
by fishing, turtling and wrecking; that is, saving vessels and cargoes
that may be cast ashore upon the reefs.
The entire population of these Islands, by a census taken in April
last, was nine hundred and Thirty Two; of which number, about six
hundred reside at Key West; and over two hundred at Key Vaccas.
The Main land south of Tampa Bay, is entirely unexplored and un-
settled; and must remain so for several years to come. Key West,
situated about midway of this Chain of Islands, is already a port of
Entry; and one port of Entry is deemed sufficient to supply the reason-
able wants of the few inhabitants of these Islands. If another port of
Entry should be deemed necessary for these Isalands, Indian Key is
not the most suitable place for it. It has an area of only eleven
acres, measuring to low water mark; & excepting one small lot, occu-
pied by the Inspector of the Revenue, it belongs to Jacob Housman.
It has been settled twelve years, and it contains but one store, one
Grog shop, one merchant, four families, ten white men and no more.
It is openly exposed to the sea; and possesses little or no harbor, for
vessels drawing over six and a half feet water. True, vessels drawing
fifteen feet may cross the Reef and approach within a mile of Indian
Key. But they are then in no other harbor than exists in a channel
seven or eight miles wide between the reef and the Islands, which is
always considered unsafe for merchant vessels; and the advantages
of which are equally possessed by every island on the coast. There
are more than a dozen better harbors, admitting larger drafts of water,
among these islands. Bahia Honda, Key West and Tortugas are safe
harbors, possessing deep channels and admitting from the sea the
heaviest class of armed vessels. Key Vaccas possesses a better
entrance, a safer harbor, more shipping, a greater population, as much
business, and in our opinion, has greater claims to be made a port of
Entry than Indian Key.
The character of Jacob Housman, the proprietor of Indian Key,
well known upon this coast, affords no guaranty, that a privilege of a
port of Entry upon his island, will not be abused. In 1836 his share
of the salvage on the cargo of the ship Ajax, wrecked on the coast, was
forfeited by a decree of the Admiralty Court, on a charge made and
proved against him, of embezzling a part of the Cargo. In the same
case and at the same time, the salvage of a master of one of his wreck-
ing vessels was deemed forfeited by the Admiralty Court, for em-
bezzling and landing at Indian Key, a large quantity of valuable goods
from the same wreck; which goods are unaccounted for, to this day.
The records of our Admiralty Court shew these decisions unreversed,


## p. 251 (#265) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 251
and unappealed from. The records of the Court of Appeals at Talla-
hassee, show a decree made against him at the January term of 1838,
for $8600, for confederating and conspiring with the master of the
Schooner North Carolina, bound from Appalachicola to Charleston,
to dispose of a part of his cargo at Indian Key, under pretence of pay-
ing salvage; by which they defrauded the owners and underwriters,
and shared the spoils between them. Other, like instances might be
rehearsed, but as they have never been the subjects of Judicial in-
vestigation and become matters of record we will omit them. The
character of M* Housman as exhibited on this coast for a series of
years, render it certain, that the public revenues, and public con-
venience will not be benefitted by establishing a port of Entry on his
island. These facts are not stated from any hostile feeling towards
Mr. Housman, but that Congress may be in possession of them, as
necessary to be known, when the wishes of one man are sought to be
gratified at the expense of the many.
Again, Indian Key by the legislation of our Territorial Council,
and on the application of M* Housman, has been for the last three
years, and still is, placed beyond the reach and protection of the ordi-
nary operation of law. By our law, grand and petit Juries necessary
to accuse and punish for offences, must come from the county where
the offences are committed. Dade County has been set off from Mon-
roe, and Indian Key is in the new county of Dade, which does not
possess men enough in its entire population to form a grand and petit
jury. M' Housman combines in himself, the legislative, judicial and
executive authority, as lord of his insular proprietory. -
When the Southern or Tropical portion of Florida shall have been
settled, a port of Entry may be required at New River, Cape Florida
or at Charlotte's harbor. But a port at Indian Key, from its Geo-
graphical position, and on account of continued shoals between it and
the main land which will admit the passage of small boats only, will
not benefit the inhabitants, that may hereafter settle upon the main.
One port of Entry is sufficient for the Islands; and to establish another
among them on the possibility, that it may at some future period
accommodate the inhabitants upon the main would be to forestall
and embarrass the future action of Congress, and to act in advance of
the developments and wants of the country.
The commerce of these Islands as before stated is confined princi-
pally to wrecking. The salvors claim salvage upon vessels and Cargoes
thus saved, and it is adjuged and decreed to them by the Admiralty
court at Key West. This Court by a law of Congress is declared to
be always open; and the judge is directed to reside at Key West.
Thus the rights and claims of all persons, interested in the property,
are submitted to the action of an able and impartial tribunal; with the

right of an appeal to a higher Court. No such court exists at Indian
Key. Allow the entry and landing of wrecked goods at that place,
where there is neither a court, nor law to restrain the cupidity of the
proprietor; and the undersigned submit to Congress, what security
salvors, owners, or uderwriters can have, for their respective rights.
True, the Legislature of Florida have ordered a superior Court to be
held at Indian Key once in a year. But this will afford no adequate
protection; And Congress will find that the expense of another Ad-
miralty Court, must be added to that of the Revenue officers; all of
which are useless; and are prayed for, to advance the interests of one
individual and his paid agents.
The undersigned have stated, that Indian Key, except one small lot
occupied by the Inspector of Customs, is owned by M Housman.
This fact, they are aware, has been differently stated by M Housman's
agents to Congress. Recently several pretended deeds of conveyance
of lots upon that Island, have been made, and a map drawn, showing
several owners of lots &" to be laid before the committee. The most
of these deeds are revocable at the will of the grantor after two years,
by the deeds themselves; or by a defeasance contained in some other
instrument. Nearly all of them contain conditions, limitations &"
so that the land shall revert to the grantor, after the port of Entry is
obtained; as the undersigned are informed and believe. The names of
several persons are placed upon the map, as owners of lots, without
their knowledge or consent. These are artifices intended to be prac-
tised upon the Committee and Congress. The undersigned affirm
that there is but one bona fide proprietor of Indian Key, with the single
exception above named; and, that the proprietor refuses to sell, or
rent any portion of the island, that will favor any competition with
him in his business as a merchant, and the owner and manager of
wrecking vessels.
The mass of the inhabitants upon the Southern coast of Florida are
opposed to Indian Key being made a port of Entry—
The wreckers are opposed to it, because they will be required in
every case, where the master of the wrecked vessel so directs, to carry
the goods they save, to Indian Key after it shall have been made a
port of Entry; there to be stored, sold, and the salvage settled, at the
will of M* Housman, without competition at sales; and without the
restraints of the law. Many others are opposed to it, from principle
alone; as being unnecessary in itself; as benefitting one man only; and
at the same time injuring every other interest on the coast.
The undersigned know that petitions with numerous signatures
have been sent to Congress, praying for a port Entry at Indian Key.
It is believed that there are more signatures to these petitions than
there are men, in all South Florida. And it is known to the under-

signed, that these signatures are, principally, of men who never in-
habited the coast. In one instance it is known, that men, constituting
a large expedition against the Indians, under the command of Lieut.
Powel, of the U.S. Navy, signed one of these petitions at Indian Key,
several times over, with different signatures, for a glass of grog each
time.
The undersigned deem it not only proper, but their duty, to call the
attention of Congress to these facts and reasons, set forth against
granting the petition of M" Housman and others. They can obtain
the signatures of nearly the entire population of these islands, remon-
strating against making Indian Key a port of Entry; but they deem
the signatures of a few individuals, as vouchers for the facts stated,
as more satisfactory to the committee and to Congress. All of which
is respectfully submitted in the nature of a remonstrance against
constituting Indian Key a port of Entry—

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY STOCKHOLDERS IN
WACISSA AND AUSILLA NAVIGATION COMPANY
[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:C]
[Referred March 1, 1836]
To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America, in Congress Assembled, the Memorial of the Stockholders in
the “Wacissa and Ausilla Navigation Company” in Florida, respect-
fully represents.
That your Memorialists have been incorporated by an Act of the
Legislative Council of Florida for the purpose of rendering the Wacissa
river navigable from its source, to its junction with the Ausilla; * and
thence to the Gulph of Mexico—and also to connect the navigation
with the harbor of St Marks, if upon careful examination, such a work
is deemed practicable, and adviseable. That the proposed improve-
ments will be of great importance to the inhabitants of the Counties
* Cf. post, p. 551.

of Jefferson and Madison in said Territory; who are now compelled to
transport their produce to Market, an average distance of forty miles
over roads of the worst description, and little susceptible of improve-
ment. Your Memorialists have engaged in this work with little ex-
pectation that as Stockholders they will receive much if any profit
upon the money to be expended; but chiefly because this navigation
will benefit them, as well as the other planters in the Country. Your
Memorialists are all planters Citizens of Jefferson County.—Your
Memorialists pray leave to state, that the source, and the whole course
of the Wacissa river, until its junction with the Ausilla, is a continued
swamp of some miles in width, grown up with Bay, Cypress, & other
productions of a Wet soil; forming a thick “jungle”; and your Memori-
alists doubt whether half a dozen white men have ever yet found their
way through this swamp, which is to be made navigable. A map
of the Country, prepared in the Office of the Surveyor General of the
Territory, is herewith presented; which shews that all of Township
four, in Range two South East—and all of Township four in Range
three (except six sections)—And one half of Township three, and one
third of Township two, in Range three—and six Sections in Township
three in Range four, and the greater part of Township two in same
Range, Consist of swamp, & “impracticable to survey.” And from
personal knowledge of some of your Memorialists, they state that the
six sections surveyed in Township 4 Range 3, are too wet for cultiva-
tion, without a great expence of previous draining.
Congress has heretofore made liberal grants of money, and of land,
in aid of similar improvements in the Territories of the United States;
and your memorialists indulge the hope that the work which they
have undertaken, will not receive less favor. They therefore pray
that Congress will grant to the Company, twelve Sections of land,
with the right to locate the same in parcels of a quarter Section each,
upon any of the lands in the Territory of Florida, belonging to the
United States, and not reserved for public purposes.
It is probable that the completion of the work undertaken by your
Memorialists, will reclaim portions of the present “impracticable”
swamp; and give value to land, which is now, not only, worthless, but
noxious. And if the above prayer of your memorialists shall not be
deemed reasonable, they trust that Congress will grant to them the
lands described in this Memorial; & which are to receive the benefit
of their work.
The Map will shew that very little of the land in this district of
Country is considered worth the Minimum price of the Government;

[NA:WD, SW Lets. Recd., W166:LS]
WASHINGTON March 12, 1836.
SIR, The indifference which has been manifested in Congress to the
appeal which has been made in behalf of the distressed inhabitants of
East Florida, who have suffered by Indian depredations, in the deso-
lating war now going on, requires that I, as their representative, should
lose no opportunity of obtaining for them a just indemnification for
the injuries which they have sustained, from causes over which they
had no controul, and of the existence of which they were entirely
ignorant.
The pretext for receiving with coldness and indifference an applica-
tion founded on justice & humanity, is, that the Government is not
responsible for acts done in open war. I deny that this insurrection
of ruthless barbarians is to be put upon a footing with nations whose
conflicts are preceded by declarations of hostility, to whom the inter-
national code can be made to apply. They have not been treated either
in the theory or practice of this government, as independent foreign
* In transmitting Eaton's letter to C. C. Cambreleng, chairman of the House
Committee on Ways and Means, Mar. 14, 1836, the Secretary of the Treasury
recommended that an appropriation be made (NA, TD, ST Lets. and Repts.
to Cong., Bk. 8).
* By the act approved May 9, 1836 (5 STAT. 22), Congress appropriated for the
Legislative Council the amount of $9,406 and for arrearages the sum of $908.60.

nations, but as dependent domestic Communities, in unequal alliance
with the U. States.
The Circumstances attending these transactions will shew, that
with the causes out of which, this wide spread desolation has been
created, were not in any manner connected with the people of Florida.
They grew out of the Compact on the part of this Government, with
which the people of Florida were not acquainted, and relying with
implicit confidence that the Government itself would execute its own
engagements, and protect the frontiers against those collisions which
might arise in their fulfilment, they were not forearmed, because not
forewarned, of the approaching danger. It is useless to dwell upon
this painful subject, —It is enough to know that three entire Counties
have been overrun & destroyed, and their inhabitants reduced to
penury and ruin. If these ruffian barbarians are to be treated as
civilized nations; that this refined code may be applied to the exclusion
of these claims, we have a right right to apply another principle of
that code, by demanding of a Conquered enemy, as one of the terms
upon which pacification is granted, that their property and a portion
of their territory shall be surrendered to make compensation for the
outrages committed.
I respectfully propose to you in the first place, to apply to Congress
for a complete indemnification, for the losses of these unhappy
sufferers, or to instruct Maj. Gen Scott not to grant pacification, until
the whole property of the Nation be surrendered as a fund to pay these
claims, as far as it will go, and that they be required to surrender a
portion of their lands west of the Mississippi to make up the deficiency.
If, as it is represented, these Indians consider, that they have been
unjustly deprived of 5.000.000 of acres of land in East Florida, and
the inhabitants have suffered in Consequence of it, they are entitled to
an indemnity, to the extent of the Value of the land, which will more
than cover their losses.

THE HON SEC. OF THE TREASURY
SIR. The Barque Euphrates, of Bucksport, Maine, of which I am
at present master, has been loaded and ready to sail for Liverpool
since Friday last, a period of four days; but owing to the gross negli-
gence of the officers of the Custom in this District, I have not been
able until today to effect a clearance of the vessel. It is extremely
difficult to load a ship with Cotton in this place, as we are compelled
to lay seven miles below and lighter the cotton down; this of itself
causes a delay attended with much expense, and in addition to this,
the Indian troubles have operated to retard my progress: but having
succeeded, after an unusual and vexatious delay, in getting ready
for sea, I took several journeys from my ship to Magnolia, a distance
of fourteen miles, in order to clear out, but the Collector was not
there and the deputy Collector instead of being at his post had taken
a journey thirty or forty miles into the interior. The Collector lives
eighteen miles above Magnolia, which is the port of entry, and had
likewise gone to Apalachicola.
It is from no motive of personal pique against the revenue officers
in this quarter that I lay my complaints before your department—
their punishment would gratify no spirit of revenge, and certainly
would not indemnify me for the delay—I feel bound to state this
explicitly and further to acknowledge that I have received from Judge
Crane, the Surveyor at this place, every attention which a prompt and
gentlemanly officer could bestow; he, however, had unfortunately no
power to clear vessels bound for foreign ports. This is my case—
with a vessel of 247 tons burthen, and nearly 800 bales of cotton on
board, with a crew upon high wages, and at a season of the year when
expedition is peculiarly desirable, I am, by the palpable negligence
of a salary officer detained here four days! Is there no remedy for me?
Can an officer of your department compel a vessel to wait upon his
private convenience, when the Charterer himself often pays for
demurrage after having used his best endeavors towards despatch?
Seventy five dollar per diem would not more than compensate me
for the loss sustained by this detention, and I feel that I should be
remiss in my duty as a faithful agent of the owners not to state these
circumstances.
May I request your early attention to this subject, and that you
will reply to my enquiries by letter addressed to Edward D. Peters Esq

HON. JOSEPH M. WHITE. House of Representatives.
SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 12th instant,”
and have submitted it to the President, who has instructed me to com-
municate to you, this answer.
In carrying out the policy which has been adopted, not less for the
sake of the Indians, than for that of the Government and Citizens of
the United States, it was found necessary to remove the Seminole
Indians from Florida to the Country West of the Mississippi river.
Their condition was the subject of investigation in both Houses of
Congress; and documents received from yourself and other persons,
demonstrated the necessity of their removal. Under these circum-
stances, a council was directed to be held with them; which was done,
and a treaty concluded by Colonel Gadsden, the Commissioner, for
the cession of their claims in Florida, and for their transfer to the
Country West of the Mississippi.” This treaty was not negotiated

with a view to the benefit of the Government of the United States
only, but in pursuance of a general system of policy, and with a view
to ensure the welfare of the Indians, and at the same time to promote
the interests of the Territory. This explanation of the motives which
led to the treaty, is given, to correct the misapprehension, which you
seem to entertain, that an arrangement was made, by the General
Government, for the cession of land in Florida, independently of the
interests of the Territory.
This Department has never had the slightest reason to believe that
the Indians were unjustly deprived of their possessions in Florida.
The reasons given by themselves, and contained in a communication
made to Congress,” for not emigrating, are certainly very frivolous,
and obviously shew, that they were aware of the nature of their en-
gagements. The high character of Colonel Gadsden, and the pub-
licity of the transactions of the council at Payne's landing, the ap-
pointment of a deputation, in conformity with the treaty, to visit and
examine the Country West," the convention subsequently entered
into by that deputation," which rendered the conditional arrange-
ments, entered into at Payne's landing, absolute; and the agreements
made, by all the influential Seminole Chiefs, with General Clinch,
General Thompson, and Lieutenant Harris, in April 1835,” in which
they renewed their pledges to remove, all shew, they fully understood
the obligations they had contracted, and that there is no foundation
for the representation that they had been unjustly deprived of their
lands in Florida.
You propose that application should be made to Congress for com-
plete indemnification for the losses of the sufferers. If, as I presume,
you mean, that such an application should be made by the President,
I am instructed to say, the President does not think, such a measure
should originate with him. It is a subject for legislative consid-
eration.
You farther propose, as another alternative, that “General Scott be
directed not to grant pacification to the Indians, until the property of
the nation be surrendered to pay these claims, as far as it will go, and
that they be required to surrender a portion of the lands West of the
Mississippi.”
The hostile operations in Florida have been disastrous, and have
excited much commiseration through the whole Country, and the con-
duct of the Indians has been without any justification. But such
scenes, in a greater or less degree, have attended every Indian War,

nor do I see any principle, peculiarly applicable to Florida, which
would require compensation to be provided to her citizens, and would
not, at the same time, extend to other districts of country ravaged in
a similar manner. As to property, they have none, except the annui-
ties payable to them, and their possessions West of the Mississippi.
An act of Congress in 1796,” first established the principle, that, if any
Indians, in amity with the United States, shall cross the boundary
line, and commit depredations upon our citizens, the amount of the
injury, under the circumstances stated in the act, should be ascer-
tained, and an eventual indemnification guarantied by the United
States. It was farther provided, that the amount, paid on this
account, should be deducted from any annuity due to the proper tribe.
The principle was embodied in the intercourse act of 1802,” and again
in that of 1834." But it applies only, as you perceive, to Indians in
a state of amity, and if it is to be extended to those tribes, committing
open hostilities, that measure must be taken by Congress. It is to
be observed, that only a portion of the Seminole Indians have been
in a state of hostility. Many of them have not only remained at
peace, but have aided our troops in their operations. Whether, under
these circumstances, the annuity should continue to be paid, is a
question not yet determined.
As to the cession, by the Seminoles, of the district of Country pro-
vided for their residence West of the Mississippi, that measure cannot
be adopted. They must exist somewhere, and if that land is taken
from them, they have no place to remove to, and besides, it is in the
Country set apart for the permanent residence of the Indians, and it
is an established feature in the policy of removal, that no right of soil
shall be acquired by the United States, or by White persons in that
region, but that the Western boundary of Arkansas and Missouri, so
far North as the Indian locations extend, shall separate their settle-
ments from ours. If once a cession is obtained, and a white settlement
formed in the midst of that district of Country, we may abandon all
hopes of the permanent establishment of the Indians.
Such propositions as you make, have never yet been acted upon by
the Executive. And without entering into any consideration of the
question, as to how far the general law of Nations ought to regulate
our intercourse with the Indians during a state of hostilities, or the
consequences flowing therefrom, and applicable to any pacification
that may be granted I am instructed by the President to say, that he

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF
ST. AUGUSTINE 67
[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:DS"]
[March 1836]
To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled.
The Petition of the undersigned Inhabitants of the City of S'
Augustine in East Florida Respectfully sheweth;
That at the commencement of the present Seminole War, when
many of our Citizens had been called away on public duty—and
those who remained were but scantily supplied with arms and am-
munition, the defenceless condition of S‘Augustine became the sub-
ject of remark abroad; and of painful consideration at home. The
lines on the north of the City—relied upon under the Spanish Domin-
ion, as one of the important defences of the place having fallen into
decay and presenting no means of resistance to an invading enemy—
it occurred to many of your petitioners that the time had arrived
when they should be repaired. That your petitioners were the more
impressed with this belief, is, because the Savages had ravaged a
large portion of the surrounding country and were in the immediate
neighborhood of S*Augustine, manifesting as they had done a daring
ferocity—new even in the Indian character—it was within the limits
of possible contingencies, that, influenced by revenge, cupidity and
the advice of their black counsellors, they might endeavor to find
their way into the City itself; but, whatever might be the event, it
seemed to your petitioners both necessary and proper to adopt every
means within their reach, for defence. Accordingly a subscription
was circulated and individual contributors were found, ready for the
purpose of making the northern boundary of S*Augustine more secure
against attack. The work went forward, the lines were repaired;
an Avenue was cut out and levelled 30 feet in width, and about 2,500
feet in length; the Rempart was put in good condition, and a Parapet

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY THE TRUSTEES OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA
[NA:SF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.: DS"]
TALLAHASSEE, April 2° 1836.
The undersigned, the Trustees of the University of Florida, beg
leave to present to the Congress of the United States the following
petition, showing:
That they have had their attention for some time past drawn to
the subject of education in the Territory of Florida, and to the wants
of its inhabitants in connection with education. The result of their
consideration of the circumstances of the Territory and its necessities
in connection with education has presented to them the following
particulars:
First. Owing to the circumstance of the families being scattered
over a large tract of country, the system of common schools, for the
present, is not a practicable one as the children would necessarily have
to travel too far to reach the location of their school-houses. This
results in part from the fact that the country is as yet but thinly
settled, and between the richer tracts of land which are occupied, and
which are in themselves limited in extent, there are extensive and sterile
piney-woods intervening, which will always render the population a
scattered one.
Again. It is believed to be a generally conceded truth, that all
popular governments depend on the virtue and intelligence of the
people, and that virtue and intelligence can be expected only as the
result of a correct and efficient system of education. With this fact
in view, the undersigned believe it to be greatly important to our
people, that the best system of which the circumstances of the Terri-
tory will admit should be introduced at once, before our habits and
institutions become too well established to be easily changed. And
they are persuaded that the best, if not the only practicable system of
education in the Territory is the establishment of a Seminary of learn-
ing in some favourable position of the Same, which shall induce the
different families of the Territory to send to it their sons.
The undersigned would further represent, that the present state of
the Territory is such, that but little reliance can be had upon individual
contributions in giving successful and permanent establishment to a
" Printed also in S. Doc. 346, 24 Cong., 1 sess.

general Seminary of learning in the Territory. The undersigned turn
therefore to Congress, whose prerogative it is to legislate for the welfare
of the Territories, and who have already with much liberality con-
sulted their wants. In so doing, the undersigned at once find that
Congress has already, with what is deemed to have been commendable
fore thought, made provision for the establishment of a University in
the Territory by reserving two townships of land, one in East and one
in West Florida, which shall be devoted to such Seminary of learning
when the Territory shall become a State.” But, as that period may
yet be some time in the future—and as the wants of the Territory in
connection with education are as great now as they then will be—and
probably, considering her dependence, those wants at the present
moment are still greater therefore, your petitioners desire that these
lands may at once be rendered available for the benefit of the Uni-
versity of Florida of which the undersigned are the Trustees. They
believe that Congress, by so doing, will by its act most successfully
secure the designed end of the providing statute already alluded to,
which was to promote education in the Territory, and thus, at once,
give to the Territory the needed benefit of the most practicable system
of education of which the present circumstances of the people will
admit.
All which is respectfully submitted and asked, and your petitioners
will ever pray, &c.

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
Your memorialists, settlers upon the lands in the district of country
in the Territory of Florida commonly known as Forbes’ Purchase,
most humbly and respectfully represent unto your honourable Bodies.
That attracted as well by the benefits held out by the munificence of
the government in the right of preemption to settlers upon the publick
lands as by the advantages of soil and climate your memorialists were
amongst the earliest settlers of Florida after the change of Flags;
and believing the claim of Forbes & co, would not be recognised by
the government as valid after its rejection by the board of commission-
ers appointed to settle land claims under the Spanish treaty, and the
decision of the Superiour Court of the Middle District of Florida
adverse to their claim, Your memorialists have gone on to improve
their settlements, encountering all the dangers, privations and ex-
penses incident to the first settlement of all new countries under the
confident expectation that when these lands should be brought into
market by the government, their right of preemption would assure
to them at the minimum price the certainty of a home for their
wives and their children, and a prospect of remuneration for their
labour and expenditures in making plantations in the wilderness.
But the decision of the Supreme court of the United States confirming
the grant of those lands to the Claimants has destroyed these reliances.

to, has procured the passage of an Act of Congress not only directing
the sessions of the Superior Court to be held in Apalachicola; but
actually detaching the County of Franklin from the western, and
attaching it to Middle judicial District.”—While your memorialists
wish it distinctly understood, that to the Judge of the Middle District
they have no objection—that he is a gentleman meriting their respect,
esteem, and confidence, they would represent that the county of
Franklin is situated on the West side of the Apalachicola river, and
has ever formed a part of the Western District, that they have entire
confidence in the qualifications, and integrity of the Judge of the
Western District, and have no desire to be transfered to another
jurisdiction—Your memorialists considering the questions purely
local, in its character, in the decission of which, the wishes, and con-
venience of the people of the county ought alone to be considered—
respectfully protest against the Transfer of the County of Franklin
from the western; to the Middle District, and request their Delegate

JUDGE WEBB TO DELEGATE WHITE
[NA:SF, 24 Cong., 1 sess.:ALS]
WASHINGTON, 12. April 1836–
HON, J. M. WHITE,
SIR, In complyance with your request, that I should express my
opinion as to the propriety of abrogating the Act of the Legislature
of Florida dividing the County of Monroe, & establishing a Court at
Indian Key, I have to observe, that I can perceive no injuries which
will necessarily result from the Act in question, except such as may
grow out of the impossibility of obtaining Jurors for the trial of im-
portant causes in the Courts of either County—
Previous to the division, there were not more than One hundred
persons residing within the limits of Monroe County, who, by the
laws of the Territory, were qualified to serve as jurors; & the conse-
quence was, that even then, a difficulty was often experienced in
procuring jurors for the trial of important causes.—
Under the present arrangement, the Statutes intended for the
prevention of crime, will be wholly inoperative in that section of the
Country, & had as well be stricken from the Statute book—By the
Territorial law, prisoners, (no matter how aggravated their offences)
are discharged from their crimes, if not tried at the third term after

arrest; and as they will always be able to prevent a trial by availing
themselves of their right of Challenge, it is not presuming much, to
suppose, that they will in this way avoid punishment.—
It is certainly true, that the people labor under some inconvenience
in getting to the Courts, & it would be gratifying to me, could they
be relieved from that diff inconvenience without involving conse-
quences, which would be much more injurious to them—At present
however, I know but one way in which it can be done; & that is, by
increasing their Compensation for travel & attendance on the Courts

I do not see that I can prescribe any more certain principles to carry
into effect the object of Congress. Some discretion must necessarily
be exercised by the issuing Officers, as, in a matter like this, it is diffi-
cult to prescribe rules which shall embrace all cases.
You observe, that the resolution, referred to, was adopted in a
spirit of liberality and generosity by Congress, and to provide sub-
sistence for all descriptions of persons, who were driven from their
homes, and, in consequence of the destruction of their property, by
the Indians, left without a supply of provisions. There are two
requisites, which, by this resolution, must be united in a person,
before he can receive provision from the public stores.
He must have been driven from his home, by Indian depredations
in Florida. And
He must be an unfortunate sufferer, unable to provide for himself.
The first requisite is susceptible of direct proof, and, therefore,
needs no consideration.
The second, presents a more difficult question. I find, in adverting
to the progress of this Resolution through the House, that, when first
submitted, it did not contain any clause respecting the inability of the
sufferers. It embraced all who had been driven from their homes by
Indian depredations. An amendment was introduced and adopted,
which declared, that they should also be unable to provide for them-
selves, and in this form, the Resolution was passed.
Who then, are unable to provide for themselves? This question is
met, as clearly as it can be, by the regulations. Nor does the Presi-
dent, to whom this matter has been submitted, see any reason to
change his original views. From the particular state of things in
Florida, there may be such a scarcity of provisions, as to render it
difficult for any body, without great sacrifices, to procure them.
Where this is the case, provisions ought to be issued, as it may be
fairly construed to be such an inability, as is intended to be met by
the Resolution. If, however, provisions are sufficiently abundant, and
so reasonable in price, as to be within the reach of ordinary means,
I do not think that a person, able by labor, to support himself, or
possessed of such means, either in cash, in slaves, in land, or in other
species of property, as will procure the provisions, or as will insure to
him the necessary credit, by which provisions can be obtained, can
be said to be unable to provide for himself. The Resolution does not,
as has been supposed, refer to the cutting off of the ordinary resources
or income of a person; but it makes his right to this aid to depend
upon his actual inability to provide for himself.

The commissary General will instruct the Officers of his Depart-
ment, on this subject, in conformity with these views. You will see
that something must be left to their discretion, and that the propriety
of issuing provisions to persons possessed of property, must depend
very much upon the state of the Country. If I am wrong in this con-
struction, a supplementary Resolution, declaring more clearly the
views of Congress, will, at once. afford the proper remedy.”

which it will appear, that while our Troops are marching and counter
marching in the enemy's country, we are invaded by the same enemy.
Only a few days since a body of 400 well appointed and equiped
mounted men from Georgia, furnished on the requisition of Gen"Scott,"
after marching to the Depot on Black Creek in Florida, without being
sent on any service whatever (as I am informed) were disbanded and
ordered home.
The Florida Volunteers a well organized and efficient Batalion of
300 men, was disbanded one month before their term of service ex-
pired, and the day after their arrival here I rec" an express informing
me that the Indians had reappeared in considerable numbers, and
were commiting depredations on our frontier settlements. It is evi-
dent that the enemy instead of retreating to the South before the
several divisons of Gen" Scotts Army, merely evaded them and re-
mained in their rear, ready to attack the frontier so soon as it should
be left unprotected. Many of their warriors are already well mounted,
and from their success in capturing horses as well from the Army as
from our Citizens, they will be enabled in a short time to mount a
formidable band.
I have had no communication from Gen." Gains Scott since he
marched from Tampa Bay but there is no hope of his bringing the
war to a close with the forces now in the field. I understand he does
not intend making another Campaign until the fall. In the meantime
our frontier will be continually exposed to the Tomahawk and Scalping
Knife, and the safety of our people requires the adoption of the most
prompt and efficient measures for their protection. Mounted men
alone will be effective in the performance of this duty, and our Citizens
and their horses have both been so much harrassed with the war that
it will be a very difficult matter indeed to procure any considerable
number of either during the Summer. The line of frontier to be
defended will be near three hundred miles in extent, and will require
at least 500 horse men, to keep the enemy in check. I have ordered
out one hundred from the Counties of Alachua and Duval, other
companies shall be organized as soon as practicable, and held in readi-
ness to march at a moments warning.
The people of Alachua you will percieve from the enclosed letter
have been compelled to seek protection in the Forts. They will not
be able to return to their homes in safety during the Summer, and the
Government will be compelled to supply them with subsistence. In
this state of things I beg leave to recommend that the Women and

Children should be removed to some place of safety where they can be
more conveniently subsisted than at the little forts on the frontier.
When this is done the men will more willingly engage in the service.
In my last I mentioned that there were large claims against the Pay
and Quarter Masters Departments which remain unsatisfyed. None
of our Troops have been paid for their services, and many of our
Citizens have furnished supplies for which they have received no
compensation.

other parts of the frontiers which indicate a large body of Indians
dispersed in various quarters—
The Regular Troops who will remain in the Country are considered
inadiquate for its protection. The inhabitants below have fled to the
Forts again; and some are removing to places more remote from
danger; In fact unless you authorize the raising a Company of men
to protect our frontiers the country will in all probability be aban-

SIR, I hope you will not accept Gen Clinchs resignation" until I
arrive at Washington—He is the only man who has the Confidence
of the Militia of the Southern States, & his being driven from service
at this moment will be most disasterous to the whole frontier—
I should not be at all surprized if the Creeks in attempting a junction
with the Florida Indians desolate all Middle Florida and drive off all
the negroes—In the beginning of this affair I recommended to the
Secretary at War & Gen Scott to have St Marks & Appilachicola made
Depots of provissions & munitions of war—The Creeks will now be
attacked on the West & North by Alabama & Georgia, & forced down
on Florida—For the defence of that Country Troops must be sent to
St Marks and Appilachicola—You well know that you marched
through that Country in June without thinking of seeking “Summer
quarters” in refreshing sea breezes—There cannot be raised 500 men
between the Lower Creek line, & that of the Seminoles—The “three
wings of the army” having fled at one moment, without any Call for
new forces this whole frontier will be a schene of Blood—
I respectfully recommend that Clinch be ordered to middle Florida

RESOLUTIONS BY CITIZENS OF GADSDEN COUNTY
[LC:Tallahassee, The Floridian, May 21, 1836]
[May 14, 1836]
At a meeting of the Citizens of Gadsden County, convened at the
court house in Quincy, on the 14th of May, 1836, to take into con-
sideration the state of the country, and to adopt measures for the
safety of the same, against our savage enemies, the Creeks and Sem-
inole Indians, who have been, and are now committing depredations
upon the property, and destroying the lives of our citizens:
The Rev. Jesse Coe was called to the Chair, and R. H. M. Davidson
was appointed Secretary. The meeting was addressed by the Chair
man and Charles H. DuPont, Esqr. who explained the object for
which they had assembled, when, on motion of C. H. DuPont, Esqr.
it was resolved, that a Committee of seven, consisting of Charles
Munnerlyn, James Gibson, Joseph M'Bride Daniel L. Kenan, Isham
Johnson, Jason Gregory, Esquires and Dr. Thomas Munro, be ap-
pointed to report what measures, may be necessary to take for the
safety of our Country.
On motion of Colonel John C. Love, the Chairman was added to the
Committee.
The meeting then adjourned until half past 3 o'clock P. M.
The meeting convened pursuant to adjournment and the proceed-
ings of the morning being read, the following preamble and resolutions,
were offered by the Committee, and unanimously adopted.
“The Committee appointed in pursuance of the foregoing resolu-
tions, having taken into consideration the matters submitted to them,
and all the information they have been able to procure from the Creek
nation in Alabama and Columbus in the State of Georgia, beg leave
to submit the following resolutions:—
Resolved, That in the present emergency, it be recommended to the
people of this County, generally, both young and aged, to organize
themselves into Volunteer companies, and arm themselves properly,
and meet as frequently for the purpose of mustering, &c. as may be
requisite.
Resolved, That it be expedient to procure all the information that
can be obtained, relative to the hostile attitude and intentions of the
Creek Indians, and the probable effect that their measures may have
upon the people of this County, and that the Colonel of the 5th Regi-
ment be requested to procure the services of such a number of Volun-
teers as may be required to carry this resolution into effect.
Resolved, That whereas, there are some indications of a hostile
nature, among the Indians on the Appalachicola river, it be respect-

fully recommended to the Governor of the Territory to disarm those
Indians, and take such other steps as he may deem necessary to pre-
serve their neutrality.
Resolved, That his Excellency, the Governor, be requested to place
at the disposal of the commanding officer of the 5th Regiment, 200
stand of arms, with the necessary accoutrements, and ammunition to
be distributed among the citizens of this County, in the event, that
the present emergency may require it.
Resolved, That Charles H. DuPont, Esqr. Dr. T. Munro, and Dr.
M. Nichalson be appointed a Committee to memoralize the President
of the United States, most respectfully representing to him our exposed
and defenceless situation, between the Creek Indians on the one hand,
and the Seminoles on the other, requesting him to take such steps in
our behalf, as the present emergency evidently demands.
On motion of Dr. T. Munro, the Secretary of this meeting was
requested to forward a copy of these proceedings to the Governor of
the Territory, R. K. Call, to the Floridian, Florida Intelligencer and
the Evening Star, New York.
On motion of Colonel D. L. Kenan, the meeting adjourned sine die.”

I recollect to have conversed with him on this subject, and do not
think it was his intention to have remitted the fine of Mr S. But I
am not advised whether all the communications on this subject had

of the highly respectable Gentleman who have interested themselves in
behalf of Mr. Seuell, I do not feel prepared to remit the fine. The
pardoning power should only be exercised in cases of great hardship,
when no doubt exist that the cause of Justice would be subserved by
such interposition, and it should not be on slight grounds, that the
verdict of a Jury, who are always supposed to be entirely impartial
between the parties, and in such cases to be influenced only by a
desire to promote the public peace and morals should be set aside, from
all that has reached me on both sides of the subject, I can not regard
it as a case presenting such claims for relief, I am therefore con-

to me, that a number of individuals of Jackson County, Unauthorised
by Law, have arrested a negro man, the property of E. W. Payton,
and having constituted themselves a body for the trial of said Negro,
have proceeded to try and pass sentence of death on him and have
ordered his execution on the twentieth day of the present month,
Which proceeding are neither countenanced by Law nor sanctioned
by any necessity known to exist, and are pregnant if not promptly
arrested with incalculable evils to the community tending to the utter
subversion of the supremacy of the Laws, the peace and good order
of society and substituting in the place of the calm unimpassioned,
and unbiased Judgment of the regularly constituted authorities of
the Country, that of a self created tribunal, acting, as will ever be the
case under the influence of popular excitement too strong to be with-
stood, and which if unchecked and arrestained, must create a spirit
of recklessness subversive of all order and all Law.
Now therefore the people of said County, and particularly the
officers both civil and Military, and the commandant of the first
Brigade of the Florida Militia, are hereby commanded to use all
Lawful means to prevent the execution of said Negro, and to use the
Military force of said County if necessary for that purpose and for
the protection of said prisoner, while in Jail. And they are further en-
joined to deliver said Negro to the civil authorities of said County, to
be dealt with according to Law.

SIR. An express arrived at this place on the 6" instant bringing
information of such a manifestation of the hostile disposition of the
seminole Indians, as rendered in my opinion the employment of a
part of the Military force of the Country necessary for the protection
of the inhabitants residing near the Indian limits, through this source
I learn that a principal chief of the Nation,” who had made known his
determination of delivering up his property to the Indian agent
employed by Government to Superintend the removal of these Indians,
for the purpose of being sold preparatory to his removal was put to
death by his people, and another chief averse to the emigration chosen
in his stead, the habitation of the Indians in the vicinity of the United
States, troops were immediately abandoned, and in two or three nighs
afterwards, an attack was made by a party of Indians on a house of
a white settler who though repeatedly fired on suceeded in escaping
with his family, leaving his house to be pillaged, and destroyed by fire,
the apprehension of the frontiers, is represented as being so great, that
the people have deserted their homes, and collected together for mutual
defence, the regular troops stationed in the nation consisting entirely
of Infantry, and very limited in number, I regard as incompetent to
protect so extinsive a line of Country, Their movemants must neces-
sarily be Slow. and the Indians recede in the morasses & swamps, may
in small bodies penetrate into the settlements, lay waste the Country,
and retreat to their hiding places, without ever being brought into
action, under these circumstances, I have ordered a troop of three
hundred mounted Riflemen to be immediately embodied and engaged
in the protection of the exposed County, They are instructed not

to enter the Indian limits, unless further hostilities are perpetrated
on the white inhabitants, or in the event of the invasion of the Indian
Country, by the U.S. troops, then their services shall be required by
the commanding officer, I have received no communication from
the U. S. agent stationd in the nation, or from Genl. Clinch the Officer
commanding the troops on this subject But the numerous applica-
tions made to me by the most respectable sources in that section of
Country, have satisfied me, of the necessity of these measures,—From
all the information I received, in relation to the disposition of the
Seminole Indians to comply with the treaty provided for their emi-
gration, I have no doubt that nothing short of compulsion will induce
them to do so. If this cause should be determined on, and the requisite
force for this purpose, cannot be conveniently spared from other
points, a sufficient number of Volunteers, can be raised in this Terri-
tory for that service

SIR. An express has Just reached this place bringing information
worthy of Credit, of such acts of violence, and outrage committed
by the seminole Indians as to have scarcely a hope that anything
short of the display of an efficient military force will be adequate to
the protection of that portion of our fellow Citizens more immediately
exposed to their inroads. The population of that section of Country
is represented as insufficient to curb or punish the Indian aggressors,
and an appeal has been made to the people of Middle Florida, for
assistance, This assistance I have deemed it my duty to grant, and
have to request that immediately on the receipt of this order that
you will cause to be detailed from your Brigade one hundred mounted
Rifle men to be engaged in the Protection of the exposed Frontier In
the discharge of this duty, you will not pass the Indian Boundary

SIR. The facilities possessed by the Seminole Indians, who at this

from pursuit and transporting themselves from point to point on our

for more effectual operation against them. I have therefore the
honor to request that if in your power you will furnish such Naval
aid as may be competent for this purpose. The character of force
to be employed I have placed at the discretion of Lieu" Goldsborough
whose knowledge of the coast Rivers &c, in which it is proposed to

SIR—Since my letter of the 8” Instant,” Nothing of particular

informed by an individual from the frontier that a scout of eighteen
men engaged in Scouring the Country, about thirty miles from the
Indian reserve, were attacked by a superior force and effected their
retreat to port with the loss of one man Kiled and one wounded Be-
lieving that the frontier could only be successfully protected by carry-
ing the War into the enemies Country, I directed Brigadier General
R. K. Call to accept the services of such volunteers, as might tender
them to the number of five hundred men, that a force adequate to
this purpose might be in readiness if required by the US Officer, in
command at Fort King, This number of Florida Volunteers under
the command of General Richard K. Call, are by this time at their
Station ready for duty. A large party of Indians are reported to
have been seen between the Suwannee, and St. Marks Rivers, with

with great facility, Their proximity to the most denseley populated,
and central portion of the Territory, and the ease, and secrecy with
which they may approach into the midst of the settlements by ascend-

their removal or expulsion from this section of Country. Although
I have not heard of any act of hostility being committed by them,
As this cannot be done alone by a land force as they would be able
readily to defeat pursuit, by resorting to their boats and as the shallow-

the West India squadron and of the Navy yard at Pensacola for a
detachments of boats to cruise along the coast and up the rivers &c,
to intercept their retreat”—I will in the meantime however cause them
to be communicated with through an Interpreter and if found to be

TO THE HONOURABLE LEWIS CASS Secretary at War
SIR On the evening of yesterday an express arrived from the head
Quarters of Brigadier General R. K. Call, on the frontier of the
Seminole Indians with dispaches as late as the 22" Instant.” He
arrived at Micanopy (now called Fort Defiance) on the 20" with the
volunteers from Middle Florida, under his command and had been
joined by the East Florida, volunteers, making his command about
five hundred men The day before his arrival at Fort Defiance, the
Guard of the Baggage Waggon of Col. Warren's of the East Florida
volunteers, was attacked and defeated by a party of Indians and the
Baggage. amunition & stores captured, the loss sustained was two
or three men killd and six wounded, the day succeeding this affair,
General Call pursued the same line of march and recovered all the
Baggage &c. lost with the exception of four kegs of powder. He fell
in with a small Body of Indians on the 20" Instant, within a mile of
Fort Defiance four of whom were killed in a skirmish that ensued,
General Call represents the effective force now in service as sufficient
to subdue any enemy that may be embodied But insufficient for
the conquest of the County. as Indians disperse themselves in small
bodies, of from ten to fifty in number, and therefore require a larger
number of Troops to act against them in detachments, than if met
in larger Bodies. He has made a requisition on the Territory for
two hundred and fifty mounted men, in addition to his present com-
mand. and I have issued orders for their immediate detailment. The
Frontier is described as being in the most exposed condition and en-
tirely laid waste by the enemy, and deserted by our people for thirty
miles along the Indian Limits, from the Suwannee to the S" Johns, the
enemy are determined on resistance to the last extremity. But I do
not doubt that the energetic measures taken will in a few weeks cause
their compliance with the treaty—

Dr SIR By the enclosed dispatch from Genl. Call,” you will perceive

A few regulars equal to garrison duty & 150 Militia, are all the force
by Genl. Calls report, which is now in the field. Militia are few &
widely scattered here & as for arms there are none. I send tomorrow
an express to Augusta as in my letter I advised you I should do, to
procure arms, if successful an expedition may be gotten up again by
the last of this month. Again let me repeat. that a large & improv-
ing force, will be necessary, as being the most economical to put down
these Indians. a force barely adequate, act, with little confidence in
themselves & are all the time going to & coming back from the war.
Such you will see was the case with Gen'Call's volunteers, their term
had expired. & they would come home, with an enemy just in view
of them, the Country is full of morasses & Swamps, and such a force
should be ordered, that occassional detachments may be sent out in
different directions to intercept & cut up the enemy, and parties be
left to guard deports that necessarily may be required to be found
in the rear of the advance—Two or three Steam Boats to scour the
coast & transport Troops, & to furnish supplies will also be necessary,

the same;” sent, in conformity with the Commissioners letter of 21*

HON JO” M WHITE Tallahassee Florida
SIR, I have received your letter of the 12" instant," dated at
Augusta, and in answer, beg leave to inform you that, General Scott
has been directed to place the regular troops in such positions as will
best afford protection to the settlements in Florida. He has also
been instructed not to remove any of these troops from the Territory.
He has full power to call for such Militia force both mounted and
Infantry, as may be necessary to subdue the Indians and to restrain
them from committing depredations. Besides this, Governor Call
has been informed that if, at any time the frontier is not properly
defended, the Department will sanction the employment of any force
he may find it necessary to call out for that purpose, before General
Scott can take the proper measures. The Volunteer bill, has not yet
passed. The moment it becomes a law," Governor Call will be
authorized to raise One thousand men under it, such portion to be
mounted as he may think proper, and to employ as many of them as
may be necessary for the subjugation of the Seminoles. No law has
been passed for increasing the Dragoons and consequently, I cannot
adopt your suggestions on that subject. As to the Appropriation,
every thing shall be asked for, by this Department, which shall seem

necessary to restrain the Indians and protect the inhabitants. From
the commencement of these difficulties, I know of no measure which
seems to be proper, which has not been adopted, for suppressing these
Indians. And you may rely upon it, that the measures for future
defence, shall be upon a scale proportioned to the exigency.
Positive instructions have been given for the liquidation and pay-

of the Department to pay.”

to a great number of Lotts, on which the purchasers have made valu-

they now claim of us this Land and ask the possession of it—We as

without recompense, by the operation of our countrys Laws—Ask
your advice in what manner we shall proceed–Shall we give them the
possession without a suit? or shall we be obliged to contest it at
Law—the very operation of this Law thus far—has brought us from
a state of affluence, as we was when we first emigrated to this Terri-
tory, in the year 1825—to a now state of insolvency—which renders
us totally unable to pay the necessary costs to carry this point through
the proper courts of our country—Such is our anxiety to know our
situation, we shall be impatient for your answer—We did not know
of this claim including this Land at the time of our purchase, nor
could it have been known to the Surveyor General or he would not
of course have had it surveyed—We have until this singular or unex-
pected decree of the Court was known considered ourselves Safe under
the eleventh section of the missourie Law—but now it is said the
Court have pronounced, by their decree in the case, that section of
the Law unconstitutional. We presume it unnecessary to refer you
to the Statue Laws of the U.S.—which werpresume doubtless you are
familiar with—on which we have concluded ourselves safe under-

we would refer you for all the information on this subject and of our-
selves, you may desire—Permit us my dear Sir, to add that we are
extremely solicitious to know your opinion, and have your advice how
to proceed—that we may not in any manner compromise our claim
of the General Government for a just and full recompense, if this
property shall be taken from us—If we are intrusive in this applica-
tion to you for advice, you will pardon our presumption and attribute
it to our ignorance—We have conceived this a transaction in which
the Government might be involved, and under this impression, have
thought ourselves entitled to your advice in the Case *

DELEGATE WHITE TO THE EDITOR OF THE
PENSACOLA GAZETTE
[LC:Pensacola Gazette, May 14, 1836]
[No date, May 1836]
To the Editor of the Pensacola Gazette:
I have observed in some just and judicious remarks in your paper
of the 9th ult. in relation to the increasing prospects and population
of Black Water, that in parenthesis you give a word for the “ear of
Col. White.” This is done in so good humoured a manner, and is
so fair a hit, that I cannot enter into a grave defence to shew that
numbers of voters are not necessary to urge me to attend to the inter-
ests of the good people of Black Water. The spur or motion of the
whip is necessary even to spirited chargers, whose energies and mettle
are flagging under hard service, (or to borrow a phrase from the mili-
tary) public men, like soldiers, must keep an eye on the fugleman,
whose evolutions on the first Monday of May, may unhorse the
inattentive and negligent.
But to the point, as the lawyers say, I have had inserted in the Bill
for new Post Routes, one from Pensacola by Florida, Black Water,
Pittman’s Ferry, to Marianna," and thence, as now established, to
Tallahassee, and have had a further appropriation reported for com-
pleting that road.
The Post Route Bill is only passed for all the States and Territories
at one time, and generally once in two or three years.
This interval causes inconvenience sometimes to settlers, where,
new places grow up so rapidly as Black Water.
This was done before I heard that there was a voting population
of one hundred and fifty, (which I am glad to hear,) as heretofore
Black Water has furnished White men.
I am very respectfully, Your most ob't. servant,
JOS. M. WHITE.

the neighbourhood of Cape Sable, but twenty miles from Indian Key.
Their fires are Seen from that Island. Parties of straggling Indians
are frequently Seen between the Chain of Islands on this Coast and
the Main Land.” The Light House at Cape Florida is So much
exposed that the light keeper is about to abandon it. Two Indians
and a Spaniard have been taken prisoners at Indian Key.
The undersigned would not presume to judge of the exigencies of
the Naval Service, but would respectfully Suggest the propriety of
a permanent establishment of a Cutter on this Coast, if the Same can
be done consistently with the interests of other Naval operations."

HIS EXCELLENCY R. K. CALL Governor of Florida Tallahassee.
SIR, I addressed you a short letter on saturday,” informing you
that General Clinch's resignation had been accepted,” and renewing
the authority for you to take command of the regular troops and
militia serving in Florida. It is the expectation of the President, that
you will employ them in the best manner in the subjugation of the
Indians, and the protection of the country. The proper operations
must be committed to your own discretion. The President is dis-
posed to think well of the plan suggested by you, but there are also
many circumstances, which must have weight in such a matter, that
the proper measures can only be determined upon where they are to
be carried into effect. Among these, not the least important, is the
climate. It is obvious that a very great risk of human life from its
insalubrity, ought not to be, unless the state of the Country absolutely
requires such an exposure. Opinions upon the subject of carring on
a campaign during the summer have been variant. You must exer-
cise a sound discretion upon the whole matter.
I enclose a copy of a letter this day addressed to General Scott,” by
which you will see that orders have been given to him to send to your
aid, one thousand of the West Tennessee mounted men, should you
not succeed in raising the volunteer force authorized by my letter of
May 25th."
You will immediately communicate to General Scott your views
upon the matter & likewise upon the subject of your operations gen-
erally, as his movements and yours, may affect each other.
I enclose also, an extract of the instructions of January 21st given
to General Scott on the subject of the final disposition of the Seminole
Indians." Should you succeed in reducing them to submission, you
will carry into effect the measures directed in that letter. The Tennes-
see troops will be armed," and I presume that you have ere this, pro-
cured a sufficient quantity of arms for the use of such of your militia,
as from time to time, may be called into service. Colonel Bomford”
will correspond with you on the subject of arms and ammunition.

General Towson” has directed a Paymaster to proceed immediately
to Tallahassee, who I presume will have reached there before you
receive this letter. He will pay all the militia & volunteers who have
been or may be in the service of the United States. General Towson
will communicate with you upon this subject. I understand that
Captain Shannon is at Tallahassee, with full authority to make all
payments on account of the Quarter Masters Department. The
Acting Quarter Master General will inform you of his arrangements.
The Commissary General of Subsistence will also communicate with
you on the subject of provisions, and all requisitions which you may
find it necessary to make upon the Officers of the various departments,
in order to carry on your operations, will be promptly complied with.
All the necessary means will be placed at their disposal. The Surgeon
General "will in like manner, communicate with you.
You were some time since informed that arrangements were made
for the employment of five steam boats, and for having a part of
these manned by seamen from the Navy. You will perceive, that in
my instructions to General Scott, I have requested him to allow one
or more of these boats to ply in such places as you may direct. I
would recommend that you correspond with him upon this point, and
also with the proper naval Officer. Should you however, not receive
the aid of these boats, and should require them, you will procure them
elsewhere if praticable, and should you find boats of other descriptions
necessary, you are at liberty to have them purchased or constructed,
and indeed to procure whatever else may be necessary, to your opera-

Collector's Office S*AUGUSTINE 23 July 1836
SIR, I cannot any longer forbear from troubling you with my com-
plaints, against the negligence of the official conduct of Samuel Blair
Esq., the Marshal of the United States, for this district, in Florida;
and also that of his deputy, who pretends to act for the Marshal,
during his absence.
M Blair himself resides about forty miles from this City, on the
S" Johns river, and rarely comes to his office here, more than once in
two or three months, and then remains here only a day or two. Con-
sequently his personal attendance to the duties of his office, is of very
little public use. His deputy is extremely negligent and inattentive
to the duties of the Office. The room in the City Hall here, where
our Courts are held, and other public offices are kept, and which is in
the center of this town, and which room is very pleasant and con-
venient; but it is the last place in the City where the Marshal or his
deputy is to be found, at any hour of the day.
The deputy himself has lately been absent from this City, for eight
or ten days, and some other person, not known, has acted, as the
deputy of the deputy, the Marshal himself not being here at all.

It appears to me that such negligence of Official duty is not known,
in any other district of Florida, or City in the United States.
I have been driven to make these complaints, by the Shameful
misconduct of this deputy marshal, yesterday and to day. Yesterday
I had issued by the Clerk of the Superior Court, in a very important
and pressing law proceeding—a writ of Replevin, called a precept,
and it was delivered to the deputy Marshal yesterday, with a request
to serve it immediately. He had ample time to do so yesterday, but
seeing him accidentally in the Street this morning, he told me that
he had not yet served it. I again requested him to execute the busi-
ness without delay, but it is now in the evening, and nothing in the
matter has been done, and I can find him no where.
In New York I well know, that the Marshal of the United States,
and the Sheriff in the City, are very prompt in doing their official
duty; but I am sorry to say, that dilatory and negligent conduct is a
prevailing vice in Florida.
I have not the least animosity to Mr Blair or to his deputy. M"
Blair himself is a very courteous and gentlemanly man, and when the
Court is sitting here, he regularly attends to his official duties, but
when no court is held, he is not to be found in his office, whether
even when he be is in town er het, except very rarely.
I practice law in this Territory, especially in this City and in Jack-
sonville, consequently have frequent occasion for the official services
of the Marshal of the United States or his deputy, who performs the
duty of a Sheriff in the States of our Union.
With great respect, I have the honor to be Sir, Your ob" Serv"

Collector's Office KEY WEST August 1, 1836.—
STEPHEN PLEASONTON Esq. Fifth Auditor &c
SIR—It becomes my painful duty to announce to you, that on the
23" Ultimo a party of about forty Indians made an Attack on the
Light house at Cape Florida, and burned all the buildings at that
place. The two men there in charge, Thompson & Carter, were
hired by Mr. Dubose, to remain there constantly, while he occasion-
ally comes to Key West to Visit his family. Dubose had left the
Light house to Visit Key West five days before the attack of the
Indians. So sudden & unexpected was the attack, that these men
had hardly time to get into the Light House. The Indians after
exchanging a few shots, made a fire against the light-house door,
from which it soon communicated to the oil & other combustible
materials kept on the ground floor & to the Stairs—The two men
retreated into the lantern carrying with them a Keg of powder, with
which the Keeper had been furnished for the purpose of defence.
The wooden suttle soon gave way before the flames, and the heat
compelled these men to go on the out-side the lantern & lay down on
the platform. In this situation they were exposed in some degree
95 Not found.

to the rifles of the Indians, and to an intence heat, which melted the
glass from the lantern. There Thompson received three rifle balls
through one of his feet, was wounded in the ancle of his other ehe leg,
and Carter was Killed by a rifle ball. In this horrible situation,
Thompson finding the heat insupportable at length threw down the
Keg of powder through the scuttle—probably with the design of
distroying himself & building together—
But it is supposed, that it exploded near the door, as its principal
effect was to throw down the burning Stair-case, and deaden the
fire. The U.S. Transport, Scho Motto was within sight of the burn-
ing buildings, & the crew heard the explosion, but on account of
light & adverse could not approach nearer than seven miles of the
scene that night. The next morning, the wind being still unfavor-
able, two boats were manned from the Motto & proceed to the Cape.
On their way, they recovered a Sloop boat, which the Indians had
taken & in which they had deposited their plunder It was found
impossible to rescue Thompson from his elevated situation that day,
as every effort made to shoot up a line proved abortive—The day after
however it was accomplished. The day fellewing, after he had been
suffering there more than thirty six hours. The other man, Carter,
was burried & the place abandoned. Thompson was brought to
this place & is in a fair way to do well—indeed his recovery is deemed
certain, but it is feared he will be a cripple for life. He being a
seaman by profession, and only volunteering for a short time in this
exposed situation, I have thought it but equitable to extend the usual
aid to sick and disabled seamen. This is the only aid I felt authorised
to extend, without the sanction of the Department.—
The gale of august last, had injured the foundations of these build-
ings, & it was doubtful if the Keepers house could have been re-
paired—The light house was badly cracked, even before the explosion
of gun powder. It is believe the whole will require re-building so
soon as the Indian hostility ceases—If so, I would suggest, that that
their location be changed to Soldier's Key about five miles southerly,
and about the same distance nearer the Reef-There it will afford
a safer land mark, both to Wessels passing the Gulf & to those passing
inside the Reef. It is also believed there will be greater comfort &
exemption from mosquitoes"—

which office was heretofore, very properly abolished, as altogether
useless, we take the liberty of stating to you our opinion and belief,
that such an Officer is less necessary now, and would greatly tend to
embarrass and delay the settlement of these claims, and would be of
serious disadvantage to the government; but should you consider
otherwise, we beg leave further respectfully to state, that being well

To HON” LEWIS CASS Secretary of War.
SIR, I have the honor to submit, for your consideration the en-
closed copies of two letters from Archibald Smith jr. Esq Agent
residing among the Appalachicola Indians.”
It will be Seen, that the Indians mentioned by the Agent are a
part of those to whom the Government guaranteed the peaceable
possession of certain reservations of land by the Treaty of Camp
Moultrie, dated 18 Sep 1823. The Agent represents them to be
now, and to have ever been, peaceable and friendly towards the
whites, and that, indeed, when called upon by the Governor of Flor-
ida, they Sent their warriors to battle for the United States. It
further appears, that the operations of the War have reduced these
Indians to a condition peculiarly unfortunate and oppressed. They
have been Subjected to the hostilities of the Seminoles, and the
treachery and plunder of the whites. They have been robbed of
their Slaves and other property, and driven from their homes; and
having been prevented from raising their usual crops, they are greatly
Suffering for Subsistence. They have applied to this Office for Some
corn and beef. Not conceiving it to be the province of this Office
to furnish the Supply asked for, I refer the matter to the Secretary
of War in the hope that he will consider that the necessities of these
people may be relieved under the “Resolution authorizing the Presi-
dent to furnish rations to certain inhabitants of Florida,” passed
February 1" 1836;” or at least under the law of usage which has
authorized, at all times, the issuing of provisions to Suffering Indians.”

July M Rodman writes to M' Fontane (a copy of his letter of that
date I herewith enclose Marked N° 2)" accusing him of not having
executed the writ, but also of not having made any return of it—
If M Rodman did not go to the Clerks Office from the 23" to the
25" to ascertain whether the writ was returned or not, he was surely
negligent of his own interest, and not knowing whither the accusation
against M. Fontane was true or not (and he could not know without
going to the Clerks Office) it was certainly unjustifiable on his part to
make it—If he did go between the 23" and 25" and ascertained that
the writ was returned (which he must have ascertained if he went
there) then the accusation against the Deputy contained in his letter
of the 25" must I think be attributed to Motives not altogether
correct—In this letter he remarks “on a complaint made against
him (M" Blair) about a year ago for his negligence, he was severely
repremanded by the Government” If such a repremand is on file
in the State Department I am entirely ignorant of its contents as
I have never received from the State or other Department any com-
munication of that character.
It is true that I reside nearly forty miles to the Westward of S"
Augustine, and it is also true that my District extends from East
to West about one hundred and fifty miles, S*Augustine being on the
extreme East; and from North to South about two hundred—there
are three other places besides S*Augustine at which Terms of the
Superior Court are held, at each of those places I must of necessity
have a deputy, whe are het upon whose integrity I can rely, but who
sometimes commit errors because they are not familiar with business,
and are at a loss sometimes how to proceed; I have hence found it
necessary to fix my residence as near the center of business in the
District as possible in order particularly that I may superintend the

business of these Western Counties as far as possible—I do this with
the greater safety as I have two Deputies in S*Augustine, one of whom
particularly (I speak of M" Fontane) is so familiar with all the duties
of the Office, & so prompt and active in the discharge of those duties
that I have never been disappointed in his manner of transacting
business connected with the Office."
Mr Rodman states in his letter to the Secretary that “he (M*
Blair) rarely comes to his Office here (S' Augustine) more than once
in two or three months”—I refer you to the enclosed communica-
tions Marked N* 3, 4, 5 & 6 * in reference to this charge; I cannot
forbear expressing my astonishment that M Rodman should have
made this charge, as I have never I believe at any one period been
out of St Augustine for a greater length of time than from ten to
fifteen days, a fact of which M Rodman must have been conscious
at the time he made the statement, as I believe we have frequently
met whenever I have been in S* Augustine—I was in the act of
leaving St Augustine when your letter was received, & while the
Clerk was copying the Writ enclosed, the communications N* 3, 4,
5 and 6 were handed to me. I could have procured the testimony of
every man in the City to the same point but thought it unnecessary,
particularly as I had business which required my presence at this
place
Mr Rodman charges that even during my absence M. Fontane has
himself been absent—this I know to be true, but Mr Rodman is
perfectly aware that there is another Deputy there always ready to
attend to the business of the Office, I say he must be aware of this
fact, as I think this Deputy (M Avice) must have transacted busi-
ness for and with M Rodman as he has been constantly discharging
the duties of Deputy Marshal for nearly five years past. But not
satisfied with trying to produce the empression that the City is left
sometimes without the Marshal or a Deputy, M Rodman continues
by stating, that “some other person not known has acted as the Deputy
of the Deputy”—if M Rodman had not known this statement to be
untrue at the time he made it, he would not have rested a day or
night until he found out “the person not known,” and all the par-
ticulars connected with the case in which it occurred—the statement
so far as I can examine is I do not hesitate to say utterly untrue
11 Judge Reid informed the Secretary of State, Aug. 24, 1836 (NA, SD, Appli-
cations), that the constant presence of the marshal at St. Augustine was not
necessary, as his deputy was efficient and always present.

I believe I have noticed all the charges made by M Rodman and
I hope to the satisfaction of your Department, if however I am mis-

SIR/I am advised by the War Department that you have been
ordered by the proper authority to co-operate with me in conducting
the war against the Seminole Indians. The Brigade of Tennessee
Volunteers, and the Troops from Middle and West Florida will
march from this place on the 19* and the campaign will open on the
25* Inst in the Northern part of the enemy's country. It is ex-
pected that another division of the Army will be in operation in that
part of the Nation embracing the Bay of Tampa and Charlottes
Harbour, in a few weeks; As far as the Army can march to the South,
the country will be traversed and it is hoped the enemy will be routed
or destroyed. But there is a district commencing a short distance
South of Cape Carmanal on the eastern, and the Charlotte Harbour
on the Western margin of the Peninsula which can only be penetrated
in boats;—The Water on the ever glades so far as I have been able
to collect information varies from two to Six feet in depth. Within
this region it is represented there are many Islands to which the
Indians resort in canoes, and on some of which they have permanent
settlements. It is reported to me that there are two or three hundred
of them assembled on New river, and on the Keys along the Coast,

the number may be exagerated, but the burning of the Light House
at Cape Florida, and other recent discoveries render it certain that
the enemy is to be found in that quarter in some force. I would
respectfully suggest that the most effective co-operation you can
give to the Land forces in the prosecution of the war will be by sending
an expedition in boats to act in that part of the Peninsula. The very
limited information I possess on the subject does not enable me to
suggest the kind of Boats which may be required for this service, it
is most probable however that those of the lightest draught would
be best adapted, though many of the Bayons and inlets are said to
be deep enough to receive boats of the largest size. I have no infor-
mation which will enable me to suggest the number of men, and boats
which should be employed in this service. On this subject as well as
the time when the expedition might proceed with safety, your own
intelligence and that of the Naval Officers will best determine. The
region to be explored being almost entirely unknown, many unfore-
seen obstacles may be anticipated in the progress of the expedition.
At Key West and Indian Key the best guides can be obtained to
lead to the present location of the Indians.

SIR On the 19" of February last” I informed you that the 2*
Compt of the Treasury had transmitted to this office for suit, an
authenticated transcript of an account against you as acting Governor
of Florida, exhibiting a balance of $8.440, due from you to the U,
States.
That before directing Suit to be instituted which of course should
be done by the appointment of a Special Attorney, to act for the
United States, I had thought proper to apprize you of the papers
being in my hands, with the hopes that you might have it in your
power to make arrangements for the settlement of the claim in a
reasonable time, and thereby save me the necessity of directing a
Suit.—
In your reply dated March 8, 1836,” you informed me that you
would forthwith transmit to this office duplicates of accounts and
vouchers heretofore transmited to the proper Department, Shewing
the disbursements of the moneys charged to you, &c.—
Those papers not coming to hand agreeably to your promise, I
again on the 25, of May last addressed you on the Subject,” with a
* Authorized by act approved July 2, 1836 (5 STAT. 106).
* Daniel Anderson Vallambrosa Fl Ter. $1500 [Marginal note on the pamphlet].
In addition to Anderson, the successful bidder (NA, PO, Mail Route Register),
other bids were submitted by W. S. Mooring ($2300) and by McLean and Gunn
($3475). A marginal note in the register states that the contractor began service
on Mar. 14, 1837, and ended it on May 24, 1837. Cf post, p. 364.

Confidential FORT DRANE 22d Oct 1836
MY DEAR GENL I wrote you a haisty note on the 19* Ins' * Since
when nothing of importance has occurred, except the death of Co'
Lane" commander of the Creek Volunteers, who in a paroxism of
delirium, committed suicide in a few hours after he arrived in my
camp. In this valuable officer the Service has Sustained a Severe
loss, but I am happy to Say that the Indians have become reconciled,
and evince every disposition to prosecute the war with vigour. I
have Sent all the mounted men to forage at Black Creek. In a few
days I shall have the fort and store houses at this place reestablished,
and a good stock of provisions brought in. So soon as the officer
returns whom I sent to the mouth of the Withlacoochie (viz) S"
Marks, I Shall march with the force at this place consisting of the
Creek Warriors, and a few Regular Troops, and open a communica-
tion with our Supplies in that quarter, which will be in the heart of
their country, and within thirty miles of the Strong hold of the enemy.
Allow me General to call your particular attention to the Officers of
the Army now under my command. Among the Captains and Subal-
terns there are some officers of distinguished merit, but the field
officers generally so far as their conduct has come under my obser-
vation with the exception of Maj Pierce" are totally inefficient. I
do nothing more than common justice to Maj Pierce when I say that
he is one of the most energetic, efficient and valuable Officers I have
ever known. Indeed Sir I cannot say more of him than he deserves,
and but for his extraordinary exertions after the abandonment of

Micanopy by order of Col Crane * the frontier would have been
desolated, and this army would have suffered greatly for the want of
supplies, for I had depended on Micanopy as a temporary depot, and
had ordered Col Crane to throw a large quantity of supplies in to
that post, and did not hear of its abandonement until a few days
before the arrival of the Tennessee Troops. This gave the enemy
undisputed possession of the country, and I could not introduce
supplies until I march the army in to protect them. The Gallant
attack made by Maj Pierce on the enemy at this place on the 48 21"
of August, with a force so greatly inferior, and the entire Success
with which it was attended, entitles him in my opinion, to the brevet
Rank of Liut Col Col, and the extraordinary exertions made by him
since that time, in defending the frontier, in acting in the field with
me, and inforwarding Supplies to the army entitles him to a further
advancement and the brevet rank of Colonel. By bestowing this
rank upon him, you will not only reward distinguished merit, but
you will give efficiency to the Army by placing him in a Situation to
command all the liut Colnels some of whom at least are perfect drones,
and would be of no Service in the field. I have also to request that
Liuts Irwine,” and Hubert” who were with Maj Pierce in the action
of the +8.21" of August, and who were distinguished for their gallantry
on that occasion may both be breveted.
There is one subject General on which I feel it my duty to lodge a
complaint with you. It is against the manner in which the officers
of the army under my command are ordered away and are furloughed
without my knowledge or consent. Lieut Col Foster * of the 4'
Inf, who managed to get off to Batton Rouge immediately after Genl
Scott left the field, when ordered back to Florida on my application,
returned to his post where he did not remain more than three or four
weeks, when he rec" a furlough from the War department, and is
still absent. Within a few days past Liut Pickell * has been ordered
to joine Col Fenwick * at Baltimore as his Adj. and Liut Irwine, has
been ordered to joine Genl Eustice" at Charleston in the same ca-
pacity.
These Officers both left the Territory before I was apprised of the
order, but for this I should not have permited it, as we have now less
than one officer for every two companies. The want of Officers I
assure you Sir is severely experienced, and I have to request that

TO GEN CHARLES GRATIOT Chief Engineer
Report of the Progress made in the Improvement of the Inland
Navigation between the S" Mary's and St John's Rivers to the 30"
September 1836; as follows.
The year ending 30 September 1835, the undersigned was in-
structed in March to examine this route in person, and prepare a
Project of Operations for the approval of the Dep** An examination
in person took place in June and a Partial Project was accordingly
submitted " and approved by the Dep" and arrangements entered
into for the construction of a Dredge Boat & Mud flats & the neces-
sary machinery &c. &c, which it was expected would be got into
operation in January following.
During the year ending 30° September 1836, a Dredge Boat, two
Mud flats & one wood flat were completed. On the 7" Dec as soon
as two of the flats were finished, they were sent to Amelia Dividings,
under the control of an overseer with instructions to take hands that
had been engaged at S*Mary's and proceed to removing the oyster
beds as far as practicable, till the Dredge Boat be got ready. On
the 15" December the overseer & hands were at work at low water
removing the obstructions at Amelia Dividings. 30" December Lt
James S. Williams entered on his duties as assistant. On the 3"
January Lt Williams was despatched with the Steamer Essayons and
one flat in tow for Amelia Dividings: with a view to afford the aid
of an additional flat to the overseer & to inspect, and make a recon-
naissance, preparatory to a Survey of the dividings west of Talbot
Island. The flats and hands were removed in January to the Sisters
to break up the oyster beds preparatory to dredging.

Secretary of War, July 5, 1836 (NA, WD, HQA Lets. Recd.). See post, p. 339.

The 12* January Lt Williams received instructions to make a
Survey of Talbot Dividings, in order to ascertain precisely what mode
be best to overcome the difficulties of many short turns in a narrow
and shallow channel. He had commenced this Survey but had made
but little progress when he received orders direct from the adjutant
Genl. to join the undersigned from Engineer Duty. His labour as
well as the expense of making preparations for the Survey were lost
as not enough had been done to render his notes worth preserving."
The 3d March the overseer & his hands were Ordered back to Cock-
spur Island to take charge of the Dredge Boat as soon as it be finished.
It was not however till the 23" June, that the Dredge was completed
& left the Savannah River in tow of the Steamer Florida with the
undersigned: and was established at work on the 28* of the same
month at Amelia Dividings. From that date it has removed 1,300.
cubic yards of mud &c from the bottom of the channel way, and ac-
cording to the report of the Captain has improved materially this
passage. The operation of dredging is necessarily slow in this passage
as the Boat can only work when afloat and in this way can load but
the two flats about at high water. The expediency of increasing the
number of flats will soon be the subject of serious consideration.
In consequence of having been refused the assistant from the De-
partment that was applied for, the undersigned has not been able to
make a complete project for this Improvement. Yet in addition to
the Partial Project already submitted, he has been enabled to obtain
a hasty survey of the dividings west of Talbot Island (see A hereunto
annexed): and proposes that the cut from C to D therein recom-
mended, be decided on by the Department for the present, as the
undersigned agrees with the Gentleman Mr Wim O. Williams who
made this survey, and doubts, on a hasty view of the matter, the
expediency of the long cut from D to E.

THE ACTING SECRETARY OF WAR TO GOVERNOR CALL
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 16*]
November 4, 1836.
HIS EXCELLY R. K. CALL Governor of Florida -
SIR, On the 29" ultimo, a rumor reached this City, through the
Charleston papers, that you had marched with the troops under
your immediate command, to the Wythlacoochie, and there discovered
the enemy in considerable force, and that instead of crossing the
river and attacking him, you had fallen back upon Fort Drain to
obtain provisions. From the tenor of your last despatch, under
date of October 10*, * in which you stated, that Major Pierce had
united with you the day before, making your force thirteen hundred
and fifty strong, and bringing seven days rations for the whole Army;
that with these supplies, you intended marching to the Wythlacoochie,
in the hope of encountering the enemy in his strong holds; and that
the depots at Volusia and at the mouth of the Wythlacoochie, would
afford the means of replenishing your supplies, it was confidently
hoped that this rumor would prove erroneous. It was, however,
substantially confirmed by various communications received during
the early part of the present week, which also gave us the additional
intelligence, that Colonel Lane with the regulars and friendly Indians
under his command, after marching from Tampa Bay to the Wythla-
coochie, had also retired to Fort Drane: that the Tennessee Brigade,
having sustained a serious loss in horses, and being destitute of forage,
had been moved to Black Creek; and that in consequence of these
untoward events and for the want of horses, transportation, and
supplies, your operations are likely to be suspended for several weeks.
The mails since, though they have not brought us any communication
from yourself, have finished ample details as to all these events, which
have been still further elucidated by the verbal statements of Lieu-
tenant Mitchell, lately of your Staff, who it appears had been des-
patched to this place and to Philadelphia, on business connected
with the replenishing of your supplies. That Officer also reports,

that at the time of his departure, you were suffering severely from
sickness and fatigue.
In the mean time, the preparation of such orders from this Depart-
ment, as the exigency of the case requires, has been deferred, in the
hope of receiving your Official report; but the mail of the last night
having failed to bring it, it is deemed indispensable to the public
interests, to take, without further delay, such measures as appear
to be required by the facts within the knowledge of the Department.
Although no definitive judgment has been formed as to the occur-
rences above referred to, I am yet instructed by the President, to
express to you his disappointment and surprize, that you should
have commenced the execution of a campaign of so much importance,
and so long meditated, without first taking effectual measures to secure
all needful supplies, from the various depots which for several months
have been subject to your orders; and above all, that after approach-
ing with so large a force within so short a distance of the enemy, and
finding him apparently disposed to give battle, you should have re-
tired without a more serious attempt to cross the river and to drive
him from his position. This disappointment and regret are greatly
increased by the consideration that these retrograde movements will
probably have the effect to expose the frontiers to new invasions by
marauding parties, and to encourage the Indians in their resistance,
thereby increasing beyond what might otherwise have been needed,
the severity of the measures which will now be required to subdue
them. It is due to these considerations and also to the Army and
to yourself, that the circumstances connected with your late move-
ments, should be distinctly explained: and in case you shall not have
transmitted a full report on the subject, before the receipt of this
communication, you will do so without delay. In the mean time it
is hoped, that the Army will soon be prepared to resume offensive
operations. But as there is reason to fear that the state of your
health will not allow you to finish the campaign, with the prompti-
tude and energy which the cricis demands, the President deems it
expedient to relieve you from the command. By his direction, I
have therefore this day instructed Major General Jesup, if he shall
not already have united with you, to do so at once, or to communicate
with you on the subject without delay, and thereupon to assume the
command of the Army serving in Florida, which you will accordingly
be pleased to transfer to him. A copy of the despatch to him is
herewith transmitted to you, and the original is borne by the same
messenger, who will deliver you this communication.
Should General Jesup not be at your headquarters, on the arrival
of the messenger, you will take the earliest measures to despatch
him to the place where you shall have the best reasons to suppose

that Officer will be found, with the utmost expedition; and in the
mean time, you will make all such dispositions as may be in your
power for promoting the plan of the campaign prescribed in the in-
structions to General Jesup. And after he shall have relieved you,
you will also be pleased to cooperate, so far as the state of your health
and your other engagements may allow, in the execution of his

THE ACTING SECRETARY OF WAR TO THOMAS S. JESUP
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 16 *]

MAJOR GEN THOMAS S. JESUP U States Army. Florida.
SIR, Before this communication reaches you, you will have become
fully acquainted with the retrograde movements of Governor Call,
and the other events connected therewith, which have recently
occurred in Florida. These circumstances have for a time suspended
offensive operations; and from the feeble state of Governor Call's
health, it is to be feared that he will not be able to prosecute the
campaign, when resumed, with that promptitude and energy which
the crisis demands. The President has therefore determined to
commit to you the command of the army serving in Florida, and the
general direction of the war against the Seminoles.
You will accordingly, on the receipt of this communication should
you then be at Governor Call's headquarters, and if not, so soon as
you can reach there, or can communicate with him, assume the
command of all the forces in the Territory.”
The hostile Indians having been discovered in considerable force
on the banks of the Wythlacoochie, and it having been also ascer-
tained that their principal Camps and settlements are situated on
the south side of that river, you will immediately make all suitable
arrangements for a vigorous attack upon their strongholds, and for
penetrating and occupying the whole country between the Wythla-
* Relevant correspondence and other documents concerning Call's appoint-
ment as commander, his defeat at Withlacoochee, and his removal from command
are extensively printed in H. Exec. Doc. 278, 26 Cong., 1 sess. The papers in
question were submitted to the Senate in a message of the President, Mar. 11,

coochie and Tampa Bay. With a view to this end, you will first
establish posts at or near the mouth of the Wythlacoochie, at Fort
King, and at Volusia; and you will take the proper measures for
securing through them, the safety of the frontier. You will also
through the same posts, and by such means of transportation as may
be most certain and economical, make permanent arrangements for
procuring sufficient and regular supplies. So soon as those disposi-
tions shall be completed, you will concentrate all your disposable
forces, and proceed without delay to cross the Wythlacoochie, and
to possess yourself of the positions now occupied by the Indians;
attacking and routing them in their strongholds, and scouring the
whole country between the Wythlacoochie and Tampa Bay.
Should you succeed in bringing the Indians to a general engagement,
and in defeating them therein, the ready submission of the tribe may
probably be expected. If however, they should abandon their
present position on the Wythlacoochie, before you reach it, or you
should drive them from it, without entirely subduing them, you will
then take such advanced positions to the South of Volusia and to
the East and South of Tampa Bay, as the nature of the country may
admit, and push from them such further operations, as may be neces-
sary to the most speedy and effectual subjugation of the enemy.
The above direction to attack the enemy in his strongholds and to
possess yourself of the country between the Wythlacoochie and
Tampa Bay, you will regard as a positive order, to be executed at
the earliest practicable moment. In other respects, you will exercise
a sound discretion, and will adopt such measures as you may deem
best calculated to protect the frontiers and to effect the subjugation
and removal of the Indians.
Great confidence being reposed in your prudence, energy and skill,
it is deemed unnecessary to urge you to promptitude or activity, or
to impress on you the importance of early and frequent communi-
cations.

[NA:WD, CE Lets. to Officers of Engrs., Bk. 6]
Engineer Department WASHINGTON Nov 11 1836
LT. J. K. F. MANSFIELD Corps of Engrs Savannah Geo:
SIR/I have examined M. Williams' project for improving the Tal-
bott narrows in the inland passage between St: Marys & St Johns
and, with him, entertain doubts whether the longer cut suggested
from E to D of the plan would insure the navigation the most perma-
nent good.” The effect of the cut would give to the current a much
increased velocity by diminishing the length of the channel between
the two points, thereby causing a greater removal of sand or earth in
its course which must again be deposited at some point a little be-
yond where the influence of this increased current is felt, and, conse-
quently, there must be a failure in the intended object.—My own
idea on the subject is that streams in their effort to find the lower
level in alluvion do so by following the longest line that will admit
of a gentle current, which will not abrase or disturb the banks of the
canal they have formed for themselves—hence the sinuous course
often observed—and it appears reasonable that, in the effort to deepen
them, care should be taken as much as is practicable, to confine the
improvement to the way indicated by nature, and if any change is
to be made in this it should be merely in widening the water way at
points where it is too narrow for the purposes of safe and easy navi-
gation; as at the point F, of the plan, where the turn is so short as
scarcely to give room for the passage of two boats at the same time.
By adopting this suggestion a uniform plane of descent would be
maintained and the liability of new bars forming in consequence of
an accelerated current at occasional points much diminished.
Believing the foregoing theory to be correct, I therefore recommend
its application to the improvement in question.”

HON LEVI WOODBURY Secretary of the Treasury
SIR—The keeper of the Cape Florida Light-house was formerly an
Inspector of the Customs, and as the distruction of that Lighthouse
by the Indians” has occasioned the removal of that officer some
detriment may arise to the Revenue of the country should no one
in that quarter be properly authorised to guard against any intended
infringement of the laws—I would therefore respectfully nominate
John Whalton—Master of the Floating Light on Carysford Reef—to
supply the vacancy caused by the removal of John Dubose late
Inspector.—
As the principal service rendered by an inspector on that portion
of the Florida Coast consists in preventing the improper disposition
of any portion of the Cargo of vessels from foreign ports that may be
wrecked I consider the station of Captain Whalton in many respects
a better location for such an officer than Cape Florida:—it being in
the immediate vicinity of the dangerous reefs where such wrecks
occur and in the direct path of passing Wessels engaged in wrecking—
Should the nomination meet your approval I presume there would
be no objection on the part of the Department to allowing Captain
Whalton the same salary that was allowed to his predecessor—

I shall surrender most cheerfully to Gen' Jessup the command of
the army in which the President has been pleased to supercede me,
and have given Lieut: Johnston every facility in my power to find
the camp of that officer. I must be permitted to say that I regarded
your letter as the most extraordinary document I have ever read.
It informed me of a rumour which had reached Washington very
unfavourable to my conduct & military character. It reminds me
of the means, and supposed means I possessed of achieving a victory
over the enemy. Of the unwillingness of of the department to credit
the rumours, but that it had been substantially confirmed by various
communications rec" &c and further “elucidated” by the verbal
statement of Lieut: “Mitchell” late of my staff &c
You proceed to state that “no definitive Judgement has been formed
as to the circumstances above refered to’’ and that although no
definite Judgement has been formed as to the occurrences above
refered to,” you are yet instructed by the President to pronounce,
on me what every one must conceive to be the deepest censure, and
to supercede me in the command of the army. Thus inflicting the
severest penalty & the highest disgrace, in the power of the president
to visit upon me, were my guilt established by the most incontro-
vertable testimony. All this is done without waiting to receive my
official report, which I am called on to make without delay
Now Sir should I be so fortunate as to shew by a plain statement of
facts, which can be supported by the oaths of hundreds of honorable
men that injustice has been done me, can the injury be repaired?
May I hope for that magnanimity, which will acknowledge error,
and redress wrong?
My official report of the incidents of the march to, and from the
Withlacoochee was made to the late Secretary of War and forwarded
from Fort Drane on the 19* of Oct" last.” It was made while suffer-
ing under the most severe indisposition & does not do justice to many
of the officers under my command or to myself. But I did not feel
culpable for anything that occured, and therefore made no defence
of my conduct. Lest it should not have been received by the De-
partment a copy is herewith enclosed. Allow me to offer a remark
on the evidence on which I have been condemned. As to the “ru-
mour” it is intangible, and I shall say nothing about it, nor are the

my estimation to higher credit, as they must have been destitute of

whole matter and whom you seem to have considered as a member of
my staff, sent on to Washington and Philadelphia by me, on business
connected with the replenishing of my supplies, I must say if he made
such representations, he was truly unfortunate in communicating
facts. For the want of an ordinance officer so often complained of
to the department by the Officers in command in Florida, I appointed
Mr. Mitchell to take charge of the amunition in the same order in
which my staff was announced to the army. He marched with us
from Suwanee old Town and lived in the family of Gen' Armstrong *
until a few days before our return from the Withlacoochee to Fort
Drane, where he came into the mess with myself and staff. On our
arrival at the latter place he applied for permission to go to Black
creek which was readily granted
He suggested that he might be of service in procuring and forward-
ing the clothing and Blankets which I intended to order the Quarter
Master at Black creek to purchase, for the friendly Indians, as it
had been represented by their commander that they were in great
want of those articles.
At Black Creek I understood he applied to one of my aids then at
that place for an order to proceed to Charleston and Philadelphia to
make those purchases. This was done without my knowledge &
certainly very contrary to my intention, as I did not wish him to
go further than Black Creek. He has forwarded no clothing for the
Indians, nor has he made any report of his proceeding. I have to
request that this officer may be ordered without delay to join his
company at Fort Clinch on the Withlacoochee. As to his having
been sent by me to replenish my supplies, the statement is erroneous
The Indians were almost naked and I felt it my duty to have them
clothed on the requisition of their Commander. I shall now proceed
to answer the complaints or accusations which you were instructed
by the President to prefer against me in the order in which they are
made. And first as it regards his “disappointment and surprise that
I should have commenced the execution of a campaign of so much
importance & so long meditated without first taking effectual measures
to secure the necessary supplies”
When I formed my plan of campaign which was submitted to the
Department, Micanopy but ten miles distant from Fort Drane was
held as a military Post, and was relyed on as one of the depots, from
whence supplies could be drawn for the use of the army while engaged
in that quarter. Tampa Bay was another depot already established,
and I proposed another near the mouth of the Withlacoochee, and
one at this place. So soon as I was advised of the time when the

Tennesseeans would leave their Cantonment in Alabama for Florida,
I send an express to Col. Crane" commanding the forces in East
Florida to employ the whole transport train at Black Creek in carry-
ing supplies to Micanopy. In a few days after this I learned with
surprise and embarrassment that Miconopy had been abandoned by
that officer
This gave the enemy undisputed possession of the country for forty
miles further north. They were bravely met and fought on several
occasions by Cols. Warren" & Mills of Florida and Capt Thomkins”
of the U.S. Artillery. But they were too numerous for our forces and
I had not the means of driving them back and advancing other posts,
until I entered the Country with the Tennessee Brigade. In pur-
suance of my plan of campaign abundant supplies of every kind
were deposited at Black Creek, and Steam Boats were in readiness with
which provisions and forage could be conveyed to this place in 12
hours
Thus, on the Eastern margin of the Peninsula I was as fully prepared
as the nature of the country would admit of, and as any Gen could
have been at the opening of a campaign. On the Western side of
the Peninsula I had only sufficient force to establish a depot at the
Suwanee Old Town where supplies were placed for the use of the army
when advancing into the enemy's country. At St Marks ample
stores of every kind were deposited ready to be conveyed to the
Withlacoochee, whenever the Army should advance to use and pro-
tect them.
Before this it was impossible with the means which I possessed to
establish that depot.
On the 19* day of September I marched with the Tennessee Brigade
from Tallahassee for Suwanee Old Town, where we arrived on the
24* Before I left Tallahassee in addition to the supplies at the old
town, a large Brig loaded with an assorted Cargo had sailed from
S’ Marks to the mouth of the Suwanee. Other vessels were known to
be on their way from New Orleans with additional supplies, and the
Quarter master was ordered to charter a still further number to carry
the public stores from S' Marks to the same destination. The Steam
Boat Minerva calculated from her draft of water to enter and ascend
the Withlacoochee, then lying at Mount Vernon on the Apalachicola,
was chartered on the 17" of Sept to take in a cargo of forage and
amunition from one of Gen Jessup's depots on the Chatahoochee and
proceed to the mouth of the Suwanee, where she was by appointment

to be on the 24" of Sept The Steamboats sent me by the Govern-
ment under the command of naval officers, were already in the Su-
wanee river, where I found them on my arrival. One of these boats,
the Izard was ordered by Comd: Dallas to return to Pensacola.
The other two required repairs, and their crews were prostrate by
disease. I ordered the Izard to remain and permitted the other two,
neither of which could enter the Withlacoochee to proceed to Pensa-
cola for supplies and fresh crews, expecting them to return as soon
as possible. But they have never yet returned to their station, nor
am I informed in what manner they have been employed by Comd:
Dallas. On the 29* day of Sept" Gen. Read of Florida, then at
Suwanee Old Town was selected for his well established intrepidity
of character, his untiring perseverence and his knowledge of the
Withlacoochee to take Command of a detachment of Florida militia,
and a small detachment of Regular troops daily expected from Key
West to arrive at the mouth of the Suwanee, and with the Steamboat
Izard and 2 large Barges, which of themselves were capable of thena-
selves carrying 600 barrels of freight to proceed to the mouth of the
Suwanee, where it was supposed he would find the Steam Boat
Minerva, and several other vessels with supplies, and proceed at once
with them all to the mouth of the Withlacoochee, only 35 miles dis-
tant, and to ascend the river with the steamboats and Barges, and
establish a depot at Grahams Camp about 15 or 20 miles above the
mouth.
Thus prepared, on the same day the 29" of September, the army
marched without a waggon train carrying ten days supply of pro-
visions on their riding and pack horses, to attack the enemy at Fort
Drane, which had been for some time abandoned by our troops—
The night before, an express was sent to Major Pierce" at Black
Creek, advising him of my intended movements and directing him
to advance without delay with his forces, add all the transport waggons
with supplies for the army, relying on the large crops of corn known
to have been made at Gen" Clinchs and M*Intoshes plantations for
forage for our horses. On the 1* day of October the army arrived
at Fort Drane and but for the escape of an Indian from a party we
surprised and destroyed about ten miles off who gave intelligence of
our approach, the whole Mickosucky tribe would have been surprised
and perhaps destroyed. We were greatly disappointed in finding no
corn at either the Plantation of Gen! Clinch or M*Intosh. Though
large crops were made it had all been destroyed by the Indians, and
Cattle, which had free access to the fields—
We however found an abundance of sugar cane on which our horses

were fed & on which they were greatly improved. The express sent
to Major Pierce did not, from some cause arrive at Black Creek by
three days as early as it should have done. But expecting my orders
to advance, his waggons were all loaded and in readiness, and in two
hours after the arrival of the express, though it was late at night, his
whole train was in motion, and he joined me on the evening of the
8" of October. I reported to the Department that he brought me
7 days rations for the whole army, this was according to the report
made to me at the time, but the estimate did not hold out and many
of the companies received but 5 days rations. With this supply I
resolved to follow the trail of the enemy in order to find his strong
hold in preference to taking the roads made by our armies in former
marches, and as a further security against the necessity of being
compelled to fall back for supplies in any contingency
I had ordered two Steamboats and several schooners to be laden
with forage and provisions, & to sail immediately up the S" Johns
river, and come to anchor in Lake George, there to await a signal
from me to advance to Volusia, only six miles distant. These orders
were promptly executed. The vessels ascended and took their sta-
tions, where they remained until they were ordered by an express
boat to return to Black Creek. The army marched on the evening
of the 9" from Fort Drane. The trail of the enemy led us to his
strong hold in the cove of the Withlacoochee. We arrived at this
point on the morning of the 13* That day was spent in attempting
to cross the river without success. The next morning, the 14" the
army having less than two days rations to subsist on, it became
necessary to march to one of the depots for relief. I found the Cove
of the Withlacoochee so much lower down the river than I expected
and consequently so much further from Volusia, that I deemed it
impossible for the army without great distress to reach the latter
place, as it would require a march of 6 or 7 days. I called a counsel
of war to advise with the officers and after hearing my views they were
adopted and it was almost unanimously determined, that we should
march to the depot ordered to be established on the Withlacoochee.
We accordingly took up the line of march for that place
Major Goff of the Tennessee Brigade was sent with 200 men in
advance to ascertain the situation of the depot. If he should not
find it, to fire signal guns with his whole command, until he received
a response from Gen. Read.” He advanced to Grahams Camp, the
place directed for the depot He remained there during the night of
the 15" the signal guns were fired on the evening preceding and on
that morning, without receiving a reply

Despairing of finding the depot, or of hearing from Gen' Read, the
country being impassable by land to the mouth of the river, and
having no boat to descend by water, he determined to retire, and sent
an express to meet and inform me of the result of his examination.
On the 16" the express met me about noon 10 or 12 miles from the
point designated for the depot. The army was immediately halted.
Gen' Read had not been heard from since the 29" of September, the
provisions of the army were almost entirely exhausted, relief must
be had as soon as practicable, or extreme suffering was the inevitable
consequence. The army could not reach Grahams camp on the
Withlacoochee that night. If we advanced further and spent two
more days without finding relief the consequences must have been
fatal. In this trying situation something must be done, and done
quickly. After a few moments consultation with Genl. Armstrong
and Major Pierce, I resolved to march to Fort Drane where it was
certain we could get Beef, for the army and sugar cane for the horses.
In this we were not disappointed, we reached Fort Drane the night
of the 17" an express was sent to Black Creek to forward supplies
which met the army with great dispatch and relieved its necessities.
I trust I have abundantly shewn that from the state of preparation
as early as the 29" of Sept that I had every reason to expect that the
depot ordered to be established at Grahams Camp on the Withlacoo-
chee would be completed by the 16" of October at least.
Let us now examine the causes and which are known positively
to have lead to this disappointment and to my distressing embar-
rassment. Before the 5" day of October Gen' Read was at the mouth
of the Withlacoochee with an abundant supply of everything for the
use of the army He ordered the officer commanding the Steam Boat
Izard to carefully examine the entrance into the mouth of the river,
then to enter and ascend to the point designated for the depot. In
this attempt the Steam Boat unfortunately through mistake or
accident was thrown across the Channel which being narrow, she
grounded at the bow and stern on full tide, and when the water fell,
she broke in two from the weight of her engine, and sunk. The
destination of the Steam Boat Minerva having been changed by
Gen' Jessup (certainly with no expectation that it would embarrass
my movements in the smallest degree) who ordered her as I have been
officially informed, by her enterprising Captain to take at least one
trip to the mouth of the Apalachicola with the Creek warriors before
she took in a cargo on the Chatahoochee for the Withlacoochee
She was also ordered by Col. Lane" to make a second trip in which
she was greatly delayed by a fall of the Chatachoochee, and instead

of arriving on the 24" of Sept" according to appointment, she did not
make her appearance until the 22" day of October. In the meantime
Gen' Read with his usual energy and untiring perseverence proceeded
to fortify a large Barge which he loaded with previsiens supplies,
and was in the act of passing the bar to ascend and establish the depot
at all hazards, when the Minerva appeared in view.
On that very day Gen' Read aided by that invaluable officer Col
Wood, a member of my staff, who had taken the temporary command
of the Minerva, for this expedition, succeeded in ascending the river
and establishing the depot, where there has been an abundant supply
of public stores ever since
Now sir permit me to ask, is the accusation just, and can it be
supported in truth, that I did commence “the execution of this im-
portant campaign without having first taking effectual measures to
secure all needful supplies” I answer that it is not, and the charge
cannot be supported, as it is proven by the fact that the Minerva
on the first day of her arrival succeeded in establishing the depot.
That the Steam Boat Izard should have been lost may be attributed
alone to the arrangement of the Government in selecting Naval
officers to navigate Steam Boats in narrow channels and rivers, who
have been instructed only in navigating ships on the ocean Had the
Izard been navigated by one, skillful from long practice in the manage-
ment of Steam Boats it is the opinion of Gen. Read that there would
have been no difficulty in ascending the Stream
It may be asked why I did not make known all these facts in my
official report of the 19" of October. I answer that many of them had
not then transpired, others were then unknown to me. But had
they all have been communicated on that day, they could not have
saved me, as the President was pleased to censure and supercede me
in command of the army on rumour, without waiting for my official
report. Having answered fully as I conceive the first ground of
complaint alledged against me, I proceed to the second charge
“That after approaching so near the enemy with so large a force,
and finding him disposed appearantly to give me battle, I should
have retired without a more serious attempt to cross the river and
drive him from his position” In answer to this charge I say and will
maintain with facts, that the passage of the river with the means I
possessed, and within the time in which our supplies required it to
be done, was a rational impossibility, and could not have been accom-
plished by Gen' Jackson himself
This fact was fully ascertained at the time, and has been further
confirmed to the satisfaction of the whole army on our last visit to
the cove

to the enemy. But I can assure the President that the brave Ten-
nesseeans, headed by their Gallant leader were impatient at every
moments delay in pursuing the enemy, and that they have never
stoped at any barrier, however formidable, which could be overcome
by hardy enterprise. When we arrived at the river on the morning
of the 13" Gen' Armstrong and myself entered the swamp with the
spies—and advanced guard. We had been induced to believe the
stream was fordable and that a passage could be forced in the presence
and under the fire of the enemy. Under this belief we resolved to
make the attempt. The spies through mistake had preceded the
guides, one of whom was a prisoner captured the evening before.
A halt was ordered to give the guides time to advance to the front and
take the trail to the ford. I halted myself in view of the river which
was so wide from its overflowing the banks that I took it to be one of
those lakes so frequently found in the swamps of this country. Gen.'
Armstrong advanced with the guides to the head of the spies, and
approached the supposed ford
The guides entered the river. Major Lauderdale a gallant and
veteran soldier was close behind them. Gen' Armstrong, than whom
a braver man never lived was the first person in advance, and at the
waters edge, the two front horses were already swimming, when the
Indians poured in a heavy volley from the opposite side of the river.
Our advance retired fortunately without any loss or injury. The
fire was returned with great spirit by the spies. Gen' Armstrong
rejoined me and reported the river to be at least 200 yards wide—
swimming from bank to bank;—with driftwood passing rapidly down
the current. I immediately ordered all the horsemen to retire from
the swamp, satisfied with the impracticability of swimming the stream
in the presence of the enemy. After reaching the open ground in
the rear, Major Gordon most gallantly volunteered to lead his Bat-
tallion on foot to give a further examination to the river and to en-
gage the enemy
He was authorised to do so and he and his command advanced with
great intrepidity to the bank of the stream, where they received the
fire of the enemy, which was instantly returned and continued until
they were ordered to retire, having silenced the yells, and nearly
the firing of the enemy. As stated in my official report the Gallant
Major Gordon & three of his brave followers were wounded in this
affair. The report of Major Gordon and his officers confirmed the
opinion I had at first formed, that the passage of the river on horse-
back was impossible The next mode of crossing was by the con-
struction of rafts. This was proposed. I have previously said that
I marched from Suwanee Old Towns with no other transportation

than pack horses hence we brought with us no other tools that a few
axes—I called on Major Pierce who informed me that he had no
others than those required by the Pioneers. We had not expected
to meet with such a barrier and was therefore unprepared to overcome
it. To construct rafts to land a sufficient number of men to meet a
formidable body of Indians, would have been the work of some time
with the best preparation. With us it could not have been accom-
plished before the last ounce of provisions in our Camp would have
been consumed. Besides there were no suitable materials to be
found in the neighbourhood for the construction of Rafts. The
pitch pine it is well known will sink almost as soon as lead and the
hard heavy wood of the swamp, except when it is found dead and dry
is but little more favourable I have had more than one occasion in
the south to make the experiment, and know that it will not succeed.
But admitting for the sake of argument that a sufficient number of
rafts of the best material could have been constructed, in one hour
to cross the whole army at a single trip, could its passage have been
effected in the presence of the enemy without great slaughter? A raft
could not have been carried over in less than ten or fifteen minutes,
during which time the men would have been exposed to the deadly
aim of a concealed enemy. It may be said that the rafts might have
been built and the men crossed over at some other point than that
occupied by the enemy, but the falling of the trees and sound of the
axes in procuring materials to construct the raft would soon attract
the attention of a vigilant enemy, and he would be prepared to meet
you wherever you might attempt to cross unless you went to some
distant place. I assure you Sir that the passage of this river at any
point is exceedingly difficult, and almost impossible without boats.
I am aware that the President is of opinion that if we had passed into
the cove, we should have found an abundance of corn, but in this he is
entirely mistaken
I examined the cove in person, and am well convinced that there
could not have been five bushels of corn raised in it, nor was there any
appearance of corn having been brought to it from any other place,
which corroberates the statement of all the prisoners that they made
no corn and were living alone on beef, Even this article was generally
unfit for use and we destroyed hundreds of cattle which our hungry
troops would not use.
Our subsequent difficulties in crossing the river after the water had
fallen 4 feet, proves it to have been impossible at the time the first
attempt was made, as we still found it swimming in some places, and
in all others deep fording, presenting a width of 220 yards, bordered
on both sides with deep Cypress swamps.

I have yet to speak of the stream flowing from the Lake into the
river, which the detatchment of Tennessee Troops under the command
of Lieut: Col: Guild attempted to cross without success on the
13th day of October
This formed another barrier and with the Lake on the north and
the Withlacoochee on the south constituted a defence equaled only
by the cove itself. On our last visit to the Withlacoochee supposing
the passage into the cove would be obstinately defended by the
enemy—the Tennessee Brigade with its usual gallantry claimed the
honour of forcing the passage. It was awarded to them, but while
they were preparing to advance, a report from the friendly Indians
sent to reconnoitre the banks informed me that 4 of their number
had already crossed and could find no recent sign of the enemy. On
receiving this intelligence Gen' Armstrong, Col. Trousdale" and the
other officers present with the same spirit of Chivalry which induced
them to make the request, knowing it was my wish in the first in-
stance that the Regular Troops and Creek Warriors should be sent
into the Cove declined the permission granted them and asked per-
mission to seek a new enterprise at the stream flowing from the Lake
and the Towns beyond it, where Lieut: Col. Guild and his brave
followers had fought so gallantly on the 13" of October. Accord-
ingly the the Tennessee Brigade was ordered to that point, they
approached, in the confident expectation of finding the enemy, there
strongly posted and in large force.
They were disappointed. They found no other impediment to
their march but the stream itself & the swamps and marshes with
which it was bordered on both sides. The water had greatly sub-
sided, but the stream was wide and deep, in some places still swimming,
the banks boggy, and covered with a dense undergrowth.
The report of Gen' Armstrong and all the officers of his Brigade
proves the impossibility of crossing, when the attempt was first made,
on the 13" of October, and sustains the high character of Col: Gill
for his bearing and good conduct on that day. I have already in my
official report of the 27* Ulto. mentioned the destruction of the Towns
beyond this stream, by the Regiment under the command of Col.
Trousdale, accompanied by Major Barrow, the aid of Gen Armstrong,
who gallantly volunteer his services on this occasion. I trust Sir
that the difficulties which presented themselves in the passage of
the river,-the want of means to overcome them, and the necessity
which required that the army should march immediately to a depot
for supplies, shew sufficient and abundant reasons why I did not
cross the river and drive the enemy from his position. When I marched

from the camp opposite the cove my route was down the banks of
the Withlacoochee, merely avoiding its swamps which were impas-
sable. I had as I have shewn a right, confidently to believe, I should
find supplies in a march of 35 or 40 miles. I expected to cross one
half of the army in boats at that point and in a few days march up
on both sides and attack the enemy. The Idea of a “retrograde”
movement had never been conceived by me or any officer of my com-
mand, I thought it best to march this short distance, on the line of
the enemy's barrier to a point where the pressing necessities of the
army could be supplied where a portion of it might be crossed over
the river with its baggage, without difficulty, and from whence the
whole force could arrive at the cove in five days, attack, and route
the enemy. I deemed this more Judicious than to exhaust the last
remnant of our supplies in a fruitless effort to cross the river, which
in our situation was believed to be impossible
Yet this charge of making retrograde movements has been made
by the Department of War, sustained by the high authority of the
President of the U. States, and constitutes the first sentence in the
order to Gen' Jessup, by which I am superceded. All this is done on
“Rumour” & before a “definite judgement has been formed,” of my
conduct. I believe the explanation I have given and the proofs I
am prepared to offer, will not only acquit, but justify me in the opin-
ions of all unprejudiced men. But the Judge who condemns the
prisoner on “rumour” unproved and causes him to be executed be-
fore a “definitive judgement is formed of his guilt, will seldom admit
on any testimony, however conclusive that the unhappy man died
innocent
That I did not meet with supplies on the Withlacoochee, according
to my expectations, I have and still consider one of the greatest
misfortunes, which could have befallen me & has been a source of the
deepest mortification But it was from no fault of mine for I had
prepared all the necesrary means to insure success, and but for the
circumstances which I have mentioned, which could not be antici-
pated by any one the depot would have been established before the
5th of Oct” When however I failed in all these well grounded expec-
tations, what was next to be done? Should the army perish in the
wilderness, or should it march in pursuit of food. I prefered the latter
and it was done.
The several complaints which you have mentioned against me, when
taken collectively, amount to the charge of having made a retrograde
movement before the enemy. This charge will be repelled by the
united voice of the whole army which I have the honor to command,
and I am prepared to meet it in such a manner as will satisfy my
friends and country of the injustice which has been done me. The

apprehensions of the President for the safety of the frontier, supposed
to have been exposed by what you have been pleased to denominate
my “retrograde movements” were entirely unnecessary and must
have arisen from his want of information of my position at Fort
Drane and of the fact that the last scout of the enemy had been de-
stroyed or driven across the Withlacoochee
Since writing the above I have the satisfaction to inform you that
Maj Gen' Jessup has arrived at my Camp and that on this day 4”
De' I shall surrender to him the command of the army in Florida.
Feeling a deep interest in the prompt and successful termination of
this troublesome war, I am highly gratifyed at being relieved in com-
mand by an officer of such distinguished merit. But I owe it to him
as my successor to say that he may and most probably will meet with
embarrassment and delays in the execution of his high trust, which
have not and cannot be anticipated by the Government. He will
find as others have done, that the transportation of supplies into the
interior, even now, when all the depots are established and well
furnished, will be attended with the most serious embarrassment,
and that to keep an army constantly acting against the enemy,
another force of equal size should be employed in constructing and
garrisoning Posts, and in protecting the transport train in its passage.
Believing Sir that I have sustained the deepest injury, and that I
have been visited with the greatest injustice by the orders of the
President, communicated in your letter of the 4* Ult: I must avail
myself of the common priviledge, of demanding an investigation of
my conduct. I have therefore respectfully to request that a Court of
enquiry may be ordered to assemble to enquire into and report,
on all the official improprieties with which I am charged. In making
this request I have no right perhaps to offer a suggestion with regard
to the time or place, when, and where the court should assemble.
But it is a duty I owe myself to inform the Department, that by the
fatigue and exposure I have encountered in the prosecution of this
campaign, during a continued stage of enfeebled health, I have con-
tracted a disease of the lungs, which would cause a visit to the north,
during the winter months, to be attended with the most fatal conse-
quences. It would therefore be to me a matter of vital importance
that some other time or place should be selected.
So soon as I shall have passed this ordeal I shall with great pleasure
tender to the President of the U: States my resignation, as Governor
of the Territory of Florida

SIR I had the honour on the 9" Inst" to inform you of my con-
templated march to the Withlacoochee.
On the evening before my arrival, Col. Randall the Adj* & In-
spector Gen' was ordered with Major Upshaw of the Tennessee
Brigade to advance with the spies under command of Captains
Lauderdale & Wilson, and the front guard under command of Col
Trousdale, and select an encampment about 4 miles from the river.
In the performance of this duty they surprised a party of the enemy,
killed Ten warriors, and captured eleven women & children. But
five of the warriors escaped & several of them were traced for some
distance by the blood. We learned from the prisoners that the
strong hold of the enemy was immediately on the opposite side of
the river, and not more than 4 miles distant, and that one of the
principal negro towns, was about three miles distant, situated be-
tween the Withlacoochee and a stream flowing into it from a large
lake. The next morning I attempted to cross the river but found
it swolen by the heavy rains and out of its banks. The enemy was
in possession of the opposite side and gave us a volley as soon as we
appeared but without effect. Two hundred good marksmen under
the command of Major Gordon was ordered to dismount and take
possession of the bank of the river. This was done with great gallan-
try by all the officers and men engaged, and a partial fire ensued
which continued for some time, when ascertaining the impracticability
of swimming our horses under the fire of the enemy when the river
was near 200 yards wide, I caused the detachment to retire. In this
fire Major Gordon was slightly wounded in the breast, and two of
the privates were wounded, but not dangerously. The loss of the
enemy was not ascertained but supposed to be much greater than
ours. On the same day Lieut: Col Gill of the Tennessee Brigade
was despatched to attack the negro town above described. He was
met at the stream which constitutes the principal barrier of defence,

by a body of negroes and Indians who disputed his passage with
great obstinacy for one hour and a half, when the enemy was driven
from his position, as it is believed with considerable loss. Several
were seen to fall, and one in particular who was seen to fall from a
tree Our loss was three killed. Our faithful Indian guide Billy,
and privates M*Kenley & Dan H. West of the Tennessee Brigade,
and eight wounded, but I am happy to say none of them dangerously.
The stock of our provisions being nearly exhausted we were com-
pelled the next day to march to our supplies, having every confidence
that the depot at the mouth of the Withlacoochee had been estab-
lished, from which we were not more than 30 miles distant. We
marched to that place for relief, but we were unable to penetrate the
country to the mouth of the river and on our arrival at the lowest
practicable point, not hearing anything of the party ordered to es-
tablish the depot, I was compelled most reluctantly to fall back on
this place. But for this disappointment I am confident the war
might have been closed in ten days. As I had expected, Col: Lanes
Regiment was operating near me on the river, and has this morning
united with me. On his arrival at Tampa Bay he had a skirmish
with the enemy, within a few miles of the Fort, in which he defeated
& drove them at all points. The loss of the enemy was not ascer-
tained, that of Col Lane was two Regular soldiers wounded. On his
march to the Withlacoochee he again encountered the enemy in the
Lakes and swamps of the river, In his approach the men were some-
times up to the shoulders in water, and were compelled to carry the
amunition on their Bayonets
With all these disadvantages he continued to advance & routed
the enemy from his strong position. On this occasion he had one
of his warriors wounded. What effect was produced on the enemy
was not ascertained, as they fled so soon as the barrier was passed.
I have ordered the mounted men to fall back on Black Creek to forage
the horses, which have been without grain for more than 20 days.
I shall remain here with Col. Lanes command, and while our horses
are recruiting, will have a large quantity of provisions despatched
here, and from this, shall advance a Post within cannon shot of the
strong hold of the enemy, on the Withlacoochee. This is a place of
great strength from the natural barrier it presents to every approach,
and where I learn from the prisoners, the women and children were
concealed during the last winter & spring. I have despatched an
officer to ascertain the situation of the depot at the mouth of the
Withlacoochee, to enable me to open a communication by land or

It is particularly desirable for our coasting trade being a point, or

SIR, Understanding that you feel an interest in the improvements
of that part of Florida, contiguous to St. Josephs' Bay, and have
perhaps been made acquainted with their wishes in that respect, I
take leave to inform you, that I will present any memorial which
you may choose to offer in their behalf, and I will submit to any com-
mittee of Congress your views in a less formal manner, if you prefer
to communicate them.
I wish it to be distinctly understood that I have not the slightest
feeling of hostility to the prosperity of the Town of St. Joseph, and I
now avow my readiness to prevent [present] and support any measure
just in itself, which you may recommend to promote its interests.
I have already proposed by a resolution of the House, to the com-
mittee on Commerce to establish a port of entry and a lighthouse at
that place"
Feeling myself constrained at the last session of Congress, to resist
the oppressive and unprecedented Legislation which was attempted
to promote that place, to the injury of Appalachicola, Pensacola,
and the whole Territory, the course has been construed, I am

aware with a settled hostility on my part. I have no such feeling.
I am willing to propose and to support an act of Congress, giving
the right to the St. Josephs' company to make a rail road to Ten-
nessee bluff" and to any other point, reserving as has been done in
all other cases, the right to the Territory or state to make a canal
east and west across said route as has been provided, north and south
across the East Florida Rail road, in the bill which passed the Senate
at the last session of which I now enclose you a copy.” To this bill
has been added a clause permitting another company, if they choose
to avail themselves of it, the right to make a road from the Georgia
line, through the richest part of the Territory to the Appalachicola

If you are engaged to represent the Union Rail road company, I
will also present any memorial which you may desire to offer. As
that company will expire by its own limitation in the next month
without the action of Congress. For my views and opinions in regard
to that company I have the honor to enclose you a letter I have
addressed to the people of Florida, to disabuse myself of some of the
misrepresentations in relation to it. *
In regard to these rail road companies, I have only to say, that I
have not a share of stock in either of them, and that my only object
is to promote the general interest of our Territory, in which I shall
be most happy to have your concurrence and support."

THE HONORABLE B. F. BUTLER Secretary of War ad interem
SIR/ In answer to the letter of the Honorable Thomas H. Benton,
Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs,” enclosing a Reso-
lution of the Senate, authorizing the appropriation for repairing the
Sea Wall at St. Augustine to be expended in the reconstruction of
the same,” and requesting the opinion of the department upon this
measure, I have to state that Lieut. Mansfield, of the Corps of Engi-
neers, having the general charge of this work, reports, that the relo-
cation of the Sea Wall in advance is, in his opinion, indispensable; so
crooked and irregular has it been built, and so badly has the work
been executed. It is further stated that the foundation stone of the
old Spanish wall, as well as that in front of the city; inclines several
degrees towards the bay; has neither solidity or symetry to recom-

mend it, and has been undermined in several places and fallen. The
low water line of the bay is in advance of the wall, as it now stands,
varying from 20 to forty yards, and the bay street is only about 15
feet wide. It is proposed to commence the wall from the angle of the
fort; running it in a continuous line to about forty feet in front of
its present position, at the south end, presenting a handsome curve
and widening the bay street of the town.
From the report of Lieut Mansfield it appears it would be a useless
expenditure of money to repair the wall as it now stands, and therefore
it would have to be rebuilt. It is presumed the cost of reconstructing
it in its present condition would not materially differ from the re-
location proposed. The department, however, is without the data
for comparing the expense of the two operations.”
The Resolution of the Senate is returned.

DEAR SIR—I have to request that you will publish the enclosed.
I regret to say that a deep excitement has been produced here by
a Bill introduced into the Legislative Council, not only on account
of its assumption of sovereign National authority but for other causes.
It will prejudice all appropriations to carry on the war, lessen the
simpathy, & interest Felt for the people of Florida, and materially
affect the claims depending here for indemnification.
I have been told fifty times, “since your Legislature has taken up
the subject, & are about to dispose of captures we need not act on the
subject”
Four or five copies of the printed bill have reached here through
some channel, & you will see that the Government Newspaper has

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[February 7, 1837]
Address
To the Honorable, the Senate and house of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled
The Legislative Council of the Territoy of Florida, impressed with
the justice and necessity of an early and immediate action of the
Government of the United States upon the subject of the losses,
sustained by the people of Florida, during the Seminole hostilities,
beg leave most respectfully to address themselves to your honorable
body in behalf of their unfortunate constituents—
In surveying the disastrous effects of the disturbances yet raging
over a district of Country, rich in the advantages of nature, and but
87 White's retirement became effective at the close of the second session of the

lately, smiling with all the abundance and prosperity, which those
advantages procured; they have been struck with the strong Claims
of their fellow Citizens upon the sympathy of their Government;
which a Calm and Careful review of the relation, which this Territory
occupies towards the General Government, of the Causes and origin,
of the war, and of the circumstances that have marked its progress,
has convinced them, of the peculiar propriety with which those
who have suffered, may rest themselves upon its justice for their
remuneration.
It is by no means an admitted or settled principal among the writers
upon public Law that a nation is not bound to indemnify its Citizens
for the ravages of a public enemy. The reason assigned by those
who assume the negative is not such an one as will satisfy a liberal
and enlightened view of political morality; while, on the other hand,
the argument that war being a public act, and as is to be presumed
for Common good, the loss by destruction of property, no less than
the expense, occuring in its prosecution, should be borne in Common
by all the community, ought in this Government of “Equal burdens
and Equal rights to give prevalence to the affirmative proposition:
But be this question held as it may, the nature of the protection due
to the people of Florida is of a character so entirely different, and
so infinitely superior to that which the United States owe to its own
immediate Citizens, as to withdraw them from the influence of prin-
ciples, which, in ordinary Cases, might restrict the action of Goven-
ment. The Citizen who suffers individual injury in his property by
the operations of an Enemy may find some place to silence his murmur
at the denial of reimbursement, in the reflection that as a component
member of the Community, he is directly concerned in the purpose
and prize of the Contest—has mediately or immediately joined in
the Counsels that have given it origin, and Controlled its progress,
duration, and event—and that sharing in its benefits and responsi-
bilities, he must abide its chances; But the people of Florida are
otherwise circumstanced with reference to the United States Govern-
ment. They inhabit the territory of the United States, and are
therefore subject to its disposition, yet participating not in its sov-
reignty are politically separated from its interests. They can give
no voice, exercise no share, in the conduct or diplomacy of the Govern-
ment—They cannot influence the policy of its administration, nor
intrude upon the Councils that direct it—they are denied all part in
the negociations that may result in war, or avert it, in the measures
of precaution that should precede it, or in those of defence that
follow—nor can they claim participation in the fruits of success.
In all respects then, they are directly and completely dependant upon


## p. 369 (#383) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R I TOR Y 369
the United States for Security and protection from its enemies;
And in proportion as this dependence is perfect and unqualified,
the protection that is due them is £#
This claim of unlimited protection might indeed be waived in a
case in which the means and power of the Government were unequal
to the obligation—but when as in this instance, the power of the
United States, as compared with the force of its enemy, may be justly
termed unbounded. Those who have suffered may well be excused
for insisting upon its fulfilment.
In this view of the obligation of the Government and the corelative
right of the people of this Territory, it would be unecessary to do
more than to ascertain the fact of loss, to establish their claims to
indemnification. But without resting here, they may safely advance
yet further in urging the strict rightfulness and peculiar equity of
their claim; for without fear, they may justly insist, than even an
ordinary degree of protection has Not been granted them.
Upon this subject this Legislative Council, though constrained to
candor, speak with reluctance. Identified in sentiment and affection,
in education and prejudice with the Citizens of the States, they
profess themselves in heart one people, tho' politically distinct. Thus
affected, it is not readily or lightly that their consent would be yielded
to the advancement of a Charge, touching most slightly the National
pride. But while a sense of what is due to their unfortunate fellow
citizens, compels them to be unreserved, the exalted point of view
in which it is their pride to regard your honorable Body, emboldens
them to be frank in the communication of their sentiments. They
will be free then to say, that a deliberate and dispassioned considera-
tion of the history of the Seminole hostilities has fixed them in the
opinion that the measures of precaution for the safety of the lives
and property of their fellow citizens, which an ordinary forecast and
prudence would have directed, were wholy neglected;—that this
neglect occured in the face of circumstances, which long before hos-
tilities commenced pointed palply to the danger, and in despite of
the reiterated and timely warning of officers, high in authority; that
for an unreasonable and unjustifiable length of time, after hostilities
commenced, they were left, weak and unprepared as they were, with-
out aid, to depend upon their own resources; and that even after the
attention of Government was fully awakened, and an unsuccessful
campaign had evinced at once the prowess and daring of the enemy,
and the dangers to which the lives and property of the inhabitants
must continue to be exposed, they were abandoned and left without
the necessary defence, during a great part of the Spring and Summer
of the past year. In a communication of this description a detail

of facts may well not well be indulged in, but the mention of one
circumstance alone will tend to illustrate the justice of the preceding
conclusions. They allude to the fact that immediately upon com-
mencement of hostilities, the only company of United States Soldiery
at St Augustine was withdrawn from that place, and the whole district
of Country east of the St Johns remained without the presence of a
single United States Soldier for nearly two months after, during
which time, was enacted most of the ruinous desolation of which that
portion of East Florida was destined to be the scene.
If this people then, may urge that not only has full and complete
protection, not been extended, but that even an ordinary degree of
protection was not vouchsafed them, the establishment of the justice
of their claim, it is thought, admit of much hesitancy—
If any thing now wanting to strengthen the Case, which those who
have suffered might present, it may well be found, in the fact, that
the contest has been for soil, not for sovereignty—for property and
possession, upon a question of barter between the United States and
the Indians, and therefore wholy of Federal interest; and is especially
one in which the interest and rights of the people of Florida were in
no wise concerned. It would be most cruel then, that all the dis-
asters and burdens, which the dispute has originated should be per-
mitted to fall without redress upon their heads. In an other sub-
stantive point of view, it is thought that the right of indemnification
is susceptible of support independantly of every other ground. The
Indians inhabit the Territory of the United States and are subject
thereby to its sovreignty. They have by the treaty of Camp Moul-
trie submitted to the protection of the United States, and placed
themselves under its patronage. The United States by the same
treaty assumed their guardianship. It is submitted whether the
relations growing out of this state of things between the United States
Government, and the Indians, do not result in rendering the United
States directly answerable for the trespasses and violences of their
political wards, the Indians—while the latter are doubtless responsible
over to the United States for the Consequences of this liability—
With great respect to your honorable Body this Legislative Council
take leave to suggest, in addition to the immediate purpose of this
address, the propriety of adopting early measures to secure to the
United States a reimbursement of the amount which the just in-
demnification of those whose property has been devastated, may
require, according to the well established usages of nations and the
settled rule of public Law, it is undeniable, that viewing the Indians
as the wagers of an unjust war, the United States have the right to
cease and appropriate all that is necessary to reimburse the expenses,
and indemnify the ravages, which the war has produced. The per-

sonal property of the Seminoles which must fall by Capture, or by
their submission into the power of the United States—the large
sums of money, stipulated to be paid them in the treaty, the execu-
tion of which is sought to be enforced—and if need be, even a portion
of the Territory which they acquire in exchange of the Lands they
resign in Florida, will afford ample sources for complete reimburse-
ment; And as these means will be fully, and are exclusively, within
the reach and power of the Federal Government, whether availed
of or neglected, the right of the people of Florida to look to that
Government for the adjustment and satisfaction of their claims,
Cannot, it is submitted, be avoided—
Before concluding this House beg leave to urge upon your Honorable
Body the necessity of an early action upon the subject of this address.
The Country has been laid in ruins; its best improvements have been
swept from its face; the inhabitants, many of them growing in their
gradual rise to competence and comfort, are reduced to beggary; the
improvements and settlements that before existed can never be re-
newed by the same people, until the recompence of their losses shall
have been realized. In addition to this, innumerable families have
been dispoiled of their head by the mischances of the war, and by the
ravages of the pestilence it has produced, is that hapless widdows and
beggared orphans in pitiable numbers, depend upon this resource for
their relief. Every consideration of justice, of policy, and of charity
even, unite in requiring a prompt consideration of the subject. Delay
of justice to the sufferers will be the highest injustice, and will operate
to the great detriment of the country, by preventing its speedy revival,
when hostilities shall have ceased.”

ing the survey of “Forbes Purchase,” particularly that part which is
required by your department of making out exact returns, shewing
the very many indentations on all the lines, also the exact area of all
the purchases (say form) can be the only excuse I have in my power
to offer for the long delay of handing in the returns. I have been at
work night and day for some time past at my brother's, in making
the drawings of the survey, is the cause why your letter did not
sooner reach me. and receive that attention which was incumbent
on me to bestow on it.
You have been pleased Sir, to remark that—the unusual delay
in filling said contract in all its provisions &c &c. In answer to which
I have only to say that the difficulty of procuring the necessary as-
sistants and also the long spell of sickness which I was afflicted with
last summer will possibly be a sufficient apology for the delay It is
only the person who performs the drudgery, who knows or who can
at all possibly appreciate the difficulties which I have had to encounter
in the late survey. I was not aware myself, Sir, that more and

DELEGATE WHITE TO J. KNOWLES
[LC:Pensacola Gazette, Mar. 18, 1837]
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15, 1837.
DEAR SIR: Having written three letters to the Secretary of War
on the subject, I called to-day in person to see the President, to pro-
test against any further draft on Middle Florida, and to suggest that
they would have enough to do to protect their own frontiers. He
declared he did not believe that Jesup had made any draft or a call
for one; wanted evidence of the fact; denied that Florida, had ever
had a Brigadier General's command in the field, and then becoming
excited, he said “Let the damned cowards defend their country,”
that he could take fifty women, and whip every Indian that had ever
crossed the Suwannee, and that the people of Florida had done less
to put down the war, or to defend themselves than any other people
in the United States. He said they ought to have crushed it at once,
if they had been men of spirit and character. He said if five Indians
had approached into the white settlements of Tennessee and Kentucky
not one would have ever got out alive. He said the men had better
run off or let the Indians shoot them, that the women might get
husbands of courage, and breed up men who would defend the country.
He maintains that there never was 600 Indians.
When he had finished his harrangue, which, of course, was not
very agreeable to me, I said to him, your Army and all your Generals,
have been in the field, why have they not conquered these 600 In-
dians? and why are the people of Florida thus reproached for not
doing what all your regular troops, and Tennesseeans, have failed
to accomplish?
I told him, the Tennesseeans at Wahoo, as I was informed, had
some difficulty to get their wounded off the field. Said he, “it is
a lie!!” I answered I was not there, and did not state it on my
personal knowledge. He then said if they had not got out of pro-
visions, what they would have done. I told him they always got
out of provisions, and were hungry in sight of the enemy.
We came to no understanding. He required proof that Jesup had
called for men, and I cut out of the newspaper the Report of the

Several Mickasukey Indians have come to camp to-day—Mic-
conopy has heard from the Chief of that band, Abi-a-ca (Sam Jones),
also from Oseola (Powell). Those Chiefs are both between Apopka
& the St. Johns; and Micconopy and Aligator have no doubt of bring-
ing them in early next month, perhaps sooner—
I now for the first time have allowed myself to believe the War at
an end. The same errors, however, that renewed the War in Alabama
would renew it here; I mean the imprudent violence of the Citizens.
Should they attempt to seize any of the Indians either as criminals
or as debtors the scenes of the last year will be renewed. If it should
become necessary to protect them from such annoyance, I shall not
hesitate to declare Martial law, and send every individual not con-
nected with the public service out of the Country—
I now hold the troops in such a position as to produce the best
military effect. I can operate in any direction from this point and
never be more than from thirty five to fifty miles from a depôt.
Should the Indians not act in good faith, I shall be able to attack
them on either side of me in from three to five days—with mounted
men in much less time.
I enclose a copy of the Instrument signed by Micconopy, con-
firming what had been done by the Chiefs who represented him and
the Nation.
Micconopy informed me last night that he had never before con-
sented to emigrate; but that he now believed the great Spirit had so
ordered, that he should leave the land of his fathers, and he submitted
cheerfully.
I shall discharge in a few days a Battalion of Alabama Drafts.
They were called into service when our prospects were most gloomy;
but they have rendered no other service than to aid in protecting the
train between Tampa and the several interior depôts: they brought
the measels with them, and have in consequence been entirely in-
efficient.

R BUTLER Esq S. G. Tallahassee Florida
SIR; I have the pleasure to inform you if not already apprized of
the fact through the public prints, that Congress under the head of
unfinished surveys of portions of townships, islands, lakes &c have
appropriated the sum of $6000 for your surveying district to be ex-
pended at a rate not exceeding $5 per mile "being the amount esti-
mated in your last annual report " for “surveying public lands on
the Suwanee and Appalachacola rivers, and adjacent islands, with
some scrap surveying believed to be valuable, and all of difficult
execution, (a) 5$ per mile.”
This appropriation being specific in its nature, and having been
made with the understanding that it would only be applied to the
survey of such tracts as should be previously reported to this office
by the Surveyor General, before instructions can be issued to author-
ize the surveys it will be necessary to forward a particular list of the
lands to be surveyed, (designated by township and range) as per
instructions of my predecessor of the 1st of September last, which
you will please furnish at your earliest convenience, in order that
there may be no time lost in closing the surveys. I will also embrace
the present as a proper occasion, to caution you against making
hereafter, a final settlement with any deputy for surveying, until
it shall be first ascertained to your satisfaction that he has fulfilled
the extent of his contract and has left no minute unsurveyed frac-
tions, which if allowed, under the additional inducements now offered
for leaving such tracts, would defeat the object of the appropriation
by increasing rather than diminishing their number. With the fullest
confidence in your vigilence for the public interest and that proper
attention will not be wanting on your part to prevent such conse-
quences
I am &c

I have found it necessary to order M. Goldsborough again to the

with the survey of Forbes & Co as required in his instructions, (Wide
copy on file with contract in your Office) which he failed to comply
with, and which fact came but recently to my knowledge, and although
minutes of the surveys supposed to have connection were furnished
him from this Office to facilitate his progress.
Will you have the goodness to advise me whether the expression
used in your circular, the “Office to be kept open for the transaction
of business” &c, means only the number of hours daily that business
is to be transacted in it, or that the doors are to be kept open during
business hours. If the latter idea is also embraced, I would respect-
fully suggest, that we are from necessity in this climate compelled
to keep our doors and windows closed during the hours of business,
to prevent the winds from driving our papers to & fro, and in the

THOMAS S. JESUP TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR
[NA:OIA, Lets. Recd., Fla. Emig.:LS]
Head Quarters, Army of the South TAMPA BAY, April 9" 1837
Sir, I had the honor to receive, yesterday, your two letters of the
20th ultimo.*
The War, I hope is over: at all events there is but little danger of
a renewal of hostilities, if the Troops be held in readiness for immed-
iate action, and the inhabitants of Florida act with ordinary prudence.
Should, however, any attempt be made to seize the Indian negroes,
or to arrest any of the Chiefs or Warriors, either as criminals or debtors,
an immediate resort to arms would be the consequence.
Several of the principal Chiefs are in this neighbourhood with
detachments of their people—Micconopy, Holatoochee, Yaholoochee,
(Cloud) Coaco-chee, (Wildcat), John Ca-wi-ya and several sub
chiefs and Warriors, left me yesterday for the emigrating camp.
Co-a-co-chee is the son of Philip, the principal Chief on the St. Johns
river: his influence is greater than that of his father—He is decidedly
the most talented man I have seen among the Seminoles, and should,
and no doubt will, be the principal Chief of the Nation—He promises
that Abiacca, the Chief of the Mickasukies with his people shall

come in He returns to the St. Johns to collect his cattle, and will
start his father and all his people, immediately to the emigrating
camp—
The Chiefs entered into an engagement yesterday to surrender
the negroes taken during the War. They will deliver them to the
commanding Officers of the Posts on the St. Johns.
The Indians generally will emigrate; but the measure will be tedious,
and in all its preliminary steps, expensive—A few thousand dollars
judiciously applied as a compensation to the Chiefs of energy and
influence, would save in the end, and I am persuaded, fifty times the
amount thus expended—
When the emigration of the greater part of the Nation shall have
been effected, strolling vagabonds will remain, probably, and annoy
the frontier inhabitants—To restrain them I propose to re-establish
Fort King, and establish a post between Fort Drane & the Suwannee.
Fort Drane being in a very unhealthy section of the Country, its
Garrison must be withdrawn early in June.
One or two posts, with small garrisons, may probably be required
on the Atlantic Coast, south of St. Augustine—
The garrisons of Forts Mellon * & Call must be withdrawn by the
1st of June, in consequence of the unhealthiness of the sites of those
forts—
In regard to the topographical information which you require of
me, it becomes my duty to report to you that although two officers
of the Topographical Corps had been assigned to my command by
orders published to the Army, & both actually reported to me, one
was withdrawn without entering upon duty & the other a few days
after he joined me. I have therefore, but few materials for a topo-
graphical scetch and memoir of the Country which has been the
scene of my operations.
I came hither without any knowledge of the Country—and there
were no guides to be obtained on whose information any reliance
could be placed. The only guides from whom correct information
has been obtained are Indians and negroes whom I captured—
We have possessed Florida sixteen years—During the whole of
that period we have had a Topographical Corps on the Register, and
borne on the Army returns; but the officers have been taken from
their appropriate duties and employed upon those purely civil; the
consequence is, that we have perhaps as little knowledge of the
interior of Florida, as of the interior of China—
I have directed my Aid de Camp, Lieut. Linnard, to collect and
arrange such data as are accessible, with a view of making as com-

and the Bay of S" Andrews. The Townships which I consider as
important to be completed under the appropriation refered to I
have designated thus (Bay") and all the Islands with such other
Townships as you may deem important from their relative situation.
Contracts cannot be entered into for any part of this work South &
east until assurances are had, that all danger from the Indians shall
have been removed. The work bordering on the Appalachicola and
west to include the 10" Range can be made the ground work of one
Contract and part thereof executed this summer, the residue next
fall and winter (some of it is now under water.)
The residue west is not important, except a private claim con-
firmed to M. De. La. Carera (page 211a. of Laws 1846)," and of which
no data can be found on the files of this Office to give it a location,
although diligently sought after. Information on this subject is
solicited.
In reply to your polite and friendly caution on the subject of
making final settlements with Deputy Surveyors, unless certain
fulfilment of their contracts were made manifest to the Surveyor
General, I would beg leave to state that under the instructions,
General & special from this Office, no part of a Township is to be left
unfinished, although its survey may overrun the amount of Contract
unless certified on the face of said Township plat under his Oath of
Office that it was impracticable. I hope this precaution will be
deemed sufficient by you.

and dispatching Deputy Surveyors to their work as early in the

SIR, I have the honor to inclose a copy of a dispatch just received
from Lt. Colonel Harney" who commands at Fort Mellon on Lake
Monroe. The great body of the Seminole Nation are concentrated
in that part of the Country—Powell will be highly useful in bringing
the Indians in, and in hastening their embarkation”—Nothing is
now to be apprehended unless it be the imprudence of Citizens of
Florida—The officious interference of some of them has already
embarrassed the service; and from the public papers I discover that
certain citizens of Florida, who, I presume were unwilling to trust
their persons nearer to the Seminoles than Charleston, are denouncing
me and my measures. I have only to say in reply to them that I
can have no agency in converting the Army into negro catchers,
particularly for the benefit of those who are evidently afraid to under-
take the recapture of their property themselves—
Micconopy, Jumper & Cloud are here with a part of their people—
Holatoochee is collecting his people and will be in by the 20th—
Aligator's people were assembled, but dispersed in consequence of a
report that they were to be executed so soon as they should place
themselves in our power. They are re-assembling—

I have received your letter of the 9th inst,” informing me that
notwithstanding the stoppage of the Union Bank of Florida, the
40 John Pope DuVal, a brother of William Pope DuVal, the former governor
of the territory, was a native of Richmond, Va., and a veteran of the War of
1812 who had emigrated to Florida from Kentucky soon after the cession. In
1837 he was practicing law, apparently at Tallahassee, and was the owner of sugar
lands on the Gulf (DuVal to John Campbell, Apr. 29, 1837, NA, SD, Applica-
tions). Recommendations on his behalf came from his brother, and from Robert
Butler, various members of the Legislative Council, Judges Randall, Webb, and
Cameron, Governor Call and others (loc. cit.). Col. William J. Mills, a native
of the territory and then a resident of Jacksonville, was recommended to the
President by James D. Westcott, Jr., Apr. 5, 1837 (loc. cit.).
* The commission was sent to DuVal on May 17, 1837 (NA, SD, Dom. Lets.

his commission and his salary was paid from the same day (NA, GAO, Misc.

SIR: I have received your letter of the 8th. inst: * and have read
with interest the copy of Colonel Harney's dispatch enclosed by you.
In order that the present gratifying prospect of a speedy termina-
tion of the difficulties in Florida may not be marred, the department
advises that you continue to exercise great vigilence in protecting
the Indians from all violence both from the troops and the citizens,
and that you take all proper measures to prevent any officious inter-
ference from any quarter, with your operations.
The attacks upon your course of conduct, to which you allude, are
not worthy of your notice, and it is hoped that you will steadily
proceed in the execution of your important duties without regard to
them; and rely upon the support of the people and approbation of the
Department, to sustain you in your efforts to put an end to the war
and to send the Indians, speedily and peaceably, to their new homes.”

TALLAHASSEE June 3" 1837
SIR, I have just been informed of the appointment of Mr J. P.
Duval to the office of Secretary of this Territory." Being one of
those who recommended M” Duval for this appointment, I feel it a
duty which I owe equally to the Territory, and to myself to repre-
sent his conduct to the Department, and to ask such interposition
of the authority of the President in relation to him, as may be deemed
proper. In January last the ill health of Mr Walker the late Secre-
tary and my own, was such as to induce a belief that we should both
be compelled to travel during the summer, and he determined to

resign his office, in order that a successor might be appointed who
would remain in the Territory and Administer the Government
during my intended absence. He made known his views to M*
Duval, who was desirous of obtaining the office, and united with
myself and others in recommending him (M” Duval) for the Ap-
pointment. M' Walker then tendered his resignation to take effect
on the 15" of May, last;" In the latter part of April Mr Walker
was informed of the intention of M" Duval to leave the Territory,
he called on him on the first of May and told him if such was his
intention, he would immediately with-draw his resignation. M"
Duval replied that there was no certainty of his appointment, but
that he would continue here until it was ascertained, and if appointed
would remain; This assurance satisfied M. Walker so entirely, with
regard to the proper motives of M" Duval, that instead of with
drawing his resignation as he intended, he addressed an other letter
to the President on the 1* of May urging the appointment of Mr
Duval and requesting that it might be forwarded to this place by the
15 Ulto * During all this time it now appears that M. Duval was
making his arrangements to leave Florida, and on the 15" of May
the very day on which he expected to be appointed Secretary he took
his departure. Being informed of his intention, M Walker called
on him to redeem his pledge but he coolly replied that it was im-
possible, and that day lef the Territory, no doubt to avoid meeting
his appointment here, and to enable him to spend the summer and
enjoy his salary abroad. I understand his intended route was from
this to Savannah, thence to Philadelphia, Pittsburge, and Bards
Town Kentucky. He is travelling with his family and it will be
mid-Summer probably before he will reach the latter place, and he
has not in my opinion the most distant intention of returning to
Florida until the fall: * The deliberate and premeditated bad faith
with which M” Duval has acted throughout this transaction, is such
as to forfeit all claim to my confidence, and I have respectfully to
request that he may be ordered forthwith to return to the Territory,
(if the department can find out where he is) or that his appointment
may be vacat[ed] and M Walker reinstated in his office. Mr Walker
was one of the most efficient, and the most highly esteemed officer
of the Territory, and his reappointment would give universal satis-
faction. As the object which induced him to resign has been entirely
defeated by the bad faith of M* Duval, I hope the latter Gentleman
will not be permitted to enjoy advantages, which he has acquired
by deception.

SIR, I have received your letter of the 5" ultimo,” and I have now
to acquaint you with the entire failure of the scheme of emigration.
Miacanopy Jumper and Cloud, with their families, were seized and
carried off by a party of Warriors on the night of the 2" inst. It is
stated that the Warriors have degraded Micconopy, and have placed
Sam Jones, the Micasuky Chief at the head of the Nation. I believe
the emigration of the Seminoles to be impracticable under any
circumstances—Those who removed last year were upper Creeks,
not Seminoles. The country can be rid of them only by exterminating
them.
I have sent a few Indian and Negro prisoners to New Orleans; and
I shall immediately discharge the vessels which had been employed
to carry the Indians off, and shall deposite to the credit of the Treas-
urer of the U States, the sums placed to my credit in the Branch of
the Bank of Alabama at Mobile, and the Union Bank of Louisianna
at New Orleans.”

SIR, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Comm” of the
20th of April.” transmitting as requested in mine of the 27th of March
last" a list of the unfinished surveys in your district west of the
Suwannee River having designated by this mark Bay" placed opposite
thereto those townships the survey of which you now recommend
to be completed under the appropriation of the present year ($6000)
for surveying in your District at augmented prices not to exceed
$5 per mile
Your list has been placed on file with your last annual report which
it should have accompanied and you are hereby authorised to con-
tract for such portion as the appropriation will pay for of the town-
ships therein recommended for survey and designated as above, at a
rate not exceeding $5 per mile—You will be particular to insert in
these contracts duplicates of which you will forward to this Office,
as usual each particular township and Range contracted for, which
latter direction I will here take occasion to remark and I wish you to
bear it in mind, is intended, where practicable, to apply to all future
contracts for surveying which may be made by you that is, the number
and range of each township of frac'Tp to be surveyed, is to be inserted
in the body of the contract and not as heretofore, merely the aggregate
number of miles, thus giving a latitude to the Deputy to choose his
ground, not in all cases exactly consistent with the pecuniary interests

of the Government, since it enables him to exclude the Townships
which are difficult of survey and which afterwards cannot be surveyed
except at augmented prices—You will also render separate accounts
and vouchers for these surveys and endorse the latter as well as the
contracts “for surveys at augmented prices” in order to prevent
confusion in the settlement of your accounts and for a similar reason
you will distinguish the requisitions which you shall make under
this appropriation for surveys at augmented prices
In reply to your request to be informed what amount of the general
appropriation for surveying will be apportioned to your District in
order that you may be enabled to send your Deputies to the field
early in the autumn and immediately after the removal of the Indians
I have to state that before any instructions can be given authorising
new surveys for which it appears the sum of $10,000 was estimated
in your last annual report it is necessary that you should first report
to this Office, showing the portions of your Dist upon which the afore-
said estimate was based, and which you would now recommend for
survey to be selected with a view to the public interest the demand
and the accommodation of the actual settlers having proper regard to
the clerical force in your office to make the necessary examinations
and protractions and to complete the returns thereof to this office
as well as to the Registers without unreasonable delay. You will
likewise in order to render your report perfectly intelligable accom-
pany it with a connected diagram upon which you will designate
the proposed new surveys by appropriate colors and if approved
you will then be authorised to contract for the same according to the
present practice of this office
In connection with this subject you will also state such facts as
may have come to your knowledge concerning the marks upon the
field, of the former surveys within that portion of your District which
has been of late the seat of the Indian War and which may require
the action of this Office or of Congress at its ensuing session to re-
place such of them as may have been wantonly obliterated by the
savages—And since it appears from the daily prints that the removal
of the Indians is yet only in progress you will give information if in
your power of the probable time that you will be enabled to send
your deputies to the field for the purpose of resuming surveying
operations.
As regards the unexpended balances of former appropriations for
copying field notes I have to inform you that they are available only
if not carried to the surplus fund to prevent which it is necessary
that they should be drawn out before the expiration of two years

necessary to send an experienced Surveyor with two or three hands
to examine the surveys near the Indian Boundarys with powers to
renew land marks, and for which purpose provision ought to be made
by Congress for a reasonable compensation whilst so engaged. Ap-
prenhensions seem to pervade the Community that Indian hostilities
will be again renewed, in which event our chains must rust for the
want of use, until our worthy Red Brethren permit us to walk abroad.
I have received the Treasury Draft required by you to be sent me,
and from the tenor of your letter on the subject of appropriations for
Copying Field notes for your office, I would respectfully request that a
Draft may be sent me for the sum of Two thousand five hundred
Dollars after the last day of September next, which amount will in
all probability complete the copying of all the field notes in the
office. I hope you will approve of the manner of disbursements
suggested in my letter of 12" ins' " by the mile,” as affording a
more correct and equitable mode than any other I could propose.
I shall with pleasure strictly conform to your instructions to have
each contract contain the T" and R* to be surveyed by each Deputy.
Previous to the completion of the Contract for Surveys “at augmented
prices”, I will request such a sum under that appropriation as may
be demanded not wishing to have at any time, or long at a time,
more public monies in my possession than the current expences of
this Office requires.

402 T E R R H TO RIA L PA PERS
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY
[NA:TD, ST, Lets. from Exec. Officers:LS]
ATTORNEY GENERALs Office June 30th 1837.
SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 13" instant,”
in which, after enclosing for my consideration several papers relative
to the claim of Judge Randall, for arrears of compensation, as Judge
of the middle District of Florida, under the act of the 23" of May
1828," you ask my opinion on the questions whether “under the cir-
cumstances of the case Judge Randall is entitled, whilst the cases
referred to are pending in his District, to the extra compensation
provided by the act of the 23" of May 1828; and whether it is com-
petent for this Department, after what has occured, to pay him with-
out further legislation?”
In my opinion, Judge Randall, so long as he has been actually
employed in the discharge of the special duties imposed by the act
of 1828, is equitably entitled to the extra compensation given by it;
and I think it competent for the Department, without further legis-
lation to pay him what it may find to be justly due for fer such
special duties.
The sixth section of the act of the 23" of May 1828 imposed on the
Judges of the Superior Court of Florida, the special duty of receiving
and adjudicating certain claims to land within their respective
districts; and the seventh section contains the following enactment:
“the said Judges shall each be entitled to receive the compensation
given to the District Judge of Missouri, for the performance of the
duties required by this act, out of any money in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated.”
The thirteenth section of the act of the 26" of May 1824,” thus
referred to provides “that the District Judge for the State of Missouri,
shall, while in the discharge of the duties imposed by this act, be al-
lowed at the rate of eight hundred dollars per annum in addition to
his salary as District Judge for the State of Missouri, which shall be
in full for his services.”
The act of May 26* 1824 contains no appropriation of money to
pay the extra allowance given by it to the Missouri Judge; and
consequently it became necessary for Congress afterwards to make
such appropriation, which was done, from year to year, as in ordinary
cases; but the seventh section of the act of the 23" of May 1828

and Bureaus, Bk. 1).

clearly contains a standing, indefinate appropriation of the money
necessary to pay this allowance, enduring so long as the Judges, or
any of them, shall continue to discharge the special duties imposed
by the law; and therefore no additional appropriation was necessary
from year to year. That Congress had the power to make such
an appropriation, if they thought proper, is undeniable. It is not
frequently done in cases of public officers; but the pension laws and
some other acts now in force contain such appropriations under which
moneys, to a very large amount, are annually paid out of the
Treasury.
The only difficulty in the case, and by which it is distinguished
from other cases of standing appropriations, arises from the fact,
that in the year 1829, the first year after the imposing of the duty,
a clause was introduced and passed in the general appropriation law
for the service of that year, making an appropriation for compensation
to the Governor, Judges and Secretary of the Florida Territory,
“including additional compensation to the Judges under the act of
the 23" of May 1828;” and that clauses including the special com-
pensation of the Judges were inserted in the appropriation laws of
each year (except 1830 when the sum appears to have been granted,
but without the special clause above quoted)” and until 1834,” and
offered in subsequent years but stricken out in the House of Repre-
sentatives. The motion to strike out, appears in some instance at
least, to have been made by the Honorable C. Johnson under a belief
on his part, that the special compensation should no longer be paid.
It now appears, however, that the amount of special compensation
given by the act of May 23" 1828 was unnecessarily included in the
act of 1829 and the subsequent laws; and I cannot perceive how the
allowing of it by Congress for a series of years, or the refusal to allow
in 1834, or since, can affect the justice or validity of the claim of the
Judges under the act of 1828. No doubt it was competent for Congress
to repeal the appropriation clause of the act; as to all services to be
performed after the repealing act; but there has been as yet no repeal
of that clause, unless the unnecessary appropriation of the amount
in 1829, and afterwards, can be considered as an implied repeal.
But repeals by implication are never allowed, except when necessarily
involved in the new law, which is not the case here.
I lay out of view, entirely, the particular motives which induced
M" Johnson to submit the motion to strike out the clause; for it is
-* Mar. 2, 1829, 4 STAT. 342.
* Act approved Mar. 11, 1830, 4 STAT. 380.
* Acts approved Mar. 2, 1831 (4 STAT. 457), May 5, 1832 (4 STAT. 511), Mar.
2, 1833 (4 STAT. 624), June 27, 1834 (4 STAT. 695).


## p. 404 (#418) ############################################

404 T E R R ITO RIA L PA P E R S
impossible to ascertain, with certainly, whether or not the other
members of the House of Representatives concurred in those motives;
and under such circumstances, the presumption of law, is, that the
clause was stricken out, because found to be unnecessary; the case
being provided for by the standing appropriation in the act of 1828.
And even if the other members of the House actually concurred in
the views of M. Johnson, the legal character of the case would not
be altered; because the opinions or wishes of one branch of the Legis-
lature cannot have the legal operation of a repealing law, nor affect
legal rights acquired under the former law.
In the foregoing view of the case I have strictly confined myself
to the equitable rights of Judge Randall supposing him to have per-
formed the services since 1833, and to the power of the Department
under the act of 1828; without touching the question, whether, after
what has occurred, it may not be discreet to withold payment until
the direction of Congress can be taken in the matter—that being a
question with which this office has no concern. It is also proper to
mention, that should Judge Randall receive the extra compensation
given by the act of the 23" of May 1828, he must relinquish, for the
time being, the increased salary allowed by the act of the 30” of
June 1834.”

Confirmed to Ten thousand Acres, on Trout Creek,” and to the Four

necessary for you to Cause to be transmitted to this Office Certified
Copies of the said “several surveys as returned with the record,”

Those Copies will then be transmitted from this Office to the Sur-

Should it be found, on surveying the tracts claimed by you, that
any portion of them is held under previous Confirmations, or other

from the Consideration I have given the Case, that this Office Cannot
direct the quantity of acres, within the limits of your tracts, that
may be interfered with by other Claims, to be selected elsewhere for

fires made by the indians all around us have caused to the inhabitants
very serious alarm and constant apprehension of danger and con-
vinced us that nothing but the utmost vigilence on our part will
ensure us safety. The peculiar Situation of Indian Key renders it
liable to incursions from these hostile savages more than any other
location on the coast; the temptation too is considerable inasmuch
as a large store is kept on the key which is at all times filled with
provissions and munitions of war for the use of the inhabitants and
wreckers engaged on the coast, and these facts are well known to the
Indians, they having previous to the breaking out of hostilities been
in the habit of trading at this store.
Your petitioners would further shew that it has already cost the
inhabitants of the Island and those interested therein upwards of
$9000 in protecting their families & property which expense falls
heavily upon them and ought not to be borne by them. Unless
some assistance is rendered them by the government to whom they
pay burthensome taxes for steh protection, they fear all their per-
sonal efforts will prove unavailing.
Your petitioners therefore pray that your honor will order a cutter
properly manned to be stationed at or near Indian Key which will
at the same time be a protection to Key West and the numerous
wrecking vessels on the Coast."

SIR: I have the honor to request that you will, as the agent of this
office, perform a special duty in connection with the Appalachicola
Indians.
Enclosed I transmit copies and extracts of various letters and
papers,” from which it will appear that several outrages have lately
been perpetuated on these Indians by white people. The informa-
tion in possession of the office is not, however, sufficiently full and
explicit to enable it to judge of the proper method of interfering, or
of endeavoring to procure redress for them, or of the propriety and
legality of taking any measure at all on the subject.
* A native of Virginia, Downing emigrated to Florida upon his appointment
as register of the St. Augustine land office in 1826 (ante, XXIII, 594). He
served in that office until 1837, maintaining a law practice on the side. In
politics he became a Whig and served in several sessions of the Legislative Coun-
cil. As Delegate he served until 1841 and a notice of his death appears in the
Fla. Herald, St. Augustine, Oct. 29, 1841.
* The referendum on the question of statehood was in accordance with an
act of the Legislative Council adopted Feb. 12, 1837 (Fla. Terr., Acts, 1837,
pp. 49–50). Though both East Florida and West Florida were opposed to state-
hood, the voters of Middle Florida and especially of the towns of Apalachicola
and St. Joseph provided a majority favoring the end of territorial status. The
results are tabulated in Dodd (ed.), Fla. Becomes a State, pp. 109–112. See also
ibid., pp. 35–38, 441–442. The tabulation was also published, together with the

I have to request that you will proceed to the residence of these
Indians and make a complete investigation of their complaints, and
report all the facts and circumstances you can elicit, and your opinion
as to what, if any thing, should be done in the premises. It is ob-

directed, or in what manner you shall conduct them. All this is left
to yourself, with the single remark that it is desirable that the infor-

While there I will thank you also to make enquiries as to whether
it is probable these Indians would be willing now to dispose of their
reservations and join their kindred west of the Mississippi. The
enclosed copies of the treaties which have relation to these bands,
together with the letter from this office of the 29th. March last will
put you in possession of the necessary information respecting their
rights, interests and claims. Should there be a probability of success,
the proper steps will be taken to effect an object so desirable to them
and to the United States.
A. Smith Jr. acting agent for the Appalachicolas will be notified
of your appointment, and directed to co-operate with you, and I
advise that you seek an interview with him at once.
A reasonable compensation for the services herein indicated will
be made you, and any expenses you may find it necessary to incur
in procuring testimony, hiring interpreters or for other proper objects
connected with the business, will be re-imbursed.
I will thank you to notify me at the earliest practicable moment of
your acceptance or non-acceptance of this appointment. In the event
of acceptance, you will be pleased to enter upon and complete the
duties assigned you as soon as possible."

THE SECRETARY OF WAR. To THOMAs s. JESUP
[NA:WD, SW Lets. Sent, Mil. Bk. 1710]
August 3" 1837.
MAJOR GEN THOMAS S JESUP Gareys ferry. Florida.
SIR, The attention of the department has been called to the sub-
ject of the aid afforded by Government to the suffering inhabitants
of Florida by a late letter received by the Quarter Master General,
from Lieutenant Vinton, informing him that another Steam boat
has been employed to transport subsistence on the requisition of
Governor Call, who alleges that the one now on that service (the
Izard) is not sufficient to supply the suffering inhabitants assembled
at S*Marks. You were informed by a letter of May the 17*.* that
the President had resolved to continue the distribution of rations
to the inhabitants who were unable to maintain themselves until
the 1* of October next, and by that intimation it was intended to
convey his intention that these supplies should cease at that time.
The object of Congress would appear to have been to succour the
immediate wants of a people, who had been suddently driven from
their homes and deprived of the means of supporting themselves,
not to continue during the whole war to maintain them gratuitously,
thereby withdrawing all motive for exertion on the part of those who
might otherwise find means to maintain themselves—Cases may
present themselves of the aged and infirm, the widow and the orphan
wherein you may be called upon to exercise a sound discretion as you
are hereby authorized to do; but on the 1" of October, the present
system of dealing out rations to the suffering inhabitants of Florida
generally as now practised, must cease—And as early notice as pos-
sible ought to be given of this determination of the President.
That none may suffer under this decision, you will give employment
to those who are in want of it, and it is supposed that the various
branches of the service, especially the establishment of stores, Posts

continuance of such a system, the success of the campaign will be

transportation intended for the service of the Army, may be called
off at any time from their legitimate and necessary uses, to convey
these supplies, the commanding General cannot be certain of receiving

rations heretofore distributed to the inhabitants, the commissary's
department cannot answer for the result. The supply must either
way far exceed the regular demand, which is attended as experience
proves, with great waste of the public stores, or there may be a
deficiency of supplies for the troops, to the utter destruction of the
best combined operations. Even those rations which, in the use of a
sound discretion you may find it absolutely necessary to distribute,
ought to be taken from other resources than those intended for the
use of the Army, and transported by other means than those at the
disposition of the Quarter Masters department for the transportation
of the baggage and stores of the Army.
You will therefore cause all such persons to be assembled in the
neighborhood of Jacksonville on the S" John's and at Tampa bay or
Charlotte's harbor, points which can be approached by sailing Wessels
and on information being received here of the number so to be sup-
plied, measures will be taken before the commencement of active
operations to detach this service from the Army altogether and employ

JESUP T. S. Maj. Gen. Garey's Ferry, Florida.
SIR, I have received from Major Graham reports of his proceedings
under the appointment of agent for the Seminole emigration, con-
ferred upon him by you, and have conveyed to him the approval
of the Department. I presumed that the arrangement you contem-
plated, when you assigned that officer, and Lieut" Casey" and
Searle " to duty in the Indian Department, had reference to the
execution of the convention of Camp Dade,” and that it of course
terminated, when the Seminoles broke their engagements. I there-
fore thought it proper to take some measures now for the removal
of these Indians, whenever they should have been brought to consent
to emigrate. The extent of the preparations in progress for the
military branch of the service, greater than at any previous period,
induced me to suppose, that the unwillingness to be troubled with
the accounts of the emigration expressed in your letter of the 8th of
March last,” would be increased, rather than diminished. It appeared
to me desirable therefore, as a measure of relief to yourself, that an
officer should be specially assigned to the duties of Superintendent
and Disbursing agent for the emigration of the Seminoles. Upon
enquiry I discovered a great reluctance to have Major Graham
withdrawn from his duties in the field, and I also learned that Lieu"
Casey's duties, as assistant Comm” were sufficiently arduous. I
have therefore requested that Capt P. Morrison * might be assigned
to duty in the Indian Department, and shall instruct him to take
upon himself, the duties of Superintendent and Disbursing agent of
the emigration. You will oblige me by expressing to Major Graham
and Lieu" Casey and Searle the satisfaction of the Department with
the manner in which they have discharged the duties temporarily
confided to them.
I will thank you to give Capt Morrison ample information of all
that has been done, and to turn over to him the papers, accounts
and funds in your hands, or in those of other officers, acting under

for August 21*1837; and thank you for your attention in transmitting

I am desirous of obtaining, if possible, statements of the accounts
of all the Banks in Florida, on or about the 1" of January 1837,
and the 1* of July, 1837, in order to institute a comparison of their
condition previous to, and subsequent to the suspension of specie
payment. A statement on the files of the Department, of the accounts

the two statements you have just forwarded, are the only returns I
have from Banks in Florida of a later date than those given in the
Treasury Report of Jany 3" 1837. If you can forward to me the
desired accounts, you will render essential aid in completing a public
document which may be of more value to the state and Territorial
Authorities than to those of the United States’ Government.

[NA:HF, 24 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
FLORIDA. Sep' 16" 1837–
HON: LEVI WOODBURY Secretary of the Treasury,
SIR. The undersigned citizens resident in the Collection District
of Appalachicola in Florida, respectfully state that great inconvenience
is suffered by the Merchants of the Cities of St Joseph and Appala-
chicola owing to their being at this time in the same Collection District
and their being but one Custom House and Collector for both. The
disposition and efforts of the present worthy Collector Major G. J.
Floyd to promote the interests and convenience of the residents
of both places having business at the Custom House, it is true in some
measure lessens the evil, but the rapidly increasing and intensive
commerce and business of the River Appalachicola of which these
ports are the only outlets, will soon render it out of the question for
any one officer to do so, even at a greater sacrifice of time, expence
and personal trouble that he now so cheerfully makes. The interests,
feelings and trade of the Citizens of the two Ports are dissimilar,
disconnected and distinct and require distinct and separate offices.
The fact that they are supposed to be rival Towns, should we submit
be sufficient to call for their being disunited as far as possible to
prevent clashing of official duties and unavoidable imputations against
officers. The interests of the Government also makes the division
of the District and the appointment of a Collector, who should be a
citizen of Florida, at each port necessary. Those interests cannot
be well attended to properly by one officer however vigilant. Our
Delegate in Congress will however explain to you personally our

SIR: Your communication of the 6* Ins" enclosing an Extract
of a letter from General Jesup to the Secretary of War * has been
received.
The Steamers American and Major Dade, have in conformity with
your order been transfer’ed to the Army. The American as I under-
stand is undergoing repairs and the Major Dade was sold as unfit for
service having sunk at her anchors: The Cutters are also no longer
attached to my command, having been ordered in conformity with
your instructions to report to the collector at their different stations,
with the exception of the Jefferson which is still at the Navy Yard
under repairs. Her Commander has however been notified that he
will receive orders the moment his repairs are completed. It will
afford me pleasure to do all in my power to aid Gen' Jesup in his
operations in Florida; I fear however that the same degree of elestreity
alacrity cannot be expected from the Navy as was exhibited during
the last winter. Lieut"Johnstons, Powell and Hunter rendered every
service that could be asked from them, indeed more than could fairly
be expected. Nevertheless no mention of their services in the many,
very many General Orders lauding the merits, Bravery, Gallantry
perseverance, &c &c, of volunteers, Militia & Regular forces engaged
in the War in Florida. Lieutenant Johnston has received a leave of
absence from the Dep" and Lieut Hunter is the First of this ship.—
The Squadron, when ordered to sea, which will be early in October,
will have direction's to examine the Coast of Florida and prevent any
supply of amunition from reaching the Indians. This was the case
during the last winter but nothing was intercepted nor do I think
that any was obtained by the Indians in the manner supposed.

Sir, It affords me great pleasure to forward to you the copy of a
letter received from the U. S. District Attorney, on the 17th instant *
in reference to the intrusion made upon the public Live Oak Planta-
tion; to which his attention for a long time past, had been drawn by
my predecessor; and, myself in writing, I do not know, and of course
have never conversed with that Gentleman.
The notice of representations made by us collectively, and the
measures adopted by you, in such orders as you may have given to
the Attorney, promise the best results; Based on his opinion, I shall
immediately warn Mess” LeBarron and Innerarity against tresspass-
ing; and, will as far as the limits are ascertained, of reserved public
domain, discribe them in the Newspaper,
I would reccommend a furthur Critical enquiry into the manner in
which these persons assumed a right of possession or occupacy, and
another careful Re-survey of what they claim as theirs; Yet if their
right is indisputable, our boundaries marked by the best growth of
trees, ought not to be subject to injury, if not total loss, by the
culpable negligence, not to say design of those appointed to protect
their individual property.

Since I came here the woods of promiscuous growth have been
fired for clearing; and, the effect has been so far felt, as to blast
numerous of our Young Live oak Growth.
The appointment of a superintendant of the Plantation, taken from
any class supplied by accident; and, continued from necessity; does
not afford sufficient protection. The place is worth preservation,
and any or all care that can be bestowed now, will reward the Navy
some years hence, I think it might be convinient and desirable to
some officer, a Lieutenant, disqualified for sea service to take the
superintendency, on Service pay, which I think necessary, There
are several such; now, borne on the Books here; He would require
a Boats crew of Six men, A horse or two &c &c—the Crew to be im-
ployed in trimming up—planting out &c when he has no better use
for them, and the season admits. The fact of an Officer being thus
placed, over the Plantation; would of itself, give security. As it
now is, and has been, the power of the Commandant of the Yard,
only ideally reaches it. I have personally inspected the place twice,
and other Officers also by my direction; from their observation;
and, my own, I predicate these suggestions; You will bear in mind
that I am located nine miles from the spot of which I speak, and a

The ravenous appetite for the possession of soil which has beset,

caused present Claimants, at a venture of Cost or less, to make the

to be set aside; I think, but a useful lesson might be taught to others;
who, by their example, may be induced or seduced into like error.
I may be considered as speaking very freely to you on this, and other
subjects, the only apology, if any is desired, that I offer is; that, I
have no local interest here to protect, nor acquaintance with the like
interest of others; I act, and have only acted, as Commandant

Lands in Florida required for Naval purposes on account of the live
oak Timber found thereon
In reply I have the honor to refer you to the enclosed copy of a

Receiver at Tallahassee," as containing a list of all the tracts in
Frac Township 3 of Range 29 South and West, known to this Office
to have been reserved as live oak lands and from which it will be seen
that the frac' Section 10 particularly referred to by the District
Attorney as having been sold is not included. No part of this Town-
ship was ever offered at public sale and no land therein can be legally
entered at private sale, consequently the sale of this section 10 as

SIR, In the letter which I had the honor to address you, dated the
16" instant,” but which went only by the last mail, in regard to my
accounts &c sent by that mail to the first auditor of the Treasury, I
forgot to mention the explanation which you had requested, of the
increase of rent here of the public Store and customs house. Soon
after I received your letter, in which you noticed the Subject, I saw
M. Perpall the owner of the house, and he observed to me, that I
must be aware that our rents, like everything else, Since our Indian
War had risen in price. This is really the fact—every necessary of
life, in this place, has become very high—provisions particularly, of
every kind, and the owners of houses and Stores to rent, have no more
Scruples of conscience than the Sellers of eatables—
If we do not Soon Subdue the Indians and entirely get rid of them
in Florida, we had better remove to Texas, as this Territory formerly
so hopeful, has become almost hopeless. We now inhabit a very dis-
tressed and impoverished Country.
I Send you enclosed, M* Perpall's letter to me respecting the increase
of his rent.

(Copy) TALLAHASSEE 28th NO" 1837.
SIR, In case you may suppose me too negligent (in which ’tis true
I have been) in the performance of the duties prescribed to me by
your Office in the year 1835, I have the honor to make you acquainted
in detail with the circumstances which produced the failure in making
out the returns which are usual with your Deputies.
In surveying the Appalachicola River I was forced as a matter of
necessity to observe the triangular mode of survey, and in so doing
I must have made a considerable error and am therefore unable to
form the plats, or rather close the maps in accordance with the usage
of your department
I have in vain tried every means to close the maps so as to make a
correct survey, but find it utterly impossible. A re-survey will be
absolutely necessary, and I should have undertaken it myself long
since, had my health have permitted it, which has been been bad and
is at this time in rather a precarious situation, and I have my doubts
whether I could survive the swamps of Appalachicola were I now to go
in them. The other surveys (the one West of the River is completed,
also the Island in the Appalachicola and the Islands appertaining
to the large survey together with the notes of those surveys.

my excessive & constant occupation in my Circuit. I have just

436 T E R R I TO RIA L PA P E R S
finished a long & busy Term in Franklin, and am now holding Court
in this County *—And this will be proper prelude to the subject
matter of this letter—Cannot you get Congress to relieve me from
the present onerous & unequal duty imposed upon me since the
annexation of Franklin County to my District?" This can be
done by the reannexation of that County to the Western District,
from which it was transferred without due consideration in my
opinion—You know the history & cause of the change—Before it
occurred my District with its old limits, contained more than half
of the population & wealth, and a far greater proportion of the
business of all Florida.
What then led to the change? You will not ask this question but
others may & it may be briefly thus answered while the business of
Franklin County was inconsiderable and the means of access to it by
public conveyances only occasional & infrequent, there was some
irregularity in the holding the regular Terms of its Court, by the
Judge of the Western District—Occasional sickness of the Judge
added causes of failure also—The people became dissatisfied &
clamorous, for a new District to which they believed the growing
importance of their County entitled them, and which they con-
ceived its remote & isolated situation required—Not being able to
induce Congress to establish a new District and conceiving that any
change would be acceptable, and at least quiet the clamors of the
people Col" White had it annexed to the Middle District—I protested
against it at the time, but only acquiesced in it as a temporary expe-
dient—The share of compensation to me for the two Terms a year
in Franklin, by the striking off two Terms annually from Hamilton
& Madison, was altogether illusory—Those last two Courts could be
held in less than a week by a travel of 150 miles—While the two
Terms in Franklin will require 20 days in Court, and a travel to &
fro of about 900 miles from my place of residence in the center of my
District! Besides the business in Franklin already large is rapidly
increasing—Let me give you a notion of my present duties—Before
the addition of Franklin to my District—I held annually 10 Courts
in five Counties, besides the Court of Appeals—Three of those
Counties are large & populous & the business of their Courts con-
siderable as you know—Now I hold the same number of Courts in
Six Counties I do not recollect the number of Courts which the
Judge of the Western District holds, but except in Escambia &
Jackson Counties, the business is trifling and the business of neither
of his Courts is equal to either one of four in my present District—
But I can scarcely by possibility get through all these Courts for
* Jefferson.
* See ante, p. 270.


## p. 437 (#451) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R I TO R Y 437
want of time—You know that Courts can not for many reasons be
held in this Territory except between about the 1st of Nov & the
middle or last of May—The warm weather & the absence & occupa-
tion of the Inhabitants & sickness at other seasons limits the sessions
to the above period of the year. Now this interval is scarcely suffi-
cient to enable me to hold 10 Terms of the Superior Court, and
attend for near a month on the Court of Appeals in Tall" Moreover
the travelling is great, fatiguing & dangerous—For instance I had to
hurry frm Apalachicola to this place by sea & but for a casual vessel
offering to S' Marks would have been compelled to perform the
voyage by sea in an open Boat—This arose from the low stage of
water in the River, a casualty of frequent occurrence Now I must
admit that the Inhabitants of Franklin & the Lawyers of my District
(whose business by the present arrangement can be more conveniently
conducted,) are opposed to the seperation of Franklin from the
Middle District—The Grand Jury at their late session expressed
themselves to that effect & may send on their general Presentment
to you—But is that a reason for continuing to overtask me so un-
equally? By the way the Grand Jury err in their calculations of
distances, and their estimate of the practicability of the routes of
travel for the respective Judges to Apalachicola—From my residence
in Jefferson near this place and in the very centre of my District, it
is 225 miles to apalachicola, and it cannot exceed that distance from
the last place to Pensacola, in the extreme western part of Judge
Camerons District—Moreover by Land & river travelling our routes
are equal in certainty—& by sea the opportunities are more favorable
to Pensacola.
Now my dear Sir, do attend & make this grievance known—This
next session of the Leg” Cl will probably lead to a seperation of
Franklin into two Counties each of which will require a Superior
Court—This will render the duty still more onerous & insupportable.
The Grand Jury seek to reconcile me to the present state of things
by recommending an increase of salary for these extra duties—This
I know is not to be hoped for however just—But it would not remove
the objection with me to a continuance of the present unequal dis-
tribution of duties, tho' it might somewhat alleviate my disappoint-
ment in that object—
Has it ever occurred to you and others to compare the quantum
of labor required of the Judge of this District at the establishment
of the Court—and at the present time? At first two Courts—with
no Court of appeals—the business very trifling—The salary then
1500$—now the business increased 100 fold salary 1800$—I am the
poorest paid & hardest worked Judge on the civil list of the Federal
Gov" This you know—

A word more, If Franklin is to continue annexed to my District,
the Act of Congress fixing the time of its session must be repealed
& its regulations referred to the Legislative Council—Now it comes
directly in conflict both in the spring & fall with my other Courts—
This I suggest as an important indispensable change in every & any
view—Do not neglect it—
Now my dear Sir, may I expect you to attend to this as not only
an important private concern of mine, but as a matter of general
concernment to Florida? Do let me hear soon from you on this &
other matters.
I shall speedily, probably by the same mail trouble you with
another letter to the Delegate about Court houses—jails—a Law
Library" &c Appropriations for all these objects have I learn been
made to other Territories & for the first to other Districts of this
Territory—We require them absolutely for the due administration of

TO THE HONORABLE CHARLES DOWNING, Delegate in Congress.
Sir, At the request of many of the most influential and wealthy
citizens of the County of Franklin, I beg leave to call your attention
to the creation of a new Judicial District with a Judge to reside at, or
80 Post, p. 467.
* Richard C. Allen, then at Washington, addressed a letter to Downing, Jan.
17, 1838 (NA, HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.), urging the establishment of a new judicial
district.
* H. R. 497, introduced by the Committee on the Territories, Jan. 30, 1838
(House Journal, 25 Cong., 2 sess., p. 330), provided for the establishment of a
new judicial district. It resulted in the act approved July 7, 1838 (5 STAT. 294),
which created the Apalachicola District comprising the counties of Franklin,
Washington, and Jackson.

in the vicinity of one of the cities of Appalachicola and St Joseph—
The rapidly increasing trade and commerce of those cities render it
highly important that a Judge clothed with Admiralty powers should
reside at one of the above cities, where access could be easy to him
and where orders could be granted and summary process awarded,
frequently highly requisite in cases of maratime jurisdiction.—
The importance of this subject struck the citizens of the County of
Franklin in a very strong point of view two or three years since, and
a strong petition was forwarded to our late Delegate praying the
creation of a Judicial District to embrace the Counties of Franklin,
Washington & Jackson *—A favorable report ('tis understood) was
made by the Committee in Congress, but the evil was attempted to
be remedied by transferring the County of Franklin to the Middle
District." This however failed notwithstanding the indefatigable
labours and untireing industry of the Judge of that District in the
discharge of his duties, and who I understand has applied to be
relieved from holding his courts in the County of Franklin.—It may
be proper here to remark, that that County will at the ensuing Session
of our Legislature will be divided, and a law passed requiring terms
of Court also to be held at S* Joseph as they now are at Appalachi-
cola—The rivalry between those cities, their separate and distinct
interests, the inconvenience and expence to jurors & parties of one
section of the County in attending Courts a great distance from them,
imperiously demand that such a law should be passed. You will
readily perceive, that in consequence of the passage of this law,
heavier duties will necessarily devolve on the Judge than those
already demanded of him. The products of a large portion of Western
Georgia, the Eastern section of Alabama, and Middle & West Florida
are wafted down the Chattahoochee, Flint & Appalachicola Rivers,
and are shipped at the ports of App" and S" Joseph. "Tis estimated
for the coming year, at least Seventy five thousand bales of cotton
will be exported from those places for foreign and domestic markets
beside other articles of trade amounting to four millions of Dollars,
and a corresponding amount of goods imported to supply the demands
and wants of the Merchants & inhabitants of the interior—
The Commerce arising from, and incidental to this importation
and exportation to the amount in all of nearly Eight millions, neces-
sarily creates a good deal of litigation, and questions of insurance,
salvage and others and others of a maratime nature must constantly
arise, requiring speedy and Summary action. As we are now Situated,
we are obliged in procuring the simplest order to travel upwards of

Two hundred miles to the residence of the Judge, which is beyond
Tallahassee, and this with no regular mode of Conveyance.—
It is looked upon as a matter of certainty, that a port of entry will
be established at S* Joseph,” and in that event, the cases involving
questions of infraction of the Revenue laws will be multiplied as well
as those otherwise incidental to commerce, owing to therapidly increas-
ing trade of that city, and the past warrants the assertion, that the
rights of parties have been materially affected and jeopardied for the
want of timely adjudication—No doubt can exist, but that the
interests of Goverment would be highly subserved by the creation of
the District.—
The Judge of the Western District resides at Pensacola distant
two hundred & eighty miles from App" & S*Joseph, so that we would
not be placed in a better condition by being re-transferred to that
District—
The trade and commerce of those cities are progressing rapidly and
necessarily keeping pace with the growing resources of the extensive
Country tributary to them, and the present necessity of a new District
will become greater and more urgent every successive year—

HON: CHARLES DOWNING Delegate in Congress from Florida
SIR, Every days transaction in the way of my Official duties as
Collector of this District, convinces me more fully of the necessity
of legislative action on the part of Congress in relation to the estab-
lishment of a new Collection District out of the Districts of Appa-
lachicola and Pensacola, but especially out of the latter; for there
are and always have been doubts as to the Bay of S" Joseph being
in the Appalachicola District; and it was with some difficulty I was
enabled to effect a decision to that effect by the Secretary of the
Treasury; and I believe the actual necessities of the case (for if con-
sidered in the Pensacola District merchants would be compelled to
go to Pensacola to make a Foreign entrance or clearance, a distance

of One hundred miles) solely induced him to do so from official
courtesy and under the strongest impression, that the application
for a division would be pressed upon Congress at an early day.—
Indeed, the commerce of St Joseph fully justifies its becoming a Port
of Entry, for there have been several Foreign arrivals, from Liverpool
& Havanna and some four or five ships have been cleared for Liverpool,
all which appears on the books at the Port of Entry—Appalachicola.—
Present appearances induce the beleif, that S" Joseph will do the
largest portion of the commerce of the App" River this Season, and
I am Satisfied that at least thirty thousand bales of Cotton will be
exported from this place during the coming Season and at least one
third thereof carried direct to Liverpool.
From these facts, the many changes requisite in Marine documents
and the utter impossibility of one officer doing justice to both places
and at the same time his duty to the Government, you will at once
perceive the strong and urgent necessity of there being a new Collec-
tion District and a new Collector appointed—I have expressed a wish
in case of the division to be appointed for the new District.
I take the liberty of setting out substantially such a law as I deem
proper, principally however to point out the boundaries of the New
District.—
“Be it enacted that all the ports, harbours, shores and waters of
the mainland of Florida, and of the Islands opposite and nearest
thereto extending from the Southern extremity of S" Joseph Bay and
Cape S" Blas to the Eastern entrance of S* Rosa's Sound be and they
are hereby, established a Collection District, by the name of the S*
Joseph's District, and a port of entry shall be established at S" Joseph
for said District, and a Collector shall be appointed, who shall give
the same bond, perform the same duties, and be entitled to the same
fees and compensation as the Collectors of the other Districts in
Florida—”
Possessing as you do the requisite boundaries of the District in
anticipation and all necessary local information, of course the bill
can be introduced without delay, the interests of this section of
Country demanding speedy action—
I shall leave for Washington on the 20" of this month, and Co.'
Hawkins I believe somewhat sooner.—Your friends here are generally
well—

DR SIR. As you have no leisure to read long letters I shall be
brief—My salary as Sec” is 1500 dols my board for my family at a
private boarding house is $2300 per annum, at Browns it would be
double that sum. I can not keep house here for less than 4000 per
annum—I know that the duties of my office whilst the Gov" is pres-
ent are as light as my salary, but it should be recollected that the
sec is compelled to remain at Tallahassee to play Gov" when ever
his Excellency may think proper to leave the Territory, and that he
should receive at least as much money as will feed him whilst wait-
ing to discharge the duties of Gov when the Gov is absent: Whilst
the SecY is Acting Gov" he should of course receive a compensation
adequate to the expences of his station. You recollect at the organ-
ization of the Territorial Gov" the sec' & Judges had the same sal-
aries, but since that time the salaries of the Judges have been increased

to raise my salary to 2000 dolls—which will enable me to board my

my expences should I act as Gov". It is useless to write more on
this subject you know something about the expences of Tallahassee.—
I have been appointed by the Gov' to prepare the compilation of
the laws of Florida or rather I have made a contract with him.”
Westcott rec" 2700 dols of the appropriation and the balance of the
appropriation has been transfered to the surplus fund—Westcott has
been sued for the amt rec" by him, but I should be very unwilling
that he or any other man should be pressed, to obtain money to pay
me, and moreover there will be great delay in the publication for
want of the money. It would be much better to have the balance
of the appropriation which was transfered to the surpluss fund,
reappropriated and also 2700 dolls appropriated by Congress at once."
The whole appropriation by Congress for the compilation of the laws
of the Territory was $4500. If the money could be had by May
I could by that time have the compilation of the laws complete,
printed and bound—I have only now the acts of 1834 to compile,
having last summer compiled the acts of the previous years—You
well know how much this work is wanted in Florida—At the last
session of Congress some member from Mass introduced a resolution
by the direction of the legislature of Mass to frank letters & commu-
nications from & to Gov" & Sec” of the different states—Be so good
as to move to have the resolutions extended to the Gov" & Sec" of
Territories.—You know that there would be more propriety in extend-
ing this priviledge to Gov' & Sec" of Territories than of states, as
the former have to transact more business in which the U States is
interested than the latter—My relations Gov Pope” of Ky & Clai-

COLLECTORS OFFICE District of Apalachicola 29* December 1837
SIR. Having been requested, by the Merchants and citizens of
Saint Joseph and Apalachicola, to express my opinion as to the neces-
sity of the establishment of a new Judicial District out of the middle
and western Districts of Florida, I beg leave to state that great incon-
venience has been experienced by myself in the discharge of my duty
as Collector of the Customs for the Dis' of Apalachicola, which office
I have had the honor to hold over eight years, and from my experi-
ence during this time many many cases of high importance have
been neglected for want of a regular term or siting of the court, and
altho the act of Congress directs the regular holding of the court in
Apalachicola, yet such are the difficulties in traviling in Florida at
certain seasons of the year, and the distance of the Judges so remote,
that no time which they could devote to our county will enable either
of them to do justice to Apalachicola
The Exports and Imports from and to this county equal Ten Mil-
lions of dollars in value which it is presumed will produce the con-
viction in any mind of the necessity of a court, for in the transaction
of business to this amount, many cases occur which require the
investigation and promptest decission of a court both of a public and
private nature
In conclusion I will venture to say that no part of the United
States is labouring under the same difficulties and inconveniences for
the want of the legal facilaties to enforce contracts &C &C—

& that if suffered to be discontinued for want of funds the utility of
what has been already expended will be greatly diminished from the
incomplete state of the wall.
Your petitioners pray for a further appropriation to complete the
said wall. they know that a considerable amount has been already
appropriated, but the estimates for the work were presented in 1834.”
the price of white and slave labor, provisions, & materials, were so
much advanced, about the time that the work commenced, that it
sufficiently accounts for the appropriation being found inadequate for
the completion of the wall
Your petitioners further show that the wall which was commenced
in 1834 by Lieut Tuttle * required to be taken away & reconstructed
which operation created an additional expence not included as your
petitioners believe in the estimate furnished to the Government
The wall cannot be said to be completed and will not protect the
harbour from filling up unless it is carried up to Wallen Street 734
feet beyond the barrack wharf. three fourths of the property on this
line is owned by Government and is daily washing into the harbour
for want of this protection—
There has been nearly completed 1600 feet of the wall which in its
unfinished state has during the past summer stood the test of the most
severe gales experienced for many years, the work is highly creditable
to the skill & industry of Mr Dancy the superintendant and your peti-
tioners have the fullest confidence in the energy ability, & integrity of
that gentleman. & your petitioners venture to hope that this their
reasonable prayer will meet with a favorable reception and the appro-
priation asked for so applied as to construct at once a monument of
the liberality of the United States and of the gratitude of this the most
ancient city within the limits of the union *

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY THE LAKE WIMICO AND ST.
JOSEPH CANAL AND RAILROAD COMPANY
[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[January 2, 1838]
To the Congress of the United States.
The petition of “The Lake Wimico & St Joseph Canal and Rail
Road Company” of Florida, respectfully shews, That by the Act of
the Congress of the United States, approved the [blank] day of
[blank]" eighty feet of the public lands is given and granted to the
said company from the town of St Joseph on the Gulph of Mexico,
to Tennessee Bluff or elsewhere on the Apalachacola River, for the
purpose of constructing a rail road thereon, and by the same act, all
the public lands, which front on the said space of eighty feet, is
reserved from sale.—That soon after the passage of the Act, the
Company caused the necessary surveys and estimates to be made,
and early in March 1837 placed the construction of the whole road
under contract, which is now on the verge of completion. That the
road when completed will be twenty nine miles in length and will
cost the company, exclusive of necessary buildings, Stations, Engines,
Carrs, tools &c, four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars.—
That the country through which it passes is uninhabited, the lands
poor and unfit for cultivation, being in the familliar parlance of the
country, denominated “pine barren.” That the space of eighty feet,
or forty feet on each side of the track, is insufficient to protect the
road from obstruction and injury, arising from the casual falling of
trees—. That to preserve the road from injury, to guard against
accidents and give security to persons and property trasported over
it, the timber should be felled to the distance, of at the least, one
hundred feet on each side of the track. The said company further
represents, that this important and expensive work has been under-
taken and nearly finished, whithout asking extraordinary priviledges
from the Territorial Legislature, or invoking the liberal pecuniary aid
so often granted by Congress to encourage and promote the construc-
tion of works of this character. That the building of this rail road,
and other works constructed by the said company, on and near to the
Bay of St Joseph, has been the means of selling more than twenty
thousand acres of the public domain, which otherwise would not have
found purchasers, as the only value which these lands possess is de-
rived from the works and improvements made by the company.
That the rail road comp” merits the countenance and protection of

the Government in asmuch as the road now being constructed,
conects the Bay of St Joseph with the Interior. That the Bay of St.
Joseph, from its position on the coast, the depth of water into it, the
Perfeet entire security of the harbour, and perfect salubrity of the
climate, all combine to render it of the highest importance in a national
point of view, and sooner or later must receive the attention from the
Government, which its position and other great advantages entitle
it.—That this railroad forms the first link in the great line which is to
extend from the Atlantic Ocean, across the peninsula of Florida, to
the Gulph of Mexico. A work, than which, none has been designed
in this country, more strictly national in its character, or which would
be productive of more advantages to the country, or is more deserving
the fostering and helping hand of the Government. The company,
for these and other reasons entertain the hope that Congress will grant
to them and their sucessors every alternate quater section of the
public land which is intersected by the railroad, and the space of one
hundred feet on each side of the track, through the alternate quarter
sections, which will remain to the United States.
The undersigned takes leave here to remark that the company
desire the grant above prayed, not because the lands are esteemed of
any value, except for pine timber, which in that country is valueless
except to the company, for repairs to the road, and for the construc-
tion and repair of such fixtures as are necessary to the carrying on of
the business of the company. The space of two hundred feet is
necessary to the preservation of the work and the security of those
who pass over the road— And the quarter sections prayed for will
yield a supply of fuel for the Engines, and timber for the repairs and
renewal of the works—While all acquainted with the country through
which the road extends, must admit that the construction of the rail
road, has imparted a value to the one half of the land (or rather the
timber upon it) along the line of road, which the whole would never
have otherwise attained—And your petitioners will ever pray.

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY JOHN A. L. NORMAN
[NA:SF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.: Pr. *]
(January 15, 1838]
To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled:
The respectful petition of John A. L. Norman, of Florida, humbly
showeth to your honorable body, that he has been engaged for three
successive years, endeavoring to establish in the Territory of Florida
a general system of education, by founding an institution for the edu-
cating of schoolmasters, whereby the whole yeomanry of the country
might be educated; but that he has been prevented from carrying into
effect the wishes of his fellow-citizens, by the insurrection of the
Seminole Indians, and by which insurrection he is yet prevented.
The importance of educating the whole people of our republic is a
subject, it is believed, worthy the attention and action of Congress;
but this, it is most respectfully hoped, is more particularly the case in
the educating of an interesting and important portion of the republic,
now laid waste by a desolating savage foe.
Your memorialist would further urge, that Florida would, in conse-
quence of the many lamented dead, who have fallen in their country's
service, and now lie unhonored in her wilds; which dead, are highly
honorable and distinguished sons of the several States of the United
States, erect to their memories and worth a “mental monument,”
a university, to bear their names and noble daring to posterity; which
university, by the educating of the living, and by the inducing the
rising youth to imitate the patriotic example of the illustrious dead,
would not only be the most splendid monument that a feeling nation
could erect to the fallen brave, but would be the most effectual means
of strengthening and perpetuating our Union, to the latest times.
The more fully to bring this interesting subject to the particular
view of Congress, your memorialist would beg leave to state, that he
has had three successive councils of the Territory of Florida, warmly
to espouse the plan of education which he proposes, which is more

fully set forth by the memorial of the council, herewith respectfully
presented.
Your memorialist has consulted with the officers, and many distin-
guished members of your honorable body, and their views have been
in accordance with the desire of Florida, to the erecting of the said
university.
He has consulted with the generals, and the officers generally of the
United States army, who ardently desire this matter, and earnestly
solicit the same, that their lamented fellow-officers and soldiers may
be properly honored. Their proper signatures to this effect are here-
with respectfully presented.
He has consulted with the generals, and officers generally, of the
volunteers of the different States, and they earnestly desire Congress
to grant its aid to the properly honoring the memories of their lamented
compatriots. Their signatures to this effect are herewith respectfully
presented.
Your memorialist would respectfully present the memorial to Con-
gress of the Tennessee brigade, under General Robert Armstrong, in
the service of the United States in Florida, during the present Seminole
war, praying the erection of the said university, in manner and form
therein more particularly expressed. All of which is most respectfully
presented.”
Your memorialist would further most respectfully present the letter
of request signed by the Louisiana Legislature, praying the aid and
influence of the Louisiana delegation in Congress, to give their sanction
and influence in Congress, to the founding of the said university, for
the reasons therein mentioned. All of which is most respectfully
presented.
Your memorialist has also consulted with the relations and friends
of the brave dead, who have fallen in the battles of Florida, and they
have feelingly expressed a desire that the remains of those once dear
to them by every tender tie of nature and affection, and now rendered
doubly dear by the sad manner of their loss, may be removed from
the wilds and morasses where they now lie, and be placed in conse-
crated ground, where affection may weep over them, and where
christians may mourn over them.
He has consulted the most distinguished citizens of the different
States of the Union, both public and private, and they have invariably
expressed their warmest desire that this mental monument, this uni-
versity, should be erected, whereby the living might be educated, the
moral condition of the people improved, the nation rendered more
powerful and lasting, and the lamented dead properly honored.

Your memorialist has consulted the citizens of the Territory of
Florida generally, many of their signatures being herewith respectfully
presented, who earnestly solicit the granting of a township of land to
Florida, for the purpose of erecting said “mental monument” or uni-
versity, not only for the properly honoring the worthy dead, but that
the youth of the Territory being educated thereby, ignorance, vice,
and infamy may not be permitted to overrun the people, and this
otherwise beautiful portion of the republic become a degredation and
a nuisance to the several States of the confederacy.
Therefore, your memorialist prays of your honorable body, that
you will grant to Florida a township of land, for the purposes respect-
fully prayed in his memorial, in such manner and form as your
honorable body shall judge most likely to insure the desirable results
therein prayed.

the Legislative Council of Florida, a petition praying from Congress
the grant of a township of land to Florida, in manner and form therein
more fully set forth, for the purpose of founding the “Dade Insti-

the honoring of the dead, and the educating of the living, which liv-
ing have been made impoverished orphans by a savage foe, we think
highly worthy the attention and patronage of Congress.
Be it, therefore, resolved, by the Governor and Legislative Council of
Florida, That our Delegate in Congress be, and he is hereby, respect-

SIR/ I write you from the vicinity of the Indian towns on the
Apalachicola river, at which I have spent several days investigating
their complaints in conformity with your letter appointing me Special
Agent of the War department.”
With their various complaints I have made myself pretty well
acquainted, but there being at this time a number of captured and
surrendered fugitive Creek Indians incamped at their towns, still in
possession of their arms and no military force present, I have been
advised by the Interpreter that for the present, the Subject of the
relinquishment of their reserves, and that of their emigration, Should
not be mentioned, as it might be attended with bad consequences
to both parties. So soon as this obstacle is removed, which will
take place in a short time, I will urge the Subject upon them, and
report to you fully on the Subject I have been informed by the

Interpreter that the Indians have intimated to him that their lands
are worth more than the price Stipulated in the last treaty, and that
if the Government would give them a Sum Something larger, they
would have no objection to emigrating. In antisipation of Such a
difficulty, I would Suggest, whether it might not be adviseable to
vest me with authority to allow them more upon the express condition
of their immediate emigration
The principal object however of this letter was to communicate
to you certain facts in relation to the conduct of Ach" Smith, the
Sub Agent, which lately came to my knowledge.
For the avowed purpose of Selling Spiritous liquors, and other im-
proper articles to the Indians, he has established a tipling Shop near
their towns, at which the Indians frequently meet and become So
intoxicated and riotous as to alarm the neighbourhood. With full
knowledge of the fact that there were in the neighbourhood some
thirty or forty Creek Indians in possession of their arms, and un-
guarded by a military force, he permitted the Indians of the town to
purchase a large number of flints, and it is believed other munitions,
at Said store. I have been also informed that he is opposed to the
emigration of the Indians, and is using his influence to prevent it.
In addition to these charges, I have learned from the Indians that
their last annuity was paid in depreciated Bank paper, by which they
conceive themselves defrauded.

constantly exercised to do justice to the Government (I have faith-
fully Served for twenty Seven years) & justice to the claimants under
the Treaty, even to the injury of the faithful Officers engaged in this
important, but thankless Service. I have only to regret that the
lameness of the existing laws (in not compelling the claimants to come
forward and identify their claims) threw my Deputies at their mercy,
to numerous and vexatious delays, under heavy expenses, and in many
instances, jeoapardizing the Public interest—and producing almost
ruin to some of the Officers engaged and of which your predecessor
M Grayham seemed well convinced as you will perceive from the
correspondence first herein refered to. I will barely remark that the
same apathy existed on the part of the claimants in the Western Land
District untill they found (from a notice published by meat Pensacola)
that their lands would have to be Surveyed as public lands, when they
they turned out praise worthily, and hence we became enabled to lay
down their claims, giving as I believe General Satisfaction. Not so
in the East, and the Statements of the Surveyors N° 2, & 3 Specify
Some of the reasons, and were others at hand volumes of testimony
might be adduced, and some of a Strange Character. My Report on

[Enclosure]
Henry Washington to Robert Butler
(Copy) Tallahassee FLORIDA 8 January 1838
SIR In answer to your enquiries in relation to the Survey of Pri-
vate Claims in East Florida, I have to state that I made use of
every possible exertion to survey all confirmed Private Land Claims
at all times, in the different sections of country in which I have been
engaged as a Deputy Surveyor
Proceeding under your instructions, I could not have been insensi-
ble of the high obligation imposed upon me in surveying every con-
firmed Private Land Claim within the limits of my respective Dis-
tricts, when the claimants came forward and furnished me with the
certificates of confirmation and other documents to enable me to
make the survey, pointing out at the same time the location of the
land claimed, and the original boundaries if surveyed under the
Spanish Authorities. I can safely affirm that I made this a solemn
part of my duty in every instance, and I can confidently appeal to
the people generally, in the respective neighbourhoods where I have
been employed, to the truth of this assertion.
Bound by contract with the Government to complete the surveys
of the public land by a stated time & required to separate the private
claims from the public domain, I was directed by you to give every
facility to the Private Claimants by advertisement and otherwise, to
enable me to effect this desirable object. In pursuance of this part
of my duty I made it a rule to write a public notice in the Florida
Herald (a paper published at St Augustine) before commencing the
survey of a contract for Surveying embracing private claims, designat-
ing the tract of country to be surveyed, and requesting the claimants
to furnish me with the certificates of confirmation, a copy of their
grants & Surveys, if any, under the hand and seal of the keeper of
Public Archives to enable me to execute impartial justice. In addi-
tion to all this I called upon personally, or notified every claimant,
within convenient distance of the place of my operations, asking in
the most respectful terms that they would come forward with the
necessary official documents to enable me to survey their claims. In

lic roads, and at the most conspicuous places, and frequently walked
five or six miles in the morning to commence work, very much to
my embarrassment in proceeding with my public duties with the
necessary dispatch. In addition to this I frequently sent one of my
men, to St Augustine & other places, within the limits of my surveys
with a view and for the express purpose of ascertaining whether
there were any claimants to be found who were axious to come for-
ward, or send an agent to have their claims surveyed. Many of the
claimants gave a deaf ear to this respectful call.
My firm conviction is that many of the claimants are all together
opposed to having their claims surveyed by the U States for the
following reasons—Because the original surveys executed under the
Spanish Authority in many instances exceed greatly in quantity the
amount granted and subsequently conconfirmed by the United States,
and they calculate (& with truth) that their claims would be cut
down by a surveyor of the United States when there was a presumption
of fraud—Because there is in my opinion a strong disposition in E
Florida to embarrass the surveying Department of the Government.
You ask “were any of the claims enumerated in the memorial to
the Commissioner, ever presented to you for survey, and their loca-
tions identified during the period you were in your district in the
years 1834 & 1835?—I answer by saying that I saw M. Hallows who
was represented to be a part owner of the tract of ten thousand acres
claimed by Fatio's Estate. I conferred with M Hallows, as well as
I recollect before extending the lines of the public surveys through
Fatio's claim. He said he had heard from Col White that this claim
had been confirmed by the Supreme Court of the U States I have
no recollection of his having produced any Official evidence of con-
firmation from the Keeper of the Public Archives. I am well satis-
fied that no such evidence was produced I saw D" Simmons after
extending the lines of the public surveys thro' Fatios claim. I have
no recollection of his presenting me with the official evidence of a
claim with its location identified. I think he mentioned something
about his having a claim within the limits of Fatios claim
For the survey of the claim of R A Henderson I refer you to
T 6 R26 S & E, with the Commissioners Report thereon in Abstract
4 Report 1 Session of 1828—and to the decree of the Superior Court
of E Florida dated May 12* 1832. I have not the least recollec-
tion of the other claims mentioned in the list forwarded to you by
the Commissioner, well convinced that the claimants neither fur-
nished me with the evidence of confirmation, or the identity of the
location. I am well convinced that Gen Clinch knew where to find
me when he wished to do so

In conclusion it is proper to remark that I frequently wrote to the
Keeper of the Public Archives at St Augustine in relation to the
Private Claims, and that he invariably furnished me with every
information in his power throughout the whole of my surveys in E
Florida. I beg leave to refer you to him on this subject.

RESOLUTIONS BY CITIZENS OF TALLAHASSEE
[LC:Tallahassee, The Floridian, Feb. 3, 1838]
[January 29, 1838]
Public Meeting.
At a public meeting held in Tallahassee, by the citizens, and others
residing in the county of Leon, on the 29th day of January, 1838,
for the purpose of considering certain resolution adopted by a por-
tion of our fellow citizens, resident in Tallahassee, on the 23d instant,”
after due inquiry and consultation, the following resolutions were pro-
posed by Governor Duval, and subscribed to by the undersigned
citizens.
Whereas, as the resolutions passed by the said meeting, held at
the court house on the 23d inst. by some individuals, may probably
mislead the public mind, with regard to the energy, activity, and
exertions of Governor Richard K. Call, in repressing and guarding
our frontiers against the insiduous and destructive inroads of our
savage enemy, and especially in stating, that said meeting “believed
that no steps had been taken to apprise Maj. General Jesup of the
renewed hostilities on our borders, and whereas, it is believed, no
adequate measures have been adopted, to secure the permanent protec-
tion of our citizens, of Middle Florida,” all which may be implied,
that gross and criminal neglect on the part of the Executive of this
Territory. Be it therefore resolved, that the sentiments expressed
by the meeting of the 23d inst. are not the language of a majority
of our citizens, and we view with regret and pain, that any miscon-
ception should have arisen from the said resolution.

2d Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that our chief
magistrate, has done all that he had the power or means of effecting,
in providing for and giving protection, not only to our frontiers in
Middle Florida, but in West Florida, and without any aid, in men
or money, from the General Government, the Executive of Florida,
with the brave volunteers, who came at his request, have manfully
and efficiently defended our frontiers as far as it was practicable, with
the means at his command.
3d Resolved, That it is known to many, at this meeting, that near
one week previous to the resolutions of the 23d inst. that Governor
Call had authorised Gen. James Gadsden, to raise an efficient corps,
permanently to defend the frontier of Middle Florida, and had
pledged his private fortune to pay the brave men who might volun-
teer in this service, if the General Government or the Territory of
Florida, should not provide for their compensation.
4th, resolved, That we have undiminished confidence in the virtue,
capacity, energy, and ability of Gov. Call, to protect and guard our
frontiers, and that he has done, and we believe he will do, all that,
with his limited means, any man can accomplish.
5th. Resolved, That the delay of the Secretary of War, to have
the Florida troops paid, who were ordered into service by the Gov-
ernor, has presented serious embarrassments to the defence of our
country, and cannot be justified.

lican government, which is based and relies for its stability upon
the general intelligence and virtue of the people, the source whence
all political power eminates, to provide as early as possible, and in
the most ample manner which the circumstances of the community
will permit, for the education of the rising generation: And whereas,
Florida is almost entirely destitute of the necessary means for that
purpose on the account of the sterility of a considerable portion of
the sixteenth sections, which have been reserved for the support of
Schools, and in consequence of a large portion of the country having
been granted to private individuals by the British and Spanish
Governments, before its transfer to the United States, without any
reservation of school lands: And whereas, also owing to the great
extent and conformation of our sea coast, the number of islands
adjacent thereto, and the numerous large rivers and lakes with which
the interior of the county abounds, there are, and necessarily must
be, a great many fractional townships in this Territory, containing
less than sixteen sections each, none of which have any school lands.
It is therefore Resolved by the Governor and Legislative Council
of the Territory of Florida, That our Delegate in Congress be requested
to use his exertions to procure the enactment of a law, authorizing the
selection, in such manner as the Governor and Legislative Council
shall direct, other lands in place of such sixteenth sections, as shall
prove to be of little or no value on account of the sterility of their soil,
or other cause, and also the selection and location of a quantity of
lands equal to one thirty sixth part of all the lands which may have
been granted out as aforesaid by the British or Spanish Governments,
and of the said fractional townships, and authorizing the sale of said
lands, and of all other lands appropriated for the support of common
schools in this Territory, in such manner, and upon such terms, condi-
tions and provisions as are prescribed to the State of Ohio, in An Act
entitled An Act to authorize the Legislature of the State of Ohio to
sell the lands heretofore appropriated for the use of schools in said
state, approved 1st February 1826.”
And it is further Resolved, That a copy of the foregoing Preamble
and Resolution be signed by the President and Chief Clerk of this
Legislative Council, and transmitted forthwith to the Hon. Charles
Downing, our Delegate in Congress.

COURT OF APPEALS JUDGES TO DELEGATE DOWNING 25
[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.:LS]
Court of Appeals Room TALLAHASSEE Feby 3 1838.
To/ THE HONORABLE CHARLES DOWNING Delegate to Congress.
SIR. The Undersigned, Judges of the Court of Appeals of Florida,
would respectfully represent, through you their Delegate, to the
Honorable The Congress of the United States, a difficulty under
which they labor, in the discharge of their duties, which they humbly
conceive, it is competent and proper for the Congress to remove.
They allude to the pressing want of an adequate Law Library,
during their Sessions at this place. That a Law Library, commen-
surate in extent with the variety of legal questions, submitted to an
Appellate Court, and always accessible to its demand, is of indis-
pensible necessity, to the efficient discharge of its duties, no one can
deny. And it is only necessary, to reflect upon the variety & extent
of the powers & duties, conferred on this Court, to arrive at the Con-
clusion, that a Library comprehending all the branches of Law, Sub-
mitted to its cognizance, must be large and expensive.
As a Municipal Court, in the last resort, having appellate jurisdic-
tion over all the other Courts of the Territory, which possess the
Most unlimited Chancery and Common Law powers, both Civil and
Criminal the Scope of its jurisdiction equals in these particulars that
of any of the higher Courts, of the States of this Union; and as an
appellate Court in instance and admiralty causes, and in all cases in
which the United States is party, it has superadded to its functions,
those of the District and Circuit Courts of the United States. Causes
of this last description are of frequent occurrence, and at the present
Term of this Court, several most important causes in Admiralty have
been submitted to its decision.
24 House Journal, 25 Cong., 3 sess., pp. 208–209. The act approved June 15,
1844 (5 STAT. 666), provided that wherever the sixteenth sections were included
in confirmed private claims adjacent lands which had remained unsold after
being offered at public sale could be selected.

For the full investigation of all these important questions, the want
of an adequate number of Law books is most Sensibly felt. The
reasons for this deficiency, are most obvious. Other important State
& Federal Courts, are situate in large Cities in the older States, where,
if no public Libraries furnished by Governments, Exist, there are
found ample private Libraries conveniently accessible to their judges.
But even for the use of Courts thus circumstanced, it has been found
needful to establish distinct Libraries for Such Courts.
Here in a new Country & in a Small village, (both however rapidly
advancing in improvement,) in books as in all other conveniences and
“appliances” to the arts & sciences, the demand far exceeds the Supply
Private Libraries, in this place, are Small. The Judges and Lawyers
assemble here from very distant places, with no convenient means for
transporting their books—Moreover, in this place where Admiralty
causes do not frequently originate, there is an almost Intire absence,
of books of Admiralty and Commercial Law, from private Libraries.
They beg leave to represent this, most urgently, as a very great incon-
venience, under which this Court has long labored—They can not
flatter themselves, that any degree of industry & application, or that
any Extent of judicial Knowledge can Surmount it, and Enable Judges
laboring under such a privation, Satisfactorily & correctly, to discharge
their duties, and as, this Court, from the infrequency of Appeals to
the Supreme Court of the U States, (owing to the great delay &
Expense incident thereto,) is virtually in many Cases, a Court of the
last resort, errors unavoidably arising from its decisions thus disad-
vantageously made, May become in Some instances irremediable.
The Undersigned therefore request, that you will obtain from the
Congress an appropriation Sufficient to purchase for the use of this
Court, an ample Law Library—For this they understand there is a
precedent in a Similar appropriation for the New Territory of Wis-
consin. The Undersigned would not institute an invidious compar-
ison, when the allowance in Each case, is dictated by reasons of Sound
policy, but if any more cogent reasons can be required for such an
appropriation, they exist in relation to the Courts of Florida, from the
greater scope of their powers & duties—
As germane to this matter, the Undersigned beg leave also, to ask
your attention, to the application already made, by the District Judge
of Middle Florida, for an appropriation, for finishing or fitting up the
Court House, now building at this place, and which the local authori-
ties have not the means to complete. In addition to the reasons
advanced by the Judge of the Middle District, the Undersigned would
urge, that such aid from Congress would furnish the Court of Appeals,
with a Suitable Court room & officers, with no further expense to the
United States, which hitherto, they could not procure at this place,

Memorial.
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled:
Your petitioners, citizens of East Florida, beg leave most respect-
fully to represent to your Honorable body, that a law has been in-
troduced, and is likely to pass through the Legislative Council of this
Territory, calling a convention to form a State Constitution,” pre-
20 Presented to the House by Downing on Mar. 5, 1838 (House Journal, 25
Cong., 2 sess., p. 548). See also resolution by the Legislative Council, Feb. 2,
1838 (NA, HF, 25 Cong., 3 sess.), to the same purport. A report of the House
Committee, Jan. 11, 1839 (NAT, HF, printed, H. Rep. 159, 25 Cong., 3 sess., pp.
1–2), recommended an appropriation of $5000.00 for a library, but the bill failed
of passage.
27 Printed also in Dodd (ed.), Fla. Becomes a State, pp. 124–126, without signa-
tures or endorsements. The proceedings of the meeting at St. Augustine, Feb. 5,
1838, which caused the memorial to be drafted, is printed ibid., pp. 122–124.
A similar memorial from St. Johns Co. is in NA (SF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.).
2s Adopted, Feb. 7, 1838 (Fla., Terr., Acts, 1838, pp. 15–17). This act provided
for the election of members to the constitutional convention at St. Joseph the
first Monday in December. A House of Representatives resolution, Feb. 19, 1838
(House Journal, 25 Cong., 2 sess., p. 482), instructed the Committee on the Terri-
tories to enquire into the expediency of authorizing the Territory of Florida to
take a census and adopt a constitution preparatory to admission into the Union.
Two bills were introduced for the purpose, No. 780 on May 11, and No. 887 on
July 7, 1838, but neither passed (ibid., pp. 870, 1273; the second bill is printed in
Dodd (ed.), op. cit., pp. 126-131).
The constitutional convention met at St. Joseph from Dec. 3, 1838, to Jan.
11, 1839. The originals of its Journal of Proceedings and of the Constitution
which was framed are now missing (Dodd, ed., op. cit., pp. 461–462). They are
reprinted (ibid., pp. 132-329) from editions published at St. Joseph in 1839.
The official journal may be supplemented by newspaper reports reprinted in
Knauss, Terr. Fla. Journalism, pp. 130-226, from the pages of the Times (St.
Joseph) and The Floridian (Tallahassee). Robert R. Reid, the president of the
convention, transmitted a printed copy of the Constitution to the Vice President,
Feb. 11, 1839 (NA, SF, 25 Cong., 3 sess.). Upon its presentation, Feb. 11,

paratory to the admission of the entire Territory into the Union as
an independent State Government.
Against this measure your petitioners beg leave to enter their most
solemn protest.
Under the Spanish dominion, East and West Florida were governed
as separate and different Provinces, and Pensacola and St. Augustine
were the Capitals. One situated on the Gulph of Mexico, and the
other on the Atlantic, the points to which the business and intercourse
of the respective Provinces tended.
When they were organized by our National Government, they were
both included in one Territory, and the Capitol was established at
Tallahassee, a distance of 250 miles from the extreme of West Florida:
about 750 from the extreme of East Florida, and 200 miles from the
nearest point on the Atlantic shore.
To East Florida, this organization has been most peculiarly har-
rassing and vexatious. Our people have been connected with, and in
1839 (Senate Journal, 25 Cong., 3 sess., p. 254), it was referred to the Committee
on the Judiciary and ordered to be printed (S. Doc. 241, 25 Cong., 3 sess.). On
Feb. 20, 1839 (House Journal, 25 Cong., 3 sess., pp. 616–617), Del. Downing
presented the following documents to the House: a memorial of the convention,
Jan. 11, 1839, setting forth arguments for the admission of the territory, a copy
of the Constitution (these two documents are in NA, HF, 25 Cong., 3 sess.),
a copy of the territorial law relative to the convention, and a copy of the census
of the inhabitants. Five thousand copies of the memorial and other documents
were ordered to be printed, and they are all included in H. Exec. Doc. 206, 27
Cong., 2 sess. The memorial was published contemporaneously in The News
(St. Augustine), Mar. 30, 1839 (the constitution had appeared in the issue of
Feb. 2, 1839), and in The Floridian (Tallahassee), Apr. 6, 1839; it is also printed
in Dodd (ed.), Fla. Becomes a State, pp. 329–333. The Star of Fla. (Tallahassee),
Feb. 28, 1845, contains the constitution, and the Mar. 14 issue states that it was
available in pamphlet form for $.50. It also appears in Fla. (State), Acts, 1845,
pp. 5–26. The constitution was subsequently reprinted in Benjamin Perley
Poore (ed.), The Federal and State Constitutions . . . (Washington, 1878, 2
vols.), I, 317–331, and in Francis N. Thorpe (ed.), The Federal and State Consti-
tutions . . . (Washington, 1909, 7 vols.), II, 664–682. See post, p. 623. The
people of the territory did not vote on the constitution until the election for
delegate was held in May. Gov. Call finally certified to Robert R. Reid, August,
1839, that on the basis of returns received at Tallahassee the vote favored the
constitution 2,070 to 1,975. On Oct. 21, 1839, Reid proclaimed the constitution
approved and ratified by the people (Dodd, ed., op. cit., pp. 69,340; Fla. Terr.
Senate, Journal, 1845, p. 49; Fla. Terr., House, Journal, 1845, p. 41).
In addition to the documentary historical work by Miss Dodd, the statehood
movement in the territory may also be followed in the following publications:
F. W. Hoskins, “The St. Joseph Convention, The Making of Florida's First
Constitution,” Fla. Hist. Quar., XVI, 33–43, 95–109, 242-250, XVII, 125–131;
James B. Whitfield, “Florida's First Constitution,” ibid., XVII, 73–102; and

part governed by, a territory of country possessing a large majority
in numerical strength, and with which they had no association or
business connexion, and have been so disconnected from the Legisla-
ture, and remote from its place of session as to be nearly excluded
from all its benefits.
The Territory that is now attempted to be forced into a State
against our best interests is about 900 miles long, varying in breadth
from 30 to 160 miles; a line drawn through the interior of the country,
equidistant from each border, would exceed 1000 miles in length.
In a new and partially settled country as this is, destitute of roads
and facilities of communication, it is easy to see the immense expense,
trouble and inconvenience which a large portion of the population
must suffer in their business connected with legislation and the
administration of a State Goverment. The burthens that will be
cast upon our people, are truly alarming, and we cannot forbear our
remonstrance in the most unequivocal terms.
Nature never intended that East Florida should be formed into a
State with Middle and West Florida.—Its geographical position pre-
sents an insuperable objection. It is only necessary to cast the eye
over the Map, to see that at no distant day a separation must from
necessity to take place.
At this time, and while we remain a Territory, the process is simple;
erect the whole into a State and the fabrie measure is more intricate,
critical and dangerous, and its accomplishment more tardy and
troublesome.
Suwanee River, situated about one hundred and fifty miles East
of the former line between the two provinces, presents a good and
natural boundary.
It leaves both in the best possible form for States, and would leave
in East Florida about five thousand of the present population of the
Territory.
East Florida would then be about 700 miles long, and its mean
breadth, one hundred and fifty miles. West Florida would then have
about 500, and East Florida 1000 miles of sea coast.
Let it not be supposed that our numbers are too diminutive for
notice. The best and by far the richest portion of this country, has
been under the dominion of the sons of the forest. Their proximity
to other lands not actually occupied by them, made settlements too
dangerous to be multiplied. Remove them, and our numerous
harbours and rivers, the climate, products, and other advantages,
will present too many inducements for this region to remain desolate.
No doubt remains among the intelligent, that in three years our
population would entitle us to a place in the Union.

Neither do we see that Middle or West Florida will have any good
cause to complain. Our population forms at this time so inconsider-
able a portion of the whole, that it cannot very much retard the
attainment of their darling object of becoming a State. By the time
this Constitution shall have been formed, their census taken and their
scheme ready for execution, their increase will probably exceed our
present numbers.
Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray your Honorable body to
pass a law erecting and organizing that portion of Florida which lies
East of the Suwanee River, into a Territory, separate and distinct
from the other parts of the Territory of Florida—and your petitioners,
as in duty bound, will ever pray.”

of that part of West Fla. south of Ala. and west of the Chattahoochee River or

REMONSTRANCE TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF THE

[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[February 10, 1838]
To the Congress of the United States
The undersigned Citizens of Florida respectfully remonstrate against
a new Judicial District, that we understand is proposed to be estab-
lished by act of Congress on the Apalachicola river.”—No such Dis-
trict is necessary and its organization will serve but to increase the
number of officers and of course the expence and will create confusion.
Anticipating the speedy change of our Territorial to a state Govern-
ment we apprehend the creation of an additional number of officers
will add to that influence which may have diliterious influence in
modelling our new Goverment so as to secure the continuance in
power of those who may then be incumbents. We know of no good
reasons to induce the law proposed. Fe° 10th 1838

Middle Florida, instructions were sent to General Jesup," calling his
attention to that part of the Country, and directing him to detach
part of his force for the protection of that portion of the territory—
a copy of this letter is communicated herewith.
It appears from a letter received from Paymaster Massias," that
General Call was charged by Major General Jesup with the defence
of West and Middle Florida, and if this circumstance had been made
known earlier, there would have been no delay in the payment of
these troops—General Call as Governor of Florida has the undoubted
right to call out the Militia to repel hostilities, and to protect the
inhabitants from imminent danger; but this Department has no
authority to pay troops so called out without the sanction of Congress.
If the Governor had been vested with the authority to call out troops
by this Department, then their payment follows as a matter of
course—If he had been authorised to do so by the Major General
commanding, to whom the defence of Florida is entrusted, there
would have been no necessity to recur to this Department, as that
General ought to have ordered the payment to be made immediately—
but when troops are called out by Governors of States or territories
without other authority than the circumstances of the case furnish,
the previous sanction of Congress is necessary to authorize this de-
partment to pay them.
Major General Jesup left a large force in his rear for the protection
of the frontiers of Middle Florida—Properly distributed, it is deemed
to be amply sufficient for that purpose. If it shall appear to him
not to be so, he is instructed to authorise Governor Call to raise a
force for that purpose.
It would be injurious to the service in the opinion of the Department,
to give direct authority to any other than the Commanding General
to provide for the defence of the Territory of Florida."

SIR I have contracted with Thomas Ritchie Esq. of Richmond Wa

is not a single copy in my office. I wish to obtain your permission to
visit Richmond Wa in April for the purpose of complying with the
act of Congress in relation to this matter. The work cannot be done
here if it can be done at all for less than double its cost at the North:

by Mineral Springs to Tallahassee, and $10,000 for opening a road from Talla-

several persons, about twenty miles from that place, and that there

We the undersigned planters of Jackson county understand that

We are of opinion that several thousand dollars remain unexpended
and respectfully request that you will apply to the Secretary of War
and ask that he will direct the balance to be expended under the
direction of Maj. Graham of the Top. Engineers in cutting out and
removing the Natural Bridge—an obstruction of four or five hundred
yards, occupying the whole river and over which high waters flow.
By reference to the map of the Territory you will perceive the locality
of said obstruction—If this were removed the river would be rendered
navigable for many miles rendering most of the richest land in the
county convenient to navigation, as it lies above the said Bridge.

SIR, Upwards of six hundred Indians and negroes have come in,
and I expect daily accessions to their numbers.
On the 1* instant I sent an expedition to the head of New River
under Major Lauderdale; * and I have since sent a force under Lt
Col° Bankhead" to Key Biscayne, to enter the Everglades, should it
be necessary to do so, in order to force the Indians who have sought
refuge there to surrender. I have ordered that the Indians be attacked
if they fail or refuse to come in.”
Br Gen' Eustis " has been detached to the North frontier of the
Territory to provide for its security; for it has been recently ascertained
that about the time the Cherrokee force closed, the Miccasukeys broke
up into small bands and dispersed themselves along the Wethlocoochee,
the lower Ocklewaha, and the Waccasassa; and the Tallahassees went

to the Annustaliga." Sam Jones retreated South with about eighty
warriors, but the greater part of them were fugitive Creeks. The
Indians are now spread over more than five degrees of latitude in
small bands of from five to fifty men women & children. Their object
is to hide and elude us until the approach of the sickly season shall
compel us to withdraw the troops from the interior.
Colonel Taylor has established a post on the Okeechobee, and has
detached Major Loomis,” with a hundred & fifty men in boats to
endeavour to find the outlet from that Lake into the Pahāi-Okee.
More than a hundred of the Indians now in the vicinity of this
Camp had for more than a month been between Colonel Taylor's force
and mine, so intirely concealed by the Swamps, that no trace of them
could be discovered. Col" Taylor pursued a considerable force re-
cently—they disappeared, and we now learn that they are on the
Western side of the Okeechobee. There are no means of finding or
concentrating the Indians, except by messengers of peace. If they
could be once collected, I have no doubt many might be induced to
emigrate, whose relations have already gone to the West: but, dis-
bursed as they are at present, it would require at least two or three
months to assemble them.
The difficulty of obtaining supplies at this post, (they have to be
brought in small boats more than half the distance from Indian river
Inlet,) will probably compel me to abandon it, and either go down to
New River, or fall back to Fort Pearce. I will endeavour to hold on,
however, until all the Indians South of this point & north of New
River be brought in.

[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., J 62:LS] -
HEAD QUARTERS, Army of the South,
Camp near Fort Jupiter, March 14. '38
SIR, Six hundred and forty two Indians and negroes have come in to
this post, and I have directed that about a hundred more who were
on their way hither from the swamp of the Okeechobee, assemble at
Fort M*Rea 1" on that lake.
With one of the parties that lately came in was a nephew of Aligator:
him I have sent on a message to that chief, who, I have ascertained,
is now west of the Okeechobee with his people; and who is represented
as desirous of peace. I have authorized him to send his people to one
of the posts on the Coloosehatchie, and have invited him to meet me
here—If he come, I have great hopes of securing his influence in favour
of emigration.
If it be found impossible to emigrate any considerable body of the
Indians, I shall in the absence of instructions, assign them a district
for their residence, and let them know that the treaty for their removal
is not to be changed, but that its operation is merely suspended, and
that it will be enforced on the slightest depredations being committed
by any one of any of the bands of Indians composing the Nation—thus
holding the whole accountable for the conduct of each individual. I
would not advise the Government to go farther than this: and on a
careful consideration of the powers with which I am invested, I con-
sider that I have the right to make such an arrangement. By no other
than peaceful means can the Indians, dispersed as they now are over
more than five degrees of latitude, ever be concentrated—if it should
occupy the whole season to concentrate them, and another season to
remove them, or to induce them to remove, the measure would still be
the best that could be adopted—two, or at most three, regiments,
with the knowledge we have of the country, would be sufficient not
only to concentrate them, but ultimately to remove them.
Under no circumstances would I advise the assembling of a large
Army again in Florida–Under no circumstances, if the measure above
suggested be adopted, can it be necessary—By disease, capture, and
battle, the Seminoles and Miccasukeys including their negroes have
lost, since the commencement of the War, more than five hundred
warriors—those that remain have lost all their property except their
rifles, and are now fugitives, without a home or a resting place. If
they continue hostile, even fifty of their number may be extremely
troublesome to the frontier as much so as the whole body, and much
more difficult to follow and find.

It has been said that the national honor forbids any compromise
with them—can there be a point of honor between a great nation and
a band of naked savages, now beaten, broken, dispirited and dis-
persed? I think those who believe so form a very low estimate of
national honor. But admit that our national honor could be tarnished
by giving up the contest entirely, and forming a new treaty with
different provisions from those of the existing treaty—we are surely at
liberty, without compromising our honor, to adopt those measures
whether of direct hostility or of policy which shall promise the greater
probability of ultimate success.
If the Indians were concentrated and allowed to make a single
crop, and at the same time all trade with them in arms and ammunition
were prohibited and prevented, they would soon demand removal:
and a single regiment stationed within striking distance of their posi-
tion, could at any time compel them to remove. The Government
surely would make no sacrifice of national honor by granting the boon
of one or two years residence to the Seminoles, on a tract of land, and
within limits designated and defined by its own agents
The Seminoles have been as completely beaten, both in the last
compaign and the present, as they were beaten by General Jackson.
They have been pursued farther, and more dispersed, more of them
have been killed, and more prisoners have been taken. They have
been as completely beaten as the Western Indians were by General
Wayne or General Harrison—and were I permitted to make a treaty
on the terms on which those Generals treated, permanent peace could
be secured in a week. I, as well as my predecessors in command in
Florida, have failed to catch and remove the Seminoles to Arkansas;
but it should be remembered that we are the only commanders who
have ever been required to go into an unexplored wilderness, catch
savages, and remove them to another wilderness. Search all history
and another instance is not to be found. To beat the whole body
of the Indians six hundred regular troops have at any period of the
War been sufficient—twenty thousand would not be able to catch
them. To persevere in the course we have been pursuing for three
years past would be a reckless waste of blood and treasure; and I
sincerely hope that I may soon receive instructions to adopt the course
I have recommended, or if I should act without instructions, that my
measures be approved *—and I have the honor to be, with most
respectful consideration, Sir, Your Obt. Servt.

H. R. W. ANDREWS TO THE SECRETARY
OF THE TREASURY
[NA:TD, ST Lets, from Land Offices:ALS]
TALLAHASSEE April 5" 1838
SIR I am informed through the Receiver of this place that charges
have been prefered by John G. Gamble Esq against his official conduct
also implicating myself in the following manner “It is matter of
complaint that Citizens have applied to enter Lands—their money
was refused—and after having converted their Bank Notes into Land
office money, upon another application for Land, they have found it
entered by the Receiver or by his clerk H R W Andrews” This
Charge is incorrect, if such complaints have been made they were
without any foundation whatever, I have been engaged as Clerk for
the Register for the last two years during which time I have made
several entries in my own name and in company with M J Allen but
in no instance have either of us entered Land that had been applied
for, although applications are made almost daily for Lands without
the applicants completing their entries, The course pursued in the
Registers office in regard to the issuing of Applications is, to issue only
one application for the same piece of Land on the same day, Should
the Applicant fail to complete the entry before Nine Oclock the next
morning then the same Land is subject to be entered by any other
person, during the time I have been in the Registers office No Person
has been refused an Application for Land subject to entry. Where
Application has been made for the entry of Lands and the Applicant
failed to complete the entry in proper time I conceive D* Allen or
myself have a right to enter the same Land, Although cases of this
kind occur almost daily we or either of us have in no instance inter-
fered with Applicants in this manner.
The Tallahassee Bank Bills were received in payment for land and
recognised as Specie according to a distinct understanding between
the Receiver and the officers of both Banks (as I was informed by the
Receiver prior and subsequent to the suspension of Specie payment)
until about the 5" or 10" of May last at which time the Union Bank
of Florida suspended Specie payment, and Mr R B Copeland who was
then Clerk for the Receiver during his absence to Mobile for the pur-
pose of making a deposit, received the Union Bank Bills at par for a
few days after its suspension.
Mr J G Gambles charge must apply subsequent to the Union Banks
suspension as the exchange of money was unnecessary before, By
reference to the returns at the General Land office from this district
which have been forwarded up to the 1* inst. you will not find an

say with truth that I have in any manner entered Land in my own
name—in company with any person or persons, procured or permitted
any person or persons whatsoever to enter Land for me, or purchased
Land from any person since the suspension by the Union Bank, On
examination of the entries during the same period I find M J Allen

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY JAMES GADSDEN
[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess. ADS]
[Referred April 9, 1838]
To The Senate & House of Representatives in Congress assembled—
At the late session of the Legislative Council of the Territory of
Florida, I had the honor of submitting to that body a Project of a Rail
Road to connect the waters of the Atlantic with those of the Gulf of
Mexico *—Though the object was deemed not exclusively local, but
general in its character, bearing with like benefit upon the commercial
interests of the whole union, as upon the Territory through which the
Road was to pass; I selected the action of the Legislative Council, in
the first instance as probably more sure, and certainly as most speedy,
to give impulse to the work contemplated—There was not a dissenting
voice, I believe in either the Council or the community, as to the
great importance of the Rail Road connection which had been sug-
gested-Disagreement of opinion however, as to the measures neces-
sary to carry out the problem, led to a suspension, for the time, of all
Legislative action in the Territory on the subject—The Resources of
Florida were not, at this crisis considered equal to the undertaking;
Private enterprise though encouraged by a charter had faltered, if not
failed, and the proposal to permit the Union Bank of Florida, assisted
* See post, p. 502.
* For this purpose the Legislative Council on Feb. 8, 1838, incorporated the
Florida Peninsula Railroad and Steamboat Co. (Fla., Terr., Acts, 1838, pp. 27–32).

by the credit of the Territory, to build up the road, seems not to have
met with sufficient approbation to secure the Agency of that institu-
tion—Believing as I do that the project is viewed with a most favour-
able eye by all who have directed their attention to the subject—;
That it is one in which the commercial interests, as well as the military
& naval protection of the country is much involved, I have presumed
to bring it before the Congress of the U States, under a confident hope
that some action on their part may be obtained at the present session
sufficient to give impulse to the design, and to strengthen the public
confidence in its commercial importance & practicability—
It would be superfluous to enlarge on the benefits of the project—
A mere inspection of the map will exhibit the facilities, for rapid and
certain intercourse, it will present between the Two great sections
of the U.S. the Atlantic & Gulf Frontier—
The circuitous navigation of the dangerous coasts & keys of Florida
may be thus avoided, and the Two Great Emporiums of American
commerce New Orleans & New York, be brough from 4 to 5 days nearer
to Each other—Whether therefore we consider, the shortning the dis-
tance between two extremes of the U States; the great facilities pre-
sented for the rapid transportation of the mails, Troops armamements
of war &c &c, and the additional security offered to Travellers & goods
by a conveyance exempt from the circuitous & dangerous voyage
around the Cape of Florida: they all with our imposing influence
recommend to the serious attention of Congress, the importance of a
High Way of Rails from the Atlantic to the Gulf Waters—
It is well known what expenditures have been encurred by Govern-
ment & what examinations have been made to effect the same object
by a Canal & had the Report of the Engineers been favourable as to
its practicability, an intercourse across the Peninsula of Florida might
long since have been secured—on the practicability of the proposed
Rail Road there is no doubt—
The partial examinations which have been made have resulted most
favourably as to the character of the ground, & the facilities which the
Country affords in materials &c—Most of the distance will be a plane,
and no inequalities of the interposing country can possibly present
inclinations beyond the easy performance of Locomotive Power—
Could Congress therefore be induced, at this session, to make an appro-
priation for a survey & location of the Route of a Road from the Gulf
to the Atlantic, and pass an act granting to any company, which may
be incorporated, the right of way & a certain extent of ground on each
side for the road through the Public Domain; it would so strengthen
& encourage the public confidence in the project, that little doubt
would remain, but that at our next session of the Legislative Council
of Florida, impulse & organisation would be given to some action, by

HIS EXCELLENCY R. K. CALL Governor of Florida. Tallahassee, Flor-

SIR, Within the last two or three months, the Department has
several times, received intelligence of depredations committed by the
Indians in Middle Florida, and has called the attention of General
Jesup to them, and given particular directions for the defence of that
portion of the territory. Recent information of further depredations,
render it necessary that some further steps should be taken, and I
have the honor to inform you that, the Commanding Officer in Florida
has this day been written to, and directed to send an Officer of rank
and intelligence, to that section, with such part of the regular force
as can be spared, for the purpose of preventing a repetition of these
depredations, and, if possible, to capture or destroy the lawless
marauders who commit them. The regular force that this Officer
may be able to take with him, may not be sufficient for the accom-
plishment of the objects in view, and it may therefore be necessary
for him to apply to your Excellency for a portion of the Militia to
aid him. In this event, I am instructed by the President to request
that you will place at his disposal, such an amount of force of this
description, as he may require, to serve three months, unless sooner
discharged.”

SIR I feel it but justice to myself to address you, on the subject of
certain charges made against me (as Receiver) by John G. Gamble.
I will commence by exposing what (in my opinion) were the true
motives of Col° Gamble in becoming my accuser, and firstly he is a
violent opponent of the present administration as he was of that of
General Jackson, where as, I have been its uniform supporter, since
the commencement of Gen' Jacksons first administration, and contrib-
uted my mite to his first election. Secondly, he is irritated with me
for the free expression of my opinions, of the violated pledge of the
officers of the Union bank of Florida (of which he is president) to pay
in Specie or its equivalent my deposits made with them prior to suspen-
sion. Thirdly, he made a proposition to me throug a third person
(some time prior to the date of his charges) to transfer to the Union
bank all the Specie received at the Land office in exchange for Treasury
notes, and I suppose was irritated at my refusal. And lastly he is
desirous of Substituting for me (as Receiver) M. Copeland * brother
in law of John Parkhill Esqr the latter cashier of the Union bank, who
is also a warm opponent of the Administration, and who I am informed
(Unofficially) is an applicant for the appointment should a vacancy
OCCul".
I would draw your attention briefly to the charges of M" Gamble,
and to my refutation of them, I have divided those charges into
three, First my having exacted an onerous and oppressive discount
on the bank note currency of the country, from persons entering
lands; for a refutation of this charge. I refer you to the statements
enclosed in my letter to M'. Woodbury of the 17" Ult.* and to the
certificate of M*Andrews date the 5" instant * and enclosed in my
letter to Mr Woodbury of the 19* * (to the truth of which I could
obtain abundant other testimony if deemed requisite. For a refutation
of the 2" charge concerning my entry of lands previously applied for
(of which I feel myself wholly incapable, and which if true you would
not find me attempting a defence) I refer you to my statements
mentioned above, to the letter of Mess" Andrews & Hackley to M*
Woodbury of the 5" enclosed in my letter to the later of the 19* inst.,
and to the returns from my office to the Commissioner of the G.L.

to the suspension of Specie payments, and when I was receiving the
currency of Tallahassee at par with the exception of one quarter

by the letter Mess" Andrews & Hackley (referred to above. And

time of making their entries) that I would return it on their paying
me Government funds, and that I am perfectly willing now to do so.—
I feel much more indignant at the attempt to injure my character,
(which has been sustained to the age of 38 without blemish) than at
that to effect my removal from office, and would respectfully refer
you to the recommendations which induced your predecessior in office
to confer on me the appointment.”

TO THE HONBLE JOHN FORSYTH Secratary of State
SIR Since my acceptance of the Office of Marshall of the Western
District of Florida,” I have been informed by Col Charles Downing
that it is expected & required of me by the President of the United
States, that I should retire from my situation as Editor of the St.
Joseph Times I have to say Sir, that I expect personally & by Deputy
faithfully & fully to discharge the duties of my office, but it is also
due to myself to inform you that its emoluments are insufficient, un-
connected with any other business, to meet the ordinary expenses of a
man of family—I must rely upon something beside the Marshalship
for a support—and can see no good reason why an interdict should be
pronounced against my professin as an Editor, The paper under my
controul is of a commercial character, most of my subscribers are
opposed to the administration, & tho I am and have been its advocate,
in all that I thought right yet my course has been of a character to
exempt me from the charge of partizanship—Apart from the injustice,
on general principles, of requiring me to abandon a pursuit with
which my pecuniary interests are involved, I would respectfully sug-
gest that the probable change in our local government within twelve
or eighteen months will render the office of Marshall entirely value-
less—In fact it may be abolished—And if I am compelled to meet the
wishes of the President on this subject at the expiration of twelve
months I may find myself without office & my interest in my present
establishment gone—
It has been suggested to me that I might continue as Editor of my
paper by placing some one nominally at its head—but this would be
an evasion of the wish intimated by the President and a concealment
of that which (if wrong at all) should not be practiced
I shall govern myself Sir by your reply to this communication "

SIR, I am instructed by the Secretaly of War to inform you that,
General Jesup has recently forwarded to the Department a petition of
certain Fishermen,” employed by, or connected with, Captain William
Bunce, by whom they have been concentrated on an Island in the bay
of Tampa. The object of the petition is to obtain the revocation of an
order given by General Jesup, that their wives and families, who it
appears are of Indian blood, and members of the Seminole tribe,
should, because thereof, be sent to New Orleans to be transported with

others on their way to the West. The General, in his letter trans-
mitting the petition, has given his reasons for taking this measure,
which satisfies the Department of its policy, and it must, therefore, be
persisted in, at least, for the present.
The return of the families in question, may become a subject of
future consideration; but, until a final pacification of the territory,
they must remain away; and it would be better for the peace of the
country, if the petitioners would accompany them. The tenor of this
communication you are requested to communicate to Captain Bunce.
I transmit you a copy of General Jesup's letter above mentioned,
from which you will perceive that, he suspects the fishermen alluded
to, of improper conduct, and the propriety of keeping a watchful eye
upon them."

SIR, I now proceed to answer your several letters of January 25th,"
March 12th " & 13th 1838,” and at the same time, to communicate
to you the views of the Department respecting your future proceedings
in regard to the Appalachicolas.
The Secretary of War is of the opinion, that under the existing
treaty, the United States can pay these Indians for the portion of their
reserves still retained only in proportion to the amount stipulated
to be paid for the whole; and that if they accede to this, they will be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the treaty with the Seminols
of 1832." These have been communicated to you, and you will
therefore be prepared to explain them to the Appalachicolas, and
ascertain their determination. This is the only proposition the
government can now make to them, and it is for them to decide
whether they will accept it or, in view of the removal of the majority
of the Seminoles, take the alternative of remaining subject to the laws
of Florida, without an annuity, without claim on the care and pro-

tection of the general government, and with no means of support
but the proceeds of the balance of their reserves, and the residue
of the annuity, then to be advanced to them. This is plainly stated,
not for intimidation or coercion, but simply because it is the literal
meaning and scope of the treaty. It is believed however, that admit-
ting, for the moment, that the cession of their lands and their removal
may be considered by them as hardships, yet that their eventual and
permanent prosperity will be promoted thereby. The experience of the
Creeks and Seminoles, who have emigrated, put this matter beyond
question. Whatever conclusion they may arrive at, it should be the
result of their free deliberation and action. I do not think a prelimi-
nary exploration of the country beyond the Mississippi necessary,
even if there were means applicable to the expenses. Its character
and capabilities are so well known, as to warrant the assurance that
the lands assigned them, are well suited to their wants and pursuits.
You will lose no time in bringing this subject before them and reporting
their decision.
A copy of your report on the case of the Slaves of Econchatimicco"
has been sent to Congress, for such action as that body may deem
proper.
Under date of April 20th, M. Smith wrote " that the person, to
whom you directed him to turn over the public property, had refused
to receive it, and had left that vicinity. I presume you will have
adopted the necessary measures in this contingency under the authority
heretofore given you.
The annuity will be permitted for payment as early as practicable
after the appropriation is made.”

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY INHABITANTS OF EAST
FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 2 sess.:DS]
[Referred May 21, 1838]
To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled
The Petition of the undersigned inhabitants of East Florida most
respectfully represents That the inhabitants and others who are
desirous of entering lands in said District are subjected to great
expence & inconvenience from the location of the Land Office at
St Augustine
This City is situated at a great distance from the part of the Country
in which lands are the property of the United States and subject
to entry
Your Petitioners believe that it will be found correct when they
state that not one acre out of a thousand is public land that is situated
East of the River St Johns; and the country bordering said River
on its Western Bank from the mouth to its head, is entirely covered
by old claims, derived from grants from the British and Spanish
Governments, and therefore not subject to entry as public land
The establishment of the land Office therefore at St Augustine
operates as a grievous tax on the inhabitants of the Counties of
Alachua, Columbia and Hillsborough, who are compelled to travel
from One to two hundred miles to make the most trifling entry
Your Petitioners are informed that the practice universally adopted
in the Western States is to locate the land office in the centre (as near
as can be done) of the lands subject to entry and sale
They therefore most respectfully request that this subject may be
taken into consideration by the National Congress, and that the land

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
12" instant," expressing your readiness to comply with the requisition
made upon you, by direction of the President, for such Militia force
as the Officer, charged with the defence of Middle Florida, may find
it necessary to call for; advisory of the flight of the Creek Indians
assembled for emigration to the West; of the consequent alarm of the
citizens; and of the measures you have taken for their protection, con-
sisting of the employment of a portion of the Militia, and of the
Apalachicola Indians. These measures, you express a wish, may be
approved by the Department, under the impression, it is presumed,
that such approval will legally entitle the troops, so employed, to
compensation from the United States.
The laws relating to the employment of the Militia and volunteers,
prohibit the payment of any by the Government, except those regu-
larly mustered into, or out of, the Service of the United States, under
directions from the President, the Secretary of War, or a general
Officer of the regular Army; so that the formal approval by the De-
partment, of the measures alluded to, would not effect the object, for
which it is inferred, you desire it.
The only way, therefore, in which the Department could legally
bind itself for the payment of the troops in question would be to have
mustered into the service, those still employed, and to have mustered
out, those who have been dismissed, if they would assemble for that

BREVET BRIG GENERAL Z. TAYLOR. Tampa Bay, Florida.
SIR, Letters have been received from Governor Call, informing the
Department, that there have been some disturbances in West Florida,
and that he has therefore, called into service, a militia force—In reply
he has been informed that, the defence of Florida has been entrusted to
you, and that he must address all applications in relation to that sub-
ject, to head quarters—There appears to exist a disposition on the part
of the Militia of Florida, to rush into the service—No doubt their
motives are highly laudable: but the gratification of their wishes must
be governed by the exigency of the service, and the means at our
disposal—The estimates and appropriations, if they be made, are all
based upon a diminution of the expenses of this war. The number of
mounted men, must be very much reduced, and the whole Militia
force ought not to exceed one thousand men. The law under which
the Executive is authorized to employ volunteers, expired on the 1"
of May last, and those now in service, must be put on the footing of
drafted Militia, until the passage of an act, renewing the power. No
volunteers, therefore, can be received into the service, and whatever
additional force you may require, must be raised by drafts on the
Militia, according to law.
General Jesup states that, you will require a Sea Steamer. If so,
you had better place the Poinsett on the duty, for which it will be
wanted, as I am desirous to avoid the additional expense of purchasing,
or freighting another Sea Steamer.

HIS EXCELLENCY R. K. CALL Governor of Florida. Tallahassee,
Florida.
SIR, I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 20" ultimo,”
and its enclosures, on the subject of the appearance of Indians in
West Florida; of the fears of the inhabitants, of depredations from
them, and of their desire to be protected by a Military force.
From your letter it appears that, your Excellency is still under a
misapprehension as to the power of the Department to make provision
for the subsistence and payment of Militia called out by you for the
defence of Florida. This is not a matter in which the Department
can exercise its discretion, it being limited to making provision for
the maintainance of those troops only, which are regularly mustered
into the service, and for the payment of those so mustered into, or out
out of, the service, under directions from the President, the Secretary
of War, or a General Officer of the United States Army. It is still
further restricted by the want of means to provide for but a very
limited force, as it is with the greatest difficulty that appropriations
can be obtained of Congress for even the smallest possible amount
of force necessary for the execution of its duty of protecting the
inhabitants of Florida and elsewhere. Hence the necessity of vesting
the calling out of troops, and taking other measures, involving expense
for the defence of Florida, only in the general in Command there.
Ample authority has been given to General Taylor, to take every
measure in his power, to afford protection to the inhabitants of that
territory, as you have already been advised, and it would save time
and risk, if, in all exigencies of the kind, presented in your letter, you
would apply to him for the necessary force; when he could either
regularly raise additional force, so that it could be maintained and
paid without difficulty by the United States, or more to the point
when it is required, a portion of that already in service, and thus
save the heavy expense of employing new troops.
Immediately on the receipt of your letter yesterday, General Taylor
was advised of the grounds for apprehending disturbances in West
Florida, and he will, without doubt, take such measures in reference
thereto, as the circumstances may require.

would not, in their necessities, aid them until their removal with a
Small allowance of Meats, and bread Stuff.
In preperation of their final removal in the fall they desire that their
children in Kentucky may be Sent to them immediately.
You will oblige me in your reply to be minute in relation to my
further proceedings with these people, and to inform me when their
annuity may be expected; the manner of disposing of it; and when
they may expect the money agreed to be paid them for their land. In
the deeds you will perceive the 20" October next is the time mentioned
for the payment of this money, but I presume the Government will
advance it before that time, particularly when their Situation is
considered."

SIR, It is highly necessary that I should visit Washington during
the summer for the purpose of settling my accounts with the Govern-
ment, many of which have been standing open, for several years. I
propose leaving this in the early part of next month. The Government
of the Territory during my absence will necessarily devolve on the
Secretary M. J. P. Duval, and it is important that he should remain
at the seat of Government, in order to discharge the duties of the
Executive Department. Having absented himself from this place on
the 11" Ultimo without apprising me of his intention, I have to
request that he may be ordered to return forthwith and remain here
during my absence. I have received no communication from him on
the subject, but I have learned from others, that he has gon with his
family to S" Joseph, where it is his intention to spend the summer.
For the discharge of the duties of his office, his residence might as well
be at Boston or New-York as at the place he has selected. The people

SIR I should have replied to your communication of the 12* of
February "last on the subject of the memorial from S* Augustine
concerning certain alleged errors in the surveys on the S" Johns river
&c, but in the midst of the great press of other business on this Office
during the late session of congress, it was filed with the other papers
with a view of taking up the whole subject as soon as practicable
after the adjournment of congress
The documents which accompanied your former communications *
as also a report from the Register & Receiver," have yet to be care-
fully examined, and I am therefore unable to express an opinion at
this time, or to give any further directions than those which have
already been issued, requiring the Register & Receiver to withhold
all the lands from sale or entry which will probably be covered by
the claims when surveyed
As regards the empression which you seem to have been under,

intended as an attack upon your standing as a public officer, I can
assure you that this office has not so regarded them, and the phrase
“gross errors” to which you take so much exception, was employed
in my letter, not as a quotation from M Lytle's letter, but in con-
formity with the language used in memorial, which represents that
“great errors” exist in the surveys “and describes private claims
containing from ten to seventeen thousand acres as having been
surveyed as public land
I am confident that you do the principal clerk in this office great
injustice, by supposing that he has been in minute correspondence
with Col. Andrews or any other person, on the subject of your official
duties. M. Moore to whom a communication from Col. Andrews is
promised in M* Lytle's letter having some acquaintance with Col.
Andrews one of the old residents in this City (as I learn) & Col. A.
Being a total stranger to me, is the natural, & doubtless the only
reason for his addressing himself particularly to M* Moore. I am
entirely satisfied that no letter on this subject had passed from M*
Moore to Col. Andrews whose letter was immediately turned over
to the office as an official matter—
I cheerfully inclose according to your request, a copy of Col.
Andrews letter to Mr Moore dated 27 Jan’ last " (being all the cor-
respondence alluded to by you) from the post script to which you
will also perceive, that he disclaims any intention to impute blame
to the surveyors—
It is regretted that the claimants omitted (as explained in your
report) to come forward on the ground at the proper time, so as to
enable the Deputies to survey their claims, and I am sure you will
concur with me in the opinion, that the evil cannot be too soon
corrected, by applying such remidies as the case after a careful
examination may be found to admit, in which your cordial aid &
cooperation is expected
In reply to your remark that it appears from M Lytles letter,
that both he & Col. Andrews are officers of the Gen" government,
and to your request that I would advise you what are their relative
stations—I have to state that I know nothing of the matter except
what is disclosed in their communications referred to *

your Office has not regarded either the memorial or letters from St
Augustine" as an attack upon my standing as a public Officer, and
when you shall have fully examined the subject, you will readily
believe, that my Deputy Surveyors have faithfully executed their
instructions by cutting down Frauds and, otherwise surveying all
claims that were identified sufficiently by owners or agents to render
their location practicable, and on this particular branch of the subject,
the decision of the Land Commission, approved by the Department
and embodied as a quotation in my special instructions referred to
as on file in your Office will carry conviction to the mind of Col
Andrews or any other person, that his statement does them very great
injustice, in direct opposition to the PS attached to his letter of 27"
Jan' last to M* Moore." I do not hesitate to assert, from what I
have heard and seen, that a large portion of the private claims origi-
nally surveyed (and many pretended surveys subsequent to the issuing
of the grants) contain within their limits some 100 some 50 or less per
cent over the amount of what the grants call for, and hence they refuse
to have their Grants run out. I have been the subject of proposition
for accomodation from that quarter of Florida. I feel my integrity
in arms against every intimation that squints towards me, and in the
papers of the Aredondo Report referred to, my Deputy proved himself
beyond the power of accomodation from his shewing. Another
attempt was made to furnish one of my Deputies with a legal opinion
contravening his instructions, which he unfortunately refused to
receive, as it would be no doubt very edifying to the Department.
Col Andrews seems to think my Deputies were not to blame because
“they went according to the best lights they had at the time”. Those
lights are found in the General & Special Instructions, with particular
charges to perform their duty faithfully, and if any further light could
have been given them under the laws and my instructions, I would
have felt myself indebted to Col° Andrews, or to any other person for
a knowledge of it. They were at least furnished with sufficient light,
approved by the Department, to protect the Government from great
impositions
On the subject of remedy, I would most earnestly and respectfully
suggest, that innumerable difficulties will ensue if this country is again
thrown open for resurvey; for private claims will be springing into
existence through the Judiciary for years to come, and the only proper
salvo that has occurred to my mind, would be found in an Act of
Congress, providing for the location in one body when practicable of
each grant not surveyed, to include the improvements (if any) and

confined to the lines of the public surveys as already run; and where
that it is impracticable so to locate the whole amount of the claim,
the residue to be located on lands of the U States within-miles at the
selection of the claimants and if not agreed to on their parts, that under
a constitutional provision, their lands be taken for public use at valua-
tion under sworn non resident appraisers. These suggestions are
given you for what they may be worth, and I believe the Government
would stand justified from the failure of the claimants to have their
lands run out as provided for by the Acts of Congress under the Treaty,
and the instructions founded thereon, with the repeated notices
furnished from this Office. M Graham proposed to Congress at my

subject of your remark relative to M' Moore that I “do the principal
Clerk of this Office great injustice, by supposing that he has been in
private correspondence with Col° Andrews &c”; will you be kind
enough to read my letter and see whether my expression is not as

he says “Col" Andrews will write to Mr Moore fully on the subject I
could get the whole town to sign the memorial, but I am satisfied that

Sir you have set this equivocal language upon a sure foundation, & I
would be the last man on earth to withold from you or Mr Moore, the
withdrawal of any expression founded on misconception, and I tender
you my thanks for the opportunity. I wait with composure your
final opinion on my Report, conscious of my integrity in the perform-

GOVERNOR CALL TO ZACHARY TAYLOR
[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., T 228:C1]
TALLAHASSEE 21" August. 1838
SIR, The deep interest I feel in the termination of the War with
the Seminole Indians, and the length of time through which it has
been protracted, induces me to address you on the subject, and to
offer such suggestion for its future prosecution, as has been presented
to my view, from an attentive observation of its whole progress.
It is now nearly three years since the commencement of this harassing,
and disastrous conflict, and although many battles have been fought,
and many of the enemy have been killed or captured, a force still
remains which from the nature of the Country no less than from the
character of the Enemy forbids the hope that it will terminate under
the present system, without yet a long and continued struggle, a
cost increased, in the loss of life, and expenditure of the public Treas-
ure. In the progress of this War our best Generals and our best
appointed arms have been employed with little success, though all
has been done which skills, energy and untiring perseverance could
accomplish. The object which ever sought has not been obtained.
So far from removing the Indians from the land of their Nativity,
our froniter Settlements have receded before the fire and sword of
the Enemy, and his dominion has been extended over a large scope
of Country, from which the white man has been expelled. The
destruction of the houses and other property of our citizens has
caused them to retire further into the interior of the Settlements to
seek for shelter and for subsistence. They cannot like the savage
feed on roots, and game, with no other covering than the heavens
to shelter them. Such too is the situation of our soldiers, without
the food to which they have been accustomed, they are unable to
perform service. Their supplies are procured from a distance, and
are carried into the interior with great difficulty and expense. The
most secure hiding places of the enemy, cannot be penetrated except
on foot, hence the provision of the soldier must be conveyed in his
knapsack, and when his supply is exhausted, he is compelled to retire
from want of food, leaving the enemy in his undisturbed possession of
his native fortresses. It is not from numbers, superior bravery, or
skill in the use of Arms, that the Seminole has thus long been enabled
to resist our power, but from the nature of the country which he
inhabits—The difficulty of procuring supplies for our Army—The
effect of the climate on his pursuers, and his act [art?] and success in
evading pursuit. Experience has taught him that he has only to avoid
battle, and the best, and the most numerous and best appointed

army conducted with all the skill and energy necessary for success,
will be exhausted and subdued by the fatigues and privations of the
march. Secure in his ability to avoid pursuit, the passage of our
Army through his country, exists but little apprehension. He knows
that from want of supplies, it must soon retire, leaving him again
indisputed master of the field. He has already experienced every
calamity, but the loss of life. His nation has been broken and bis-
bursed into small fugitive bands, his villages and houses have been
burned, his fields laid waste, his cattle destroyed. But the ravages
of War has left him an unsubdued wanderer, armed for destruction—
Every swamp, and every hammock gives him shelter, and gives him
food. The wild potatoe, the wild Arrow-root, the Cabbage Tree,
Palmetto and the Briar root, every where abounds
From most of these flour is extracted by a simple process, which
furnishes an wholesome and nutritious food. The woods furnish
him with game and the waters with an exhaustable, supply of fish.
Hence, want and famine the attendant consequences of invasion in
every other country, and with every other people has no terrors for
him; The spontaneous products of nature supply him with abun-
dant and congenial means of subsistence, the Swamps and hammocks
are his barriers of defence, and while he flies before invasion, his
subtle stelth and cunning, enables him to surprise the unsuspecting
traveller, and to visit the frontier settler with destruction, when
least expected, then he is most to be feared. And now after a san-
guinary conflict of near three years, after our Army has swept over
every portion of the Enemy's Country, and every house and village
has been destroyed, there is not a family along our whole line of
settlements, for than more two hundred miles in extent, that is not
nightly exposed to destruction, and scarcely a week passes by, with-
out adding to the long and melancholy list of those who have perished
by the hands of the savage.
My observation on the result of the measure heretofore pursued
for the removal of the Indians, have brought me forcibly to the con-
clusion, that it cannot be accomplished without a change of policy,
so long as the Indians are determined to resist—It is not by the march
or countermarch of Armies through the Enemy's country, that he is
to be expelled, for he has only to conceal himself for a few days,
and the Army exhausted with fatigue and hunger, retires before him
without the fire of a gun. The forest must be subdued before the
Enemy can be finally conquered. Every inch of ground taken from
him must be firmly held by permanent settlers, who will cultivate
the soil, and make the wilderness their home, Under this system
there is every reason to believe that the Savage would gradually
retire before the approach of the civilized man. that he would be

compelled to abandon every portion of the country which is suscep-
table of cultivation, and if he should still seek shelter in the barren
waste and inhospitable everglades, the production of the soil of the
interior would furnish an abundant supply for the Army at conven-
ient points, while operating against him. For the purpose of carry-
ing this plan into execution, I would respectfully suggest the expe-
diency of locating Military colonies, under the Superintendence of
the Comm" General, on all the public lands of the Peninsula, where
the body is sufficiently large to support a population capable of
defending itself against the inroads of the Enemy, each colony or
Settlement in the first instance should be located in a healthy posi-
tion, and in villages. The houses to be constructed in such a man-
ner as to give and receive mutual defence and protection to each
other. The men should be required to perform Military duty,
within certain limits, and for the first year, or so long as their safety
may demand it, they should be required to cultivate in common,
and a portion of them, to be constantly prepared for defence. During
the first Year of the Colonists who should join the Colony, and enroll
themselves with the Comm"Officer, on or before a day certain, and
continue to perform his duty faithfully, should be entitled to receive
Pay and rations as a Soldier in the army—They should be subject
in every respect to the rules and Articles of War, and be liable to
be tried by a court Martial, for insubordination, or other offences.
And after two years habitation, and cultivation, or the final emigra-
tion of the lndians, On the Certificate of the Comm” General, or
other Officer placed over them, specifying that they have faithfully
performed all the duties required of them by law, they shall be enti-
tled to a grant in fee simple of One Quarter section of arable land
to include as near as possible the improvements made by the Colony,
the right of each individual to be decided by lot. A further encour-
agement to emigration and settlement, might be given by a prospec-
tive pre-emption law, conferring a right to purchase at the Government
price one Quarter section of the public land, in all able bodied white
males who would actually settle on or before a given day, and con-
tinue to inhabit and cultivate the said tract of land until the final
emigration of the Seminole Indians. Each settler under this law
should be exempt from any other than the ordinary law of the Coun-
try. But he should be required to produce the Certificate of the
Comm" Officer of the district to prove the commencement and
continuance of his settlement and improvement.

Under this encouragement to emigration, I feel the utmost con-
fidence, that in less than two Years, there would not be a resting place
for the Indians north of the everglades, and that when confined to that
unwholesome and comfortless region, if they are not exhausted, by
disease or famine, they will be contented to emigrate from a country,
which can afford them no enjoyment. I entertain no doubt but that
the adoption of this measure would be attended with entire success.
That it would save thousands of valuable lives, and millions of public
Treasure—While the Colonies are farming, and until they are enabled
to defend themselves, I would employ a sufficient Military force, to
escort the settlers in safety to their new homes, to guard the settle-
ments, and drive the enemy into the Everglades. And instead of
exhausting the Treasure of the Government, and destroying the Army
by fruitless and unavailing marches, in the vain effort to overtake and
destroy them, when pursuit is hopeless, I would endeavour to keep
them in that inhospitable region, as long as they might prefer it,
to the Country assigned them in the West. By occupying healthy
positions in the adjacent country, with Military Posts, and cutting off
all communications with travellers, who have, and may continue to
supply their wants, they would be compelled from necessity to emi-
grate.
From no data in my possession am I able to form a correct estimate
of the number of Indians yet remaining in the Country, But I have
believed their force as well as their character, has been and is still
calculated to low.
I have given you hastily my views of the best mode of expelling
them, but I shall be happy, to afford you every assistance in my power
to prosecute any plan which may be adopted to relieve the Country
from their presence.

SIR, As it is highly probable that the Service of Yourself and the
officers under Your command will be required in the course of the
fall and winter with the troops in the field, it is extremely desirable
that you should so arrange the duties of constructing the roads placed
under your Superintendance," that these may be left for a short
period without injury to their progress. The better way to effect
this object, is by placing them, or such part as can be soon ready
for such a course, under contract, to be paid for after the Same shall
have been inspected and received.
Should You consider it advisable to leave an agent to superintend
the operation of the contractors, during the temporary absence of
Yourself and officers, You will immediately apprize me of the Same,
his name & proper compensation."

Walkers Town for the purpose of meeting all his people, and taking a
correct census (from my own personal observation) of their number,
ages &c.;—of appraising & receiving such personal property as they
were prepared to turn over to me, and of ascertaining the quantity of
land cleared by them, the probable cost of clearing the same;—the
value of the improvements thereon &c. &c. Though they had a fort-
night's notice, and I reminded them the day previous, that the next
was the day appointed, they failed to assemble as they had promised.
I went over nearly all their land and did not see more than half a
dozen warriors, the rest were scattered about at the different drinking
establishments, in no state to attend to business.
I find here difficulties as great, if not greater than those which I
experienced in ascertaining the precise boundry of Econ-chatta-mico's
lands. There are two men who claim, by pre emption, half a section

of the same land claimed by the Indians These men have cleared a
part of the land and continue to cultivate the same.
The land sold by Yellowhare, consisting of one half of the lower
reserve, (Walker's,) has not yet been laid off. Under these circum-
stances I have concluded to employ a competent surveyor to run the
dividing line between the Indian reserves and the lands by which they
are bounded I will give the purchaser of Yellowhare's lands, notice,
and will require him to pay the expense of defining his own bounderies.
The 31" Ultimo was the day appointed to meet Econ-chatta-mico's
people. I accordingly attended, but here also I was disapointed.
But about the same number of warriors, made their appearence that
I meet at Walkers Town. The chiefs offered to assemble their people
in an hour, but I refused to wait, in as much as I had become well
convinced that it would be impolitic to pay their annuity when—they
at present. I therefore told them that they should receive their
annuity when they were ready to start for Arkansas. They are in no
want of money now having themselves disposed of nearly all their
stock at private sale, notwithstanding my exertions to get possession
of it.
The facility with which the Indians procure liquor, renders it very
difficult to do any thing with them. The laws are strict upon the
subject, but it is very difficult to find sufficient evidence to convict the
offenders. I have offered a reward of five dollars, to any one who will
prosicute to conviction, any person or persons who presists in selling
whiskey to Indians contrary to law. This I believe to be the only way
in which a stop can be put to it.
Things appear now more favorable than they ever have done, to the
emigration of the Apalachicolas. I have but little doubt of being
able to keep them together till the first of October. Arrangements
are now making to throw a sufficient military force into their neighbor-
hood by that time to prevent their escape, should it be attempted.

addressed to you relative to the illegal importation into the United
States of certain Negroes in the Schooner Emperor; * and I have the
honor to add copies of the Reports of the District Attorney to this
Office relative to an information instituted by him against the Vessel,
and another against the Negroes. It will be perceived that the for-

true, the negroes are in the custody of the Marshal of the District,
subject to the orders of the President of the U. States according to
the provisions of the act of 3" March 1819.
In the report from the District Attorney are embraced nine indict-
ments against Charles G. Cox, and one against Joseph Croskey for
the illegal importation and holding of these Negroes. As these cases
(being criminal proceedings) do not fall within the superintendance
of this Office, I have deemed it proper to inclose you a copy of the
report of the District Attorney in relation to them, that if any further
instructions are considered necessary they may be given.

SIR It is somewhat doubted, in the present unsettled condition of
Florida, if you will be able to give immediate attention to the road
between Tallahassee & S“Augustine, your first operations will there-
fore be upon the road from Tallahassee to Iola." This is represented
as an old road requiring repairs; you will inspect it thoroughly and
decide upon the best method of expending upon it the amount ap-
propriated. Lt" Blake" & Scammon,” ordered to report to you, will
leave this place in a day or two and will take with them a chain &
compass & also a box sextant.”

relative to the route of the Jacksonville road. On Oct. 1, 1838 (loc. cit.), he wrote
that he had put Lt. Scammon in charge of the Tallahassee-Iola road and the latter
informed Abert, Nov. 1, 1838 (loc. cit.), that he considered it impracticable to
begin operations on that road for some time. He requested employment else-

the case of Elizabeth Wiggins vs: The United States, on a claim for
300 acres of land, which was decided pro forma by agreement, against
the United States. The claimant in this case rests her claim entirely
upon a document purporting to be a certified copy, made by Tomas de
Aguilar Secretary of the Government of the Province of East Florida
while it was under the Spanish Government, of a concession of that
government for the land in question; it does not appear that this copy
was ever in the archives—which have been searched and no original
can be found there—nor has the claimant been able to adduce any
proof, that such an original ever existed. There is a large class of
these cases, embracing more than half a million of acres—and the
object in this arrangement, is, to get the opinion of the Supreme Court
upon the isolated question of the validity of these certificates.
I am preparing for you an abstract of the argument in this and the
other cases decided at our last July Term [which, by the by, is not yet

[NA:TD, ST, Lets. from GLO to ST:ALS]
GENERAL LAND OFFICE September 27* 1838.
SIR, By the 1st section of the act of Congress entitled “An Act
making further provision for the sale and disposition of the public
grounds in the cities of St Augustine and Pensacola and to reserve
certain lots and buildings for public purposes, and to provide for
their repair and preservation,” approved June 28*1832, (L.L. page
324 P* 2)" the President “is required to cause to be selected such
of the lots and buildings in the City of St. Augustine and of Pensa-
cola as may in his opinion be needed for public purposes, which when
so selected, shall be kept for the use of the United States; and when
the selection shall have been made of such lots or buildings, it shall
be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to cause to be surveyed
all the public and private lots and commons in and about the said
cities; one copy of which survey shall be lodged in the land offices
in which the respective places are situated, and the other copy deliv-
ered to the City Authorities to be there kept and preserved as other
records pertaining to the Corporations of said Cities” and in pursu-
ance of the Secretary's order of the 24" of November 1832,” instruc-
tions were issued from this office to the Survey General at Tallahassee
to cause all the public and private lots and commons in and about
the City of St Augustine to be surveyed,” and a draft of the same

with suitable designations showing those which have been granted
for corporate purposes by the laws of Spain or Congress, those which
are the property of the United States, and those which have been
confirmed to individuals; as further required by the Secretary's
order the plats and field notes of the survey of St Augustine returned
by the Surveyor General were submitted to him with the Commis-
sioner's letter of the 30" of May 1836.” and in his communication of
the 3rd of the succeeding month returning the plats to be filed in
this office,” it was directed in reference to the sale of the lots that
the office should abide the directions of the President since which
there does not appear to have been any further action, so far as
known to this office. Inasmuch as a considerable time has elapsed
since the passage of the law and great anxiety seems to prevail on
the part of the citizens of St. Augustine to have the vacant lots
brought into market, I would respectfully again invite the attention
of the Department to the Subject and take the liberty of recommend-
ing that the immediate action of the Secretaries of War * and of
the Navy may be procured, as to the lots or portions of lots which
they would recommend to be reserved under the act for Military
and Naval purposes, and immediately after the President shall have
sanctioned and approved such reservations, the balance of the lots
might be subdivided to suit purchasers, and be offerred for sale as
directed by the second section of the Act.
For this purpose I herewith enclose a tracing of the general map
of the City taken from that returned by the Surveyor General, upon
which as will be seen have been disignated in blue ink all the public
lots, as laid down on the separate maps of the blocks or squares on
an enlarged scale, returned at the same time by the Surveyor Gen-
eral, likewise extracts are given from the field notes of survey descrip-
tive of the manner in which the lots were occupied at the date of
the survey, all which together with such other information as may
be on file in the War and Navy Departments will it is hoped be
sufficient to enable the President to direct which of the public lots or
what portions of them shall be reserved under the Act.
As regards the City of Pensacola, no returns having yet been
received from the Surveyor General his attention was called to the

SIR, By to-day's mail I have caused to be forwarded to you a copy
of the last report made to Congress on the condition of the Banks. If
you have any statements in relation to the condition of the Banks of
Florida of a later date than those contained in this document, or if
you obtain any such between this time and the close of the approaching
session of Congress, I will be obliged to you if you will cause them to be
forwarded to me without delay. I regret that the currency of Florida
is, according to the latest quotations in the New-York and Phila-
delphia Price Currents, in a worse condition than that of any other
part of the Union. Considering the immense amount of money dis-
bursed in that quarter, I had expected that, by this time, the notes of
your Banks would have been on a level with those of Georgia. I
sincerely hope that due efforts will be made by your Banks to amend
an evil so injurious to the financial operations of this Department, as
well as to the best interests of the Territory.”

PUBLIC MEETING
A meeting of the citizens of Tallahassee is requested at 11 o'clock
this day at Brown's Hotel, to take into consideration the subject of
the proposed change in the Mail route between this city and Augusta,
Geo. The mail has formerly been carried in four horse coaches,
which in fact are oftentimes found insufficient for the accommoda-
tion of travellers going north and south. The advertisement of the
Post Master General proposes to change from four to two horse
coaches which at many seasons will almost prevent the possibility
of our citizens going north by this route. As it is likewise proposed
to consider bids for four horse coaches, it is believed that a public
expression of the wishes of our citizens would have considerable
weight in determining the choice of the Department.”

ST AUGUSTINE, November 30th 1838
JAMES WHITCOMB Esq Commissioner of Gen' Land Office.
SIR. The enclosed copy of a caveat against the Sale of a portion
of the lands embraced in the Proclamation of the 14" of July; * has
been lodged with us, by M. Benj” Putnam, Attorney for the Propri-
etors of the Arredondo Grant. As the Lands to which it refers, have
been much enquired after, & comprise some of the finest to be offered;
we have thought it right to forward this Notice to the Department,
and to await its instructions on the Subject, which we hope to receive
before the close of the Sale. There is no Spanish Survey of this
Grant, on file—and the lines were run by the United States Survey-
ors, in Strict accordance we believe, with the designation of the
Tract, as given in the Decree of the Supreme Court, by which the
Grant was confirmed.
The Term “Alleged”, applied in the Proclamation to the uncon-
firmed or outstanding claims, which may be filed with us by private
Individuals; being, not so precise or techinical, as to afford us a
perfectly clear indication of the course we are to pursue in the case
of unreasonable interuption of the sales, by the alledgement of false,
or unsupported claims; we have deemed it safest to refer to the Depart-
ment, where we feel any doubt, as to the propriety of Complying
with, or disregarding claims of this spurious or unfounded character.
We also avail ourselves of this opportunity to state, that we appre-
hend much further interuption of the sales; from the difficulties we
have encountered, in attempting to designate, or mark out, the Sec-
tions which may interfere with confirmed private claims; as many
of these (partly from the present disturbed State of the country)
are either unsurveyed, or unlocated; while not a few of those laid
down on the maps, will also form a source of confusion, from the
practice pursued by the United States Surveyors, of disregarding the
Spanish Line, in running out these claims, & merely Surveying to
the Proprietors, the amount of Land called for in their Grant,

I regret that such as been the pressure of business in this Office, that
your communications relative to the alleged errors in the surveys on
the S" John's river,” to which you again call my attention, have not,
for want of time, yet been taken up for examination. I hope it will
suffice for the present to inform you, that this office does not doubt
the correctness of your course, and it appears to me that you have
viewed the business from its commencement in a wrong light——The
persons with whom the Memorial orginated disclaim any intention of
implicating your official conduct, and there being no charge of that
nature contained in any of the papers, the object of the examination
when it shall be made, will be mainly as to the best mode of remedying
the evils occasioned by the omissions to survey the claims; on which
subject any suggestions which you may have to make will be gladly
considered—You have already been advised of the action of the Office
to prevent an extension of the conflictions by withdrawing from entry
the lands situated within and adjacent to the supposed claims, and the
Register and Receiver have reported a list of the sections thus situated,
according to the best information within their reach. The difficulties
to be encountered in rectifying this business are not novel, since
interferences from similar causes, exist in several of the Land Districts
in Missouri and indeed wherever private claims have been admitted

to you the perfect satisfaction which your official conduct has ever
given & to state that the withdrawal of your work is merely a step in
the System to be adopted by the Department as Soon as the number
of its officers will permit—namely to place as many as possible of the

The present one is situated 35 miles from the bar, up a difficult
river to navigate, and cannot be navigated without a pilot—When
we ship our produce here, we are obliged to send it first to Jackson-
ville to have it cleared. And when goods are brought to us, they
are also carried first to Jacksonville to be entered in the Custom
House And then transported back here, which necessarily causes
great inconvenience to a large portion of the Inhabitants of East
Florida. Wessels, also, which are only bound to the mouth of the
River, and have no business farther up are compelled to take a pilot
to go up to Jacksonville which is attended with a very great expense,
and frequently causes a great delay. Vessels also frequently com-
ing in here from Foreign ports, have an opportunity to dispose of
any part of their cargo they please, there being no Custom House
Officer here to prevent any thing of the kind. The Custom House
officers from Jacksonville never come down to the bar, on any busi-
ness that concerns the Custom House, And we are well aware that
there is no place in the United States where there is so great an
opportunity for smuggling as at this place, in consequence of the
Custom House being so far from the bar, And therefore we hope
that you will make a speedy change as there is a great necessity for
it—If you should do so we recommend to you Timothy Wightman

tions for establishing a Port of Entry at Indian Key on the coast of
Florida; transmitted for the consideration of the Hon. Committee on
Commerce of the House of Representatives by William A. White-
head.—
BALTIMORE Dec 23d 1838
MY DEAR SIR—On my arrival here from Washington I found your
letter dated Dec 17" relative to the circular from the friends of
Indian Key in which reference is made to me as substantiating the
truth of the following passage “The harbour of Indian Key is at least
equal to any other in Tropical Florida in the important points of
facility of ingress & egress, of depth of water, and of goodness and
security of anchorage as vessels of the largest class may be brought in
with perfect ease &c &c”—
I do not recollect to have ever given such description of the harbor
of Indian Key. I could not with truth have compared the harbor
with that of Key West or Tortugas in point of safety.—I believe I
recommended Indian Key at one time as a Port of Entry so that
vessels wrecked to the Northward of or near Indian Key might enter
there without being obliged to go to such a distance as Key West.—
I was told at Indian Key by D* Waterhouse & others that vessels that
had been got off by wreckers were totally lost in their voyage from
Indian Key to Key West, losing a great amount of property. For the
truth of this assertion I cannot of course vouch.
I do not remember the depth of water in the harbor of Indian Key.—
The Cutter Jackson lay about 2 miles from the Island in about 14 feet
Water.
I am Very Respectfully Your obed" Serv"

THE SURGEON GENERAL TO THOMAS H. BENTON
[NA:SF, 25 Cong., 3 sess.: LS*]
SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE December 30" 1838
SIR: Your communication of the 28* Inst” on the subject of an
armed occupation and Settlement of that part of Florida now overrun
by the Indians I have had the honor to receive.
In reply to your several interrogatories, “How far it is possible to
find land fit for cultivation for these Settlers, especially towards the
extremity of the Peninsula? whether healthy positions can be had for
stations? And what are the facilities of raising grain and vegetables
and of getting fish and game for the support of the settlers?” I beg
leave to present to you the following statement as the result of my
knowledge and experience in relation to the matters submitted to my
consideration.
There is an extensive range of Country and of very good land
betwen the cove of the Withlacoochee and Silver Spring Branch at the
head of Navigation on the Ochilawaha; and there are many good
tracts betwen those two Rivers, extending to the Indian Settlement
called Pilaklikaha, where there is another body of good land.
* Printed also in St. Augustine The News, Feb. 16, 1839, and in S. Doc. 42, 25
Cong., 3 sess.
* Not found.


## p. 555 (#569) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R IT OR Y 555
This section of Country is capapable of supporting several thousand
inhabitants; there is a plenty of game in it, and the Rivers and Lakes
in the Vicinity afford fish in abundance; and withall it has the ad-
vantage of Water communication by the Withlacoochee with the
Gulf of Mexico, and thro' the Ockliwaha and the S" Johns River with
the Atlantic. In addition to these considerations, there are several
healthy points in the Country, particularly in the vicinity of Fort
King; and here a large settlement should be made, as it will be the
Barrier betwen the Indians and the white settlements, and constitute
the base of operations.
There are some good lands on Talakchopto, both near the head of
the River where it is called Pease Creek, and on the lower banks near
the head of Charlottes Harbour.
There are three or four good tracts on or near the banks of the
Coloosa-Hatchee, particularly in the vicinity of Fort Thompson at the
great crossing of the River. Fish and game abounds I believe in this
Region. I am not so satisfied as to the healthfulness of this Section
of the Country; but it should be occupied at all riskes, as it is on the
line of the nearest practicable route betwen the Gulf and the Atlantic
side of the Peninsula.
A few good tracts can be gotten on the shores and on the Islands
within Marcus Sound near Cape Roman.
There is a beautiful tract of land of land on Pavilion River ten or
twelve leagues South East of Cape Roman; and some parcels of good
land may be found on the Banks of Shark River and on the shores of
Lake Manitee ten leagues still farther East.
At Cape Sable there is a beautiful spot for a Military Post and
Depot for a Colony, which should be established on a Prairie running
East and by North from that Cape along the coast towards Cape
Florida. This Prairie runs immediately on the Sea Shore for thirty
five miles, then turns a little North and to the interior of the Country,
extending perhaps twenty or thirty miles more in length. It appears
to be an inclined plain falling imperceptibly from the Sea Shore to the
Everglades, a distance of fifteen or twenty miles to the interior of the
Country, From what I saw of the products of the land on the Cape
and the Islands in the vicinity I am induced to believe that the soil
of this Prairie will produce in great perfection grain and vegetables of
every kind, with Sugar Cane Cotton &" &” Through the Prairie
there are numerous clumps and groves of trees which will afford both
fuel and building timber for the Settlers. The Keys and sand Bars
in front of the Cape make an excellent Harbour for Steam Boats and
Sail Vessels drawing from six to ten feet water. The waters along this
Coast are full of Turtle and fish of every kind, and the Prairie and
woods around abound in game.


## p. 556 (#570) ############################################

556 T E R R I TOR I. A. L. PA P E R S
The immediate site of Cape Sable is evidently healthy, as are almost
all situations directly on the Sea Board; and I have no doubt that
healthy positions can be gotten on the Prairie, as the climate is
delightful even in the Summer Season from the prevalence of the Sea
breeze, or trade winds.
There are also good tracts of land on new River, and a great body
of it on Indian River, both on the Atlantic side of the Peninsula; and
near this last River, on S" Lucies Sound, another settlement should
be made. This section of Country being within the influence of the
sea atmosphere should be healthy; fish abound in the Rivers and
Sounds about, and game perhaps is plenty in the Country.
The Settlement on the Gulf side at Cape Sable, and on the Atlantic
side near Indian River, with the present Military Post at Tampa Bay,
a small Post at Punta Rassa, a Block House at or near Cape Florida,
and another at Jupiter Inlet, with the occasional assistance of a
Revenue Cutter, will command the whole coast, and cut off the inter-
course between the Indians and the Spanish Fishermen, and Boatmen
from the British Isles; while tho two Settlements more in the interior
of the Country, with a Military establishment somewhere on the
middle ground between the Coloosa-Hatchee and Indian River
Settlements, will be in position to control the Indians.
I have like yourself arrived at the conclusion, that the War with
the Seminole Indians can be terminated in a shorter time, and at less
cost, by an Armed occupation of the Country, than by the continuance
of a regular mode of warfare. Our armies have been for years engaged
in hunting up, pursuing, and killing a few Indians in each Campaign;
and judging from the success we have already had, it will take five or
ten years longer to kill off those that still remain, and seem determined
to remain in the Country. The establishment of Military Colonies
on the other hand will change the System of Warfare. Instead of the
white men fighting the Indians in their Natural Fortresses, the
Indians will have to come out and attack the whites within their lines
of defence, and where the skill and intelligence of the Civilized man
can have its influence. We shall act on the defensive, and experience
teaches us that we are better at repelling an invasion, than in making a
Conquest. The Indians will certainly attack our Settlements; and
in each conflict, and in each succeeding Year, will lose more men than
have fallen before our heavy Colums marching thro the Country.
This is the way that the Western Country was won from the
Savages of that Region. The Pioneers to the West pitched their
camps and built their Block Houses thro the Country, and there
fought a little, and worked a little, until the Indians finding that they
could not dislodge the white men, pulled up stakes themselves and
retired beyon the Mississippi.


## p. 557 (#571) ############################################

F L OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 557
And so will the Seminole Indians act, for they cannot abide in the
same Country with the white man. As soon as they find that the
white men have set themselves down near their favorite haunts, and
are determined to hold on to the Country, thro Summer and thro
Winter and forever, they will, after repeated unsuccessful efforts to
destroy or drive off the Settlers, in submission to their destiny sur-
render to the white man, and ask to be removed to the West.
The proposed system of operations will have the advantage too of
settling the Country while the war progresses; and by the time that
the Indians have retired from the Country, it will be under culti-
vation an in a state to admit at once of a great influx of population;
whereas under the present order of things, the immediate Theatre of
action will be rendered still more desolate as the War continues; and
the adjacent districts being also drained of their resources, the Country
will not be in a condition to receive a Body of Emigrants for twelve
or eighteen months after the Indians have been cut off, or have been
removed to their new country beyond the Mississippi.”

We understand the contemplated arrangements of Messrs. Stockton
& Co., for the improvement of the Northern and Western Mail routs
have been nearly completed, and that the Stage line is now in full
operation from Mobile to Augusta, Georgia, via Florida. From
Mobile to Pensacola, the steamer Champion having undergone a
thorough repair, with new copper and copper boilers is now running.
There is also a tri-weekly stage running between Mobile and Pensacola,
carrying the mail. From Pensacola to Lagrange, a steamboat is in
fine order with handsome accommodations and first rate officers and
crew. From Lagrange to Macon, there is a line of four horse
coaches,—the horses are as fine as on any stage road—the coaches
for the most part new or nearly new, which we are however informed,

will be replaced early in the spring by others now building in Troy.
The rout from this city to Augusta, has been altered to go by Macon,
which is considered a great improvement, as the Florida line has the
advantage of the Georgia Rail Road, thus avoiding the ferriage of
two rivers, and the heavy sands near Augusta. The speed is much
increased. A passenger leaving Mobile arrives at Augusta twenty-four
hours in advance of the great mail. A passenger leaving Tallahassee
in the morning sleeps next night but one in Macon. Going westward
leaves Tallahassee in the morning and arrives at Pensacola the next
morning but one. The fare is likewise reduced. From Tallahassee
to Augusta, $33.50 instead of $38.50; and from Tallahassee to
Pensacola $28. instead of $34.
Hitherto a passenger leaving Tallahassee for the west at 2 o'clock,
A.M. was compelled to go around by Bainbridge, and thence to
Marianna being a distance of 95 miles—now the distance to Marianna
is only 70. The Steam Boat is in fine order—the crossing of the
Choctawhatchie will be made in a covered barge, protecting the
passengers from sun and rain; and all the ferries are made in the day
time. There are also four horse coaches on the road instead of two
horse hacks that caused so much discontent. Going North the fare
is reduced and the time quickened.
For the present a tri-weekly line will run from Tallahassee to
Quincy and will connect there with the mail line both west and
north—and soon as arrangements are complete, there will be a mail
five times a week from Quincy, to this place.
The main line going westward passes through Quincy, Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays about 12 o'clock M. Going north, Sundays,
Tuesdays and Fridays about ten A.M. At Macon the connection is
guarantied:—if the stages of the Florida line bring one more passenger
than can go on in the Mail and Telegraph line, an extra will carry him
through to the Rail Road. From Chattahoochee, through which
place the main line passes, the Apalachicola and St. Joseph mails are
taken by Steamboat to their destination."

Mar. 3, 1839 (5 STAT. 331), appropriated the sum of $7,500 for the construction of

GENERAL LAND OFFICE January 15" 1839–
REGISTER & RECEIVER S*Augustine Florida.
GENTLEMEN I have received your letter of the 30" November *
last accompanied by a Copy of the Protest of B. A. Putnam Ag" &
Attorney of one of the proprietors of the Arrendondo Grant—against
the Sale of Certain lands “claimed by the proprietor of said Grant as
a part thereof.”
You Observe in relation to this Grant that “the lines were run by
the United States Surveyors, in strict accordance” as you “believe
with the designation of the Tract, as given in the Decree of the
Supreme Court, by which the Grant was confirmed.”
If as would appear to be the Case, the lands described in the Protest
are without the limits of the Survey of the Arrendondo Grant, which
is referred to by you, the Protest in question cannot be recognized,
and Consequently should not Operate to prevent the sale of tracts
that you are satisfied are without the lines of the aforesaid Survey.
Under the terms of the Presidents Proclamation all private claims
that have been regularly filed for adjudication with any of the Boards
of Commissioners whether Confirmed or unconfirmed must be excepted
from sale.
It is your duty to Satisfy yourselves, as far as practicable of the
precise locations of such, and accordingly to exclude those lands
covered thereby from sale.
You are not authorized however to respect any Claim that has not
been duly filed for adjustment.
After the public Sales you are requested to furnish this Office with
a list of such tracts as may be excluded from sale designating the
particular Claims on account of which such tract or tracts may be
reserved from Sale.
Very Respectfully Your Obt Servant
JA* WHITCOMB Commissioner.

ment of Florida." If the plan which you propose can be carried
out, the Indians may be gradually destroyed or forced to submit;
and I know of no other measure likely to rid the country of them,
unless by following the example of the British Government in their
war with the Maroons in Jamaica, we employ the Blood Hound.
The only doubt I entertain as to the complete success of the plan
arises from the apprehension that the quantity of good land south
of the 28° of north latitude is not sufficient to induce settlers to
occupy it; north of that degree, the country is generally equal to the
Southern Counties of Georgia and Alabama; but south of it, the good
land is confined to a few detached spots along the coast on both sides
of the Peninsula; and fresh water can rarely be obtained on the Gulf
coast south of Charlotts Harbour even where the land is fit for cultiva-
tion. Between the mouth of the Wethlocco-chee and Tampa Bay
there is a considerable body of excellent land: there is also good land
near Tohop Koliga, and between the Ocklawaha and S" John rivers.
I have no doubt healthy situations for stations or resedences might
be found: and as to the Country North of the Wethlocco-chee it is
quite as healthy as the greater portion of the Western and South
western states; and the whole sea board is as healthy as any part of
Our Atlantic Sea board south of the Delaware I would advise that
the planters and farmers be urged to return to the plantations and
farms which they have abandoned and that the whole country north
of Tampa Bay be settled as soon as possible. The Coasts of Florida
afford as valuable fisheries in proportion to their extent as the Banks
of Newfoundland; and though the Country south of Tampa Bay
affords but little inducemnt to the Cultivator a population sufficient
to confine the Indians to the interior might find near the coast abun-
dant support by combining fishing with Cultivation, a supply of fresh
water could be obtained from the adjacent Islands.
The posts to be occupied by the troops must depend, necessarily
upon the number and position of the Settlements. There should
always be a sufficient force in the neighbourhood of each settlement to
serve as a rallying point to the settlers and to unite with them either
for purposes of protection or pursuit. There is a small body of good
land on New river, also on the Miami river near Cape Florida, which
was occupied previous to the war—two or three hundred inhabitants
might support themselves comfortably on that portion of the territory:
no part of the United States is more healthy: A Light House is neces-
sary in that neighbourhood; and so valuable is the commerce that
passes that part of the coast, and so numerous the wrecks in conse-
quence of the difficulty of the navigation, that, to protect the crews

and property cast on shore, the country should be settled and military
posts sheuld be established on New river, and near cape Florida.
There is a body of excellent land near Cape Sable the most southerly
point of the Peninsula, which would support several hundred inhabi-
tants—this it would be highly advantageous to occupy as soon as
possible. A military post should be established and maintained at
the Cape.
Posts will be necessary at Indian River Inlet, at the head of Indian
river, at New Smyrna, and at one or two other points between the
latter Post and S*Augustine. A Post should be established at Punta
Rosa South of Tampa, and at one or two points between Tampa and
the mouth of the Suwannee those points of course to be determined
by the settlements that may be made on or near the coast. The
Posts across the Country from the Gulf to the Atlantic should not be
considered permanent, but be changed as the Settlements in the
interior be advanced to the South. I have read the letter of Surgeon
General Lawson and agree with him generally in his views. As to
the war which we have carried on in Florida it differs not only from
any ever before waged by this Country, but from any other of which
we have an account in history, unless the Maroon war in Jamaica be
an exception. The object has been, and is now, not to beat and compel
the enemy to make peace, but to catch them. No force employed
against them, either in the former or present war Seminole war, no
matter by whom commanded, has ever been able to catch them; and
my decided opinion is if they ever be caught it must be with their
own consent: and that consent will hardly be given until they find
the white man in their way. Let them be crowded by settlers, and
that which has invariably occured throughout the whole history of
our settlements will occur again—they will not only consent to
remove, but will desire it as the greatest benefit the nation can con-
fer upon them.”

PETITION TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF WEST FLORIDA
[NA : HF, 25 Cong., 3 sess. :DS]
[Referred January 21, 1839]
To the Honorable Congress of the United States—
We whose names are undersigned, Citizens of the Western District
of Florida, would respectfully represent to your Honorable body that
* Cf. post, p. 568.

566 T E R R ITO RIA L PA PERS
whereas Government is instituted to promote the happiness of the
people, in the accomplishment of which object it is necessary that
wrongs should be redressed & rights enforced—and whereas it is the
bounden duty of all good Government to develope the resources of the
country under its controul, particularly where those resources may
be of general benefit to the people—We therefore, a portion of your
constituents, who have at all times & under all circumstances faith-
fully fullfilled all our duties which have devolved upon us as good &
faithfull Citizens, respectfully present to your Honorable body the
following statement of facts which we earnestly urge you to take
into serious consideration—Yellow River, a tributary stream of
Blackwater Bay, rises in the state of Alabama & pursuing a southerly
course through West Florida, discharges its waters into Blackwater
Bay, an arm of & conjoining the Bay of Escambia, about twenty
miles east of the City of Pensacola—About twenty miles of this
River in Walton County, Florida, is skirted on either side by a body
of rich & valuable land, which is now settled by about forty families
& is capable of supporting a much larger population—Many streams
valuable for affording mill-seats & the large quantities of excellent
timber of various kinds which skirt their borders, are tributary to this
River; but the navigation which is naturally good for plying steam-
boats & other craft of the same draft of water, is at this time so
obstructed for about fifty miles by huge piles of drift wood which
have become so matted together as to form rafts of considerable
extent in different parts of the River, that its navigation unless cleared
out is altogether impracticable—Were these rafts however, removed,
this River would be navigable for all boats necessary to be used here,
from the settlements on its borders to Pensacola—& the lands & fine
timber skirting its margins & its tributary streams would be greatly
enhanced in value—The people in this section of the country are now
compelled, in the absence of water communication, to transport
their produce over land for forty miles before they reach navigable
water which may float their produce to the nearest market and if they
continue on by land, the distance is lengthened to sixty miles & an
expense of crossing two ferries, one of which is four miles in extent,
is incurred—all these inconveniences & disadvantages may be
remedied by the removal of the rafts of wood in Yellow River, which
we are assured may be accomplished by the expenditure of about
six thousand Dollars—
The right of petitioning for a redress of grievances is guarantied to
us by the constitution under which we live, and the relative duty of
hearing & carefully considering our petitions must devolve upon your
Honorable body—And it is with confidence that we appeal to your
Honorable body to do what may be in your power to remove the

grievance under which we labour & remedy the evils of which we
complain—Whilst other portions of our Territory have been nurtured
& sustained by your fostering care & protection, we have been utterly
neglected & have silently borne the wrongs of which we now
complain; but we feel convinced that when they are made known to
in a respectfull manner, by a faithfull & unobtrusive people, they
will be immediately redressed—We therefore humbly pray that your
Honorable body will take this matter into serious consideration & that
you will make the necessary appropriation to remove all obstructions
to the navigation of Yellow River up to the Settlements on its borders
which is, by the river, about one hundred miles above its disembogue-
ment into Blackwater Bay & as in duty bound your petitioners will
ever pray

(copy) January 25" 1839.
SIR, I beg leave to call your attention to the subject of cleaning out
the Suwannie river in Florida, and to ask your aid and cooperation in
endeavouring to procure an appropriation for that purpose. I deem
it of vital importance in a military view. Its banks on both sides,
have been “debateable land”, the main scene of operations during the
present war, and provisions have been and continue to be landed on
Black Creek. and hawled one hundred & one hundred and fifty miles
to the banks, and neighborhood of the Suwannie—So important has
this river been deemed by the generals in the field, that recognoisances
have been frequently directed to be made, to see if it were possible to
use this Stream to introduce provisions, and on Several occasions,
steam boats have been forced up, at great hazard and some injury to
the boats. It is believed that the oyster banks at its mouth are the
only obstacles to its complete usefulness could be moved for $25000
and I have no doubt, if done before the commencement of the war, it
would have saved the United States four times the amount. Indeed,
as every failure to end the war, has arisen solely from the failure of
provisions it is more than probable, if the river in Florida, running into
the heart of the hostile country had been rendered available at an early
period, such as the Withlacoochie and the Suwannie, it is more than
probable this war would have long ago been ended.
It is proper to add, that if the Bill now proposed in the Senate by
Mr Benton should become a law,” the settlers on the Gulf side, could

not obtain the provisions necessary to support them, through any
other channel, without, great expense and hazard of life, and if left to
depend, for supplies, on what could be transported in wagons from
Black Creek, much danger would be incurred through the Summer,
of Starvation—or an army must be constantly employed, on the
march through the sickly season to escort and guard the baggage train.
For the considerations Sir, I have appealed to Congress for an
appropriation to clean out the river for a light house and a custom
house at its mouth—the light house will be necessary—the Custom
house useful and independant of the receipt of customs will form a
nucleus around which population will gather, and thus push the
Seminoles one step farther from the settled frontier.
I must respectfully request you sir to furnish me any information
your dept. may possess upon the Capabilities of the Suwannee river,
and if my views accord with yours that you would lend your excellent
aid to bring about the result above detailed, and so important, in
every point of view, civil and military *

To the Honorable, the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the
United States, in Congress assembled:
We, the undersigned, citizens of Florida, respectfully solicit of
your Honorable body, that you will graciously view the prayer of
Florida for a grant of a township of land, in aid of founding the
DADE INSTITUTE OF FLORIDA;
in which shall be honored the dead and educated the living.
Florida being a Territory, and therefore under the particular
care of Congress, the distressed and ravaged state of the country—
the many respected sons of the several States, lying unhonored in
her wilds—the many impoverished children, impoverished by the
Indian war, that must grow up in ignorance and vice, if a fostering
hand is not extended to them, emboldens us to urge this humane,
useful and charitable desire upon the sympathies of a feeling nation.

Bureau of Top Engin: WASHINGTON, Febry 4” 1839
THE HON: SECRETARY OF WAR
SIR. The letter from the Hon: M. Downing of Florida, of the 25th
ult° * states “A railroad is in contemplation from S*Augustine to
Picolata” It is the wish of this company to obtain the $17000 appro-
priated last year to repair the Millroad—and bridge between these
places, and the application is now pending before Congress. May
I beg that You will suspend all operations on that road, until the fate
of this application be known. As the terms offered by the Company
are highly favourable to the U.S. I have but little doubt of Success
before Congress.”
In reference to the same I am required to report the State of the
work and the effect of the Suspension asked for.
The work is under the direction of Lieutt R* M*Lane, who was
written to on the 4” of Jany * in the following words:
“A memorial has been presented to Congress for the transfer of the
appropriation to the Stock of a Railroad Company,” but as yet no
action has been had upon the same. You will please report upon the
advantages & disadvantages of such a plan, and whether the same
would be acceptable or not to the great body of the inhabitants of
that vicinity.
In the meantime such operations on the road you are making, as
would not suffer by the delay, or occasion damages to the contractors,
could be suspended.”
But before he could receive this letter, having duly advertised for
proposals, he had entered into contract, as will appear by an extract
81 NA(WD, CE, TB Reg. of Lets. Recd., No. 1).
* NA(WD, CE, TB Lets. Issued, Bk. 3). This letter also stated that the
appropriation was to be applied to the existing road between St. Augustine and
Picolata.

of a letter, dated 14* Jany 1830.* N° 1. and copies of the contracts
therein inclosed are herewith submitted, marked N* 2 & 3.
The letter from this Bureau, of the 4” of Jany, was not received by
Lt" M*Lane till some days after his Contracts were made. The
acknowledgement bears date the 23" of Jany,” a copy of which, N° 4,
is herewith inclosed; also copies of the memorials referred to, N° 5 & 6,
Lt"M"Lane's action in the matter appears in my judgment, to have
been correct, nor do I see how the work can now be suspended without
involving the U.S. in damages to the contractors.”

JOHN BRANCH 87 TO THE PRESIDENT
[LC:Van Buren Papers:ALS]
Private LIVE OAK Feby 5* 1839
MY DEAR SIR, As I neither desire or would accept of office, and
under the impression that my object will be better accomplished by
addressing you in-perseh directly, I have determined to do so in my
wonted frank manner. In truth the success of the principles you
have made the basis of your administration, mainly depend on a
united & vigourous action of all the friends of these principles. Dur-
ing my sojourn in Florida I have not been an indifferent spectator to
passing events, and while the inhabitants have had much cause to
deplore the ravages of the Indians, owing in part to collisions between
the Federal & Territorial powers, I have depricated still more the
insiduous encroachments of a Paper aristocracy. The Banks in this
Territory owing to injudicious legislation have the most alarming
powers conferr" on them. In addition to which, by the influence
they exert over the Territorial officers—more especially the Executive,
they overleap with impunity the few barriers erected by an inexpe-
rienced & incautious Legislature. The result of all this is that we are
mustering and arming a number of Corporation Principalities which
are already arrayed against your lending measures, and soon may
become irrisistible. This is not the most alarming view of this sub-
ject. The citisens who have no direct interest in the Banks may in

the end be burthen” with a debt of one or more hundred million of
dollars, to redeem the faith of the Territory & the indirectly plighted
faith of Congress. Much of the evil might be prevented provided
the Governor who has the appointment of a portion of the Directors
would place able & disinterested men in the directory. But he seems
to be content to retain, or put in such persons as are most acceptable
to the leading influences in Bank. As proof of this he has appointed
in the Union Bank, the brother of the President and also the brother
of the cashier

Bureau of Top Engineers WASHINGTON Febry 6" 1839.
THE HONBLE SECRETY OF WAR
SIR, The letter from the Hon. M. Downing of the 25" Jany,” upon
which I have been required to report, relates to the clearing out of the
Suwanee river in Florida, and asks the aid & cooperation of the
War Department in endeavours to procure an appropriation for that
purpose,
M" Downing States: “it is believed that the oysterbank at its
mouth, the only obstacle to its complete usefulness, could be removed
for $25,000.”
In the report of the Board of Engineers, of the 28 Febry 1829,”
upon the project of a canal to connect the Gulph of Mexico with the
atlantic Ocean, very favourable notice is taken of this river, & the
Board remarks “that the Suwanee having from the upper fork to the
Sea but one tributary, and its banks being thinly timbered, rather
low and not much liable to be undermined, is generally free from
driftwood, circumstances which, added to a good depth of water,
render the river well adapted to Steamboat navigation.”
The U. S. Survey of this river, extends to its junction with the
gulph. At this junction, says the Board, in the report before alluded
to, the river exhibits the appearance of a marshy delta, through which
numerous outlets run to the sea. The depth and course of the latter

experience frequent & sudden changes, by storms from the Sea &
floods from the Stream. The entrance of these outlets is moreover
obstructed by an extensive oysterbank projecting at least one mile
out from the Shore, furrowed by many narrow channels of various
depths. The main one runs near the western extremity of the oyster-
bank, and opposite the western and principal outlet of the river. It
affords at low tide about 4 feet of water; the tide rises from 18 to 30
inches and is chiefly governed by the winds. The least depth found,
after fairly entering the river as far up as near the mouth of the
S** Fe is about 12 feet.
From the map which accompanies this report it will be seen that
the oysterbank forms a crescent completely covering & protecting
the entire delta of the river, and that the present depth of water
through the western extremity of the bank is as great as the depth in
the channel across the bay between the bank & the mouth of the
river as Bradfords-island. To deepen the passage through the oyster-
bank would therefore be of no use, unless the deepening were con-
tinued through the channel to the mouth of the river.
The work is completely within the power of a dredging machine,
but the ultimate cost of the improvement it would be difficult to
state without further investigation of the locality, as, in addition to
the dredging of the bank and channel, it may become necessary to
obstruct all but the western outlet of the river.
Under these circumstances an estimate of the probable cost
cannot well be given. But for the dredging it may be stated that
a suitable boat delivered at the place, will probably cost not less
than . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $20,000.00

Expenses necessary to keep the same in activity for one
year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15,000.00
Total $38,200.00
The Survey which accompanies this report, not having been made
for such an object, is not sufficiently minute to justify an estimate of
the quantity of Material which will have to be removed from the
Oyster bank and the channel. The estimate is therefore for one
year. But as the dredging machine and the discharging scows will
last for many years with repairs, future expensies for this object will
be limited to the cost of repairs, and to those necessary to the active
use of the machine.
. But on examining the accompanying plan, it would appear that
not more than four feet water can be carried over the extensive shoal
outside of the oysterbank, should this be the case, the advantages of
deepening the pass through the bank & the channel would be very

limited. The shoal outside, however, was not much examined at the
time, and it is in reference to this that more minute Surveys are
requisite, before it can be decided whether the dredging proposed
would be a useful expenditure of money or not. Under these circum-
stances allow me to advise: that in the wording of the appropriation,
it should state to be “expended upon such a plan as the War Depart-
ment shall approve.”
With such a restriction upon the appropriation, as a preliminary
step a careful survey would first be made, and no other expenditure
unless a plan promising of success could be based upon the data
obtained by the Survey."

PETITION TO THE SENATE BY INHABITANTS OF
APALACHICOLA
[NA:HF, 25 Cong., 3 sess.:DS]
[Referred February 18, 1839]
To the Honorable the Senate of the United States
The Petition of the undersigned inhabitants of the Territory of
Florida residing in Apalachicola respectfully sheweth:
That your Petitioners have reason to believe, that an application
has been, or is about to be made to your Honorable body to sanction
a charter, granted by the Legislative Council of this Territory in its
session of 1836 to Messrs Hiram Nourse Hiram W. Brooks. J. D.
Howell G. L. Middlebrook Austen Williams John Gorrie, H. R.
Taylor. T. L. Mitchell E. Wood and O. C. Raymond, and entitled
the Insurance Bank of Apalachicola."
Your memorialists respectfully represent that they do not pretend
to be precisely informed of all the particular objects of the applicants
for said charter, but judging from the tenor of the instrument, and
common report, they believe that it is the general design of the above
named individuals, in the event of the act of the Legislative Council
conferring the charter, being confirmed by your Honorable body to
avail themselves of its privileges, and to speculate on its advantages
* See post, p. 605.
* An undated letter from George S. Hawkins and William P. DuVal to the
Senate Committee on Finance sets forth arguments for the approval of the charter
and transmits a letter from Hiram Nourse and Hiram W. Brooks to Hawkins,
Jan 31, 1837, concerning the commerce and the banking business of Apalachicola,
and a copy of the territorial law, Feb. 10, 1837, incorporating The Marine Insur-
ance Bank of Apalachicola. The law is printed in Fla., (Terr.), Acts, 1837, pp.
31–36.

to the entire exclusion of the rest of the community Your memorial-
ists represent that the above charter being in the language of legis-
lation “a close charter” they cannot admit the propriety of conferring
the exclusive previleges of monopolizing its Capital with all the other
advantages of a public institution like a bank, which, from its direct
influence on the currency every body is more or less concerned with,
upon a few persons who, bear a small proportion both in wealth, and
numbers to the whole community Your memorialists, further,
respectfully represent that they are anxious to be understood as not
desiring to see annulled or opposed in your Honorable body the
passage of a charter for a bank to be established in Apalachicola upon
principles advantageous to the whole public. On the contrary being
fully impressed with the belief that the banking facilities at present
afforded to the community are insufficient for the exigencies of its
trade, and that in consequence much of its banking business is effected
through institutions of other cities having no direct sympathies or
interests in its prosperity, they are extremely desirous to have a
bank located among them. But during the brief existence of Apala-
chicola as a city they have experienced in the failure of the only banks
established in it the painful evils of a “close charter”, and they have
much reason to believe that neither the welfare of a future bank,
nor the interests of its inhabitants would be consulted by granting
a similar charter as a monopoly to a few individuals while they be-
lieve that the benefit of both would be greatly promoted by one, the
stock of which should be open to the subscription of all persons alike
Your memorialists, therefore, respectfully pray that no such ex-
clusive privilege as the charter for a bank conferred by the Legis-
lative Council of this Territory upon the before named individuals,
may be granted, but that said charter may be so modified as that the
right to the charter, and the subscription for its stock shall be open,
under such regulations as may secure a fair distribution to all the
inhabitants of Apalachicola

MEMORIAL TO THE PRESIDENT BY THE LEGISLATIVE
COUNCIL
[NA:WD, AGO Lets. Recd., D50:DS*]
[No date, 1839]
To the President of the United States of America
The Memorial of the Senate and House of Representatives of the
Legislative Council of Florida respectfully represents, That your
memorialists view with deep interest and concern the present con-
dition of the frontier of this Territory, That although the United
States have a numerous regular force employed in its defence and in
prosecuting the war against the Seminole Indians, such as might
seem to justify the presumption of security to the people, there is
not a family in the border settlements for the distance of more than
three hundred miles, which is not exposed to the utmost peril.
Your memorialists have no disposition to complain of the neglect
of the General Government, which has on all occasions shewn a just
sympathy for our sufferings and afforded such defence, as might rea-

sonably have been esteemed sufficient to ensure our safety, but we
are constrained to say that the force employed for the past year,
has entirely failed to give the protection required, and that we are
yet exposted to the inroads of a subtle and ferocious enemy, and are
visited with all the calamities, and experience all the horrors inci-
dent to a state of War; with ruthless savages; After the discharge of
the Florida troops from services in January 1838, the inhabitants
were generally requested by the Government officers to reoccupy their
long abandoned homes and to proceed in cultivating their plantations;
deeming the force in the Country sufficient to afford full protection;
it was, however, too soon painfully illustrated that the inhabitants had
been lulled into a too fatal security: early in March of last year, the
numerous murders in Columbia, Alachua, Madison and Jefferson
Counties scenes which continued during the whole summer amount-
ing in several cases to the indiscriminate butchery of the whole fam-
ilies, without a survivor to give the horrid narrative of their untimely
fate, scenes which have continued and are now almost daily taking
place within a few miles of our Capitol and along the whole line of
frontier from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Coast: and the man-
gled bodies of Fathers, Mothers and helpless infants have presented
one general scene of carnage:
Your memorialists will not indulge the feelings or employ the im-
pressions which these barbarities are calculated to awake: But for a
more detailed account of these disasters they beg leave most respect-
fully to refer you to the special message of the Governor of this
Territory, and the official correspondence with which it is accom-
panied: those documents not only present in forcible terms the present
and past sufferings and distress of the frontier inhabitants, but they
illustrate with perspicuity the objections to the present system of
defence, and recommend one which if adopted, would in the opinion
of your memorialist, be productive of the most beneficial results:
without a change of the policy now pursued, without the sanction of
the General Government to the measures of the Governor of the
Territory in calling out the local force in cases of emergency, your
memorialists anticipate a continuance of the present disasters of the
frontier, so long as a single inhabitant shall endeavour to hold his
position against the enemy: Your memorialists can therefore no
longer turn a deaf ear to the sufferings of their fellow citizens, nor
can they longer remain silent spectators of the scenes of bloodshed
which are continually exhibited on our borders. We appeal to you
in behalf of the people of this Territory, they invoke your authority
as commander in chief of the Army of the United States, and they
respectfully ask that such a system of defence may be organized as
will give security to those who are now exposed to danger: Your

memorialists believe that the plan proposed by the Governor of the
Territory in his letter of the 4” of October 1838, to the Secretary of
War,” a copy of which accompanies his special message herewith
enclosed," and to which they beg leave to invite your special atten-
tion, is best calculated to answer the end designed. A plan similar
in some respects seems to have been contemplated by the Secretary
of War, and from the manner in which it was introduced in his last
annual report to Congress," your memorialists, and the people of this
Territory had flattered themselves that it would have been promptly
carried into execution. But from the answer of the commanding
General to the letter of the Governor of this Territory urging the
immediate adoption of this measure as the best means of defence, he
appears to regard the order of the War department for that purpose
as discretionary: and no preparations seems yet to have been made for
carrying it into effect.
If the frontier were divided into Districts, and the inhabitants
capable of bearing arms, were organized into companies and regiments
and mustered into service of the United States, they would in the
opinion of your memorialists, constitute the best and most efficient
defence of the frontier: their skill in the use of fire arms, their knowl-
edge of the Country and of the enemy, the interest they naturally feel
for the safety of their families, and their being accustomed to the
climate, render them peculiary fitted to that serivce: Under proper
rules of discipline and subordination, they would be efficient in the
field, and would be the best guardians of their own homes.—
The adoption of this mode of defence would give confidence and
security and would bring hundreds of emigrants to the frontier:
Without this or some other equally efficient plan, the patriotic inhabi-
tants, who have for more than three years past maintained their
ground: in spite of all the disasters and misfortunes to which they
have been exposed, and seeing no hope of relief, must retire, exhausted
by the ravages ef the of the enemy to some place of security, and
leave the savage foe in undisturbed possession of the Country.
Your memorialists beg leave also to state that on the refusal of the
Comds General to receive the local force into service, applications
were immediately made to the war Department by the officers of
Florida, through the Delegate in Congress and in several cases by
personal solicitation at the Department at Washington those appli-
cations have always been referred to the officer Comd" in Florida,
whose reply has invariably been that he had a sufficient number of

troops to defend the frontier and protect the inhabitants from further
scenes of bloodshed and murder—how far this has been proved will
be seen when your memorialists assert and declare that more persons
have been murdered by the Savage enemy during the past year than
had been during the whole of the preceding two years and a half!
In many of the Eastern Counties after the work of death had
progressed to some extent and the Comd" Gen' had been tendered
the services of the local force by their officers, and refused, the officers
commanding the militia in Columbia, Alachua & Duval Counties
were compelled (to prevent the entire abandement of the Country)
to employ their commands in scouting the Country, for the purpose
of giving protection to the settlers and of pursuing the scattered
parties of the enemy, by which means confidence was restored and
large Crops of Corn and other provisions made, which without the
employment of this force would have been entirely lost to the Country
as well as its entire population: the forces thus raised and employed
were unable to perform more service than a defensive one from the
want of proper supplies, the crop of the year 1837, had been consumed
by the army and very little forage, except what was transported from
a great distance, & at great expense could be furnished them, add to
which the United States stores, both Quarter Master and Commis-
saries were entirely closed against any application or requisitions of
the Geverher a Territorial Officer, even therequisitions of the Governor
had been entirely disregarded, whereby the Governor has had in some
cases to disband Troops called out in times of great danger, and when
their services were important: Had there been a scarcity of supply
in the Government Stores, the case would have been materially dif-
ferent: but at the same time that refusals to grant small supplies,
were made by the officers in charge of depots, they were filled to
everflowing with provisions: large quantities of which has since been
sold, at a great loss to the Government—
Your memorialists further represent that the troops who were in
service under the order of the Governor and other officers of the
Territory during the past year, and whose services were important
in preventing further scenes, of massacre on the frontier, up to this
time remain unpaid, although the payment has been repeatedly
urged on the Department—We trust that this will be no longer
delayed, and that the payment will be promptly made, to a gallant
and suffering people who have been ever ready to respond to their
Country's call—
Your memorialists having in this memorial taken a view of the
condition of the Territory, do most earnestly appeal for redress to the
President: let not this be considered as an idle complaint, formed
on light and or trifling grounds—

We respectfully, altho' earnestly ask that the Executive officer of
this Territory, may have power to obtain from the Government Stores,
such supplies as are necessary for the local force, whose services
are so frequently necessary on the frontier, and that the troops so
called out be mustered into service, and continued under the orders
of the Executive or of such officers as he may appoint to command
them: this arrangement being actually necessary, as the General
commanding is frequently two hundred miles from the settlements,
where those frequent outrages are committed by the enemy on the
persons and property of our Citizens, and to deprive us of the supplies
necessary to pursue the marauding parties of the enemy (until the
Commanding General can be consulted, amounts to a total and en-
tire denial of that protection that we have a right to expect"—

SIR; You will proceed with as little delay as practicable to Florida,
and after a full examination of the State of that territory and of the
War carrying on there, you will adopt such measures as may seem to
you most expedient to secure the protection of the settlers in Middle
and East Florida, to prosecute the War with vigour, and to bring it
to a speedy and successful termination. It is advisable that you

sentence letter written from Houston, Tex., advising that he had decided to
become a citizen of that republic (NA,SD, Resignations; Webb to Del. Downing,
Jan. 29, 1839, NA, SD, Applications). In the letter to Downing and in one of
Jan. 1, 1839, to the Secretary of State enclosing his resignation, he had recom-
mended as his successor Charles Walker, a resident of Key West for 16 months,
who had formerly been a lawyer in New York City (NA,SD, Applications).
Webb became a prominent citizen of Texas, serving as a Cabinet officer, Con-
gressman, member of the Constitutional Convention, reporter for the Supreme
Court, and a Judge (Walter P. Webb, ed., Handbook of Texas, II, 873-874).
* The commission was transmitted to Marvin on Mar. 11, 1839 (NA, SD, Dom.

should visit that part of the country which has so lately been the
theatre of Indian depredations and murders, ascertain if possible what
hostile bands were concerned in them, and take measures to prevent
the recurrence of similar outrages in future. If, as it is probable, it
should appear that the fugitive Creeks have committed these acts,
you will take the proper steps to drive them from their fastnesses, and
if practicable to induce them to come in and surrender. Whatever
measures of rigour it may be necessary to adopt in order to repress
the incursions of the Indians, no threats ought to be held out against
them; but on the contrary, the language of all communications with
them should be mild and conciliatory; the object of the government
being not to punish their barbarities however enormous they may
have been, but to prevent their repetition. Congress having by
making an appropriation for that purpose, signified a desire that
another effort should be made to treat with the Seminoles, you will
use your best endeavors to open a communication with their Chiefs,
and if they show any willingness to enter into a negotiation with you
for their peaceful removal, you are at liberty to make a truce with
them until the terms can be finally arranged, confirming them to that
portion of the Peninsula south of 27° 30" latitude, until they can be
finally removed according to the terms of the treaty of Payne's landing.
It appears to the Department equally important to the entire
pacification of the territory, to its effectual protection and early
settlement, as well as to the prompt defence of the fortresses on the
Gulf of Mexico, that a chain of posts to be connected by a good road
should be established across the peninsula from the river St. John's, to
Tampa Bay, and you are directed to cause an examination to be made
of the country between those waters, in order to determine the most
suitable points of departure and the best line for the formation of such
a communication between the Atlantic and the Gulph; and if you find
it practicable to establish it, you will proceed to do so. The location
and construction of the road, the number and proximity of the posts,
and all other details both for the protection of the route, the supply
of the posts with men, horses and provisions are to be confided
altogether to your discretion. Your attention however is called to the
necessity of placing a sufficient force at each of these posts, to be
composed of Infantry as well as Calvary, and of encouraging the
inhabitants of Florida, who are now fed by the bounty of the govern-
ment to settle near them and under their protection to cultivate the
country in their immediate vicinity.—
You will direct your attention to the withdrawal of such portions
of the regular forces as can be spared from Florida, and supply their
places by drafts from the militia of the territory not to exceed 1000

mounted men, or what would be preferable, 1500, in the proportion
of 500 mounted and 1000 Infantry—With a view to the protection of
the commerce of the gulph of Florida, you will establish such posts
along the coast as you may judge necessary, but especially at Key
Biscayne, New river Inlet and Indian river Inlet. Two vessels are
now preparing to cruise steadily along that coast, and will co-operate
with the forces at the posts you may establish to protect vessels
navigating that sea and to prevent all communication between the
Indians and the Cuba fisherman who are supposed to furnish them
with supplies. In the execution of General Taylor's plan to divide a
certain portion of the country into districts of 20 miles square, it will
be necessary to avoid withdrawing the posts in front of the frontier
plantations which are still occupied by the settlers. Every thing
should be done to render those settlements perfectly secure and in
whatever plan of defence you may think proper to adopt, that of these
exterior plantations should be an object of primary consideration.”
I have the honor to be, &c.

objects contemplated by this measure, are to cooperate with the land
forces by transporting Such troops as it may be desirable to Send
from one Station to another along the coast—to cut off all communi-

and Cuba, and to prevent a repetition of the outrages perpetrated by
the Savages, during the last summer, upon the property and persons
of those who were shipwrecked and cast upon that shore. Orders
will be given to the Quarter Master at Baltimore, where the Steamer
now is, to deliver that Wessel to any Officer you may think proper to
designate for that command, after causing such repairs and altera-

of the advantages of the arrangement you propose for paying the
Legislative and other Territorial expences of Florida. I take it for
granted however as the duties of my office are prescribed by law and
my compensation is so very inadequate, that it is not the intention
of the Department to impose additional duties and responsibilities
which do not appertain to my Office, without a fair remuneration by a
percentage on the amount audited and disbursed. I am satisfied
that I could save to the Government more than 5 p" cent on the whole
amount appropriated for the pay and expences of the Legislative
Council, by purchasing stationary &c in New York and making my
contracts here for printing & other contingencies for the Council,

CAPT CPBLL GRAHAM U. S. C. T. E. Mobile Al"
SIR, During the last Session of Congress there were two appropria-
tions for river Surveys in Florida, viz:
1 “for the removal of obstructions at the mouth of the Suwanee river,
and for the Survey of Said river with a view to its improvement:
$15000.”
2 “For the Survey of Yellowriver, Fla, to ascertain the practicability
of removing the raft which obstructs its navigability . . . . .
$500.00” "
The Superintendence of these Surveys is assigned to you in addi-
tion to your other duties.
The Suwanee has been already surveyed to its mouth, which will
limit Your attention to the obstructions there, and the inclosed copy
of that Survey will present to your immediate notice the character
of those obstructions.
On examining this Sketch, it appears that the deepest water from
the gulph approaches nearest to the most eastern pass (N° 1) across
the oyster bank, but the pass is both, shallow & narrow, and the
extent of shoal water in the bay of considerable length, from the pass
to the river.
The Second pass (N° 2) through this bank, proceeding—westwardly,
is liable to the same objections. The third also, (N° 3) but in this
the six foot depth, outside & inside the bank approaches the nearest.
The fourth (N° 4) is the best passage through the bank, and is the
one now used in all commercial intercourse with the mouth of the
18 See post, p. 608.
* Act approved Mar. 3, 1839, 5 STAT. 331.

river, but altho’ the best it is also difficult from the extent of shoal
water of a less depth than six feet. Also, if the survey be correct,
the best approach from the gulph is adjacent to the most eastern
pass, and any vessel must be exposed to a long and critical detour befor
it can gain the most western.
From these facts it will be perceived that whichever pass should
be adopted as the subject of any system of improvement, it will have
to be deepened, and the more westwardly the position of this pass,
the greater its distance from the best access to the open gulph.
It is also apparent from the map, that if a nine foot depth should
be attempted, the shortest line of operations would be at the second
pass westwardly (N° 2), but for a six foot depth the shortest line
would be at the third pass westwardly (N° 3). Our efforts cannot be
directed to effecting a depth of entrance of less than six feet, and if
one of nine could probably be made at no more than a fair proportional
increase of cost so much the better.
Protected as this bay is, by the oysterbank, a dredgeboat could
operate most effectively within the bay and during a great time out-
side. But if a sufficiently wide passage were made through the bank
at, either, the second or third pass, and then a proper depth dredged
to the river, and the other passes through the bank filled up, by throw-
ing the excavated material in them, the waters of the river & bay
would have no other outlet than through the newly excavated pass,
and I should not be surprised if under such circumstances, they would
of themselves be sufficient to open the channel from the bank outside
to the one which now exist there. If care were taken to throw the
excavated oysters in the passes filled up, they would soon grow,
adhere to each other and form a permanent work.
These general reflections are hazarded upon an inspection of the
map now sent to you. Your first case will be to determine the ac-
curacy of this map and to add to it those details of soundings of which
it is now deficient, and without which one cannot determine upon
any plan of improvement. In the execution of this Survey your
attention will be directed to its object; and with the results obtained
you will furnish your views, of the plan which should be pursued and
of its probable cost.”
The “Yellow River” is a name that you will probably not find on
the map of Florida. It is understood to be the “Yellow water”, a
river which empties itself into the northeastern part of Pensacola bay.
Lieut Palmer will be directed to report to you.”

posed to be coming from the north have been making their way
south, passing through the swamps and dense hammocks on the route
and killing such persons as they could meet. In the Alachua prairie,
they killed within a week three citizens, who were out in search of
cattle and within 9 miles of Micanopy on the road leading to this
post, a party of five attacked an equal party of mounted volunteers
put them to flight and killed one man and one horse, a party of regular
officers with a small escort had just passed over the road, where the
volunteers were attacked, without molestation. This party was over-
taken by the flying volunteers and returned with some of the men
of Capt. Tyner's detachment of volunteers stationed at Fort Wheelock
within a mile and a quarter of the place of attack, and recovered the
body of the dead volunteer & the guns and saddles of the defeated
party. It is a remarkable fact that the Indians do not attack the
parties of regular Troops, which are constantly traveling the country;
nor do they attack, or molest the trains of wagons, which are con-
stantly passing from Post to Post with no other guard than the
drivers; and officers, in parties of two or three, are allowed to pass
without notice. The opinion prevails that the war, which is now
carried on, is between the people of the country and the Indians,
the latter bearing great hatred to the former and attributing to them
the cause of the war and the desire to expell their race. It is certain,
that the Indians avoid meeting the regulars, as they have daily oppor-
tunities of attacking them on fair terms, and often when their num-
bers are superior to our parties. General Taylor left me this morning
for Tampa. He has been very actively employed in arranging his
squares and posting the Troops so as to afford a more sure protection
to the settlements West of the Suwanee. He met Gov. Call and
made arrangements with him for calling out the Militia to protect
the country West of the Suwannee, while I have made similar arrange-
ments with Col. Warren of the Florida Militia, for the protection of
the settlements East of the Suwanee; it is between the road leading
from Fort Heileman to Tallahassee and this Post, that the Indians
are now operating in small parties probably because they find it
dangerous longer to continue among the settlements and are making
their way southwardly to avoid the troops posted in the squares,
availing themselves on their way of every opportunity to do all the
mischief in their power by attacking defenceless and isolated indi-
viduals. If that be the fact, we are in hopes of driving them below
the 28" degree of North Latitude and if they can be kept there, they
can hereafter do little or no injury, as the coast is now covered from
St. Augustine to Key Biscayene by forts and cruisers. It is possible,
that those going South, may be on their way to meet their brethren
in that quarter, to consider the propriety of attending to the invitation

to meet me at this post. The indians of late have been very shy of
meeting us, as they are apprehensive that we are always laying plans
for entrapping them and it is difficult to make them beleive that we
have any other view than that of seizing them and forcing them on
board of vessels for their transportation to the West. If they go
South and are permitted to remain quiet for some time and they
cease their hostile operations, in the course of time we may induce
them to emigrate; but it is utterly impossible, unless we have an
immense force, one large enough to cover the whole country with
posts, to subdue them. They will not fight unless forced to it, and
as the country is so vast and so full of dense swamps and hammocks
it is not difficult for them to evade our pursuit. If I shall not be able
to induce them to meet me as invited, it appears to me the best plan
to pursue, will be to Settle the country by allowing every able bodied
man, who will come into the country and settle on the public domain
three years, 320 acres of land, bring with them their arms. They
can settle in the vicinity of the military posts from which they would
receive protection and in a little while they would be stronger than
the Indians and thus force them out of the country; or if permitted
to remain, the Indians would become perfectly harmless and even
serviceable to the inhabitants in many ways, as they are not always
unwilling to work for wages or compensation in goods or money.
I transmit herewith a copy of a letter from Brig. Genl. Taylor asking
to be relieved from the command of the troops in this territory dated

[May, 1839]
THE MAILS.—Since our notice of the irregularity in the mails, we
have received several communications from Post Masters on the routes
from Tallahassee east and west. The P. M. at Miccasukie states that
there is no mail to that place and the packages for that office are de-
tained at Bailey's Mills, and carried over to Miccasukie by private
conveyance. We are likewise informed that the mail for Monticello is
sometimes too small to contain all the packages, which lay over in
such care at the Tallahassee P. O. This will account for the occasional
failure at the Miccasukie office.—We hope this will be corrected in
future.
Mr. Kenan, P. M. at Quincy, writes us that the packages for that
place are sometimes forwarded in the Northern mail, which comes
under the brass lock, and can only be opened at a distributing office.
He says, “on the 4th inst there was but one package received here by
the way mail from Tallahassee, and that was from Salubrity. I sent
the mail under the brass lock northward, as I should have done. On
the 12th one bundle of the Star, of the 3d, for this place was received
by the Northern Mail. The other bundle of the Star of that date was
received by the Tallahassee mail on the 14th. On the 12th, the letters
for this office, mailed in Tallahassee on the 3d, were received by the
Northern Mail. The fault most assuredly originated at the P. O. in
Tallahassee.”
If Mr. Kenan is correct, the way packages and those for the west
have been put in the wrong mail bag at the Tallahassee P. O. But we
are informed by the P. M. at Chattahoochee, that he finds no difficulty

in opening the “Brass Lock,” (which occasionally comes to that office,)
with the common key, simply by a light tap of a hammer upon the key.
We would suggest the same process to the Quincy P. M. should a
failure again occur in the receipt of packages due that office.
Again on the 1st May, Mr. Keenan writes “That you may see with
your own eyes that errors occur at Tallahassee, I have put under an
envelope to your address a bundle of the Floridian, of Nov. 17, 1838,
directed to “St. Pedro, Fla., which was received here on Sunday last,
by the western mail; on Monday I put it in the Tallahassee mail, and
on Tuesday it came back here in the Tallahassee mail.”
We publish the above extracts in justice to the P. M. at Quincy,
as we have no disposition unnecessarily to censure any one. A little
more care and attention at the post offices would save a deal of trouble
and perplexity to all parties.

chiefs, and return to Washington until that period.”
Whatever line is definitively decided upon, should be so defined
as to enable the department, accurately, to describe it, and to declare
the Territory South of it, Indian Territory, in order to the strict
execution of the non Intercourse Act within its limits *—

BRIG GENERAL Z. TAYLOR. Commanding &c. &c. &c. Florida.
SIR, Rumours have reached the department that many persons in
Florida who are able to provide for themselves, and consequently do
not come under the purview of the Resolution of the 1* February
1836,” authorizing the distribution of provisions to the suffering
inhabitants of that Territory, are now drawing rations for themselves,
families and negroes. ,
I have to request that you will select an officer in whose judgment
confidence can be placed, to examine the lists of individuals drawing
supplies under the Resolution, and strike from them all persons who
are not, in his opinion, entitled to the benefits of that Act. And that
you will enjoin upon the Agents entrusted with the distribution of
their supplies, the necessity of constant vigilance to prevent a recur-
rence of similar frauds, and to ensure the fulfilment of the object of
the Resolution, a copy of which, together with a Copy of the Regula-
tion of this department on the subject, dated the 13" September
1837,” are herewith transmitted for your government.

SIR. It is desirable that the commander of the Steamer Poinsett
should proceed, as early as practicable, with that vessel to the coast
of Florida, and cruise along the Atlantic shore with it, and other
vessels belonging to the War Department which will be placed under
his command, and among the Keys off the Southern point of that
coast, for the purpose of intercepting all communication between the
Indians and the fishing or other boats, from the island of the Bahamas
or Cuba; of protecting all vessels that may be cast on shore, or other-
wise in distress on that coast, and of co-operating with the land forces
under General Taylor in preventing all communication between the
whites and Indians, and in the prosecution of the war against the
Seminoles, if it should unfortunately be renewed.
The commander of the Squadron will place himself in communica-
tion with the officer commanding the land forces, in order to learn
what points of the coast are considered by him most exposed, and
where the presence of the vessels under his command may be most
useful, as well as to co-operate in any military operations, if they
should again become necessary to Suppress Indian hostilities in the
Territory of Florida.”

the district of country thus set apart for their temporary residence.”
The district designated by the General is comprised within the fol-
lowing boundaries viz—Beginning at the most Southern point of land
between Charlotte Harbor and the Coloosahatchee or Sanybel river,
opposite to Sanybel Island: thence into Charlotte Harbor, by the
Southern pass between Pine Island and said Point along the eastern
shore of said harbor to Talak Chopko or Pease Creek: thence up that
river to Hatchee-Thloko or Big Creek: thence up said Creek to its
source: thence Eastwardly to the Northern point of Lake Istopoga:
thence along the Eastern outlet of said Lake, called Istopoga Creek, to
the Kissimmie river: thence southwardly down the Kissimmie to
Lake Oke-chobee: thence south through said Lake to Echalahatchee
or Shark river: thence down said river Westwardly to its mouth:
thence along the sea shore Northwardly to the place of beginning.
In order to render effective this agreement entered into between the
General and the Seminoles, the most vigorous measures must be
adopted, and the utmost vigilance exercised to prevent the Whites
from intruding on the territory thus set apart. The territory is
accordingly, by order of the President of the United States, declared to
be Indian territory, to which are applicable all the provisions of the
Act of the 30" of June 1834, entitled, “An Act to regulate trade and
intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve peace on the fron-
tiers.” 86
You are therefore instructed to extend to the Indians in Florida
every aid in your power in removing as soon as possible within the
limits of the district thus assigned to them: and to use your best
endeavours to prevent any white person from passing into said Indian
territory, without written authority or license to do so. You will
allow no one to trade with the Indians without a license, and then only
under the strict supervision of an Officer of the regular Army: and if
any person in violation of your orders attempts to do so, you will
remove him forthwith and seize whatever merchandize he may have
introduced into the Indian territory. Neither will you, on any
pretext, whatever, suffer any white person to settle within the limits
aforesaid.—You will exercise the utmost vigilance, and take the most
energetic measures, to prevent the introduction of Ardent Spirits
among the Indians, and if any be found within the district, you will
seize and destroy it.—To carry into full effect these instructions you
are authorised to make such use and disposition of the Military
force under your command as you may judge proper.”

JOSEPH S. SANCHES Esq." United States Marshall for the District of
East Florida St Augustine.
SIR, Evidence having been furnished to the President that indi-
viduals have intruded themselves upon the military reservation at
Tampa Bay, East Florida,” he directs that you proceed without
delay, and remove them therefrom under the provisions of the Act
of March 3" 1807,” entitled “An Act to prevent settlements being
made on lands ceded to the United States until authorized by law.”
You will satisfy yourself of the shortest period within which the
intruders can make their arrangements for removal, and depart
from the reservation without serious loss or sacrifice of the property
which they may have to take away with them, and you will take
care promptly to make known to them that it is expected they will
not delay beyond that period, as, should they do so, it will become
your duty to remove them by force. It is hoped however that a
resort to force for this purpose, which by the Act above mentioned
the President is authorized to employ, will not be necessary but that
they will promptly depart on being informed of the determination of
the Executive not to permit them to remain. Should you, however,
unfortunately be obliged to resort to force in order to accomplish the
object of these instructions, you are authorized to call for such as
you may deem absolutely necessary, on the commanding Officer at
Fort Brooke, Tampa Bay, who will be instructed to comply with
your requisition. In this event, also, you will act with as much
forbearance, consideration and delicacy, as may be consistent with
a prompt and faithful performance of the duty hereby assigned you;
first fully and mildly explaining the folly of resistance on their part,
and your own want of discretion in the matter.

which I invite the particular attention of the Department. You will
perceive from his several letters that the Secretary, considers himself
independent of the authority of the Governor, and at liberty to leave
the Territory, for any length of time he may think proper. In regard
to the duties required of that officer by law, I beg leave to refer you
to the 3r" and 4* Sections of the several acts of Congress organizing
the Territorial Government, and particularly those of March the
30* 1822.” and March the 3" 1824." It is known to you that Mr
Duval left the Territory on the 15" of May 1837, the very day on
which he was appointed Secretary, and notwithstanding the repeated
orders of the Department, he did not return until the 16" of October
following.” During the spring of 1838, he applied to you for leave of
absence, which was refused, but he left Tallahassee and went to S*
Joseph’s, and was at the seat of Government only a few days between
the months of May and November, as will appear by the enclosed
certificate of Mr R. B. Copeland, my private Secretary.” He has now
left the Territory with his family to spend some time in Virginia
notwithstanding my expressed disapprobation of this measure—
I desire that the whole correspondence on the subject may be read,
but ask particular attention to M. Duvals letter of the 2" Ins”
A copy of that letter was industriously circulated by M. Duval among
certain persons on the day it bears date, just as he was in the act of
leaving this place, and before he deposited the original in the Post
office from whence I received it, more than 24 hours after his de-
parture—It contains many false statements, but there is onesufficiently
malicious, to justify my proving it false. He says “I presided at a
meeting of the citizens of Tallahasse where you and your minions
were severely rebuked for your covert attack upon the President, and
Secretary of War.” The proceedings of the meeting to which he refers
a copy of which is herewith enclosed, marked B." proves his statement
to be false. Further evidence of his disregard of truth is given by the
enclosed extract from an editorial article of the Newspaper in which
the proceedings of the meeting were published. But proof of the
falsehoods beyond explanation. or contradiction, is given in the pro-
ceedings of the meeting held on the 29th January 1838.* and the cer-

In renewing hostilities against this savage foe, you will, of course,

RESOLUTIONS AND MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY
INHABITANTS OF EAST FLORIDA
[NA:HF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:DS *]
[August 29, 1839]
Division of the Territory, or East Florida a Distinct Territorial
Government.
At a full meeting of the Inhabitants of the City of St. Augustine,
East Florida, held pursuant to public notice, at the Court House, on
Thursday the 29th day of August, 1839, General Joseph M. Hernandez
was appointed President, and Major J. John Beard, Jr. and S. Hill
Williams, Secretaries of the meeting.
The object of the meeting was explained, and the meeting addressed
by Major Putnam, and several other gentlemen. On motion it was
Resolved, That the following gentlemen, viz:—Gabriel W. Perpall,
Esq., Gen. Peter Sken Smith, Col. John M. Hanson, Bernardo Segui,
Esq., and Col. Gad Humphreys, be a Committee to draft Resolutions,
expressive of the sense of the meeting.
The Committee having retired, reported the following resolutions,
which were adopted by acclamation, and without a dissenting voice:
Resolved, That as Floridians—as American citizens—we are grati-
fied at the presence at this time, of the same Men and the same Spirit
that were present in the meeting of the fifth day of February, 1838, to
protest against the calling a Convention to form a State Constitution—
and against the imposition of State Taxes—and, to organize in favor of
“Division.”
Resolved, That we have not, at any time, “yielded” our preferences,
or compromised our principles—we are—as we were, in that first
meeting—“one and all, opposed to being erected into a State with the
Middle and West—and one and all for separating The East, from the
Middle and West—making the Suwannee the dividing line.”
Resolved, That we have organized for ‘Division’ and nothing but
“Division,” and for the purpose of cooperating with our Fellow-
Citizens of The East, for the Division of This Vast Territory—com-
prising as it does, The Country and The Capabilities sufficient for
Two States; the West being nearly equal in size to Massachusetts and
Maryland combined: and nearly as large as South Carolina:—and
the Territory lying East of the “Suwannee” possessing an area ap-
proaching in extent Pennsylvania or New York, and equal in extent to
Tennessee or Michigan.

Resolved, That a glance at our Geographical position, shows that
the natural outlet of the Middle and West, is to the Gulf of Mexico—
while The East has its natural outlet to the Atlantic coast—thus,
from the beginning, nature designed The Separation—That subse-
quently, the conflicting and diversified interests of The Floridas
demanded and obtained—and in seeking Division, we only seek to
establish The Right of Separation that had its foundation in the
Justice and Policy of the Spanish and English Governments, under
which, The Floridas were formed into Two separate Provinces, each
having its own Governor; and they were so ceded by Spain to the
United States.
Resolved, That the Constitution and Laws of the United States
having established the Federal Ratio of State Representation at
Forty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred—and as in the Census that
preceded the late Territorial Convention, the aggregate population
of The Floridas fell Ten Thousand short of the Federal Number, we
consider a “Constitution,” emanating from the representatives of a
minority a Dead Letter—whether approved or rejected by the Territory
at large.
Resolved, That adhering to the principle of “Division,” we do main-
tain the “birth right” of The East to a separate and Independent Terri-
tory East of the Suwannee;" while with mingled feelings of kindness
and respect we would say to the Middle and West “Is not the whole
land before us? Let there be no strife between us, for we be brethren.”
Resolved, That again, as before, we enter our public and solemn
Protest against the premature, impracticable, and ruinous scheme of
precipitating the whole of this great Territory into a single State:—
when the People of The East have, with such commendable unanimity,
rejected both The State and The Constitution, at the Ballot-Box.
Resolved, That the inability, as also the indisposition of The East,
to participate in the mere pageant of A State Government, upheld by
Direct Taxes, is apparent to all—and we should be still more reluctant
to exchange our Territorial Independence for State honors, purchased
by the degrading and humiliating condition, that the Middle and
West pay the Taxes of the East!
Resolved, That we shall support, for office, men who are opposed to
forming The Floridas into a single State, and opposed to the system of
Taxes, inseparable to the adoption of a State Gonernment—and who
are the uncompromising advocates of “Division.”
Resolved, That we respectfully solicit the inhabitants of the Towns
and Counties of the East to hold similar meetings—and we most
*A petition to Congress by some members of the Legislative Council, Jan. 31,

BRIGADIER GENERAL Z. TAYLOR Tampa Bay, Florida,
SIR, I have been directed by the Secretary of War to request that
you will, without delay, authorize the Governor of Florida to raise
a Militia force, not to exceed three hundred men, which must be
mustered into the service of the United States, and organized ac-
cording to the laws and regulations. This force must be furnished
with suitable Staff Officers from the regular troops for the purpose of
providing it with the necessary supplies of subsistence, transporta-
tion &c. It will be placed under the orders of the Governor who will
be authorized to direct its operations.”
You are requested to state, for the information of the Secretary of
War, what amount of Militia force can, in your opinion, be raised
within the territory of Florida, and be relied on for active and efficient
service.
A copy of these instructions has been transmitted to Governor

SIR, I have the honor to inform you since my last communication
from this place, Chitto Tustee Nuggee has been to this post, but not
accompanied by Sam Jones, and some other chiefs as was expected
by Lt Col Harney" with a view to conclude something like a treaty
which has been going on ever since the Col" returned from the Mas-
sacre of Coloosa Hatchee, Chitto brought in thirty two short sticks,
wishing that many days to get some other cheif in, and to make
arrangements as far as I can learn to conclude the treaty &c.
I was requested to attend the meeting but disclaimed all right on
my part to make treaties, being as I considered sent here to enforce
those already made, but at the same time felt bound to protest
against two of the propositions, the first was that of allowing the
Indians to occupy any part of the sea board of Florida, and the

second that the Indians should not be allowed to disturb the property
of wrecked vessels on the coast. It having been proposed that they
should occupy a certain extent of this coast and to take the property
cast on shore, but to save the lives of all on board. I made the
objections above stated that it may not be said that I was present,
and made no opposition, I do not believe that the Indians on this
coast will ever go against those who are on the Coloosa Hatchee, but
they wish to gain time for collecting amunition and stores,
By this attempt at making a second treaty the forces under my
command cannot I find, act against the Indians on the East coast
without coming directly in contact with the views of Col Harney
Commanding this district, which I certainly have every wish to avoid.
I do think that every Indian taken beyond the limits prescribed
in the treaty made by Gen' Macomb should be sent out of Florida,
and should like very much to know if such is, or is not the wish of
the Government. I have been delayed here two days in getting the

MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS BY CITIZENS OF CALHOUN
COUNTY
[NA:SF, 26 Cong., 1 sess.:DS"]
[October 1, 1839]
To the Hon: the Senate & House of Representatives in Congress assem-
bled—
The Undersigned citizens of Calhoun County of which Saint
Joseph is the chief Port & public site, would respectfully urge the
justice and necessity of creating a new District for the collection of
customs to be called the District of Saint Joseph—embracing the
coast east of Choctawhatchee Bay and North and West from Cape
St. Blas, including said Cape, together with the coast and shore
surrounding the Bay of St Joseph-
The increasing resources & trade foreign and coastwise of the
Port of St: Joseph render the establishment of such a District,
important to Government & essential to commerce— The certificate
attached from the Collectors office showing the imports & exports of
the three last years taken in connection with the completion of a
new Rail Road into the interior which will much increase our facilities
& consequently our trade show the reasonableness of the application
now made—
The Committee to whowm may be entrusted the consideration of
this Memorial are respectfully refered for further information touching
the premisses to the Hon the Delegate for Florida
The Undersigned would also ask from your Honourable body an
appropriation for the survey of the Bay of St Joseph and for placing
Buoys on the Bar and middle Ground near the entrance into the
same-Warious opinions predicated upon the Spanish and more recent,
but partial surveys, are entertained as to the depth of water over the
Bar—All however agree that there is sufficient water to admit a
Sloop of War and that the safety of access would be much increased
by Buoys placed at Judicious points—The exposed condition of
commerce and Ships of war on the Gulf in the event of a war with a
marantime power render it the duty and policy of Government to
avail themselves of every Port in which our Wessels might seek safety
and protection—To the Delegate for Florida who is personally ac-

found loc. cit. The signers of both memorials are nearly identical.

[NA:GLO, Reg. and Rec. Lets., Tallahassee:LS]
Land Office at S*AUGUSTINE E. F. October 13" 1839
JAMES WHITCOMB Esq Commissioner of Gen Land Office
SIR Your communication, dated the 26 Ultimo,” did not reach
this office, until the arrival of the mail yesterday, (12” Inst). making
a period of seventeen days.—
You state, that “after the removal (by death), of the late Receiver
of the S* Augustine Land Office, it was discovered, he had issued
a number of receipts for moneys received in payment for the public
lands of which there had not been any entry made; either upon the
Township plats, or books of the Land-Office—thereby defrauding the
Government, and throwing the business of the Office into an almost
inextricable state of confusion”—
With the above facts, we certainly have nothing to do.
You say again “I regret to state, that evidence has been filed in this
office from which it would appear, that the present incumbent, has
been pursuing the same course, several receipts and certified copies of
receipts, have been exhibited here, purporting to be for moneys
received in payment of public lands entered at the S" Augustine
Land Office, and of which no official returns have been made by either
of you.”
* NA(GLO, Lets. to Reg. and Rec., Bk. 11).

642 T E R R ITO RIA L PA P E R S
With this latter clause, we have every thing to do, and trust we
shall be able to explain matters to your entire satisfaction.
That there would be occasionally, official receipts filed in your
office, for lands entered here is no more than what we expected, would
take place, from the preciptancy of individuals in applying for Patents,
and their ignorance of the Forms to be gone through, before they
could obtain them.
We were also aware, that there were other Persons, likely to trouble
the Department unnecessarily—Persons to whom, in consideration of
the distance from which they had come, and their inability to meet,
without great inconvenience, the expense of repeating their journey;
we allowed to enter the Lands they wanted; though they were un-
prepared, from their ignorance of the Lands, to comply strictly with all
the conditions of the Sale.
It was however, only where these deviations from Form were of an
unessential character, and where the difficulty of making a correct
return of the sales, was such as could be easely removed by the party,
on returning to his home; that we permitted entries to be made for
the accomodation of the individual thus circumstanced.
It has sometimes happened, that on refering to the maps, they were
unable to ascertain with certainty, the precise location of the Land they
sought; but requested the indulgence of being allowed to complete
their entries; being willing to take the risk of any errors they might
commit in doing so.
In such cases, that is, where there appeared little likelyhood of the
entries turning out to be erroneous—a Receipt has been issued to the
purchaser, on his engaging to apprise us, should he discover any
mistake on his return home; in order that the error might be corrected;
in accordance with the rules laid down by the Department on this
subject—or to notify us if there was none; so that a Return of the Sale
might be made as early as possible.
Many of the persons thus indulged, have neglected to comply with
their promises—being probably satisfied on finding their Receipt to
correspond with the public Surveys, and therefore troubling them-
selves no further about the matter.
Similar reasons have prevailed in Preemption cases, where we were
satisfied of the justness of the claim; & where the individual who
through ignorance, has presented informal Papers, which could be
easily corrected on returning to his Residence.
In all these cases, the persons were informed, that no Return would
be made of the Sale, & that they could not get their Patents, until
they complied with the formalities of the Law. We presume there-
fore, that the Receipts offered at the Department, have been trans-
fered from the original Holders, and that the Transferees have been

left in ignorance of the conditions remaining to be complied with,
before they can obtain their Patents. In pursuing the course we
have done, in the above cases, we conceived we were forwarding the
views of the Government, by disposing of the public Lands, & at the
same time securing it against fraud—as no Patent could issue, until
the Return was made. We should perhaps sooner have stated, that
in every instance, the sale was duly entered on the maps, & recorded
in the Books of the Office.
If it be the desire of the Department, that a more strict adherence
to Form, be observed for the future, what ever may be the hardships
to individuals; we will receive its commands, and rigidly enforce
them.”
We have the honor to be, Sir, Very Respectfully, Your Ob" Servts—

SJR, The 34 Regiment of Artillery having been much reduced in
numbers and physical strength, it is determined by the War Depart-

fore requested to order the 3" Regiment to be assembled at Garey's
Ferry to await the arrival of the relieving Regiments, which you may
expect at an early day in good condition and complete as to numbers.
The Secretary of War hearing so frequently of the depredations
and murders, committed by the Indians along the line of the settle-
ments, from St. Augustine to the extreme West of the Territory of
Florida, has come to the conclusion of employing the whole of the
regular force under your command, with such as may be added to
it in driving the enemy out of the settlements, by occuping the
country within, and north of a line drawn from Pilatka to the mouth
of Withlacoochee, including Fort King, thence along the western

shall find it practicable, take means for stationing the troops within
the line above marked out, leaving detachments at such points, south
of that line, as you may deem necessary and proper;—but the first
and great object is, to rid the settlements of the marauding parties
of Indians which have so long and so dreadfully annoyed the inhabi-
tants of Florida, by destroying or driving them out of the settlements,
and obliging them to retreat below the line indicated. The cruisers
employed on the coast of Florida, it is presumed, are sufficient to
afford protection from the attacks and depredations of the Indians
to such vessels and their crews as may be stranded. It is not how-
ever intended by this remark to advise the abandonment of the posts
of Tampa and Key Biscayne.—
Besides the Regiment of Artillery mentioned as the relief of the 3"
Regiment of Artillery, six full companies of the 2" Dragoons will
immediately be put in motion under Colonel Twiggs for Florida.—

with, requiring proper explanations of such proceedings and the same
to be accompanied by a list of all such cases and the officers were
advised that unless the explanations were satisfactory I would be
under the necessity of reporting the facts to the Executive—A letter
of explanation from those officers * has been received and deeming
the proceedings therein acknowledged to be not only improper but
contrary to law I beg leave to call your attention to the subject—
The officers accompany their reply with a list which is thus headed,—
“A list of receipts granted to individuals of lands entered on the maps
and recorded on the books of the Land office at St. Augustine, but not
returned to the General Land office for want of the proper formalities
required by law and the regulations of this office.”—
It is preceived however that this entirely omits the three cases of
receipts, copies of which as before stated have been filed in this office—
It thus appears that the Receiver has received moneys on public
account and furnished to individuals evidence thereof without ap-
prizing the Government of his Acts and thereby furnishing the Means
of holding him responsible—
The course of proceeding prescribed in making private entries of
land is for the purchaser to make his application in writing to the
Register, describing the particular tract and on the same paper the
Register is required to certify the fact of such application having been
made and the amount of purchase money payable to the Receiver on
the land—The Receiver is Required to issue Receipts in duplicate,
one of which is for the purchaser and the other is to be handed to the
Register to be entered upon his books—The Register is required to
issue his Certificates of purchase for the same, which Certificates,
with the Receiver's receipts are Required to be forwarded by the
Register with his abtract of Sales at the Close of each Month.—
Neither the Register nor Receiver has rendered abstracts embracing
these cases nor is it known that Certificates have been issued by the
Register for the same, and without which patents cannot issue in any
CaSe-
The Register has addressed a separate letter dated 14* Ultimo"
wherein he disavows any knowledge of receipts being granted ir-
regularly other than those explained in the joint letter—It therefore
would appear that he is ignorant of the three receipts before referred
to and such ignorance can enly be accounted for only on the supposi-
tion that the Receiver withheld the information from him—

SIR, Since my communication of yesterday in relation to the irregu-
lar proceedings of the Land officers at St Augustine an investigation of
the pre-emption claims admitted by them has been made, (the outlines
of which are indicated in the accompanying paper”) which developes
much deviation from the positive provisions of law and prescribed
rules of office, as, in connection with the circumstances set forth in my
communication of yesterday, to require that the affairs not only of the
Receiver's office but also those of the Register's should pass into other
hands—
It is not hereby designed to reflect on the Motives of those officers
but simply to express the opinion that from the little attention they
have bestowed towards qualifying themselves for the duties of their
respective offices during their long term of Service, it seems expedient
for the welfare of the public business that the proposed changes should
be made—

It was my wish to have stoped at, or off the army Posts, on the
eastern Coast, but was only enabled to stop for a few minutes off Fort
Lauderdale, as the leanght of the run is so great, that with the Boat
loaded down with fuel it can be just accomplished, without making
allowances for Gales, or head winds which might prove disastrous: as
even a delay of a few hours, would leave her without fuel, and her
overloaded condition at the commencement of the run would unfit
her for heavy weather, all of which I have stated in a former report.
The Engineer reports the engine out of order and as there is an
Inspector here appointed under the act of Congress; establishing such
an officer. I have requested him in conjunction with the two engi-
neers of the Poinsett to examine into and make a report upon the con-
dition of the Machinery, which report will accompany this.
The Poinsett cannot be run upon this station but at a very heavy
expense, she is useless on the east coast and the Barges can operate
in the Bays, and small rivers, without her assistance, getting their
supplies from our store house at Key Biscayne or being supplied
with army rations as is now done at Fort Lauderdale. The illicit
traffic supposed to be carried on with the Indians where she could
act, does not exist, the whole coast from Key Biscayne South is lined
with wreckers who are jealous of foreigners, and are ready to prevent
their ingress, and this useful class of men are too much interested in
the exterpation of the Indians to refuse any assistance they can render
for this purpose. The great difficulty of obtaining wood operates as
another check, to the efficiency of the Poinsett, she lies idle in Port
whilst we are obtaining fuel for a short run, which is pleasant enough
for one disposed to be inactive, and even when the Barges are all on
duty, a number of officers and men must remain on board as ship
Keepers, and their services are comparatively lost. The Barges
carry the tents for the Crew, and a weeks provisions or more if
required, can move from one point to another, either alone or co-
operating with the land Forces.
I conceive it to be my duty to recommend the withdrawal of the
Poinsett from this station, and to relieve all officers attached to her,
from service in Florida, who rank those who have command of small
vessels on this station, at least such as may request it; it is painful
to me to have the question or rank continually agitated, and I see
there can be no harmony as matters now are—may lead to difficulties
most unpleasant.
Not withstanding the report of the Engineers I must go to Savannah
for funds, and breakout, and cleanse the Poinsett.
There I will await your further orders, should you deem it expedient
to withdraw the Poinsett I can take her to Baltimore, or Norfolk
notwithstanding the state of the engine. I claim the privelege of

by the first opportunity, to join the detachments I have left there,

content to go out in any kind of vessel that may answer the purpose,
either bought, or chartered, I know I shall have many difficulties
to contend with, but neither Yellow Fever—or Indians shall deter me

of the Land Office at S* Augustine but not returned to the General
Land Office for want of proper formalities required by law and the
regulations of this Office”—
I am instructed to call on you for a particular explanation of the
reasons which induced you to give your sanction to the issuing of
receipts in the irregular manner alluded to, without reporting such
informal proceedings to this Office, with the reasons which, under
your own construction of your Official authority and sense of duty,
might be plead in justification of the course pursued, by which this
Office has been Officially uninformed of proceedings evidenced by your
Records,-and until the receipt of the explanation now required under
the President’s direction, and his decision thereon communicated to
you I have it in charge to direct that no further sales be attempted at
your Office—
You are also requested to transmit to this Office the proof under
the pre-emption law of 1834 upon which entries 8–46–47–49–82
(97)—120 (135)–122 (137)–123 (138)–124–134–135–140 (156)–190
(206)–195 (211)–197 (213) and 228 (250) were permitted to be made,”
and also the proof under the pre-emption law of 1830 upon which
entry N° 235 (257) was allowed and in the latter case to report the
date of the filing of the plat in your Office.—
In all the entries of pre-emptions under the Act of 1838 * except
No: 333 You have neglected to require of the claimant the affidavit
pointed out by that Act or if required and furnished by them you
have neglected to transmit the same to this Office. The law not only
makes such affidavit absolutely necessary for the obtaining of a patent
but attaches such penalties to false swearing as to render it an essential
requisite to the proper allowance of the claim, inasmuch as the party
although he should have complied with all the other provisions of the
law is nevertheless not entitled to its benefits if unable truly to make
the affidavit required.
In the instructions of the 3" July 1838" under the Act alluded to,
page 4, in the 4” paragraph, as well as page 6, first paragraph, your
attention was drawn to the provision of the law.
In numerous cases both under the law of 1834 & 1838 you have
admitted entries of single forty acre tracts, and adjoining subdivisions
of the same character, of different quarter Sections, contrary to the
law and instructions.
7 These were Nos the claims then had—These No" have been since altered to
those in red, above—14 May 1846 [Marginal note on the MS. The alterations

The laws of 1834" & 1838 revive that of 1830 * and subdivisions
known to the latter act are therefore alone liable to entry under either
of the former—The forty Acre subdivisions were admitted by a sub-
sequent law,-that of 5" of April 1832 ” entitled “An Act supple-
mentary to the several laws for the sale of public lands”—and are
liable to entry only under the provisions of that Act & according to
the peculiar terms & circumstances pointed out by it—In a large
number also of the cases under the Act of 1838 you have permitted
the entry upon proof, not of the possession by the claimant by personal
residence on the tracts at the times specified by law but “until the
commencement of Indian hostilities”—“until 1835 when Seminole War
compelled an abandonment”—“until driven away by Indian hostili-
ties”—Those cases would have formed possibly good ground for an
application to Congress, but you had no authority to allow them.
In other cases the proof states that the parties were on a Certain
Section, and parts of that Section are entered.—The proof should
have stated them to have been house-keeping &c. on the particular
legal subdivision entered,—as a claimant might have been a Settler
on the North East quarter of a particular Section without being
entitled to enter either of the other three quarters—Warious other
irregularities exist which are capable of correction and need not now
be particularly mentioned as they will form the subject of Special
communications when the cases are separately acted upon-
Your explanation, as speedily as possible, is required on all the
particulars herein set forth and in reference to the cases of receipts,
of which a notarial Copy has been furnished to this Office, (alluded to
in my communication of the 26* September last)” and of which a
copy is herewith furnished, the Secretary of the Treasury requires
that you will report whether the amounts of money therein stated
were included in the returns made by the Receivers to the Department
of moneys on hand.
Notwithstanding the suspension of actual sales of public lands as
herein directed, in case individuals claiming pre-emption privileges
under the Act of 1838 should present to your Office proofs in support
of such claims you are to receive their papers for future Action and
report the fact of your having so done to this Office.
I am respectfully Sir, Your Ob" Serv"

DELEGATE DOWNING TO THE PRESIDENT
[NA:TD, ST Lets. from Congress:LS]
WASHINGTON City Nov 20, 1839
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE U. STATES
SIR. As I have been in this City for more than a month, it was
with surprise & mortification that I learned for the first time on
Sunday last that two important offices in the Territory I represent
had been vacated & filled, nearly a fortnight ago, & I kept in utter
ignorance of the intended removals, as well as of the appointments—
As I have always understood and believed, that the immediate repre-
sentative of a State or Territory was looked to by the adminstration,
as the best source of information as to the fitness of applicants for
offices within his district, more especially where the member or dele-
gate is friendly to the adminstration, I can consider the course pursued
on the two Several occasions alluded to, as furnishing evidence, that
towards me, the common forms of Courtesy & respect, official and
personal, need not be observed.
Believe me Sir, that I should not trouble you on this occasion, but
in justice to the people I represent,-You have removed Mr Duval
and Mr Cleland; of Mr Duval's case I will say nothing, because
I know nothing—I never had an oppertunity to form an opinion,—
With Mr Clelands case, I am now acquainted—There is, as I am now
informed, but one reason for his removal—to wit, that he gave in-
formal receipts, which he did not return to the Land office—Now
this is as plain, as simple and as proper, as any act can be.—A man
rides 150 miles to enter lands and finds the office closed by orders
from Washington, or some other cause to prevent the entry.—he
leaves the money with Cleland, as a private friend, to pay the money
when the land could be entered—this is what Cleland calls an in-
formal receipt—It was entirely a private transaction, with which the
Land office has nothing to do, & intended to save the applicant
another ride to S". Augustine,—Now Sir, Mr Clelands successor, is
not a citizen of Florida, is totally unknown amongst us, & until this
appointment, I who know every body, in that section of the Country,
had never heard of him,-And I venture to predict, that he will be
found to be some relative or protagee of Mr Whitcomb, who finds
him a place, by the removal of Mr Cleland—He is recommended by
a man totally unknown at Washington, and exceedingly obnoxious
to many of the most respectable citizens at home, & who, from
personal and political hatred to Cleland, would recommend any one,
to remove him, or any other of my friends—
Mr Duval's successor I do know, tho' I do not know who pre-
scribed his name to the Executive; and I deeply lament that the

appointment was made, I know nothing to the discredit of M"
M°Kants, but his talents and qualifications do not fit him for such a
station—And I look upon Florida as peculiarly unfortunate; left as
she is to her own resources for defence, from the deadly foe that
threatens under the defensive system now adopted by the war dep"
to desolate her fields forever, in having those resources liable to be
placed by many contingencies in the hands of one so little able to use
them, for her benefit, or defence—
I will close this letter Sir, by most respectfully, but earnestly
urging, that removals so unjust, appointments so unsatisfactory, may
if possible be arrested, and that if these vacances must be made, other
names may be sent in their stead, to the Senate—

THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO THE PRESIDENT
[LC:Van Buren Papers: LS]
WAR DEPARTMENT Nov. 29. 1839
SIR. A state of things has for some time past existed in Florida,
which I feel compelled at length to bring to your notice. As long as
I did not apprehend any serious embarrassment to the public service
from the conduct of the Governor of that Territory I avoided all
mention of it, and if its effects were likely to be confined to multiplying
the difficulties of this department I would continue to pass it over as I
have done for so long a period. But the theatre of operations is about
to be changed to Middle Florida and it has become necessary to
transport thither the greater portion of the regular forces hitherto em-
ployed in the South. Thus brought into the neighborhood of the
civil authorities the success of the measures of the general will depend
altogether upon their cordial cooperation with him. It cannot be
denied that such a result cannot be expected so long as the present
Governor remains in power. He failed to acquire the respect of the
army of the South when entrusted with the command of it by your
immediate Predecessor; and ever since that period an unfriendly
feeling has existed between the military and civil authorities to the

FL OR I D A T E R R ITO R Y 657
great inconvenience of the service. This feeling constantly mani-
fested by the Governor has lately been so openly avowed as to produce
an effect upon all connected with the regular army, which if not
counteracted may be attended with unpleasant and disasterous
consequences. But the least of the many evil results of the pro-
tracted hostilities in Florida has been the unfriendly feelings which
have sprung up between the regulars and militia serving there. From
the nature of our institutions the success of all military operations is
dependent upon the cooperation of those forces; and in the present
state of the Treasury I have not the means if I had the inclination to
enable me to withdraw the regular troops and substitute militia. In
employing the former in preference I consult both economy and effi-
ciency, and I should not be justified in making any other disposition
of that portion now in Florida than has been done. Besides Governor
Call, dissatisfied with the rejection of his offers to enlist a large body
of militia for the service in Florida and of the urgent recommenda-
tions of his friends to have the whole command and conduct of the
war entrusted to him, has publicly declared his intention to propose
to the Legislature of Florida to furnish the necessary funds to provide
for an army to act under the authority of the Territory, promising in
that case to receive in the service certain militia corps assembled under
the expectation of the success of this extraordinary application. Such
a measure would bring this department into direct collision with the
civil authorities of the Territory & involve the Government in great
immediate expense as well as lay the foundation of interminable
claims upon the treasury.
I am therefore reluctantly compelled to ask the removal of the
present Governor as a measure rendered necessary by the character
of the troops to be employed in Middle Florida, & by the previous
conduct and public declarations of this Functionary.”
I have the honor to be Very respectfully Yr most obe" Ser"

INDEX NOTE
In compiling the list of names of persons for this index, deficiencies in spelling
found in the text have been corrected, in so far as sources now available permit,
and variants found throughout the text have been assembled in parentheses. The
nearly illegible character of the handwriting in some instances, which leaves the
reader in doubt as to the writer's intent, and the obvious ignorance, or careless-
ness, often displayed by the signatories account for many variations in orthog-
raphy. With respect to the signers of petitions, like names, with identical spell-
ing, are also frequently attached to successive documents on related subjects from
the same locality; yet a comparison of the handwriting discloses occasional impor-
tant differences. In such instances separate entries have been made in the index,
though the reader is warned that names were often written in by hands other than
the subscribers’; finality in this regard cannot therefore be established in every
case. On the other hand the fact that the same name is variously spelled in
sequential documents does not argue against identity of person, which is likewise
disclosed by a comparison of handwriting as well as by such other tests as docu-
ments of legal record, genealogical data, and whatever knowledge of the various
residences of a given person may be derived from the papers embodied in the
present volume. But whenever there is doubt as to such identity a separate
entry has been made. In some instances the index material is organized according
to office or function under a duplication of the principal entry (see DuVal, Wil-
liam P.).
Names of English origin have been listed in the index as written (if the signature
was not by mark); but Spanish names, which often appear in the text written
phonetically, with much variation, have been entered in the index under the
forms commonly used in available sources, followed by their variants in paren-
theses.
